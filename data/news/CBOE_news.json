REUTERS\/Clodagh Kilcoyne  This signals how the bloc will keep up pressure on new hubs to meet licence terms, even if Britain secures a divorce settlement with a standstill transition period to the end of 2020 after the deadline for Brexit.  And it echoes pressure from the European Central Bank (ECB) on new EU banking hubs.  More than 300 investment firms, asset managers, banks, insurers and trading platforms in London have opened hubs in other EU countries in preparation for business after Britain\u2019s planned departure, which has now been delayed three times.  As a result of Brexit, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has entered a \u201ccompletely new area of supervisory convergence\u201d to avoid unfair competition, its chair Steven Maijoor told the European Parliament on Monday.  ESMA had intervened in more than 230 relocations to make sure they included enough personnel in the newly-opened or enlarged \u201cEU27\u201d offices as British-based firms sought to keep as much activity and \u201csubstance\u201d in Britain, he said. EU27 refers to the remaining 27 countries in the bloc after Britain leaves.  \u201cThe EU27 interest is to make sure the entity in the EU27 has sufficient substance, that it can be supervised, that there is a governance body that is really in charge of that entity,\u201d Maijoor said.  \u201cWe have also agreed on a peer review next year to assess how these relocations have been conducted.\u201d  ESMA has said that Brexit will inevitably mean market fragmentation and three UK share trading platforms have opened EU hubs for trading EU27 listed stocks after Brexit, although UK regulators are keen for EU investors to be allowed to continue trading euro zone shares in London to keep markets intact.  Maijoor also called for EU rules to define a \u201cgreen\u201d bond, as definitions for bonds that raise funds for environmentally-friendly projects have been written by the industry.  \u201cWhat you see now is because of the risk of greenwashing ... that there is increasing demand for clarity in this area. My personal opinion is that it is now time to come up with a regulatory measure,\u201d Maijoor said.

FILE PHOTO: Financial traders work at their desks at CMC Markets in the City of London, Britain, April 11, 2019. REUTERS\/Peter Nicholls\/File Photo  Analysts say a showdown over share trading between Brussels and Switzerland is a reminder to London what it could face after Brexit if it clashed with the bloc in financial regulation.  The EU has refused to renew Switzerland\u2019s regulatory \u201cequivalence\u201d which allows investment firms in the bloc to trade on Swiss exchanges directly. Bern is retaliating with an order that Swiss shares can only be traded on Swiss exchanges from Monday.  In a sign that European regulators\u2019 attitudes towards Britain are hardening, Natasha Cazenave, head of international policy at French markets watchdog AMF, said trading in EU-listed shares should take place inside the bloc after Brexit.  Shares in some of the biggest companies from across the EU are currently traded on their home exchange and in London on pan-European platforms Cboe CBOE.Z, Aquis AQX.L and Turquoise LSE.L.  Cboe alone accounts for over 20 percent of trading in German, Dutch, Belgian, French, Swedish, and Spanish shares.  The bloc\u2019s markets regulator, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), ruled in May that in the event of a no-deal Brexit in October, investment firms in the EU must trade about 6,000 EU-listed shares on exchanges in the bloc.  This would force funds and other users to redirect trading from London to the EU.  Cazenave said the AMF \u201cstrongly supports\u201d ESMA\u2019s stance, saying it could also form the basis for future relations between the EU and Britain in share trading.  \u201cIt\u2019s a pragmatic and straightforward approach, that provides clarity to stakeholders on what would be required in the event of a no-deal Brexit,\u201d Cazenave told Reuters.  \u201cHopefully Britain will reciprocate,\u201d Cazenave said.  The EU ruling is known as a share trading obligation (STO), but Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has yet to formulate its own.  Reciprocating would mean Britain adopting an STO that required UK investment firms to trade UK shares in Britain, but made no reference to where EU shares should be traded, some of which have a dual listing in London.  Cazenave said a situation where a UK STO and an EU STO do not overlap could become the ready-made basis of cross-border share trading between Britain and the EU in future.  It would mean Britain not having to seek the same type of equivalence share trading deal from Brussels after Brexit that has come unstuck for Switzerland.  Britain has said it should have no problem obtaining equivalence from Brussels for UK exchanges to continue serving EU customers. FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey has said that investors should have a choice on where to trade.  Aquis has described ESMA\u2019s STO as a \u201cland grab\u201d by an EU wanting to build up its own capital market after Brexit by splitting liquidity and damaging prices.  It, along with Cboe and Turquoise, have set up new hubs in Amsterdam and Paris to cater for any post-Brexit situation that arises.  \u201cFragmentation is due to Brexit and not Europe,\u201d Cazenave said.  A senior exchange official said Brexit has made the EU realise how the STO, meant to be a technical provision, is a powerful political tool in Brussels\u2019 armoury.  \u201cIt\u2019s a warning shot to Britain about what happens if you don\u2019t get a Brexit deal. It\u2019s mutual self-destruction if both sides apply hard STOs and won\u2019t be beneficial to anybody,\u201d the official said.","4":"(Adds more detail)  LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange said its pan-European share trading arm Turquoise will offer trading in EU-listed shares on its Dutch platform from the end of next month if there is no agreement on future direct access to the bloc by then.  Brussels is assessing whether to allow Britain\u2019s financial sector to serve EU investors under its \u201cequivalence\u201d system, which checks if UK market rules are as robust as those in the EU.  After Britain left the EU last January, direct access to the single market under transition arrangements ends on Dec. 31.  \u201cTurquoise can confirm that it is planning on invoking its Brexit contingency plans on Monday 30 November 2020, unless relevant equivalence decisions to allow cross-border services between the EU and UK are agreed prior to this date,\u201d the UK exchange said in a statement. All shares would still be available for trading in London as well.  The LSE set up its Dutch hub as insurance against no direct access to EU investors.  CBOE, the biggest pan-European share trading platform, which is based in London, has also set up a hub in Amsterdam that is already open for business but with little trading so far, while London-based Aquis Exchange has set up its Brexit hub in Paris.  Without equivalence, EU investors would have to trade EU companies inside the bloc, even though many of them are heavily traded in London.  Banks have warned that fragmenting trading liquidity would make markets less efficient for users.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The instrument, known as a \u201cconsolidated tape\u201d, has long been a cherished goal for users of Europe\u2019s fragmented stock markets currently faced with about 20 trading venues, some offering the same stocks.  The tape distributes real time trade and quotes from trading venues in the market. The United States introduced such a tape decades ago to bolster efficiency in trading by knitting together platforms.  The EU\u2019s revised \u201cMiFID II\u201d securities rules, introduced in 2018, gave Brussels powers to appoint a provider if a private sector tape for a reasonable cost remains elusive.  The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is reviewing how MiFID II is working, but it told the EU\u2019s financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis last week that due to Brexit, this work is being delayed by 6-24 months.  \u201cWe are currently assessing those delays by ESMA,\u201d Dombrovskis told the European Parliament\u2019s economic affairs committee on Tuesday.  \u201cWe will assess whether it\u2019s time to consider establishing more market transparency by means of a consolidated tape. We would like ESMA to prioritize this report. The U.S. markets have such a tape, so we would consider to introduce one in the EU.\u201d  He wants ESMA\u2019s report on a tape by early 2020.  It is part of a wider battle between exchanges and their biggest customers over the price of share trading data, with big funds asking Brussels to intervene.  FESE, Europe\u2019s exchanges industry body, published a report last month which it said showed bourses were not gouging customers with high charges.  The report also said that data vendors were already offering a de facto tape for prices on the bulk of the so-called \u201clit\u201d exchanges, where prices and trades are instantly visible.  Dombrovskis said initial lessons could be drawn from MiFID.  \u201cWe intend to look at consumer protection issues, as well as take a deeper look at the operation of equities and bond markets,\u201d he told EU lawmakers.  Asset managers have become less willing to pay as much for research for picking stocks to buy following MiFID II, which forces some brokers to scale back their coverage of small- and medium-sized (SME) companies.  \u201cWe will assess how the unbundling of investment research from brokerage has worked out, and whether we need to adjust this unbundling rule. We have been receiving a lot of complaints, especially on the SME side in this area,\u201d Dombrovskis said.","6":"Nov 5 (Reuters) - Cboe Global Markets Inc:  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS REPORTS OCTOBER 2018 TRADING VOLUME  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS - AT CFE, VIX FUTURES HAD MONTHLY VOLUME OF 9.66 MILLION CONTRACTS IN OCT  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS INC - OCTOBER 2018 OPTIONS TOTAL ADV 9.4 MILLION CONTRACTS, UP 36.1 PERCENT  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS INC - OCT.

FILE PHOTO: People walk through the lobby of the London Stock Exchange in London, Britain August 25, 2015. REUTERS\/Suzanne Plunkett\/File Photo  Britain is due to leave the EU on Oct. 31, but has yet to agree a divorce settlement with the bloc.  Brussels has said that if there is a no-deal Brexit, investment firms in the EU must trade about 6,200 euro-denominated shares in the bloc; many are currently heavily traded in London.  \u201cIt is therefore easy to conclude that for those shares, market liquidity would be damaged to no good end,\u201d Financial Conduct Authority Chief Executive Andrew Bailey said in a speech at Bloomberg.  The FCA will decide soon how to reciprocate on share trading, and Brussels has urged the watchdog not to require UK firms to trade euro shares in Britain as this would create an overlap that fragments trading.  Bailey said the best solution would be for Brussels to grant so-called temporary equivalence, or allow cross border share trading to continue in the event of a no-deal Brexit, as it has already done with derivatives clearing.  \u201cThe EU have said to date they will not do that,\u201d he added.  Equivalence is the main form of EU financial market access for non-member state countries. Brussels decides whether a foreign firm\u2019s rules are aligned enough with those in the bloc.  \u201cWe stand ready to enter into dialogue with our European counterparts before we finalise our approach,\u201d Bailey said.  Brussels has granted temporary equivalence for derivatives clearing so that EU customers could continue using clearing houses in London, but only until March 2020 if there is a no-deal Brexit.  This reflected Britain\u2019s original plan to leave the EU in March, and Bailey said Brussels would need to grant an extension soon to avoid costly disruption in markets.  Without an extension, clearing houses in Britain like the London Stock Exchange\u2019s LCH may have to tell EU customers by December to begin closing or moving derivatives positions from Britain by the end of March.  \u201cUltimately, the best solution is for the EU to grant permanent recognition to UK CCPs (clearing houses),\u201d Bailey said.  The EU is keen to build up its own capital market capacity for trading and clearing to avoid relying on London after Brexit and has made it clear that granting permanent equivalence would not be automatic.  Bailey said British rules would be identical to those in the bloc on day one of Brexit, meaning equivalence should not be an issue.  Britain, however, must not end up being a \u201ctaker\u201d of EU rules, or having to copy the bloc\u2019s regulation after Brexit for years to come to maintain EU access, he said.","9":"LONDON (Reuters) - Parts of the financial sector were still not ready for a no-deal Brexit in October that would split the industry, the European Union\u2019s executive body said on Wednesday.  Although Oct. 31 is the third deadline for Brexit, the European Commission said that some \u201cresidual\u201d preparations for a no-deal exit remain for insurance and payments companies, and access to market infrastructure.  Financial companies using London as a gateway to the EU - their most important customers - have had to open subsidiaries in the bloc to ensure continuity of service in case of a no-deal departure.  Staff relocations, however, have been kept to a minimum after Brexit was pushed back for a second time.  \u201cThe Commission is working with EU-level and national supervisors to ensure that firms\u2019 contingency plans are fully implemented, and it expects that UK supervisors will not prevent firms from implementing such plans,\u201d an update from the Commission on its no-deal Brexit plans said.  \u201cHowever, if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement on 31 October 2019, this will necessarily result in some market fragmentation in financial services,\u201d the EU executive said.  Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has cautioned banks not to leave their UK operations with too few senior officials to monitor risks.  Plans by trading platforms in London, such as Cboe and Aquis to move trading in EU27 shares to new EU hubs have also been put on hold after the FCA and EU clashed over where shares can be traded by the bloc\u2019s investors.  Simon Morris, a financial lawyer at CMS in London, said British regulators were committed to ensuring open financial markets, and have repeatedly emphasised the importance of maintaining EU-wide regulatory cooperation.  \u201cThere is, therefore, every likelihood that the FCA and the Prudential Regulation Authority will cooperate with their EU counterparts to ensure continuity of provision of cross-border services after even the most disorderly Brexit,\u201d Morris said.  The EU executive said in its update on Wednesday that it was committed to stable and open financial markets.  But it was working with member states to \u201cpreserve financial stability and avoid harming the level playing field in the single market for financial services\u201d.  National regulators across the EU have been told by Brussels they cannot soften requirements on staffing new hubs to lure business from London.","10":"(Repeat of item initially transmitted on Friday, Feb. 28)  NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders may be surging in the polls ahead of Super Tuesday, but some on Wall Street have made their own conclusions on what November will bring: four more years of President Donald Trump.  Ninety-five percent of participants in a Deutsche Bank survey of investors, economists and other market participants released earlier this month said Trump, a Republican, was either \u201cextremely likely\u201d or \u201cslightly likely\u201d to win the general election.  Those results contrast with some wider recent polls cited on RealClearPolitics, which show any Democrat beating Trump in a presidential contest, although top contenders have a bigger lead. The latest Reuters\/Ipsos poll, conducted Feb. 19-25, showed Sanders with a seven percentage-point lead over Trump in a hypothetical general election matchup.  The sharp mismatch in expectations could stoke market volatility if Wall Streeters are wrong and a Democrat emerges victorious - especially if that winner is Sanders, whose promises to break up big banks, take on drug companies and essentially abolish private insurance in favor of a single government-run plan have unnerved some investors. Many on Wall Street were unprepared for Trump\u2019s win in 2016, which was followed by sharp swings in asset prices.  \u201cAs an investor, I look at this and say the market\u2019s nightmare scenario is that Bernie or Elizabeth Warren wins the election,\u201d said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, in New York. \u201cThat\u2019s not our base case ... but it\u2019s a concern,\u201d he said.  Warren\u2019s policy proposals, like Sanders\u2019, have also jangled nerves on Wall Street.  Investors will be looking ahead to next Tuesday, when 14 states will cast ballots and Sanders could build an overwhelming advantage if he captures the lion\u2019s share of the available delegates.  Those primaries come as the markets are gripped by concerns over the economic fallout from the spreading coronavirus outbreak, with the number of cases beyond China accelerating rapidly. U.S. stocks were extending the week\u2019s losses on Friday and were on track for a 7th day in the red after the S&P 500 on Thursday confirmed its fastest correction in history.  Orlando said Sanders\u2019 rise in the polls also contributed to the recent sell-off. Some investors noted that continued volatility in markets or an economic downturn could wear away at Trump\u2019s support.  While the market gyrations are likely to drown out some of the potential impact from next week\u2019s voting results, some corners are already feeling the effects of Sanders\u2019 recent success.  After Sanders\u2019 commanding victory in the Nevada caucuses in February, shares of insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc and Centene Corp sold off on what some analysts said were concerns over the potential of a Sanders nomination.  \u201cIf Bernie runs the table and suddenly he becomes unstoppable, I think we\u2019re going to see the jitters again,\u201d said Teresa McRoberts, a portfolio manager focused on healthcare at Fred Alger Management in New York.  The effects on the broader market of a big Sanders win on Tuesday are less clear. Only 13% of participants in Deutsche Bank\u2019s poll believed Sanders could beat Trump in the general election, compared with 22% for former Vice President Joe Biden and 45% for former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, Texas, has kept most of his attention on the coronavirus outbreak in recent days and is not eager to make any election-related portfolio moves yet.  \u201cI think most of my clients pretty much are like me, thinking Trump is going win,\u201d he said.  Still, some investors believe the election can fuel market swings this year.  Volume on the October futures contract for the Cboe Volatility Index hit 16,247 between Jan. 2 and Feb. 21, according to Cboe Global Markets. That dwarfs the 471 contracts that traded in 2016 from Jan. 4 to Feb. 19. VIX futures reflect expectations for volatility in the month following their expiration.  On Thursday, October VIX futures traded at 22.5, versus 19.57 for September futures and 20.22 for November futures, indicating heightened expectations for volatility near election day.  Cboe Global Markets listed October VIX futures a month earlier than usual in response to customers eager to place bets on election-induced volatility, said Kevin Davitt, senior instructor at the exchange\u2019s options institute. The exchange also listed September and November futures ahead of their usual schedule.  Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said the election will become a greater concern for investors once the Democratic party selects its nominee.  \u201cThere are a number of places where the policy divides are incredibly wide,\u201d he said.","11":"March 11 (Reuters) - Cboe Global Markets Inc:  * CBOE EUROPE RECEIVES AUTHORISATION TO OPERATE NETHERLANDS VENUE  * CBOE EUROPE WILL OFFER THE SAME SERVICES AT BOTH ITS UK AND NETHERLANDS VENUES  * CBOE EUROPE SAYS VENUE TO LAUNCH APRIL 1.

Cboe Global Markets, Nasdaq Inc and Intercontinental Exchange Inc\u2019s NYSE Arca all submitted filings with the SEC in the past week that if approved would reduce the barriers to launching new ETFs.  The filings come after the SEC voted in September to harmonize its own rules on ETFs, which in the first quarter of 2019 made up more than 18% of U.S. equity trading by share volume and more than 27% by dollar volume.  Lowering the barriers to entry for new ETFs that fall within an open-fund structure will spur competition by enabling issuers to bring more ETFs to market in a more timely fashion, allowing them to better react to market conditions, said Laura Morrison, Cboe\u2019s global head of listings.  \u201cThere are a lot of very large asset managers who have not issued ETFs in the past who are now speaking to us about it,\u201d she said in an interview.  The SEC\u2019s new rule, which applies to the vast majority of ETFs that currently exist, replaces more than 300 exemptive orders issued by the SEC since 1992 that ETF companies have said inadvertently gave some firms a competitive advantage.  \u201cThis decision encourages innovation in the ETF industry and fosters a more compelling marketplace for launching and trading ETFs,\u201d said Douglas Yones, NYSE\u2019s head of exchange traded products.  Between January 2007 and early April 2019, the median processing time when applying for an exemptive order to permit an ETF to operate as an investment company under the Investment Company Act was 213 days, and the cost was around $100,000, the SEC said in September.  The SEC\u2019s ETF rule eliminates the exemptive relief requirement for most of the funds. The rule does not apply to unit investment trust ETFs, leveraged and inverse ETFs, or non-transparent active ETFs.  The exchanges have also proposed eliminating the quarterly reports they file to the SEC highlighting issues with the funds.

REUTERS\/Jonathan Ernst\/File Photo  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator on Tuesday proposed a change to the way exchange operators alter their fees, in a move aimed at improving transparency but which could make it harder for operators to compete on price to propel revenue growth.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed that operators submit requests to change fees for such services as market data and connectivity with other exchanges, and then seek industry feedback before any changes can be implemented.  At present, operators - such as New York Stock Exchange-owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc, Nasdaq Inc and Cboe Global Markets Inc - notify the regulator of fee changes, which then take immediate effect. The system effectively allows operators to compete on price in real time.  In May, the SEC said securities exchange operators must do a better job of describing and justifying their fees when they make a filing, or else the filing will be suspended for review.  Tuesday\u2019s proposal, which is subject to public consultation before adoption, comes after a years-long dispute over what many brokers and investors see as soaring costs for services essential for trading, but which are also major revenue drivers for most exchange operators.  Exchanges lodge hundreds of fee-related filings with the SEC each year. Under current rules - known as the National Market System plan, or Regulation NMS - fee changes become effective immediately to ensure retail investors get the best price possible. NMS also prevents trades being executed at prices inferior to bid and offer prices displayed at other trading venues.  Under Tuesday\u2019s proposal, the delay before implementing changes could make it tougher for exchange operators to compete quickly on price, potentially limiting future revenue growth.  \u201cThe fees charged by NMS plans affect a wide variety of investors and market participants,\u201d SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in a statement. \u201cThis rulemaking will help ensure that NMS plan fee changes benefit from review and comment by investors and market participants before those fees can be charged.\u201d","17":"LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union will have a \u201cPlan B\u201d that relocates clearing of euro-denominated derivatives from London to the bloc if it decides against long-term access for Britain, a top EU regulator said on Wednesday.  FILE PHOTO: A worker shelters from the rain as he passes the London Stock Exchange in the City of London at lunchtime October 1, 2008. REUTERS\/Toby Melville  The London Stock Exchange's LSE.L LCH unit has been given EU permission, known as equivalence, to continue clearing derivatives for customers in the bloc for 18 months after Dec. 31, when Britain's Brexit transition arrangements expire. ICE ICE.N and the London Metal Exchange has similar permission.  LCH clears the vast majority of euro-denominated swaps, an activity core to London\u2019s role as a global financial centre and which EU has long wanted to be in the bloc.  Long-term EU access for UK clearers would partly hinge on good relations between its regulator, the European Securites and Markets Authority (ESMA), and the Bank of England, the home regulator for LCH.  \u201cEquivalence assumes good cooperation and we work very well with the Bank of England, but as a fallback plan it\u2019s important to assess if there could be an argument to relocate those activities to the EU,\u201d ESMA chair Steven Maijoor told Reuters.  The regulator will assess how a \u201ccredible plan\u201d for relocating euro clearing would look and work, he said.  \u201cPlan A is to support global capital markets and have equivalence, but you need to have a Plan B and need to invoke the Plan B if a clearing house is so systemically relevant... or if cooperation is not working as expected,\u201d he said.  Banks have been reluctant to shift positions from London because of costs and complexity, but a detailed relocation blueprint would make it harder for them to drag their feet.  TRADING OBLIGATION  Maijoor said ESMA will make a policy statement soon on where EU investors are \u201cobliged\u201d to trade EU listed shares, the clearest sign so far of how cross-border trading in the City of London might be curtailed.  \u201cWhat I expect that we come up with is very much in line with previous publications on this matter,\u201d Maijoor said.  ESMA has said that in general shares of EU listed companies should be traded inside the bloc.  A similar statement on swaps trading will come before year end.  Markets are braced for potential volatility when full Brexit takes place on Dec. 31 and Europe\u2019s biggest financial centre decouples from the bloc.  But Majoor said a survey by ESMA of national regulators showed overall satisfaction with preparedness of market participants.  \u201cThere are no special additional actions from us but we will closely monitor markets,\u201d he said.  Regulators were more concerned that current market valuations are back up to pre-COVID levels despite a \u201cgrim\u201d economic outlook, Maijoor said.  Markets suffered bouts of extreme volatility when economies entered lockdown in March to fight the pandemic.  \u201cWe are concerned about possible other rounds of volatility related to COVID and how the development of the second wave of infections will develop,\u201d he said.","18":"LONDON (Reuters) - Banks and asset managers in Britain can continue using exchanges in the European Union to trade shares from January, Britain\u2019s financial regulator said, contrasting with a more restrictive EU approach that poses a risk to London\u2019s market dominance.  FILE PHOTO: British Union Jack flag and European Union flag are seen at the courtyard of the Prime Minister's Office in Luxembourg, September 16, 2019. REUTERS\/Yves Herman  Britain left the EU in January and full access to the bloc under transition arrangements ends on Dec. 31, leaving both sides to decide - in the continued absence of accords on two-way financial market access - where investors in their jurisdictions can trade, known as the share trading obligation or STO.  The EU\u2019s securities watchdog ESMA has already said that from January investors from the bloc can only trade EU company shares in London if the shares have a sterling listing.  This would split markets by forcing chunks of trading in euros to move to the EU from London, Europe\u2019s centre for multi-currency cross-border stock trading on platforms such as the London Stock Exchange\u2019s Turquoise, Cboe, and Aquis Exchange.  The three London-based platforms accounted for nearly 30% of pan-European share trading on Tuesday, worth about 10 billion euros ($11.7 billion).  Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said on Wednesday it would allow firms it regulates to continue trading all EU shares on trading venues headquartered in the bloc, where they choose to do so, refusing to mirror ESMA\u2019s currency restrictions.  The FCA said its stance would keep international markets open and preserve the ability of UK-based firms to execute their share trades where they can get the best deal for customers.  \u201cWhile we note ESMA\u2019s recent clarifications to reduce the potential overlap of an EU and UK STO, we chose this simple and comprehensive approach rather than to replicate restrictions based on the jurisdiction of the share issuer, or the currency in which a share is issued,\u201d said Nausicaa Delfas, the FCA\u2019s head of international.  The best solution would be for the EU to grant full share trading access for Britain under its \u201cequivalence\u201d regime, she said, but Brussels has yet to say if it will grant such access.  John Liver, a financial services partner at consultants EY, said the FCA statement would prove a boost for competition and choice in share trading that would be welcomed by the industry.  Banking and markets body AFME said the FCA statement would help minimise disruption, and that it supported open markets and global competition between trading venues.  Turquoise, Cboe and Aquis have set up EU hubs in anticipation of a clash in share trading requirements.  Cboe said it was operationally ready for both UK and EU STOs. Turquoise, which will launch its Amsterdam hub on Nov. 30 if the EU has not granted access to Britain by then, declined to comment. Aquis had no immediate comment.","19":"LONDON (Reuters) - Amsterdam has displaced London as Europe\u2019s biggest share trading centre after Britain left the European Union\u2019s single market, and picked up a chunk of UK derivatives business along the way, according to data published on Thursday.  Stock exchanges in the Dutch capital traded 9.2 billion euros ($11.15 billion) a day in January, compared to London\u2019s 8.6 billion, according to the Cboe exchange, which operates in both cities.  This compares with an average of 17.5 billion euros traded daily in London during 2020, when Frankfurt was second with 5.9 billion and Amsterdam sixth at 2.6 billion, Cboe said.  The City of London had long warned of the consequences of leaving the EU single market without adequate provisions for trade in services, and notably finance, which accounted for more than 10% of UK tax receipts before Brexit.  The EU\u2019s securities watchdog ESMA said on Thursday the shift of share trading from London to the bloc is permanent.  The EU has shown no sign of reversing its position that euro-denominated shares must be traded in the EU - whose internal market Britain left on Jan. 1.  The gap may narrow, however, as trading in Swiss shares resumed in Britain this month. It is averaging 250 million euros and is expected to build up towards over a billion euros a day - the level reached before trading of Swiss shares in London stopped in June 2019.  Separate data published on Thursday showed how chunks of trading in euro-denominated interest rate swaps have shifted from London, the world\u2019s biggest swaps trading centre, to platforms in the EU and New York since January.  Platforms in Amsterdam, and to a much lesser extent Paris, accounted for a quarter of the euro rate swaps market in January, up from just 10% last July, IHS Markit said.  Over the same period, London\u2019s share fell from just under 40% to just over 10%, with U.S. platforms doubling volumes to 20% of the total euro swaps market.  \u2018PROGRESSIVE EQUIVALENCE DISCUSSIONS\u2019  As with shares, the swaps market has been fragmented by Brussels \u201cobliging\u201d EU-based firms to trade interest rate swaps and credit default swaps either on a platform inside the bloc, or in a non-EU country whose platforms have been approved for use, such as the United States.  London has not yet secured that \u201cequivalence\u201d because Brussels says it needs information about Britain\u2019s intentions to diverge from EU rules.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said London had already supplied the necessary paperwork and was \u201cone of the world\u2019s most pre-eminent financial centres, with a strong regulatory system\u201d, adding that fragmenting markets was in no one\u2019s interests.  The EU\u2019s financial services chief Mairead McGuinness said on Thursday the bloc will discuss equivalence with Britain \u201cprogressively\u201d and take into account its intentions regarding rules on a case-by-case basis, but there \u201ccannot be equivalence and wide divergence\u201d.  One of her senior officials has said the three-way split between Britain, the EU and United States in swaps due to the EU \u201cderivatives trading obligation\u201d or DTO will not be reversed.  \u201cFor the foreseeable future, all three jurisdictions will have trading venues that offer all currencies in such volumes that keep the DTO in all currencies,\u201d Tilman Lueder, head of securities markets at the EU executive, told a Bloomberg event.

Over 6 billion euros in daily trading left London on Jan. 4 for EU-based platforms.  The rise of Amsterdam, home to the world\u2019s oldest stock exchange, had been well flagged as pan-European share platforms - Cboe and London Stock Exchange\u2019s Turquoise in London - began preparing to open in the Amsterdam after Britain voted in 2016 to leave the EU.

There are currently 13 U.S. stock exchanges, including five run by NYSE-owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc, four owned by Cboe Global Markets Inc, and three by Nasdaq Inc. IEX Group runs the only independent U.S. stock exchange.  There are also two other exchanges eying 2020 launches: The Long Term Stock Exchange (LTSE), a Silicon Valley-based startup aimed at promoting long-term corporate growth ahead of short-term profits; and the Members Exchange (MEMX), a low-cost bourse backed by a group of large financial firms. The LTSE was granted regulatory approval in May, while MEMX, and now MIAX, await SEC decisions on their plans.  The proliferation of exchanges has caused some brokers to complain that the new bourses add little to the market, while increasing complexity, and adding to connectivity and market data costs.  Princeton New Jersey-based MIAX has offices in Miami and has said it aims to eventually list companies from Latin America on its stock exchange. In the meantime, the company said it will compete on price, a strategy that has helped it gain a more than 10% market share in equity options across its three exchanges.  In September, Thomas Gallagher, the chief executive officer of MIAX\u2019s parent company, said Pearl Equities, would start out 40% cheaper than the incumbent exchanges on execution fees.  \u201cWhen you make a movie that does well, you do it again and you do it again and you do it again,\u201d he said.

FILE PHOTO: Jay Clayton, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, speaks during an interview with CNBC at the Sandler O'Neill + Partners Global Exchange and Brokerage Conference in New York, U.S., June 6, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Under the current system, Wall Street banks and other massive traders get hefty rebates based on how much business they funnel to exchanges. The result of this complex and often opaque system is that big users can end up trading for free, or even get paid to trade, while small brokers pay substantial fees.  Most exchange operators, including New York Stock Exchange-owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc, Nasdaq Inc and Cboe Global Markets, have embraced the system in at least some of their exchanges to help boost volumes and fatten their bottom lines.  While the SEC has not launched a formal civil investigation, it is seeking information from the exchanges on the pricing system. If the SEC were to determine that the tiered structure is unfair, exchanges could be forced to simplify their pricing models, potentially costing them millions of dollars in fees.  SEC spokeswoman Judith Burns declined to comment. NYSE and Nasdaq declined to comment on the SEC probe into multi-tiered pricing.  Cboe said it offers different types of pricing tiers catering to all of its clients and that the tiers are the result of years of intense competition among exchanges.  \u201cAt this point, we do not have plans to change our pricing schedules,\u201d said Bryan Harkins, who co-heads Cboe\u2019s markets division.  More generally, exchanges say that fierce competition in the industry has resulted in tighter bid-ask spreads that benefit all investors.  The regulatory scrutiny is part of a broader effort by the SEC under Chairman Jay Clayton to improve transparency around exchange pricing and ensure it is fair and equitable as required under the Exchange Act.  \u201cThe SEC has thrown the gauntlet down,\u201d said Chester Spatt, a finance professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a former chief economist at SEC. Tiered pricing will likely emerge as a central issue in the debate, said Spatt, who has a working paper on the topic.  The regulator has also ordered exchanges to justify recent fee hikes for market data, and has mandated a pilot program to test banning rebate payments that exchanges make to brokers for liquidity-adding stock orders.  ICE, Nasdaq and Cboe have filed lawsuits or appeals challenging the SEC\u2019s authority on those two mandates.  Tackling U.S. exchanges is one of the few areas where Republicans and Democrats agree. Republicans believe the current rules are anti-competitive, while Democrats worry existing exchange structures and incentives could hurt small and large investors.  (For graphic comparing number of small brokers to mid- and large-sized brokers, see: tmsnrt.rs\/2VKfgCw)  HARD TO COMPETE  Tensions between Wall Street and the exchanges, which were once member-owned, not-for-profit utilities, have risen over the past decade and a half as the bourses have become public companies.  Some brokers say the exchanges have used their essential position in the market to maximize profits, often to the detriment of smaller brokers.  Joe Wald, chief executive of brokerage Clearpool Group, said tiered pricing makes it harder for smaller brokers to compete for customer orders against bigger firms, which get significant discounts on trading costs.  \u201cIt discriminates against smaller broker dealers who end up almost perversely subsidizing the cost of the whole exchange relationship for the largest firms,\u201d he said.  Clearpool executes more than 2 percent of U.S. stock trades on an average day, but comes nowhere near hitting the higher-volume exchange tiers, which allow the biggest brokers to reap rebates nearly 60 percent higher than those that qualify for base rates, Wald said.  When factoring in rebate payments from the exchanges, five of the top 10 customers at both Nasdaq and Cboe by volume actually receive checks from the exchanges at the end of the month, net of fees, according recent comments by a Cboe executive and a Nasdaq report.  PRICING PATHS  The current fee schedule was approved by the SEC, and exchange pricing lists are publicly available. But they can be dozens of pages long and it is impossible to know which brokers qualify for which tiers.  An analysis by RBC Capital Markets in October found at least 1,023 \u201cpricing paths\u201d across exchanges, made up of 3,762 variables, meaning that there are dozens of possible net prices for execution.  \u201cThese 3,762 variables strongly suggest that exchange prices are tailored and offered on a bespoke basis,\u201d the report said.  Exchanges have credited pricing tiers for helping boost revenues. Bats, an exchange operator that has since been sold to Cboe, said the introduction of tiered pricing for its markets in July 2011 helped increase revenues by $14.6 million over the rest of that year.  Large brokers, which include investment banks and high-frequency trading firms, can also profit from tiered pricing by offering smaller brokers that funnel their orders through them a portion of their steeper discounts, while keeping the remainder.  Cboe\u2019s Harkins said that this \u201csponsored access\u201d allows smaller firms to share in the savings with big brokers.","24":"(Repeats for wider distribution)  NEW YORK, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Hard pressed to quash allegations that its popular \u201cfear gauge\u201d is being manipulated, Cboe Global Markets is turning to artificial intelligence to help put those concerns to rest.  The exchange, which owns the lucrative volatility index the VIX, has taken several steps to confront manipulation claims that have helped drive the Cboe\u2019s stock down about 15 percent this year, putting it on pace for its worst year ever.  In its latest effort to police trading tied to the index, the Cboe is working with FINRA, its regulatory services provider, to develop machine learning techniques to tell whether market conditions surrounding the VIX settlement are potentially anomalous, the exchange told Reuters.  \u201cIncorporating the use of machine learning and AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a logical part of the ongoing enhancement of our overall regulatory program,\u201d Greg Hoogasian, Cboe chief regulatory officer, said in an emailed statement.  Cboe declined to elaborate on when it began using machine learning techniques to monitor VIX settlements.  Any steps, however, may take a while to change investors\u2019 minds on the stock.  \u201cAny time you see controversy over manipulating markets and it involves a company, there are people who will walk away from the stock,\u201d said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.  \u201cIt ends up tarnishing the company and subjecting them to legal risk that is very hard to quantify,\u201d he said.  Tuz said Chase Investment Counsel, which owned nearly 19,000 Cboe shares in mid-2017, began selling its stake early this year, shedding the last of it on May 21.  Cboe\u2019s stock performance this year has lagged that of other major exchange operators. Shares of Nasdaq Inc are up about 17 percent, Intercontinental Exchange Inc\u2019s is up about 10 percent and CME Group Inc shares have risen 18 percent.  Concerns the index was being manipulated surfaced last year after John Griffin and Amin Shams of the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas, Austin wrote an academic paper that noted significant spikes in trading volume in S&P 500 index options right at the time of settlement.  The paper also compared the value of the VIX at settlement with its value as calculated from S&P 500 options right after the settlement, and showed the two tend to diverge.  Instances of big deviations are taken as evidence by some that unscrupulous traders have been deliberately moving the settlement price.  A stock market fall on Feb. 5 that caused the VIX to surge the most in its 25-year history brought further scrutiny to the index, and led to dozens of lawsuits and ongoing probes into the matter by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  The regulators have yet to comment on the matter and Cboe has denied the manipulation accusations, citing liquidity problems and legitimate hedging activity as reasons for unusual moves on settlement days.  \u201cOnly a forensic analysis of those episodes can confirm or refute such a claim,\u201d said Kambiz Kazemi, partner at Canadian investment management firm La Financi\u00e8re Constance.  Meanwhile, the steps Cboe has taken to address the claims of manipulation are going in the right direction, said Kazemi.  The exchange operator recently overhauled the technology behind the auctions, improved the speed with which it sends alerts about auction imbalances, and sought to increase the number of market makers that provide buy and sell quotes for the auction.  POLICING THE FEAR GAUGE  Orderly VIX settlement auctions over the last few months have helped take some of the pressure off the Chicago-based exchange operator.  \u201cI think we all will be observing the effects of the Cboe measures in the next few months,\u201d Kazemi said.  VIX and associated products accounted for roughly a quarter of Cboe\u2019s 2017 earnings, analysts estimate, and the controversy around the product has spooked some stockholders.  While financial firms have been using artificial intelligence software for everything from compliance to stock-picking, a growing number of firms have started to use it for market oversight.  Given the huge amount of data involved in market surveillance, machine learning algorithms can be far more efficient than humans in rooting out potential market manipulation, said Richard Johnson, a market structure and technology consultant at Greenwich Associates.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a must have,\u201d he said.  FINRA, which already monitors Cboe\u2019s market on the company\u2019s behalf, confirmed it was working on machine learning to enhance surveillance of the VIX settlement auctions, but would not offer specifics.  More generally, the Wall Street watchdog is working to use artificial intelligence to catch nefarious activities more quickly, including schemes that may have previously been unknown to regulators, said Tom Gira, who oversees FINRA\u2019s market regulation department.  He said FINRA has begun using machine learning to scan for illegal activities across stock and options exchanges and is in the process of adding a feedback loop to the software that would regularly incorporate analysts\u2019 data and allow the machines to detect ever-changing manipulation patterns.","25":"FILE PHOTO: Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority Andrew Bailey speaks at a press conference at the Bank of England in London, Britain February 25, 2019.

REUTERS\/John Sibley  Markus Ferber, a senior member of the European Parliament, called on the European Securities and Markets Authority to introduce a pan-EU ban on short-selling.  \u201cESMA\u2019s mandate is to safeguard market stability and integrity,\u201d Ferber said in a letter to ESMA\u2019s chair Steven Maijoor.  \u201cHence, ESMA would be well-advised to make use of its emergency powers and introduce a temporary ban on short selling.\u201d  Some European and U.S. policymakers have suggested more radical action such as temporarily closing markets or shortening the trading day to calm nerves. Leading exchanges in Europe and the United States dismissed these options on Tuesday.  To trigger ESMA\u2019s emergency market powers, ESMA, the European Commission or the European Systemic Risk Board, would need to conclude there is an emergency.  They would then need an endorsement from EU Council of member states to tap the emergency powers.  ESMA declined to say if it was seeking to use its emergency powers. Market infrastructure like exchanges and clearing houses were holding up well, it said.  The ESRB, an offshoot of the European Central Bank, had no immediate comment.  The European Commission said it was closely monitoring the impact of the epidemic on the real economy and on financial markets.  \u201cWe are in close contact with supervisory authorities. We have a full range of tools and rules in place to ensure the resilience of financial market actors,\u201d a commission spokesman said.  ESMA could introduce a temporary pan-EU short-selling ban under its emergency powers.  The EU watchdog could not on its own shut down securities markets or shorten the trading day as that would have be done by national watchdogs.  The EU Council could, however, order specific actions that ESMA - or the EU\u2019s banking or insurance watchdogs - would then coordinate across the bloc.  So far only four of the 27 EU states, France, Italy, Belgium and Spain, have introduced national curbs on short-selling while other countries in the bloc have held back.  Ferber, a senior German center-right member of parliament\u2019s economic affairs committee, said that potentially, the downward volatility being seen is substantially increased by short-sellers.  \u201cSuch a ban should be introduced on a European level and in a coordinated way in order to avoid market fragmentation and regulatory arbitrage,\u201d Ferber said.  Earlier this week ESMA lowered the threshold for short-sellers to report their positions to regulators in a bid to give earlier notice, saying it was a preliminary step to possible further action.","27":"LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union\u2019s markets watchdog published guidance on Tuesday identifying which shares investors in the bloc could no longer trade in London if there is a hard Brexit next week.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The move drew instant criticism from Britain\u2019s financial regulator, saying it risked disrupting markets.  Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29, but it has yet to agree a divorce settlement and \u201cstandstill\u201d transition deal with the bloc. The UK is now expected to ask for a delay to Brexit.  The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published a list of 6,200 shares subject to the bloc\u2019s \u201ctrading obligation\u201d. This means they would have to be bought and sold on a platform based in the EU if Britain left the bloc without a deal.  It includes 14 shares listed in London but deemed to have enough trading \u201cliquidity\u201d on EU exchanges. EU investors could continue to buy and sell in London shares that are not on ESMA\u2019s list.  Without ESMA\u2019s guidance, EU investors could only trade shares listed on an EU exchange in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  ESMA said it was seeking to limit potential market disruption.  \u201cESMA wishes to highlight that the guidance provided in the public statement should only be applied in case of a no-deal Brexit occurring on 29 March 2019,\u201d the watchdog said.  \u201cShould the timing and conditions of Brexit change, ESMA may adjust its approach and inform the public of any changes as soon as possible.\u201d  Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority said ESMA\u2019s guidance meant that EU banks, funds and asset managers will not be able to trade some UK or EU shares in London, even where the UK is the home listing of the British or EU company.  It called for a comprehensive and coordinated approach to avoid potential disruption to market participants.  \u201cWe therefore urge further dialogue on this issue in order to minimise risks of disruption in the interests of orderly markets,\u201d the FCA said in a statement.  ESMA said it is mindful of the impact of a no-deal Brexit on EU market structures.  \u201cTherefore, ESMA will consider, in light of possible market developments, whether to review its approach at the latest 12 months after the no-deal Brexit date,\u201d ESMA said.","28":"FILE PHOTO: Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Global Markets sign hangs at its headquarters building in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., September 19, 2018.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of stock market operator Euronext is seen on a building in the financial district of la Defense in Courbevoie, near Paris, France, May 14, 2018. REUTERS\/Charles Platiau  The outage is at least the fifth major one globally this year and one of the most widespread as exchange operator Euronext hosts stocks exchanges from Dublin and Amsterdam to Paris and Lisbon.  Trading in those locations came to standstill for more than three hours on Monday morning due to a technical failure impacting one of its data management systems. Though it was resolved in the afternoon, it came back during closing auctions.  \u201cThere is a concentration risk given how these platforms host multiple bourses,\u201d said Anish Puaar, a market structure analyst at Rosenblatt. Euronext and Deutsche Boerse host several stock exchanges across Europe.  Euronext operates six major stock markets in Europe. While trading of stocks can also be done on other platforms such as Cboe Europe, Aquis and Turquoise, they generally use Euronext as the reference market.  The initial glitch caused one major liquidity provider to pull quotes from Euronext\u2019s exchanges for the rest of the day, said an executive at the firm who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.  The quotes were pulled because in order to account for the risk of continuing to trade on Euronext exchanges, the liquidity provider would have had to widen out its bid-ask spreads to a point where its prices would have been prohibitive to trade against, the person said.  The issues encountered on Monday were not due to a problem in Euronext\u2019s proprietary platform but \u201ca bug in a third-party component\u201d, the exchange operator said in a emailed statement to Reuters.  While the problems looked to have been resolved on Tuesday, the outage will be embarrassing for Euronext which is planning a major expansion through a 4.3 billion euro ($5.07 billion) deal to buy Borsa Italiana from London Stock Exchange.  Euronext will operate exchanges with more than 1,800 listed companies and an aggregate market value of around 4.4 trillion euros after the Borsa Italiana deal.  \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is markets handled record volumes in March-April without any issues,\u201d Puaar said.  \u201cIt\u2019s kind of ironic to see these issues now that things have calmed down a bit,\u201d he said, highlighting that European volumes surged to more 100 billion euros a day in March but are generally less than half that now.  There have been a string of breakdowns this year on international exchanges, including a hardware failure at the Tokyo Stock Exchange, cyber attacks that hit New Zealand\u2019s stock exchange, and a software glitch at Germany\u2019s electronic trading platform Xetra, managed by Deutsche Boerse.  LAST FIVE MINUTES  The problems at market close on Monday may been particularly problematic as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and hedge funds typically use prices set during closing auctions for their daily pricing, making the final five minutes of trade crucial.  There were major price swings during the crucial closing auctions on Monday, prompting the exchange to cancel all orders placed after 1730 Central European Time (CET).  \u201cA bunch of cancelled prints, so all the admin of reconciling, then reporting back to clients, and amending everything etc. So lots of manual effort,\u201d said a senior London-based trader, who processes trades for hedge funds.  Euronext said the root cause of the issue was a technical failure impacting one of its data management systems, denying any possibility of there being a cyberattack.  \u201cActions have been taken to secure a similar issue does not happen going forward,\u201d it added.  France\u2019s financial regulator last year warned in a report that the rising significance of closing auctions \u201cis accompanied by the emergence of certain risks, in particular an increased exposure to operational incidents, which could occur during this very brief phase\u201d.  France\u2019s AMF and its Portuguese counterpart CMVM said they were in touch with Euronext and its supervisors about the incident to evaluate the quality of corrective and preventive measures.  The glitches caused the share price of Dutch healthcare technology company Philips to fall almost 4% at Monday\u2019s close to less than 40 euros. The company later said it was informed by Euronext that their closing price would actually be set at 42.3 euros.  A Euronext spokesman declined to comment on the value of trade orders cancelled on Monday\u2019s close. Closing auctions across Europe\u2019s major bourses have on average accounted for a fifth of daily average volumes, analysts say.

The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) banking lobby and the Investment Association (IA), which represent asset managers, said in a statement the London Stock Exchange trading day should be cut by 90 minutes to seven hours.  They proposed two options, for the day to run between 0900 and 1600 UK time, or from 0930 to 1630 UK time.  \u201cAFME and the IA would also support a 12-month pilot across all major European exchanges and trading venues in order to test market structure benefits and impacts,\u201d they added.  It is unclear if all of Europe\u2019s main bourses would agree to cutting trading hours, given concerns that business could end up moving to Asia or the United States, with which their existing hours overlap.  AFME and the IA made the proposal in their formal response to a public consultation by the LSE on cutting trading hours.  Shortening the trading day from 8.5 hours would mean trades being more evenly distributed to cut costs for investors, which rise when liquidity is thin, and prevent transactions bunching up in the last 2.5 hours, the trade bodies said.  \u201cFor comparison, the U.S. market has shorter trading hours but six times the turnover, with an overall much lower cost of trading across the day, demonstrating greater stability in liquidity conditions across the whole trading day.\u201d  The Japanese market is open for six hours, but with a one-hour lunch break.  Cboe Europe, the region\u2019s biggest cross-border share trading platform, said it would make sense to start later as the start of the session does not overlap with Wall Street.  AFME said adjusting market hours is a first step towards further improving diversity in the financial sector, AFME.  Trading remains one of the areas of financial services where staff face significant mental health issues, with excessively long hours contributing to the problem, AFME and IA said.

FILE PHOTO: Canary Wharf and the city are seen at sunset in London, December 14, 2016. REUTERS\/Eddie Keogh  Few expect London to lose its position as Europe\u2019s biggest financial hub, but Britain\u2019s departure from the EU is turning into a multibillion-euro boost for the bloc\u2019s protracted efforts to build a deeper capital market to rival the UK capital.  Britain\u2019s parliament is due to vote on Tuesday on a divorce settlement with the EU that includes a \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d transition period from March 29 to the end of 2020.  Three weeks away from Brexit Day, it is unclear whether a deal will pass, whether Brexit will be delayed, or whether Britain will leave with no agreement at all.  But whatever happens, a fundamental change in European markets is underway.  \u201cThe ship has sailed and market infrastructure has changed with people having made their decision, taken premises, hired staff and doing all the testing,\u201d said Steve Grob, head of marketing at trading technology firm ION Markets.  Dutch regulatory approval is imminent for trading in euro government bond and repurchase agreements at U.S. exchange CME\u2019s new Amsterdam hub to begin on March 18, the company said.  U.S. exchange Cboe also expects the regulatory green light imminently to shift euro denominated share trading from London to its new unit in the Dutch capital for April 1.  Trading platforms, essentially a heavily-regulated grouping of computer servers, are not major employers and therefore the number of jobs leaving London will not be large.  But a shift in trading could act as a magnet that drags other business like clearing and listings across the English Channel, Grob said.  Chunks of trading assets have already gone ahead.  The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) estimated in a 2017 report that lenders held 1.1 trillion euros ($1.2 trillion) of derivatives, stocks and bonds on their trading books in London on behalf of customers in the 27 states that will remain in the EU.  Consultancy EY said that 800 billion euros of assets had shifted from London to new banking hubs in the EU.  For the bulk of the money, the shift is expected to be permanent because the European Central Bank, the main supervisor of EU hubs, has made locating significant amounts of euro business in the bloc a condition in new licenses, bankers said.  Exchange officials also don\u2019t want to split trading in euro securities between the EU and London, which would create two, less efficient pools of liquidity.  \u201cAt the moment it\u2019s incremental steps but with every week and month, it will add up to a lot and it\u2019s one way,\u201d said Rob Boardman, head of European equities at broker ITG.  \u201cI\u2019ve not heard of EU trading platforms suddenly deciding they want to open a hub in the UK.\u201d  DUTCH SENSE  Brexit and competition to attract trading activity from London is pitting Amsterdam against Paris for the mantle of EU capital markets leader from a departing Britain.  Amsterdam, home to the world\u2019s first stock exchange and a trading nation for as long as Britain, is culturally aligned with the City of London financial district, Grob said.  Euro repo trading alone at the CME\u2019s new unit in Amsterdam will total about 200 billion euros a day.  \u201cIt made natural sense for us to go there,\u201d CME Chairman and Chief Executive Terry Duffy said.  Egged on by customers, LCH, a unit of the London Stock Exchange (LSE), has already moved clearing in euro repo trades totaling nearly 780 billion euros a day from London to its established Paris arm in a sign of how clearing is shifting too.  Cboe Europe, which accounts for over a fifth of daily pan-European share trading or 8 billion euros, will trade all European Economic Area listed stocks in Amsterdam from April 1.  Smaller rival Aquis Exchange, representing about 4 percent of pan-European stocks trading, intends to trade all its euro business in a new unit in Paris.  Interdealer broker TP ICAP is also opening an EU hub in Paris, and its iSwap fixed income business is setting up in Amsterdam. MarketAxess has a new hub in Amsterdam too, to trade credit in parallel with its London unit.  The LSE\u2019s Turquoise pan-European share trading platform, which has about 7 percent of the market, is opening an Amsterdam hub but will continue trading euro stocks in London if there is a Brexit deal, though much could hinge on where customers want to trade.  Britain\u2019s future trading relations with the EU will determine how much euro-denominated trading and clearing will eventually move to the EU, Grob said.  \u2018CITY SUR SEINE\u2019  French banks have mooted a \u201cCity sur Seine\u201d to reduce the EU\u2019s reliance on London and on banks for funding the economy, an ambition that one market veteran called \u201caspirational\u201d given investors\u2019 suspicion of France\u2019s tradition of interventionism.  But Arnaud de Bresson, head of Paris Europlace, which promotes the French capital as a financial center, said that while Paris would contribute \u201cenergetically\u201d to EU financial reform, it was also attuned to the needs of markets.  \u201cParis is already, after London, the top financial center in Europe for capital market activity. We are very close to the capital market culture,\u201d de Bresson said.  Banks also want Brussels to beef up efforts to build a deeper EU capital market as they face pressure from regulators to build up activity in their new hubs in the bloc.  \u201cIn light of Brexit, the CMU (capital markets union) project is more vital than ever for the EU to enhance and integrate its capital markets capacity and infrastructure,\u201d said Rick Watson, head of capital markets at AFME.","34":"LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - The European Union\u2019s markets watchdog published guidance on Tuesday that would allow investors to continue trading shares in London for a temporary period in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Its agreed acquisition of NEX Exchange, which Aquis will use to enter the listings market, is expected to obtain UK regulatory approval later this year.  Aquis accounts for 4.8% of European share trading, and Liberum analysts said on Tuesday they expect this to reach 10%. Haynes said that once Brexit uncertainty has ended, Aquis should flourish as investors return.  BREXIT FIRST MOVER  Aquis and rivals CBOE and Turquoise trade shares listed on national exchanges.  CBOE will offer trading in shares from all EU countries, apart from Britain, on its new Amsterdam platform on Oct. 1 regardless of what form Brexit takes later that month.  It means that European share trading will fragment, reversing years of efforts by the EU to create a seamless cross-border market that is cheaper and more efficient for investors to compete better with the United States for raising funds for companies to grow.  CBOE already accounts for about a fifth of share trading in EU shares, and Haynes said he was not worried that the U.S. rival will gain first mover advantage.  \u201cI don\u2019t think any real trading is going to take place until there is a no-deal Brexit. The real test will be on November 1, post-Brexit in a no-deal scenario,\u201d Haynes said.  Turquoise has not announced the start of trading in the Dutch financial capital.  Share trading is not the only financial activity leaving London to nibble away at the capital\u2019s role as a global financial centre.  In March CME moved about 230 billion euros of daily trading in euro-denominated repurchase agreements and government debt from London to a new hub in Amsterdam, with clearing of those contracts shifted from London to Paris.  The London Stock Exchange has moved trading in euro zone government bonds from London to Milan.  But figures this week from the Bank for International Settlements showed that since Britain voted in 2016 to leave the EU, London has remained the world\u2019s biggest currency trading centre, and has overtaken New York to become the biggest centre for trading interest rate derivatives.","38":"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union has created an unprecedented sense of urgency for \u201cfull and unwavering\u201d political backing to integrate the EU\u2019s capital market, a report said on Thursday.  The EU began its capital markets union (CMU) project in 2015 to increase the role of stock and bond markets in funding companies and reduce their reliance on bank loans.  Despite new laws and a reboot, results have been patchy and Brexit was a reminder of how much the EU relies on London, Europe\u2019s biggest financial centre.  A task force set up by the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, said in a report on Thursday that completing the CMU would provide a full range of financial products, services and infrastructure for its economy.  \u201cThe European Union is in the process of seeing some of its market infrastructure moving off-shore,\u201d the report said.  LCH, a unit of the London Stock Exchange LSE.L, clears the bulk of euro-denominated interest rate swaps, but will need EU access after December when a \"standstill\" transition period ends.  Britain left the EU last month and Brussels is now assessing how much access it will give to UK-based financial firms like banks, asset managers, insurers and market infrastructure firms like clearing houses and trading platforms.  A senior adviser to the EU in the trade talks with Britain said on Wednesday that the need to deepen the bloc\u2019s capital market will be a factor in the assessments.  The report said that capital markets in the 27 countries of the EU have become more integrated than in the past.  \u201cHowever, they still do not function as one, and their main centre, London, is now outside the EU,\u201d the report said.  The task force, known at the high level forum on the capital markets union, will publish specific recommendations in May.  They are likely to include addressing tax barriers, improving volumes in secondary securities markets, and better integration in securities trading and post-trading, a sector that includes clearing.  The report said EU states must go beyond verbal support for CMU and back targeted action with a clear timetable.  \u201cFor the completion of the CMU, it is now essential to target the measures that may be politically difficult, but that will lead to tangible results,\u201d report said.  Michael Cole-Fontayn, chairman of AFME, a European banking and markets lobby, said it was vital to have ambitious recommendations for the next phase of CMU.","39":"Feb 20 (Reuters) - The Members Exchange (MEMX), a new would-be bourse backed by major Wall Street firms, said on Thursday it plans to launch the exchange on July 24 following the closure of a funding round led by JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Jane Street Capital.  The company did not disclose the amount raised or the valuation at which the funding was made.  MEMX will start onboarding trading members later in February, it said in a statement.  In a blog post, MEMX said it expects to receive approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the second quarter and will begin platform testing and member certification on May 11.  When MEMX was first announced in January 2019, it pushed down the share prices of exchange operators Nasdaq and NYSE parent Intercontinental Exchange Inc.  The institutions that fund and control MEMX are some of the biggest customers of major U.S. exchanges, including Bank of America Corp, Virtu Financial, Morgan Stanley , Fidelity and Citadel Securities.  Online retail brokers Charles Schwab Corp and E*Trade Financial Corp are also founding members.  This is not the first time that industry giants have taken on established exchanges.  Nearly a decade ago, a group of banks backed a low-cost exchange called BATS. Another group of industry heavyweights launched an exchange called Direct Edge with a similar goal of slashing trading costs.  The two exchanges quickly gained market share, later merged and are now owned by Cboe Global Markets. (Reporting by Abhishek Manikandan in Bengaluru; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu)","40":"LONDON (Reuters) - Direct access for Britain\u2019s financial sector to the European Union after Brexit is increasingly under threat as political will for an industry deal fades and the bloc toughens requirements for recognizing other countries\u2019 financial rules.  FILE PHOTO: A general view of The Shard and the financial district is seen in London, Britain, May 7, 2019. REUTERS\/Hannah McKay\/File Photo  The EU is the City\u2019s biggest customer, with financial services exports worth 26 billion pounds in 2017. Ensuring the UK\u2019s large financial industry could still operate across the bloc from its home base was one of the central issues during early divorce talks after Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016.  But as the EU and Britain quashed the industry\u2019s hopes of largely unfettered access to the bloc, banks began moving around a trillion pounds of assets from London to new EU hubs, while trading worth around 240 billion euros a day in euro zone government bonds has moved to Milan and Amsterdam.  Despite the preparations, maintaining direct access would mean the sector could continue to leverage cross-border efficiencies of scale and avoid passing on the costs to customers of maintaining two hubs, one in Britain, the other in the EU.  Any access would be through \u201cequivalence\u201d - whereby the EU deems Britain\u2019s rules to be aligned closely enough to its own - but Brexit has already prompted Brussels to toughen up equivalence conditions.  \u201cYou can ask for whatever you like in equivalence, but the chance of the EU going down that line is zero until they decide they need it,\u201d said Sharon Bowles, a former chair of the European Parliament\u2019s economic affairs committee.  Equivalence is used by firms much further afield in the United States, Singapore and Japan, but was never designed for a whole global financial center on the EU\u2019s doorstep and does not cover core financial activities like banking.  The preparations already undertaken by financial institutions in the wake of the political impasse have to some degree lessened the need for alignment and some are keen to break free of what they consider restrictive rules.  UK insurance firms, for example, have long complained that EU capital rules are too inflexible, but despite pressure from lawmakers, the Bank of England has been loathe to make any unilateral changes while in the bloc.  \u201cI think that City opinion is more divided than a year ago on the merits of equivalence because of the reality of what it will look like in practice,\u201d said Jonathan Herbst, global head of financial services at Norton Rose Fulbright law firm.  Given that any EU-UK trade deal would likely be based on a series of compromises across all sectors, like fishing rights and autos, a divided but well resourced financial sector may give Britain\u2019s finance ministry less incentive to push for equivalence-based access to EU capital markets.  GOLDEN THREAD  Brussels has said it will grant temporary equivalence for the London Stock Exchange's LSE.L unit LCH to continue clearing euro derivatives until March next year to avoid disruption if there is a no-deal Brexit in October, something seen as more likely under Boris Johnson, who becomes Britain's Prime Minster on Wednesday.  That has helped London to retain the bulk of euro clearing, ironically the main thing that EU politicians said they wanted moved out of Britain after Brexit.  But it is unclear if that will be for the long term, or if there will be equivalence for investment services like trading stocks and bonds, which are regulated by EU MiFID securities rules.  \u201cInvestment services under MiFID is the golden thread that would allow you to keep sales in London,\u201d a fund industry official said.  The EU\u2019s markets watchdog has ruled that under a no-deal Brexit, euro shares must be traded inside the bloc, a signal that Brussels may want to deepen its own capital markets union by being tougher in granting equivalence.  Three UK-based pan-European platforms in London, Aquis AQX.L, Turquoise and Cboe CBOE.Z have already opened hubs in Amsterdam and Paris for EU customers to trade shares listed on other exchanges.  A hard Brexit would damage the prospects for equivalence by eroding goodwill in Brussels, said Nicolas Mackel, head of Luxembourg for Finance.  It could even prompt the bloc to review its temporary reprieve for euro clearing.  \u201cThe EU might very well decide that past derivatives inventories stay where they are, but mandate the clearing of all new business to the EU,\u201d said Xavier Rolet, former London Stock Exchange chief executive and now head of fund management firm CQS.  The decision by the EU to allow equivalence for the Swiss stock exchange to lapse last month showed markets can adapt to major changes without disruption, added Christian Voigt, senior regulatory advisor at trading software company Fidessa.  \u201cIt would be a step back for the City and increase costs for users, but it would not kill the industry,\u201d Voigt said.  It would be hard for the EU to suddenly cut off London when it comes to bond underwriting for companies and governments, said Simon Gleeson, a financial lawyer at Clifford Chance.  PIE IN THE SKY  The Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority of Britain have warned Britain must not become a permanent \u201ctaker\u201d of EU rules to obtain market access, tying the hands of UK regulators, a sentiment share by the government.  To mitigate this risk, Britain has called for the EU\u2019s equivalence system to be \u201cenhanced\u201d or made more transparent and predictable to make it more acceptable.  Bowles said it was \u201cpie in the sky\u201d to expect the EU to radically reform equivalence to Britain\u2019s liking in the short term.  In a reminder to London of what\u2019s at stake, the European Commission is due to announce that it has scrapped equivalence based access for the first time because countries refused to keep up with EU rules.  \u201cIt is going to be difficult not to be closely aligned with EU rules,\u201d said David Wright, the former top civil servant for financial services at the European Commission and now with Flint Global consultants.","41":"LONDON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - The European Union\u2019s executive European Commission set out 16 measures on Thursday to deepen the bloc\u2019s capital market over five years.  The measures are:  * Creating a \u201cEuropean single access point\u201d to provide financial information on companies to the public;  * Assessing if listing rules for small companies could be further simplified;  * Review of EU rules for long-term investment funds or ELTIFs to make them more attractive;  * Review of capital rules for insurers and banks to encourage investment in long-term projects;  * Analyse feasibility of requiring banks to direct small companies, whose loan application they have rejected, to alternative providers of funding;  * Review of securitisation rules for possible amendments to help banks lend more;  * Assessment of how to improve the public\u2019s knowledge and understanding of finance;  * Build up retail investor trust, potentially by requiring financial advisers to obtain a certificate that proves their level of knowledge;  * Develop best practices in pension auto-enrolment to get more people to save for their retirement;  * Introduce a common, standardised EU-wide system for withholding tax to cut red tape for cross-border investors;  * Harmonise or increased convergence in insolvency rules;  * Making it easier for shareholders to engage with companies, including how they can vote;  * Streamline cross-border settlement of financial transactions;  * Create a \u201cconsolidated tape\u201d or record of stock trades to give investors a single snapshot of best market prices for share and equity like instruments;  * Stronger and better enforced investor protection;  * Enhance single rulebook for capital markets, assess need to further harmonise rules, and monitor progress towards convergence in market supervision and learn regulatory lessons from collapse of German payments company Wirecard.","42":"BRUSSELS\/ZURICH (Reuters) - The European Commission and Switzerland both refused to blink on Wednesday in a standoff over a stalled partnership treaty that threatens to trigger stock trading curbs across Europe from Monday.  FILE PHOTO: A man walks under the illuminated word \"Borse\" (exchange) as he passes the headquarters of Swiss stock exchange operator SIX Group in Zurich, Switzerland November 20, 2017. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann\/File Photo  Barring an improbable last-minute breakthrough, EU-based banks and brokers will be prevented from trading shares directly on Swiss bourses from July 1. They usually generate more than half the turnover on Swiss stock markets.  The Swiss have vowed to retaliate with a decree forcing all Swiss shares to be traded on domestic exchanges by banning EU bourses from hosting Swiss equities trading.  In Brussels, the Commission said it has had no contact with Switzerland in the past few days on avoiding the expiration at the end of this week of the regime which allows Swiss stock exchanges to access the European Union market.  \u201cThere have not been any contact,\u201d the EU executive\u2019s spokeswoman told a news conference. She said there was no update from last week\u2019s meeting of the EU Commission that refrained from proposing an extension to the so-called equivalence regime.  Under EU rules, the EU executive had to decide by June 21 on whether to propose an extension of the equivalence regime. It did not make any proposal by that deadline. As a consequence the preferential regime will automatically expire on June 30.  In Bern, a government spokesman said the cabinet had not discussed the Europe dossier at its weekly meeting.  \u201cIf (stock market regulation) equivalence is not given then Plan B will be activated -- protective measures for the Swiss exchanges -- and that will simply be activated at the end of this month,\u201d he told reporters after the meeting.  Brussels linked the extension to progress on a general partnership treaty, which was agreed in November after years of negotiations but has not yet been endorsed by Bern because of fears over its impact on Swiss labor laws and other issues.  Last week the commission said there was no progress on the partnership treaty. The spokeswoman repeated on Wednesday that the situation had not changed.  She added, however, that Brussels remained open to finalize the overall partnership treaty with Bern by the end of October, when the mandate of the current commission ends.","43":"(Reuters) - Cboe Global Markets Inc CBOE.Z on Friday launched a service aimed at wooing retail stock orders, as the exchange operator posted better-than-expected third-quarter results, boosted by higher trading volume in its proprietary products.  Cboe owns the rights to products such as S&P 500 index options and derivatives linked to the VIX volatility index, Wall Street\u2019s so-called \u201cfear gauge.\u201d They helped drive Cboe\u2019s options trading volumes up about 15% in the quarter from a year earlier, and futures trading volumes up nearly 17%.  Cboe also runs four of the 13 U.S. stock exchanges currently operating. In that hyper-competitive environment, the Chicago-based company\u2019s U.S. equities market share slipped to 17.2% from 17.5% a year earlier, though it was up from 15.7% a quarter ago.  \u201cWe were very clear that we were not happy with the market share where we were,\u201d Cboe Chief Financial Officer Brian Schell said on a call with analysts, referring to prior quarters.  To attract more volume, Cboe lowered some of its pricing, taking a longer-term view that higher volumes increase the value of its market data and other services, he said.  Competition is also heating up. A new yet-to-open exchange gained regulatory approval in May, and the application for another, backed by a consortium of big financial institutions seeking to lower trading costs, was published on Thursday.  To attract more volume, Cboe on Friday launched an order type on one of its exchanges that gives retail orders priority over other orders, which Cboe said will improve execution times.  Retail orders make up around 20% of U.S. stock orders, but most are bought by so-called wholesale brokers, such as Virtu Financial Inc VIRT.O and Citadel Securities, which pay slightly more than the best market price and try to profit off the bid-offer spread.  Exchanges vie for the remaining orders.  Many retail brokers, such as TD Ameritrade AMTD.O, E*Trade Financial Corp ETFC.O, and Charles Schwab Corp SCHW.N, recently eliminated trading fees in a fight for customers.  That increases the importance of getting quality executions for those customers, which Cboe hopes to cash in on.  Cboe\u2019s quarterly net income rose to $105.5 million, or 94 cents per share, from $85 million, or 76 cents per share, a year earlier.  Stripping out one-time items, Cboe earned $1.29 per share, 14 cents above analysts expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Revenue rose 8.7% to $294 million.","44":"LONDON (Reuters) - A proposal to shorten trading hours on Europe\u2019s stock exchanges could help to boost liquidity and would have far-reaching benefits for the industry\u2019s hard-working traders.  FILE PHOTO: Traders work at Frankfurt's stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany March 14, 2019. REUTERS\/Ralph Orlowski  But a proposed 90 minute reduction in the trading day could also drive some business away from Europe\u2019s main stock exchanges into so-called dark pools, trading venues which are less transparent and which regulators have been trying to curb.  Banks and fund managers on Thursday have proposed shortening the trading day in Europe to 7 hours from current 8-1\/2 -- one of the longest in the world.  The London Stock Exchange LSE.L, which has said it will consider the proposals, has been operating its FTSE 100 index .FTSE from 0800 London local time to 1630 for the last twenty years.  In 1999, the FTSE started trading one hour earlier to synchronise its trading hours with rest of Europe but Thursday\u2019s proposal recommends a reversal of that.  The new hours would mean a 30 minute reduction in an overlap with the United States\u2019 stock exchanges, which analysts and industry experts believe could be detrimental for the LSE, Europe\u2019s leading stock exchange as well as for its continental European rivals.  \u201cLondon\u2019s great strength is overlapping both the Asian and U.S. trading hours,\u201d said Chris Bailey, European strategist at Raymond James. \u201cI think the current set up is about right.\u201d  But the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), a banking industry body, said the shorter hours would improve liquidity which has been hit by the growth of passive and index-tracking funds.  The popularity of passive investing is draining liquidity in Europe\u2019s $11.1 trillion equities markets as products like exchange-traded funds and hedge funds use end-of-day prices set during the exchanges\u2019 closing auctions for their daily pricing.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  This means the final five minutes of trading has become the busiest time of day for stock market traders with a third of a day\u2019s average trade volume going through in the final hour.  \u201cShortening the hours would concentrate liquidity leading to more consistent trading costs and provide greater time for traders and the market to digest corporate announcements,\u201d AFME and the UK-based Investment Association said.  AFME\u2019s argument on liquidity is largely supported by the industry, but there are also concerns that shorter hours could drive more business into off-market venues known as dark pools.  This would hinder the European markets regulator\u2019s efforts to curb off-market trading, where trades do not contribute to price formation and there is less transparency.  These off-market trading venues have become popular because they can allow large investors to avoid prices moving against them when they execute big stock trades.  \u201cShorter trading hours can drive trading liquidity to off market venues,\u201d Bilal Hafeez, CEO of MacroHive, a macro research and strategy firm based in Britain, said.  \u201cWith market making costs going down thanks to the rise of algorithmic trading and more market moving news such as trade and politics coming outside market hours, shorter trading hours is not ideal.\u201d  In July, trading in such off-market venues accounted for 9.6% of all on-exchange activity, according to data compiled by capital markets advisory firm Tabb Group. This was its highest level since the European Union rules aimed at increasing transparency in financial markets came into effect in Jan. 2018.  Ben Springett, Head of European Electronic and Program Trading at Jefferies, said off-market venues could increase the competitive pressure by opening earlier and closing later than the main markets and that this would be counter-productive.  \u201cThe crucial aspect would be to retain relative harmony across the various European primary exchanges and alternative venues,\u201d Springett said.  For hard-working equity sales traders the cuts would give them some breathing space to prepare for the early morning rush.  \u201cWe all get in earlier than the open. But to have an extra hour to prepare would mean a way less frenetic rush premarket to gather, digest and inform on the news and issues that really matter,\u201d said Mark Taylor, sales trader at Mirabaud, a broker.  The shorter hours could help boost diversity in the industry.  The Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates share trading in Britain, said last month the number of women in senior financial roles had flat-lined since 2005 despite the sector\u2019s \u201crhetoric\u201d on diversity, with broking firms faring worst.  \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone working in this industry could see this move (shorter trading hours) as negative because we all work extra-long hours,\u201d said a female sales trader at a European bank, who declined to be named. \u201cOur day is 11 hours long not eight as they say.\u201d","45":"Nov 1 (Reuters) - Cboe Global Markets Inc:  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS REPORTS RESULTS FOR THIRD QUARTER 2019  * Q3 EARNINGS PER SHARE $0.94  * Q3 REVENUE ROSE 9 PERCENT TO $294 MILLION  * Q3 ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE $1.29  * BOARD INCREASED SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION BY $250 MILLION  * QTRLY TOTAL COMPANY OPTIONS ADV 7,720 MILLION VERSUS 6,733 MILLION  * BOARD INCREASED SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION BY $250 MILLION  * QTRLY FUTURES ADV 279000 VERSUS 239000  * QTRLY OPTIONS NET REVENUE OF $146.5 MILLION, UP 10 PERCENT FROM Q3 OF 2018  * QTRLY FUTURES NET REVENUE OF $38.3 MILLION, UP 28 PERCENT  * Q3 EARNINGS PER SHARE VIEW $1.15, REVENUE VIEW $290.0 MILLION -- REFINITIV IBES DATA Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","46":"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s future access to European Union financial markets is looking increasingly patchy, as Brussels tries to limit the activities which can be carried out from London, prompting more business and jobs to cross the channel.  FILE PHOTO: General view of the Canary Wharf financial district, following the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in London, Britain, May 5, 2020. REUTERS\/Marika Kochiashvili  The City of London\u2019s unfettered access to its biggest customer - worth around 26 billion pounds ($34 billion) annually - ends on Dec. 31 when Brexit transition arrangements expire.  While London is expected to remain Europe\u2019s biggest financial centre with trillion-dollar foreign exchange trading and derivatives clearing staying put for now, recent moves by the EU to limit other trading activities to within the bloc have dashed the finance industry\u2019s hopes of a wider agreement.  Central to the argument is whether Brussels deems UK financial rules \u201cequivalent\u201d or aligned with the EU\u2019s. Britain says this should be straightforward given both sides have the same rules at the outset.  But last month Brussels said it wouldn\u2019t allow banks in London to offer wholesale investment services to EU investors, piling pressure on the City to shift more activity to continental hubs.  \u201cFirms need to carry on doing their \u2018no deal planning\u2019...it will make cross border business outwards from the UK dependent on country by country analysis and so complicated,\u201d said Jonathan Herbst, a financial services lawyer at Norton Rose Fulbright.  ING and BNP Paribas have since announced they will move more trading jobs out of London.  \u201cSelling financial services from the UK to EU clients will not be allowed,\u201d BNP Paribas said last week as it announced it would create 400 new jobs in the EU.  Around 330 financial firms had already relocated some business from Britain to the EU, affecting 5,000 staff by October last year, ahead of a short COVID-19 induced pause, said think tank New Financial.  The Bank of England weighed in on Thursday, warning Brussels\u2019 move risked disruption to cross-border banking and derivatives trading come January, even if equivalence in other areas was agreed.  \u201cThe best that can be expected is a few equivalence agreements by the end of the year,\u201d said Karel Lannoo, CEO of think tank CEPS in Brussels.  WEAPONISATION  Another big unknown is whether EU investors can continue trading EU listed shares on platforms run by Cboe, Turquoise and Aquis in London, rather than on a platform inside the bloc.  All three have opened EU hubs as insurance, with final decisions on equivalence not expected until a wider free trade agreement that includes fisheries and other sensitive sectors is hammered out, something that is likely to drag on until at least October.  Aquis is prepared for the worst case scenario of having to switch trading to its new Paris unit, its head of regulation David Attew said.  The European Commission, which wants to deepen the bloc\u2019s own capital market, said the EU would grant access when it was in its own interests to do so.  The \u201cweaponisation\u201d of equivalence so far was a taster of what\u2019s to come, a UK banking official said. \u201cAre you going to be comfortable with building a business model on that?\u201d  Britain also needs to decide what access EU firms will have to its financial markets.  \u201cFor business coming in, it all depends on how the UK authorities react to a world of what is effectively one way access,\u201d Herbst said.  Britain\u2019s finance ministry has said it is ready to reach comprehensive findings of equivalence as soon as the EU is able to clarify its own position.  But Conor Lawlor, Capital Markets and Brexit Director at banking lobby UK Finance, said lenders should focus on getting \u201cmatch fit\u201d for Britain\u2019s updated regulatory regime, which weaves EU financial rules into UK law, to avoid snarls next January.  \u201cThe industry continues to plan on the basis that there will be a minimalist approach to equivalence decisions,\u201d Lawlor said.","47":"LONDON, July 1 (Reuters) - Cboe Global Markets said on Wednesday it will launch derivatives trading and clearing at its new European hub in Amsterdam next year as it completes a costlier-than-expected takeover of EuroCCP clearing house.  The Chicago-based group had already opened a share trading hub in the Dutch financial capital in October 2019 to avoid Brexit disrupting European share trading operations in London.  It will build on the hub to offer trading in equity futures and options based on six Cboe Europe stock indices in the first half of 2021, with plans to add more benchmarks later.  \u201cFull ownership of a leading equities clearing house not only enhances our current European equities business, but also provides opportunities to diversify our business into trading and clearing derivatives in the region,\u201d said Ed Tilly, chairman of Cboe Global Markets.  EuroCCP currently clears for 37 trading platforms that represent close to 95% of all equity trades on exchanges in Europe.  As part of the 36-million euro ($40.3 million) takevoer, Cboe has committed to putting in place a credit facility for EuroCCP worth up to 1.5 billion euros.  The loan is needed to fix \u201cliquidity weaknesses\u201d identified by the European Union\u2019s markets watchdog ESMA following a stress test of clearing houses.  Cboe reaffirmed that acquiring EuroCCP and investment in creating a Dutch derivatives market are expected to reduce earnings per share by about $0.08 to $0.10 in 2020 and 2021.  \u201cHowever, the company now expects the impact to be at the higher end of the range, primarily reflecting higher than originally projected facility fees associated with EuroCCP\u2019s new 1.5 billion euro backup line of credit,\u201d it said.","48":"LONDON, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Banks and asset managers in Britain can use exchanges from the European Union to trade shares from January, Britain\u2019s financial regulator said on Wednesday, creating a cross-border clash in securities rules for investors.  Britain left the EU in January and access to the bloc ends on Dec. 31, leaving both sides to decide where investors in their jurisdictions are obliged to trade shares.  The EU\u2019s securities watchdog ESMA has already said that investors from the bloc can only trade sterling-denominated shares in London, Europe\u2019s centre for multi-currency cross-border stock trading on platforms like the London Stock Exchange\u2019s Turquoise, Cboe, and Aquis Exchange.  But Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority said on Wednesday it would allow firms to continue from January trading all shares on trading venues from the EU where they choose to do so, rather than limiting themselves to platforms headquartered in Britain.  \u201cAny restriction on the trading of shares based on currency does not reflect the multicurrency nature of global capital markets and limits the ability of firms to determine how best to use global capital markets to support economic activity,\u201d the FCA said in a statement.  Brussels had hoped that Britain would oblige investors in the United Kingdom to use domestic platforms to avoid a clash in regulatory requirements.  The FCA said it remains open to discussing with ESMA how to minimise any disruption that could arise from overlapping requirements on financial counterparties.  \u201cOur approach, driven by our objectives, will preserve the ability of UK-based firms to execute their share trades at the venues where they can get the best outcomes for themselves and their customers,\u201d the FCA said.

If the floor is closed, markets will remain available for trading electronically, according to CME. The company, which owns the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange, asked employees and clients to test their ability to connect to its systems remotely.  \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, we disinfected the entire trading floor space over the weekend,\u201d CME said in the notice it shared with Reuters. \u201cWe will continue our increased cleaning procedures on the floor and common areas as well.\u201d  Open-outcry trading was a raucous tradition in which traders jostled and screamed to execute orders in pits packed with people. CME closed most futures pits in 2015 after the practice declined because of computerized trading. Products like Eurodollar and grain options are still traded in pits.  Cboe Global Markets Inc said it too was restricting visitors to its trading floor in Chicago. It also replaced some fingerprint scanners with ID badge scanners at the main entry points to its building.  The London Metal Exchange, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd, has made contingency plans to relocate or ditch open-outcry trading if the coronavirus outbreak worsens. In a circle of padded, red-leather seats, traders use arcane hand signals in five- or 10-minute bursts of intense trading at the world\u2019s oldest and largest market for industrial metals.  \u201cContingency plans for the ring are dependent on exact circumstances but could include the relocation of the ring to our recovery site in Chelmsford or, if necessary, switching from ring-based to electronic price discovery,\u201d the LME said in a statement.  Open-outcry traders have been known to come to work when they are sick because otherwise they do not make money. The health risks of working on a trading floor have eased as the number of traders dwindles, traders said.","50":"Feb 7 (Reuters) - Exchange operator Cboe Global Markets Inc reported a 37% fall in quarterly profit on Friday, as lower volatility hit the company\u2019s transaction business.

FILE PHOTO: A long exposure shows traffic flowing past the illuminated word \"Boerse\" (exchange) at the seat of Swiss stock exchange operator SIX Group in Zurich, Switzerland June 17, 2019. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann\/File Photo  Investors in the European Union and Switzerland lost direct access to each others\u2019 stock exchanges from July 1 as the two sides squabbled over a partnership treaty that has stalled after years of talks.  The fall-out from the dispute is being closely watched in Britain as a test case for how EU shares may be traded in London after the country leaves the European Union.  Total volumes on SIX, the Swiss stock exchange, breached 2.5 billion shares in the 21 trading days to July 30, up 45% from a year ago and the highest for the month of July in at least five years, according to an analysis of Refinitiv data.  That marks an 18% rise from June. On an average daily basis, activity has jumped 6.6% from June and as much as 52% from July last year, according to Reuters analysis of the data.  Final data is likely to show monthly activity amongst the highest of the last year, illustrating how the prolonged row has upset equity trade flows in the first month after the Swiss government blocked trading of Swiss shares on EU exchanges.  The Refinitiv data covers all asset classes, but the bulk of SIX business is in equities.  (GRAPHIC - Swiss volumes 2: tmsnrt.rs\/2MpMw0e)  A spokesman for SIX said the exchange has seen a roughly 20% jump in turnover, which is measured in Swiss francs, this month compared with June.  Brussels blocked EU-based investors from trading on Swiss bourses as the row escalated over the treaty, which would see non-EU member Switzerland routinely adopt EU single market rules. The Swiss then retaliated by banning EU venues from hosting Swiss stock trading.  There is little sign that the political impasse, which has soured ties with Switzerland\u2019s biggest trading partner, will be broken anytime soon.  Other factors may have contributed to the rise in activity this month. The European and U.S. central banks have grown increasingly dovish, the damaging trade row between the United States and China has rumbled on and the second-quarter earnings season kicked off.  But the data suggests disruption so far has been limited, with investors shifting to trade directly on the domestic bourse. The frenzied activity has also defied the normal slowdown seen in the summer months.  \u201cWe are satisfied that from a technical perspective it went smoothly and that there is trading going on\u201d, even though activity usually drops in July, the SIX spokesman said.  He said getting a deal with Brussels remains a top priority for the exchange and Switzerland as a financial center.  (GRAPHIC - Swiss volumes jump: tmsnrt.rs\/2ypbyEP)  An analysis of how trading was carried out shows a pronounced shift to on-exchange trading, known as \u201clit exchange\u201d volume, accounted for most of the jump in overall activity, offsetting a drop in over-the-counter (OTC) trading.

FILE PHOTO: Hot air balloons fly over Canary Wharf during the Lord Mayor's Hot Air Balloon Regatta, in London, Britain June 9, 2019. REUTERS\/Simon Dawson  Although Oct. 31 is the third deadline for Brexit, the European Commission said that some \u201cresidual\u201d preparations for a no-deal exit remain for insurance and payments companies, and access to market infrastructure.  Financial companies using London as a gateway to the EU - their most important customers - have had to open subsidiaries in the bloc to ensure continuity of service in case of a no-deal departure.  Staff relocations, however, have been kept to a minimum after Brexit was pushed back for a second time.  \u201cThe Commission is working with EU-level and national supervisors to ensure that firms\u2019 contingency plans are fully implemented, and it expects that UK supervisors will not prevent firms from implementing such plans,\u201d an update from the Commission on its no-deal Brexit plans said.  \u201cHowever, if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement on 31 October 2019, this will necessarily result in some market fragmentation in financial services,\u201d the EU executive said.  Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has cautioned banks not to leave their UK operations with too few senior officials to monitor risks.  Plans by trading platforms in London, such as Cboe and Aquis to move trading in EU27 shares to new EU hubs have also been put on hold after the FCA and EU clashed over where shares can be traded by the bloc\u2019s investors.  Simon Morris, a financial lawyer at CMS in London, said British regulators were committed to ensuring open financial markets, and have repeatedly emphasized the importance of maintaining EU-wide regulatory cooperation.  \u201cThere is, therefore, every likelihood that the FCA and the Prudential Regulation Authority will cooperate with their EU counterparts to ensure continuity of provision of cross-border services after even the most disorderly Brexit,\u201d Morris said.  The EU executive said in its update on Wednesday that it was committed to stable and open financial markets.  But it was working with member states to \u201cpreserve financial stability and avoid harming the level playing field in the single market for financial services\u201d.  National regulators across the EU have been told by Brussels they cannot soften requirements on staffing new hubs to lure business from London.","56":"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s financial services industry, the country\u2019s biggest tax earner, risks being cut adrift from its main export market - the European Union - after Brexit.  FILE PHOTO: The Canary Wharf financial district is seen from the construction site of 22 Bishopsgate in London, Britain June 25, 2019. REUTERS\/Hannah McKay  Banks, insurers and asset managers in Britain currently have free rein in seeking customers, investors and markets across the EU, helping to maintain London\u2019s standing as a top global financial center.  But with Brexit potentially only two weeks away, it is not clear exactly how much EU access Britain\u2019s financial sector will be able to retain.  Britain and the EU are locked in talks on a divorce settlement they hope to conclude at an EU summit on Thursday.  Britain\u2019s parliament, due to hold a special session on Saturday, would have to endorse any deal.  These are the scenarios faced by financiers as the clock ticks down to Brexit Day on October 31:  THIRD EXTENSION  Britain has already extended its Brexit deadline twice to October 31. Another extension would allow the finance industry in Britain to maintain full access to the EU until a new Brexit date.  Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than ask for another extension. But parliament has passed a law requiring Britain to make a request for an extension if no deal is agreed.  More than 300 banks, insurers and asset managers in Britain have already opened new EU hubs to ensure continuity of service with European customers whatever form Brexit takes.  The two Brexit extensions have slowed down the relocation of jobs and activities, such as share trading, from London to new bases in the EU, despite pressure from EU regulators for Britain\u2019s financial firms to put more boots on the ground.  Another lengthy extension would be likely to put the brakes on the shifting of more business from London to EU centers such as Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Dublin.  A DEAL  A divorce settlement between Britain and the EU would mean business as usual for the financial sector during a fixed transition period.  An earlier draft withdrawal agreement included a transition phase until the end of 2020 to allow time for new trading arrangements between Britain and the EU to be slotted into place.  After this transition period, the EU has said that market access for Britain\u2019s financial sector would be based on the bloc\u2019s \u201cequivalence\u201d regime.  Under this system, Brussels grants direct access to EU markets if it deems that Britain\u2019s financial rules are aligned closely enough with those in the EU.  The process, which is also used by financial firms in Japan, Singapore and the United States, can be long and complex.  The EU has said that if there is a Brexit deal it could fast-track approval of UK equivalence in 2020 to avoid a gap in trading terms after the transition period ends.  But equivalence offers only patchy and unpredictable direct access, which is why so many UK-based firms have set up in the EU. And this has raised questions about how beneficial equivalence will be in practice.  Equivalence would also require Britain to stay aligned to EU rules when UK financial regulators do not want their hands tied.  British regulators do not want to become \u201crule takers\u201d, unable to diverge from EU regulations to tackle new risks that might develop in the UK\u2019s financial sector.  NO-DEAL  Failure to reach a Brexit deal this week, or a refusal to request an extension would potentially mean Britain crashes out of the EU, causing turmoil in financial markets.  There will not be a regulatory vacuum for banks, asset managers and insurers in Britain in a no-deal scenario because the government has put all existing EU rules into UK law.  But no deal would mean only limited direct access to the EU, and then largely via temporary measures, fragmenting markets and relationships built up over decades and raising costs for investors.  And a no-deal Brexit could delay equivalence decisions by Brussels, leaving Britain\u2019s financial sector more isolated from the EU.  Britain, the EU and EU member states have agreed that some cross-border financial activities like asset management and futures trading could continue for a time if there is no deal.  Britain will allow EU banks already operating in the UK to continue on a temporary basis until they obtain permanent authorization. But the EU has not reciprocated for UK banks operating in the bloc, meaning the lenders could face an overnight rupture in EU business.  Swapping personal data cross-border could be disrupted because the EU has yet to deem that standards in Britain for protecting privacy are \u201cadequate\u201d.  Without this, it could be illegal for an EU firm to do business with a UK counterpart if a customer\u2019s personal data is involved.  London is the main center for clearing financial instruments known as interest rate swaps denominated in euros, but under a no-deal Brexit this would end for EU customers in March 2020.  After March next year, customers would then have to shift trillions of euros in contracts from London unless the EU agreed to a clearing extension.  Swathes of trading in euro-denominated shares in London could move to new platforms that have set up in Amsterdam and Paris to ensure continued EU access.  European government bond trading has already moved, but London would retain its dominance in spot currency trading because this market is not regulated.","57":"LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Cboe Europe\u2019s new share trading hub, which launched in Amsterdam on Tuesday, has attracted light trading so far, giving nervous regulators and policymakers in Britain few clues on how much activity will eventually leave London after Brexit.  Faced with the possibility of a no-deal Brexit or patchy UK access to the European Union\u2019s financial markets in future, London-based pan-European Cboe built a Dutch hub to ensure continuity for EU clients.  Volume in Amsterdam has been tiny. On Tuesday trading topped just 2,426 euros, rising to 1.23 million euros on Wednesday, and 3,648 euros so far on Thursday according to Cboe Global Markets data.  An industry veteran described it as \u201ccleaning the pipes\u201d.  Cboe, which typically has the biggest daily market share with about 20% of European stocks, said customers were testing their access to the new platform.  \u201cWe expect initial volumes on Cboe NL will continue to be low as many firms may choose not to adjust their trading strategies until there is more clarity around the shape and timing of Brexit,\u201d a Cboe spokeswoman said.  Customers can still trade EU27 listed shares on Cboe in London if they want to.  Rivals London-based Aquis Exchange and London Stock Exchange\u2019s pan-European platform Turquoise have also built new EU hubs, but have not formally started trading.  Meanwhile, British and EU securities regulators remain at loggerheads over where EU27 shares can be traded in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  It is unclear if Britain and the EU will agree a divorce settlement by Brexit Day on Oct. 31. A deal would mean a business as usual transition period to the end of 2020.  But a crash out could see swathes of share trading moving from London to the three new hubs, denting the capital\u2019s standing as a global financial hub.

REUTERS\/Marika Kochiashvili\/File Photo  The pan-European stock trading platform said on Tuesday that customers would be able to trade EU27 listed stocks in London as well as on its new Paris platform from Monday morning if the UK leaves the European Union without an exit deal. UK and Swiss shares would continue to be offered in London only.  Britain is due to leave the EU on Friday unless it secures a \u201cstandstill\u201d transition agreement to avoid a disruptive departure. Prime Minister Theresa May will ask an EU summit on Wednesday for a delay until at least the end of June.  \u201cMost volume in EU27 stocks would probably be done in London,\u201d Aquis Chief Executive Alasdair Haynes said in a statement.  It originally planned to offer EU27 stocks in Paris only to avoid harming prices by splitting trading.  Larger rivals Cboe and London Stock Exchange\u2019s Turquoise, which have new EU hubs in Amsterdam, have announced similar changes. Aquis says it was going a step further by offering EU27 shares in London immediately after a no-deal Brexit to stop national exchanges in the bloc taking the business.  Cboe and Turquoise have said they would seek to reintroduce EU27 shares in London later in the year.  The EU\u2019s markets watchdog ruled last month that fund managers could only trade 6,200 shares in the bloc if Britain leaves without a deal. These are mostly EU27 listed stocks but also include 14 from Britain.  If Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority takes tit-for-tat action to require UK and many EU shares to be traded in Britain, it would give Aquis an early advantage over Turquoise and Cboe.  Such a retaliatory move was \u201chighly likely\u201d, Haynes said. The FCA has declined to comment on its plans.  Aquis will revert to its preferred plan of trading EU27 shares only in Paris when it is clear the FCA won\u2019t introduce trading curbs, Haynes said.  \u201cMy understanding is that the UK government does not want to see EU27 business move from London to Europe and will do whatever it can, unless some form of equivalence or financial services deal is agreed, to allow business to remain in London,\u201d he said. Trading in European government bonds and repurchase agreements on CME\u2019s London unit has already moved to Amsterdam.","59":"LONDON, March 12 (Reuters) - The repackaging of loans to raise funds for companies has tumbled to its lowest rate since the financial crisis a decade ago, knocking back European Union efforts to deepen its capital market as Brexit looms.  The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) said public issuance of products that bundle loans into an interest-bearing security has fallen to 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) so far in 2019, the slowest start to the year since 2009.  The EU is building a Capital Markets Union (CMU) to raise more funds for companies and ease reliance on banks. Its executive European Commission updates on CMU on Friday.  The shift in market infrastructure by CME and CBOE from London to the EU this week to avoid disruption from Brexit is boosting CMU efforts, however.  \u201cIt\u2019s clear that having the biggest financial centre in the EU about to leave the single market, it\u2019s important that we develop, strengthen our own capital market, supervisory capacity and market infrastructure,\u201d a Commission official said.  \u201cIt\u2019s a question of being able to stand on our own two feet in terms of CMU while also being open to the world.\u201d  Securitisation was an early CMU reform of a sector that turned toxic in 2007 when asset-backed securities based on subprime U.S. home loans crashed, kickstarting a global financial crisis.  The EU created \u201csafe, transparent and standardised\u201d or STS products to restore confidence, but progress is slow.  \u201cThe delay in approval by the EU public authorities of key elements of the new securitisation framework is clearly a factor,\u201d said AFME, a banking trade body.  New rules forcing banks to hold cushions of assets that are easy to sell in a cash crunch are also \u201cunhelpful\u201d, AFME said. Only \u201cSTS\u201d products can be used but none can be eligible until the new framework is completed.  On Friday the Commission will focus on completing the 13 measures proposed, with nine agreed and two more reaching critical phases this week.  EU states and the European Parliament meet on Tuesday evening when they will try again to agree a draft law that strengthens EU-level supervision of markets.  Some countries worry about their own regulators losing power.  EU states and lawmakers also meet on Wednesday morning to agree a draft law that strengthens EU supervision of clearing houses, and the chances of a deal are seen as much higher.  It includes tougher requirements on foreign clearing houses like LCH in London after Brexit.  LCH dominates clearing of euro-denominated swaps, and the new requirements could ultimately mean that more euro clearing is done by rivals like Deutsche Boerse in the EU.","60":"FILE PHOTO: Chair of European Securities and Markets Steven Maijoor speaks at a European Financial Forum event in Dublin, Ireland February 13, 2019. REUTERS\/Clodagh Kilcoyne\/File Photo  LONDON (Reuters) - European markets regulators are considering creating a single record of trading data from the dozens of separate national exchanges and trading venues, to increase transparency and help investors find the cheapest deals.  The mechanism, known as a \u201cconsolidated tape\u201d, has been a longstanding goal for investors in Europe, which has about 20 trading venues, some of which offer the same stocks but publish information on trades and volumes in different ways.  If created, a single record of real-time trading data would mirror a system adopted in the United States decades ago to bolster efficiency in trading by knitting together platforms.  In a statement, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said the consultation is part of its review of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, known as MiFID II, launched last year aimed at making trading cheaper and more transparent.  The regulator said it found that MiFID II has so far not delivered on its objective of lowering the prices of market data.  \u201cEstablishing a consolidated tape in the EU has been discussed for many years. I believe it is time to decide if and how we want to go ahead with this ambitious project,\u201d said ESMA Chair Steven Maijoor.  \u201cWe have received a lot of feedback as to whether the price for market data is reasonable, in addition to concerns on price increases and new fees in an environment driven by technological development and a high demand for market data,\u201d he said.  ESMA said that the lack of commercial incentives for a stock exchange to pool its data, stiff competition from non-regulated entities and a restrictive regulatory framework, have held the project back.  The consultation will close on Sept. 6 and based on feedback, ESMA will report to the European Commission in December.","61":"LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said on Tuesday it will launch a share trading hub in Paris, in the sector\u2019s latest move to avoid disruption to customers after Britain\u2019s full departure from the European Union next month.

Turquoise has said that without the EU agreeing to full two-way market access by Nov. 30, it will start up its new Dutch hub.

No matter what form Brexit takes, it will cause a big shift of financial activity from London to other financial centres in the EU, the paper said. It called for more action to make sure the bloc remains one of the world\u2019s two top financial centres, even without London.  \u201cIrrespective of the precise shape of future relations following the Brexit, non-automatic access from London will result in a significant shift of financial services activities to the EU 27 that will be spread across several financial centres,\u201d the paper said.  It proposed a rebranding of the bloc\u2019s plans to build a capital markets union (CMU), a process that was launched five years ago but has so far seen only patchy progress despite several new laws and a reboot.  The impending departure of Britain, by far the biggest capital market in the bloc, has made the task more pressing. London dominates in derivatives, currencies and pan-European shares, and is expected to compete hard to keep that business even after Brexit.  The paper, published by Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Poland on the sidelines of meetings of euro zone and EU finance ministers in Luxembourg, called for the CMU to be renamed the \u201cSavings and Sustainable Investment Union\u201d, to win more support from a public wary of speculative markets.  It proposes a \u201cpriority shift\u201d to help consumers turn savings into investments, and ensure that the EU remains \u201cone of the top two financial centres of the world\u201d after Brexit.  The focus for \u201cmassively\u201d developing equity markets should be on venture capital and private equity, and creating a non-profit \u201cconsolidated tape\u201d that links all trading platforms to make share trading cheaper.  There is also a need to develop debt, credit and foreign exchange financing tools - core strengths of London\u2019s financial centre - in a manner that \u201cincreases the international funding currency role of the euro\u201d, the paper said.  There is already a battle between UK and EU regulators over where euro-denominated shares can be traded by investors for the bloc after Brexit.  A push to deepen EU equity markets could mean Britain\u2019s market players encounter obstacles when trying to gain access to EU investors after Brexit. Many London-based banks, insurers and asset managers have opened new EU hubs to cope with Brexit.

FILE PHOTO: A man walks past a screen displaying share prices following a vote on Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit 'plan B' at CMC Markets in London, Britain, January 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Dylan Martinez  Licences are granted by national regulators but the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) ensures they don\u2019t offer sweeteners to UK-based firms that want a base to serve EU clients after Britain leaves the bloc, currently scheduled for Oct. 31.  \u201cWe have seen significant movement of activity from the UK to the EU27. The number of authorisations is above 100,\u201d ESMA Chair Steven Maijoor told Reuters during a visit to London.  \u201cThere have also been some that are relocating by beefing up their existing entities in the EU27.\u201d  London is Europe's biggest financial centre, but the CME CME.O has transferred trading in European government bonds and repos from London to its new hub in Amsterdam. The London Stock Exchange LSE.L has moved trading in European government bonds to its Milan base.  CBOE CBOE.Z will offer trading in EU shares at its new Amsterdam hub from October to replicate its London unit, with rival exchange Aquis AQX.L set to follow suit at a new Paris unit.  Maijoor said such preparations for Brexit were largely an issue for the private sector.  Paris-based ESMA directly authorises and supervises credit rating agencies and trade repositories in the EU.  \u201cThere we have seen good progress on getting prepared for the risk of a no-deal Brexit,\u201d Maijoor said.  The likelihood of a no-deal Brexit began to recede this week as Britain\u2019s parliament approves a law to stop this from happening.  There has been concern in the funds industry that a no-deal Brexit would threaten a long-standing global practice known as delegation, whereby asset managers outside the EU can pick stocks for funds listed in the bloc.  Asset managers in London worried they would be under pressure to move to the EU.  \u201cThe EU27 do support the possibility for delegation because it\u2019s a generic way for global capital markets to work,\u201d Maijoor said.  \u201cOn the other hand, it must not undermine the possibility to have a fully-fledged entity in the EU27 and not a shell company, and an entity that can be supervised.\u201d  ESMA, national regulators and Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority have already signed cooperation agreements in the event of a no-deal Brexit, he added.  Fragmentation in Europe\u2019s capital market is inevitable to some extent because Britain is leaving the bloc and its common system of supervision and rules.  \u201cLeaving the single market and starting a new separate regulatory framework is fragmenting markets,\u201d Maijoor said.","66":"FILE PHOTO: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission logo adorns an office door at the SEC headquarters in Washington, June 24, 2011. REUTERS\/Jonathan Ernst\/File Photo  NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court ruled on Tuesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission cannot force stock exchanges to conduct a costly experiment to see how the fees they charge and the incentives they offer affect brokers\u2019 trading habits.  The SEC\u2019s \u201cTransaction Fee Pilot\u201d aimed to shed light on how lucrative rebate payments from exchanges to brokers for stock orders that others can trade against influence the brokers\u2019 behavior.  Critics of the practice, including institutional investors managing tens of trillions of dollars, said the payments create conflicts of interest by incentivizing brokers to send customer orders to exchanges that pay the biggest rebates rather than to those that would get the best results for their end clients.  Intercontinental Exchange Inc\u2019s New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Inc, and Cboe Global Markets Inc sued the SEC over the plan, arguing that rebates are needed to compensate brokers for providing liquidity and that the SEC has not shown they harm the market.  Eliminating rebates would also lead to wider bid-ask spreads, making it more costly to trade, they said.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the plan \u201cclearly exceeded the SEC\u2019s authority under the Exchange Act.\u201d  \u201cThe Pilot Program emanates from an aimless \u2018one-off\u2019 regulation, i.e., a rule that imposes significant, costly, and disparate regulatory requirements on affected parties merely to allow the Commission to collect data to determine whether there might be a problem worthy of regulation,\u201d the court said.  The pilot program, which was recommended by an SEC-appointed committee of market experts as well as the U.S. Treasury, would have tested banning rebates for certain stocks and lowering exchange transaction fees for others.  \u201cWe accept the decision of the D.C. Circuit and appreciate the guidance it provides,\u201d SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in a statement.","67":"LONDON (Reuters) - Europe will see its biggest transfer of share trading in more than two decades when stock exchanges open for business in 2021, with Brexit shifting its centre of gravity away from London.  FILE PHOTO: A general view shows The Bank of England and the City of London financial district, amid the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in London, Britain, November 5, 2020. REUTERS\/John Sibley\/File Photo  While market players hope that years of preparations since Britain voted to leave the European Union means the transition of most euro-denominated assets like shares and derivatives out of the country will be relatively smooth, the long-term impact is unclear.  \u201cThis is a big bang event and that is one of the things that the market hasn\u2019t truly understood yet,\u201d Alasdair Haynes, chief executive of London-based share trading platform Aquis Exchange, told Reuters.  \u201cThis is literally everything moves on a specific day and we have got to pray to God that we don\u2019t have some extraordinary event happen in the market that creates high volumes,\u201d Haynes said.  While the landmark trade deal agreed last week set rules for industries such as fishing and agriculture, it did not cover Britain\u2019s much larger finance sector, meaning automatic access to the EU\u2019s financial markets comes to an end on Dec 31.  The following days will provide a first taste of the effects of the shift and regulators on both sides of the English Channel will be on alert for market dislocations on Jan 4, the first trading day of the new year.  The EU wants to reduce reliance on the City of London for financial services and see more euro-based trading in Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam and other financial centres in the bloc.  That will split Europe\u2019s stock, bond and derivatives markets into two separate trading pools, raising concerns that investors will get less competitive prices.  EU banks must trade euro-denominated shares inside the bloc from Jan. 4, forcing them to switch from platforms run by the likes of Cboe Europe, Aquis Exchange, London Stock Exchange\u2019s Turquoise and Goldman Sachs in London, to EU hubs they have opened in Amsterdam or Paris.  Most shares are still traded on their home exchange, but between them London platforms account for nearly all cross-border trading in shares in the remaining 27 EU states.  That amounted to 8.6 billion euros ($10.4 billion) a day collectively in October, or a quarter of all European trading, Cboe data shows.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  David Howson, president of Cboe Europe, said almost all cross-border European stock trading will switch overnight.  The last time there was such a rapid shift in volumes was in 1998 when trading in 10-year German Bund futures by dealers in stripy jackets on the LIFFE exchange floor in London was lured by cheaper electronic screens to Frankfurt.  \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest single share trading shift in the last two decades at least,\u201d Howson said.  \u2018HUGE OWN GOAL\u2019  For Aquis, more than half of its business will in future be in the EU rather than all in London, while Cboe is hopeful that clearing in share trades could move from rivals in London to its own clearing house in Amsterdam over time.  Goldman Sachs expects half the daily trading in shares on its Sigma-X Europe trading platform to shift over time to its new Paris hub from London.  Cboe held a simulation exercise on Dec. 5 and Howson said this revealed its customers expect to shift all their trading in European shares to EU venues.  Another of London\u2019s top money spinners is its trade in trillions of euros in derivatives. This anomaly, which dates back to 1999 when Britain opted out of the euro\u2019s launch, has seen a dominant share of trading in euro-denominated swaps take place in the capital.  The Bank of England has warned that trade in interest rate swaps worth around $200 billion could be disrupted, because banks operating in Britain and the EU must trade inside their own jurisdiction, or on approved platforms in New York.  It may force Britain at the last minute to ease its restrictions on swaps trading to minimise disruption.  Erik-Jan van Dijk, Achmea Investment Management\u2019s head of treasury and derivatives, said regulators have already taken steps to mitigate some of the risks by allowing EU banks to continue clearing their derivatives in London temporarily.  But trading will have to move, and some counterparties with existing swaps contracts in Britain were reluctant to shift them before they absolutely had to.  \u201cWe may leave some existing positions in the UK and we might choose not to do business with those UK counterparties in future,\u201d van Dijk said.  Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has said he will have all its \u201carmoury\u201d at hand, although so far regulators say they do not expect any threats to financial stability.  \u201cYou can\u2019t rule out that there will be some particular disruption given the scale of change, but overall we are satisfied there has been good proactive management of the risks across the system,\u201d Nikhil Rathi, CEO of Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, told Reuters.  The first day of trading in January may even be a quiet one as volumes could suffer if some market participants sit on the sidelines to see how the dust settles, Cboe and Aquis said.  In the longer term, the focus will be on just how much the volumes build up inside the EU and fall further in Britain.  \u201cIt\u2019s not the start of the end of London, but it\u2019s pretty bloody embarrassing and a huge own goal for Britain,\u201d said Aquis\u2019 Haynes.

FILE PHOTO: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission logo adorns an office door at the SEC headquarters in Washington, June 24, 2011. REUTERS\/Jonathan Ernst\/File Photo  The SEC approved its so-called Transaction Fee Pilot in December, aimed at testing how lucrative rebate payments from exchanges to brokers for stock orders that others can trade against influences brokers\u2019 behavior.  But Nasdaq Inc, Cboe Global Markets and Intercontinental Exchange Inc\u2019s NYSE, which together own 12 of the 13 U.S. stock exchanges, all filed lawsuits against the SEC in February saying the plan was an exercise in government price-setting and would put controls on competition.  \u201cWithout addressing the merits of petitioners\u2019 challenges to the rule or the pilot program, the Commission has determined to exercise that discretion to grant a stay, in part. Pending a decision by the court of appeals,\u201d the SEC said as it put the plan on hold on Thursday.  The big exchange operators had said the one-to-two-year pilot program would hurt the companies whose stocks would not be eligible to receive rebates for liquidity-adding stock orders.  \u201cThe Commission\u2019s action is a positive development for publicly-traded companies and Main Street investors, as it recognizes the arbitrary nature of the program and the complexity of its implementation,\u201d Nasdaq spokesman Joseph Christinat said following the SEC\u2019s announcement.  Cboe also said it was \u201cpleased\u201d with the SEC\u2019s decision.  The SEC, in part, aimed to gather data from the experiment that could show if the rebates, which added up to around $2.5 billion last year, create conflicts of interest by giving incentives to brokers to send customer orders to the exchanges that pay the biggest rebates.  Those customers might get better results elsewhere, say critics of the rebate regime, which include some of the world\u2019s largest asset managers.  The exchanges say rebates help attract liquidity, while also compensating brokers, especially market makers, for taking the risk of providing two-sided bid and ask prices for others to trade against.  The pilot program was recommended by a SEC-appointed committee of market experts, as well as by the U.S. Treasury in a report in late 2017.  Because the SEC granted only a partial stay of the pilot, the exchanges will still have to begin gathering data on broker order routing behavior to provide to the regulator if the pilot goes ahead.","69":"(Repeats with no changes)  NEW YORK, May 1 (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has upended U.S. equities trading with unprecedented market volatility and forced bourses like the New York Stock Exchange to close their trading floors, raising questions about the need for such spaces.  The NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc , closed its stock and options trading floors in New York and San Francisco in March 23 after traders and an ICE employee tested positive for the virus. Rivals CME Group, Cboe Global Markets Inc and Nasdaq Inc also closed their options and futures pits in Chicago and Philadelphia.  Despite the move to all-electronic trading, none of the exchange operators experienced any major technical glitches amid record volumes, and all of them reported first-quarter profits that beat analysts\u2019 expectations.  Cboe aims to reopen its options trading floor on June 1 after acknowledging that some customers were frustrated by the exchange\u2019s electronic trading tools and were unable to get the most risky and complex types of orders completed, it said on Friday.  At the same time, Chief Executive Ed Tilly said Cboe will soon roll out new electronic solutions that will replicate benefits of the floor for those more complex orders, prompting analysts to question the need to reopen the spaces at all.  \u201cOur position has always been that when our customers tell us that there\u2019s no utility in the trading crowd, when brokers provide no service to their customers, the electronic solution will close the trading floor, not Cboe and not its management team,\u201d Tilly said.  The NYSE is the only U.S. exchange that still operates stock trading floors alongside electronic trading. It released a study on Thursday showing that floor traders dampen volatility by providing tighter bid-offer spreads, especially at the market close, saving investors millions of dollars a day.  While the floor distinguishes NYSE from its competitors, the closure has not led to a significant drop in market share, according to an analysis released Friday by industry trade group, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.  \u201cOnly time will tell if investors feel the difference in execution of their trades with or without the human interaction on the floor,\u201d the study said.  The NYSE plans to reopen its San Francisco-based options floor on Monday. It has not given a date for the reopening of its iconic floors at 11 Wall Street.  CME, which runs the world\u2019s largest futures exchange, said on Wednesday it was unclear when it would reopen its trading floors, where about 10% of its business was done.  \u201cWe will not do anything irrational either way until we know exactly where health officials and government officials are going to come down as far as multiple people getting together in a single location,\u201d CEO Terry Duffy told analysts on a call.  The closure had little effect on trading activity, CME said.  \u201cParticipants can trade any strategy today as easily as they could prior to the closure of the floor,\u201d said Sean Tully, a senior managing director at the exchange.

The EU has long sought to copy the United States and have a \u201cconsolidated tape\u201d that knits stock prices traded on upwards of 20 platforms and exchanges across the bloc, making it easier for investors to find the best prices.  Previous efforts foundered after disagreements on how much exchanges could charge for data, making a tape commercially unviable.  The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said that EU securities rules known as MiFID II have failed to cut the cost of stock market data for users like banks and asset managers.  \u201cMoreover, as no consolidated tape has materialised, ESMA recommends the establishment of a European Union (EU) wide real-time consolidated tape for equity instruments,\u201d ESMA said in a statement.","71":"Slideshow ( 3 images )  NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange is taking steps to separate traders on the floor of its iconic 11 Wall Street building and employees of the NYSE and its parent Intercontinental Exchange Inc ICE.N, to reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus, according to an internal memo sent Wednesday.  The steps, which include mandating separate entrances and eating spaces for floor traders and staff, are aimed at reducing the likelihood that an event in the building\u2019s office tower will impact operations on the trading floor, NYSE Chief Operating Officer Michael Blaugrund, said in the memo, seen by Reuters.  Non-working visitors to the NYSE floor have been kept to a minimum this week, the building has intensified overnight cleaning efforts, and an outside vendor will provide extra deep cleaning on weekends, it said.  \u201cGiven the critical work by our NYSE and NYSE American floor communities to underpin the orderly function of global markets, all of these efforts, and others, will remain ongoing until further notice,\u201d the memo said.  Concerns about how the fast-spreading coronavirus will affect the economy have led to global stock market routs, with volumes and volatility spiking to levels not seen since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  While nearly all U.S. stock trading is done electronically, the NYSE says its hybrid electronic and floor broker model helps keep trading more orderly.  But even the Big Board can operate fully electronically if the floor needs to be shut. The NYSE and exchange operators Nasdaq Inc NDAQ.O, Cboe Global Markets Inc CBOE.Z, and IEX Group have all said they have regularly tested contingency plans in place to ensure continuous trading if the coronavirus leads to some facilities being temporarily shuttered.  To reduce the chance of that happening, only NYSE and ICE staff who work in the 11 Wall Street\u2019s office tower will be able to eat in the NYSE cafeteria, the memo said. Those who work on the floor will have access to a special food service from NYSE\u2019s Trading Floor Coffee Kiosk.  A restaurant on the exchange\u2019s 7th floor named 1792, after the year the NYSE was founded under a buttonwood tree on Wall Street, will be temporarily closed.","72":"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s markets watchdog said on Tuesday it wants to keep stock markets open despite the extreme sell-offs seen in recent sessions, which have prompted some European countries to introduce trading curbs.  The watchdog also signalled more flexibility for traders who are executing stock transactions from back-up sites or from home.  \u201cOur aim is to continue to maintain open and orderly markets notwithstanding current volatility,\u201d the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said in a statement.  Separately, the London Stock Exchange LSE.L said it has no plans to suspend trading as companies \"continue to need access to capital\", and will ensure that pricing of shares is conducted in a fair and transparent manner.  The FCA\u2019s U.S. counterpart, the Securities and Exchange Commission, said on Monday it would keep Wall Street open for trading despite a plunge in U.S. shares and speculation the government would shut down markets.  The FCA said it was ready to \u201ctake any steps necessary\u201d to ensure that customers are protected and that markets continue to function well.  Banks have already begun trading shares and other securities from split sites to minimise the potential for the coronavirus to spread among their staff.  This, and the prospect of traders having to execute transactions from home - which has yet to happen at major banks - has raised questions about meeting compliance requirements such as having equipment to record and track trades for regulators to spot any market abuses.  \u201cFirms should continue to record calls, but we accept that some scenarios may emerge where this is not possible,\u201d the FCA said. It had previously said that firms should continue to meet all compliance requirements like recording calls.  \u201cThis signifies a slight and sensible shift in approach,\u201d said Jake Green, a regulation partner at law firm Ashurst.  The FCA said firms should make it aware if they are unable to meet these requirements.  \u201cWe expect firms to consider what steps they could take to mitigate outstanding risks if they are unable to comply with their obligations to record voice communications,\u201d it said.  Traders could introduce \u201cenhanced monitoring, or retrospective review\u201d once normal trading resumes, the FCA said.  ACCESS TO CASH  Some firms have taken steps to enable customers\u2019 access to cash, such as waiving fees for savings accounts and allowing them to end their term deposits early, the FCA said.  \u201cUK firms have taken steps to help ensure consumers have access to cash, including the raising of cash machine withdrawal limits,\u201d the FCA said.  \u201cWe are confident electronic payment providers have capacity to cope with the potential changes in transaction numbers.\u201d  The FCA will also hold talks with banks in coming days regarding how to further help mortgage customers.  \u201cIn the current climate, we want firms to show greater flexibility to customers in persistent credit card debt,\u201d it added.  The watchdog said firms that it regulates should report to the FCA immediately if they believe they will be in difficulty.  To allow firms to focus on supporting customers, the FCA said it was extending the closing date for responses to public consultations until October and rescheduling most other work.  \u201cThe FCA\u2019s steps to help minimise demand on the industry\u2019s existing capacity in the short term means that our focus can be pointed toward customer-care strategies,\u201d UK Finance, a banking industry body, said in response to the FCA update.","73":"FILE PHOTO: Signage is seen outside the entrance of the London Stock Exchange in London, Britain.

FILE PHOTO: An EU flag flies beside Switzerland's national flag near the German-Swiss border in Rheinfelden, Germany, March 11, 2019. REUTERS\/Arnd WIegmann\/File Photo  The pact with Switzerland that Brussels has sought for a decade and which was negotiated over 4-1\/2 years would effectively cement the non-EU member state\u2019s participation in the EU single market, the biggest outlet for Swiss exports.  But political resistance to the treaty in Switzerland has held up the process. As a result, a frustrated EU says it will not recognize the Swiss stock market\u2019s rules as \u201cequivalent\u201d to its own beyond the end of June.  The Swiss government has responded with countermeasures, including a new system from July 1 that requires foreign stock exchanges to get Swiss permission to host trading in Swiss stocks.  Wilful, as well as negligent, violations of the Swiss requirements could result in criminal charges and even jail.  WHAT THE NEW RULES MEAN  The EU\u2019s decision not to recognize the Swiss stock market regulations\u2019 so-called equivalency beyond the end of June will effectively prevent EU-based banks and brokers from trading on Swiss exchanges. They traditionally generate more than half the turnover on Swiss stock markets.  The new Swiss regime, which aims to head off a possible liquidity crunch and to steer share trading to Swiss markets, requires foreign exchanges to get Swiss permission to host trading in Swiss stocks. Trading venues outside the EU would get a green light to carry on as before.  Barring an unlikely last-minute deal, pan-European stock trading platforms Aquis Exchange Plc, Cboe Europe and the London Stock Exchange will not be able to host trading in Swiss equities from July 1.  Such venues host a third of Swiss equities trading volume.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  WHO COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE SWISS BAN?  Foreign trading venues, including stock exchanges and so-called multilateral trading facilities will be affected. Switzerland will let them host trading in Swiss-registered companies like Nestle, Roche and Novartis only if the foreign venues\u2019 regulations do not curb trading of Swiss stocks in Switzerland.  Markets outside the EU will not be affected. Once Brexit takes effect, British share trading platforms could be certified provided their regulation does not interfere with trading on Swiss markets.  WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO VIOLATORS?  Wilful and negligent violations of the Swiss rules could result in criminal charges. Sanctions can target foreign trading venues as well as their management or board of directors. Intentional violations can trigger imprisonment of up to three years or a fine; negligence could be punished with a fine.  WHY IS THE EU-SWISS TREATY SO CONTROVERSIAL?  The Swiss\/EU deal would have Switzerland routinely adopt changes to single market rules. It would also create a more effective platform to resolve trade disputes and open a path to new trade deals such as an electricity union.  The pact would be an over-arching accord above a patchwork of 120 separate deals that already govern bilateral Swiss\/EU ties and which emerged after Swiss voters in 1992 rejected plans to join the European Economic Area. These individual agreements were crafted when Switzerland still aimed to join the EU, a goal it has since dropped.  But the trade deal has become tangled up in domestic politics in Switzerland, which has parliamentary elections on Oct. 20. Those opposed to the EU trade deal range from the right-wing Swiss People\u2019s Party (SVP) to the center-left Social Democrats (SP) and their allied labor unions.  The anti-EU SVP resents giving Brussels any say in Swiss affairs, while the left is dead set against diluting Swiss labor rules meant to protect Europe\u2019s highest wages from potential cut-rate EU workers on temporary cross-border assignments. That is a key demand from Brussels, which wants to avoid being soft on the Swiss with a potentially messy Brexit looming.  HOW LONG MIGHT THE STANDOFF LAST?  In theory, indefinitely, but both sides have said they are open to talks to break the logjam. In effect, the next deadline for Switzerland to sign the treaty and start the ratification process is the end of October.  That is when European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, a self-declared Swiss ally, leaves office and when a no-deal Brexit seems increasingly likely. But Swiss officials say there is no point signing a deal that is doomed to fail in parliament or get shot down by voters under the Swiss system of direct democracy.

Golden, who says wagers on market calm earned him millions in the past six years, is among the investors who have kept trading complex financial products linked to the Cboe Volatility Index .VIX - Wall Street's \"fear gauge\" - in the months since some of those products blew up.  \u201cThe majority of \u2018vol sellers\u2019 were not damaged in February. It was the Johnny-come-latelies and people who shouldn\u2019t have been trading volatility in the first place,\u201d Golden said.  This market is back in focus after another rapid stock market slide pushed VIX to as high as 29 from early October lows under 12, and given a gradual rebuilding of trades betting the volatility will not last.  While many investors smarted, others kept coming and between March and September, more than $1.2 billion rolled into U.S.-based exchange-traded volatility products, according to Reuters calculations based on data from FactSet Research Systems Inc, which tracks the investments.  That compares with $1.7 billion the month before the early February \u201cVolmaggedon\u201d when stocks sold-off briefly on fleeting inflation fears, the VIX shot up to 50 on Feb. 6 from 18 the day before, and some investors lost over 90 percent of their investment.  Golden, who gained prominence after the New York Times profiled him in 2017 and now runs a website that offers advice to traders, said that he had already more than recovered his February losses as he kept borrowing VIX exchange-traded products, selling them and buying them back when the price goes down. Reuters could not independently verify his accounting.  Golden said he cashed in some of his profits before the latest volatility spike and now was waiting for the market to reverse to get back in.  \u201cThese are the days I live for,\u201d he said during the market selloff this week. [.N]  The February crash sparked a debate whether the VIX index and the related products were prone to manipulation and led to dozens of lawsuits and ongoing probes into the matter by U.S. regulators.

REUTERS\/Michael Hirtzer\/File Photo  LESS LEVERAGE  Since then, both the Cboe exchange CBOE.Z, which owns the VIX index, and issuers of some of the related products have made changes they say should make the market less prone to violent, hard-to-anticipate swings.  The exchange has modified its auctions that determine the price of VIX futures to boost liquidity while the backers of some of the volatility products tweaked them to reduce leverage.  For example, ProShare Capital Management LLC, backers of the widely used ProShares-brand vol products, restructured one product so it would aim to move less in response to changes in the market, losing 0.5 percent, instead of 1 percent, when the index it tracks increases by 1 percent.  So far, those steps seem to have worked.  The $370 million ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF SVXY.P, which tumbled over 80 percent in a single day in February, sank 8.3 percent on Wednesday, lost 4.6 percent on Thursday and rebounded 3 percent on Friday morning.  Early this month, Barclays Plc analysts who argued the February plunge was \u201ctechnical in nature\u201d wrote that a strong U.S. economy and so far limited economic impact from trade conflicts, emerging market currency declines and upcoming congressional elections should support the short-vol trade.  This week, however, they said their views have changed given an increased chance of a Federal Reserve policy misstep and investors\u2019 increased focus on the effects of a trade war between the United States and China.  \u201cWe expect volatility to remain elevated in the short term and do not recommend buying this dip,\u201d they wrote.  \u201cThe difference is that this time there are some genuine catalysts we can point to,\u201d one of the authors, Maneesh Deshpande, told Reuters.  While investors trade VIX futures to guard against market declines and turmoil, those derivatives have a tendency to lose value in steadily rising markets as demand for such protection declines. Inverse-vol products launched and listed on exchanges after the 2007-2009 financial crisis allowed investors to take advantage of that and profit during extended spells of market calm.  (Graphic: VIX futures and ETPs - reut.rs\/2yxZZun)  Originally designed as a sophisticated hedging tool for professional investors to help manage their daily market exposure, inverse-volatility products became popular among small investors when the products listed on exchanges and took on a new life as a lucrative bet on market calm.  Gains of nearly 600 percent over two years up to February vaulted the products onto various lists of top performing investments and made them the subject of excited conversation on social media and financial websites.  \u201cThe pros, a lot of them were right back in there a week or two after February,\u201d said Russell Rhoads, head of derivatives research at TABB Group LLC.  \u201cThere\u2019s lots of people trying to pick stocks. The major hedge funds are all doing the same thing, and the volatility space has opened things up for people that are willing to do the work to find a new way to speculate on the market.\u201d  Some analysts blamed the severity of the crash in part on excessive leverage and over-confidence of ill-prepared retail investors.  \u201cIt\u2019s more or less a substitute for going to Las Vegas - you can do it from your home office,\u201d said Robert Whaley, a professor at Vanderbilt University who developed VIX.  Whaley stands by VIX as a market gauge but is concerned that volatility-themed exchange-traded products pose risk to retail investors.  There is no record of how many retail investors are in the trade, but available data suggests they still play a sizeable role in the market.  Institutions required to report certain holdings, typically traders and fund managers overseeing more than $100 million, account for between 3 percent and 62 percent of U.S. volatility exchange-traded funds\u2019 assets, with the balance held by those who do not make such filings, including smaller funds and retail investors, Refinitiv data shows.  Stuart Barton, managing partner at Invest in Vol LLC, an investment adviser, which uses the products, said those investors are taking big risks again.  \u201cThe moves by the surviving products to lower their leverage has been a good move but that\u2019s only half the story,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople just take twice the position.\u201d","78":"Nov 1 (Reuters) - Cboe Global Markets Inc:  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS REPORTS RECORD TRADING ACTIVITY  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS INC - IN MONTH OF OCTOBER, CBOE VOLATILITY INDEX FUTURES TRADED AT CBOE FUTURES EXCHANGE HAD VOLUME OF 9.66 MILLION CONTRACTS  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS - IN OCTOBER, CBOE VOLATILITY INDEX (VIX) FUTURES TRADED AT CBOE FUTURES EXCHANGE (CFE) HAD MONTHLY VOLUME OF 9.66 MILLION CONTRACTS  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS INC - CBOE S&P 500 OPTIONS TRADED MONTHLY VOLUME OF 41.40 MILLION CONTRACTS IN OCTOBER  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS INC - CFE\u2019S TOTAL VOLUME ALSO REACHED MONTHLY HIGH OF 9.72 MILLION CONTRACTS IN OCTOBER  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS INC - SPX WEEKLYS OPTIONS HAD AVERAGE DAILY VOLUME OF 1.12 MILLION CONTRACTS IN OCTOBER Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","79":"(Reuters) - CME Group\u2019s fourth-quarter profit trounced Wall Street estimates on Thursday, as a broad market sell-off toward the end of the quarter prompted investors to rebalance their portfolios and boosted trading volumes.

The company, however, warned that trading volumes, across many asset classes, have already started slowing this year.  CME\u2019s average daily volume (ADV) surged 31 percent to 20.8 million contracts in the quarter, lifting clearing and transaction fees, its biggest revenue stream, 36 percent to $1.03 billion.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Brokers and traders have complained for years about what they say are unjustifiably high fees charged by the big U.S. stock exchanges for data on stock trades. The news of the new exchange on Monday pushed down the share prices of the parent companies of the NYSE and Nasdaq.  \u201cThe announcement is the latest salvo in the on-going fee battle between exchanges and other market participants, and one which should be taken seriously at least from the perspective of the potential earnings pressure on existing exchanges,\u201d said Nathan Flanders of Fitch Ratings.  In a joint statement on Monday, the companies creating the new exchange said it would look to increase competition, improve operational transparency, reduce fixed costs and simplify equity trading in the United States. Data fees are one of the biggest costs for brokers.  The venture will be called Members Exchange, or MEMX, and will be funded and controlled by nine institutions: Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Charles Schwab Corp, E*TRADE Financial Corp, TD Ameritrade Holdings Corp, UBS, Virtu Financial, Morgan Stanley, Fidelity and Citadel.  This is not the first time that industry giants have taken on the established exchanges. A decade ago, a group including Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch backed a low-cost exchange called BATS. Around the same time, other industry heavyweights launched an exchange called Direct Edge with a similar goal of slashing trading costs. The two exchanges quickly gained market share, later merged and are now owned by Cboe Global Markets.  Banks tried a similar move in Europe by setting up Turquoise to trade cross-border shares as a stick to persuade incumbent exchanges to cut data fees. Turquoise partly succeeded in its aim, but ended up being bought by the London Stock Exchange.  Last year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked stock exchanges to do a better job justifying their fees for public market data. It also repealed two data price changes last May for public feeds for Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange-listed securities for the first time.  MEMX, which plans to offer a simple trading model with basic order types and the latest technology, will also represent the interests of its founders\u2019 collective client base of retail and institutional investors.  It will offer \u201clower pricing on market data, and connectivity and transaction fees,\u201d it said.  The big three U.S. exchanges have faced criticism for surging fees for services like data feeds that brokers use to monitor movements in stock prices.  Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE) owns the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq is run by Nasdaq Inc and the other exchange is Cboe.  Shares of ICE were down 2.6 percent and those of Nasdaq Inc were 2.8 percent lower.  In early 2019 MEMX will file an application with the SEC seeking approval to operate as a national securities exchange, according to the statement.  The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) hit back against criticism of bourses on Monday, saying price feeds would not exist but for the role they play.  \u201cThe price at which information is licensed is accordingly a commercial matter for each individual consumer and exchange. The WFE stands ready to assist any regulators who are concerned about the role and nature of market data,\u201d the WFE said.","81":"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin soared to its highest in almost five months on Tuesday, pulling smaller cryptocurrencies up with it, after a major order by an anonymous buyer set off a frenzy of computer-driven trading, analysts said.  The original cryptocurrency soared as much as 20 percent in Asian trading, breaking $5,000 for the first time since mid-November. By mid-afternoon, it had settled around $4,800, still up 16 percent in its biggest one-day gain since April last year.  Bitcoin surged to near $20,000 in late 2017, the peak of a bubble driven by retail investors. But last year prices collapsed by three-quarters, with trading dominated by smaller hedge funds and crypto-related firms.  Today\u2019s gain was probably triggered by an order worth about $100 million spread across U.S.-based exchanges Coinbase and Kraken and Luxembourg\u2019s Bitstamp, said Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, chief executive of cryptocurrency firm BCB Group.  \u201cThere has been a single order that has been algorithmically-managed across these three venues, of around 20,000 BTC,\u201d he said.  \u201cIf you look at the volumes on each of those three exchanges \u2013 there were in-concert, synchronized, units of volume of around 7,000 BTC in an hour\u201d.  Still, analysts could not point to any specific developments that could explain the mystery buyer\u2019s big order.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Cryptocurrency markets had until today seen a period of relative calm through the year, with bitcoin trading around $3,300 and $4,200.  Big institutional investors have largely stayed on the sidelines. Concern over security breaches and regulatory uncertainty were cited as reasons for the lack of mainstream enthusiasm in digital coins.  In a sign of bitcoin\u2019s failure to gain an equal footing with conventional markets, Cboe Global Markets - which offered the first U.S. bitcoin futures contracts in 2017 - said last month it would no longer offer bitcoin futures contracts.  CME Group Inc continues to list its futures product, which launched soon after Cboe.

Big orders tend to spark buying by algorithmic traders, said Charlie Hayter, founder of industry website CryptoCompare.  As bitcoin surged, 6 million trades occurred in an hour, Hayter said - three to four times the usual amount, with orders concentrated on Asian-based exchanges.

Ethereum\u2019s ether and Ripple\u2019s XRP, respectively the second- and third-largest coins, both jumped by more than 10 percent.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  UK lawmakers are due to vote on Tuesday on an EU divorce settlement. But with less than three weeks to go before Brexit day on March 29, it is still unclear whether the deal will be approved, whether departure from the EU will be delayed, or whether it will happen without agreement.  The report by the New Financial think tank, one of the most detailed yet on the impact of Brexit on financial services, said Dublin alone accounted for 100 relocations, ahead of Luxembourg with 60, Paris 41, Frankfurt 40, and Amsterdam 32.  The independent think tank said half of the affected asset management firms, such as Goldman Sachs Investment Management, Morgan Stanley Investment Management and Vanguard, had chosen Dublin, with Luxembourg the next port of call, attracting firms like Schroders, JP Morgan Wealth Management and Aviva Investors.  Nearly 90 percent of all firms moving to Frankfurt are banks, while two-thirds of those going to Amsterdam are trading platforms or brokers. Paris is carving out a niche for markets and trading operations of banks and attracting a broad spread of firms.  New Financial identified 5,000 expected staff moves or local hires, a figure that is expected to rise in coming years.  A better measure of Brexit\u2019s impact is the scale of assets and funds being transferred, it said.  Ten large banks and investment banks are together moving 800 billion pounds of assets from Britain - or 10 percent of banking assets in the country. A small selection of insurers have shifted a combined 35 billion pounds in assets, and a handful of asset managers have moved a total of 65 billion pounds in funds.  William Wright, founder and managing director of New Financial, said the hit to London was bigger than expected and would get worse.  \u201cBusiness will continue to leak from London to the EU, with more activity being booked through local subsidiaries,\u201d Wright said.  \u201cThis will reduce the UK\u2019s influence in European banking and finance, reduce tax receipts from the industry, and reduce financial services exports to the EU.\u201d  A 10 percent shift in banking and finance activity would cut UK tax receipts by about 1 percent, the report said.  Relocations have cost firms $3 billion to $4 billion, which will be passed on to customers and shareholders, the report said.  But the breadth and depth of relocations so far, combined with pacts between regulators in Britain and the EU, mean the industry is well prepared for whatever form Brexit takes, New Financial said.  London will remain the dominant financial centre for the foreseeable future, but other European cities will chip away at London\u2019s lead over time, it added.

FILE PHOTO: A man wearing a protective face mask walks past the Singapore Exchange (SGX) which stays open during \"circuit breaker\" measures to curb coronavirus COVID-19) in central business district area in Singapore, April 7, 2020. REUTERS\/Edgar Su  The global exchange sector, which thrives in turbulent markets, has outperformed so far this year, falling only 2% in value compared with a 15% drop in world stocks, a Reuters analysis showed.  As countries around the world went into lockdown to slow the spread of the coronavirus, investors repriced the value of assets including stocks, commodities and derivatives, such as futures and options, to reflect recessions. That led to a surge in trading activity as investors tried to hedge positions, while others made bets on where markets were going to bottom out.  Financial exchanges, such as Singapore Exchange Ltd SGXL.SI, Deutsche Boerse DB1Gn.DE and New York Stock Exchange-owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc ICE.N, all saw profits jump as trading-based fee revenues surged.  Asia\u2019s bourses, which are more reliant on volumes than their global peers, have gained the most, the analysis showed, as investors reckon they are best placed to benefit from further volatility.  \"I think on balance the trends that have been in place will continue for quite a while,\" said Scott Gilchrist, who manages an A$680 million ($440 million) portfolio of Japanese stocks at Australia's Platinum Asset Management PTM.AX.  \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to tell, but my sense - and it\u2019s only a gut feel - is that we haven\u2019t fully passed through this period of volatility yet,\u201d he said.

Elsewhere, Deutsche Boerse is up about 3% year-to-date and NYSE-owner ICE is up just under 1%, compared to declines in the DAX .GDAXI and Dow Jones Industrial .DJI indexes of around 19% and 16.5%, respectively.  Graphic - Singapore exchange's out-performance:  ASIA\u2019S STRATEGY PAYS OFF  Investors have sought out Asia\u2019s exchanges for their high exposure to trading volumes, driving share prices up almost 3% this year compared with declines of about 1% for U.S. exchanges and 5% in Europe.  Over the past decade as U.S. and European peers diversified by purchasing data providers and other adjacent businesses to bring in non-trading revenue, which is more stable, Asia\u2019s bourses tended to pursue new financial products, leaving them more dependent on trading revenues, but also with lower debt.  \"Everyone's really concerned about recapitalisations, refinancing,\" said John Pearce, chief investment officer of Australian pension fund UniSuper, the top shareholder of domestic bourse operator ASX Ltd ASX.AX.  \u201cWell, the ASX has got none of those concerns - it\u2019s got no debt and market volatility is actually positive for the ASX, so what you\u2019re really seeing is the market pricing it as a pretty stable annuity,\u201d he said.  Graphic - Exchanges monthly trade volume by region:  To be sure, a repeat of the stratospheric trade volumes of March seems unlikely, especially considering the scale and breadth of the liquidation during the sell-down.  But investors have pointed to Singapore's diversification across asset classes from forex to commodities, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing House Ltd's 0388.HK exposure to China, and technology investment by ASX as boosting long-term prospects.  \u201cRecent outperformance, or resilience, is driven mostly by market volatility,\u201d said Kristy Fong, senior investment director of Asian equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Singapore, whose funds own all three stocks. \u201cWe see these stock exchanges as a good proxy for markets, and given that they are pretty much monopolies with good cash flow, it is quite a safe way to get exposure.\u201d  Graphic - IPOs at leading exchanges in the first quarter:  MONETARY HEADWINDS  Policymakers responded to the coronavirus crisis by slashing interest rates and flooding markets with liquidity. That prevented a quick wave of mass defaults, boosting investor confidence and dampening the wild market swings of March.  The potential for a prolonged bout of rock-bottom rates and lower volatility presents the biggest headwind for exchange operators.  Record trading volumes in the first quarter eased into the second quarter as volatility declined, Ed Tilly, chief executive of Chicago-based stock and options exchange operator Cboe Global Markets CBOE.Z, said on an earnings call last week.  \u201cNo one can say with certainty how this situation will play out, but the path to recovery is unlikely to be linear,\u201d he said.

Nevertheless, volumes are up from a year ago and CME\u2019s executives were upbeat about the outlook on an earnings call last week.  Other operators have seen silver linings, such as a surge in emergency capital-raising in Australia, benefiting ASX.  \u201cI wish every company we owned was trading like ASX,\u201d said UniSuper\u2019s Pearce.

But with that outcome realized, they seemed remarkably calm about not knowing the winner of the U.S. presidential race.  FILE PHOTO: A statue of George Washington stands as Federal Hall across Wall Street from the New York Stock Exchange in Manhattan in New York City, New York, U.S., October 26, 2020. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo\/File Photo  As it turns out, the likelihood of continued gridlock on Capitol Hill provided some solace.  Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge\u201d plummeted as U.S. stocks surged on Wednesday, which investors attributed to near-certainty of a divided Congress. Republicans appeared likely to maintain control of the Senate, diminishing the prospect of a Democratic sweep in Washington.  Several analysts had pointed to a drawn-out election process - including the possibility of a challenge before the Supreme Court - as a dire scenario for U.S. equities. Though that risk is not off the table, the congressional outcomes have removed much uncertainty, investors said. A divided Congress would counterbalance the White House\u2019s agenda whether Republican President Donald Trump or Democrat Joe Biden won the election, they said. In particular, it would reduce the likelihood of corporate tax hikes and increased regulation.  \u201cRegardless of where the presidential slot goes, the market has gained confidence in that trajectory,\u201d said Eric Metz, president and chief investment officer at SpiderRock Advisors.  The Cboe Volatility Index ended 5.98 points lower at 29.57, its biggest one-day decline since April 2. VIX futures also broadly fell, though by more modest amounts than the index.  Having the election in the rear-view mirror also paved the way for a lower VIX, investors said, given an array of anxieties - including civil unrest after Election Day - had already been priced in.  \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing an \u2018all-clear,\u2019 but maybe some of those worst-case scenarios are off the table,\u201d said Matt Thompson, managing partner at Thompson Capital Management.  Given recent history, market participants had geared up for extreme election-related volatility. In 2016, the VIX jumped overnight after Trump\u2019s surprise victory. However, the VIX plummeted the following day as U.S. stocks rallied, reversing course from a late-night plunge in futures.  The VIX posted similar declines on Wednesday. Still, it remains well above its long-term average near 20. December VIX futures were trading above other listed contracts, suggesting concerns about risks into early 2021, such as a resurgence in COVID-19 cases.  \u201cVolatility hasn\u2019t disappeared,\u201d said Stacey Gilbert, portfolio manager for derivatives at Glenmede Investment Management.  Even so, with Election Day over, a massive risk event has been lifted from U.S. markets. Investors homed in on the presidential race as a volatility source nearly a year in advance. Cboe Global Markets listed October and November VIX futures earlier than usual so that investors could hedge for the event. VIX futures reflect volatility expectations for the 30 days following their expiration.  For much of the year - aside from the coronavirus-driven sell-off in U.S. stocks - October futures traded at a premium to other contracts as investors focused on the election as a major risk event. As worries grew over the possibility that a delayed or contested election result would prolong market volatility, November futures began trading at higher prices.  More recently, however, concerns about post-election market swings had begun to recede. In October, volume in VIX puts, used to position for a drop in volatility, surpassed volume in VIX calls, used as a hedge against a rise in volatility. That pattern continued in early afternoon trading on Wednesday.  The potential for extreme market gyrations is likely to diminish in the coming weeks, investors said.  \u201cThe big event is out of the bag,\u201d said Michael Purves, chief executive of Tallbacken Capital Advisors. \u201cEventually things will become a little bit normalized.\u201d","92":"April 23 (Reuters) - Cboe Global Markets Inc:  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS TO HOST 2020 VIRTUAL ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Reuters.Briefs@thomsonreuters.com)","93":"June 27 (Reuters) - Cboe Global Markets Inc:  * CBOE FUTURES EXCHANGE AND AMERICAN FINANCIAL EXCHANGE ANNOUNCE PLANNED LAUNCH OF AMERIBOR FUTURES  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS INC - AMERIBOR FUTURES DEBUT PLANNED FOR TRADE DATE AUGUST 16, 2019  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS INC - AMERIBOR FUTURES WILL BE CASH-SETTLED  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS INC - CFE PLANS TO INITIALLY OFFER 2 AMERIBOR FUTURES PRODUCTS: 3-MONTH AND 7-DAY CONTRACTS, FOLLOWED BY OTHER SHORT-TERM PRODUCTS Source text: reut.rs\/2LpnUEC Further company coverage:","94":"* Traders say shorter day would increase efficiency  * London Stock Exchange to consult with members  * Cboe says best to start later but not end earlier  * European exchange body: current hours \u201cfit for purpose\u201d  LONDON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Banks and fund managers want the European stock trading day shortened by 90 minutes in a radical move they say would improve market efficiency and staff wellbeing - but exchanges are split.  The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), a banking industry body, and UK-based Investment Association (IA), which represents asset managers, said Europe had some of the longest trading hours in the world at 8-1\/2 hours.  This compares with 6-1\/2 hours on Wall Street and 6 hours in Asia, the two industry bodies said in a joint statement on Thursday.  AFME and IA, whose members including Goldman Sachs, Barclays, BlackRock and BNP Paribas account for the bulk of share trading, said they were talking with major European exchanges to explore cutting the trading day by 90 minutes.  The opening bell would be rung at 0900 GMT, an hour later than at present, with the close 30 minutes earlier at 1600 GMT.  The first hour of trading currently attracts light volumes, making it more costly to trade, with over a third of trading in the final hour.  \u201cShortening the hours would concentrate liquidity leading to more consistent trading costs and provide greater time for traders and the market to digest corporate announcements,\u201d AFME and IA said.  Long hours affect the mental health and wellbeing of traders and are a key obstacle to recruiting more diverse staff, in particular for those with family or caring commitments, they added.  The Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates share trading, said last month the number of women in senior financial roles had flat-lined since 2005 despite the sector\u2019s \u201crhetoric\u201d on diversity, with brokers the worst.  The London Stock Exchange said it strongly supported improving diversity and workplace culture, and intended to consider the request in a formal consultation with members and users.  FIT FOR PURPOSE  Share trading in Europe already faces fragmentation due to Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, and differences in trading hours could accentuate any divide.  Rainer Riess, director general of the Federation of European Securities Exchanges, said Europe\u2019s current trading hours were \u201cfit for purpose\u201d and should not be revisited.  \u201cA reduction of trading hours in Europe would give an advantage to other jurisdictions in similar or equivalent time zones to expand their trading hours,\u201d Riess said.  Existing hours reflect investor needs, allow European markets to interact with the United States and Asia, Riess said.  Cboe, Europe\u2019s biggest cross-border exchange, said it would likely make the most sense to shorten sessions at the beginning of the day given they do not overlap with the U.S. market.  Aquis Exchange said that while it welcomed steps to improve markets, cutting trading hours was not the most effective way of boosting diversity or the number of women.

FILE PHOTO - A man takes a photograph of the Canary Wharf financial district from Greenwich Park in London, Britain, January 22, 2017. REUTERS\/Hannah McKay  London is Europe\u2019s biggest financial center, with the EU its top export market, meaning that without contingency arrangements markets, banking, asset management and insurance across Europe would be left in chaos.  But preparations are underway on both sides of the Channel to avoid the worst effects of any no-deal Brexit.  TEMPORARY WORKAROUNDS  Britain is approving a law that would allow branches of EU banks and insurers in Britain to continue serving UK customers, giving them time to apply for permanent authorization.  After the EU refused to reciprocate to cover British banks doing business with European clients, EU states have begun taking unilateral action.  Germany, Italy, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Luxembourg, Ireland and Norway are planning to allow UK financial firms to keep undertaking limited business for a fixed period of time after March if there is no deal, giving breathing space for new EU banking and insurance hubs to get bedded down.  British and EU regulators have agreed pacts to exchange information and cooperate on supervision in the event of a no-deal Brexit to avoid immediate disruption to cross-border activity in derivatives clearing, credit ratings agencies, trade reporting venues and asset management.  WHAT ARE THE BANKS UP TO?  Many international banks use London as their European base but with the possibility of a hard Brexit in the short term, and the likelihood of patchy EU access from Britain in future, they are moving to open hubs in the bloc by March 29.  The banks, which trade stocks, bonds, repos and derivatives, are moving 800 billion pounds of assets to make their new hubs in Frankfurt and Paris operational by next month, according to consultancy EY.  The new hubs will be allowed to continue booking some trades centrally in London for now, on condition they build up activities and staffing within their new operations over the next few years.  LLOYD\u2019S OF BRUSSELS  Lloyd\u2019s of London insurance market has opened a Brussels subsidiary to write European policies and avoid potential disruption to EU customers.  Insurers like AIG are shifting blocks of policies from EU customers to new hubs in the EU to become Brexit-proof by March.  EU insurance watchdog EIOPA has calculated there are 9 million customers across Europe still facing potential disruption to policies worth a collective 7.4 billion euros if there is a no-deal Brexit, but say that is not likely to threaten financial stability and require EU contingency action.  DERIVATIVES ON ICE?  ICE Futures in London is one of Europe\u2019s two main derivatives exchanges - the other is Eurex in Frankfurt.  Unlike stock and bond trading platforms, ICE has no plans to shift trading to the continent. Instead it is obtaining permission from individual EU states like Germany and the Netherlands to allow customers there to continue trading on ICE in London.  Banks are shifting some outstanding derivatives contracts for EU customers from London to new hubs in the bloc.  DELEGATION WINS A REPRIEVE  Asset managers in Britain feared that a no-deal Brexit would stop them from managing funds listed in Luxembourg, Dublin and elsewhere in Europe, a cross-border activity known as delegation.  But regulators from Britain and the EU agreed a pact this month to share information in the event of a no-deal Brexit to allow delegation to continue, triggering a huge sigh of relief in the sector. [nL5N1ZV5A7]  SHARES GOING DUTCH  London-based Cboe Europe, the biggest pan-European stock exchange, is opening a new hub in Amsterdam to which its trading in euro-denominated shares will move from the start of April, irrespective of what sort of Brexit is agreed.  London Stock Exchange\u2019s pan-European Turquoise platform is also opening a hub in Amsterdam by the end of March and could move trading in euro-denominated shares there.  Aquis is opening a new hub in Paris to which it will move its euro-denominated share trading. Shifting trading could be followed by a similar relocation in some clearing to EuroCCP in the Netherlands.  Cutting off Britain would, however, disrupt the operation of EU rules that ensure transparency in share trading.  EURO BONDS AND REPOS RETURN TO THEIR ROOTS  CME-owned BrokerTec, a bond and repurchase agreement (repo) trading platform, is moving its 210 billion-a-day euro-denominated trading to a new Amsterdam hub by March 18 to avoid splitting liquidity, even if there is a Brexit deal.  Likewise, MTS will shift Italian bond trading from London to Italy.  SPOT STAYS BUT FORWARDS FLEE  Spot forex trading is set to stay in London even if there is a no-deal Brexit.  But CME unit EBS is moving foreign-exchange forwards and swaps trading from London to Amsterdam by March 18, even if there is a Brexit deal.  Likewise, Refinitiv is transferring its $300 billion-a-day forex derivatives trading to Dublin from London, while leaving its $100 billion-a-day spot trading in London.  METALS IN FINE FETTLE FOR NOW  The London Metal Exchange has applied to German and Dutch regulators for dispensation from the requirement to be licensed as a foreign trading venue so that customers in those two countries can continue using the UK-based platform for trading copper, aluminum and other metals.  No such license is required in France, Cyprus, Ireland or Norway.  The EU has said if there is no deal, customers in the bloc could continue clearing their metals trades on LME for up to a year.  WHAT HAPPENED TO THE EURO CLEARING EXODUS?  London dominates euro-denominated derivatives clearing but it would be impossible to shift trillions of euros of contracts to the continent by March to avoid disruption from a no-deal Brexit that could threaten financial stability.  Brussels has acknowledged this by saying that in the event of a hard Brexit it would allow EU customers to continue using UK-based clearing houses like LCH until the end of 2020 to give more time to shift positions, and for rival clearers like Eurex in Frankfurt to build up capacity.  EU securities regulators and the Bank of England have also agreed a cooperation pact for supervising cross-border clearing operations.","96":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock exchange operator IEX Group on Tuesday challenged rival bourses to better justify the fees they charge brokers for market data, especially compared to the \u201cdramatic, and at times egregious\u201d difference to what it actually costs to produce.  The price of market data, which is essential information for trading and meeting the best execution obligations of brokers, has been a contentious issue for more than a decade and has recently come under greater regulatory scrutiny.  IEX, which operates the Investors Exchange, released a paper on Tuesday detailing its own costs to provide proprietary market data and exchange connectivity to its clients. It compared them to an extensive list of fees charged by Nasdaq Inc, Cboe Global Markets and New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc.  IEX, which has a market share of a little over 2.5 percent and does not charge for market data, said other exchanges charge 2,000 percent to 4,200 percent more for physical connectivity to their data centers than it costs IEX to offer comparable services.  It said that for \u201cdepth of book\u201d data products, which show bids and offers beyond the best prices, indicating supply and demand, other exchanges charged between 900 percent and 1,800 percent more than what it costs IEX to offer comparable products.  The \u201cmarkups charged by the three entrenched exchange operators are only possible in markets where exchanges have de facto monopoly control over products that many participants require to conduct their business,\u201d Brad Katsuyama, IEX\u2019s chief executive officer, said in a statement.  A Cboe spokeswoman declined comment. Spokespeople for NYSE and Nasdaq pointed to higher transaction fees on IEX.  \u201cWhile IEX is free to cherry pick and conflate their numbers, the fact remains that the all-in cost to trade on NYSE is lower than IEX,\u201d NYSE spokeswoman Kristen Kaus said.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has called for more transparency around market data costs specifically. The regulator held a heated industry roundtable on the topic in October.  Some market participants argued that while overall trading costs have declined in recent years, market data and exchange access fees have exploded.  \u201cMarket data costs are excessively high, they\u2019ve been growing at an abnormal rate relative to other technology, and it is clearly the exchanges leveraging what they have as almost monopoly power to be able to do that,\u201d Joe Wald, CEO of broker-dealer Clearpool, who participated in the SEC roundtable, said in an interview.","97":"(Updates with comment from Fidelity in fourth paragraph)  NEW YORK, Dec 4 (Reuters) - New cryptocurrency exchange ErisX said Tuesday it raised a total of $27.5 million from investors including Fidelity Investments and Nasdaq Ventures.

People walk by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Global Markets headquarters building in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., September 19, 2018. REUTERS\/Michael Hirtzer  WHAT IS THE VIX?  The VIX is a measure of expected 30-day volatility for U.S. stocks based on options on the S&P 500 Index .SPX.  VIX derivatives, such as futures and options, expire on the third or fourth Wednesday of every month and their final value is determined by the VIX\u2019s monthly settlement, calculated on expiration day.  The VIX settlement price is calculated using actual opening trade price of a subset of S&P options. If there is no opening traded price for an option included in the calculation, an average of that option\u2019s bid and ask price is used.  WHAT IS THE CRITICISM?  Traders in volatility products have long debated whether the settlement calculation can be influenced by someone artificially raising the price of the options going into the calculation.  These suspicions gained credence in May 2017, when John Griffin and Amin Shams of the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas, Austin, published a paper noting significant spikes in trading volume in S&P 500 index options at the time of the VIX settlement.  Their research showed that just prior to the settlement, there were instances of large option buy or sell orders that did not occur at other times.  While the paper did not rule out all benign explanations, it said: \u201cThe aggregate evidence aligns itself with what one would expect to see in the case of market manipulation of certain settlements.\u201d  Since the paper was published, more than a dozen lawsuits have been filed by various traders who say they lost money due to the alleged manipulation. In general, the lawsuits allege that various parties manipulated the VIX by placing S&P options orders with the intention to move the VIX settlement price.  WHAT IS CBOE\u2019S RESPONSE?  The Cboe says that the jump in trading volume in S&P 500 index options around settlement does not necessarily point to manipulation.  One explanation for the spike in activity could be that traders, who own VIX derivatives about to expire, may be trying to replace the volatility exposure with S&P options.  The exchange says it has since increased the number of participants who can take part in the settlement auction to improve liquidity.  Orderly auctions in recent months soothed some nerves, but investors will be watching future settlements to gauge if the fix is working.  DOES THE VIX NEED FIXING?  Some market participants have suggested that merely increasing liquidity or better policing the settlement auction might not be enough. The Cboe may need to change the VIX formula itself, they say.  The VIX\u2019s reliance on a wide range of traded options, rather than just the ones closest to where the market is trading, leaves the door open to manipulation, they say.  Some traders can influence the settlement price by simply buying a lot of certain S&P options that otherwise would not attract any trading and not be included in the calculation of the VIX price, they argue.","102":"NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court ruled on Tuesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission cannot force stock exchanges to conduct a costly experiment to see how the fees they charge and the incentives they offer affect brokers\u2019 trading habits.  The SEC\u2019s \u201cTransaction Fee Pilot\u201d aimed to shed light on how lucrative rebate payments from exchanges to brokers for stock orders that others can trade against influence the brokers\u2019 behavior.  Critics of the practice, including institutional investors managing tens of trillions of dollars, said the payments create conflicts of interest by incentivizing brokers to send customer orders to exchanges that pay the biggest rebates rather than to those that would obtain the best results for the end clients.  Intercontinental Exchange Inc\u2019s NYSE, Nasdaq Inc , and Cboe Global Markets Inc sued the SEC over the pilot program, arguing that the rebates are needed to compensate brokers for providing liquidity and that the SEC has not shown that they harm the market.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit sided with the exchanges, which also said that without rebates, bid-ask spreads would widen, making it more costly to trade.  \u201cThe Pilot Program emanates from an aimless \u2018one-off\u2019 regulation, i.e., a rule that imposes significant, costly, and disparate regulatory requirements on affected parties merely to allow the Commission to collect data to determine whether there might be a problem worthy of regulation,\u201d the court said.  The pilot program, which was recommended by the an SEC-appointed committee of market experts as well as the U.S. Treasury in a report in late 2017, would have in some cases banned the rebates altogether for certain stocks and lowered exchange transaction fees for others.  \u201cThis was an unprecedented action that clearly exceeded the SEC\u2019s authority under the Exchange Act,\u201d the appeals court ruling said.

Drawing from consultations with market participants, as well as its experience operating a venture exchange in the Nordics, Nasdaq said it would also seek regulatory relief to relax trading and disclosure rules for companies with thinly-traded shares.  For instance, exempting thinly-traded stocks from a rule that says trades must happen at the best displayed bid or offer in the market, would allow the exchange operator to use on-demand auctions to further pool liquidity.

That\u2019s why at 12:00:00 ET today, we stand with you @NYSE @Nasdaq @CBOE in an 8 minute and 46 second moment of silence in remembrance of George Floyd. #BlackLivesMatter,\u201d IEX posted on Twitter.  On Monday, thousands of mourners paid their respects to Floyd, filing past his open coffin in Houston, where Floyd grew up.  More anti-racism rallies inspired by his treatment were set to take place in the United States and Europe.  \u201cOur nation is in pain right now. So we cannot minimize that pain. It\u2019s really critical that we find solutions,\u201d Cunningham said.  Recent moments of silence by U.S. exchanges have included Aug. 5, in memory of the victims of mass shootings in Texas, Ohio, and California; as well as a yearly commemoration of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

FILE PHOTO: A worker looks at their phone as they walk past The Gherkin, Lloyds, and other office buildings in the City of London, Britain November 13, 2018. REUTERS\/Toby Melville\/File Photo  The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) stunned exchanges last month when it said that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, 6,200 mostly EU-listed shares, but also 14 UK stocks, could only be traded on platforms inside the bloc.  London is Europe\u2019s biggest share trading center and is used by fund managers from across the continent, who would be forced to accept less attractive prices if cut off from Britain.  \u201cThe good thing is that ESMA has taken a decision. Sometimes you see that in other places it is difficult to have a decision,\u201d said Sebastien Raspiller, head of the financial sector department at France\u2019s finance ministry.  \u201cThe bad news is that the decision was not good, so I hope that ESMA would be able to reconsider its position,\u201d Raspiller told the annual meeting of derivatives industry body ISDA in Hong Kong.  ESMA declined to comment.  Britain\u2019s markets watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), now has to decide whether to reciprocate with its own ban on trading UK and even some liquid EU shares outside the United Kingdom.  \u201cI can\u2019t rule it out,\u201d FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey told reporters in Washington.  \u201cWe have to solve the issue in the short term. We are in very close contact with ESMA on that.\u201d  ESMA\u2019s so-called \u201cshare trading obligation\u201d decision has been described by some industry officials as a \u201cland grab\u201d by an EU keen to build its own capital markets as Britain leaves the bloc.  EFAMA, the European funds industry body, said it has called on the EU\u2019s executive, the European Commission, to grant trading platforms in London access to EU customers in the event of a no-deal Brexit to avoid \u201cnegative implications\u201d for asset managers and end investors.  Pan-European share trading platforms Cboe, Turquoise (part of the London Stock Exchange) and Aquis Exchange have had to change their no-deal Brexit plans in recent days following ESMA\u2019s ruling, warning that splitting trading liquidity would hurt investors.  Bailey said the best solution is for the EU to grant \u201ctemporary equivalence\u201d or allowing cross-border share trading to continue for a fixed period after a no-deal Brexit - a step the EU has already indicated for clearing derivatives.  \u201cWe should live in a world where we do not have share trading obligations. People should decide where they want to trade,\u201d Bailey said.  British Prime Minister Theresa May is asking EU leaders on Wednesday for a further delay to Brexit until at least the end of June, and Raspiller said uncertainty over Brexit was damaging for market participants.","109":"Representations of the Ripple, Bitcoin, Etherum and Litecoin virtual currencies are seen on a PC motherboard in this illustration picture, February 14, 2018.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Alasdair Haynes, CEO of the London-based Aquis exchange AQX.L, said the EU should grant a year's extension to allow the SIX Exchange in Zurich to serve investors across the bloc.  If denied this permission known as equivalence, Switzerland, which is not a member of the EU, has said it would retaliate by banning the trading of Swiss shares on platforms in the EU.  \u201cWe are lobbying very aggressively for equivalence to be granted, even if extended by another year. It\u2019s incredibly disappointing to see that politics is playing a part here,\u201d Haynes told Reuters.  The bulk of trading in Swiss shares like heavyweights Nestle, Novartis, Roche and UBS takes place in Zurich, which would lose some business if equivalence was denied.  Significant amounts are also traded on rival platforms in the EU, such as Aquis, Cboe Europe CBOE.Z and the London Stock Exchange's (LSE) LSE.L Turquoise, meaning they could lose business as well due to the Swiss tit-for-tat ban.  Haynes said equivalence should be granted by the EU\u2019s executive European Commission if the Swiss Exchange fulfils all the technical requirements for that, which he believes it does.  Equivalence was only granted for a year so Brussels could work out its future relationship with another financial center, Britain, which is leaving the EU next March, Haynes said.  Given there is still uncertainty over Brexit, equivalence ought to be granted to the Swiss for another year, he added.  \u201cWe are monitoring the situation on a daily basis,\u201d Haynes said. Aquis trades 5 percent of Swiss shares in Europe.  Mark Hemsley, president of Cboe Europe, which trades over 20 percent of Swiss shares, said the EU could end up extending permission to Switzerland at the last moment.  \u201cI am prepared for the fact that we may not be trading Swiss stocks in the first three months of next year, but the way these things have been left, everyone is leaving every possible door open until the last minute,\u201d Hemsley told Reuters.  Once Britain has left the EU next March, it and Switzerland could in theory agree that Swiss shares resume trading on platforms in London, Hemsley added.  The LSE declined to comment.

REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  Earlier this month, glitches at Euronext ENX.PA impacted trading in several European countries and a hardware failure at the Tokyo Stock Exchange .TOPX caused the worst-ever outage for the world's third-largest equity market. In August, cyberattacks hit New Zealand's stock exchange NZX.NZ, and in July, a Deutsche Boerse DB1Gn.DE trading platform was briefly hobbled for the second time since April.  Market malfunctions - there have been many here in recent years - can erode investor confidence, and exchange operators say they have taken measures to ensure they can handle a potential election-related spike in volatility.  \"This thing could take days, weeks, months, so we embarked on a journey of increasing our capacity by multiple times,\" Kevin Kennedy, head of U.S. options at Nasdaq Inc NDAQ.O, said of the potential for drawn-out election results and his firm's preparations.  Nasdaq executives began looking ahead to the Nov. 3 election in March after the coronavirus pandemic whipsawed markets and sent trading volumes soaring, he said.  The decision to boost capacity came after the number of stock trades at Nasdaq in March soared to two-and-a-half times their 2019 peaks, while options volumes tripled, said Tal Cohen, head of the exchange operator\u2019s North American markets.  Nasdaq\u2019s systems performed without a hitch during the March trading surge, he added.  That was not the case across the industry.  Robinhood, the fintech startup credited with helping introduce a new generation of investors to trading through its app, has experienced several outages since early March, particularly on high-volume days.  The Silicon Valley-based brokerage said its priority is to ensure its platform performs as its customers need and expect it to, when asked what steps it has taken ahead of the election.  \u201cThis year, our engineering teams have worked diligently to further harden our infrastructure, improve reliability, and increase capacity,\u201d said a Robinhood spokeswoman.

In addition, we are communicating with clients about our election-related education and commentary,\u201d said a Schwab spokeswoman.  Exchange operator Cboe Global Markets, which had no issues during the coronavirus-driven volume surge, said its testing has shown it is ready to handle \u201canticipated increased volatility around the U.S. presidential election.\u201d  Still, Cboe said it increased the size of its Chicago-based trading floor to accommodate additional market makers and brokers.  \u201cThis was done to ensure adequate liquidity and broker coverage in anticipation of potential expanded volumes and volatility around the election,\u201d said a Cboe spokeswoman.  Intercontinental Exchange Inc's ICE.N New York Stock Exchange said it does regular testing but has not taken any special election-related measures.  Unrelated to the election, exchanges, along with banks, large brokers and market utilities, held an industrywide business continuity and disaster recovery plan test this past weekend to show they could operate from their backup sites in the case of an emergency.  Overseas, Deutsche Boerse said its systems have enough capacity to handle heavy transaction loads, and that it has not put in place any new measures prior to the U.S. elections.  Euronext said its recent outage was due to a \u201ctechnical issue affecting a third-party component,\u201d and that its systems handled the high volumes earlier this year without incident.","114":"June 2 (Reuters) - Cboe Global Markets Inc:  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS ACQUIRES TRADE ALERT, ADDING REAL-TIME ALERTS AND ANALYTICS TO INFORMATION SOLUTIONS OFFERING  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS INC - TERMS OF DEAL WERE NOT DISCLOSED  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS INC - FUNDED ACQUISITION WITH CASH ON HAND  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS INC - CONSIDERS ITS ACQUISITION OF TRADE ALERT BUSINESS TO BE NOMINALLY ACCRETIVE FOR 2020  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS INC - OPTIMISTIC ABOUT POTENTIAL FOR GROWTH GOING FORWARD FOR TRADE ALERT BUSINESS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","115":"LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s financial watchdog will wait at least until a European Union summit this month before deciding on its rules for trading EU-listed shares in London from January.

Turquoise, Cboe Europe and Aquis Exchange are among the platforms which offer one-stop trading both in shares listed in Britain and from across the EU.  EU states this week discussed their so-called share trading obligation (STO) which sets out where EU-based brokers must trade EU-listed shares from January.

The value of the net long dollar position was $32.30 billion in the week ended April 2, compared with $29.25 billion the previous week. U.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the Japanese yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars. In a broader measure of dollar positioning that includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian ruble, the U.S. dollar posted a net long position of $27.68 billion in the week ended April 2, compared with $24.22 billion the previous week. Despite the Federal Reserve's shift toward holding off on interest rate hikes, the dollar has held steady, boosted by data that showed generally stable growth for the world's largest economy. The dollar's fortunes have also been helped by Britain's woes in its planned exit from the European Union, with investors buying the greenback as a safe-haven currency. Britain could ask the European Union for a long Brexit delay next week if crisis talks between Prime Minister Theresa May's government and the opposition Labor Party fail to find a way out of the impasse over Brexit. The euro has struggled, benefiting the dollar, as the European Central Bank also took a dovish turn by restarting its stimulus program last month through a new round of cheap loans to banks. The dollar index so far this year was up 1.2 percent, after gains of 4.4 percent in 2018. In the cryptocurrency market, speculators' net short position on bitcoin Cboe futures further increased to 1,343 contracts in the week ended April 2, from 1,244 short contracts the previous week. Cboe Global Markets, however, said last month it no longer planned to offer bitcoin futures contracts, as the exchange operator reassesses its plans for trading digital asset derivatives amid slumping volumes. Currently listed Cboe XBT futures contracts, which expire in June, remain available for trading, Cboe said. Bitcoin though has started to creep higher, hitting a roughly five-month high of $5,345 early this week on the Bitstamp platform, after a major order by an anonymous buyer set off a frenzy of computer-driven trading, analysts said.

LJM invested in complex derivatives that lost most of their value over two days in early February 2018 following the biggest-ever single-day jump in the VIX volatility index . LJM later returned what remained of clients\u2019 money.  The Chicago-based fund manager was one of the largest casualties of the spike in volatility, which wiped out several derivative-linked investments that had delivered profits in calmer markets.  The losses have prompted more than two dozen lawsuits from various traders and firms that say they lost money due to manipulation of the VIX, the widely followed \u201cfear gauge\u201d that acts as a barometer of future expected swings in the S&P 500 stock index.  In its lawsuit, filed in federal court in Chicago, LJM said it wants Cboe Global Markets Inc, which owns the VIX index, to unveil the identities of parties it believes were responsible for manipulating the index and crashing the market.  Cboe, which is not a party to the lawsuit, declined comment. It has previously said it monitors markets to identify problems.  The lawsuit alleges that when the S&P 500 fell 4.1 percent on Feb. 5 last year, unnamed parties posted inflated prices for related options, boosting the VIX to benefit positions they held in VIX-linked products.  Those actions lifted the VIX and affected the price of other financial instruments that move in tandem with the options, including some traded by LJM. LJM said it was forced to trade in the instruments at artificial prices and suffered millions of dollars in losses as a result.  LJM said in the lawsuit that it had the right to obtain the identities of parties it believed to have manipulated the market from Cboe.  The fund manager filed an earlier claim blaming its VIX-related losses on the actions of its broker, a Wells Fargo & Co unit, which it said forced the unwinding of its portfolio at a disadvantageous time.  Wells Fargo, which asked a court for help retrieving $16.4 million from LJM, denied those claims. A judge dismissed LJM\u2019s claims against Wells Fargo in September but the fund manager has asked the court to reconsider.  The case is LJM Partners Ltd v.

The mini futures will be a tenth of the size of VIX futures but will have the same settlement dates, the exchange, which is owned by Cboe Global Markets, said in its filing here with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  VIX futures are commonly used to hedge against market declines, such as March\u2019s plunge in U.S. stocks that signaled the end of a nearly 11-year-old bull market.

On Thursday, CBOE Global Markets CBOE.Z said it would suspend open-outcry trading and move to an electronic-only mode until further notice as a precautionary measure.  On Friday, the NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc ICE.N, issued a trader alert that it aims to keep its equity and options trading floors open \"in the days and weeks ahead,\" even as it asked its staff at 11 Wall Street, not needed to support floor trading, to work from home amid coronavirus concerns.  For its part, the Nasdaq NDAQ.O issued a statement on Sunday that all electronic Nasdaq-operated equities, options, and fixed income markets will remain in operation and Nasdaq PHLX Options trading floor in Philadelphia will temporarily close on Tuesday as it moves to an electronic-only environment.  From the government perspective, U.S. markets should stay open despite the intense volatility, said Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Jay Clayton in a phone interview with CNBC network on Monday.  There have been six extended closings of the NYSE of at least one day or more since 1885, a person at the exchange confirmed. Below is a list and the reason for each.  March 12-13, 1888 - Blizzard of 1888  July 31-Nov 27, 1914 - Pending start of WWI  July 14, 1977 - New York City blackout  Sept, 27, 1985 - Hurricane Gloria  Sept 11-14, 2001 - Attack on World Trade Center  Oct 29-30, 2012 - Hurricane Sandy","126":"(Repeats Oct. 12 item with no changes to text)  NEW YORK, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Months after he lost millions when an esoteric corner of financial markets cratered in February, former Target Corp store manager Seth Golden is betting against volatility again.  Golden, who says wagers on market calm earned him millions in the past six years, is among the investors who have kept trading complex financial products linked to the Cboe Volatility Index - Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge\u201d - in the months since some of those products blew up.  \u201cThe majority of \u2018vol sellers\u2019 were not damaged in February. It was the Johnny-come-latelies and people who shouldn\u2019t have been trading volatility in the first place,\u201d Golden said.  This market is back in focus after another rapid stock market slide pushed VIX to as high as 29 from early October lows under 12, and given a gradual rebuilding of trades betting the volatility will not last.  While many investors smarted, others kept coming and between March and September, more than $1.2 billion rolled into U.S.-based exchange-traded volatility products, according to Reuters calculations based on data from FactSet Research Systems Inc, which tracks the investments.  That compares with $1.7 billion the month before the early February \u201cVolmaggedon\u201d when stocks sold-off briefly on fleeting inflation fears, the VIX shot up to 50 on Feb. 6 from 18 the day before, and some investors lost over 90 percent of their investment.  Golden, who gained prominence after the New York Times profiled him in 2017 and now runs a website that offers advice to traders, said that he had already more than recovered his February losses as he kept borrowing VIX exchange-traded products, selling them and buying them back when the price goes down. Reuters could not independently verify his accounting.  Golden said he cashed in some of his profits before the latest volatility spike and now was waiting for the market to reverse to get back in.  \u201cThese are the days I live for,\u201d he said during the market selloff this week.  The February crash sparked a debate whether the VIX index and the related products were prone to manipulation and led to dozens of lawsuits and ongoing probes into the matter by U.S. regulators.  LESS LEVERAGE  Since then, both the Cboe exchange, which owns the VIX index, and issuers of some of the related products have made changes they say should make the market less prone to violent, hard-to-anticipate swings.  The exchange has modified its auctions that determine the price of VIX futures to boost liquidity while the backers of some of the volatility products tweaked them to reduce leverage.  For example, ProShare Capital Management LLC, backers of the widely used ProShares-brand vol products, restructured one product so it would aim to move less in response to changes in the market, losing 0.5 percent, instead of 1 percent, when the index it tracks increases by 1 percent.  So far, those steps seem to have worked.  The $370 million ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF , which tumbled over 80 percent in a single day in February, sank 8.3 percent on Wednesday, lost 4.6 percent on Thursday and rebounded 3 percent on Friday morning.  Early this month, Barclays Plc analysts who argued the February plunge was \u201ctechnical in nature\u201d wrote that a strong U.S. economy and so far limited economic impact from trade conflicts, emerging market currency declines and upcoming congressional elections should support the short-vol trade.  This week, however, they said their views have changed given an increased chance of a Federal Reserve policy misstep and investors\u2019 increased focus on the effects of a trade war between the United States and China.  \u201cWe expect volatility to remain elevated in the short term and do not recommend buying this dip,\u201d they wrote.  \u201cThe difference is that this time there are some genuine catalysts we can point to,\u201d one of the authors, Maneesh Deshpande, told Reuters.  While investors trade VIX futures to guard against market declines and turmoil, those derivatives have a tendency to lose value in steadily rising markets as demand for such protection declines. Inverse-vol products launched and listed on exchanges after the 2007-2009 financial crisis allowed investors to take advantage of that and profit during extended spells of market calm.  Originally designed as a sophisticated hedging tool for professional investors to help manage their daily market exposure, inverse-volatility products became popular among small investors when the products listed on exchanges and took on a new life as a lucrative bet on market calm.  Gains of nearly 600 percent over two years up to February vaulted the products onto various lists of top performing investments and made them the subject of excited conversation on social media and financial websites.  \u201cThe pros, a lot of them were right back in there a week or two after February,\u201d said Russell Rhoads, head of derivatives research at TABB Group LLC.  \u201cThere\u2019s lots of people trying to pick stocks. The major hedge funds are all doing the same thing, and the volatility space has opened things up for people that are willing to do the work to find a new way to speculate on the market.\u201d  Some analysts blamed the severity of the crash in part on excessive leverage and over-confidence of ill-prepared retail investors.  \u201cIt\u2019s more or less a substitute for going to Las Vegas - you can do it from your home office,\u201d said Robert Whaley, a professor at Vanderbilt University who developed VIX.  Whaley stands by VIX as a market gauge but is concerned that volatility-themed exchange-traded products pose risk to retail investors.  There is no record of how many retail investors are in the trade, but available data suggests they still play a sizeable role in the market.  Institutions required to report certain holdings, typically traders and fund managers overseeing more than $100 million, account for between 3 percent and 62 percent of U.S. volatility exchange-traded funds\u2019 assets, with the balance held by those who do not make such filings, including smaller funds and retail investors, Refinitiv data shows.  Stuart Barton, managing partner at Invest in Vol LLC, an investment adviser, which uses the products, said those investors are taking big risks again.  \u201cThe moves by the surviving products to lower their leverage has been a good move but that\u2019s only half the story,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople just take twice the position.\u201d","127":"Feb 8 (Reuters) - Cboe Global Markets Inc:  * ADJUSTED DILUTED EPS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF $1.54  * SEES 2019 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO BE $50 TO $55 MILLION  * Q4 EARNINGS PER SHARE $1.23  * NET REVENUE FOR Q4 OF $334.4 MILLION, UP 26 PERCENT  * ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE 2020 RUN-RATE SYNERGY TARGET OF $85 MILLION  * EXITED 2018 WITH RUN-RATE SYNERGIES OF $57 MILLION  * SEES 2019 ADJUSTED OPERATING EXPENSES TO BE $420 TO $428 MILLION  * SEES 2019 ADJUSTED OPERATING EXPENSES IN A RANGE OF $420 MILLION TO $428 MILLION  * QTRLY TOTAL COMPANY OPTIONS ADV 8.6 MILLION VERSUS ABOUT 7 MILLION REPORTED LAST YEAR  * SEES 2019 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO BE IN THE RANGE OF $50 MILLION TO $55 MILLION  * SEES 2019 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON ADJUSTED EARNINGS TO BE 27 TO 29 PERCENT  * QTRLY TOTAL FUTURES ADV 338,000 VERSUS 285,000 REPORTED LAST YEAR  * AT DECEMBER 31, 2018, HAD ADJUSTED CASH AND FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS OF $257.7 MILLION  * Q4 EARNINGS PER SHARE VIEW $1.37, REVENUE VIEW $324.9 MILLION -- REFINITIV IBES DATA Source text: (bit.ly\/2SiGAu9) Further company coverage:","128":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - At least three new U.S. stock exchanges are expected in 2020, executives from the companies said on Thursday, potentially lowering trading costs as the upstarts try to take business from the incumbents, while also adding complexity to the marketplace.

The increased competition comes as NYSE, Nasdaq and Cboe sue the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to prevent an experiment mandated by the regulator to test lowering exchange fees and curtailing payments to brokers for orders.  It also comes amid an intense debate between the large exchange operators and their customers over fees for things like market data and connectivity.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to start out 40 percent cheaper than the lowest cost operator today,\u201d said Thomas Gallagher, chief executive officer of Miami International Holdings.

REUTERS\/Simon Dawson  The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), a banking industry body, and UK-based Investment Association (IA), which represents asset managers, said Europe had some of the longest trading hours in the world at 8-1\/2 hours.  This compares with 6-1\/2 hours on Wall Street and 6 hours in Asia, the two industry bodies said in a joint statement on Thursday.  AFME and IA, whose members including Goldman Sachs, Barclays, BlackRock and BNP Paribas account for the bulk of share trading, said they were talking with major European exchanges to explore cutting the trading day by 90 minutes.  The opening bell would be rung at 0900 GMT, an hour later than at present, with the close 30 minutes earlier at 1600 GMT.  The first hour of trading currently attracts light volumes, making it more costly to trade, with over a third of trading in the final hour.  \u201cShortening the hours would concentrate liquidity leading to more consistent trading costs and provide greater time for traders and the market to digest corporate announcements,\u201d AFME and IA said.  Long hours affect the mental health and wellbeing of traders and are a key obstacle to recruiting more diverse staff, in particular for those with family or caring commitments, they added.  The Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates share trading, said last month the number of women in senior financial roles had flat-lined since 2005 despite the sector\u2019s \u201crhetoric\u201d on diversity, with brokers the worst.  The London Stock Exchange said it strongly supported improving diversity and workplace culture, and intended to consider the request in a formal consultation with members and users.  Euronext said it was willing to start a dialogue with members, listed companies and fund managers on the issue that is said involved quality of life and the competitiveness of Europe.  Deutsche Boerse declined to comment.  FIT FOR PURPOSE  Share trading in Europe already faces fragmentation due to Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, and differences in trading hours could accentuate any divide.  Rainer Riess, director general of the Federation of European Securities Exchanges, said Europe\u2019s current trading hours were \u201cfit for purpose\u201d and should not be revisited.  \u201cA reduction of trading hours in Europe would give an advantage to other jurisdictions in similar or equivalent time zones to expand their trading hours,\u201d Riess said.  Existing hours reflect investor needs, allow European markets to interact with the United States and Asia, Riess said.  Cboe, Europe\u2019s biggest cross-border exchange, said it would likely make the most sense to shorten sessions at the beginning of the day given they do not overlap with the U.S. market.  Aquis Exchange said that, while it welcomed steps to improve markets, cutting trading hours was not the most effective way of boosting diversity or the number of women.","132":"ZURICH, June 24 (Reuters) - The Swiss government said on Monday it was ready to ban stock exchanges in the European Union from trading Swiss shares - intensifying a row over a stalled partnership treaty.

In response Bern said it would withdraw recognition from trading venues in the EU from July 1 to \u201cprotect the Swiss stock exchange infrastructure in the event of non-extension.\u201d  \u201cTrading venues in the EU would thus be prohibited from offering or facilitating trading in certain shares of Swiss companies from that date,\u201d the Swiss government said in a statement.","133":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock exchanges have put New Jersey on notice: Pass a financial transaction tax and they will relocate their primary data centers, where billions of dollars of trades are executed daily - possibly to Chicago.  FILE PHOTO: A U.S. dollar note is seen in front of a stock graph in this November 7, 2016 picture illustration. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  A move to the Windy City wouldn\u2019t just save millions in annual tax dollars. It could also help level the playing field for market participants by making lightning-fast price changes harder to exploit by high-speed traders and promote deeper liquidity, industry members said.  That\u2019s because all 16 U.S. stock exchanges have their disaster recovery sites in the same building at 350 East Cermak Road in Chicago, as opposed to their main sites, which currently reside in three data centers spread across a 50-mile swath of northern New Jersey.  In the electronic trading world, the physical distance a signal must travel is a key factor in how long it takes to get an order filled, and the race to get the best prices is one in which nanoseconds matter.  Moving to the Chicago site would reduce the possibility for latency arbitrage, where firms detect a trade on one exchange and then use microwave or laser technology and sophisticated algorithms to race to the other exchanges, executing trades and booking profits before those exchanges can update their prices.  \u201cA lot of investments in fast infrastructure would become obsolete and a lot of trading strategies on that side would be eliminated,\u201d said Jack Miller, head of trading at Robert W. Baird & Co.  Reducing latency arbitrage would make it easier for market participants to complete trades at their desired price, said a senior exchange executive who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. That would encourage larger displayed trade sizes with tighter spreads between the price at which an asset is being offered and the price for which it is being sold, improving overall liquidity, the person added.  \u201cHaving all exchanges in one geographic location would be healthier for liquidity in our markets,\u201d said another senior industry executive.  SHOT ACROSS THE BOW  The backup to the U.S. stock market is in an eight-story English gothic-style building just off Lake Michigan, in the shadow of Chicago\u2019s sprawling McCormick Place Convention Center, that hosts several data centers.  This week, Intercontinental Exchange Inc's ICE.N New York Stock Exchange unit is running the smallest of its five exchanges, NYSE Chicago, live from the location to show its readiness to move. Nasdaq Inc NDAQ.O plans to do the same with its smallest exchange for a week in late October.  All 16 exchanges were also in Chicago this past weekend for an industry-wide exercise simulating a regular trading day, in part to show they could operate from their disaster recovery sites in an emergency.  But the exchanges also wanted to send a message to New Jersey, which is considering a state tax of a quarter of a cent per financial transaction for firms that make more than 10,000 such transactions per year.  \u201cThe tests are a first step toward demonstrating industry preparedness to move data centers out of New Jersey and protect millions of market participants across the U.S. from New Jersey\u2019s invasive proposed tax,\u201d said the Coalition to Prevent the Taxing of Retirement Savings.  The tax is under review by the state\u2019s Senate, Assembly and its governor, said Richard McGrath, a spokesperson for New Jersey\u2019s Senate president, Stephen Sweeney, who introduced one of two bills proposing the levy.  The coalition represents exchange operators NYSE, Nasdaq, Cboe Global Markets CBOE.Z, IEX Group and the Members Exchange, as well as financial firms TD Ameritrade AMTD.O, UBS UBSG.S, Credit Suisse CSGN.S, Citadel Securities, Virtu Financial VIRT.O and data center operator Equinix EQIX.O.  \u201cThey\u2019re basically firing a very strong shot across the bow of the people trying to impose a local transaction tax, by signaling, we can literally move everything out of state overnight,\u201d said James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University.","134":"May 26 (Reuters) - Exchange operator Cboe Global Markets said on Tuesday it plans to reopen its options trading floor in Chicago and resume trading operations on the floor on June 8.

The exchanges were accused of violating federal securities law by developing and selling high-priced services to provide advantages to favored high-frequency trading customers, while concealing these services from ordinary investors.

With just over two months before Brexit day on March 29, Aquis and rivals Cboe and Turquoise are racing to get approval for EU hubs that would help them cope in the event of a disorderly departure.  Britain has yet to agree withdrawal terms with the EU, which are vital for cross-border trading to continue uninterrupted.

Sector leader Cboe Europe, and the London Stock Exchange\u2019s Turquoise have yet to obtain a licence for new hubs in Amsterdam.  While the number of jobs relocating from London to the new hubs will be modest, large volumes of euro-denominated share trading is expected to shift out of Britain.  London hubs would then be left trading UK and Swiss shares.  Mark Hemsley, president of Cboe Europe, said he expected EU-based users of Cboe Europe - and UK users like banks which have opened EU hubs themselves - to trade in Amsterdam instead of London.  \u201cWe are going to put the EU27 stocks in Amsterdam, and the Swiss and UK stocks in the UK. What we are trying to do is keep the liquidity together,\u201d Hemsley told reporters on Wednesday.  The shift in share trading could be paralleled by moves in clearing from London to venues such as EuroCCP in the Netherlands, exchange officials said.  The move in euro share trading also mirrors the fixed income market where CME\u2019s BrokerTec is moving all trading in euro-denominated bonds from London to Amsterdam to avoid splitting up liquidity.  The London Stock Exchange will move its MTS euro-denominated government bond trading from London to Italy by March.

Hopes were high that Prime Minister Boris Johnson would prioritise the financial sector -- Britain\u2019s largest export industry and biggest corporate tax generator -- in trade talks.  But bank sources say a push by the EU for fishing access to UK waters and London\u2019s stance that it will diverge from EU rules are prompting them to review hard-Brexit plans that could see more jobs than anticipated move to Europe.  Until now, financial firms running EU operations from Britain believed that technical assessments by EU banking, insurance and markets regulators would be enough judge UK rules \u2018equivalent\u2019 to those governing EU-based firms, granting them market access after December.  But banking sources say the EU\u2019s executive now sees things differently.  Sources from three international banks fear that access will depend on a broader trade-off such as Britain allowing fishing in its waters -- a concession they feel the government is reluctant to make.  \u201cWe\u2019re now hearing very explicitly -- it\u2019s not even the rumour mill -- the European Commission has said these are politically linked to progress in phase-two negotiations,\u201d one banking source told Reuters.  \u201cAs one official put it to me, if \u2018fish for financial services\u2019 is going badly, this will impact the Commission\u2019s willingness to grant equivalence.\u201d  The fishing industry is valued at about 169 times less than financial services and official data shows it employs just 8,000 people compared to more than a million in finance.  But regaining control of Britain\u2019s rich fishing waters was a totem for Brexit campaigners.  A European Commission spokesman referred to a January EU document saying the bloc and Britain should endeavour to complete equivalence assessments before June 30. He declined to comment further.  The EU is Britain\u2019s biggest financial services export market, worth about 26 billion pounds annually.  Since the 2016 Brexit vote, the sector has reorganised to preserve a foothold in the EU, launching or beefing up subsidiaries and relocating staff and capital. Many banks and money managers are preparing for a further transfer of resources after a transition period ends in December.  Consultants EY said this week that around 7,000 financial services jobs will move from Britain to staff new EU hubs.  Failing to obtain equivalence could add risk-management, compliance, middle and back office roles to that figure, as well as trading and client-facing jobs, the sources said.  Finance minister Sajid Javid said last week that Britain would not be a rule-taker after Brexit, even though some businesses could suffer from regulatory divergence.  He wants \u201coutcomes-based\u201d equivalence in financial services, meaning UK rules need not be identical to those in the EU but should have the same effect.  The EU updated its equivalence policy ahead of Brexit, saying third-country regimes like those in Japan and the United States do not need to be identical but must have the same \u201coutcomes\u201d as EU rules to give access to its markets.  But it would impose tougher scrutiny of \u201chigh-impact\u201d countries, expected to include Britain.  The EU\u2019s withdrawal of share trading equivalence from Switzerland during a dispute over a partnership treaty, not because of any divergence in rules, showed how equivalence can be politicised.  Britain\u2019s finance ministry had no immediate comment.  COST AND SCRUTINY  Bankers say jobs transferred to Europe as politicians wrangle are likely to stay there, even if equivalence is eventually granted.  \u201cThe sector\u2019s approach has always been to prepare in a way for the worst,\u201d a second senior banking source said.  Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing recognised the risk that a trade deal would not be finalised before end-2020.  He said his bank \u201ccould do everything out of Frankfurt\u201d but that Britain would remain an important capital market.  Financial lobby groups have warned that if Britain does not get equivalence, the government will lose valuable tax revenue.  The bloc is the biggest customer for Britain\u2019s financial services exports, worth about 26 billion pounds annually based on unfettered access.  But lawmakers from Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party say the City could cope with the fallout if negotiations turned sour.  \u201cLondon is a marketplace. The marketplace doesn\u2019t come to them (the EU) ... the health of the City doesn\u2019t depend nearly to the extent that is believed on having some privileged position in the EU,\u201d said Peter Lilley, who sits in parliament\u2019s upper chamber.  A second Conservative lawmaker, Tim Loughton, said Johnson would not consider swapping assets such as fishing rights to cut a better deal for banks, which have struggled to rebuild their image since the 2008 financial crisis.  He said the EU was bluffing and would not politicize financial services because it, too, risked losing access to the region\u2019s deepest markets.  \u201cIt would be a massive exercise in cutting off your nose to spite your face,\u201d he said.

The mini futures will be a 10th of the size of VIX futures but will have the same settlement dates, the exchange, which is owned by Cboe Global Markets CBOE.Z, said in its filing here with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. A launch date has not yet been set, but the exchange expects the mini futures to debut later this year.  VIX futures are commonly used to hedge against market declines, such as March\u2019s plunge in U.S. stocks that signaled the end of a nearly 11-year-old bull market.  Cboe previously offered mini VIX futures from March 2009 to February 2014. Since then, demand for VIX products has increased among retail investors, the exchange said. A smaller contract size would allow individual investors to buy such hedges at lower costs.  Standard VIX futures are not accessible to smaller accounts, said Matt Thompson, managing partner at Thompson Capital Management. At current prices for front-month contracts VXc1, for instance, a $250,000 account would have more than 10% of its funds allocated to a single contract.  \u201cThe main sticking point with the original contracts is that the size is pretty big, so you need larger accounts, and it\u2019s hard to fine-tune exposure like we want to,\u201d Thompson said.  Even before the March sell-off, investors had expressed interest in mini futures, but demand for such a product has accelerated amid recent market turmoil, said Matt McFarland, vice president and head of futures at Cboe Futures Exchange.  \u201cIt\u2019s market conditions like we just experienced where the utility of the VIX really demonstrates itself,\u201d he said.","145":"NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders may be surging in the polls ahead of Super Tuesday, but some on Wall Street have made their own conclusions on what November will bring: four more years of President Donald Trump.  Ninety-five percent of participants in a Deutsche Bank survey of investors, economists and other market participants released earlier this month said Trump, a Republican, was either \u201cextremely likely\u201d or \u201cslightly likely\u201d to win the general election.  Those results contrast with wider polls, which show any Democrat beating Trump in a presidential contest. The latest Reuters\/Ipsos poll, conducted Feb. 19-25, showed Sanders with a seven percentage-point lead over Trump in a hypothetical general election matchup.  The sharp mismatch in expectations could stoke market volatility if Wall Streeters are wrong and a Democrat emerges victorious--especially if that winner is Sanders, whose promises to break up big banks, take on drug companies and essentially abolish private insurance in favor of a single government-run plan have unnerved some investors. Many on Wall Street were unprepared for Trump\u2019s win in 2016, which was followed by sharp swings in asset prices.  \u201cAs an investor, I look at this and say the market\u2019s nightmare scenario is that Bernie or Elizabeth Warren wins the election,\u201d said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist, at Federated Investors, in New York. \u201cThat\u2019s not our base case ... but it\u2019s a concern,\u201d he said.  Warren\u2019s policy proposals, like Sanders\u2019s, have also jangled nerves on Wall Street.  Investors will be looking ahead to next Tuesday, when 14 states will cast ballots and Sanders could build an overwhelming advantage if he captures the lion\u2019s share of the available delegates.  Those primaries come as the markets are gripped by concerns over the economic fallout from the spreading coronavirus outbreak, with the number of cases beyond China accelerating rapidly. U.S. stocks plunged for a sixth day on Thursday and the S&P 500 confirmed its fastest correction in history.  Orlando said Sanders\u2019 rise in the polls also contributed to the recent sell-off. Some investors also said continued volatility in markets or an economic downturn could wear away at Trump\u2019s support.  While the market gyrations are likely to drown out some of the potential impact from next week\u2019s results, some corners are already feeling the effects of Sanders\u2019 recent success.  After Sanders\u2019 commanding victory in the Nevada caucuses in February, shares of insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc and Centene Corp sold off on what some analysts said were concerns over the potential nomination of a Sanders nomination.  \u201cIf Bernie runs the table and suddenly he becomes unstoppable, I think we\u2019re going to see the jitters again,\u201d said Teresa McRoberts, a portfolio manager focused on healthcare at Fred Alger Management in New York.  The effects on the broader market of a big Sanders win on Tuesday are less clear. Only 13% of participants in Deutsche Bank\u2019s poll believed Sanders could beat Trump in the general election, compared to 22% for former Vice President Joe Biden and 45% for former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, Texas, has kept most of his attention on the coronavirus outbreak in recent days and isn\u2019t eager to make any election-related portfolio moves yet.  \u201cI think most of my clients pretty much are like me, thinking Trump is going win,\u201d he said.  Still, some investors believe the election can fuel market swings this year.  Volume on the October futures contract for the Cboe Volatility Index hit 16,247 between Jan. 2 and Feb. 21, according to Cboe Global Markets. That dwarfs the 471 contracts that traded in 2016 from Jan. 4 to Feb. 19. VIX futures reflect expectations for volatility in the month following their expiration.  On Thursday, October VIX futures traded at 22.5, versus 19.57 for September futures and 20.22 for November futures, indicating heightened expectations for volatility near election day.  Cboe Global Markets listed October VIX futures a month earlier than usual in response to customers eager to place bets on election-induced volatility, said Kevin Davitt, senior instructor at the exchange\u2019s options institute. The exchange also listed September and November futures ahead of their usual schedule.  Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said the election will become a greater concern for investors once the Democratic party selects its nominee.  \u201cThere are a number of places where the policy divides are incredibly wide,\u201d he said.","146":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cboe Global Markets CBOE.Z will be ready to reopen its Cboe options trading floor as of June 1, but the reopening will depend on how safely the exchange operator can do so in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, Chief Executive Officer Ed Tilly said on Friday.  Cboe moved to fully electronic trading at the end of the trading day on March 13 in response to the threat posed by the fast-spreading virus, and since the floor closure, it has been more difficult for customers to get complex options trades done, Tilly said on a post-earnings conference call with analysts.","147":"LONDON, April 16 (Reuters) - Pan-European stock exchange Aquis said on Thursday it neared break-even in 2019, although the coronavirus pandemic could slow the pace at which it signs up new customers.  Aquis said it made an operating loss of 200,000 pounds ($249,500) in 2019, down 93% from 2018.  Market share in pan-European stocks trading rose to 4.6% from 3.8%, and it ended the year with 11 million pounds in cash and no debt, it said.  Aquis shares were up 6% at 362 pence at 1005 GMT,  Chief Executive Alasdair Haynes said the company will invest a million pounds in hiring more technology staff this year and therefore won\u2019t be profitable until 2021.  \u201cWe have to make a significant investment to gain more in the long term and that went down pretty well in the market,\u201d Haynes said.  Aquis competes with pan-European exchanges like Cboe , which has a market share of around 20%, and the London Stock Exchange\u2019s Turquoise platform.  It added three clients to reach 30 in 2019, a slower rate of increase than expected, with Haynes citing uncertainty over Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union and its impact on cross-border share trading.  \u201cWe were expecting to see substantial growth in clients this year but the coronavirus could cause a slowdown,\u201d Haynes said.  Many trading houses are having to work off-site or from home, with the lockdown in Britain expected to last until May at least, making it harder to physically connect new customers.  The total number of clients is likely to hit 40 during 2020 out of a pool of 80 to 100 potential clients.  Haynes said he was sticking with a market share target of 10%, though declined to give a target deadline.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time. We will reach 10%,\u201d Haynes said.  Broker Liberum said the 2019 results were ahead of expectations. \u201cWe note the significant increase in value traded on the exchange in February and March. This will lead to clients trading more and entering higher revenue tiers,\u201d it said.  Five EU countries renewed their bans on short-selling of shares on Wednesday, with Italy already having extended its ban.  \u201cIt\u2019s a case of damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t,\u201d Haynes said.  The bans have divided regulators with Britain and Germany not following suit, and triggered opposition from hedge funds and high-frequency traders (HFT) that favour short-selling strategies.  \u201cYou cannot have companies go bust due to exceptional circumstances,\u201d Haynes said.  Aquis does not allow HFT firms on its market and volumes dipped in March when they hit record levels at other exchanges.

Britain\u2019s access to the EU in financial services is being dealt with by Brussels separately from stalled negotiations that increasingly point to a no-deal Brexit on Dec. 31.  The EU has said that banks in the bloc must trade euro-denominated shares and a welter of derivatives inside the bloc from January.  \u201cSome business, as a result of that, will need to transfer. The question is, is the market ready, have people made the right preparations for that,\u201d Bank of England Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe told reporters.  \u201cThere may be some who are unprepared and in many cases there are other routes for them, but it\u2019s impossible to know unless and until we get there exactly what the impact will be,\u201d Cunliffe said.  Share-trading platforms in London have opened units in the bloc to trade euro-denominated shares, but banks warned on Thursday that disruption in derivatives was inevitable unless the EU granted market access to Britain before January.  Around $200 billion of daily trading in interest rate swaps in London, or roughly a sixth of the total, will be affected by \u201cobligations\u201d on where trading can take place, the BoE said.  Britain, however, has so far refused to soften its own obligation on UK-regulated banks to use derivatives platforms in London, making trades between UK and EU counterparties impossible.  But Bailey said the BoE has spent a lot of time mitigating potential disruption and avoiding market \u201croadblocks\u201d, without matching action from Brussels.  The BoE\u2019s full \u201carmoury\u201d will be at hand to deal with any market disruption in January, Bailey said.  The EU\u2019s financial services chief said this week the bloc needed to cut its reliance on the City of London.  \u201cLondon is a global financial centre, has been for a very, very long time, and will continue to be so,\u201d Bailey said.","151":"LONDON (Reuters) - British-based exchanges will once again offer trading in Swiss shares from next month, but it may take time to rebuild volumes, Britain\u2019s finance ministry and exchanges said on Friday.  The ministry has set out legislation in parliament that is expected to be approved quickly and allow platforms like Cboe, Aquis Exchange and London Stock Exchange\u2019s Turquoise to be able to offer trading in Swiss shares from or just after Feb. 3.  \u201cOnce in force, the Swiss State Secretariat for International Financial Matters (SIF) have indicated they will reciprocate by removing restrictions on UK trading venues,\u201d a spokesman for the British finance ministry said.  SIF said that once the British parliament approves the legislation, necessary steps will be taken on the Swiss side as soon as possible thereafter.  Brussels blocked European Union investors from trading on Swiss bourses in June 2019 after a treaty row, with Switzerland then banning EU exchanges from trading Swiss shares.  But Britain is no longer bound by EU rules since its full departure from the bloc on Dec. 31 and the British and Swiss authorities flagged their intentions in June with plans for a financial services agreement.  London platforms handled around 1.2 billion euros daily in Swiss shares or about 27% of the total volume in the run up to the EU ban, Cboe figures showed.  Swiss shares were Cboe\u2019s fourth biggest market, worth about 787 million euros a day in the first half of 2019, and Nick Dutton, its chief regulatory officer in Europe, said it was difficult to know if trading would return to June 2019 levels immediately.  \u201cOur participants are telling us they want it back, but it\u2019s not a given and we have to rebuild that liquidity,\u201d Dutton said.  The return of Swiss shares will only partly make up for the loss of 6.5 billion euros in daily trading of euro-denominated shares that left London for EU platforms on Jan. 4.  \u201cWe are expecting Swiss volumes to return to where they were on Aquis,\u201d said Alasdair Haynes, CEO of Aquis Exchange, adding this may not be straight away.","152":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - With money pouring in to assets linked to sustainable investing, exchange operators have increased their focus on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) business opportunities, which could get a boost from the policies of President-elect Joe Biden.  FILE PHOTO: A bull elk makes its way through the field as corn is harvested in Levan, Utah, October 5, 2013. REUTERS\/Jim Urquhart\/File Photo  Exchanges have increasingly been rolling out new ESG initiatives, including data products to help investors understand ESG risks; services aimed at helping corporations analyze ESG best practices, disclose their own practices, and attract capital; and ESG-focused benchmarks and derivatives.  \u201cExchanges sit in this unique nexus in between investors and companies and regulators,\u201d said Evan Harvey, Nasdaq Inc\u2019s global head of sustainability. \u201cAnd as all three of those groups are looking for the common sense ground on ESG reporting and transparency and performance measurement, exchanges have a role to play,\u201d he said.  Nasdaq expects ESG-related spending by U.S. companies to rise to $5 billion by 2025 from $500 million currently, and its executives said expanding ESG product offerings was a top business opportunity, during its investor day on Nov. 10.  The exchange operator has targeted $50 million in revenue from its new ESG services by 2025, versus $5 million now. That number rises to $150 million, or 5% of total revenue, when including all Nasdaq\u2019s ESG-related operations, like its governance platform, green bond platform, sustainable bond network, and ESG index platform, by 2025.  ESG has become big business for the investment industry. In U.S. equities, sustainable funds, which have outperformed standard funds, attracted inflows of $3.8 billion in the third quarter, compared with outflows of $118.5 billion overall for equity funds, according to Morningstar here.  With a 16% compound annual growth rate, ESG-mandated assets could make up half of all managed U.S. assets by 2025, according Deloitte here.  One tailwind for ESG could come from President-elect Biden, who made climate change a pillar of his election campaign.  Nasdaq is taking a wait-and-see approach on what the new administration will mean for ESG, Harvey said.  \u201cJust the attitude around sustainable investing and what, if anything, the government is going to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re eagerly observing that along with everyone else.\u201d  Exchange operators Cboe Global Markets and New York Stock Exchange-owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc, also said they are curious as to how the Biden administration will treat ESG.  \u201cThe attention is there and it\u2019s growing and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it accelerates further as we move into a new administration and into the next Congress,\u201d said Angelo Evangelou, Cboe\u2019s chief policy officer.  While Biden will likely advocate for a renewed focus on ESG, it is unclear how that will play out for the market, said Lynn Martin, ICE\u2019s president of fixed income and data services.  \u201cYou still need to have organic demand from the market, and clearly, being able to generate returns helps with organic demand,\u201d she said.  Demand for ICE\u2019s green bond index has grown because green bonds have outperformed other forms of debt this year, she said.  That type of outperformance, along with more public companies backing carbon reduction and social and governance initiatives, has accelerated ESG\u2019s growth, along with things like the ESG data and hedging products ICE offers, she added.  In equities, the S&P 500 ESG Index is up 15.4% this year, topping a 13.7% rise by the S&P 500 Index. The ESG version excludes companies with low ESG scores, as well as firms manufacturing things like tobacco and controversial weapons like land mines and chemical weapons.  Cboe launched an options contract on the S&P 500 ESG Index in September investors can use to manage sustainability risks, access long or short positions and gain broad ESG exposure.

People walk by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Global Markets headquarters building in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., September 19, 2018. REUTERS\/Michael Hirtzer  The exchange, which owns the lucrative volatility index the VIX .VIX, has taken several steps to confront manipulation claims that have helped drive the Cboe's stock down about 15 percent this year, putting it on pace for its worst year ever.  In its latest effort to police trading tied to the index, the Cboe is working with FINRA, its regulatory services provider, to develop machine learning techniques to tell whether market conditions surrounding the VIX settlement are potentially anomalous, the exchange told Reuters.  \u201cIncorporating the use of machine learning and AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a logical part of the ongoing enhancement of our overall regulatory program,\u201d Greg Hoogasian, Cboe chief regulatory officer, said in an emailed statement.  Cboe declined to elaborate on when it began using machine learning techniques to monitor VIX settlements.  Any steps, however, may take a while to change investors\u2019 minds on the stock.  \u201cAny time you see controversy over manipulating markets and it involves a company, there are people who will walk away from the stock,\u201d said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.  \u201cIt ends up tarnishing the company and subjecting them to legal risk that is very hard to quantify,\u201d he said.  Tuz said Chase Investment Counsel, which owned nearly 19,000 Cboe shares in mid-2017, began selling its stake early this year, shedding the last of it on May 21.  Cboe's stock performance this year has lagged that of other major exchange operators. Shares of Nasdaq Inc NDAQ.O are up about 17 percent, Intercontinental Exchange Inc's ICE.N is up about 10 percent and CME Group Inc CME.O shares have risen 18 percent.  Concerns the index was being manipulated surfaced last year after John Griffin and Amin Shams of the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas, Austin wrote an academic paper that noted significant spikes in trading volume in S&P 500 index options right at the time of settlement.  The paper also compared the value of the VIX at settlement with its value as calculated from S&P 500 options right after the settlement, and showed the two tend to diverge.  Instances of big deviations are taken as evidence by some that unscrupulous traders have been deliberately moving the settlement price.  A stock market fall on Feb. 5 that caused the VIX to surge the most in its 25-year history brought further scrutiny to the index, and led to dozens of lawsuits and ongoing probes into the matter by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  The regulators have yet to comment on the matter and Cboe has denied the manipulation accusations, citing liquidity problems and legitimate hedging activity as reasons for unusual moves on settlement days.  \u201cOnly a forensic analysis of those episodes can confirm or refute such a claim,\u201d said Kambiz Kazemi, partner at Canadian investment management firm La Financi\u00e8re Constance.  Meanwhile, the steps Cboe has taken to address the claims of manipulation are going in the right direction, said Kazemi.  The exchange operator recently overhauled the technology behind the auctions, improved the speed with which it sends alerts about auction imbalances, and sought to increase the number of market makers that provide buy and sell quotes for the auction.  POLICING THE FEAR GAUGE  Orderly VIX settlement auctions over the last few months have helped take some of the pressure off the Chicago-based exchange operator.  \u201cI think we all will be observing the effects of the Cboe measures in the next few months,\u201d Kazemi said.  VIX and associated products accounted for roughly a quarter of Cboe\u2019s 2017 earnings, analysts estimate, and the controversy around the product has spooked some stockholders.  While financial firms have been using artificial intelligence software for everything from compliance to stock-picking, a growing number of firms have started to use it for market oversight.  Given the huge amount of data involved in market surveillance, machine learning algorithms can be far more efficient than humans in rooting out potential market manipulation, said Richard Johnson, a market structure and technology consultant at Greenwich Associates.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a must have,\u201d he said.  FINRA, which already monitors Cboe\u2019s market on the company\u2019s behalf, confirmed it was working on machine learning to enhance surveillance of the VIX settlement auctions, but would not offer specifics.  More generally, the Wall Street watchdog is working to use artificial intelligence to catch nefarious activities more quickly, including schemes that may have previously been unknown to regulators, said Tom Gira, who oversees FINRA\u2019s market regulation department.  He said FINRA has begun using machine learning to scan for illegal activities across stock and options exchanges and is in the process of adding a feedback loop to the software that would regularly incorporate analysts\u2019 data and allow the machines to detect ever-changing manipulation patterns.","155":"Nov 2 (Reuters) - Cboe Global Markets Inc reported a 42 percent rise in quarterly profit on Friday as the exchange operator benefited from a lower tax provision and managed to rein in expenses.

Ninety-five percent of participants in a Deutsche Bank survey of investors, economists and other market participants released earlier this month said Trump, a Republican, was either \u201cextremely likely\u201d or \u201cslightly likely\u201d to win the general election.  Those results contrast with some wider recent polls cited on RealClearPolitics, which show any Democrat beating Trump in a presidential contest, although top contenders have a bigger lead. The latest Reuters\/Ipsos poll, conducted Feb. 19-25, showed Sanders with a seven percentage-point lead over Trump in a hypothetical general election matchup.  The sharp mismatch in expectations could stoke market volatility if Wall Streeters are wrong and a Democrat emerges victorious - especially if that winner is Sanders, whose promises to break up big banks, take on drug companies and essentially abolish private insurance in favor of a single government-run plan have unnerved some investors. Many on Wall Street were unprepared for Trump\u2019s win in 2016, which was followed by sharp swings in asset prices.  \u201cAs an investor, I look at this and say the market\u2019s nightmare scenario is that Bernie or Elizabeth Warren wins the election,\u201d said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, in New York. \u201cThat\u2019s not our base case ... but it\u2019s a concern,\u201d he said.  Warren\u2019s policy proposals, like Sanders\u2019, have also jangled nerves on Wall Street.  Investors will be looking ahead to next Tuesday, when 14 states will cast ballots and Sanders could build an overwhelming advantage if he captures the lion\u2019s share of the available delegates.  Those primaries come as the markets are gripped by concerns over the economic fallout from the spreading coronavirus outbreak, with the number of cases beyond China accelerating rapidly. U.S. stocks were extending the week's losses on Friday and were on track for a 7th day in the red after the S&P 500 .SPX on Thursday confirmed its fastest correction in history.  Orlando said Sanders\u2019 rise in the polls also contributed to the recent sell-off. Some investors noted that continued volatility in markets or an economic downturn could wear away at Trump\u2019s support.

REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  While the market gyrations are likely to drown out some of the potential impact from next week\u2019s voting results, some corners are already feeling the effects of Sanders\u2019 recent success.  After Sanders' commanding victory in the Nevada caucuses in February, shares of insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc UNH.N and Centene Corp CNC.N sold off on what some analysts said were concerns over the potential of a Sanders nomination.  \u201cIf Bernie runs the table and suddenly he becomes unstoppable, I think we\u2019re going to see the jitters again,\u201d said Teresa McRoberts, a portfolio manager focused on healthcare at Fred Alger Management in New York.  (Graphic: Sanders nomination odds vs health insurer shares- )  The effects on the broader market of a big Sanders win on Tuesday are less clear. Only 13% of participants in Deutsche Bank\u2019s poll believed Sanders could beat Trump in the general election, compared with 22% for former Vice President Joe Biden and 45% for former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, Texas, has kept most of his attention on the coronavirus outbreak in recent days and is not eager to make any election-related portfolio moves yet.  \u201cI think most of my clients pretty much are like me, thinking Trump is going win,\u201d he said.  Still, some investors believe the election can fuel market swings this year.  Volume on the October futures contract VXc8 for the Cboe Volatility Index .VIX hit 16,247 between Jan. 2 and Feb. 21, according to Cboe Global Markets CBOE.Z.

REUTERS\/Piroschka Van de Wouw  The EU angered market participants in March when it said that if there is a \u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit, investors in the bloc would only be able to trade shares which are listed in continental Europe as well as 14 which have a listing in Britain.  London is the centre for share trading in Europe, even for many non-UK shares, leaving EU asset managers facing a split pool of liquidity and less competitive prices.  After a spat with Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) last week partly reversed its \u201cshare trading obligation\u201d (STO) so that EU investors could still trade the 14 shares in London.  \u201cDespite this adjustment ... the STO will fragment markets and, being a supporter of open markets, I regret that result very much,\u201d ESMA Chair Steven Maijoor told a Federation of European Exchanges conference in Dublin.  The STO, however, is due to Britain deciding to leave the bloc and the risk of a no-deal Brexit, Maijoor said.  Britain has said that it will not disclose its approach to securities trading until it is clear there is no deal.  CLARITY NEEDED  Britain is due to leave the EU on Oct. 31 and with no deal in sight Maijoor sought to pile pressure on the FCA to change tack so that there would not be clashing requirements.  \u201cPractically, this may mean that clarity will only be provided a few days, or perhaps even a few hours, ahead of a no-deal situation,\u201d Maijoor said.  \u201cTo allow market participants to properly prepare for the risk of a no-deal, I sincerely hope that this timing is reconsidered, and that clarity is provided well-ahead of the October Brexit date.\u201d  Separately on Tuesday, market participants criticised what they saw as a push by the EU to build up its own capital market now that the region\u2019s largest, London, will be outside the bloc.  Bruce Savage, Deutsche Bank\u2019s head of regulatory affairs for listed derivatives, told a conference that STO was \u201cclearly being used as a tool to move liquidity from London\u201d.

The German share price index DAX graph is pictured at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, March 11, 2019. REUTERS\/Staff  The report from consultants Oxera for the Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE) wants to counter accusations from investment funds that \u201cmonopoly\u201d bourses were continually hiking fees for market data to lift profits.  Investment firms have called on the EU\u2019s markets watchdog ESMA to review market data fees charged by exchanges, saying they keep on rising despite falling costs of computing and data storage.  Oxera\u2019s report concludes that \u201ceconomic analysis suggest that the current charging structures for market data are unlikely to have detrimental effects on market outcomes for investors.\u201d  FESE said that while fees have been \u201cchallenged by some\u201d, the report showed that aggregate market data revenues have risen by only 1 percent a year, from 230 million euros ($261.2 million) in 2012 to 245 million euros in 2018.  \u201cCosts have remained stable over the last five years,\u201d said Rainer Riess, FESE director general.  Policymakers should be very mindful that any changes do not harm how prices of shares are formed, Riess added.  TRANSATLANTIC  Investment funds face scrutiny over their own fees charged customers and want to cut costs.  They have to buy data to help show regulators that they are obtaining the best share prices on behalf of investors in a region where many platforms trade the same stocks.  The Alternative Investment Management Association, Managed Funds Association, Britain\u2019s Investment Association and two German funds bodies BVI and BAI, asked ESMA in December to enforce an EU securities law that requires market data to be sold on a \u201creasonable commercial basis\u201d.  The bloc\u2019s competition officials are also facing pressure to intervene.  In the United States the Securities and Exchange Commission repealed two data price changes last May for public feeds for Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange listed securities for the first time after complaints from asset managers.  The battle across the Atlantic has led to market participants like Fidelity Investments and Citadel\u2019s securities business to back a new, low cost Members Exchange bourse to compete with NYSE.  FESE said the real issue was not prices but the \u201coften very low quality\u201d of data from off-exchange or \u201cdark\u201d trading platforms.  There has been talk for many years of a \u201cconsolidated tape\u201d or a single pipe for gathering share prices from different platforms, like in the United States.

The move followed the EU not extending stock market equivalence to Switzerland after Brussels grew frustrated with Swiss foot-dragging over the long-discussed agreement.  Bern said in response it would withdraw recognition from trading venues in the EU from July 1 to \u201cprotect the Swiss stock exchange infrastructure in the event of non-extension\u201d.  \u201cTrading venues in the EU would thus be prohibited from offering or facilitating trading in certain shares of Swiss companies from that date,\u201d the Swiss government said in a statement.  The EU refrained from extending stock market equivalence, due to expire at the end of June, because the Swiss did not endorse a partnership treaty with the EU that had been negotiated for years, a diplomat told Reuters on Friday.  Granting stock market equivalence is the EU\u2019s major leverage in trying to get the Swiss to finally sign off on an agreement governing ties, but Switzerland\u2019s foreign minister has said repeatedly that Bern will not be rushed into any deal although it remains open for talks.  Bern\u2019s request this month for \u201cclarifications\u201d on three areas - protecting wages, regulating state aid and defining the rights of EU citizens in Switzerland -- is seen in Brussels as demands to reopen the treaty text, which the EU refuses to do.  SIX, the operator of the Swiss bourse, said it welcomed the Swiss decision to activate the protective measures, as this meant EU market participants could still access the Swiss domestic market and continue to be able to trade Swiss shares directly at SIX.  Pan-European stock trading platform Aquis Exchange Plc said; \u201cIf equivalence is not extended, and if the Swiss Federal Department of Finance (FDF) rescinds recognition of EU trading venues for the trading of Swiss securities, then Aquis Exchange will take the necessary steps to comply with the directive.\u201d  It also said it will only implement the removal of Swiss securities if there is a formal notice from the Swiss FDF.  Another pan-European share trading platform, Cboe Europe, said; \u201cIn the event that Switzerland is not granted equivalence from the EU by June 30, Cboe Europe will not be permitted to admit to trading securities with a Swiss registered office and listed on a Swiss exchange with effect from the start of trading on July 1.\u201d","164":"(Repeats Friday\u2019s story with no changes to text)  * Tit-for-tat measures will block access to Swiss shares  * Brokers complain of widespread confusion from sudden ban  * Higher cost, complexity to access Swiss market  * Market participants search for workarounds  By Josephine Mason, Helen Reid and Michael Shields  LONDON\/ZURICH, June 28 (Reuters) - European stock investors and brokers are rushing to find workarounds before Swiss shares are blocked from trading on EU exchanges on Monday after a collapse in talks to resolve a dispute between Brussels and Switzerland.  In a heated row over a stalled partnership treaty, Switzerland said on Thursday that it would trigger retaliatory measures against the European Union for forbidding access to its stock markets.  That means as of Monday almost 300 shares in Swiss companies, including Nestle, Roche and Novartis, cannot be traded at EU stock exchanges which normally see around 30 percent of the volume in Zurich-listed shares.  The Swiss stock market has a market capitalisation of 1.1 trillion euros ($1.25 trillion), more than 10% of the pan European STOXX 600 index\u2019s total.  While few traders expect the ban to lead to a major market dislocation, some said it could deter them trading.  It could also get \u201ctrickier and more costly\u201d for investors who do not have direct access to the Swiss exchange, Edward Park, deputy chief investment officer at Brooks Macdonald in London, said.  Many investors and brokers were caught by surprise by the ban, saying they were unsure how trading will work.  \u201cThe only consensus at the moment is confusion,\u201d the head of electronic trading at one global brokerage said.  \u201cAll brokers are coming up with different answers depending on where they\u2019re regulated, who your client is, it\u2019s a very confusing situation,\u201d he added.  How the aftershocks of the dispute play out will be closely watched by British officials, as they try to assess how EU shares can continue to be traded in London after Brexit.  \u201cIt will be interesting to see what happens and see if all the systematic fixes work and go smoothly because that will be the case for the UK going forward,\u201d one trader said.  Some EU regulators and politicians want to end Britain\u2019s dominance of European financial markets, raising speculation that they have opted for a tough line with Switzerland in order to set a precedent.  \u201cThis is a proxy of what Brussels could inflict on London,\u201d said Stephane Barbier de la Serre, a macro strategist at Makor Capital Markets in Geneva.  RISING COSTS  The proliferation of stock trading platforms in Europe since the 2007 EU MiFID regulation created competition between exchanges, often leading to investors getting better prices.  But for Swiss stocks, the choice of venues is set to narrow.  \u201cAbout a third of the Swiss market is traded outside Switzerland; that volume moves back to Switzerland so I can still trade there ... but it\u2019s annoying as I can\u2019t use all my execution channels the way I did before,\u201d said Eric Boss, global head of trading at Allianz Global Investors.  CBOE, Aquis and London Stock Exchange\u2019s Turquoise platform, which have been handling around 25-30% of trade in Swiss stocks, have said they will cease trading these from Monday, meaning most investors will have to use Swiss exchange SIX instead.  One exchange executive said that most investors will find a way to trade, but the overall volume will likely be lower.  Most major instititutional investors already have ready access to SIX so can move their business there or else opt to do trade over-the-counter or using some investment banks\u2019 own internal trading platforms called \u201csystematic internalisers\u201d.  Both Swiss and EU officials have indicated the situation is unlikely to be permanent, but it will add an operational headache to investors already grappling with rising costs.

When activity in options resumed, the VIX surged to its highest level since December 2008. The volatility spike occurred as global stock markets were melting down on fears about the spreading coronavirus and crashing oil prices.  It followed 15-minute trading halts across U.S. exchanges, triggered by an opening 7% decline in the S&P 500 .SPX that set off circuit breakers.

REUTERS\/Jonathan Ernst  NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it will begin the first phase of a plan aimed at evaluating how stock exchange fees and incentives affect how brokers trade, even as several exchanges sue the regulator in an attempt to kill the experiment.  Exchanges will have to start collecting data on how brokers route stock orders to the exchanges starting on July 1, through Dec. 31, according to a regulatory notice released late on Tuesday.  The SEC approved its so-called Transaction Fee Pilot in December, aimed at testing how the rebate payments paid by most exchanges to brokers for stock orders that others can trade against influences brokers\u2019 behavior.  The payments added up to about $2.5 billion collectively last year and critics of the regime, which include some of the world\u2019s largest asset managers, say it may cause brokers to send customer orders to the exchanges that pay the most, even if those customer orders might get better results elsewhere.  The exchanges argue the rebates help attract liquidity, while also compensating brokers, especially market makers, for taking the risk of providing two-sided bid and ask prices for others to trade against. Without them, bid-ask spreads will widen out, making it more costly to trade, the exchanges have said.  The pilot would in some cases ban the rebates altogether for some stocks and lower exchange transaction fees.  In February, Nasdaq Inc, Cboe Global Markets and Intercontinental Exchange Inc\u2019s NYSE, which run 12 of the 13 U.S. stock exchanges currently operating, filed lawsuits against the regulator, calling the plan an exercise in government price-setting that would harm competition.  That led the SEC to temporarily stay part of the pilot program, which was recommended by a SEC-appointed committee of market experts as well as by the U.S. Treasury in a report in late 2017, until the legal challenge was heard.  But the SEC said the exchanges must still begin collecting the broker routing data needed to inform the experiment before it begins. That way if the courts find in favor of the regulator, it could start the pilot as soon as possible.","167":"LONDON (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange LSE.L said its LCH unit in Paris will provide stock trade clearing services for Cboe Europe, Europe's largest pan-European share trading platform.  \u201cThis is the latest milestone in our strategy to expand the number of equities trading venues available to our clearing members,\u201d said Christophe Hemon, CEO of LCH in Paris.","168":"* ESMA says ticker tape would take five years to build  * Tape would limit market power of trading platforms  * Tape worth having despite UK leaving EU, ESMA says (Adds graphic, banking reaction)  LONDON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The European Union\u2019s securities watchdog said on Thursday that stock exchanges should be forced to contribute prices to a pan-European feed for trades to make it easier for investors to compare prices on different platforms.  Market users like asset managers and banks should also be forced to contribute to funding costs for the feed, or ticker tape, the European Securities and Markets Authority said.  The EU has long sought to copy the United States and have a \u201cconsolidated tape\u201d (CT) that lists in real time stock prices traded on upwards of 20 platforms and exchanges across the bloc, making it easier for investors to spot the best prices.  Previous efforts to create a tape foundered after disagreements on how much exchanges could charge for data, making a tape commercially unviable.  ESMA, which has powers to appoint a tape supplier, said EU securities rules known as MiFID II had failed to cut the cost of stock market data for users like banks and asset managers.  \u201cMoreover, as no consolidated tape has materialised, ESMA recommends the establishment of a European Union wide real-time consolidated tape for equity instruments,\u201d ESMA said in a statement.  Banking trade body AFME said it welcomed ESMA\u2019s recognition that the overall price of market data had risen and that pricing was not typically based upon the costs of producing and disseminating the data.  ESMA said the tape should be based on mandatory contribution of price data from trading platforms, with revenues shared among contributors.  The \u201clong and complex process\u201d for creating a tape would require legal changes and take five years to \u201cgo live\u201d, it said.  London is the EU\u2019s biggest share trading centre but Britain is due to leave the bloc in January.  \u201cESMA is of the view that an EU27 consolidated tape would provide added value after Brexit, even though the value of a CT would be higher if it included UK data,\u201d the watchdog said.  DATA BATTLE  Asset managers want cheaper stock market data to help them meet requirements under MiFID II to show investors they are getting the best deals.  Exchanges have hit back, saying they are not gouging users with high data fees, but ESMA signalled it would look further into the issue given that MiFID II requires market data to be made available on a \u201creasonable\u201d commercial basis.  ESMA said a consolidated tape would \u201climit to some extent\u201d the market power of trading platforms when selling real-time data on executed trades.  \u201cAccess to market data is becoming increasingly important for securities markets and it is important that data users know what they are paying for,\u201d ESMA Chair Steven Maijoor said.  \u201cESMA will therefore provide further guidance on the cost of market data.\u201d","169":"LONDON (Reuters) - Euro-denominated government bond, repurchase agreement and foreign exchange trading at CME Group has moved from London to Amsterdam to avoid disruption from Brexit, the exchange said on Monday.

Britain\u2019s government is scrambling to get support in parliament for a Brexit deal ahead of an EU summit on Thursday.  Separately on Monday, EuroCCP, a clearing house for stock trades, said it had obtained regulatory approval to clear trades for the new EU entities of Cboe Europe, Aquis Exchange, and London Stock Exchange\u2019s Turquoise from April 1.  EuroCCP said it had also \u201con-boarded\u201d six new EU-based entities acting as clearing members, and more than 10 new EU-based trading members.  EuroCCP, which clears over 30 percent of European share trades, is incorporated in the Netherlands and owned by Dutch Bank ABN Amro, Cboe Europe, Euronext, Nasdaq, and the U.S. Depository Trust & Clearing Corp (DTCC).  The announcement means that a large chunk of clearing in euro-denominated share trades, currently handled by EuroCCP and rivals like LCH in London, is also set to move to Amsterdam.  Clearing refers to a third party that ensures completion of a trade even if one side goes bust.  EuroCCP said it would activate the new clearing arrangements in EU-listed securities as soon as the new EU-based venues are ready  \u201cWhile the uncertainty continues and despite the increasing likelihood that there may be a delay to Brexit, we are still focused on our preparations in case the UK leaves the EU on 29 March,\u201d said EuroCCP Chief Executive C\u00e9cile Nagel.  Aquis is opening a new hub in Paris for trading euro-denominated shares, while the Turquoise unit is in Amsterdam.","170":"LONDON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Pan-European stock exchange Euronext said on Wednesday it would launch a public consultation next month on whether to shorten the trading day.  \u201cIn each of our six markets, we will not only consult our direct members, but also upstream buy side and retail associations and the operators of post trade processes, clearing and settlement,\u201d Euronext said in an emailed statement.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar  NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Members Exchange (MEMX), a new U.S. stock exchange backed by some of the biggest customers of the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Inc, launched on Monday with pricing aimed at taking market share from the incumbents.  \u201cOut of the gate, we\u2019re looking to be aggressive in order to attract order flow so that people can experience our exchange,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Kellner said in a recent interview.  The new bourse went live trading seven symbols, including Alphabet Inc, BlackBerry Ltd, and Exxon Mobil Corp <XOM.N), and plans to begin trading all U.S. stocks on Sept. 29.  The exchange\u2019s mission is to improve the market through technological innovation, reduced complexity, and lower fees, while being a voice for its members on market issues, Kellner said.  MEMX was founded in January 2019 by nine financial institutions, including Bank of America, Charles Schwab Corp, Virtu Financial, Morgan Stanley, Fidelity and Citadel Securities.  Since then, MEMX has raised more than $135 million and brought on more than 40 members, including BlackRock Inc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase and Co and Jane Street Capital.  The Jersey City, New Jersey-based exchange was founded after years of complaints by brokers and other market participants over what they saw as unjustifiably high fees charged by most exchanges for things like market data and exchange connectivity.  Initially, MEMX will give away its market data and will pay more in rebates to brokers that add liquidity to its exchange than it charges in trading fees, meaning it will lose money as it tries to take share from Intercontinental Exchange Inc\u2019s NYSE, Nasdaq, and Cboe Global Markets.  The exchange will \u201cnormalize\u201d its fees once it attracts meaningful volume, but those fees will be very competitive and MEMX will be transparent in how it sets them, Kellner said.","172":"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday dismissed an antitrust lawsuit by investors who accused the parent of the Chicago Board Options Exchange of letting anonymous traders rig the \u201cfear gauge,\u201d Wall Street\u2019s main gauge of future stock market volatility, at their expense.

A trading obligation from the FCA would mean that liquidity in many shares would be split if there is a no-deal Brexit, he said. The FCA had no immediate comment.  \u201cI believe there is a turf war going on, which is politically motivated,\u201d Haynes said.  London is the biggest share trading centre for many European shares and the bloc is seeking to build up its own capital market now that Britain is leaving the bloc.  A tit-for-tat move by the FCA would mean that market participants authorised in Britain would have to trade thousands of shares from across Europe in London, and not on platforms based in the bloc.  Three leading pan-European share trading platforms based in London, Cboe Europe, London Stock Exchange\u2019s Turquoise, and Aquis have all opened new platforms in the EU for clients to avoid disruption from Brexit.  Trading in euro-denominated shares is expected to move from London to the new hubs to keep liquidity intact, which would mean a loss of business for Britain.  Turquoise and Cboe said last week that share trading at new Amsterdam hubs had not started because Britain did not leave the EU on March 29 as originally planned.","184":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Trading in stocks and derivatives was frozen for three hours in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris on Monday due to a technical glitch at exchange operator Euronext.  Exchange outages, caused by software and hardware glitches, cyberattacks, and even hungry squirrels, have roiled markets and shaken investor confidence for decades, as trading has moved from the floors and pits of bourses to electronic systems that match trades at nearly the speed of light.

Aug. 28: New Zealand\u2019s stock exchange resumed trading after four consecutive days of disruptions in the wake of cyberattacks.  July 1: A software glitch temporarily shut down trading on Germany\u2019s electronic trading platform Xetra, managed by Deutsche Boerse. It was the second time the system had gone down since April.  May 8: The Moscow Exchange suspended stock trading for 42 minutes because of a software error.  Feb. 27: TMX Group Ltd, Canada\u2019s biggest stock exchange operator, had its second outage in less than two years, when a hardware failure caused problems with order entries, resulting in the shutdown of trading across three local bourses for nearly two hours.  November 1, 2019: Nasdaq Inc\u2019s Nordic and Baltic stock markets were halted by technical problems twice in one day due to exchange connectivity problems.  September 5, 2019: Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing suspended derivatives trading for the afternoon due to a software bug that led to connectivity issues on the Hong Kong Futures Automatic Trading System.  August 16, 2019: A software issue delayed the start of trading on the UK blue chip FTSE 100 and midcap stock indexes for almost two hours in what was the longest outage at the London Stock Exchange in eight years.  April 25, 2018: Intercontinental Exchange Inc\u2019s New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) suspended trading in five stocks, including Amazon and Alphabet, for part of the day due to a technical glitch involving trade reporting.  July 14, 2016: The Singapore Exchange Ltd suspended securities trading for the last half of the day due to duplicate trade confirmation messages being generated.  July 8, 2015: The NYSE was forced to suspend trading for several hours due to an internal technical issue.  March 31, 2015: ICE\u2019s NYSE Arca had a technical glitch that resulted in some of the most popular exchange-traded funds being temporarily unavailable for trading and some investors paying more for stocks than they otherwise may have.  Aug. 22, 2013: Trading in all Nasdaq-listed stocks was halted for several hours after a software glitch caused connectivity issues to an industry data feed. The shutdown prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to summon Wall Street leaders to hash out a plan to improve market stability. In November 2014, the SEC passed a new rule that said exchanges must establish and enforce policies to ensure their systems are resilient and secure.

Robert Ophele, chairman of France\u2019s AMF markets watchdog, said Brexit will force the EU to undertake a complete review of the so-called MiFID II rules.  \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a need for a major overhaul of MiFID, but clearly there are some quick fixes, some elements that should be adapted,\u201d Ophele told a conference held by AFME, a banking industry body.  The MiFID rules, which run to hundreds of pages, were only introduced in January, a year late, because of the complexity and the cost for trading firms, banks and even regulators to implement them.  France is actively courting banks based in Britain that are opening EU hubs to avoid Brexit disruption, hoping they will base their trading operations in Paris.  Ophele said legislative fixes were needed to stop market participants circumventing the rules and to improve the quality of transaction data.  \u201cMiFID II may be a complex piece of law, but that does not mean we should shy away from re-opening it and fixing deficiencies where evidence may show that we have gone too far or have generated unintended consequences,\u201d Ophele told an industry event in London.  MiFID II has introduced caps on trading shares in the \u201cdark\u201d or away from transparent platforms like stock exchanges, but Brexit will mean that much of that trading will no longer be in the bloc.  \u201cIn the light of this, it makes sense to question whether MiFID II\u2019s quantitative calibrations will be relevant tomorrow when the UK is no longer in the EU,\u201d Ophele said.  TOUGHER EQUIVALENCE  Waivers from MiFID rules affecting commodities trading will also need to be revisited given that nearly all metals, oil and coal derivatives are traded in London, Ophele said.  MiFID allows trading firms based outside the EU to serve customers in the bloc if their home rules are aligned or \u201cequivalent\u201d to the bloc\u2019s own regulation.  Ophele said that foreign firms should be made to comply with more of MiFID\u2019s reporting and trading obligations for derivatives and shares in order to qualify, dashing UK hopes of an easing of the equivalence regime.  Separately on Monday, the EU\u2019s securities watchdog ESMA published a letter dated Sept. 26 to the European Commission that also called for tougher application of MiFID to non-EU firms that serve investors in the bloc.  So-called reverse solicitation, or where a non-EU firm is allowed to serve an EU customer that had initiated the initial contact, should also be reviewed, ESMA said.  MiFID \u201cdoes not ensure a consistent and convergent level of protection to investors interacting with third country firms\u201d, ESMA added.  Brussels will only decide if a foreign firm is equivalent if it has cooperation agreements with its regulator. Ophele said firms should assume there will be such an agreement between supervisors in the EU and Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority.","191":"FILE PHOTO: Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Global Markets sign hangs at its headquarters building in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., September 19, 2018. REUTERS\/Michael Hirtzer  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exchange operator Cboe Global Markets reported higher second-quarter earnings on Friday, driven by a surge in retail investor participation in the markets that boosted stock and options trading volumes, offsetting lower institutional demand.  The Chicago-based company hit record trading volumes in U.S. cash equities and multi-listed options during the quarter ended June 30, fueled by the spike in Main Street trading activity, Cboe Chief Executive Officer Ed Tilly said on a call with analysts.  That helped lift Cboe\u2019s net income to $113.3 million, or $1.03 cents per share, from $87.6 million, or 78 cents per share, in the year-earlier quarter.  But demand for Cboe\u2019s proprietary products, such as the VIX volatility index, also known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, was muted, as concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic drove many large investors onto the sidelines.  \u201cYou need to see the end of the event that\u2019s causing the uncertainty, and there\u2019s no end in sight, quite honestly. We don\u2019t know how this pandemic ends,\u201d Tilly said.  The failure to contain the coronavirus in the United States, recent increases in unemployment and historic declines in gross domestic product, among other key events, are driving the elevated levels of market uncertainty, he said.  Cboe\u2019s options trading revenues rose 7% in the quarter versus a year earlier, while U.S. stock trading revenues were up 22%.

A reform of MiFID II, the EU\u2019s rules on trading stocks, bonds and other securities, has become more pressing after Britain\u2019s departure saw 6 billion euros a day of euro share trading shift overnight from London to the bloc last week.  But the plans have sparked a tussle between exchanges and the banks and asset managers, who are both their main customers and their competitors in some cases.  Exchanges argue that too much trading, about half the total according to some official estimates, takes place on \u201cdark\u201d venues or inside investment banks like Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, and want limits set.  \u201cWe need to fight for more transparency,\u201d said Rainer Riess, director general of the Federation of European Securities Exchanges, which represents bourses like Euronext and Deutsche Boerse.  But Tilman Lueder, head of securities markets at the European Commission, the 27-country EU\u2019s executive, said a closer look is needed before deciding on any curbs.  \u201cWe should drill a bit deeper into some of the data sets,\u201d Lueder told the FESE webinar. \u201cWe should look at what is the relevant market and maybe not take a decision on a dog\u2019s dinner of all kinds of trades.\u201d  When \u201ctechnical trades\u201d were filtered out, there is an encouraging increase in trades on exchanges, he said.  A new data analysis will be launched in the first half of this year with any proposals for changing the rules presented in the autumn, Lueder added.  Paul Hilgers, managing director at Deutsche Boerse Group, said that with 600 trading platforms in the EU, there is a need to simplify infrastructure to stop \u201cfree riders\u201d that use exchanges for prices.  But Urban Funered, chief executive of the Swedish Securities Markets Association, said there was a need to avoid returning to the \u201cgood old days\u201d of stock exchanges with national monopolies.

FILE PHOTO: People walk by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Global Markets headquarters building in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., September 19, 2018. REUTERS\/Michael Hirtzer  It is the latest deal in a rapidly consolidating market where the Swiss Exchange has bid for its Madrid counterpart and the London Stock Exchange LSE.L is buying financial market data company Refinitiv.  Cboe, the biggest pan-European share trading platform, already owns 20% of EuroCCP.  It is buying out the four 20% stakes held by exchanges Euronext ENX.PA and Nasdaq NDAQ.O, Dutch bank ABN Amro ABNd.AS and The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC).  Chicago-headquartered Cboe said it was paying cash but declined to say how much.  Euronext said it would receive net proceeds of 9 million euros, indicating Cboe paid roughly 36 million in total.  The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2020 after regulatory approvals have been received.  The combination of Europe\u2019s biggest share trading platform and equities clearing house could raise concerns among users that a \u201cvertical silo\u201d is being built to squeeze higher fees out of them.  \u201cOur plan is not to recreate the vertical silo and pull up the drawbridge and issue price rises once a year without speaking to customers,\u201d said David Howson, chief operating officer of Cboe Europe.  It would be up to Cboe customers where they want to clear trades, he added.  Cboe wants to ramp up trading and clearing in equity futures and options by investing an undisclosed sum that will dilute earnings for the next three to four years, Howson said.  Euronext also wants to expand equity derivatives trading. It said on Tuesday it would look to do this through its 11.1% stake in LCH SA, the Paris unit of LCH, the world\u2019s biggest derivatives clearing house, which is owned by the London Stock Exchange.  EuroCCP CEO Cecile Nagel said the company was making money but looking for a \u201cstep change\u201d in strategy, which was difficult with five shareholders.  Cboe, which runs a pan-European share trading platform in London, has opened a subsidiary in Amsterdam ahead of Britain\u2019s planned exit from the European Union next month.  \u201cIf we leave on January 31, beyond that we will be looking to see how we encourage further trading through the venue,\u201d Howson said.  EuroCCP\u2019s base in Amsterdam was a consideration in the acquisition due to Brexit, he said.  Being based inside the EU puts the Cboe-EuroCCP combination in a \u201cvery good place\u201d if the bloc sought to limit trading of euro denominated shares in London, or made it harder for non-EU clearing houses to serve EU customers, Howson said.  The EU is likely to welcome consolidation that helps make its capital market more efficient and reduce reliance on London, even if it is being driven by a U.S. exchange.","199":"LONDON (Reuters) - Banks are dusting off their no-deal Brexit plans as concerns deepen that Britain and the European Union won\u2019t agree a trade deal by December as the COVID-19 pandemic compounds fundamental disagreements over future relations.  FILE PHOTO: People look out onto the Canary Wharf district as they walk through Greenwich Park in London, Britain, March 22, 2020. REUTERS\/Simon Dawson  Financial services exports to the EU are worth about 26 billion pounds ($32.51 billion) a year, and although Britain left the bloc in January it still has unfettered access until the end of December under a transition agreement, allowing banks, asset managers and insurers to continue serving their biggest export market.  But that leaves the UK with just a few months to negotiate a trade deal with the EU that would come into effect in January to avoid a \u201ccliff-edge\u201d in business activity. If it wants an extension to the transition period, it must ask Brussels by the end of June.  \u201cBrexit is firmly back up the agenda, people are talking about it and are very conscious of the very short time to get any deal agreed,\u201d said Catherine McGuinness, political leader of the City of London financial district, adding that financial industry groups met in recent days to discuss preparations.  \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody is expecting a transition extension at the moment, but the timetable is very tight. We are dusting down our papers on the various solutions to the cliff-edge problems.\u201d  Despite fundamental disagreements in the talks and political focus shifting to the pandemic, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has insisted he won\u2019t request an extension.  \u201cBrexit has not gone away. It\u2019s full steam ahead. The trade negotiations are not going smoothly and we have to assume some chance of an exit without a deal,\u201d a source at a major global bank said.  The government\u2019s firm no-extension stance has killed off lobbying efforts by the financial industry, the source added.  Miles Celic, chief executive of TheCityUK, which promotes Britain as a financial centre, said the government had to be taken at \u201cface value\u201d, and bankers said the sector would not ask for an extension.  \u201cPeople are looking at no deal preparedness again,\u201d said Rachel Kent, a financial services partner at Hogan Lovells law firm who was present at the industry talks on Brexit.  Banks are largely reviving plans they had when a no-deal Brexit loomed several times in 2019 before Britain and the EU signed off on a divorce settlement and transition period.  Under the plans banks would move more staff and activities to their new EU hubs to serve customers inside the bloc rather than from Britain.  A source at a second major global bank said that although the coronavirus pandemic had eclipsed Brexit for now, its no-deal plans were still at hand.  \u201cAll the plans are there, it\u2019s not like they didn\u2019t exist,\u201d the source said.  JUNE MILESTONE  The source at the first major global bank said everybody was aware that financial market access under the EU\u2019s patchy \u201cequivalence\u201d system was the best the sector could expect.  Brussels grants direct financial market access if it deems a foreign country\u2019s regulations are in line with its own. The EU has said it would look to complete its assessment of UK equivalence also by the end of June.  \u201cJune is a key time politically and the key priority is those equivalence assessments being in place sufficiently in advance of the end of the transition period,\u201d a European banking industry official said.  Obtaining equivalence is critical for clearing houses in London to avoid them having to tell EU clients in September to move positions worth billions of euros out of Britain by the end of the year.  \u201cAlthough we would love to see progress by June, I am not holding my breath because, let\u2019s deal with COVID first,\u201d the City of London\u2019s McGuinness said.  There is already talk that Britain may prefer not to have a trade deal to avoid having its hands tied while supporting an economy thrown into deep recession by the pandemic, Hogan Lovells\u2019 Kent said.  \u201cThere is a feeling that can best be done without the constraint of being in the EU with issues like state aid and the need to have consent before supportive measures can be taken.\u201d  Britain also has to decide whether to grant equivalence type access to EU financial firms that want to serve UK customers.  Bankers and McGuinness said Britain should go ahead and grant such access regardless of what the bloc decides on financial market access for Britain in coming months.  \u201cWe should be an open trading nation, we always have been and ought to remain so. It would be cutting our own nose to spite our faces if we keep people out,\u201d McGuinness said.","200":"May 14 (Reuters) - Cboe Global Markets Inc:  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS PLANS LISTING OF OPTIONS ON UBER TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

FILE PHOTO: Skyscrapers in The City of London financial district are seen in London, Britain, September 14, 2020. REUTERS\/Hannah McKay  While a Brexit trade deal agreed last month set rules for industries such as fishing and agriculture, it did not cover Britain\u2019s much larger finance sector, meaning London\u2019s automatic access to EU financial markets came to an end on Dec. 31.  That has meant the bulk of trading in euro-denominated shares has had to switch from London to the EU, as the bloc seeks to reduce its reliance on a finance centre outside its borders.  Many London-based businesses had prepared for the new conditions by setting up units in the EU, and Monday put those new arrangements to the test.  Trading on Cboe Europe and London Stock Exchange\u2019s Turquoise units in Amsterdam, and on Aquis Exchange\u2019s new Paris platform, grew steadily with no glitches reported.  Data from Cboe, Europe\u2019s biggest cross-border share trading platform, showed that two hours after the open, 60% of all of its activity was at its Amsterdam unit.  \u201cAll our systems are operating normally, and as expected the majority of activity in EEA-symbols (mainly EU listed shares) is now taking place on our Dutch venue, with activity across all our market segments,\u201d Cboe Europe president David Howson said.

Aquis reported a \u201cclean shift\u201d in euro share trading from its London base to its new Paris unit, with the French capital now the location for most of the group\u2019s business.  Aquis traded 1.9 billion euros of shares on Monday, mostly in Paris.  Trading on Turquoise was more evenly split, with 525 million euros in Amsterdam and 361 million euros in London.  No European trading of note had taken place on the three EU hubs until Monday.  Trading in non-EU listed shares remains in London.  \u201cI don\u2019t think there has been any impact from this switch,\u201d said Keith Temperton, equity sales trader at Forte Securities. \u201cIt has been planned for years.\u201d  Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the EU\u2019s European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) had no comment.  FRANKFURT CALLING  Banks and other financial market participants in the EU are also required to trade swaps, a type of derivatives contract, on platforms inside the bloc and stop using venues in London, the world\u2019s biggest centre for trading swaps.  In a last minute intervention on Dec. 24 before markets shut until Monday, the FCA said it would allow UK market participants to trade swaps on EU venues until the end of March to avoid disruption in markets.  Traders said that on Dec. 24 the spread between the 10-year interest rate swap on Deutsche Boerse\u2019s Eurex in Frankfurt and LSE\u2019s LCH swaps clearing unit in London widened.  This signified that it was more expensive to use Eurex Clearing than LCH. A trader said that normally there is little or no spread between the two clearing houses.  Eurex, which is offering customers incentives to attract euro clearing from London, said the spread had widened to 0.4 basis points on Dec. 24, but has since eased to 0.3 basis points.  Christoph Rieger, head of rates and credit research at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said there was no big disruption in initial trading on Monday.  ESMA on Monday cancelled its authorisation for four trade repositories in London used for reporting derivatives trades, in a further sign of the British capital being locked out of EU markets.","203":"(Corrects town to Trumbull, Connecticut, in last item)  NEW YORK, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Trading in stocks and derivatives was frozen for three hours in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris on Monday due to a technical glitch at exchange operator Euronext.  Exchange outages, caused by software and hardware glitches, cyberattacks, and even hungry squirrels, have roiled markets and shaken investor confidence for decades, as trading has moved from the floors and pits of bourses to electronic systems that match trades at nearly the speed of light.  Here are some of the major outages:  Oct. 1: Trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was brought to a standstill by a hardware failure, in the worst-ever outage for the world\u2019s third-largest equity market.  Aug. 28: New Zealand\u2019s stock exchange resumed trading after four consecutive days of disruptions in the wake of cyberattacks.  July 1: A software glitch temporarily shut down trading on Germany\u2019s electronic trading platform Xetra, managed by Deutsche Boerse. It was the second time the system had gone down since April.  May 8: The Moscow Exchange suspended stock trading for 42 minutes because of a software error.  Feb. 27: TMX Group Ltd, Canada\u2019s biggest stock exchange operator, had its second outage in less than two years, when a hardware failure caused problems with order entries, resulting in the shutdown of trading across three local bourses for nearly two hours.  November 1, 2019: Nasdaq Inc\u2019s Nordic and Baltic stock markets were halted by technical problems twice in one day due to exchange connectivity problems.  September 5, 2019: Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing suspended derivatives trading for the afternoon due to a software bug that led to connectivity issues on the Hong Kong Futures Automatic Trading System.  August 16, 2019: A software issue delayed the start of trading on the UK blue chip FTSE 100 and midcap stock indexes for almost two hours in what was the longest outage at the London Stock Exchange in eight years.  April 25, 2018: Intercontinental Exchange Inc\u2019s New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) suspended trading in five stocks, including Amazon and Alphabet, for part of the day due to a technical glitch involving trade reporting.  July 14, 2016: The Singapore Exchange Ltd suspended securities trading for the last half of the day due to duplicate trade confirmation messages being generated.  July 8, 2015: The NYSE was forced to suspend trading for several hours due to an internal technical issue.  March 31, 2015: ICE\u2019s NYSE Arca had a technical glitch that resulted in some of the most popular exchange-traded funds being temporarily unavailable for trading and some investors paying more for stocks than they otherwise may have.  Aug. 22, 2013: Trading in all Nasdaq-listed stocks was halted for several hours after a software glitch caused connectivity issues to an industry data feed. The shutdown prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to summon Wall Street leaders to hash out a plan to improve market stability. In November 2014, the SEC passed a new rule that said exchanges must establish and enforce policies to ensure their systems are resilient and secure.  May 18, 2012: Facebook Inc\u2019s $16 billion initial public offering on the Nasdaq was marred by technical glitches that resulted in a delayed opening and many traders being left in the dark for hours as to which trades had gone through, leading to substantial losses at several firms.  March 23, 2012: Bats Global Markets, which was later bought by Cboe Global Markets, was forced to cancel its IPO on its own exchange after a series of glitches caused by a software bug.  May 6, 2010: Unsettled market conditions combined with a massive, aggressive sell order for a popular futures security triggered a \u201cflash crash\u201d that sent the Dow Jones industrial average plunging over 1,000 points, temporarily wiping out nearly $1 trillion in market value.  August 2, 1994: A squirrel chewed through a power line in Trumbull, Connecticut, where the Nasdaq used to keep its servers, and the exchange\u2019s backup power system failed to kick in, leading to a more than half an hour outage.

Despite the move to all-electronic trading, none of the exchange operators experienced any major technical glitches amid record volumes, and all of them reported first-quarter profits that beat analysts\u2019 expectations.  Cboe aims to reopen its options trading floor on June 1 after acknowledging that some customers were frustrated by the exchange\u2019s electronic trading tools and were unable to get the most risky and complex types of orders completed, it said on Friday.  At the same time, Chief Executive Ed Tilly said Cboe will soon roll out new electronic solutions that will replicate benefits of the floor for those more complex orders, prompting analysts to question the need to reopen the spaces at all.  \u201cOur position has always been that when our customers tell us that there\u2019s no utility in the trading crowd, when brokers provide no service to their customers, the electronic solution will close the trading floor, not Cboe and not its management team,\u201d Tilly said.  The NYSE is the only U.S. exchange that still operates stock trading floors alongside electronic trading. It released a study on Thursday showing that floor traders dampen volatility by providing tighter bid-offer spreads, especially at the market close, saving investors millions of dollars a day.  While the floor distinguishes NYSE from its competitors, the closure has not led to a significant drop in market share, according to an analysis released Friday by industry trade group, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.  \u201cOnly time will tell if investors feel the difference in execution of their trades with or without the human interaction on the floor,\u201d the study said.

The London Stock Exchange has already held a public consultation on shortening the trading day, but has said that backing from major bourses across Europe would be needed to cut hours.  Euronext, which operates markets in France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Portugal, is due to open its own public consultation on trading hours next month before reaching a conclusion.  \u201cWe will come with an opinion to comment on whether the proposal that has been put forward mainly out of London is relevant for continental Europe and Irish markets, or is more of a local idea,\u201d Boujnah told reporters.  \u201cFrankly at this moment, I don\u2019t know.\u201d  Analysis was needed on the short and long term impact of such a change, in particular on retail investors, Boujnah said.  \u201cIs there a next step following that one?

The move puts NYSE Chicago\u2019s pricing structure more in line with that of a contentious plan by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission called the transaction fee pilot. The NYSE is suing the regulator to prevent that from taking place.  NYSE Chicago, one of five NYSE-branded stock exchanges owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc ICE.N, said in a Nov. 12 regulatory filing it would begin charging 10 cents per 100 shares for transactions on the exchange.  That is down from 30 cents per 100 shares for orders that are immediately executed, and it eliminates a rebate payment from the exchange of 20 cents per 100 shares for orders that rest on the exchange for others to trade against.  The SEC\u2019s transaction fee pilot, recommended by an SEC-appointed committee of market experts and also by the U.S. Treasury in a 2017 report, would test lowering transaction fees to 10 cents per 100 shares. It would also ban rebates for some stocks to help the SEC better understand how the incentives affect brokers\u2019 behavior.  In February, NYSE, Nasdaq Inc NDAQ.O, and Cboe Global Markets CBOE.Z, which run 12 of the 13 U.S. stock exchanges currently operating, filed lawsuits against the SEC over the plan, calling it an exercise in government price-setting that would harm competition.  Rebates help attract liquidity, while also compensating market makers for taking the risk of providing two-sided bid and ask prices for others to trade against, the exchanges said.  Without the incentives, which collectively added up to around $2.5 billion last year, bid-ask spreads will widen out, making it more costly to trade, they added.  Trade groups representing institutional investors managing tens of trillions of dollars worth of assets have supported the SEC plan, saying rebates can give brokers an incentive to send customer orders to the exchanges that pay the most, even if those customer orders might get better results elsewhere.  The exchanges are now required to collect data on how brokers route orders to them, but the pilot program is otherwise on hold until the lawsuits have been resolved.","215":"(Reuters) - Exchange operator Cboe Global Markets CBOE.Z said on Tuesday it plans to reopen its options trading floor in Chicago on June 8, more than two months after the coronavirus outbreak forced it to move to all-electronic trading.

FILE PHOTO: An EU flag flies beside Switzerland's national flag near the German-Swiss border in Rheinfelden, Germany, March 11, 2019. REUTERS\/Arnd WIegmann\/File Photo  In a heated row over a stalled partnership treaty, Switzerland said on Thursday that it would trigger retaliatory measures against the European Union for forbidding access to its stock markets.  That means as of Monday almost 300 shares in Swiss companies, including Nestle, Roche and Novartis, cannot be traded at EU stock exchanges which normally see around 30 percent of the volume in Zurich-listed shares.  The Swiss stock market has a market capitalization of 1.1 trillion euros ($1.25 trillion), more than 10% of the pan European STOXX 600 .STOXX index's total.  While few traders expect the ban to lead to a major market dislocation, some said it could deter them trading.  It could also get \u201ctrickier and more costly\u201d for investors who do not have direct access to the Swiss exchange, Edward Park, deputy chief investment officer at Brooks Macdonald in London, said.  Many investors and brokers were caught by surprise by the ban, saying they were unsure how trading will work.  \u201cThe only consensus at the moment is confusion,\u201d the head of electronic trading at one global brokerage said.  \u201cAll brokers are coming up with different answers depending on where they\u2019re regulated, who your client is, it\u2019s a very confusing situation,\u201d he added.  How the aftershocks of the dispute play out will be closely watched by British officials, as they try to assess how EU shares can continue to be traded in London after Brexit.  \u201cIt will be interesting to see what happens and see if all the systematic fixes work and go smoothly because that will be the case for the UK going forward,\u201d one trader said.  Some EU regulators and politicians want to end Britain\u2019s dominance of European financial markets, raising speculation that they have opted for a tough line with Switzerland in order to set a precedent.  \u201cThis is a proxy of what Brussels could inflict on London,\u201d said Stephane Barbier de la Serre, a macro strategist at Makor Capital Markets in Geneva.  RISING COSTS  The proliferation of stock trading platforms in Europe since the 2007 EU MiFID regulation created competition between exchanges, often leading to investors getting better prices.  But for Swiss stocks, the choice of venues is set to narrow.  \u201cAbout a third of the Swiss market is traded outside Switzerland; that volume moves back to Switzerland so I can still trade there ... but it\u2019s annoying as I can\u2019t use all my execution channels the way I did before,\u201d said Eric Boss, global head of trading at Allianz Global Investors.  CBOE, Aquis and London Stock Exchange\u2019s Turquoise platform, which have been handling around 25-30% of trade in Swiss stocks, have said they will cease trading these from Monday, meaning most investors will have to use Swiss exchange SIX instead.  One exchange executive said that most investors will find a way to trade, but the overall volume will likely be lower.  Most major institutional investors already have ready access to SIX so can move their business there or else opt to do trade over-the-counter or using some investment banks\u2019 own internal trading platforms called \u201csystematic internalizers\u201d.

REUTERS\/Jonathan Ernst  The exchanges must \u201cfully and fairly describe\u201d their proposed fees and show that they are reasonable, equitably allocated, not unfairly discriminatory, or an undue burden competition, as required by the Exchange Act, SEC staff said in guidance released late on Tuesday.  The move was prompted by a years-long dispute over what many brokers and investors see as sky-rocketing costs for things like market data and connectivity to the exchanges, both of which are essential for trading, but are also major revenue drivers for most exchanges.  Collectively, exchange operators including New York Stock Exchange-owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc, Nasdaq Inc and Cboe Global Markets, file hundreds of new fees or rebates, or changes to existing ones, with the SEC per year. Because the exchanges are considered self-regulatory organizations, the rule filings become immediately effective.  But last year the SEC increased its scrutiny of fee filings, putting a wide swath of them under review as part of a broader effort by the regulator under Chairman Jay Clayton to improve transparency around exchange pricing.  The exchanges have appealed the decision and the fees are still in place, but the SEC guidance released Tuesday indicated the exchanges must do a better job justifying their fees or continue to have them temporarily suspended and put under review.  \u201cCompetition remains robust in the exchange industry and we will continue to work closely with our clients and the SEC to ensure transparency and fairness,\u201d Nasdaq spokesman Allan Schoenberg said in a statement.

The regulator delayed its start date in March after the three largest exchange operators sued to kill the pilot.  The exchanges say rebates help attract liquidity, while also compensating brokers, especially market makers, for taking the risk of providing two-sided bid and ask prices for others to trade against. Without them, bid-ask spreads will widen out, making it more costly to trade, the exchanges have argued.  The system has many critics.  \u201cThe transaction fee pilot is a constructive and long overdue first step toward fixing an outdated and byzantine pricing model that is badly in need of reform,\u201d the Investment Company Institute (ICI) and the Council of Institutional Investors (CII) said in a joint amicus brief in support of the SEC. \u201cIt should be allowed to proceed.\u201d  The trade groups, which represent institutional investors managing tens of trillions of dollars worth of assets, said the pricing system gives brokers an incentive to send customer orders to the exchanges that pay the most, even if those customer orders might get better results elsewhere.  Collectively, Nasdaq Inc, Cboe Global Markets and New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc, paid out about $2.5 billion last year in rebates, which can be key drivers in attracting market share.  ICI and CII also said the system increases market complexity by fueling the proliferation of trading venues that offer various pricing models catering to high-speed traders, which make up half the trading volume in the market, looking to harvest rebates.  NYSE operates five stock exchanges, Cboe four, and Nasdaq three. The need to connect to all of these exchanges raises costs for investors, the trade groups said.  The pilot, which was recommended by an SEC-appointed committee of market experts as well as the U.S. Treasury in a report in late 2017, would in some cases ban the rebates altogether for some stocks and lower exchange transaction fees.","220":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exchange operator IEX Group on Tuesday said it plans to introduce a new way to place stock orders that will reduce the chance of trading when the price is likely to move away, leveling the playing field between fast and slow traders.  IEX has asked regulators to approve an order type called Discretionary Limit, that uses machine learning to predict when a stock price is about to change - something only the fastest traders can react to - and then updates the prices of resting orders on the exchange so they are not hit during those times.  The New York-based exchange said its machine learning-based \"crumbling quote indicator\" is on for 0.02% of the trading day, but during that time 24% of all displayed trading happens, indicating that sophisticated traders are taking advantage of tiny windows of time when prices are changing. (link.medium.com\/30b6IADFu2)  IEX was thrust into the spotlight in 2014 when it was featured in Michael Lewis\u2019s book \u201cFlash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt,\u201d which claimed markets were rigged to favor high-speed traders. IEX was a private trading venue, known as an alternative trading system (ATS), and the book followed its founders as they set out to build an exchange that would counter the advantages of the fastest traders.  IEX currently executes around 3% of daily stock volume and the majority of its focus has been on protecting hidden orders, but it said the new order type would improve the performance in displayed trading for all market participants.  \u201cWould you want to buy a stock at $10 when less that two milliseconds later you could buy it at $9.99? No one would want to buy it at $10,\u201d IEX President Ronan Ryan said in an interview.  Matching buyers and sellers of stocks is hyper-competitive, with 13 exchanges, including five run by New York Stock Exchange parent Intercontinental Exchange Inc, four by Cboe Global Markets, and three by Nasdaq Inc. Regulators also recently approved a new exchange and two more are pending, and there are around 30 ATSs.  In that fragmented environment, the fastest traders have had an advantage over others.  \u201cFrankly, we\u2019re not able to identify the crumbling quote and get out of the way,\u201d said Mehmet Kinak, global head of systemic trading at T. Rowe Price. \u201cIEX is saying, \u2018hey, the quote is crumbling, you\u2019re not fast enough to do it yourself, we\u2019ll do it for you.\u2019\u201d","221":"BRUSSELS\/LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union will propose a single report on stock market transactions as part of efforts to build a \u201ctruly integrated\u201d capital market after Brexit, an EU document showed on Thursday.

The need to bolster the capital market has been made more urgent by the departure of Britain, Europe\u2019s biggest financial centre, from the EU.  The \u201cvast majority of member states\u201d are still \u201cstrongly opposed\u201d to centralising more supervisory powers in the bloc, the document said.  \u201cWe could emphasise the need to develop a single rule book that would seek the alignment of rules and limit national supervisory discretion in the post-Brexit and multi-entry EU,\u201d the document said.  The European Commission is due to set out its proposals to bolster CMU on September 23.  \u201cIt will also include a careful narrative on Brexit and the need for the EU to develop its own full-fledged, well-functioning and integrated market for capital,\u201d the document said.  \u201cAt the same time, the need for sovereignty would have to be carefully balanced against the imperative to promote an outward-looking EU Capital Market Union that would continue to be attractive to third-country investors.\u201d  There is no consensus so far on how far to reform securitisation.

ESMA eased previous guidance that EU shares must be traded inside the bloc in one respect, saying that shares listed on exchanges inside the bloc can still be traded on platforms in London if they are traded in sterling.  The EU is keen to build up its own capital market to cut reliance on London, and ESMA said trading in a non-EU currency introduced a currency risk for EU investors.  Fewer than 50 EU-listed shares are traded in sterling in London, accounting for less than 1% of total EU trading, ESMA said.  London-based pan-European platforms Cboe, the London Stock Exchange\u2019s Turquoise, and Aquis Exchange trade shares listed on EU exchanges.  \u201cThis revised guidance aims at addressing the specific situation of the small number of EU issuers whose shares are mainly traded on UK trading venues in pounds,\u201d ESMA said.  ESMA said it had done the \u201cmaximum possible\u201d to avoid a clash with Britain over where shares must be traded from January.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that Britain will not be a \u201crule taker\u201d after Brexit, meaning it will not continue to copy the bloc\u2019s rules but will write its own.  The EU began toughening up equivalence conditions after Britain voted in 2016 to leave the EU.

Dark pools, private exchanges for trading securities, are popular with institutional investors who want to execute large transactions without unduly affecting prices. They offer lower costs but are less transparent than traditional \u201clit\u201d stock exchanges which reveal detailed information about a proposed trade upfront, before it is executed.  Britain is keen for the City to remain a competitive global financial hub after access to the European Union was closed off.  Now no longer bound by EU rules that have broadly banned much dark pool trading since 2018, Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced in December that asset managers and other investors could trade near unlimited amounts of shares in the dark.  The FCA paper said the use of trading venues like dark pools with lower pre-trade transparency is associated with lower execution costs.  Critics of dark pools say they give institutional investors an unfair advantage because it\u2019s hard for ordinary investors to see what\u2019s going on price-wise until a trade has been reported, and that such forums \u201cfree ride\u201d on prices created by bourses.  Dark pools argue that exchanges just want to go back to days of national monopolies, and want no competition.  The FCA paper found that reductions in transaction costs also occur when trading in other ways, such as in \u201cperiodic auctions\u201d, when dark trading was banned.  Auctions, which are more transparent than dark pools but less so than traditional exchanges, involve buying and selling shares in batches at set times during the trading day.  \u201cImportantly, after the ban is lifted, we find participant volume moves back to dark pools, implying perhaps that participants prefer dark pools to periodic auctions when both options are available,\u201d the paper said.  \u201cNeither a recent ban on dark pool trading, nor its suspension, significantly affected the transaction costs of investors in the UK equity market.\u201d  The European Union introduced \u201cvolume cap\u201d curbs on off-exchange trading in 2018.

But banking sources say the EU\u2019s executive now sees things differently.  Sources from three international banks fear that access will depend on a broader trade-off such as Britain allowing fishing in its waters -- a concession they feel the government is reluctant to make.  \u201cWe\u2019re now hearing very explicitly -- it\u2019s not even the rumour mill -- the European Commission has said these are politically linked to progress in phase-two negotiations,\u201d one banking source told Reuters.  \u201cAs one official put it to me, if \u2018fish for financial services\u2019 is going badly, this will impact the Commission\u2019s willingness to grant equivalence.\u201d  The fishing industry is valued at about 169 times less than financial services and official data shows it employs just 8,000 people compared to more than a million in finance.  But regaining control of Britain\u2019s rich fishing waters was a totem for Brexit campaigners.  A European Commission spokesman referred to a January EU document saying the bloc and Britain should endeavour to complete equivalence assessments before June 30. He declined to comment further.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The EU is Britain\u2019s biggest financial services export market, worth about 26 billion pounds annually.  Since the 2016 Brexit vote, the sector has reorganised to preserve a foothold in the EU, launching or beefing up subsidiaries and relocating staff and capital. Many banks and money managers are preparing for a further transfer of resources after a transition period ends in December.  Consultants EY said this week that around 7,000 financial services jobs will move from Britain to staff new EU hubs.  Failing to obtain equivalence could add risk-management, compliance, middle and back office roles to that figure, as well as trading and client-facing jobs, the sources said.  Finance minister Sajid Javid said last week that Britain would not be a rule-taker after Brexit, even though some businesses could suffer from regulatory divergence.  He wants \u201coutcomes-based\u201d equivalence in financial services, meaning UK rules need not be identical to those in the EU but should have the same effect.  The EU updated its equivalence policy ahead of Brexit, saying third-country regimes like those in Japan and the United States do not need to be identical but must have the same \u201coutcomes\u201d as EU rules to give access to its markets.  But it would impose tougher scrutiny of \u201chigh-impact\u201d countries, expected to include Britain.  The EU\u2019s withdrawal of share trading equivalence from Switzerland during a dispute over a partnership treaty, not because of any divergence in rules, showed how equivalence can be politicised.  Britain\u2019s finance ministry had no immediate comment.  COST AND SCRUTINY  Bankers say jobs transferred to Europe as politicians wrangle are likely to stay there, even if equivalence is eventually granted.  \u201cThe sector\u2019s approach has always been to prepare in a way for the worst,\u201d a second senior banking source said.  Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, Deutsche Bank DBKGn.de CEO Christian Sewing recognised the risk that a trade deal would not be finalised before end-2020.  He said his bank \u201ccould do everything out of Frankfurt\u201d but that Britain would remain an important capital market.  Financial lobby groups have warned that if Britain does not get equivalence, the government will lose valuable tax revenue.  The bloc is the biggest customer for Britain\u2019s financial services exports, worth about 26 billion pounds annually based on unfettered access.  But lawmakers from Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party say the City could cope with the fallout if negotiations turned sour.  \u201cLondon is a marketplace. The marketplace doesn\u2019t come to them (the EU) ... the health of the City doesn\u2019t depend nearly to the extent that is believed on having some privileged position in the EU,\u201d said Peter Lilley, who sits in parliament\u2019s upper chamber.  A second Conservative lawmaker, Tim Loughton, said Johnson would not consider swapping assets such as fishing rights to cut a better deal for banks, which have struggled to rebuild their image since the 2008 financial crisis.  He said the EU was bluffing and would not politicize financial services because it, too, risked losing access to the region\u2019s deepest markets.  \u201cIt would be a massive exercise in cutting off your nose to spite your face,\u201d he said.","230":"(Adds UBI Banca, Aareal Bank, Watford Holdings)  May 19 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 2000 GMT on Tuesday:  ** UBI Banca has told Italy\u2019s market regulator Consob that a proposed takeover offer by bigger rival Intesa Sanpaolo should no longer be considered as valid, the country\u2019s fifth-largest bank said.  ** German real estate lender Aareal Bank said it was inviting bids from financial investors for a significant minority stake in its Aareon unit to help finance the software business\u2019s future growth.  ** Investment firm Capital Returns Management asked Watford Holdings Ltd to hire an investment bank and consider selling itself as the reinsurer\u2019s stock has lost more than half of its value since January and lags its peers.  ** South Korea\u2019s KB Kookmin Bank plans to take a controlling stake in Bank Bukopin, Indonesia\u2019s Financial Services Authority (OJK) said in a statement, noting the mid-sized lender needed to strengthen its capital and liquidity.  ** Exchange operator Cboe Global Markets said it is buying Canada\u2019s largest \u201cdark pool\u201d stock trading platform, MATCHNow, from Virtu Financial for an undisclosed amount to expand its geographical footprint.  ** Germany and the Netherlands signed an agreement on to strengthen cooperation on electricity grids and look into different options, including Berlin taking a stake in Dutch state-owned power transmission grid operator TenneT.  ** Energean Oil & Gas said it seeks to renegotiate its acquisition of Edison\u2019s upstream portfolio after its plan to immediately sell Edison\u2019s North Sea assets to Neptune Energy fell through.  ** Thyssenkrupp could sell most of its steelmaking division, its CEO said, marking a historic reversal in strategy for the German conglomerate which has built its 200-year-old legacy as an industrial champion of the business.  ** Sony Corp said it will turn its listed financial arm, Sony Financial Holdings Inc, into a wholly owned unit through a tender offer worth about 400 billion yen ($3.72 billion).  ** Israeli defence firm Elbit Systems said the Charlesbank Technology Opportunities Fund invested $70 million in Elbit\u2019s commercial cybersecurity subsidiary Cyberbit.  ** New Zealand media firm NZME Ltd withdrew its application to the country\u2019s Commerce Commission to allow it to buy major competitor Stuff.  ** Dutch bank NIBC Holding NV said late on Monday it has agreed to pay its 2019 dividend to its proposed buyer, U.S. equity firm Blackstone Group Inc, before the deal settles, in order to remove one hurdle to the proposed 1.36 billion-euro ($1.47 billion) takeover.

FILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., December 21, 2016. REUTERS\/Andrew Kelly\/File Photo  The filing, dated Dec. 10, comes nearly two years after another short volatility exchange traded product, the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term ETN, popularly called \u2018XIV\u2019, collapsed leading to billions of dollars in losses for investors.  The Cboe BZX Exchange ETF is designed to track the daily move in the Short VIX Futures index .SHORTVOL index, which itself measures a rolling positioning in the first and second month contracts on the Cboe VIX futures VXc1VXc2, the filing said.  Owning the ETF's share would essentially be a bet on stock market calm. Cboe BZX Exchange is operated by Cboe Global Markets CBOE.Z.  U.S. stocks have risen sharply this year even as daily stock moves have remained muted, drawing interest from investors looking to make money from bets that the calm in equity markets will persist.  Exchange traded products (ETPs) that try to track stock market volatility have seen massive adoption since they were first introduced in 2009. These ETPs offer investors stock-like access to financial strategies that would be typically out of reach for retail investors.  In recent years, investors have poured billions of dollars into ETPs, such as the iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN VXX.P and the VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN TVIX.O.  VXX and TVIX, together have about $2 billion in assets, according to the fund\u2019s website.  Since these products are designed to rise when stocks fall, they provide investors with a way to guard against a hit to equity markets.  The popularity of these ETPs led to the launch of other ETFs that sought to provide inverse returns to stock market volatility.  An extended period of stock market calm in 2016-2017 boosted the returns for these inverse ETPs with assets in XIV - the most popular of these products - growing to about $2 billion.  These products drew criticism when a sudden drop in the U.S. stock market in February 2018 wiped out most of the value of these ETPs and led to the collapse of some products, including XIV.  Demand for shorting volatility remains strong and the demise of XIV has led some investors to take to shorting long volatility ETPs as a way to bet against volatility.  Volatility Shares LLC will serve as sponsor for Cboe proposed ETF, while Tidal ETF Services LLC will serve as its administrator.","232":"A trading screen is seen following the opening of the markets by British Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond and Chinese Vice-Premier Hu Chunhua at the London Stock Exchange in London, Britain June 17, 2019.

The Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE) said shorter hours would be a move in the wrong direction. The current European trading day is 0900-1730 continental European time, longer than in Asia or Wall Street.  This means that share trading spans the Asian market close and the open on Wall Street, and a shorter day could put Europe at a competitive disadvantage to rival trading venues in other parts of the world, FESE said.  The London Stock Exchange, which is not a member of FESE, held a public consultation earlier this year that found broad backing for cutting the trading day by 90 minutes to improve mental wellbeing and help attract more women onto trading floors.  But without a harmonised approach across Europe, the goals of shorter hours would be harder to achieve given banks have pan-European trading desks, the LSE has said.  London will also be leery of putting itself at any competitive disadvantage to rival bourses on the continent now that Britain has left the European Union.  FESE said the length of the trading day does not have a negative impact on the working culture of trading and that other measures like more shifts were necessary to achieve that.  Britain\u2019s Investment Association and the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, a banking lobby, reiterated their calls on Tuesday for a cut in trading hours.

If the application, which was published by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, is approved, MEMX would become the 15th U.S. stock exchange, following the yet-to-be-launched Long Term Stock Exchange, which was granted regulatory status in May.  \u201cMEMX was formed as a result of industry demand for competition, meaningful technical innovation, and increased operational transparency,\u201d MEMX Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Kellner said in a blog post. \u201cWe believe that execution on this charter will deliver needed improvement, catalyze change, and drive better outcomes for the investing public.\u201d  Brokers and traders have complained for years about what they say are unjustifiably high fees charged by most stock exchanges for market data and connectivity.  When MEMX was first announced in January, it pushed down the share prices of Nasdaq and NYSE parent Intercontinental Exchange Inc.  The institutions that fund and control MEMX are some of the incumbent exchanges\u2019 biggest customers, including Bank of America Corp, UBS, Virtu Financial, Morgan Stanley, Fidelity and Citadel Securities.  Online retail brokers Charles Schwab Corp, E*Trade Financial Corp and TD Ameritrade Holdings Corp are also founding members. All three have in recent weeks slashed their trading commissions to zero, pressuring profit margins, and adding appeal to a low-cost bourse.  Around a decade ago, a group of banks backed a low-cost exchange called BATS. Another group of industry heavyweights launched an exchange called Direct Edge with a similar goal of slashing trading costs. The two exchanges quickly gained market share, later merged and are now owned by Cboe Global Markets .  Last year, the SEC asked stock exchanges to do a better job justifying their fees for public market data.

FILE PHOTO: A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly before the closing bell as the market takes a significant dip in New York, U.S., February 25, 2020. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  No case has been confirmed in the state, but dozens of people were being checked in the New York City area on Wednesday.  U.S. stock exchanges said they have contingency plans.  Here is how the markets would work if there were disruptions or panic selling of stocks.  HOW PREPARED ARE STOCK EXCHANGES?  Nearly all U.S. stock trading is done electronically, with only Intercontinental Exchange Inc\u2019s NYSE still operating an open outcry trading floor. But even the Big Board can operate fully electronically if the floor needs to be shut.The exchanges said they are monitoring the situation.  \u201cThe NYSE is carefully monitoring the spread of COVID-19 and has robust contingency plans, tested regularly, to enable continuous operation of the NYSE exchanges should any facilities be impacted,\u201d a spokesman said in a statement.  \u201cCboe has business continuity plans in place for a wide variety of scenarios that could potentially impact operations,\u201d said a spokeswoman for rival exchange operator Cboe Global Markets. \u201cWe are closely monitoring developments related to coronavirus.\u201d  \u201cThe safety of Nasdaq employees, vendors, visitors is paramount. We continue to follow the updates and act and communicate accordingly,\u201d said a spokesman for Nasdaq Inc.  WHAT IF AN EXCHANGE GOES DOWN?  On July 8, 2015, a technical glitch forced the NYSE to suspend trading for several hours, but trading continued as normal on the other 10 U.S. stock exchanges operating at the time.  There are now 13 stock exchanges and another three expected to launch this year, as well as around 30 private stock trading venues run by broker dealers where trading can take place.  In August 2013, a technical problem froze trading in all Nasdaq-listed stocks for three hours, leading the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to call for a meeting of Wall Street executives to insure \u201ccontinuous and orderly\u201d functioning of the markets.  CAN THE ENTIRE MARKET BE SHUT DOWN?  On Oct. 29 and 30, 2012, markets were closed after Superstorm Sandy, the worst storm to hit New York City in nearly 75 years. The NYSE closed its trading floor due to unsafe conditions in lower Manhattan. The exchange had planned to go fully electronic, but with much of Wall Street unprepared for the transition and running on skeleton staffing, traders and regulators felt uncomfortable with the idea and it was shelved. There has been extensive testing since then.  The markets were also closed following the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks until Sept. 17 to avoid panic selling.  HOW LIKELY IS A MAJOR STOCK MARKET CRASH?  On Oct. 19, 1987, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 22.6%, after which the SEC mandated market-wide circuit breakers to ease big market declines.  To prevent another 1987-style crash, trading is paused for 15 minutes if the S&P 500 index falls more than 7% before 3:25 p.m. New York time. If the decline continues after trading resumes, before 3:25 p.m., the market is paused again at 13%. If the decline happens after 3:25 p.m., trading continues. But trading is suspended for the session if the decline reaches 20%.  HOW HAVE THINGS CHANGED SINCE PAST ISSUES?  Technology has made it easier for people to work from home, said Doug Clark, a Toronto-based electronic trading executive who has worked for Virtu Financial, ITG, and BMO Capital Markets. Toronto was one of the first places to experience an outbreak of the SARS virus after it spread from China in 2003.  \u201cWe were all scrambling,\u201d he said. Traders had difficulty accessing all of their trading tools from home, he said, as did exchange executives.  VPN technology has improved greatly since then and working from home is not such a big issue anymore, he said.  The SEC also introduced a rule called Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity in 2014 to hold exchanges to a higher level of emergency preparedness, and the bourses do regular testing of their backup facilities, said James Angel, a Georgetown University finance professor.  But testing has its limits.  \u201cYou can do all the testing you want, but you never know if it\u2019s really going to work until you run it for real,\u201d Angel said.","242":"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s markets watchdog will take a \u201cpragmatic\u201d approach to financial firms that fail to report transactions on time if there is a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31, it said on Friday, given the challenges of adapting to big changes midweek.  Following Thursday\u2019s meeting between the prime ministers of Ireland and Britain, hopes for a divorce settlement have increased.  The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) set out guidance on Friday on what it will do if there is no deal by Brexit day, which is likely to roil investors and markets.  Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union is due to take place on a Thursday.  Typically banks and brokers need a weekend to adapt to such major changes that will affect IT systems used for mandatory reporting of stock, bond and derivatives trades to regulators.  \u201cThe FCA is aware that leaving the EU during the working week could pose operational challenges for firms,\u201d the watchdog said in a statement.  \u201cThe FCA will take a proportionate and pragmatic approach to supervising reporting around exit day.\u201d  A no-deal Brexit would split cross-border stock markets, and the FCA has yet to say how it would respond to this.  If there is a deal, it would be business as usual for Britain\u2019s financial sector during a transition period.  The FCA said firms that are not able to comply fully with securities reporting requirements around Brexit day will need to be able to back-report missing, incomplete or inaccurate transactions as soon as possible thereafter.  For derivatives trades, market participants should have all trades reported to a trade repository no later than Nov. 4.  It echoes comments from the Bank of England which said this week that banks and the broader financial system were well prepared for a disorderly Brexit.  The FCA said it had taken into account statements this week from the EU\u2019s European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which said on Monday there was still a high level of uncertainty as to the final timing and conditions of Brexit.  Many banks, insurers and trading platforms in London have opened hubs in the bloc to ensure continued access for EU customers.  The EU\u2019s European Banking Authority (EBA) said this week that banks must guard against complacency and press ahead with building out their new EU operations.  \u201cNotably, to ensure that assets, appropriate staff and data are in place to support relevant authorizations and that customers are adequately informed,\u201d EBA said.","243":"BRUSSELS\/ZURICH (Reuters) - Investors in the European Union and Switzerland will lose direct access to each others\u2019 stock exchanges from July 1 in an escalating row over a stalled partnership treaty.  Frustrated with Swiss foot-dragging, the European Commission will not propose extending the equivalence regime that lets EU investors trade on Swiss bourses, effectively ending it as of July 1, an EU diplomat told Reuters on Friday.  Friday was the deadline for the Commission to make such a proposal, but it will refrain from doing so because Bern did not endorse a partnership treaty with the EU that had been negotiated for years, the diplomat said.  The move by its biggest trading partner will prompt retaliation from Bern, which last year drew up contingency plans to block by decree trading of Swiss shares on EU-based exchanges.  \u201cShould the EU not extend Swiss exchanges\u2019 access to the EU market Switzerland would activate the protective measures decided on 8 June 2018 with effect from the end of June,\u201d a government spokesman said by email.  The blue-chip Swiss Market Index ended down 0.6% but off session lows shortly before the market close.  BREXIT IN THE BACKGROUND  Bern\u2019s request this month for \u201cclarifications\u201d on three areas - protecting wages, regulating state aid and defining the rights of EU citizens in Switzerland -- is seen in Brussels as demands to reopen the treaty text, which the EU refuses to do.  Granting stock market equivalence is the EU\u2019s major leverage in trying to get the Swiss to finally sign off on the pact, but Switzerland\u2019s foreign minister has said repeatedly Bern will not be rushed into any deal although it remains open for talks.  The Swiss measures could make volume swell on the SIX Swiss Exchange -- Europe\u2019s fourth-largest -- at least temporarily.  Exchange industry officials say EU investors would still be able to trade Swiss shares, but only through a broker that is a member of the Swiss exchange in Zurich, rather than having a choice of exchanges like Aquis, Cboe and Turquoise that help to drive down prices.  These other platforms now account for nearly a third of the trading volume for Swiss stocks including heavyweights like Nestle, Roche and Novartis.  Although the loss of trading access granted under an equivalence regime would also have broad financial repercussions for the 28-country EU, it was seen as inevitable in Brussels after years of inconclusive negotiations.  The hardening of the EU stance is also partly linked to parallel talks under way with Britain over Brexit, as a lenient approach to the Swiss could encourage London to seek softer terms.  The treaty would have non-EU member Switzerland routinely adopt EU single market rules, create a more efficient platform to resolve disputes, and pave the way for new trade deals, such as for an electricity union.  But ahead of Swiss parliamentary elections in October, it has drawn resistance from across the Swiss political spectrum for infringing national sovereignty.","244":"Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Global Markets sign hangs at its headquarters building in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., September 19, 2018.

Market participants say a \u201cconsolidated tape\u201d, or record of transactions, like the one maintained in the United States would give investors a snapshot of prices to check on the best deals in a region where shares are traded on upwards of 20 platforms.  Such an electronic feed could contain information such as prices at which stock trades have been made, and even proposed prices as well.  The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) on Friday closed a public consultation on whether to recommend that the European Commission orders the creation of a regional ticker tape.  ESMA Chair Steven Maijoor said the watchdog has been \u201cexchanging experiences\u201d with U.S. and Canadian regulators, and would send its advice to Brussels before the end of the year.  \u201cAt this stage we want to keep our hands free regarding the direction of our advice, it will also depend on the feedback we are getting,\u201d Maijoor told Reuters.  \u201cIf there would be an interest in going in that direction, it\u2019s also clear that it\u2019s a major project that would require multiple years to implement. It\u2019s a major undertaking.\u201d  Responses to the consultation highlighted the big divide between exchanges and their customers over the cost of data needed to build a consolidated tape.  BREXIT SPANNER  The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), which represents banks, said \u201cpersistent market failure\u201d has led to big increases in the price of data charged by exchanges, and this must be addressed, whether or not a tape was created.  It should be free to modest retail users, AFME said.  A tape would bring benefits to all market participants and was vital for achieving the EU\u2019s goal of a capital markets union, added AIMA and MFA, two funds industry bodies.  The Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE) said increases in data prices have been \u201creasonable and competitive\u201d.  Under the bloc\u2019s MiFID II securities law, exchanges must provide data on a \u201creasonable commercial basis\u201d, a requirement that regulators have not properly enforced, AFME said.  ESMA\u2019s Maijoor hinted that experience on fees gained elsewhere could come in useful.  \u201cLooking into costs is not new to us. We have done this already with credit rating agencies by looking at the fees charged by them,\u201d Maijoor said.  EU laws such as MiFID will not apply to Britain after Brexit, but AFME said that a tape could only provide a full view of trading if it included EU, British and Swiss share activity.  FESE said a lack of UK data could very well question the need for an EU tape.  Maijoor said a separate consultation on a tape for non-equities would take place later on.

Several European Union countries, including Spain, Italy, France and Belgium have banned short-selling, a practice that critics say can exacerbate market moves when there is panic selling.  Short-selling allows traders to borrow a company\u2019s stock with a view to selling it so they can hopefully buy it back later at a lower price and pocket the difference.  In an unusually blunt statement, the WFE, a global umbrella group for exchanges and clearing houses, said stock markets already had safeguards like circuit breakers to slow trading down during bouts of extreme volatility.  \u201cBanning short-selling interferes with price formation, thereby increasing uncertainty,\u201d WFE Chief Executive Nandini Sukumar said in a statement.  \u201cIt is not \u2013 and never has been \u2013 true that bans have any other, positive effect on market activity or price levels.\u201d  Britain has refused to ban short-selling, saying there is no evidence that it is a driver of market routs.

REUTERS\/Bryan R Smith  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some investors are betting that markets will stay turbulent in the coming weeks, after an avalanche of selling in U.S. stocks sent volatility to levels not seen since the financial crisis.  The Cboe Volatility Index .VIX, known as \"Wall Street's fear gauge,\" climbed by more than 20 points above its Friday closing level to peak at 62.12, its highest level since December 2008. Its surge came as the S&P 500 notched a 7% drop on concerns over the spreading coronavirus and a 24% plunge in oil prices. The VIX ended Monday's session at 54.46.  Despite that sell-off, the term structure for the VIX remained inverted on Monday, with shorter-dated contracts at higher levels than longer-dated ones, an indication that investors may be bracing for sustained volatility.  An inversion is sometimes read as a contrarian signal, with U.S. stocks tending to recoup their losses in the weeks after the pattern occurs.  This time around, VIX futures have continued to rise, maintaining the inverted shape of the term structure, as markets have been roiled over the past two weeks.  The current inversion - stretching all the way to seventh-month contracts expiring in September - suggests that investors see enduring risks ahead, said Matt Thompson, managing partner at Thompson Capital Management in Orland Park, Illinois.  \u201cTo us, this indicates this is more of a systemic issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a flash in the pan.\u201d  The sustained rise of the VIX has rewarded investors who had placed bets on a surge in volatility during calmer times.

It was impossible to quantify total benefits but market users say they currently rely on \u201csub-optimal\u201d data, which bumps up costs.  Annual running costs would be 7-9 million euros, funded by membership fees of about 16,000 euros a year on each data aggregator, the study said.

It also runs the largest pan-European exchange operator, as well as options, foreign exchange, and futures exchanges.  The Chicago-based company\u2019s foray into Canada follows a similar move by Nasdaq in early 2016, when it bought a dark pool called Chi-X Canada. In January 2018, Nasdaq won regulatory approval to open a stock exchange in Canada.  \u201cOne thing that we like about Canada is that you can operate as an exchange and you can also operate an ATS at the same time, so it creates a host of opportunities,\u201d Harkins said.

REUTERS\/Michael Hirtzer\/File Photo  Europe\u2019s biggest cross-border share trading platform said if there is no deal, trading in British and Swiss securities will continue on its British platform, but trading in European Economic Area instruments - mainly euro denominated stocks - will cease and shift to Amsterdam.  \u201cIn the event that this happens it is Cboe\u2019s intention to re-introduce trading in European Economic Area instruments on its UK venue during 2019,\u201d Cboe said on Friday.  Cboe said that if there is a long delay to Brexit or that a deal is negotiated, it would not start up in Amsterdam until it is able to offer trading in all securities on both its British and Dutch venues, which is likely to be later in 2019.  This marks a shift at Cboe, which accounts for nearly a fifth of pan-European share trading.  Mark Hemsley, president of Cboe Europe, said in January the exchange would only trade EEA stocks in Amsterdam, with British and Swiss shares limited to London.  This would avoid splitting liquidity in euro, Swiss or UK shares between two centers which could damage prices, he said.  The bloc\u2019s markets watchdog ESMA surprised exchanges last month by saying that if there is a no-deal Brexit, more than 6,200 shares, including 14 British stocks, could only be traded on a platform inside the bloc.  Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority was angered by what one exchange official described as a \u201cland grab\u201d by an EU keen to build up its capital market.  Exchange officials are now waiting to see if the FCA will hit back and rule that under a no-deal Brexit, UK and some European shares could only be traded in Britain.  Cboe\u2019s revised Brexit strategy means that its customers across Europe have a venue to trade all shares.  The London Stock Exchange\u2019s pan-European trading platform Turquoise has set up a hub in Amsterdam, while rival Aquis Exchange chose Paris.  \u201cUp until now, we all believed we would be trading euro shares in Europe and UK and Swiss shares in the UK,\u201d Alasdair Haynes, chief executive of Aquis Exchange said.  \u201cEver since the ESMA share trading obligation (STO) and a potential STO from the FCA, which people think is highly likely to happen, then you are going to have to split liquidity,\u201d Haynes said.  \u201cThis is extremely bad news for end investor, but politically, people want to fight for territory here.\u201d","264":"March 19 (Reuters) - Cboe Global Markets Inc:  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS LAUNCHES BUSINESS CONTINUITY WEBPAGE FOR COVID-19 UPDATES  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS INC - ALL OF CBOE\u2019S GLOBAL MARKETS REMAIN OPEN AND ORDERLY  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS INC - CBOE\u2019S TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS TEAMS CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR TRADING Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","265":"July 31 (Reuters) - Cboe Global Markets Inc:  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS DECLARES INCREASED THIRD-QUARTER 2019 DIVIDEND  * INCREASES QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND BY 16 PERCENT TO $0.36PER SHARE Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","266":"LONDON (Reuters) - The hardline stance by European Union regulators on share trading could split markets and damage prices for investors if there is a no-deal Brexit next week, a top exchanges industry official said on Wednesday.  The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) on Tuesday identified 6,200 shares that EU investors can only trade inside the bloc if Britain left without a deal on March 29.  Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) hit back, saying that ESMA\u2019s stance risked disrupting markets, raising fears of a tit-for-tat move to force UK customers to trade EU shares only in London and thereby splitting liquidity.  Alasdair Haynes, chief executive of Aquis Exchange, said that a \u201chorror story\u201d could be unfolding for markets.  \u201cIs this a land grab? To a certain extent,\u201d he told Reuters.  Launched in November 2013, Aquis now accounts for about 4 percent of pan-European share trading, using a novel form of pricing to take on incumbents such as Cboe, which has more than a fifth of the market.  AHaynes, a 40-year veteran in the industry, said he has never seen such an overt clash between regulators.  \u201cIt was a pretty harsh response,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is regulators fighting in public. Your chances for equivalence went out the door last night.\u201d  Brussels has said that clearing houses in London would gain equivalence for a year if there is a no-deal Brexit, meaning that EU customers could continue using them for a limited time.  This was not extended to trading platforms in London, used by asset managers and banks from across the continent.  Christian Voigt, senior regulatory adviser at trading technology firm Fidessa, said emotions were running high after ESMA\u2019s statement left market participants disappointed.  \u201cWhile arguing what the regulator could have done, we shouldn\u2019t forget that it is all caused by a political decision not to grant equivalence,\u201d Voigt said.  PARIS PILOT  Aquis, Cboe Europe, CME and other trading platforms in London have opened EU operations to avoid disruption to customers from Brexit.  Banks have moved a trillion pounds in assets such as stocks, bonds and derivatives owned by EU customers to hubs in the bloc to trade there.  Aquis began testing trading from Paris on Wednesday, Haynes said.  Trading in euro-denominated shares is likely to remain in London for now if Brexit is delayed, as requested by the British government, or a transition deal is agreed, he added.  The Paris operation would increase overall costs for Aquis by about 5 percent, though most of this has already been incurrred, Haynes said.  Aquis revenue doubled to 4 million pounds ($5.3 million) in 2018, when it made a loss of 2.7 million pounds, having invested heavily on developing its technology and licensing arm. It floated last June with listing costs totaling a million pounds.  Haynes said analysts expect Aquis to become profitable in 2020 and that he is comfortable with those expectations.","267":"BRUSSELS\/ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss exchanges risk losing direct access to European Union investors from July 1 in a potential blow to Switzerland\u2019s financial industry after the bloc said on Tuesday there had been no progress in talks with Bern over a new partnership treaty.  The Swiss government said it will retaliate with measures to defend Swiss stock exchanges if the EU blocks their access to its investors, saying talks on a partnership treaty should not be linked to the so-called equivalence regime.  Swiss-EU relations suffered in 1992 when Swiss voters rejected joining the European Economic Area, leading to a negotiated patchwork of 120 accords that now govern ties. The partnership treaty in question would sit atop those accords.  Although the loss of trading access granted under an equivalence regime would also have broad financial repercussions for the 28-country European Union, it is seen as inevitable in Brussels after years of inconclusive negotiations.  The hardening of the EU stance is also partly linked to parallel talks underway with Britain over Brexit, as a lenient approach to the Swiss could encourage London to seek softer terms, an EU diplomat told Reuters.  European Commissioner Maros Sefcovic told a news conference that the European Commission had at its weekly meeting noted a lack of progress in the talks, which was a precondition for granting an extension to the equivalence regime.  The EU executive therefore offered no lifeline to Swiss exchanges, despite having earlier said that its meeting was the last chance to make a proposal to extend a June 30 deadline.  \u201cIf the European Commission does not decide otherwise, the equivalence decision (on Swiss exchanges) will automatically expire on June 30,\u201d Sefcovic said.  NOT SO BAD?  Bern said in November it would ban trading of Swiss shares on EU stock exchanges if Brussels ended the equivalence regime, which could paradoxically help reduce disruption in trading as shares that are not liquid in EU trading venues can be traded on non-equivalent exchanges outside the EU.  If Bern applied its ban, Swiss shares would no longer be traded in the EU, making them less liquid in the bloc and allowing EU-based banks and investors to continue trading in Swiss exchanges after equivalence expires, an EU official said.  It is unclear how strictly the Swiss would apply the ban, the official added, while another official said that some disruption and higher costs were likely.  Exchange industry officials in London said EU investors would still be able to trade Swiss shares, but only through a broker that is a member of the Swiss exchange in Zurich, rather than having a choice of exchanges like Aquis, Cboe and Turquoise that help to drive down prices.  \u201cIt means you end up with an effective monopoly for a period,\u201d said Alasdair Haynes, chief executive of pan-European trading platform Aquis, which accounts for 6% of daily trading in Swiss shares.  The clash will be closely watched by British regulators who could end up in a similar situation if Britain leaves the bloc without a deal.  \u201cAll this could be a shot across the bows of the UK. By not granting the Swiss equivalence, the EU is talking serious stuff,\u201d Haynes said.  \u201cNO MIRACLE\u201d  Brussels has used the deadline as leverage to convince Bern to endorse a broad partnership treaty that was agreed by the two sides in November and in December temporarily extended the equivalence regime by six months until the end of June, after talks with Bern failed to reach a compromise.  But the Swiss asked for more clarifications last week on several issues, including wages and citizens\u2019 rights.  A diplomat told Reuters that the Commission had effectively decided at Tuesday\u2019s meeting not to extend the equivalence for Swiss exchanges, but will formally announce the decision on Friday after an EU leaders\u2019 summit in Brussels.  Under EU rules it would no longer be possible for the EU Commission to propose an extension after Friday.  The Swiss could still make a last-minute offer before the summit to avoid punitive measures on its bourses, which rely on EU clients, he said. However, this is seen as highly improbable.  \u201cThere will be no miracle,\u201d the diplomat said.  An EU official said the bloc\u2019s states were supporting the way Brussels was handling this issue, signaling that they would not try to force the Commission to a last-minute deal.  In spite of the likely sanctions on Swiss exchanges, Brussels continues to support the ratification of a new treaty governing relations between Switzerland and the EU bloc.  \u201cOur doors remain open to conclude the agreement before the end of this commission\u2019s mandate,\u201d Sefcovic said, underlining however that the draft treaty already agreed with Bern could not be changed. The mandate ends on October 31.  The pact would ensure that Switzerland routinely adopts changes to the rules of the EU single market and provide a better platform to settle disputes. But some Swiss worry it might make it easier to import EU workers and undercut wages.","268":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The three largest U.S. stock exchange operators said they will sue the Securities and Exchange Commission for overstepping its authority by ordering a pilot program to test banning lucrative payments exchanges make to brokers for resting stock orders.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  \u201cWe disagree with the government overreach, and this really represents an unprecedented attempt by the SEC to distort the free market mechanisms that govern the competition among trading venues,\u201d Michael Blaugrund, head of transactions at NYSE, told reporters in New York on Friday.  Intercontinental Exchange Inc\u2019s NYSE, Nasdaq Inc, and Cboe Global Markets, which together operate 13 of the 14 U.S. stock exchanges, each filed separate notices that they intend to sue the SEC. At issue is a pilot program the regulator approved in December that will restrict the amount exchanges can charge for stock trade executions, as well as the rebates exchanges pay brokers for orders that others can trade against, for one to two years.  The program aims to shed light on whether rebate payments, collectively around $2.5 billion last year, create conflicts of interest by incentivizing brokers to send customer orders to the exchanges that pay the biggest rebates rather than to those that would obtain the best results for the end clients.  The exchanges argue rebates are needed to compensate brokers for providing liquidity and that the SEC has not shown that they harm the market.  \u201cThe SEC is required by statute to determine there is a problem, not go on a fact-finding mission,\u201d Ed Tilly, chief executive officer of Cboe, said in an interview on Feb. 8.  Cboe, Nasdaq, and NYSE vigorously opposed the pilot when it was proposed early last year.  They argued it would create winners and losers, as private stock trading venues, which execute around 40 percent of U.S. stock transactions, would not be subject to the restrictions, giving them a competitive advantage. They also said bid-ask spreads would widen without rebates, creating hundreds of millions of dollars in new costs for investors.  The pilot was expected to begin later this year, but NYSE said it will request a delay while it pursues its lawsuit.  The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult decision to decide to take your primary regulator to court,\u201d said NYSE\u2019s Blaugrund. \u201cThat being said, we feel this is overreaching, and we need to draw a clear line in the sand.\u201d","269":"(Reuters) - CBOE Global Markets Inc said it fined a Chicago-based trading firm $1.28 million for submitting improper trades in an auction linked to the VIX index, a gauge of expected future stock market volatility and its best-known product.  According to a letter of consent made public on Friday, Akuna Securities LLC improperly distorted final settlement values for VIX derivatives on three days between November 2016 and November 2017.  The CBOE said Akuna submitted \u201cstrategy orders\u201d composed of Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 options trades, hoping to boost the chance that derivative bets that were part of its strategy orders would be included in final VIX settlement values.  Akuna also agreed to give up $6,726 it made on its trades. It did not admit or deny wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. The CBOE said in a statement the fine did not concern manipulation.  A spokesman for Akuna declined to comment.  Sometimes known as Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge,\u201d the VIX is a measure of expected 30-day volatility for U.S. stocks based on S&P 500 options. VIX derivatives, such as futures and options, expire on the third or fourth Wednesday of every month.

That suspicion gained credence in 2017 when researchers at the University of Texas noted significant increases in trading volumes of S&P 500 index options at the time of VIX settlements.","270":"March 16 (Reuters) - With state and local governments across the United States taking steps to contain the coronavirus spread, including requiring the closing of schools, restaurants and other meeting places, questions have begun to swirl on whether stock markets will shutter.

On Friday, the NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc, issued a trader alert that it aims to keep its equity and options trading floors open \"in the days and weeks ahead,\" even as it asked its staff at 11 Wall Street, not needed to support floor trading, to work from home amid coronavirus concerns.

Chicago-based Cboe, which runs stock and options exchanges, saw record trading volumes across asset classes, and particularly in its proprietary products, which include futures and options on the VIX, which measures the 30-day expected market volatility of the S&P 500.  That helped drive a 43% rise in first-quarter net transaction fees to $253.1 million, which contributed to a 28% increase in overall net revenues to $358.3 million.

In a public consultation paper it also proposed making clear that EU investors could trade UK shares in London in a move to reduce the likelihood of Britain retaliating.  The EU\u2019s MiFID II securities rules introduced in 2018 sought to push more share trading onto transparent exchanges to better protect investors, away from dark pools where users have some degree of anonymity.  The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said on Tuesday that MiFID II has only been partially successful, with tweaks needed to tackle some significant remaining challenges.  ESMA proposed limiting waivers from having to flag the prices at which users intend to trade at on dark pools. Conditions for granting waivers could also be made tougher.  The watchdog is also proposing increased transparency requirements for \u201csystemic internalisers\u201d, a reference to share trading inside banks between clients.  RETALIATION LESS LIKELY  In a step that could make it easier for EU investors to continue using UK trading platforms, ESMA said it was proposing to clarify where EU investors can trade non-EU shares.  Currently EU investors can be obliged to trade foreign shares on platforms in the EU where available, even if there is little volume.  Britain left the EU last week but has a business-as-usual transition deal until the end of December, after which UK platforms will need permission from the bloc to directly serve EU investors.  Permission is now being assessed under the EU\u2019s \u201cequivalence\u201d system that determines if UK securities rules are as robust as those in the bloc.  UK platforms like Turquoise, Aquis and Cboe Europe have opened units in Amsterdam and Paris to trade EU shares in case London gets cut off from the bloc.  ESMA said it makes sense to restrict the ability of EU investment firms to trade EU listed shares on \u201cthird country\u201d or non-EU platforms that are not \u201cequivalent\u201d.  \u201cHowever, with respect to non-EU shares, it appears less appropriate to limit by default the access to third country venues\u201d, ESMA added.  ESMA and Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority clashed over where shares could be traded under a no-deal Brexit, prompting ESMA to rein back a requirement for UK shares to be traded inside the bloc and not in London.  The FCA held back from retaliating and ESMA\u2019s proposed clarification could help smooth relations.

REUTERS\/Peter Nicholls  The LSE said there are no plans for the new Amsterdam offshoot of its Turquoise pan-European platform to start up next month, while Aquis, which set up a hub in Paris, said trading in euro shares would continue in London for now.  \u201cTo do anything else at this point would unnecessarily fragment liquidity and, not surprisingly, there has been no member push for this,\u201d an Aquis official said.  The LSE, Aquis and Cboe Europe, the region\u2019s biggest cross-border share trading platform, created EU hubs in case their London operations get cut off from customers in the bloc after Brexit, which is now due to take place on January 31.  Brexit raised the spectre of London being sidelined in trading euro-denominated shares after transactions in euro-denominated fixed income moved to the bloc in March 2019.  But Britain will now leave the EU with a settlement that includes a transition period to December, meaning continued unfettered access for London-based financial firms.  Cboe Europe has already started up its new Amsterdam hub and although volumes remain negligible, its president David Howson said it will remain open despite the transition period.  Volume in euro shares could start moving from its London unit to the Netherlands if uncertainty over Britain\u2019s direct access to EU investors after transition grows.  \u201cAs things evolve throughout the year, we will get clarity on equivalence (EU market access)... Depending on what that time horizon looks like, we will look to differentiate and induce volumes to potentially go there,\u201d Howson said.  Amsterdam will be a base for building up the U.S. exchange operator\u2019s plans to expand into areas like derivatives trading and clearing in Europe, Howson said. Cboe is buying a pan-European stocks clearing house headquartered in the Netherlands.  POLITICAL HURDLES  Britain and the EU aim to complete assessments on so-called equivalence-based market access for firms like trading platforms and clearing houses by June.  Steven Maijoor, chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), said last week that assessments can be done by the summer, but a decision on access would hinge on wider trade negotiations between Brussels and London.  ESMA had said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, EU investors would have to use EU-based platforms for trading euro denominated shares and derivatives.  There are also other potential hurdles to UK access.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he does not want Britain to align itself to EU rules after Brexit, which could make access for financial firms hard to maintain.  The EU is also keen to build up its own capital market to cut reliance on London and could insist that EU investors trade euro-denominated shares on platforms inside the bloc.  Faced with pressure from EU policymakers, CME and the LSE moved trading in euro-denominated fixed income from London, while UK-based derivatives platforms are also waiting to see how much access they will get to the EU after transition.  \u201cWe would like to see a great deal more clarity in the area of... derivatives trading obligation,\u201d said Roger Cogan, head of European public policy at global derivatives industry body ISDA.  If trading moves, clearing could follow over time, industry officials say, further harming London. So far this has not been the case in swaps, where the LSE dominates clearing for now, although it has shifted clearing in euro repurchase agreements from London to its Paris arm.","276":"Oct 3 (Reuters) - Cboe Global Markets Inc:  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS REPORTS SEPTEMBER 2019 TRADING VOLUME  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS INC - SEPT OPTIONS ADV UP 13.9% OVER SEPTEMBER 2018  * CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS INC - SEPT.

REUTERS\/Michael Hirtzer  Cboe, which has operations in the United States and Europe, and runs stock, options, currency and futures exchanges, said the new platform would include raw market data and derived data from its existing products.  The platform is still in early stages but will eventually \u201chelp fuel the long-term growth\u201d of Cboe, Chief Executive Officer Ed Tilly said on a conference call with analysts.  \u201cThis is a very exciting project for our team and one that leverages unique Cboe strengths, technology, research and development to provide tailored trading strategies for our customers and to inform the creation of new Cboe proprietary products,\u201d he said.  Exchanges have increasingly been leveraging trading data to create new products, such as indices and pricing tools, as well as selling raw data for back-testing algorithms, giving them steady streams of revenue that are less dependent on market volatility than trading revenue.  The growing importance of data to exchanges was highlighted on Thursday, when the London Stock Exchange Group LSE.L formally announced a $27 billion deal to buy Refinitiv, the financial data provider recently spun out by Reuters' parent company, Thomson Reuters.  Chicago-based Cboe\u2019s proprietary products, such as the VIX volatility index - known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge - and S&P 500 options, generate a substantial portion of the company\u2019s profits.  The company said its net income rose to $87.6 million, or 78 cents a share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $82.4 million, or 73 cents, a year earlier, primarily driven by higher trading volume in proprietary products.  Stripping out one-time items like acquisition-related expenses, Cboe earned $1.13 per share, beating the mean estimate of analysts by six cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Net revenue fell marginally to $283.2 million, due in part to a drop in market share in U.S. equities to 15.7% in the quarter, from 18.9% a year earlier.","280":"NEW YORK, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Cboe Global Markets is taking several steps, including recruiting artificial intelligence, to put to rest concerns that its VIX volatility index was prone to manipulation and that contributed to a blow-up of some complex volatility products in February.  WHAT IS THE VIX?  The VIX is a measure of expected 30-day volatility for U.S. stocks based on options on the S&P 500 Index.  VIX derivatives, such as futures and options, expire on the third or fourth Wednesday of every month and their final value is determined by the VIX\u2019s monthly settlement, calculated on expiration day.  The VIX settlement price is calculated using actual opening trade price of a subset of S&P options. If there is no opening traded price for an option included in the calculation, an average of that option\u2019s bid and ask price is used.  WHAT IS THE CRITICISM?  Traders in volatility products have long debated whether the settlement calculation can be influenced by someone artificially raising the price of the options going into the calculation.  These suspicions gained credence in May 2017, when John Griffin and Amin Shams of the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas, Austin, published a paper noting significant spikes in trading volume in S&P 500 index options at the time of the VIX settlement.  Their research showed that just prior to the settlement, there were instances of large option buy or sell orders that did not occur at other times.  While the paper did not rule out all benign explanations, it said: \u201cThe aggregate evidence aligns itself with what one would expect to see in the case of market manipulation of certain settlements.\u201d  Since the paper was published, more than a dozen lawsuits have been filed by various traders who say they lost money due to the alleged manipulation. In general, the lawsuits allege that various parties manipulated the VIX by placing S&P options orders with the intention to move the VIX settlement price.  WHAT IS CBOE\u2019S RESPONSE?  The Cboe says that the jump in trading volume in S&P 500 index options around settlement does not necessarily point to manipulation.  One explanation for the spike in activity could be that traders, who own VIX derivatives about to expire, may be trying to replace the volatility exposure with S&P options.  The exchange says it has since increased the number of participants who can take part in the settlement auction to improve liquidity.  Orderly auctions in recent months soothed some nerves, but investors will be watching future settlements to gauge if the fix is working.  DOES THE VIX NEED FIXING?  Some market participants have suggested that merely increasing liquidity or better policing the settlement auction might not be enough. The Cboe may need to change the VIX formula itself, they say.  The VIX\u2019s reliance on a wide range of traded options, rather than just the ones closest to where the market is trading, leaves the door open to manipulation, they say.  Some traders can influence the settlement price by simply buying a lot of certain S&P options that otherwise would not attract any trading and not be included in the calculation of the VIX price, they argue.

Asset managers and banks in the United States and Europe have long called on regulators to force exchanges to cut the price of data. Bourses say they are not gouging customers.  The FCA said feedback from market participants suggested that some trading venues and benchmark administrators may not face sufficient competitive pressure, allowing them to charge high prices to customers and competitors.  It said it was using a \u201ccall for input\u201d to better understand how data and advanced analytics are being accessed and used, the value offered to participants in wholesale markets, and whether they are competitively sold and priced.  \u201cThe FCA wants to know whether users have concerns with the way trading data, benchmarks and vendor services are priced and sold,\u201d the watchdog said in a statement.  Data includes prices, bid\/ask quotes and volumes of all financial instruments like stocks and bonds.  The Federation of European Securities Exchanges, an industry body, said last year that market data costs have remained stable in recent years, and the real issue was the often low quality of data from off-exchange or \u201cdark\u201d trading platforms.  The FCA said its review would determine if it needed to act, such as by improving competition between data vendors, or making it easier to switch between benchmark providers.  Data has become a revenue driver for exchanges as tougher competition in trading erodes margins.  The London Stock Exchange is buying data and analytics vendor Refinitiv for $27 billion. Refinitiv is 45%-owned by Thomson Reuters, which owns Reuters News.  Under European Union \u201cMiFID II\u201d securities laws, asset managers and banks must show clients they have \u201cexecuted\u201d share trades at the best prices and need data from exchanges for this.  EU markets watchdog ESMA said in December that MiFID II had failed to cut the cost of stock market data, effectively making it uneconomic to build a pan-European feed for investors to compare share prices on different platforms and compete better with U.S. markets.  The EU\u2019s executive European Commission has responded by consulting on possible changes to MiFID II.  Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union in January means that the FCA will have no say in how the bloc intervenes in market data pricing.  Britain cut and pasted MiFID II into UK law ahead of Brexit and would therefore have to make any changes itself.  The FCA noted interventions in the United States, where the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed rules in January to govern data feeds after pressure from banks and asset managers.  The review, which closes in May, will look at firms that the FCA regulates and \u201cconnected, non-regulated activities and firms\u201d and the FCA will set out its next steps in the autumn.","286":"LONDON (Reuters) - Keeping U.S. markets open during the coronavirus epidemic is critical for maintaining investor confidence, exchanges and market industry bodies said in a joint statement on Friday.

The statement was not signed by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) where trading has been halted several times for a few minutes due to extreme price moves.  Top NYSE officials have said the Big Board will continue to work under normal hours electronically despite shutting its trading floor, where dealers operate shoulder-to-shoulder and risk infection from coronavirus.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has suggested a shorter trading day may be needed given the extreme volatility in markets as investors dump shares in the face of an economic downturn due to coronavirus.  \u201cEven persistent rumors about closing the markets are themselves causing adverse effects. Market participants are taking steps, which they otherwise would not, to mitigate against a market closure,\u201d the signatories said in a separate letter to Mnuchin, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Other signatories are the Managed Funds Association, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, American Cotton Shippers Association, Bank Policy Institute, Commodity Markets Council, FIA, Financial Services Forum, Investment Company Institute, Alternative Investment Management Association and the World Federation of Exchanges.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  The Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE) said shorter hours would be a move in the wrong direction. The current European trading day is 0900-1730 continental European time, longer than in Asia or Wall Street.  This means that share trading spans the Asian market close and the open on Wall Street, and a shorter day could put Europe at a competitive disadvantage to rival trading venues in other parts of the world, FESE said.  The London Stock Exchange LSE.L, which is not a member of FESE, held a public consultation earlier this year that found broad backing for cutting the trading day by 90 minutes to improve mental wellbeing and help attract more women on to trading floors.  But without a harmonised approach across Europe, the goals of shorter hours would be harder to achieve given banks have pan-European trading desks, the LSE has said.  The LSE declined to comment on FESE\u2019s statement.  London will also be wary of putting itself at any competitive disadvantage to rival exchanges in continental Europe now that Britain has left the European Union.  FESE said the length of the trading day did not have a negative impact on the working culture of trading and that a better work-life balance could be achieved if companies adopted other measures such as adding more shifts.  U.S. exchange Nasdaq, which operates the Stockholm bourse, said shortening hours would be \u201cmisguided\u201d, and that any change would need to be a pan-European decision that also included off-exchange trading platforms.  Britain\u2019s Investment Association and the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, a banking lobby, reiterated their calls on Tuesday for a cut in trading hours.  Pan-European Exchange Euronext has just completed its own public consultation on market hours. Euronext, which is a vice-president of FESE, has already expressed scepticism about what it has called a \u201cLondon proposal.\u201d"}}
