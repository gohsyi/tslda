(Reuters) - As U.S. corporate jet use approaches pre-financial crisis levels and chief executives take an increasing number of personal trips on the company tab, many investors are being kept in the dark about the true cost of the perk.  FILE PHOTO: A Gulfstream 650ER business jet is displayed at the Gulfstream booth at the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) exhibition in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. October 21, 2019. REUTERS\/David Becker\/File Photo  For the S&P 500 companies that pay for their CEOs to use corporate jets for private trips, the estimated median value of that flying climbed 11 percent last year to $107,286 from $96,532 in 2017, according to the latest available figures from compensation research firm Equilar Inc. That is up 27 percent from $84,636 in 2007, the year before the financial crisis.  This is taxable income for executives. The estimates are often based on what a first-class seat would have cost on a commercial flight rather than on the true, much higher cost of using a corporate jet.  But not only are companies left to pay the full cost of those flights, which can be for anything from family vacations to trips to major sports events or a commute from a distant family home, but they can also find that their tax bills can be significantly higher because of lost deductions.  That is because the U.S. Internal Revenue Service has limited a company\u2019s deductions on personal aircraft use to the estimated valuation of the executives\u2019 flights.  As a result, companies forfeit a long list of tax deductions for the time the jets are used for personal trips, including pilots\u2019 salaries, maintenance costs, insurance, aircraft depreciation and finance charges. Companies usually can deduct the full cost of these expenses when planes are used for business flights.  Exacerbating the issue, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated deductions on two kinds of flights, said Ruth Wimer, a tax expert and partner at law firm Winston & Strawn LLP in Washington. They are for trips taken purely for business entertainment - such as a CEO taking clients to a golf tournament - and an executive\u2019s use of a corporate jet to commute to work from his home, she said.  However, given that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not require disclosure of such lost deductions, investors are none the wiser.  U.S. business jet operations are on track to top 4.5 million arrivals and departures in 2019, the highest since 2007, according to U.S. Federal Aviation Administration data, though only a small percentage are by major company executives.  Popular perceptions of U.S. corporate jet use hit a nadir in 2008 as the financial crisis was worsening. That was when members of Congress blasted the CEOs of the three big U.S. automakers for flying to Washington on corporate jets to ask for financial help.  The fallout was so bad that in the terms of its bailout General Motors Co GM.N was initially barred from corporate jet use.  \u201cBut since then, the whole economy has turned around. The stock market is setting records and jet use has rebounded along with it,\u201d said Nick Copley, president of SherpaReport.com, which analyzes private aviation trends.  GM is back to operating its own corporate aircraft, according to its disclosures.  \u2018HIDDEN ELEMENT OF EXECUTIVE PAY\u2019  The true cost of corporate jets are a mystery for investors in many companies, though.  A Reuters analysis of proxy filings by companies in the S&P 500 found that only a handful detailed the value of lost deductions in their public filings.  Among the few to disclose was payments system and credit card company Visa Inc V.N.. Its lost deductions from the personal use of company jets by executives and their guests have more than quadrupled between 2016 and 2018, and totaled $4.8 million in its fiscal year to September 2018, according to the company\u2019s last proxy statement.  Visa did not reply to messages seeking comment.  Another exception is cable and broadcast TV group Comcast Corp CMCSA.O, which reported $8.8 million in disallowed deductions in 2018 on flights taken by its executives and guests.  Comcast declined to comment.  This is a hidden element of executive pay, said Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of CtW Investment Group, which represents union-sponsored pension funds with nearly 5 million members.  \u201cHaving a better sense of how expensive the C-suite is for the company is a very relevant number,\u201d Waizenegger said. \u201cIf they aren\u2019t disclosed, investors won\u2019t know about these lost deductions.\u201d  While the costs for Visa and Comcast, both with annual net earnings of more than $10 billion, may be a drop in the bucket, lost deductions for smaller companies can have a much bigger impact.  Earlier this year, San Francisco-based hedge fund Voce Capital Management LLC targeted disallowed tax deductions in its campaign to gain board seats at insurer Argo Group International Holdings Ltd ARGO.N.  The hedge fund argued the Bermuda-based insurance company, which had net income of $63.6 million in 2018, was hurting investors by racking up disallowed tax deductions from corporate jets \u201ccrisscrossing the globe at a dizzying pace.\u201d  Argo declined to comment for this story. It has said previously that when its executives use corporate aircraft for personal trips they do so at their own expense. However, it does not disclose how that is calculated or detail any lost tax deductions as a result of personal travel.  Voce has not provided any estimates for lost tax deductions. It did not reply to messages seeking comment.  However, it did outline in a statement earlier this year what it said \u201cmost ordinary people would consider the trip of a lifetime,\u201d by then Argo CEO Mark Watson and his family on an Argo Gulfstream jet during the 2017 Christmas holidays.  The trip began in San Antonio, Texas, with stops in Bermuda, New York, Copenhagen and the Malabar Coast of India, Jaipur in northern India, Amsterdam, and then back to Texas over a three-week period.  The company said in October the SEC was investigating Argo\u2019s disclosures about executive compensation. Within a few weeks, the company announced Watson\u2019s departure.","1":"LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - U.S. cable operator Comcast has formally notifed the European Commission of its intention to bid for Britain\u2019s pay-TV group Sky, a regulatory source told Reuters on Monday.  The formal notification triggers a regulatory process in Brussels that needs to be completed as the U.S. group battles Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Twenty First Century Fox for the company.  The source declined to be named because the process is not public. Comcast declined to comment. (Reporting by Kate Holton Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg)","2":"(Repeats story first published late on Saturday)  LONDON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - A banker from one of Britain\u2019s leading boutique advisory firms pressed the button on Comcast\u2019s knockout $40 billion bid for broadcaster Sky.  The U.S. cable giant emerged victorious on Saturday evening from its protracted battle with Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Twenty-First Century Fox for London-listed Sky with a 17.28 pounds-a-share offer.  That far surpassed the 15.67 pounds-a-share final bid made by Fox, which was seeking to acquire the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own. If Comcast had only offered marginally more than Fox, Murdoch\u2019s company could have fought on for control of Sky because its stake would have given it an upper hand.  \u201cWhen you\u2019re competing against a 39 percent shareholder you\u2019ve got to be quite aggressive,\u201d said a source close to Comcast.  Murdoch\u2019s group was backed by Walt Disney, which has struck a separate deal to buy the bulk of Fox\u2019s television and film assets, including the Sky stake, and which would have eventually taken ownership of the Sky if Fox had beaten Comcast.  The winner was decided by a rare auction process orchestrated by the Takeover Panel, which regulates mergers and acquisition activity in Britain. The Sky takeover is the biggest deal that has ever gone to such a process in the UK.  Brian Roberts, Comcast\u2019s chief executive, was based in a hotel in London\u2019s West End for the duration of the auction, according to a source with knowledge of the matter. He was with a team of advisers that included investment banks Evercore and Bank of America and boutique firm Robey Warshaw.  Bids were submitted to the panel by email to a secure website set up by the regulator and it was Philip Apostolides, a banker at Robey Warshaw, who was responsible for sending the cable giant\u2019s winning offer, according to two sources.  Robey Warshaw declined to comment.  Based in a townhouse in London\u2019s upmarket Mayfair district, the boutique was founded by investment bankers Sir Simon Robey, Simon Warshaw and Apostolides in 2013 and since then has worked on some of Britain\u2019s biggest takeovers.  Comcast has been vying for Sky since February, when it gate-crashed Fox\u2019s deal to buy the London-listed pay-TV group. Fox first agreed to take control of the broadcaster in December 2016 but its takeover was held up by intense regulatory scrutiny in the UK.  To bring the lengthy bidding war to an end, the panel announced on Thursday that it would hold a one-day auction in private lasting a maximum of three rounds, to force the rival suitors to declare their best and final offers for Sky.  Going in to the auction, Comcast had bid 14.75 pounds a share for the British company and Fox had offered 14 pounds.  The auction went the distance, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Fox opened the bidding in the first stage, with Comcast responding with a revised bid in the second round. The level of these bids is not known.  Both bidders could make offers in the third and final round in what were blind bids.

But a challenge to a $52 billion deal he put together six months ago could test his sway with shareholders.  Several Fox investors told Reuters they would be open to terminating the company's agreement, inked in December, to sell most of its media assets to Walt Disney Co DIS.N if Comcast Corp CMCSA.O follows through on its plan, revealed by Reuters last week, to launch a rival all-cash bid for as much as $60 billion.  Murdoch, Fox\u2019s largest shareholder, will be tough to win over, however. His family trust holds a 17 percent stake in the U.S. TV and movie giant and would face a multi-billion dollar capital gains tax bill if he accepted an all-cash offer from Comcast, tax experts told Reuters.  \u201cIf the deal was done exactly the same way, but for cash rather than stock, the tax liability would be mammoth,\u201d said Robert Willens, president of tax and consulting firm Robert Willens LLC. \u201cGains would be taxed at capital gain rates which, for a New York resident, amounts to about 30 percent.\u201d  The exact tax hit for 87-year-old Murdoch cannot be ascertained because details of his trust are not public. A Fox spokesman declined to comment on behalf of Murdoch on his tax affairs and how they would influence deal considerations.  However, sources close to the deal between Disney and Fox said the financial impact on Murdoch would be big enough for him to prefer an all-stock transaction, which would be non-taxable for all Fox shareholders.  That potentially puts Murdoch, who remains the most powerful voice inside the company, at odds with some Fox shareholders who would be open to abandoning the Disney deal if Comcast\u2019s cash offer was high enough.  \u201cI always prefer cash deals,\u201d said Salvatore Muoio, whose New York-based investment firm S. Muoio & Co owns 26,000 shares of Fox, according to Thomson Reuters data. \u201cThe value of a cash deal is certain.\u201d  Other Fox investors said their decision would be based on the price that Comcast offered. \u201cI would have to look at the tax dynamic and what it would mean for my taxable clients,\u201d said Mario Gabelli, chairman and CEO of Gamco Investors, whose firm owns 9.6 million shares of Fox.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Fox's large institutional investors, such as index fund managers BlackRock Inc BLK.N and Vanguard, do not factor in taxes when choosing between cash and stock deals, because they are not taxed on any income they distribute to shareholders, even though this might affect some of their individual investors.  Fox, Comcast, Disney, BlackRock and Vanguard all declined to comment.  MURDOCH V SHAREHOLDERS  Murdoch\u2019s family trust controls 39 percent of Fox due to shares it holds with special voting rights.  However, under the company\u2019s bylaws, those special rights do not apply to a vote on the Disney deal, when the Murdoch trust will only have 17 percent of the vote. That makes it easier for other shareholders to defeat him in the vote, which is expected as early as next month.  Comcast made an all-stock offer for Fox\u2019s assets late last year, before Disney clinched a deal, and is now considering an all-cash offer after the value of its shares declined by 20 percent in the last six months, sources told Reuters last week. Comcast also believes it has capacity to borrow more money, according to sources familiar with the U.S. cable operator\u2019s thinking.  To be sure, Comcast has hurdles to overcome beyond Murdoch\u2019s taxes. Its all-stock bid last November for $34.41 per share was rejected by the board due to antitrust concerns, even though it was higher than Disney\u2019s $29.54 per share offer.  Sources said last week Comcast will make a new offer only if a U.S. judge allows AT&T Inc T.N to proceed with its planned $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc TWX.N, which has been challenged by the U.S. Department of Justice on antitrust grounds.

Although they wield outsized influence on Fox\u2019s 12-member board because of the voting power of the Murdoch trust, Fox still technically has a majority of independent directors on its board.  The only way Comcast could woo Murdoch is by offering a much higher pre-tax price for the deal compared to Disney, Willens said.  \u201cIt is not advisable for a man of Murdoch\u2019s age to engage in a taxable sale of his property,\u201d Willens said. \u201cIf he passed away while still owning the property, his heirs would achieve a basis step-up for the property, thus eliminating, forever, any capital gains tax on the appreciation in the assets that accrued during the scions\u2019 lifetime.\u201d","4":"Feb 11 (Reuters) -  * COMCAST CONSIDERS REVIVING PURSUIT OF FOX AFTER HIGHER BID WAS REJECTED - WSJ, CITING SOURCES Source text: on.wsj.com\/2Bpq55N Further company coverage: ( Bangalore.newsroom@thomsonreuters.com )","5":"Sept 15 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp said on Tuesday that its recently launched streaming service Peacock had signed over 15 million viewers since its launch.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar  The hedge fund, run by Sir Christopher Hohn, owns 7.4 percent of Fox shares and said he disagreed with Fox\u2019s view that Comcast\u2019s bid would come with higher regulatory risk. TCI is \u201cstrongly motivated\u201d to support whichever deal came at a higher price.  The letter highlights shareholder appetite for a continued bidding war between Disney and Comcast over Fox, whose stock traded 1.7 percent higher on Thursday at $49.62, more than $10 above Disney\u2019s revised, roughly $38 per share offer.  Disney, Fox and TCI declined to comment. Comcast could not be reached immediately for comment.  Hohn\u2019s $17.5 billion hedge fund has held stakes in German carmaker Porsche PSHG_p.DE, Airbus Group AIR.PA and aero engine maker Safran SAF.PA, and called for changes to boost their stock prices.  Hohn said a U.S. judge's recent approval of AT&T Inc's T.N agreement to acquire Time Warner Inc is \"unequivocally positive\" for similar deals, such as Comcast's bid for Fox.  He also said the U.S. Department of Justice settlement with Disney earlier this week, which cleared the way for that company\u2019s planned acquisition of Fox, further reduced the regulatory risk for a potential Comcast deal.  Hohn said the timetable for a Comcast deal would be roughly similar to a one with Disney, given the need for either transaction to obtain regulatory approvals internationally.  Disney agreed to buy Fox for $71 billion in stock on June 20, trumping a $65 billion cash bid from Comcast. Disney had originally agreed to buy Fox for around $52 billion late last year.  Fox delayed its planned shareholder meeting, scheduled for next month, to give Comcast time to come back with a higher bid.  The Fox assets in play include a cable group that includes FX Networks, National Geographic and 300-plus international channels plus Fox\u2019s stake in Hulu.  Disney owns ABC, ESPN, Pixar, Marvel Studios and \u201cStar Wars\u201d producer Lucasfilm, plus an array of theme parks.  A deal for Fox would allow Comcast to better adapt to new trends in the pay-TV industry, as consumers abandon traditional cable bundles in favor of web-based offerings such as Netflix Inc NFLX.O.

Peacock will include a mix of NBC series, sports, news and original shows - such as the dystopian drama \"Brave New World\" and documentary \"In Deep with Ryan Lochte\" - as well as content it licenses from ViacomCBS VIACA.O and other networks and studios.  The service will also be available on Sony's 6758.T PlayStation 4 gaming console from July 20, Peacock said on Tuesday. (reut.rs\/3gZfccI)  Unlike the majority of its streaming rivals, Peacock is offering a free, ad-supported version, which will include 13,000 hours of programming. NBCUniversal hopes to lure advertisers through the vast amounts of data it can use to target commercials based on viewers\u2019 interests, including data from Comcast\u2019s cable TV set-top boxes.  Peacock also has two paid options: a $4.99 per month service with commercials and 20,000 hours of programming; and an ad-free version costing $9.99 per month.  NBCUniversal missed the opportunity to market Peacock during its broadcast of the Tokyo Summer Olympics, which were postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak.

U.S. cable television provider Comcast warned last month it expects weaker advertising revenue in its second quarter as sports, which often attracts major TV ad dollars, are postponed during the health crisis. The U.S. TV industry as a whole could see up to $12 billion in lost revenue in the first half of the year, according to research firm eMarketer.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Starting on Thursday, Comcast\u2019s internet customers who use its Xfinity Flex box for streaming apps - its answer to the Amazon Fire Stick and Apple TV - will gain access to the DAZN app, according to Ben King, DAZN\u2019s SVP of Global Distribution and Business Development.  The app will also be available to Comcast cable customers on its Xfinity X1 set-top boxes in time for DAZN\u2019s line-up of high-profile fall championship fights starting Oct. 5. Customers must pay to subscribe to DAZN.  DAZN (pronounced \u201cda zone\u201d) launched in the United States a year ago with John Skipper, former president of Walt Disney Co\u2019s ESPN, as executive chairman.  It is best known for shaking up the boxing world by paying huge sums of money for marquee fighters - including Mexican Canelo Alvarez\u2019s $365 million, five-year contract, which is the largest in sports history.  The deal with Comcast, America\u2019s biggest cable TV provider, is DAZN\u2019s first distribution agreement in North America, but probably not its last.  It is in active discussions in all nine of the countries it is in to replicate the deal with other cable, satellite and internet providers, through a program it calls \u201cDAZN for Operators,\u201d King said.  It already has similar distribution agreements in Switzerland, Italy and Germany. It declined to release subscriber numbers.  Such partnerships will make DAZN \u201ceasier to find, quicker to subscribe to and better to watch,\u201d King said.  For Comcast, including DAZN among its apps could help retain viewers by offering more viewing options. Netflix, Alphabet Inc\u2019s YouTube and Amazon Prime apps are already available to Xfinity customers.  As more viewers cut the cord to pay-TV providers and watch their favorite content on digital platforms, linear television broadcasters and operators have begun launching their own streaming products.  The latest is Disney+, expected to launch in November, while Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal plans an April roll-out of its new service, called Peacock.  Separately, a spate of other digital media companies, starting with Netflix, have launched in recent years.  Partnering with pure digital providers could help pay-TV operators regain some portion of the revenue they have been losing as customers cut the cord.","11":"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co raised its bid for the bulk of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc\u2019s film and television assets to $71.3 billion on Wednesday, sweetening its deal with cash as it looks to upend Comcast Corp\u2019s $65 billion offer.  The new cash-or-stock deal may be attractive to Fox\u2019s largest shareholder, Rupert Murdoch, who owns 17 percent voting shares along with his family. The Murdochs face a large capital gains tax bill under Comcast\u2019s all-cash offer. Disney\u2019s previous offer was all stock.  Fox\u2019s board of directors said Disney\u2019s latest offer was \u201csuperior\u201d to the proposal made by Comcast and would create \u201cone of the greatest, most innovative companies in the world.\u201d  Disney and Comcast want to bulk up their own entertainment businesses with Fox\u2019s well-known TV shows and movie franchises, like the \u201cX-Men\u201d superheroes and \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d to better compete with fast-growing digital rivals Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc.  Fox\u2019s international media companies Star India and European pay TV company Sky TV Plc appeal to Disney and Comcast for overseas growth.  \u201cThese bids are a validation of Fox assets, which can be a big help to someone looking to bring their content business to a global scale,\u201d said Drew Weitz, director of equity research at Omaha, Nebraska-based Weitz Asset Management.  The $800 million Weitz Value Fund owned 550,000 Comcast Class A shares and 450,000 Twenty-First Century Fox Class A shares at the end of March.  Disney\u2019s revised offer of $38 a share, which would be split 50-50 in cash and stock, is $10 a share higher than Disney\u2019s first bid in December 2017. Comcast\u2019s last bid was for $35 a share in cash.  Disney will also take on about $13.8 billion of Fox\u2019s net debt, implying a total transaction value of about $85.1 billion.  The latest move by Disney raises the hurdle for Comcast, which has to decide whether it is feasible to counter with a higher bid.  A Comcast representative declined to comment, but analysts and investors widely expect a counterbid from the largest U.S. cable company and owner of NBC Universal.  \u201cComcast has to come in with a higher bid,\u201d said Mario Gabelli, chairman and chief executive officer of Gamco Investors which owns 10.1 million Fox shares. \u201cThey are out of the game right now!\u201d  FOX SHARES JUMP 8 PERCENT  Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger played down any antitrust concerns in a deal, and said he has been working with regulators around the world for the past six months.  \u201cWe believe that we have a much better opportunity both in terms of approval and the timing of that approval than Comcast does in this case,\u201d Iger said.  Quoting Bloomberg News, CNBC reported that Disney was nearing U.S. Justice Department approval on the deal. Disney declined to comment immediately on the report.  Comcast may face tougher regulatory scrutiny if the deal involves any transfer of television licenses, which would trigger an Federal Communications Commission review, said Ketan Jhaveri, a former Justice Department attorney who served on its telecommunications task force for internet policy.

The European pay-TV group, 39 pct owned by Fox, is also being pursued by Comcast.  Major sports and news assets including Fox News, Fox Business Network and Fox Sports are not part of the businesses being sold and would be spun off into a separate company.  Following the deal, Fox shareholders would own about 19 percent of the combined company, Disney Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said on a conference call.  Disney no longer expects to complete the $20 billion share repurchase announced in December, McCarthy said.  Fox said it will postpone a special shareholders meeting in order to provide stockholders with an opportunity to evaluate Disney\u2019s amended offer.","12":"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co said it will take full control of the Hulu service in a deal with Comcast Corp, as it vies for a bigger piece of the global video streaming market dominated by companies such as Netflix Inc.  The agreement, which ascribes a minimum equity value to Hulu of $27.5 billion, allows either company to trigger a sale or purchase of Comcast\u2019s 33% stake to Disney as early as January 2024. Comcast has also agreed to fund Hulu\u2019s recent buyout of AT&T\u2019s 9.5% interest in the company.  By establishing an expiration date of five years from now, Comcast is betting the value of its stake will nearly double or more without any more additional financial obligations.

To preserve the ability to run NBCUniversal programs on its own service, NBCUniversal will have the option to offer some of the shows it currently licenses exclusively to Hulu in one year\u2019s time in exchange for lower license fees. NBCU will also have the option to end most of its licensing agreements with Hulu in three years.  Shares of Disney closed up 1.4% at $133.21 on the New York Stock Exchange. Comcast shares rose 1.5% to $42.91 on Nasdaq.  Last month, Hulu said it had bought back telecommunications and media company AT&T Inc\u2019s stake in the U.S. entertainment streaming service for $1.43 billion, in a deal that valued Hulu at $15 billion.

FILE PHOTO: Comedian and producer Byron Allen leaves the Supreme Court after it heard Comcast's bid to evade a civil rights lawsuit he filed against the company, in Washington, U.S. November 13, 2019. REUTERS\/Lawrence Hurley\/File Photo  The nine justices unanimously sent the case back to the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider whether Allen\u2019s claims that his failure to land a deal for Comcast to carry channels that he owned was due to racial discrimination were enough to let the case proceed. Allen is black.  The justices ruled that the 9th Circuit assessed Allen\u2019s claims using the wrong test. \u201cTo prevail, a plaintiff must initially plead and ultimately prove that, but for race, it would not have suffered,\u201d conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, an appointee of President Donald Trump, wrote for the court.  Allen sued Comcast in 2015 in federal court in Los Angeles, making claims under the Civil Rights Act of 1866, a post-Civil War law that forbids racial discrimination in business contracts. It requires all people to have the same right to make and enforce contracts \u201cas is enjoyed by white citizens.\u201d  Comcast, backed by Trump\u2019s administration in the case, refused to carry channels operated by Entertainment Studios, owned by Allen.  Allen called the ruling harmful to the civil rights of millions of Americans.  \u201cThis is a very bad day for our country,\u201d Allen said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue our fight by going to Congress and the presidential candidates to revise the statute to overcome this decision by the United States Supreme Court.\u201d  Comcast argued that a plaintiff must show early on in a case that a contract was denied solely because of racism or the lawsuit must be tossed.

Comcast has said it rejected Allen\u2019s channels due to capacity constraints, not race, and that Allen\u2019s channels - which include Cars.TV and Comedy.TV - did not show sufficient promise or customer demand to merit distribution. Allen\u2019s company acquired the widely available Weather Channel TV network in 2018, after the case had begun.  Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said, \u201cNo doubt, this ruling may shut the courthouse door on some discrimination victims who, at the complaint stage, may simply be without the full range of evidence needed to meet the court\u2019s tougher standard.\u201d  Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined Monday\u2019s ruling but wrote that when the 9th Circuit reassesses the case, \u201cif race indeed accounts for Comcast\u2019s conduct, Comcast should not escape liability for injuries inflicted during the contract-formation process.\u201d  Allen\u2019s similar suit filed against Charter Communications in 2016 will be guided by Monday\u2019s Comcast ruling.  Allen primarily blamed racial discrimination for the rejections, accusing cable executives of giving insincere or invalid excuses and granting contracts to white-owned networks during the same period. Other distributors, including Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Inc and DirecTV, carried some of Allen\u2019s programming at the time, court papers said.  The court issued this ruling and three others online due to coronavirus pandemic rather than its usual practice of having the justices announce opinions in their courtroom.","21":"LONDON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Two hedge fund shareholders in Sky say Comcast Corp\u2019s $31 billion offer for the British pay-television broadcaster is likely to trigger a higher counter bid for the FTSE 100 company.

But with films like \u201cMatrix 4,\u201d \u201cIn the Heights\u201d and \u201cDune\u201d hitting TVs at the same time as theaters, and Marvel series \u201cThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier\u201d and \u201cLoki\u201d streaming on Disney+, will they even want to?  The pandemic accelerated a push to subscription streaming video services like Netflix and Disney+ that was already underway, leading to a surplus of top-shelf content being available to consumers in 2021. But behind the scenes of this new golden age of television is a battle over the future of Hollywood.  2020 was the year major media companies placed their bets, with AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Walt Disney Co announcing new strategies around how and where they will distribute content. While their approaches vary, they are united by a singular focus on streaming video to appeal directly to viewers.  Less clear is who will emerge victorious once the pandemic is over. Will the experience of watching a film in a theater - with a community of fans, a giant screen and enveloping sound - trump the convenience and lower cost of watching it at home?  The answer will help decide the future of Hollywood in 2022 and beyond.  AT&T\u2019s Warner Bros studio took the boldest step of its peers when it announced plans to debut all of its 2021 films in theaters and on the HBO Max streaming service on the same day, including potential blockbusters like \u201cMatrix 4,\u201d \u201cThe Suicide Squad,\u201d \u201cDune\u201d and \u201cIn the Heights.\u201d It is releasing \u201cWonder Woman 1984\u201d in theaters and on HBO Max on Dec. 25.  Warner Bros said the strategy, which AT&T Chief Executive John Stankey described as a \u201cwin-win-win\u201d for consumers and partners, would stay in effect for one year.  \u201cI don\u2019t know why they had to decide about the whole year,\u201d said \u201cWonder Woman 1984\u201d director Patty Jenkins in an interview with Reuters. \u201cI wish we could have waited and seen what was happening with theaters.\u201d  Comcast\u2019s Universal Pictures took a less drastic approach, chipping away at the theatrical window through deals with three major theater operators - AMC Entertainment Holdings and Cinemark Holdings Inc, and Canada\u2019s Cineplex.  The parties agreed to shorten the window between a film\u2019s theatrical and at-home release. After as few as 17 days in theaters owned by one of those operators, Universal could make films such as \u201cSing 2\u201d or \u201cMinions: The Rise of Gru\u201d available on digital platforms for $19.99.  Rather than announce sweeping changes to its movie release strategy, Disney opted to super-charge its streaming services. The company plans to release 10 new TV series each in the Marvel and Star Wars franchises, including two spinoffs of \u201cThe Mandalorian,\u201d on the Disney+ streaming service over the next few years.  It will make another 15 live-action Disney Animation and Pixar shows and 15 Disney Animation and Pixar feature films available on the service.  Customers should expect about 100 or more titles on Disney+ every year, executives said on Dec. 10. To help fund the $16 billion Disney is planning to spend on new content in fiscal year 2024, in March 2021 Disney will raise the price of Disney+ by $1 in the U.S. to $7.99 per month and by 2 euros in continental Europe to 8.99 euros ($10.92).  In early 2021, ViacomCBS is rebranding its CBS All Access streaming service as \u201cParamount+\u201d - which will include episodes and movies from ViacomCBS-owned brands such as Comedy Central and Paramount Pictures, including series such as \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d and \u201cThe Good Fight.\u201d  These changes may not have happened as quickly without the pandemic, although some Hollywood insiders consider them inevitable.  \u201cWithout a doubt, we are into the big curve of change that I think has been due ever since people first had (premium video on demand),\u201d actor Tom Hanks said in December. \u201c(Arguably) since the VHS cassette tape was first introduced in a cheap way, this has been just across the horizon.\u201d","23":"FILE PHOTO: Sky parabolic antennas are seen on roof of the Sky Italia buildings on the outskirts of Milan, Italy, April 27, 2016.

REUTERS\/Benoit Tessier  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Comcast boss Brian Roberts already made a bid for parts of Twenty-First Century Fox, and failed. Now he has left the door ajar for another lurch. It would be better to walk away.  Roberts seems to be in the mood for mergers. He confirmed on Wednesday morning a $31 billion offer for European pay-TV company Sky. That\u2019s 16 percent higher than an offer already made by Fox, which is trying to buy the 61 percent of Sky it doesn\u2019t already own in order to then sell the whole thing to Walt Disney. Second, Roberts promised during an earnings call not to use the company\u2019s sagging shares as an acquisition currency \u2013 but pointed to the strength of Comcast\u2019s balance sheet, in a strong signal that he is open to further deals funded by cash.  Pledging not to use stock for deals is fair enough. Shareholders often don\u2019t like dilution. But the risk is that Roberts might be tempted to reprise his bid for some other bits of Fox, which Disney has agreed to buy for $66.1 billion including debt. Comcast tried that once before, but was knocked back by Fox\u2019s chairman and presiding shareholder, Rupert Murdoch.  Here\u2019s why Roberts ought to refrain. The Fox assets might make $3.8 billion in operating profit in 2018, taking Bernstein EBITDA divisional estimates and assuming operating profit is split among the Fox businesses in the same proportions. Assume Comcast can drive out $1.5 billion of savings, less than Disney\u2019s estimate of $2 billion, and the total hits $5.3 billion. Tax that, and for a deal valued at $66 billion, Comcast\u2019s return on investment would be about 6 percent. And that\u2019s even if Comcast matches, rather than tries to best, Disney\u2019s offer.  True, Roberts would be saving Disney from itself. The Magic Kingdom\u2019s return on investment, even with higher cost savings, is still below 8 percent. But that\u2019s no consolation to Comcast shareholders, who would be left with a value-destroying deal. Fox originally swatted away Comcast\u2019s offer because of regulatory risk, and it\u2019s unlikely Murdoch would have wanted to hold shares in a company Roberts controls. Comcast should thank him \u2013 because trying again, even in cash, would simply be a bad idea.","25":"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp CMCSA.O on Thursday reported better than expected third-quarter revenue, as strong sign-ups for broadband offset pandemic-related weakness in its theme park and filmed entertainment businesses.

But coronavirus restrictions have also given a big lift to services - like broadband and streaming video - that are in high demand due to people working from and staying at home.  The company\u2019s NBCUniversal segment, which includes NBC Entertainment and Universal Pictures, reported revenue of $6.72 billion, down 18.9% from a year earlier. Revenue at the filmed entertainment unit fell 25% from a year earlier due to shuttered movie theaters. Theme park revenue plummeted 80.9%.  The company said on Thursday that it expects its theme park business to break even at some point in 2021, regardless of whether its California park reopens. It reiterated plans to open its new Beijing park by the summer of 2021.  Comcast said it had 22 million sign-ups to its recently-launched Peacock streaming service.

The biggest U.S. cable provider also shed 140,000 video customers during the second quarter, up from 34,000 customers lost in the prior-year quarter, as TV viewers move to a growing number of cheaper streaming options, such as AT&T Inc\u2019s newly-launched WatchTV at $15.  Net income attributable to Comcast rose 27.6 percent to $3.2 billion, or 69 cents per share, from $2.5 billion, or 52 cents per share, a year earlier.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  (Reuters) - Comcast Corp is pooling the advertising power of its NBCUniversal and British-based Sky units to better target viewers worldwide, it said on Monday, a major step by the top U.S. cable TV provider to transform itself into a global media leader.  The initiative would allow global advertisers to target specific households based on their interests, widely seen as the future of TV advertising. It comes ahead of an important ad sales period in May called the upfronts, when major U.S. networks including NBC will tout upcoming shows and advertising technology in hopes of selling commercial time in advance of the next television season.  The AdSmart service offers the strengths of NBCUniversal\u2019s artificial intelligence in media planning, and Sky\u2019s long experience in targeting ads to households based on their interests. Comcast paid $40 billion for Sky, a satellite TV, broadband and mobile operator, in September to fuel global growth and counter declines in U.S. cable TV subscribers.  The service would ultimately allow global advertisers to automatically place ads on the most relevant shows, and measure the results across NBCUniversal and Sky\u2019s TV and digital platforms as advertising becomes more global. \u201cThe strategy is no longer country by country or market by market,\u201d said Jamie West, group director of advanced advertising for Sky, in an interview. \u201cIt eases the friction of purchasing across NBCUniversal and Sky.\u201d  Showing viewers ads that more closely match their interests improves the viewing experience, and is ultimately better for marketers, said Linda Yaccarino, chairman of advertising sales and client partnerships for NBCUniversal, in an interview.  NBCUniversal, which includes CNBC and U.S. Spanish language network Telemundo, uses AI to scan scenes in a TV show to place an ad in the optimal spot, a strategy called contextual alignment. For example, if a TV show depicts a flooded home, the AI-powered system could insert an ad for a home insurance provider.","32":"Jan 23 (Reuters) - Top U.S. cable services provider Comcast Corp reported quarterly revenue above analysts\u2019 estimates on Wednesday, buoyed by lower-than-expected video subscriber losses and growth in its broadcast television and theme parks businesses.

Revenue from broadcast television dropped 29.4 percent to $2.47 billion, though the company also broke out figures that showed revenue rose when excluding 2018 Olympics and Super Bowl from the prior-year comparison.  Comcast, which bought the British pay-TV group Sky last year, said revenue reported from Sky was $4.8 billion.  Net income attributable to Comcast rose to $3.55 billion, or 77 cents per share, from $3.12 billion, or 66 cents per share a year earlier.

They say that Comcast routinely violates Antitrust Laws,\u201d Trump said on Twitter.  Comcast\u2019s shares dipped following the president\u2019s tweet but quickly recovered most of their losses in a market that was broadly lower. Comcast shares were down about 0.2 percent in late trading.  It is not the first time that Trump has weighed in on regulatory issues related to media companies.  In July, he said the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s decision to reject Sinclair Broadcast Group\u2019s purchase of Tribune Media was \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d Two years ago, when Trump was the Republican presidential candidate, he had denounced AT&T Inc\u2019s deal to buy Time Warner Inc, whose businesses included CNN, which Trump has repeatedly attacked.  The ACA said in its call for a probe that with the expiration of requirements that were imposed on Comcast following its 2011 acquisition of NBC Universal, its \u201cability to raise programming prices in local markets is unmatched by any similar problem created by the AT&T-TW combination.\u201d  The ACA said it was particularly concerned about its members\u2019 access to regional sports networks.  \u201cACA expects \u2013 and there is every reason for DOJ (Justice Department) to expect -- Comcast-NBCU to act on its natural incentives and use its capabilities to harm rivals, unless the government somehow, either through structural or behavioral remedies, deals with them,\u201d the group said in its letter.

Comcast is battling Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Twenty-First Century Fox for Sky. The media mogul bid\u2019s to buy all of Sky has been delayed by politicians and regulators worried about the power of the enlarged media group.  The European Commission, which is scheduled to decide on Comcast\u2019s offer by June 15, did not respond to a request for email. It cleared without conditions Fox\u2019s bid for Sky in April last year. Comcast declined to comment.","40":"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. cable operator Comcast CMCSA.O has formally notified the European Commission of its intention to bid for Britain's pay-TV group Sky SKYB.L, starting the clock on a review, a regulatory source told Reuters on Monday.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Comcast is racing to get ahead of Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA.O in the battle to buy the European company, and the notification in Brussels is a key requirement.  The Commission can clear the 22 billion-pound ($30 billion) bid with or without conditions or it can open a four-month investigation if it has serious concerns about the deal. The deadline for a decision is June 14.  Comcast, the world\u2019s biggest entertainment company, stunned the industry in February when it made an informal bid for Sky, taking on Fox which is in the final stages of its own bid to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own.  Comcast made its bid formal in April and the notification in Brussels starts the clock on the regulatory review. It is keen to show Sky\u2019s investors that it can get through the regulatory process quickly, unlike Fox which has faced repeated delays since it first agreed a takeover of Sky in December 2016.  The Fox-Sky deal has been held up by concerns about the influence Murdoch could wield over public opinion through owning all of the broadcaster as well as British newspapers The Times and The Sun.  Fox has offered a raft of remedies to gain regulatory approval, such as protecting the independence and funding of Sky\u2019s news division.  The original Fox-Sky combination has also been further complicated by Fox\u2019s agreement to sell many of its TV and film assets to Walt Disney Co DIS.N, including its stake in Sky, for $52 billion (37 billion pounds).  Comcast has so far made the higher offer, at 12.50 pounds a share compared with Fox\u2019s 10.75 pounds. Investors in Sky expect Fox to return with a higher offer if it can secure approval from Britain\u2019s media secretary, who is reviewing that bid.  The regulatory source declined to be named because the process is not public. Comcast declined to comment.","41":"LONDON (Reuters) - Sky SKYB.L shares leapt to an 18-year high on Thursday as investors bet a transatlantic battle for the European pay-TV group had further to run, after Comcast's $34 billion bid trumped an offer from Rupert Murdoch made just hours earlier.  Comcast CMCSA.O, the world's biggest entertainment group, said on Wednesday it had the backing of Sky's independent directors for a 14.75 pounds-per-share offer that came just 16 hours after Murdoch's 21st Century Fox FOXA.O bid 14 pounds.  The speed with which Comcast\u2019s Brian Roberts counterbid shows how determined he is to buy Britain\u2019s Sky, a broadcaster of sports, films and TV shows to 23 million homes across Europe.  Sky\u2019s shares rose to as high as 15.41 pounds on Thursday and were trading at 15.37 pounds in late afternoon, valuing it at 26.4 billion pounds - or $35 billion - as investors bet the bidders would have to pay more to secure victory.  \u201cYou need a finale at the end of a great bull market and I think Sky is going to be that finale,\u201d said Crispin Odey, a top 20 Sky shareholder, noting the share\u2019s rapid ascent.  \u201cIt\u2019s got legs,\u201d he added.  Sky\u2019s shares are up 95 percent since Fox made its first bid in 2016, and have risen 55 percent in the last year.  The fight is part of a bigger battle being waged in the entertainment industry as the growth of Netflix NFLX.O and Amazon AMZN.O force the world's traditional media giants to spend tens of billions of dollars to keep pace.  Comcast and Walt Disney DIS.N are locked in a separate $70 billion-plus battle to buy most of Fox's assets, including Sky, and Disney is backing Murdoch in his pursuit of the UK firm.  Murdoch owns 39 percent of Sky, which he helped to launch.  The standoff pits the industry\u2019s biggest names against each other, with Roberts, the Murdoch family and Disney\u2019s Bob Iger engaged in a multibillion-dollar game of chess to reshape the global entertainment business.  The three are at a tech conference in Sun Valley, Idaho. They have history, after Roberts\u2019 Comcast tried and failed to buy Iger\u2019s Disney in 2004.  WINNER TAKES ALL?  Analysts are divided as to who will emerge triumphant.  Jeff Wlodarczak at Pivotal Research Group said Comcast may succeed in winning Sky but lose out on Fox to Disney.  Richard Greenfield at BTIG said, however, he thought Disney needed to buy Sky to secure a direct relationship with customers in Europe so it could sell them its vast range of programming.  \u201cIs Disney willing to let Sky go? Or will they crush Comcast on both continents?\u201d Greenfield said in a note.  \u201cWe continue to believe that if Comcast really wants to own Sky, their best way to do it is by acquiring the Fox assets \u2013 winner takes-all was always the scenario that appeared most likely to us.\u201d  Fox investors vote on Disney\u2019s $71 billion bid on July 27.  Comcast, which made a $65 billion all-cash offer for the Fox assets last month only for Disney to raise its bid, would need to return before that date if it wants to try again.  That means the next installment of this drama is likely to move to the United States.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cIt\u2019s not clear to me that Disney would allow Comcast to get Sky at 14.75 pounds in order to definitively get hold of Fox when they are really in the driving seat,\u201d a London-based hedge fund manager with shares in Fox and Sky told Reuters.  A second fund manager invested in Sky questioned whether Comcast was seeking to force Fox and Disney to do a side deal and sell it some Fox assets in order to end the bidding war.  \u201cFor Comcast bidding for the whole of Fox it\u2019s now too expensive, so they\u2019re focusing their bidding efforts on Sky,\u201d the fund manager said on the condition of anonymity.  \u201cAnd because Murdoch and Disney are determined to take control of Sky, they will have to reach an agreement with Comcast in relation to other Fox assets.\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  MORE TO COME  Analysts at Jefferies said they thought Comcast, if required, could yet offer more. Comcast said the offer values Sky on a price to earnings multiple of 22.9 times 2017 earnings.  Jefferies see this multiple falling rapidly as Sky\u2019s earnings improve, helped by lower Premier League soccer costs from 2019. When factoring in synergies, it says the offer equates to around 12.57 pounds to Comcast, implying a multiple of 15.3 times Sky\u2019s forecast 2020 earnings, and falling thereafter.  Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with New Street Research, said he believed Comcast could bid up to 16.00 pounds per share for Sky, and assumes Comcast will go this high if pushed.  \u201cOf all the assets in the Fox portfolio, they probably view Sky as the most strategically important,\u201d Chaplin wrote.  In Britain, a 60-day timetable is set in motion once the second of the two bidders has published its offer document. If there are still two live competing bids by day 46 of the timetable, the Panel can run an auction process.  For now, investors are waiting to see what Murdoch will do next. Fox released a terse statement late on Wednesday saying it noted Comcast\u2019s offer. It received UK regulatory approval to buy Sky on Thursday - almost 20 months after it requested it.  The government had repeatedly delayed its approval for fears that Murdoch, the owner of two of the biggest selling newspapers in Britain, would control too much of the media.  Murdoch helped to launch Sky in 1989, building it up to be Britain\u2019s dominant pay-TV provider through its ownership of Premier League soccer, U.S. drama and films. It now offers satellite TV in Ireland, Austria, Italy and Germany, and streaming services in Spain.  His son James is CEO of Fox and chairman of Sky.  \u201cThere is the question of whether Disney and Comcast are paying over the odds for Sky,\u201d said senior analyst Laith Khalaf at Hargreaves Lansdown.  \u201cHowever, Sky investors won\u2019t worry too much about that.\u201d ($1 = 0.7571 pounds)","42":"March 7 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp:  * COMCAST AND NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO TO LAUNCH NPR ONE APP ON XFINITY X1 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","43":"FILE PHOTO: The NBC and Comcast logo are displayed on top of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, formerly known as the GE building, in midtown Manhattan in New York July 1, 2015.

FILE PHOTO: The Sky logo is seen outside an entrance to offices and studios in west London, June 29, 2017.

The situation is further complicated by a $52 billion deal agreed in December 2017 by Walt Disney Co to buy Fox assets, including its 39 percent Sky stake. Disney has previously said it expects the sale of Sky to Fox to complete before it acquires the Fox assets, meaning it would assume full ownership of the British company.  Hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, who has long argued that Fox\u2019s takeover proposal is too cheap, told Reuters the bid from Comcast, the biggest U.S. cable operator, was \u201cfantastic\u201d and that a counter offer was now likely.  Disney could bid directly for the British pay-TV company instead of Fox, which has faced regulatory obstacles to its Sky offer, said Odey, who is a former son-in-law of Murdoch.  \u201cOnce you\u2019re in a bidding war, it\u2019s not about fair value, it\u2019s about what do you think it\u2019s worth,\u201d Odey added.

Sky shares were up 20.4 percent at 13.30 pounds at 1203 GMT on Tuesday, indicating that investors are speculating the broadcaster will fetch a higher price than Comcast has offered.","46":"LONDON, March 9 (Reuters) - Comcast\u2019s gatecrashing of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s eight-year campaign to buy pay-TV group Sky has sparked a regulatory race with 21st Century Fox .  Fifteen months after finally agreeing a takeover of Sky, Murdoch had been edging towards approval by offering remedies to overcome long-held concerns that he holds too much media sway in Britain, where he owns the Sun and Times newspapers.  But Comcast, the owner of NBC and Universal, has made investors a higher offer with no political baggage for a business that Murdoch helped to launch and owns 39 percent of.  Fox has called on regulators to submit Comcast to the same lengthy scrutiny it received, but competition lawyers say it could gain clearance in a relatively fast probe.  COMCAST\u2019S OFFER  Comcast offered 12.50 pounds per share, or 22.1 billion pounds ($31 billion). It has not yet made a firm bid and is sounding out investors through its brokers, BAML, sources say.  It wants to own all of Sky but will accept taking control with 50 percent plus one share if Fox decides not to sell its 39 percent stake. Fox has a separate deal to sell assets to Walt Disney, including Sky.  FOX\u2019S OFFER  Murdoch agreed to buy the 61 percent of Sky it did not already own in December 2016 for 10.75 pounds per share, valuing the entire business at 18.5 billion pounds.  This followed a failed attempt to buy Sky in 2010, which collapsed when journalists at one of Murdoch\u2019s papers admitted hacking into phones to secure news, sparking a criminal trial, a public inquiry and questions over his role.  LEVEL OF ACCEPTANCE  One person familiar with the matter said Comcast was asking hedge fund managers how much Sky stock they controlled, indicating a belief that Fox will hold on to its stake and setting the stage for a lengthy battle.  UBS said the price could go as high as 1400-1500 pence.  Comcast will need 82 percent acceptance from independent Sky shareholders while Fox is targeting 75 percent, meaning 15 percent of independent investors could block the deal.  COMCAST\u2019S REGULATORY CHALLENGE  Comcast is providing information to the European Commission and believes it can get approval in the so-called Phase 1 of the investigation, avoiding a prolonged process. It could take several weeks before Comcast files a formal notification.  Brussels will examine whether a Comcast-owned Sky could be anti-competitive when dealing with rival channels on its platform and whether there is a threat from putting Sky in the same company as film studio Universal.  The regulator could also consider if Sky would be owned by companies holding three of the six major film studios if Comcast owns 61 percent and Walt Disney retains Murdoch\u2019s 39 percent.  Comcast would argue that were Fox or Disney to retain 39 percent, they would be a financial investor with no commercial or operational link with Sky.  In terms of previous conduct, Comcast was accused by U.S. regulators in 2012 of breaching a condition imposed when it bought NBC Universal, by discriminating against rivals in favour of its own channels when placing them on the programme guide.  Comcast says it appealed the decision and the two sides settled in 2014. It also agreed to pay $2.3 million to resolve a federal investigation into allegations it wrongfully charged customers for services they never authorised.  In Britain, Comcast has been involved in some minor breaches of broadcasting rules for airing offensive language, breaking impartiality and advertising rules, and it was sanctioned and fined in 2012 for broadcasting soft porn during the day on a channel that could be watched by children.  Fox has called on regulators to examine all these issues.  But Howard Cartlidge, head of EU and Competition law at DWF, said a larger pattern of offences would need to be proved to force a longer EU investigation: \u201cI don\u2019t see there being significant regulatory hurdles.\u201d  Lawyers do not expect the UK government to launch a public interest test either as Comcast does not own newspapers - the issue that has caused so many delays for Fox.  FOX\u2019S REGULATORY CHALLENGE  The EU cleared Fox\u2019s 2016 bid in a Phase 1 investigation, however British politicians, wary of appearing close to the Murdoch family, have bounced the deal to local regulators.  UK regulators accepted Fox would uphold broadcasting standards, saying that sexual harassment allegations at the Fox News network in the U.S. did not call into question its commitment to standards in Britain.  But media plurality, and whether the deal would reduce competition and give Murdoch too much influence in Britain, has proved more problematic.  The Competition and Markets Authority said in January the deal should be blocked unless a way is found to prevent the Murdochs from influencing the network\u2019s news operations.  Fox has since pledged to keep Sky News independent and fully funded for 10 years. Lawyers and analysts said that should be enough to secure regulatory approval.  Fox sees the fact it has almost received regulatory approval as a competitive advantage over Comcast. It is pursuing the Sky takeover because it is part of its larger deal with Disney.  \u201cWith Disney now being the ultimate buyer for Sky rather than Fox, we think political opposition to the deal may be easing,\u201d UBS said.  TIMEFRAME  After notification, Brussels has 25 working days to analyse Comcast\u2019s deal during Phase 1. Any offer of remedies could add 10 working days.  For Fox, the UK regulator will give its final report to government by May 1 and a final decision will come by mid-June.","47":"(Adds Comcast, Edizione, Sumitomo)  Oct 9 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 2000 GMT on Tuesday:  ** U.S. cable company Comcast took control of Sky after it acquired the 39 percent of the company owned by Twenty-First Century Fox, the rival it defeated with a $40 billion knock-out bid for the European pay-TV group last month.  ** Edizione, the holding company of Italy\u2019s Benetton family, said it had sold 20 percent of an investment vehicle through which it holds 29.9 percent of Spanish tower group Cellnex to a unit of Singapore\u2019s sovereign fund GIC.  ** Japan\u2019s Sumitomo Corp said it had acquired the remaining 35-percent stake it did not already own in Agro Amaz\u00f4nia, a leading agricultural products supplier in Brazil\u2019s No. 1 soy producing state of Mato Grosso.  ** Western Australia state will sell its horse-race betting business and levy a new tax on foreign bookmakers, the state treasurer said.  ** Lactalis, the world\u2019s largest dairy firm, said it had agreed to buy the chilled dairy business of Nestle in Malaysia in a deal worth about $40 million.  ** Poland\u2019s state-run fund PFR has agreed to buy back its mountain cable car operator PKL from private equity fund Mid Europa Partners for an undisclosed sum.  ** Swiss specialty chemicals maker Clariant expects to raise 1 to 2 billion Swiss francs ($2.01 billion) from selling portions of its plastics and coatings business, Chief Executive Hariolf Kottmann said in an interview with the Tages-Anzeiger newspaper.","48":"The Comcast NBC logo is shown on a building in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 13, 2018.

REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  It was a \"great day\" for Comcast CMCSA.O, Chairman and Chief Executive Brian L. Roberts said of Saturday's auction victory. The U.S. group has had its sights set on Sky SKYB.L, Europe's biggest pay-TV company, ever since Walt Disney Co DIS.N beat it to most of Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA.O assets in July.  Some analysts, however, said that Comcast's bid of 17.28 pounds per share in the rare blind auction was driven by an urgent need to build scale to defend against the threat posed by streaming services Netflix NFLX.O and Amazon AMZN.O.  \u201cThe price being paid for Sky is shocking, but it is a clear sign that legacy media companies are desperate for scale in a world dominated by tech platform giants,\u201d said Richard Greenfield, technology and media analyst at research firm BTIG.  Explaining the basis of big media\u2019s rush to merge, Greenfield likened it to the opening scene in the documentary \u201cMarch of the Penguins\u201d.  \u2018WINTER IS COMING\u2019  \u201cThe penguins huddle to survive winter. With Disney\/Fox and Comcast\/Sky, it\u2019s penguins huddling. Winter is still coming,\u201d he said, referring to the advance of tech players such as Amazon.  Sky would reduce Comcast\u2019s reliance on its mature U.S. market by opening the door to Europe, where pay-TV penetration is at about 30 percent and rising.  The deal would also transform Comcast into the world\u2019s largest pay-TV operator with 52 million customers and lift the proportion of its non-U.S. revenue to about 20 percent from about 9 percent, based on 2017 full-year figures.  Comcast is paying a high price - more than double Sky\u2019s share price before Fox made its approach in December 2016. But analysts said that a favorable result in the English Premier League soccer rights auction - Sky\u2019s biggest expense - during the takeover saga had made the business more valuable.  Sky also gives Comcast an immediate beachhead in online video streaming with its Now TV business, which has about 2 million customers.  Analysts see Comcast super-charging Now TV to combat Netflix across the globe. And Sky\u2019s exclusive relationships to distribute HBO entertainment content and Premier League soccer further insulate Comcast over the next few years.  CLOUDS AND SILVER LININGS  Critics of the deal, however, argue that such relationships are sure to come under threat in the longer term, as content producers launch their own services and competition for sports broadcasting rights intensifies as deep-pocketed tech companies join the fray.  On the upside, however, Sky\u2019s product range - including broadband connections that complement its satellite offer in state-of-the-art platforms such as Sky Q - and its brand make it more than a content aggregator, said Alice Enders, head of research at Enders Analysis,  \u201cSky has an extraordinarily well established brand; it is a destination, and that is very valuable in the world of fragmented media,\u201d she said.","52":"* New Fed chair speaks later on Tuesday  * FTSE up 0.13 pct  * Sky soars 22 pct, ITV up 2.5 pct  * Persimmon up 11 pct  By Tom Pfeiffer  LONDON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Comcast\u2019s bid for pay-TV group Sky and strong results from housebuilder Persimmon kept Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 in positive territory on Tuesday, as investors awaited the first public comments from Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve.  Traders will watch closely to see whether Powell continues on the gradual monetary rate path pursued by his predecessor Janet Yellen, or whether he will take a more hawkish approach.  Britain\u2019s top share index was up 0.13 percent at 0943 GMT, with Sky soaring 20 percent as investors priced in a possible bidding war for the company following Comcast\u2019s surprise move. Rival broadcaster ITV rose 2.5 percent.  The offer from the $184 billion U.S. media giant could scupper the plans of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox to buy out Sky and sell it to Walt Disney  That takeover has already been delayed by concerns for media plurality in Britain and whether Murdoch would be a \u201cfit and proper\u201d owner of such an important broadcaster.  \u201cRemember there is a $1.5 billion break Fox have to pay if the Fox\/Disney deal breaks,\u201d said from Neil Campling, Co-Head of the Global Thematic Group at Mirabaud Securities.  \u201cThere is no way we can see that Fox will walk away given how advanced the regulatory clearance process is. This bid marks a floor not an end to this particular saga. Let the battle commence.\u201d  Not everyone agreed, with Liberum analysts doubting Fox or Disney would get into a bidding war.  Investec said Disney may decide it has \u201cenough to do in the U.S. versus a contested European bid process.  Standard Chartered rose 1.7 percent after it joined rival UK banks in resuming dividend payments as profits soared, though weaker than expected revenue kept investor exuberance in check.  Housebuilders rose across the board after Persimmon announced a more than doubling of dividend payments, a 25 percent jump in profits and a 7 percent increase in reservation rates.  Concerns over a downturn in the housing market have weighed on the industry in recent months, with a decline in mortgage approvals and the Bank of England raising benchmark interest rates.  Persimmon was forced to scale back its management bonus plan this week after widespread criticism that it could have netted bosses more than 200 million pounds from share options.  The cash return plan unveiled on Tuesday would make Persimmon the second-highest yielding housebuilding stock, said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.  \u201cPersimmon has gone a long way to calming at least one unhappy party by showering investors in the stock with a cash windfall of their own,\u201d said Mould.  Persimmon jumped 11 percent, Berkeley rose 2.3 percent, Taylor Wimpey 1.8 percent and Barratt Developments 1.4 percent.  Troubled subprime lender Provident Financial saw its shares surge 87 percent to their highest in six months after the company said it would raise 331 million pounds via a rights issue.  Three traders said the smaller-than-expected cash call had set off a short-squeeze as hedge funds attempt to cover their positions. The stock is the most shorted of any UK company.","53":"The NBC and Comcast logo are displayed on top of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, formerly known as the GE building, in midtown Manhattan in New York July 1, 2015. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts is swallowing his ego a second time. The controlling owner of the U.S. cable firm decided not to top rival Walt Disney\u2019s $71 billion bid for some assets of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Twenty-First Century Fox. He also backed down from an aggressive tilt at the Mouse House 14 years earlier. Given the eye-watering price Disney is paying, Roberts and his shareholders should come out the winners.  Instead, Comcast will focus across the Atlantic and attempt to win a bidding fight with Fox for pay-TV outfit Sky, for which Roberts has so far bid around $34 billion.  Disney CEO Bob Iger initially agreed in December to pay Fox shareholders $52.4 billion in stock for the media assets on offer. Comcast came back in June with a $65 billion all-cash bid just as the U.S. Department of Justice lost its case against AT&T\u2019s merger with Time Warner. Disney countered with the current price, and Fox shareholders are due to vote on the transaction next week.  In short, Roberts has forced Iger to pay more than 35 percent over his original offer and pushed the leverage-shy Disney boss into new territory: Breakingviews calculates that after the deal closes, Disney\u2019s debt will rise to more than three times EBITDA even if Fox doesn\u2019t first buy the 61 percent of Sky it doesn\u2019t own.  Aside from the balance sheet, Iger must also successfully integrate the sometimes rough-edged Fox properties with Disney\u2019s pristine and family-friendly brand. Iger has succeeded with prior acquisitions Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm, but Fox is on a larger scale and the deal comes at much more perilous time for traditional media firms under assault from the likes of Netflix.  Roberts\u2019 hostile lunge at Disney in 2004, aiming to capitalize on his target\u2019s weakness at the time, met resistance and shareholder doubt. He was smart to walk away. Since the start of 2008, Comcast\u2019s annual total return to shareholders has been a notch or two higher than Disney\u2019s. Roberts yet could undo some of the good if the bidding for Sky \u2013 already pricey \u2013 goes higher. For now, he can claim his second loss to Disney as victory.","54":"May 8 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp:  * ADOPTION OF POST-OFFER UNDERTAKINGS AND COMCAST COMMITMENTS BY WAY OF DEED POLL  * FULL TERMS OF CERTAIN LEGALLY BINDING POST-OFFER UNDERTAKINGS AGREED WITH PANEL AND ARE CONDITIONAL ON OCCURRENCE OF EFFECTIVE DATE  * ALSO INTENDING TO GIVE CERTAIN LEGALLY BINDING COMMITMENTS BY WAY OF DEED POLL  * THROUGHOUT PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS FROM EFFECTIVE DATE, COMCAST UNDERTAKES TO PROCURE, AND SKY UNDERTAKES, SKY SHALL MAINTAIN UK HQ IN OSTERLEY  * COMCAST AND SKY UNDERTAKES TO PROCURE, NO LATER THAN THREE MONTHS AFTER EFFECTIVE DATE, SKY SHALL ESTABLISH \u201cEDITORIAL BOARD\u201d FOR SKY NEWS  * CONFIRMS WILLINGNESS TO PROVIDE FOR RELEVANT REGULATOR TO BE A BENEFICIARY OF SKY NEWS BINDING COMMITMENTS IN SAME WAY AS SKY NEWS BOARD Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","55":"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday turned away an appeal by Comcast Corp of a ruling that temporarily forced the cable company to remove a feature from its Xfinity X1 entertainment system because it infringed Tivo Corp patents.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/  (Reuters) - Comcast Corp on Monday launched new advertising capabilities to help advertisers find and target certain television viewers, as the largest U.S. cable TV provider tries to lure ad dollars away from digital rivals.  The TV industry has been trying to catch up to digital and internet advertising, where technology has long allowed companies to target ads to people based on interests, and more easily measure how effective the ads were in convincing consumers to visit stores or buy a product.  Comcast will rename its cable ad sales division Effectv. The name was chosen because \u201cWe\u2019re reinforcing that TV is effective, and not just an awareness play,\u201d said Maria Weaver, chief marketing officer at Comcast Advertising in an interview.  Comcast said Monday it will use its proprietary data along with other data to help advertisers learn what their target audience is watching on TV, which will help them purchase commercials in the right places to reach certain viewers.  Previously, advertisers largely had to figure out what audiences were watching, \u201cbut it was always a guess and almost always wrong,\u201d said Marcien Jenckes, president of Comcast Advertising, in an interview.  The company will allow advertisers to use up to five different versions of a commercial and show them to different types of viewers.  For example, a car manufacturer can purchase a commercial spot through Effectv to be played on a cable network. Comcast could then show different versions advertising a mini-van, sports car or pickup truck to households that are in the market for those cars.  The new ad capabilities are part of a larger trend in which the TV industry is going from \u201cselling and delivering spots to selling and delivering audiences,\u201d Jenckes said.  Like other cable and satellite TV providers, Comcast is losing subscribers as viewers \u201ccut the cord\u201d and switch to streaming video, underscoring the need to convince advertisers it can keep up with digital platforms like Google\u2019s YouTube.

Under British takeover rules, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox now has until Sept. 22 to trump Comcast\u2019s 14.75 pound per share offer for Sky, which values the broadcaster 25.9 billion pounds ($33 billion), after it formalized its own 14 pounds per share bid.  Comcast gatecrashed Fox\u2019s attempt to buy the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own earlier this year and the U.S. cable giant\u2019s latest, higher offer, which it submitted in July, has been recommended to shareholders by the broadcaster\u2019s independent directors.  Fox posted its formal offer document, without improving its price, on Tuesday, setting in motion a timetable to end the uncertainty over Sky\u2019s future by triggering a 46-day period during which both Fox and Comcast can lift their offers.  If the situation is not resolved by then, Britain\u2019s Takeover Panel can run an auction to bring the complex and long-winded transatlantic takeover battle for Sky to an end.  However, Fox may opt to walk away from the Sky deal rather than taking on Comcast, people familiar with the matter said.  Sky shares were up 1 percent at 15.355 pounds on Wednesday, signaling that investors expect the bidding war to continue.  FILE PHOTO: The 21st Century Fox logo is displayed on the side of a building in midtown Manhattan in New York, U.S., February 27, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  In the document, Fox said it was switching from a scheme of arrangement to an offer. That means it can choose to lower its acceptance threshold from 75 percent of Sky\u2019s minority shareholders to a simple majority of all the broadcaster\u2019s shares, including its own 39 percent stake.  \u201cFlipping to an offer affords Fox more flexibility should they wish to come back with a higher number,\u201d analysts at Olivetree Financial said. \u201cA scheme is cumbersome as you would constantly need to co-ordinate your actions and intentions with the Sky board.\u201d  ADVISER PAY  Fox also said it expects to pay its advisers, which include Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Centerview Partners, about 242 million pounds if its Sky bid succeeds.  Since submitting its first 10.75 pound per share bid for Sky in December 2016, Fox has agreed to sell the bulk of its TV and film assets, including its Sky stake, to Walt Disney DIS.N.  Comcast had been vying with Disney for the Fox assets but last month dropped its pursuit to focus on buying Sky.  In a separate announcement, Sky acknowledged Fox\u2019s offer document and said its independent committee would respond to the offer within 14 days.  The Takeover Panel, which regulates merger and acquisitions in Britain, ruled earlier this year that Disney would have to make an offer for the rest of Sky if its deal for the Fox assets completes before either Comcast or Fox acquire the UK broadcaster.  The regulator said last month that the level of any mandatory Disney offer should be 14 pounds a share, the same price as Fox\u2019s current offer.  But the Takeover Appeal Board, an independent body, said on Wednesday that \u201cseveral interested parties\u201d had lodged appeals against the ruling and that it would meet to consider their petitions.","62":"March 5 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp:  * COMCAST - LAUNCHING NEW INTERNET SERVICE FOR SPEEDS UP TO 1 GB-PER-SECOND TO RESIDENTIAL & BUSINESS CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT GREATER HOUSTON AREA Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","63":"Construction of a $50 million esports arena in Philadelphia has been put on hold because of the coronavirus pandemic.

A sale of Sky News to Disney or another third party would be enough to allay concerns over the 87-year-old media mogul\u2019s influence, Britain said on Tuesday.  Murdoch\u2019s Twenty-First Century Fox launched a 10.75 pound-a-share bid to buy all of Sky in December 2016, but the takeover has been held up by politicians and regulators who fear it will give him too much sway when combined with his newspaper interests.  Comcast took advantage of the delay to make its own move on Sky, with a 12.50 pounds-a-share bid in April trumping the long-standing Fox offer.  Shares in Sky rose 0.3 percent to 13.54 pounds, indicating that investors think the drama has a long way to run.  Analysts at Credit Suisse said that with Fox having pursued Sky for 16 months through a long regulatory process, they would expect it to make an increased bid for Sky in excess of the Comcast bid.  \u201cIn our view the Sky share price is already anticipating such an outcome with the shares closing on June 4 at 13.50 pounds, 8 percent ahead of the Comcast bid,\u201d they said.  Even if Fox beats Comcast, Murdoch\u2019s control of the whole group is unlikely to last long because he has agreed to sell many of his TV and film assets, including Sky, to Walt Disney Co in a separate $52 billion deal.  Culture Secretary Matt Hancock said Fox\u2019s final proposal made to divest Sky News to Disney, or to an alternative suitable buyer, with funding secured for at least 10 years, was likely to be the best remedy for the public interest concerns that had been identified.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  But he said he needed to be sure that Sky News remained financially viable over the long term, was able to operate as a major UK-based news provider and was able to take its editorial decisions independently.  The extra commitments will be the subject of consultation in the next 15 days with a view to agreeing an acceptable remedy, he said.  \u201cI am optimistic that we can achieve this goal, not least given the willingness 21st Century Fox has shown in developing these credible proposals,\u201d he told lawmakers.  Disney said it welcomed the announcement and was ready for any discussions requested by the UK secretary.  COMCAST CLEARED  Comcast announced its firm offer for Sky in April, resulting in Sky\u2019s independent board members withdrawing their recommendation of the offer from Fox, which already owns 39 percent of Sky.  Hancock confirmed on Tuesday that he would not intervene in regards to Comcast, either on the grounds of broadcasting standards or on media plurality.  Sky was formed in 1990 when Murdoch merged his fledgling British satellite TV service with a rival.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  The company is chaired by Murdoch\u2019s son James, who played a key role in building the company into a major European broadcaster with operations in Germany, Austria and Italy as well as Britain.  Its customer base now numbers nearly 23 million homes, a major prize for media groups that want to scale up against online groups Netflix and Amazon.  The already complex deal permutations around Sky became even more complicated last month when Comcast said it was preparing a higher, all-cash offer for all of the assets Fox had agreed to sell to Disney.  Fox welcomed Hancock\u2019s announcement, and noted that it had already proposed divesting the platform\u2019s 24-hour news channel to Disney regardless of the fate of its bid for the wider Fox assets.  \u201cWe now look forward to engaging with DCMS (Department of Culture, Media and Sport) and we are confident that we will reach a final decision clearing our transaction,\u201d Fox said in a statement.  Sky noted the decision regarding both Fox and Comcast, and said its independent directors were mindful of their fiduciary duties and remained focused on maximising value for Sky shareholders.  Hancock\u2019s decision came after an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) into whether controlling Sky would give Murdoch, who also owns the Times and Sun newspapers, too much influence on Britain\u2019s news media.","65":"(Reuters) - Shares of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc rose as much as 3.4 percent on Tuesday after Reuters reported that cable operator Comcast Corp was preparing an all-cash bid to rival a deal agreed late last year with Walt Disney Co.

Disney in December had offered to buy film, television and international businesses from Fox for $52.4 billion in stock to beef up its offering against streaming rivals Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc.  A handful of notes from Wall Street analysts said Comcast\u2019s involvement was likely to push Disney to raise its existing offer.  Disney shares fell 1 percent in morning trade in New York, while Comcast\u2019s dipped 3.5 percent to $31.25.  \u201cIt is reasonable to expect Disney to counter any potential offer while also changing the composition of its current all-stock offer,\u201d Jefferies analyst Scott Goldman said.  \u201cComcast and Disney are likely to view this as the last remaining transformational deal in media.\u201d  He also pointed to the huge increase in Comcast\u2019s debt the acquisition of both Fox and British pay-TV group Sky for almost $100 billion in total would generate.  \u201cInvestors have considered such a move ever since Comcast  inserted itself in the race for control of Sky,\u201d Jefferies\u2019 Goldman said.  \u201cHowever, investors likely have not contemplated an all-cash bid, which would take pro forma leverage to around 4.5 times,  including synergies, intensifying the balance sheet debate.\u201d  Comcast stepped up its push to buy UK-based Sky on Tuesday, keen to prove that it will face fewer regulatory hurdles in its $31 billion pursuit of Sky compared to Fox.

AGCOM said in a statement it had launched a similar probe into SKY Italia\u2019s telecoms and media assets. SKY, part of Comcast, is a major player in Italy\u2019s pay-TV market and has recently launched its own broadband services.  Both inquiries would last four months, the regulator said.  Vivendi declined to comment. SKY did not respond to a request for a comment.  AGCOM\u2019s inquiry could help Mediaset, controlled by the family of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, in its battle against Vivendi as the French group tries to recover its voting rights for its full stake in the broadcaster.  The two groups have been at loggerheads since 2016 when Vivendi ditched an accord to buy Mediaset\u2019s pay-TV unit and built its 29% stake, which Mediaset considers hostile.  Vivendi was forced to transfer two thirds of its voting rights in Mediaset into a trust after Italy\u2019s communications watchdog ruled in 2017 that it had broken media plurality rules.  The trust has been prevented from voting at Mediaset\u2019s shareholder meetings.  In September, however, the European Union\u2019s top court ruled the Italian law in question violated EU rules.  That prompted Rome to approve stop-gap legislation which requires AGCOM to hold an inquiry into whether Vivendi\u2019s positions in Italy\u2019s telecoms and media sectors are harmful for media plurality by looking at total revenues, entry barriers and the level of competition in those sectors.  The probe could delay an administrative court decision on Vivendi\u2019s request to scrap restrictions on its Mediaset holding, legal sources have said. A hearing on the case is set for Dec. 16.  On Friday, Vivendi lodged a complaint with the European Commission against the stop-gap law, saying it was aimed at circumventing September\u2019s EU court decision.","67":"April 30 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp on Thursday reported its best quarter of broadband net additions in 12 years, but revenue fell shy of Wall Street\u2019s estimate as the coronavirus pandemic hurt advertising.  In the first quarter, Comcast gained 477,000 broadband subscribers, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of 364,000 net additions, according to research firm FactSet. Revenue from the business grew 9.3% to $5 billion.  Comcast experienced a spike in broadband use and a shift in usage patterns as schools and offices closed because of the coronavirus outbreak. The company has said its network has had enough capacity to manage those changes.  Video losses in the first quarter were steeper than expected as the trend toward \u201ccord-cutting\u201d continues. Comcast lost 409,000 video customers, more than the 261,000 loss estimated by FactSet and more than the 149,000 video customers it lost in the fourth quarter.  The company has been focused on attracting high-margin broadband customers to offset cord-cutting, as viewers who stream TV and film require a broadband connection to do so.  Comcast reported first-quarter revenue of $26.61 billion, missing the Wall Street consensus estimate of $26.75 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  British pay-TV group Sky, which had early exposure to the coronavirus in Europe, generated first-quarter revenue of $4.52 billion, missing the average estimate of $4.81 billion.  For the first quarter, Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal segment, which includes NBC Entertainment and Universal Pictures, reported revenue of $7.73 billion, down 7% from a year earlier. Revenue at the filmed entertainment unit fell 22.5% from the same quarter a year earlier; revenue at theme parks, which like movie theaters were shuttered for part of the quarter due to the coronavirus, fell 31.9%.

That case likely will be guided by the outcome in Comcast\u2019s appeal.  Comcast and Charter have said their business decisions were based on capacity constraints, not race, and that Allen\u2019s channels, including JusticeCentral.TV, Cars.TV, Pets.TV and Comedy.TV, did not show sufficient promise or customer demand to merit distribution. Other television distributors, including Verizon, AT&T and DirecTV, carry some of Allen\u2019s programming, court papers said.  \u201cComcast has an outstanding record of supporting and fostering diverse programming, including programming from African-American owned channels, two more of which we launched earlier this year,\u201d the company said in a statement, adding that it hopes the Supreme Court will bring the case to an end.  Allen disputed the statement, saying the channels Comcast mentioned are not wholly owned by African Americans. Comcast, Allen said, \u201cwill continue to lose this case, and the American people who stand against racial discrimination will win.\u201d  Entertainment Studios Networks sued in Los Angeles federal court, accusing the cable companies of violating the Civil Rights Act of 1866, a post-Civil War law that forbids racial discrimination in business contracts.  The suits brought by Allen pinned the rejections primarily on racial discrimination, accusing cable executives of giving insincere or invalid excuses and granting contracts to carry white-owned networks during the same period.  The lawsuits also alleged that the companies\u2019 commitments to diversity are a sham and that they have used outside civil rights groups, such as Reverend Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network, to provide cover for empty promises. Comcast called those accusations \u201coutlandish.\u201d  Both Comcast and Charter called the lawsuits a \u201cscam\u201d and sought to have the cases dismissed. But the 9th Circuit last year allowed the litigation to proceed.  At the heart of the case is the question of whether individuals who are refused a business contract can sue under the civil rights law without ruling out reasons other than discrimination for the denial. The 9th Circuit said lawsuits can proceed to trial if plaintiffs can show that discriminatory intent was one factor among others in the denial of a contract.","70":"(Reuters) - U.S. cable operator Comcast Corp is asking investment banks to increase a bridge financing facility by as much as $60 billion so it can make an all-cash offer for the media assets that Twenty-First Century Fox Inc has agreed to sell to Walt Disney Co for $52 billion, three people familiar with the matter said on Monday.  Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts only plans to proceed with the bid if a federal judge allows AT&T Inc\u2019s planned $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc to proceed, the sources said. The U.S. Department of Justice has opposed the AT&T-Time Warner deal over antitrust concerns, and a decision from U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon is expected in June.  Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger clinched an all-stock deal with Fox Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch in December to acquire Fox\u2019s film, television and international businesses, giving the world\u2019s largest entertainment company an arsenal of shows and movies to combat growing digital rivals Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc.  Comcast, owner of NBC and Universal Pictures, has also made a 22 billion pound ($30 billion) offer to acquire the 61 percent stake in European pay-TV group Sky Plc that Fox does not already own. In doing so, it topped an earlier offer for the entirety of Sky by Fox.  Last November, Comcast offered to acquire most of Fox\u2019s assets in an all-stock deal valued at $34.41 per share, or $64 billion, a regulatory filing showed last month. Like Disney, Comcast sought to buy Fox\u2019s entertainment networks, movie studios, television production and international assets, the filing shows.  Fox ended up announcing an all-stock deal with Disney for $29.54 per share. In the regulatory filing, Disney and Fox cited regulatory hurdles as reasons to reject Comcast\u2019s bid, even though they did not reference it by name.  The exact value of Comcast\u2019s new bid for the Fox assets is not yet clear, although the $60 billion in new financing indicates it is seeking significant firepower to outbid Disney. Comcast already has a $30 billion bridge loan to finance its Sky offer.  The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Comcast, Fox and Disney declined to comment.  Fox shares rose 5.13 percent to $39.99 on the news in after-hours trading in New York on Monday. Comcast shares were down 1.5 percent to $31.90, while Disney shares were down 0.5 percent to $102.00.  Murdoch, who owns close to a 17 percent stake in Fox and holds about 40 percent of the voting power, prefers to be paid in stock rather than cash for the Fox assets, because this makes the transaction non-taxable for shareholders, sources have said. It is not clear how receptive he would be to an all-cash offer.  Last month\u2019s regulatory filing also showed that Fox viewed Disney\u2019s stock as more valuable than Comcast\u2019s, based on historic prices, and felt that a deal between Disney and Fox would generate greater long-term value. The Roberts family controls Comcast through a dual-class stock structure.  Comcast\u2019s stock has dropped since then, from around $38 to about $32 now, giving the company a market capitalization of $149 billion.  Disney has committed to share buybacks as a way of returning cash to Fox shareholders. As a result, Comcast sees an opening in being disruptive to the deal by making an all-cash bid, according to the sources.

Fox's bid for Sky has been complicated by its more recent agreement to sell many of its TV and film assets to Walt Disney Co DIS.N, including its stake in Sky, for $52 billion.  Fox said it had offered a range of undertakings that would fund and protect the editorial independence of Sky News. It said this underscored its \u201clong-standing commitment to the excellence and complete editorial independence of the news service we created 28 years ago.  \u201cThese enhanced remedies go above and beyond what Ofcom, the expert independent regulator on UK broadcasting, had stated would mitigate concerns around media plurality.

He said however that having given his verdict, he would consider any further undertakings that may be made by Fox and offer the industry the chance to give their verdict.

The U.S. cable giant bid 17.28 pounds a share for control of London-listed Sky, bettering a 15.67 pounds-a-share offer by Fox, Britain\u2019s Takeover Panel said.  Buying Sky will make Philadelphia-based Comcast, which owns the NBC network and Universal Pictures, the world\u2019s largest pay-TV operator with around 52 million customers.  Chairman and chief executive Brian Roberts has had his eye on Sky as a way to help counter declines in subscribers for traditional cable TV in its core U.S. market as viewers switch to video-on-demand services like Netflix NFLX.O and Amazon AMZN.O.  \u201cThis is a great day for Comcast,\u201d he said. \u201cThis acquisition will allow us to quickly, efficiently and meaningfully increase our customer base and expand internationally.\u201d  Comcast's knock-out offer thwarted Murdoch's long-held ambition to win control of Sky, and is also a setback for U.S. entertainment giant Walt Disney DIS.N which would have likely been its ultimate owner.  Disney has agreed a separate $71 billion deal to buy most of Fox\u2019s film and TV assets, including its existing 39 percent stake in Sky, and would have taken full ownership after a successful Fox takeover.  Comcast\u2019s final offer was a jump on its bid going into the auction of 14.75 pounds, and compares with Sky\u2019s closing price of 15.85 pounds on Friday.  Comcast believed it needed to deliver a knock-out blow given that Fox\u2019s existing stake in Sky gave it a chance of victory if it was a close second to Comcast, two sources said.  Its final offer - more than double Sky\u2019s share price before Fox made its approach in December 2016 - quickly won the backing of Sky\u2019s independent directors on Saturday.  \u201cWe are recommending it as it represents materially superior value,\u201d said Martin Gilbert, chairman of Sky\u2019s independent committee. \u201cWe are focused on drawing this process to a successful and swift close and therefore urge shareholders to accept the recommended Comcast offer.\u201d  Fox noted the recommendation, saying it was considering options for its 39 percent stake and would make another announcement in due course.  \u201cSky is a remarkable story and we are proud to have played such a significant role in building the incredible value reflected today in Comcast\u2019s offer,\u201d Fox said.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Fox\u2019s holding, which Comcast\u2019s offer values at more than $15 billion, stems from Murdoch\u2019s role in the creation of the company nearly three decades ago.  His younger son James was pivotal in building Sky into Europe\u2019s leading pay-TV operator as its former chief executive and current chairman.  Comcast, which requires 50 percent plus one share of Sky\u2019s equity to win control, said it was also seeking to buy Sky shares in the market.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  HUGE PRICE  One fund manager who holds Sky shares said nobody could complain about the Comcast price.  \u201cThe question now is if Fox actually sells out and if not can Comcast get to 50 percent,\u201d he said.  One banker involved in the auction said: \u201cDid Comcast pay a lot more than they needed to?\u201d  Sources familiar with the matter said Fox, Disney and Comcast had not been in discussions about the 39 percent stake.  The auction was a dramatic climax to a transatlantic bidding battle waged since February, when Comcast gate-crashed Fox\u2019s takeover of Sky.  It is a blow to 87-year-old Murdoch, who tried to buy Sky eight years ago only for the bid to collapse in the fallout from a phone-hacking scandal at his British newspaper business.  Some politicians have opposed a deal, citing concerns about the influence Murdoch would wield over the UK\u2019s news agenda.  Fox made a string of concessions to assuage those worries and land a company that serves 23 million households in Britain, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy.  Sky\u2019s chief executive Jeremy Darroch said Comcast\u2019s victory was the beginning of a new chapter. \u201cSky has never stood still, and with Comcast our momentum will only increase,\u201d he said.

Chief Executive Roberts said the visit was one of a number of things that confirmed Sky as a \u201cjewel\u201d that his company should try to acquire, as Comcast looks to boost international revenues as growth in the United States slows.  The biggest cable operator in the United States offered on Tuesday to pay $31 billion to buy Sky, challenging Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox and Bob Iger\u2019s Walt Disney for the European pay-TV group.  Roberts said he had closely tracked what Sky had been doing for years, but last November, he had an unexpected reminder of Sky\u2019s influence as European\u2019s biggest pay-TV provider while in a cab with a colleague.  \u201cI suggested that we jump in a taxi and go to one of the malls and get a demo of Sky in one of their shops. And we had a fabulous experience,\u201d Roberts told reporters on a call.  \u201cThe cab driver was incredibly knowledgeable about the difference between Virgin and Sky in every feature. We were learning a lot there. Then when we went to the Sky store, we spent at least an hour going through every feature and comparing it to our own... We were really terribly impressed.\u201d  Liberty Global-owned Virgin Media is a British rival to Sky.  Roberts said that while the experience wasn\u2019t the deciding factor in moving forward with the bid, it reiterated the media group\u2019s value to the chief executive.  \u201cIt was another reminder for me how impressive Sky is, and how lucky we would be at Comcast to be able to combine together.\u201d  Another element in Comcast\u2019s thinking was Sky\u2019s success earlier this month in winning the rights to show Premier League soccer matches for a fee well below analyst expectations, boosting its future earnings and lifting its shares.  The offer is a huge statement of intent from the mild-mannered media mogul Roberts, 58, who took over as head of the cable and entertainment conglomerate from his father, Ralph, who founded the company in 1963.  The younger Roberts became Comcast\u2019s president in 1990 and CEO in 2002, having spent his whole career at the company.  He told reporters that he had taken a \u201ckeen interest\u201d in Sky for many years. He said Sky\u2019s chief executive Jeremy Darroch had shown him an early preview of the Sky Q TV platform box, and that several people had worked as executives for both Comcast and Sky.  While Fox\u2019s 39 percent stake in Sky and the agreed takeover by Murdoch has produced complications around the company, it also presented the opportunity to bid, and Roberts said that his London visit was a reminder of Sky\u2019s fundamental value.  \u201cFrankly there\u2019s nothing as great in the United States,\u201d he said.  \u201cSeeing it again, and listening to the passion of the sales and looking at the product... all those things combined to reinforce what a number of us have known for years - that this is a jewel.\u201d","79":"FILE PHOTO: The Twenty-First Century Fox Studios flag flies over the company building in Los Angeles, California U.S. on November 6, 2017.

Comcast\u2019s deliberations indicate that it believes it still has a chance to clinch a deal with Fox, even though it previous bid last year for more than $60 billion was rejected over concerns that regulators worried about media consolidation could thwart it, the sources said.  Comcast may decide not to make any new offer, the sources said. Its decision will be informed by how Fox justifies the deal with Disney in a regulatory filing to its shareholders sometime before they are asked to vote on the deal this summer, the sources added.  The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Comcast, Disney and Fox gave no immediate comment.  Comcast might be prepared to offer protections to Fox such as agreeing to remove certain assets from the deal that prove controversial in Washington, D.C., including regional sports channels, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported on Comcast\u2019s deliberations.  It was is possible that instead of re-engaging in pursuit of all of Fox assets, Comcast could zero in on something in particular, such as European pay TV giant Sky, the Wall Street Journal report said, citing anonymous sources.  The Murdoch family, which controls Fox, preferred a deal with Disney because it would rather be paid in Disney than Comcast stock, and expects a potential deal with Disney to be cleared by U.S. antitrust regulators more easily, sources told Reuters in December.  Disney struck a deal with Fox to buy film, television and international businesses. The deal is set to bring to a close more than half a century of expansion by Murdoch, 86, who turned a single Australian newspaper he inherited from his father at the age of 21 into one of the world\u2019s most important global news and film conglomerates.

Fox, which has been trying to buy the pan-European group since December 2016, has offered to pay 14 pounds per share, a 12 percent premium to Comcast\u2019s offer, but below the 14.80 pounds Sky shares were trading at on Wednesday.  Analysts said the bid threw down the gauntlet for Comcast, the world\u2019s biggest entertainment company, to return with a higher offer. The U.S. cable group gatecrashed Fox\u2019s bid for Sky in February, forcing the independent directors to drop their original recommendation for Fox\u2019s offer.  Murdoch already owns 39 percent of the group.  \u201cIt\u2019s good for shareholders and will probably be followed by another Comcast offer,\u201d consultant Claire Enders said.  The fight for Britain\u2019s leading pay-TV group is part of a bigger battle being waged in the global entertainment industry as the world\u2019s biggest media giants offer tens of billions of dollars in deals to be able to compete with Netflix and Amazon.  Comcast and Walt Disney are locked in a separate $70 billion-plus battle to buy most of Fox\u2019s assets, which would include Sky.  Present in 23 million homes across Europe, Sky has become a prized asset due to the programmes it creates and the direct relationship it has with customers.  \u201cThis transformative transaction will position Sky so that it can continue to compete within an environment that now includes some of the largest companies in the world,\u201d Fox said.  PRIME TIME DRAMA  Fox\u2019s new offer represents an 82 percent premium to where Sky\u2019s shares were trading in December 2016 before Fox agreed its original deal, and a multiple of 21 times 2017 earnings per share.  However British regulators have indicated that if Disney succeeds in buying Fox, including the 39 percent stake in Sky, it would be required to offer the same price for the remainder of Sky. According to some shareholders, that has set an implied higher floor for Sky\u2019s shares.  Hedge funds including Elliott have bought into Sky in recent months and other vocal shareholders such as Crispin Odey have demanded that the independent directors secure a better deal.  \u201cThere are enough sub-plots in the race to acquire Sky to commission a prime-time drama,\u201d said George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.  \u201cFox coming back in for Sky isn\u2019t a surprise in itself, but the fact the offer is slightly behind what some had anticipated brings another twist. In fact, there\u2019s every chance it might entice another counter from Comcast.\u201d  Murdoch\u2019s Fox said the performance of Sky since December 2016, including the renewal of the right to show English Premier League matches at a lower price than expected, justified its higher offer.  The British government is expected to allow Fox to buy Sky this week, after the U.S. group agreed to sell Sky\u2019s award-winning news channel to Disney to prevent Murdoch from owning too much of the British media.  Fox, run by Rupert\u2019s son James who is also the chairman of Sky, has made a string of guarantees to help secure backing for its deal, including investment in British TV production, technology and the protection for Sky News.

The initiative, called \u201cOn Addressability,\u201d aims to create standards for addressable advertising, which targets ads to certain households based on their interests. It has so far been done only on a small scale in TV advertising.  Comcast said it will partner with two other cable providers, Charter Communications and Cox Media, the ad division of Cox Communications, to pool what they have learned from offering addressable advertising, help other content distributors do the same, including how to ensure customer data is used in ways that comply with privacy standards.  While TV is still the best way to reach large numbers of people at one time, it has lacked the targeting, data and measurement that digital platforms like Facebook offer advertisers, said Marcien Jenckes, president of advertising for Comcast Cable.  \u201cTV is often looked at as the lowest common denominator medium (in advertising), and unless addressability is achieved at scale, we\u2019re going to fall short,\u201d he said in an interview.  Comcast has worked with TV networks Fox, Viacom and A+E in the past to develop addressable advertising, Jenckes said. He declined to name current programmers the company will work with.  U.S. wireless carrier AT&T Inc and its advertising unit Xandr have also heavily publicized their efforts in addressable ads. Xandr and Comcast-owned advertising technology company FreeWheel are both part of Project OAR, a consortium of companies that is trying to standardize addressable advertising.  Comcast is open to working with Xandr for the On Addressability initiative, but \u201cour understanding is they want to take a more solo approach,\u201d Jenckes said.  A Xandr spokesman declined to comment.  The addressable TV advertising market is expected to hit $3.3 billion by 2020, up from $2 billion in 2018, according to research firm eMarketer. Addressable is still only 3.7% of total TV ad spending.

Peacock Premium will launch nationwide on July 15 for everyone for $5 a month but continue to be free for Comcast X1 and Flex customers.  A free version of Peacock with 7,500 hours of content, and an ad-free tier that costs $10 per month will also launch on July 15.

Financial details were not disclosed.  Studios have been pushing to make their movies available in living rooms sooner than the typical timeline of roughly 90 days after they debut in cinemas. Theaters have long resisted that idea, and the standoff had prompted AMC to say earlier this year it would no longer show Universal films in its theaters.  On Tuesday, AMC said it supported the agreement to offer films in homes after just 17 days.  \u201cAMC enthusiastically embraces this new industry model both because we are participating in the entirety of the economics of the new structure, and because premium video-on-demand creates the added potential for increased movie studio profitability, which should in turn lead to the green-lighting of more theatrical movies,\u201d AMC\u2019s chief executive, Adam Aron, said in a statement.

REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  NEW YORK (Reuters) - T-Mobile said on Wednesday it has launched a call protection feature with Comcast Corp to help protect customers from answering robocalls and spams, as robocalls have swollen into a tide numbering in the millions every day.  Robocalls, automated telephone calls that deliver a recorded message, typically on behalf of a political party or telemarketing company, are on the rise. T-Mobile said its new feature identifies authentic calls across the networks with the sign \u201cCaller Verified\u201d appearing on phone screens.  The feature will be available to T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile customers on certain smartphone devices by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and LG Electronics Inc, the mobile carrier said, adding that it is working with other phone makers like Apple Inc to launch the feature in the near future.  Last month, 5.2 billion robocalls were placed, an average of 168.8 million per day, according to YouMail, a robocall management company that tracks the volume of calls. Scams make up about 40 percent of all robocalls.  T-Mobile said its new feature will be available for Comcast Xfinity Voice home phone service customers later in the year.  The feature uses an industry standard, called \u201cSecure Telephony Identity Revisited (STIR) and Secure Handling of Asserted information using toKENs (SHAKEN),\u201d or STIR\/SHAKEN, to identify authentic calls across the networks. In February, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai told major telecommunications providers that the agency would step in if they failed to implement the standard to fight robocalls this year.  \u201cRobocalls and spam calls are an industry-wide problem, and we\u2019ve got to join forces to keep consumers protected. Today, we\u2019re the first to cross industry lines to do just that,\u201d said John Legere, chief executive of T-Mobile.  While T-Mobile claims to be the first to implement the feature across two networks, AT&T in March announced that it had successfully tested what the company believes to be the first STIR\/SHAKEN-authenticated call between two different telecom networks with Comcast.","87":"FILE PHOTO: A branded employee shuttle bus is seen at Sky TV's west London headquarters, July 11, 2011.

REUTERS\/Andrew Winning\/File Photo  LONDON (Reuters) - Two hedge funds that have criticised Twenty-First Century Fox's FOXA.O takeover of Britain's Sky SKYB.L have said Comcast Corp's CMCSA.O rival $31 billion offer for the broadcaster is likely to trigger a higher counter-bid for the company. Comcast on Tuesday offered 12.50 pounds-a-share for the pay-television operator, seeking to disrupt a deal struck in December 2016 by Rupert Murdoch's Fox FOXA.O to acquire the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own for 10.75 pounds-a-share.  The situation is further complicated by a $52 billion (37.26 billion pounds) deal agreed in December 2017 by Walt Disney Co to buy Fox assets, including its 39 percent Sky stake. Disney has previously said it expects the sale of Sky to Fox to complete before it acquires the Fox assets, meaning it would assume full ownership of the British company. Hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, who has long argued that Fox\u2019s takeover proposal is too cheap, told Reuters the bid from Comcast, the biggest U.S. cable operator, was \u201cfantastic\u201d and that a counter offer was now likely.Disney could bid directly for the British pay-TV company instead of Fox, which has faced regulatory obstacles to its Sky offer, said Odey, who is a former son-in-law of Murdoch.\u201dOnce you\u2019re in a bidding war, it\u2019s not about fair value, it\u2019s about what do you think it\u2019s worth,\u201d Odey added. His firm owns almost 1 percent of Sky, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Hedge fund Polygon, which has also previously argued that Fox\u2019s offer undervalues Sky, said the British company could now be sold for more than 15 pounds-a-share.\u201dBoth Comcast and Disney have strong strategic reasons for owning Sky and we would hope that will result in an even better outcome for shareholders,\u201d Polygon portfolio manager Bechara Nasr said in a statement to Reuters.Polygon said in December that it held a small Sky stake.

It is the first time a U.S. pay TV provider has agreed to include Netflix in its channel bundles. For years, cable operators had been wary of competition from the Hollywood upstart, but many have now concluded that welcoming the streaming video giant will help fight cord cutting.  In a statement on Friday, the companies said Netflix will be available later this month through various Xfinity TV packages delivered through Comcast\u2019s X1 set-top box. Pricing was not disclosed.  Since 2016, Xfinity customers have been able to sign up for Netflix separately on X1. Offering Netflix as part of a package will simplify billing for customers, as Comcast will handle payments to Netflix.  Netflix made a similar arrangement in March with Sky Plc SKYB.L in Britain, one of several partnerships it has made to help bring in new customers.","93":"LONDON (Reuters) - Comcast Corp CMCSA.O on Wednesday raised its all-cash offer for Britain's Sky SKYB.L to $34 billion, topping a raised bid of $32.5 billion for the pay-TV group from Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA.O.  Fox, which has been trying to buy the pan-European group since December 2016, offered to pay 14 pounds per share, a 12 percent premium to Comcast\u2019s earlier offer.  Comcast on Wednesday increased its cash offer to 14.75 pounds per share. Sky shares closed at 15.15 pounds.  Comcast said its cash offer has been recommended by Sky\u2019s independent committee of directors.  The U.S. cable group gatecrashed Murdoch\u2019s attempt to buy the 61 percent of Sky his group did not already own in February, when Fox was still firmly stuck in the regulatory process.  The fight for Britain's leading pay-TV group is part of a bigger battle being waged in the entertainment industry as the world's media giants splash out tens of billions of dollars on deals to be able to compete with Netflix NFLX.O and Amazon.com AMZN.O.  Comcast and Walt Disney DIS.N are locked in a separate $70 billion-plus battle to buy most of Fox's assets, which would include Sky.  Disney secured conditional U.S. approval to buy the assets last month, giving it an edge over Comcast\u2019s bid.  Hong Kong-based hedge fund Case Equity Partners, a Sky investor, said the fact Disney was in a slightly more favourable position for Fox\u2019s U.S. media assets meant Comcast would fight even harder to get Sky.  \u201cToday\u2019s Fox bid is unlikely to be the end game as we see a final Sky deal outcome at well over 15 pounds per share,\u201d said managing partner Michael Wegener.  PRIME TIME DRAMA  Present in 23 million homes across Europe, Sky is a prized asset, with a slate of top sport and original drama content.  \u201cThis transformative transaction will position Sky so that it can continue to compete within an environment that now includes some of the largest companies in the world,\u201d Fox said.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Its offer represents an 82 percent premium to Sky\u2019s shares in 2016 before the takeover drama started, and a multiple of 21 times 2017 earnings per share.  However, British regulators have indicated that if Disney succeeds in buying Fox, including the 39 percent stake in Sky, it would be required to offer the same price for the remainder of Sky. According to some shareholders, that has set an implied higher floor for Sky\u2019s shares.  Hedge funds including Elliott have bought into Sky in recent months and other vocal shareholders such as Crispin Odey have demanded that the independent directors secure a better deal.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cIt\u2019s too low,\u201d Odey, a former son-in-law of Murdoch whose eponymous hedge fund is a Sky shareholder, said of the sweetened Fox offer.  \u201cDisney\u2019s internal forecasts now, on the basis of the cash flows they\u2019ve published for Sky, would value it at 16 pounds,\u201d he said.  Fox said Disney had given its consent to the additional debt Fox would take on and said that it would reimburse Fox by around 1 billion pounds if Fox succeeds in buying Sky at that price, but the Disney-Fox transaction falls through.  One hedge fund manager with a stake in Sky welcomed that pledge as a sign that Disney backed Fox in the battle.  Fox said the performance of Sky since 2016 justified its new bid. Analysts said it was not a knock-out, and Fox did not say it was its final offer.  \u201cFox coming back in for Sky isn\u2019t a surprise in itself, but the fact the offer is slightly behind what some had anticipated brings another twist,\u201d said George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.  The British government is expected to finally allow Fox, which is run by Rupert\u2019s son James, to buy Sky this week, after the U.S. group agreed to sell Sky\u2019s award-winning news channel to Disney to prevent Murdoch from owning too much of the British media.  Murdoch had previously tried to buy Sky in 2011 when a phone hacking scandal at his News of the World tabloid sparked a political backlash over his role in Britain. The opposition has not completely subsided despite the plan to spin off Sky News.  \u201cThere are enough sub-plots in the race to acquire Sky to commission a primetime drama,\u201d Salmon said.","94":"LOS ANGELES, Sept 11 (Reuters) - The National Football League\u2019s opening night game between the Houston Texans and Kansas City Chiefs averaged 20.3 million viewers on Comcast Corp\u2019s NBC television network and digital platforms, according to a preliminary estimate from NBC Sports.

(Reporting by Lisa Richwine Editing by Chris Reese)","95":"(Reuters) - U.S. cable company Comcast Corp's CMCSA.O proposal to buy Sky Plc SKYB.L for $31 billion has raised the specter of a potential bidding war between with Rupert Murdoch's Twenty First Century Fox FOXA.O and Walt Disney Co DIS.N.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Comcast, the owner of NBC, MSNBC and Universal Pictures, said on Tuesday it proposed to offer 12.50 pounds per share for Britain\u2019s Sky, more than the 10.75 pounds that Fox has agreed to pay for it.  Murdoch\u2019s Fox agreed to buy the 61 percent stake of Sky it did not already own in a cash deal in December 2016, but the takeover has been held up by regulators over concerns the media tycoon wields too much influence in Britain.  In December, Disney agreed to buy a number of Fox assets, including Fox\u2019s stake in Sky, in a separate $52-billion deal.  The next likely step is Comcast makes a firm offer, which would require the company to have its funding in place. Fox then could return with a higher offer.  Here are some of the scenarios on what may lie in store next for Sky:  FOX RAISES ITS BID  The most likely scenario, according to many analysts, is that Fox, with Disney\u2019s blessing, raises its bid, potentially prompting a bidding war with Comcast. Fox has to at least match Comcast\u2019s bid, but analysts estimate a final winning bid for Sky could go as high as 14 to 15 pounds per share. Sky\u2019s shares jumped Tuesday 20 percent, closing at 13.31 pounds, above Comcast\u2019s offer.  Under the terms of Fox\u2019s deal with Disney, Disney cannot bid for Sky on it own, so any bid would come from Fox. However, Disney CEO Bob Iger has spoken about the importance of Sky to Disney\u2019s plan to launch a global online streaming service. So it is likely that Disney would back Fox in bidding higher.  COMCAST WINS MAJORITY STAKE IN SKY  Fox could choose not to challenge Comcast, which has said its offer is contingent on acquiring more than 50 percent of Sky. Comcast would prefer to own the whole of Sky, so Fox could use its 39 percent stake in the company as a bargaining chip.  Once the its deal with Fox closes, Disney will own a majority stake in online streaming service Hulu in which Comcast is also a shareholder. Some investors have speculated that Disney could swap its controlling stake in Hulu as part of a deal for Comcast\u2019s stake in Sky.  Comcast is currently bound as a passive investor of Hulu, meaning it cannot buy more shares in the company, under its consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice when it bought NBCUniversal. However, that consent decree expires in September.  GOING ALL IN  There is an outside chance that Comcast could engage with Fox about buying the assets Disney is buying. Comcast had bid $60 billion before losing out to Disney, and sources have told Reuters that Comcast has been discussing bidding for the Fox assets again.  But such a deal would face significant regulatory hurdles in the U.S., which previously prompted Fox to snub Comcast\u2019s bid. There is no reason to believe that Fox\u2019s assessment of the regulatory risk will change.","96":"Comcast Center in New York. Image courtesy of the company.  LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Comcast boss Brian Roberts is driving a Sky-shaped wedge between Walt Disney and Twenty-First Century Fox. The U.S. cable group\u2019s 22 billion pound ($31 billion) offer for the UK pay-TV group leaves Fox chair Rupert Murdoch with two unappealing options: enter a bidding war for Sky, or re-think his deal to sell Fox\u2019s entertainment assets to Disney chief Bob Iger.  Sky investors owe a big thank you to a store employee near the group\u2019s London head office. Roberts\u2019 interest in the broadcaster firmed up after an hour-long demonstration of its flagship Sky Q TV product during a trip at the end of last year. Comcast is offering 12.50 pounds a share in cash for Sky, comfortably beating Fox\u2019s bid of 10.75 pounds per share for the 61 percent of the company it does not own.  Comcast\u2019s slim UK operations mean the bid should raise few competition concerns. Fox, by contrast, has been told by regulators that its bid risked giving the Murdoch clan too much influence over Britain\u2019s news agenda. It\u2019s now waiting publication of a final report that will spell out regulators\u2019 recommended remedies, such as a separate editorial board for Sky News. Media secretary Matt Hancock will have the final say in the summer.  Comcast reckons its expertise funnelling TV shows, sports and movies directly to homes makes it a better owner of Sky. How the $183 billion group\u2019s own shareholders will benefit is unclear: Comcast\u2019s offer contains lots of detail about supporting creative industries and young people in the UK, but little about financial returns. That may be because Roberts\u2019 real objective is to upset a $52 billion all-stock tie-up that Disney and Fox announced in December. Comcast still covets Fox\u2019s assets, Reuters reported earlier this month. Iger has described Sky as Fox\u2019s \u201ccrown jewel\u201d.  Comcast\u2019s offer will go ahead if just over 50 percent of Sky shareholders accept it. That means Murdoch\u2019s 39 percent stake will not be enough to block the deal. The 86-year-old mogul therefore has two options: revise the terms of the Disney sale to exclude Sky, or enter into a bidding war with Roberts. Sky shares jumped by a fifth on Tuesday morning and now trade almost 7 percent above Comcast\u2019s bid. Investors have placed their bets.","97":"(Updates with Comcast comment)  June 29 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp said on Friday services interrupted by two separate incidents of fiber cuts at its network providers were being restored.  \u201cOur engineers worked to address the issue immediately and services are now being restored to business and residential internet, video and voice customers,\u201d the company said in a statement.","98":"WASHINGTON, June 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear a bid by cable operator Comcast Corp to throw out racial bias claims accusing the company of discriminating against black-owned television channels.

Market reaction over Powell\u2019s nod to \u201cgradual\u201d rate increases was muted. \u201cGradual\u201d has been the operative word since the Fed began raising rates under Powell\u2019s predecessor, Janet Yellen, in late 2015.  Britain\u2019s top share index closed down 0.1 percent, with Sky soaring 20.5 percent as investors priced in a possible bidding war for the company following Comcast\u2019s surprise move. Rival broadcaster ITV rose 1 percent.  The offer from the $184 billion U.S. media giant could scupper the plans of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox to buy out Sky and sell it to Walt Disney.  That takeover has already been delayed by concerns for media plurality in Britain and whether Murdoch would be a \u201cfit and proper\u201d owner of such an important broadcaster.  \u201cRemember there is a $1.5 billion break Fox have to pay if the Fox\/Disney deal breaks,\u201d said from Neil Campling, Co-Head of the Global Thematic Group at Mirabaud Securities.  \u201cThere is no way we can see that Fox will walk away given how advanced the regulatory clearance process is. This bid marks a floor not an end to this particular saga. Let the battle commence.\u201d  Not everyone agreed, with Liberum analysts doubting Fox or Disney would get into a bidding war.  Investec said Disney may decide it has \u201cenough to do in the U.S. versus a contested European bid process.  Standard Chartered rose 1.2 percent after it joined rival UK banks in resuming dividend payments as profits soared, though weaker than expected revenue kept investor exuberance in check.  Gains were seen among housebuilders after Persimmon announced a more than doubling of dividend payments, a 25 percent jump in profits and a 7 percent increase in reservation rates.  Concerns over a downturn in the housing market have weighed on the industry in recent months, with a decline in mortgage approvals and the Bank of England raising benchmark interest rates.  Persimmon was forced to scale back its management bonus plan this week after widespread criticism that it could have netted bosses more than 200 million pounds from share options.  The cash return plan unveiled on Tuesday would make Persimmon the second-highest yielding housebuilding stock, said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.  \u201cPersimmon has gone a long way to calming at least one unhappy party by showering investors in the stock with a cash windfall of their own,\u201d said Mould.  Persimmon rose 4.7 percent, with Berkeley and Taylor Wimpey both up 0.8 percent.  Troubled subprime lender Provident Financial saw its shares surge 70.4 percent to their highest in six months after the company said it would raise 331 million pounds via a rights issue.

Overall revenue missed analyst estimates. Revenue from NBCUniversal\u2019s cable networks, filmed entertainment and theme parks also fell short of expectations in the seasonally weaker quarter.  Philadelphia-based Comcast is adapting to changes in consumer behavior as more people drop their cable television subscriptions in favor of streaming services like Netflix Inc .  Comcast said it lost 224,000 video customers in the quarter, more than the 121,000 it lost in the preceding quarter and topping the loss of 178,000 estimated by analysts, according to research firm FactSet.  Revenue from the high-speed internet business grew 9.4% to $4.66 billion in the second quarter as Comcast gained 209,000 subscribers. The net subscriber additions were slightly ahead of the average analyst estimate of 208,000, according to FactSet, but were down from 260,000 in the same period a year earlier.  Revenue at the NBCUniversal business, which includes NBC Entertainment and Universal Pictures, fell 0.8% to $8.21 billion.  In June, NBCUniversal announced it will pull reruns of the workplace comedy \u201cThe Office\u201d from Netflix in the United States in 2021, and will distribute the popular show on the advertising-supported TV streaming service it is launching in 2020, which will be free for NBCUniversal\u2019s pay-TV customers as well as Sky customers internationally.  Revenue in Comcast\u2019s filmed entertainment unit fell nearly 15% to $1.46 billion, reflecting a slate of films that underperformed compared to last year\u2019s blockbuster \u201cJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\u201d.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake - RC180497A970  (Reuters) - Comcast Corp\u2019s bid of 14.75 pounds for each Sky share will now remain open for acceptance until early October, the U.S. cable giant said on Wednesday, adding that it has received valid acceptances for shares representing 0.29 percent of Sky Plc to date.  London-based Sky has been at the center of a bidding war, which points to a bigger battle in the entertainment industry as media giants splash out tens of billions of dollars on deals to be able to compete with Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc.  Comcast, the world\u2019s biggest entertainment group, had countered Rupert Murdoch-controlled Fox\u2019s raised offer for Sky in July - within just a few hours - with an offer that valued London-listed Sky at $34 billion.  Nasdaq-listed Comcast said on Wednesday that Sky shareholders now have until Oct. 6 to accept its offer and the valid acceptances rose slightly to 0.29 percent from 0.21 percent reported in August.  Shares in Sky, which is 39 percent owned by Fox, have roughly doubled to 15.45 pounds from the 7.81 pounds they were trading at when Fox offered to buy the rest of the company in December, 2016.  Comcast\u2019s current offer, higher than Fox\u2019s 14 pound-a-share bid, has been recommended to shareholders by Sky\u2019s independent directors.  Fox currently has just ten days from now to trump Comcast\u2019s offer for Sky under British takeover rules.","106":"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s takeover regulator could take the rare step of intervening in the battle between Comcast and Twenty-First Century Fox for Sky next month by staging an auction for the broadcaster to bring the drawn-out bidding war to an end.  FILE PHOTO: The Sky News logo is seen on the outside of offices and studios in west London, Britain June 29, 2017. REUTERS\/Toby Melville\/File Photo  The Takeover Panel has the power to instigate a formal auction process for London-listed Sky SKYB.L to help resolve its future if two competing bids that have not been declared final remain on the table for the company on Sept. 22, according to Britain's takeover code.  There have only been three British takeover situations since 2007 that have involved auctions handled by the regulator, including the 6.2 billion-pound ($8.1 billion) sale of Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus to India's Tata Steel TISC.NS, according to analysis by Reuters.  A fourth battle ended just before an auction was due to start when Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L abandoned its takeover attempt of gas explorer Cove Energy in 2012, allowing Thailand's PTT Exploration & Production to clinch a $1.9 billion deal. That marked the last time the Panel invoked the auction procedure.  Cable giant Comcast CMCSA.O currently leads Rupert Murdoch's Fox FOXA.O in the fight for Sky with a 14.75 pound a share offer last month that values the broadcaster at 25.9 billion pounds and has been recommended by the pay-television group's independent directors.  That trumped the 14 pound a share offer made by Fox earlier in July for the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own, and is 37 percent above Fox\u2019s original 10.75 pound a share bid.  Sky\u2019s shares currently trade at 15.44 pounds.  Under the current timetable for a deal, which can be changed by the Panel, Fox and Comcast are free to lift their bids at any point up until the Sept. 22 deadline.  If neither suitor has admitted defeat by then, the regulator can step in and start an auction. The Panel did not comment.  The aim of an auction is to bring a protracted bidding war to a close by giving the suitors an opportunity to submit revised offers in an orderly process managed by the Panel, which remains neutral. But it can also serve to drive up the price that the successful suitor ultimately pays.  \u201cI hope it goes to an auction,\u201d said Crispin Odey, whose eponymous hedge fund is a top-20 shareholder in Sky. \u201cEvery day I look at that price and think: \u2018Why is it not at 18 pounds?\u2019\u201d  BATTLE FOR CORUS  In 2007, there were concerns that Tata overpaid for Corus after it became embroiled in a lengthy fight for the steelmaker with Brazilian firm Companhia Siderurgica Nacional.  The Panel eventually stepped in and ran an auction that went for nine rounds over the course of about eight hours and finished in the early hours of a Wednesday morning. Tata emerged the winner with a 608 pence a share offer, a third higher than its original 455 pence bid.  Tata\u2019s expensive foray into British steelmaking later proved problematic for the Indian group after overcapacity in Europe plunged the UK\u2019s steel industry into crisis in 2015.  It subsequently agreed a deal to create a European steel joint venture with Germany's ThyssenKrupp TKAG.DE earlier this year to help their operations withstand the pressures facing the industry.  Since the Corus sale, the Panel has tweaked the rules governing auctions so that unless the bidders and target agree an alternative procedure, the regulator runs a five-round process over five consecutive business days.  The suitors can announce revised offers by 5pm each day up until the fifth day, after which no new bids are allowed and the offers become final. The auction ends earlier than the fifth day if there is a round that draws no new offers.  The Sky battle is one part of a much broader consolidation sweeping the entertainment industry as the growth of Netflix NFLX.O and Amazon AMZN.O force the world's traditional media giants to spend tens of billions of dollars to keep pace.  Fox's existing 39 percent shareholding in Sky is part of a host of TV and film assets that Murdoch's group has agreed to sell to Walt Disney DIS.N for about $71 billion.  Comcast was also vying to buy those Fox assets until it dropped out of that battle in July to focus on taking control of Sky.

Comcast, the world\u2019s biggest entertainment company, set out its plans to keep Sky\u2019s news output independent and fully funded for 10 years to address any political concerns that a takeover could damage Britain\u2019s news market.  Its formal notification to the European Commission of its intention to buy Sky also put it on a similar regulatory timetable to Fox, despite entering the race 14 months later, with verdicts on both bids due next month.  Comcast is keen to prove to Sky\u2019s shareholders that it will face fewer regulatory hurdles in its $30 billion pursuit of Sky than Murdoch\u2019s Fox which has faced repeated delays in its bid to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own.  On Monday the bid battle, which already involves three of the world\u2019s biggest media companies after Disney agreed to buy some Fox assets including Sky, took a further twist when Reuters reported that Comcast is seeking to disrupt the broader Fox-Disney deal by preparing its own counter bid.  According to three people familiar with the matter, Comcast is asking investment banks to increase a bridge financing facility by as much as $60 billion so it can make an all-cash offer for the media assets that Twenty-First Century Fox Inc has agreed to sell to Walt Disney Co.  \u201cAs these big groups look to fight off the threat from the likes of Netflix and Amazon then scale becomes more and more important and you need scale and distribution,\u201d Numis media analyst Paul Richards said.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  \u201cYou can see why the Fox assets are so important and Sky is rolled in with that.\u201d  Sky is a British-based European pay-TV group that offers services in Britain, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy.  It agreed to be sold to its founder and 39-percent owner Fox in December 2016 but regulators and politicians have repeatedly intervened over concerns that the newspaper-owning Murdoch will have too much influence in Britain.  With Fox focused on getting approval, Comcast made its own shock bid for Sky in February, promising an easier approval process and a higher offer. It made its bid formal last month, and on Monday it notified the European Commission and will get an initial verdict on June 15.  On Tuesday it said it had agreed legally binding guarantees with Sky to fund its award-winning news output and to create a board to oversee its independence.  \u201cThe Sky News Binding Commitments will constitute legally binding commitments on Comcast and Sky which will be enforceable by the Sky News Board,\u201d Comcast said in a statement.  Murdoch\u2019s Fox has set out its own undertakings to protect the funding and independence of Sky News and is waiting to hear from Britain\u2019s media secretary on whether Fox should be allowed to buy Sky. The government will give its verdict on that offer on June 13.","109":"May 3 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp:  * ACCELERATED VESTING OF REMAINING 586,956 UNVESTED SHARES FROM WARRANT ORIGINALLY ISSUED TO UNIT OF COMCAST ON OCTOBER 5, 2016 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","110":"NEW YORK (IFR) - Comcast says it has \u201cHighly Confident Letters\u201d from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo for its US$65bn 21st Century Fox bid.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Comcast can boost its chances of snaring Fox. The cable company is preparing to scuttle Walt Disney\u2019s $52.4 billion bid for some of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media assets, and a major Fox shareholder is receptive to the idea. But Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts may want to offer more than just the best price to get a hearing.  On Wednesday, Comcast said it was in the advanced stages of putting together a competing proposal for Twenty-First Century Fox\u2019s movie studios, cable networks like FX, and international holdings. It plans to offer 16 percent more than Disney\u2019s share bid \u2013 and do so entirely in cash \u2014 and at least match the regulatory provisions and related termination fees. Disney has agreed to pay $2.5 billion, nearly 5 percent of the deal price, to Fox if watchdogs break up the deal.  Fox swatted away an offer from Comcast once before, in order to accept Disney\u2019s proposal. That suggests price may not be the only thing that counts. True, Murdoch will only have a 17 percent say in the matter, rather than the roughly 38 percent vote his family\u2019s trust wields in other circumstances. Yet what he wants still matters. Christopher Hohn\u2019s investment firm TCI disclosed more than a 7 percent stake in Fox on Wednesday and urged Murdoch to run a fair auction if Comcast formalizes its bid.  Roberts can give himself a head start by sweetening some other aspects of his offer. One is the break fee. The Department of Justice\u2019s case against AT&T\u2019s $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner looms in the background, and a verdict is due on June 12. If that deal gets approved, that could bolster Comcast\u2019s chances too. But that\u2019s not a given. Even if the DOJ loses, it could be emboldened to go after Comcast and Fox.  Roberts could therefore sweeten his potential offer by raising his break fee to $6 billion, or about 10 percent of the mooted $60 billion price tag. That would still be less than the 15 percent AT&T offered when it tried to merge with T-Mobile, but twice what Disney has offered. If Comcast is confident its M&A plans would pass Washington\u2019s smell test, it\u2019s an easy way to win the goodwill of Fox shareholders \u2013 and score a point against Disney right from the get-go.","116":"An AT&T logo is pictured in Pasadena, California, U.S., January 24, 2018.

Comcast, which dropped its pursuit of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's FOXA.O entertainment assets last week after a bidding war with Walt Disney Co DIS.N, is still in the hunt to acquire a controlling stake in European pay-TV company Sky PLC SKYB.L to expand internationally.  Shares of Comcast were up 3.7 percent to $34.66 in morning trading after the results.  Chief Executive Brian Roberts told investors on a conference call that Comcast walked away from its bid for the Fox assets because it could not justify the escalating price.  Sky posted double-digit earnings growth earlier on Thursday as it added another 500,000 customers, underscoring why Comcast is battling Fox to acquire a majority stake in the company.  Comcast\u2019s revenue from high-speed internet customers rose 9.3 percent to $4.26 billion during the second quarter as it added 260,000 internet subscribers, above the average estimate of 200,000 from analysts at MoffettNathanson and Macquarie.  Comcast said it has increased its marketing for internet-only subscribers, since internet has higher profit margins than cable, which are diminished by TV programming costs.  The growth in internet connections is \u201cmore than offsetting the pressure on video and the outlook for the second half of the year is strong,\u201d said Kevin Roe, an analyst at Roe Equity Research.  Comcast, the biggest U.S. cable provider, shed 140,000 video customers during the quarter, up from 34,000 customers in the prior-year quarter, as TV viewers opt for cheaper streaming options, such as AT&T Inc's T.N newly launched WatchTV at $15.  While streaming platforms will continue to pressure Comcast\u2019s cable TV business, it will increase demand for high-speed broadband, said Roberts.  Net income attributable to Comcast rose 27.6 percent to $3.2 billion, or 69 cents per share, from $2.5 billion, or 52 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding adjustments, Comcast earned 65 cents per share, up from 52 cents per share last year, beating analyst estimates of 60 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Comcast\u2019s revenue rose 2.1 percent from the previous year to $21.7 billion but fell short of analyst estimates of $21.86 billion.  Revenue from NBCUniversal was flat year on year, because of a revenue decline for its movie studios, as hit movie \u201cJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\u201d opened late in the quarter.","121":"-- Source link: on.wsj.com\/2zzIdf4  -- Note: Reuters has not verified this story and does not vouch for its accuracy","122":"FILE PHOTO: Ajit Pai, Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, speaks at the WSJTECH Live conference in Laguna Beach, California, U.S., October 21, 2019. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  (Reuters) - A little-used block of spectrum set aside for auto safety should be split to accommodate the rapidly growing number of wireless devices, the chairman of the U.S. telecoms regulator said on Wednesday, a plan that sets up a clash between two major industries.  A block of the 5.9 GHz spectrum band was reserved in 1999 for automakers to develop technology to allow vehicles to talk to each other, but it has so far gone largely unused.  Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Ajit Pai proposed on Wednesday shifting more than half of that for Wi-Fi use, keeping the remaining spectrum for auto safety communications. The FCC will hold an initial vote on the proposal Dec. 12.  However, the U.S. Transportation Department reiterated Wednesday that the entire spectrum block is critical to future auto safety advances and should not be split. The auto industry has been developing technology to allow vehicles to exchange data about their location, speed and direction to help avoid accidents and to exchange information with infrastructure.  A group representing nearly all major automakers and including advocates for the blind and cyclists on Wednesday urged the FCC not to act until it could complete testing to establish if the spectrum can be shared safely, citing the 36,000 annual U.S. road deaths and more than 2 million injuries.  Prior government studies have suggested the technology, if widely adopted among U.S. vehicles, could prevent 600,000 crashes annually. The group says the technology applications require \u201cdedicated spectrum to make sure they work right every time without signal interference.\u201d  Pai said the FCC had to make more spectrum available for Wi-Fi, which connects everything from \u201cTVs, thermostats, baby monitors, refrigerators, washing machines, toys, and even toilets.\u201d  Previously, the FCC had explored if automakers and Wi-Fi devices should share the same spectrum block. Pai said \u201cfurther testing would be needed to carry out a complex sharing regime, and more testing would mean this valuable spectrum would likely lie fallow for several years.\u201d  Major cable and content companies have urged the FCC to open the spectrum band to Wi-Fi use. Comcast Corp CMCSA.O said Wednesday, \"this spectrum is too valuable a national resource to lie fallow any longer.\"","123":"May 14 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co said it has signed a pact with Comcast Corp to assume full operational control of Hulu, effective immediately.

The U.S. cable giant bid 17.28 pounds a share for control of London-listed Sky, bettering a 15.67 pounds-a-share offer by Fox, Britain\u2019s Takeover Panel said.  Buying Sky will make Philadelphia-based Comcast, which owns the NBC network and Universal Pictures, the world\u2019s largest pay-TV operator with around 52 million customers.  Chairman and chief executive Brian Roberts has had his eye on Sky as a way to help counter declines in subscribers for traditional cable TV in its core U.S. market as viewers switch to video-on-demand services like Netflix and Amazon .  \u201cThis is a great day for Comcast,\u201d he said. \u201cThis acquisition will allow us to quickly, efficiently and meaningfully increase our customer base and expand internationally.\u201d  Comcast\u2019s knock-out offer thwarted Murdoch\u2019s long-held ambition to win control of Sky, and is also a setback for U.S. entertainment giant Walt Disney which would have likely been its ultimate owner.  Disney has agreed a separate $71 billion deal to buy most of Fox\u2019s film and TV assets, including its existing 39 percent stake in Sky, and would have taken full ownership after a successful Fox takeover.  Comcast\u2019s final offer was a jump on its bid going into the auction of 14.75 pounds, and compares with Sky\u2019s closing price of 15.85 pounds on Friday.  Comcast believed it needed to deliver a knock-out blow given that Fox\u2019s existing stake in Sky gave it a chance of victory if it was a close second to Comcast, two sources said.  Its final offer - more than double Sky\u2019s share price before Fox made its approach in December 2016 - quickly won the backing of Sky\u2019s independent directors on Saturday.  \u201cWe are recommending it as it represents materially superior value,\u201d said Martin Gilbert, chairman of Sky\u2019s independent committee. \u201cWe are focused on drawing this process to a successful and swift close and therefore urge shareholders to accept the recommended Comcast offer.\u201d  Fox noted the recommendation, saying it was considering options for its 39 percent stake and would make another announcement in due course.  \u201cSky is a remarkable story and we are proud to have played such a significant role in building the incredible value reflected today in Comcast\u2019s offer,\u201d Fox said.  Fox\u2019s holding, which Comcast\u2019s offer values at more than $15 billion, stems from Murdoch\u2019s role in the creation of the company nearly three decades ago.  His younger son James was pivotal in building Sky into Europe\u2019s leading pay-TV operator as its former chief executive and current chairman.  Comcast, which requires 50 percent plus one share of Sky\u2019s equity to win control, said it was also seeking to buy Sky shares in the market.  HUGE PRICE  One fund manager who holds Sky shares said nobody could complain about the Comcast price.  \u201cThe question now is if Fox actually sells out and if not can Comcast get to 50 percent,\u201d he said.  One banker involved in the auction said: \u201cDid Comcast pay a lot more than they needed to?\u201d  Sources familiar with the matter said Fox, Disney and Comcast had not been in discussions about the 39 percent stake.  The auction was a dramatic climax to a transatlantic bidding battle waged since February, when Comcast gate-crashed Fox\u2019s takeover of Sky.  It is a blow to 87-year-old Murdoch, who tried to buy Sky eight years ago only for the bid to collapse in the fallout from a phone-hacking scandal at his British newspaper business.  Some politicians have opposed a deal, citing concerns about the influence Murdoch would wield over the UK\u2019s news agenda.  Fox made a string of concessions to assuage those worries and land a company that serves 23 million households in Britain, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy.  Sky\u2019s chief executive Jeremy Darroch said Comcast\u2019s victory was the beginning of a new chapter. \u201cSky has never stood still, and with Comcast our momentum will only increase,\u201d he said.

The Comcast NBC logo is shown on a building in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 13, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  The federal judge\u2019s ruling in favor of the US$85bn AT&T\/Time Warner tie-up, first announced in October 2016, without any conditions, removed an obstacle for debt markets after several huge, high profile technology and healthcare deals were scuttled by antitrust or national security concerns.  \u201cAfter the AT&T news, people have a much more optimistic view on the regulatory front, and I think that will push bankers to pitch more on M&A,\u201d said one senior banker. \u201cThere\u2019s more of a willingness to look at vertical integrations,\u201d in which a company buys a supplier.  Comcast, in announcing its Walt Disney Co-topping bid, said it had \u201chighly confident\u201d letters from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo that the banks can secure the needed financing for the proposed acquisition.  A considerable amount of the needed financing was already put in place before this newly raised bid. In April, the company said it lined up \u00a323bn (US$32bn) of loans led by BAML and Wells Fargo.  The existing credit comprises up to \u00a316bn of 364-day bridge loans and up to \u00a37bn of term loans, with the bridge expected to be replaced in part or in full by senior unsecured bonds, LPC previously reported.  BAML and Wells Fargo declined to comment.  The AT&T victory \u201cdoes make people feel a bit more of a risk appetite for complex transactions on the regulatory front,\u201d said another banker.  Vertical transactions tend to be better for the M&A market because they allow companies to get into complementary areas for growth, as opposed to horizontal deals which focus more on synergies and cost cutting, he said. \u201cThat can be pretty helpful to the overall M&A market.\u201d  Corporations buying other companies for growth have helped drive total M&A lending up to US$326bn so far this year, a 39% leap above the same time last year, according to LPC data.  Attention shifts next to Disney, and whether it answers Comcast\u2019s bid by increasing its US$52bn all-stock agreement to purchase Fox\u2019s film, television and international businesses.  And still in the regulatory review line is T-Mobile\u2019s US$26bn proposed merger with Sprint, two leading wireless carrier competitors, in what is considered a horizontal deal.  HIGHLY CONFIDENT  As for Comcast\u2019s new financing, banks typically provide \u201chighly confident\u201d letters as a tactic used for large hostile takeovers, that allows borrowers to avoid paying fees on funds committed by banks to a huge deal that may not take place.  Banks do not immediately tie up their balance sheets, as a result, while signaling to markets that financing will be there if the deal is approved.  Similarly, five initial banks indicated their confidence this way last November for chipmaker Broadcom\u2019s unsolicited bid to buy rival Qualcomm. The lending group was later expanded and provided US$100bn of financing \u2013 the largest loan package ever \u2013 before the deal was ultimately canceled as President Trump blocked the merger over national security concerns.  Banks remain eager to put money to work and see a more open dealmaking path after the AT&T\/Time Warner merger outcome.  \u201cNow that the judge has given the all-clear, without conditions, it\u2019s basically a free ride, and this will open up other opportunities for companies in the space that need to position themselves,\u201d a third banker said.","127":"A British Sky Broadcasting Group (BSkyB) logo is seen at the company's UK headquarters in west London July 25, 2014.

REUTERS\/Toby Melville\/  LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Comcast has overreached in its pursuit of Sky. The U.S. cable giant prevailed over Twenty-First Century Fox on Saturday, winning a dramatic one-day auction with an offer that values the UK broadcaster at 30.6 billion pounds ($40 billion). For Chief Executive Brian Roberts, it\u2019s a huge bet on overseas growth for a company that cannot get much larger at home.  The shoot-out marked the climax of Comcast\u2019s audacious seven-month attempt to snatch Sky from founder Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox - which owns 39 percent of the UK company - and Walt Disney, which is buying the media mogul\u2019s U.S. entertainment assets. Comcast\u2019s offer values Sky shares at 17.28 pounds each. That\u2019s 17 percent more than the U.S. group had previously offered, and a staggering 61 percent premium to the 10.75 pounds per share that Fox first proposed in December 2016. Comcast is also paying almost 3 billion pounds more for Sky than Fox and Disney\u2019s best and final offer.  That comfortable margin should ensure Sky investors rush to sell or tender their shares, giving the cable group the 50 percent plus one share it needs to succeed. It also increases the chances that Fox and Disney will cash in their 12 billion pound stake rather than using it as a bargaining chip in future deals.  However, Roberts will struggle to justify the deal on any conventional valuation metric. Including debt, the offer values Sky at more than 15 times its EBITDA for the year to June 2018, almost twice the multiple that investors attach to the Philadelphia-based group. Comcast reckons it can add about 400 million pounds a year to Sky\u2019s bottom line through a combination of cutting costs and boosting revenue. Even factoring in these benefits, though, Comcast\u2019s investment will earn a return of little more than 5 percent after tax by 2020, Breakingviews calculates. That is well below Sky\u2019s cost of capital.  The $174 billion company will doubtless point to past deals, such as its 2011 takeover of NBC Universal, as evidence that it can make a success of acquisitions that look expensive at the time. Recent consolidation also underscores the scarcity of media assets: witness Disney\u2019s enthusiastic pursuit of Fox\u2019s businesses. Sky will give Comcast greater international clout as it squares up to new media giants such as Netflix. Even if Roberts is ultimately proved right, however, it will take years for him to dispel the suspicion that he has reached too high for Sky.","130":"FILE PHOTO: The NBC and Comcast logo are displayed on top of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, formerly known as the GE building, in midtown Manhattan in New York July 1, 2015.

The European Commission said the deal did not raise any competition concerns, confirming a Reuters story last week.  \u201cThe proposed transaction would lead to only a limited increase in Sky\u2019s existing share of the markets for the acquisition of TV content, as well as in the market for the wholesale supply of TV channels in the relevant member states,\u201d the EU competition agency said on Friday.  Comcast, the world\u2019s biggest entertainment company, is fighting Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Twenty-First Century Fox for Sky.","139":"(Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In January Ellie Mitchell started getting a barrage of texts and emails from her internet service provider, warning her she was running out of data.  \u201cThe messages kept coming: \u2018You\u2019ve used 75%, 80%, 90%...\u2019\u201d Mitchell, director of youth nonprofit Maryland Out of School Time Network, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview.  \u201cIt felt like we were being held hostage,\u201d said Mitchell, who was working from home in Baltimore, Maryland alongside her husband and their two children attending school online.  Comcast Corp, one of the largest internet providers in the United States, announced in November it would be capping data usage for residential customers not on an unlimited plan in several cities in the northeast.  Customers who use more than 1.2 terabytes (TB) of data are charged $10 for every additional 50 gigabytes, up to a maximum of $100.  The move drew the ire of elected officials and digital rights activists in Baltimore, who have been calling on the company to make broadband accessible for all students during the pandemic.  With millions forced to work and learn from home, COVID-19 has laid bare the digital divide across the country, with technological inequality disproportionately affecting poor and minority communities.  Some 16 million children, or 30% of all U.S. public school students, lack either an internet connection or a device at home adequate for distance learning, according to the Boston Consulting Group.  \u201cWe see (the Comcast cap) as preying on people\u2019s vulnerability,\u201d Baltimore city councilman Zeke Cohen said in a phone interview.  \u201cThis decision to add a data cap is particularly harmful to Black and brown people, and poor people, who are already living paycheck to paycheck and can\u2019t afford additional fees.\u201d  A Comcast company spokesman said that only about 5% of its customers would regularly go over the 1.2 TB limit, adding that it had a policy of working with customers on payment plans if they could not afford their bills.  On Jan. 26, Cohen, two other council members and the Baltimore Digital Equity Coalition (BDEC), sent a letter to Maryland\u2019s Attorney General, requesting he investigate Comcast for price gouging.  \u2018UPSET FAMILIES\u2019  When Baltimore\u2019s public schools first went remote in March 2020, Aliyah Abid was a high-school senior and a member of the group Students Organizing a Multicultural and Open Society (SOMOS), which pushed Comcast to make broadband quicker and cheaper.  \u201cThese days, the internet is how you access your education - so, with Comcast we are being asked to pay for a public education that\u2019s supposed to be free,\u201d she said.  \u201cAnd not everyone is privileged enough to just not think about that.\u201d  In July, SOMOS launched a petition asking Comcast to ensure students in the city could get online for free during the COVID-19 crisis.  Chief among their demands was improving the speed and lowering the cost of the \u201cInternet Essentials\u201d program, a discounted plan for low-income customers that costs $9.95 per month.  That service caps download speeds at 25 megabytes per second (MB) and uploads at 3 MB, speeds that meet the basic federal definition of \u201cbroadband\u201d.  \u201cWhat we are hearing from students is that the speed is abysmal for Essentials,\u201d said Adam Echelman, BDEC co-founder and executive director of the nonprofit Libraries Without Borders.  \u201cThis is a real problem right now, because you can\u2019t write an essay on your smartphone - you need a good internet to stay in touch with your teachers.\u201d  Kristerfer Burnett, a Baltimore city councilman who co-signed the letter to the Attorney General demanding the Comcast investigation, said his office was fielding a barrage of complaints from families struggling to get online.  \u201cWe are getting bombarded with upset families who are saying that only one of their children can be on the internet at a time,\u201d he said.  Comcast said it would be increasing the Essentials speed this week.  \u201cWe\u2019re continually improving our Internet Essentials program and have increased speeds multiple times, including today to 50 MB (and) 5 MB, all while keeping the price at $9.95\/month for the last decade,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement.  \u201cThese speeds support multiple concurrent video conferencing sessions and enable family members to learn and work from home.\u201d  Comcast also cited research from nonprofit CableLabs and Common Sense Media, a children\u2019s advocacy group, indicating that the previous Essentials speed should be able to accommodate video conferencing.  AT&T, another major internet service provider, previously suspended its data coverage charges through the end of 2020, and announced it would waive the data caps it places on its low-income plans through June 2021.  DIGITAL DIVIDE  Like many American cities marred by residential segregation, the distribution of internet to homes in Baltimore is highly unequal, said John Horrigan, a senior fellow at the Technology Policy Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C.  In his research, Horrigan has found that 206,000 African-American households in Maryland state were without a wireline broadband connection in 2020.  A report he published in May 2020 showed that in Baltimore alone, more than 40% of households did not have a fixed line connection, with many homes using their phones to access the internet.  \u201cHaving good internet is extremely important to people\u2019s emotional wellbeing at this time - not having access leads to both economic and social exclusion,\u201d he said.  The primary reason families lack broadband, he said, is that they cannot afford the monthly bill. The new caps, he said, would further entrench the notion that data is a scarce, and expensive, resource.  Comcast is now weathering nationwide criticism of its data caps, which critics see as leveraging its dominant position in the broadband market during a crisis.  According to a 2020 report by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR), a group critical of major telecom firms, 22 million U.S. customers living in Comcast service areas have no other option for broadband service.  California congresswoman Anna Eshoo sent the company a letter in December asking it to suspend all data caps until after the pandemic.  Comcast had already waived its caps on data in California and other places states until the end of the 2020 school year.  The company said that the alerts being sent now to customers will not translate into additional charges until their August 2021 bill, and the messages were only meant to help customers decide if they should change to a plan with more data.  Unless something changes, Mitchell said she will likely have to start paying the additional $30 a month for an unlimited plan.  \u201cThis is our work lifeline, this is our education lifeline - so we either have to ration or just add another thing to our monthly budget,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cIt\u2019s death by a thousand cuts.\u201d","140":"Aug 6 (Reuters) - Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal said on Thursday the chairman of NBC Entertainment will leave the company, as part of a reorganization of its TV and streaming video businesses.

The milestone widens its greater coverage over telecoms rivals. Competitor Verizon Communications Inc races to deploy its next-generation 5G wireless service on mobile phones and in the home with speeds theoretically rivaling cable company products. Verizon launched its home internet 5G service in October, the first commercial offering of its kind in the United States.  Comcast\u2019s high-speed internet business is one of its biggest contributors to revenue and profit as customers for its video services decline. The segment has helped prop up the media and communications conglomerate\u2019s finances.  So-called cord cutters, many of whom continue to rely on broadband providers such as Comcast for internet services, have started defecting to video-streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu and Youtube TV for television programming.  That trend sparked a wave of media company mergers. Walt Disney Co struck a deal to buy 21st Century Fox for $71.3 billion and AT&T Inc bought Time Warner for $85 billion, and both have vowed to build streaming video services for consumers looking for a lower-cost alternative to traditional pay television services.

FILE PHOTO: The NBC logo and Comcast are displayed on 30 Rockefeller Plaza, formerly known as the GE building, in midtown Manhattan in New York July 23, 2015. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Fifteen months after finally agreeing a takeover of Sky, Murdoch had been edging towards approval by offering remedies to overcome long-held concerns that he holds too much media sway in Britain, where he owns the Sun and Times newspapers.  But Comcast, the owner of NBC and Universal, has made investors a higher offer with no political baggage for a business that Murdoch helped to launch and owns 39 percent of.  Fox has called on regulators to submit Comcast to the same lengthy scrutiny it received, but competition lawyers say it could gain clearance in a relatively fast probe.  COMCAST\u2019S OFFER  Comcast offered 12.50 pounds per share, or 22.1 billion pounds ($31 billion). It has not yet made a firm bid and is sounding out investors through its brokers, BAML, sources say.  It wants to own all of Sky but will accept taking control with 50 percent plus one share if Fox decides not to sell its 39 percent stake. Fox has a separate deal to sell assets to Walt Disney DIS.N, including Sky.  FOX\u2019S OFFER  Murdoch agreed to buy the 61 percent of Sky it did not already own in December 2016 for 10.75 pounds per share, valuing the entire business at 18.5 billion pounds.  This followed a failed attempt to buy Sky in 2010, which collapsed when journalists at one of Murdoch\u2019s papers admitted hacking into phones to secure news, sparking a criminal trial, a public inquiry and questions over his role.  LEVEL OF ACCEPTANCE  One person familiar with the matter said Comcast was asking hedge fund managers how much Sky stock they controlled, indicating a belief that Fox will hold on to its stake and setting the stage for a lengthy battle.  UBS said the price could go as high as 1500 pence, driven by the fact Sky has continued to develop its technology since Fox\u2019s bid and last month secured the rights to show Premier League matches for a lower fee than expected, boosting future earnings.  Comcast will need 82 percent acceptance from independent Sky shareholders while Fox is targeting 75 percent, meaning 15 percent of independent investors could block the deal.  COMCAST\u2019S REGULATORY CHALLENGE  Comcast is providing information to the European Commission and believes it can get approval in the so-called Phase 1 of the investigation, avoiding a prolonged process. It could take several weeks before Comcast files a formal notification.  Brussels will examine whether a Comcast-owned Sky could be anti-competitive when dealing with rival channels on its platform and whether there is a threat from putting Sky in the same company as film studio Universal.  The regulator could also consider if Sky would be owned by companies holding three of the six major film studios if Comcast owns 61 percent and Walt Disney retains Murdoch\u2019s 39 percent.  Comcast would argue that were Fox or Disney to retain 39 percent, they would be a financial investor with no commercial or operational link with Sky.  In terms of previous conduct, Comcast was accused by U.S. regulators in 2012 of breaching a condition imposed when it bought NBC Universal, by discriminating against rivals in favor of its own channels when placing them on the program guide.  Comcast says it appealed the decision and the two sides settled in 2014. It also agreed to pay $2.3 million to resolve a federal investigation into allegations it wrongfully charged customers for services they never authorized.  In Britain, Comcast has been involved in some minor breaches of broadcasting rules for airing offensive language, breaking impartiality and advertising rules, and it was sanctioned and fined in 2012 for broadcasting soft porn during the day on a channel that could be watched by children.  Fox has called on regulators to examine all these issues.  But Howard Cartlidge, head of EU and Competition law at DWF, said a larger pattern of offences would need to be proved to force a longer EU investigation: \u201cI don\u2019t see there being significant regulatory hurdles.\u201d  Lawyers do not expect the UK government to launch a public interest test either as Comcast does not own newspapers - the issue that has caused so many delays for Fox.  FOX\u2019S REGULATORY CHALLENGE  The EU cleared Fox\u2019s 2016 bid in a Phase 1 investigation on competition grounds, however British politicians, wary of appearing close to the Murdoch family, have bounced the deal to local regulators on the issue of media plurality and standards.  UK regulators accepted Fox would uphold broadcasting standards, saying that sexual harassment allegations at the Fox News network in the U.S. did not call into question its commitment to standards in Britain.  On media plurality, the Competition and Markets Authority said in January the deal should be blocked unless a way is found to prevent the Murdochs from influencing the network\u2019s news operations.  Fox has since pledged to keep Sky News independent and fully funded for 10 years. Lawyers and analysts said that should be enough to secure regulatory approval.  Fox sees the fact it has almost received regulatory approval as a competitive advantage over Comcast. It is pursuing the Sky takeover because it is part of its larger deal with Disney.  \u201cWith Disney now being the ultimate buyer for Sky rather than Fox, we think political opposition to the deal may be easing,\u201d UBS said.  TIMEFRAME  After notification, Brussels has 25 working days to analyze Comcast\u2019s deal during Phase 1. Any offer of remedies could add 10 working days.  For Fox, the UK regulator will give its final report to government by May 1 and a final decision will come by mid-June.","149":"FILE PHOTO: The Comcast NBC logo is shown on a building in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 13, 2018.

REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  The largest U.S. cable company\u2019s third-quarter results demonstrated a resilience to industry forces that have buffeted its rivals.  As U.S. subscribers have continued to dump pricier pay-TV services in favor of cheaper streaming services, Comcast has managed to slow down defections, at least for a quarter, while growing its broadband services, on which all other products, including Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Amazon.com AMZN.O video, depend. High-speed internet is now the centerpiece of a strategy to survive a rapidly changing media landscape.  It also has remained the standalone among the big league players to resist the temptation to restructure to court consumers directly with streaming video products, as AT&T Inc T.N and Walt Disney Co DIS.N have done.  \u201cWe\u2019re looking at different ways to accelerate our business in terms of streaming,\u201d said Steve Burke, Chief Executive of NBCUniversal, which is owned by Comcast, on a conference call with analysts on Thursday. Burke added that it would not be a substitute for its existing pay TV business.  Shares rose 4.5 percent to $35.66.  BLUE SKIES  To diversify, Comcast beat Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA.O in an auction to buy European satellite TV broadcaster Sky SKYB.L for $40 billion in September.  Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts defended what was widely considered a high bid for Sky and said the company \u201cwas misunderstood and mispriced,\u201d citing the difference in the European pay-TV markets compared to mature U.S. markets.  In a morning conference call, Sky Chief Executive Jeremy Darroch discussed investments in key categories such as original content and defend its leadership position in sports and movies.  Darroch also said Sky could easily capture 10 percent more of the remaining 78 million households that do not yet subscribe to a Sky product across its European territories, which would add 8 million customers. \u201cIt\u2019s more than achievable,\u201d he said.  He also vowed to \u201cstick around,\u201d which will help assuage investors concerned he would flee after the merger.  STRONG RESULTS  The results showed revenue from high-speed internet rose 9.6 percent to $4.32 billion in the quarter as the company added 363,000 internet subscribers, beating an average estimate of 294,000, according to research firm FactSet.  Comcast said it was the best performance for the division in ten years.  Net income attributable to Comcast rose 9.2 percent to $2.89 billion, or 62 cents per share, from $2.64 billion, or 55 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, the company earned 65 cents. Analysts were expecting 61 cents per share, according to Refinitiv.  Philadelphia-based Comcast\u2019s revenue rose 5 percent to $22.14 billion, above the average estimate of $21.82 billion.  Comcast's Xfinity Mobile, which operates off of Verizon Communication Inc's VZ.N network, added 228,000 net phone lines during the quarter, hitting 1 million total lines. CEO Roberts said that offering mobile with broadband has improved retention of broadband customers who buy both.  NBCUniversal revenue rose 8.1 percent to $8.63 billion.  Revenue from theme parks fell due to weather-related disruptions and natural disasters in Japan.","157":"FILE PHOTO: NBCUniversal vice chairman Ron Meyer poses at the premiere for the film \"Good Boys\" in Los Angeles, California, U.S., August 14, 2019. REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni  (Reuters) - NBCUniversal Vice Chairman Ron Meyer left the Comcast Corp CMCSA.O-owned company on Tuesday, after disclosing that he had made a settlement with a woman with whom he had a consensual affair years ago.  In a statement, Meyer said he had been the target of an extortion effort from people who learned of the settlement, which he said he had made under threat.  Meyer, who had been with the company for 25 years and is one of the most powerful figures in Hollywood, said \u201cparties learned of the settlement and have continuously attempted to extort me into paying them money or else they intended to falsely implicate NBCUniversal, which had nothing to do with this matter, and to publish false allegations about me.\u201d  He did not give details about the amount of the settlement, or when it was made.  In a statement, NBCUniversal Chief Executive Officer Jeff Shell said: \u201cLate last week Ron Meyer informed NBCUniversal that he had acted in a manner which we believe is not consistent with our company policies or values. Based on Ron\u2019s disclosure of these actions, we have mutually concluded that Ron should leave the company, effective immediately.\u201d","158":"People dressed as cartoon characters Mickey and Minnie greet visitors with their latest Year of the Mouse costumes at Hong Kong Disneyland January 21, 2008. REUTERS\/Bobby Yip  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - It\u2019s been a year of media madness. Comcast\u2019s $40 billion lurch for Sky set a new standard for excess. Walt Disney too paid an extravagant sum for parts of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s empire, including a stake in the UK pay-TV group. Selling it would allow CEO Bob Iger to reduce the Magic Kingdom\u2019s debt or add firepower to battle streaming rivals like Netflix.  In a rare closed-bid auction on Saturday, the U.S. cable firm emerged victorious with its 17.28 pounds-a-share bid, beating Fox\u2019s offer of 15.67. To gain control, Comcast needs Sky investors to hand over at least 51 percent of their shares. But with such a lavish price \u2013 more than 100 percent above Sky\u2019s undisturbed price before Fox\u2019s 2016 attempt \u2013 the decision is a no brainer.  The moolah is far more valuable to the Mouse House than retaining a minority stake in Sky. Iger had to stretch his original bid for Fox\u2019s assets by some 36 percent to $71 billion after Comcast entered the fray. Half of that is in cash, which will push Disney\u2019s debt to more than three times EBITDA, executives said on a call in June.  Disney\u2019s net debt will rise to about $73 billion, according to a Breakingviews calculation. Selling its stake to Comcast would bring in about $15 billion. Plus, a requirement by U.S. watchdogs to sell Fox\u2019s regional sports networks might bring in another $16 billion, reckons Bernstein analysts. After Disney gives Uncle Sam its share, it could pocket $25 billion.  That money could put Disney\u2019s leverage back in the comfort zone. Based on Bernstein\u2019s 2019 projections, Disney is on track to make around $21 billion in EBITDA next year, adding in cost savings from the deal and backing out Sky and the sports networks. Using Sky proceeds to pay down debt would lower Disney\u2019s ratio to around two times EBITDA.  Or it could take the kitty and invest in its direct-to-consumer streaming video service. Netflix and Amazon are increasing the stakes, spending billions of dollars on TV shows and movies. Disney may be satisfied with its content, but it could always use a technology upgrade. Either way, Comcast\u2019s lunatic spending gives Disney a shot at sanity.","159":"LONDON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - A banker from one of Britain\u2019s leading boutique advisory firms pressed the button on Comcast\u2019s knockout $40 billion bid for broadcaster Sky.  The U.S. cable giant emerged victorious on Saturday evening from its protracted battle with Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Twenty-First Century Fox for London-listed Sky with a 17.28 pounds-a-share offer.  That far surpassed the 15.67 pounds-a-share final bid made by Fox, which was seeking to acquire the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own. If Comcast had only offered marginally more than Fox, Murdoch\u2019s company could have fought on for control of Sky because its stake would have given it an upper hand.  \u201cWhen you\u2019re competing against a 39 percent shareholder you\u2019ve got to be quite aggressive,\u201d said a source close to Comcast.  Murdoch\u2019s group was backed by Walt Disney, which has struck a separate deal to buy the bulk of Fox\u2019s television and film assets, including the Sky stake, and which would have eventually taken ownership of the Sky if Fox had beaten Comcast.  The winner was decided by a rare auction process orchestrated by the Takeover Panel, which regulates mergers and acquisition activity in Britain. The Sky takeover is the biggest deal that has ever gone to such a process in the UK.  Brian Roberts, Comcast\u2019s chief executive, was based in a hotel in London\u2019s West End for the duration of the auction, according to a source with knowledge of the matter. He was with a team of advisers that included investment banks Evercore and Bank of America and boutique firm Robey Warshaw.  Bids were submitted to the panel by email to a secure website set up by the regulator and it was Philip Apostolides, a banker at Robey Warshaw, who was responsible for sending the cable giant\u2019s winning offer, according to two sources.  Robey Warshaw declined to comment.  Based in a townhouse in London\u2019s upmarket Mayfair district, the boutique was founded by investment bankers Sir Simon Robey, Simon Warshaw and Apostolides in 2013 and since then has worked on some of Britain\u2019s biggest takeovers.  Comcast has been vying for Sky since February, when it gate-crashed Fox\u2019s deal to buy the London-listed pay-TV group. Fox first agreed to take control of the broadcaster in December 2016 but its takeover was held up by intense regulatory scrutiny in the UK.  To bring the lengthy bidding war to an end, the panel announced on Thursday that it would hold a one-day auction in private lasting a maximum of three rounds, to force the rival suitors to declare their best and final offers for Sky.  Going in to the auction, Comcast had bid 14.75 pounds a share for the British company and Fox had offered 14 pounds.  The auction went the distance, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Fox opened the bidding in the first stage, with Comcast responding with a revised bid in the second round. The level of these bids is not known.  Both bidders could make offers in the third and final round in what were blind bids.

FILE PHOTO: The NBC logo and Comcast are displayed on 30 Rockefeller Plaza, formerly known as the GE building, in midtown Manhattan in New York July 23, 2015. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  The world's biggest entertainment company shocked the market on Tuesday when it said it had approached Sky about a deal, challenging Rupert Murdoch's Twenty First Century Fox FOXA.O and Walt Disney Co DIS.N which had already hatched a complex plan to take control of the pay-TV group.  The Commission website shows no formal request has been made yet but a spokesman for Comcast said it had made an informal notification to get the ball rolling.  Comcast, the owner of NBC, CNBC and MSNBC, said it went public with its approach because it wanted to start the regulatory review. It believes it only has a narrow window to get the deal done before Fox nears completion of its own takeover of the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own.  Comcast\u2019s action complicates a separate move by Disney to buy a range of Fox assets for $52 billion, including Sky, which was based on the assumption that Fox would complete its purchase.  Disney\u2019s Bob Iger was in Paris when the news broke. He was quoted in Le Figaro newspaper as saying he had not yet studied Comcast\u2019s provisional offer in detail.  \u201cIt does not compromise our agreement with Fox,\u201d he said in the newspaper report. \u201cIn this agreement, Fox would bring over the 39 percent of the capital of Sky that it already holds, and would, furthermore, make an offer for the rest of Sky\u2019s capital.\u201d  Fox has said it remains committed to its cash offer announced in December 2016.  But investors are now hoping that Fox will make a higher offer or question whether Disney could make its own direct bid for Sky. Shares in Sky were trading at 13.40 pounds on Wednesday, above the 12.50 pounds offered by Comcast.  Fox agreed its deal to buy Sky in December 2016 but it has been forced to go through a comprehensive regulatory review after politicians raised concerns that Murdoch held too much influence in Britain. It agreed to buy Sky at 10.75 pounds per share.","165":"Feb 27 (Reuters) - Sky Plc:  * STATEMENT REGARDING ANNOUNCEMENT BY COMCAST  * SINCE NO FIRM OFFER HAS BEEN MADE AT THIS POINT, SHAREHOLDERS ARE ADVISED TO TAKE NO ACTION  * INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS OF SKY ARE MINDFUL OF THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES AND THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER UK TAKEOVER CODE Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","166":"A federal judge in San Francisco has rejected Comcast Corp\u2019s proposed $7.5 million settlement with cable installation technicians who claim they were deprived of overtime pay, saying the deal could shortchange some of the 4,500 class members.

Peacock, which will also offer classic sitcoms like \u201cThe Office\u201d and \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d, is scheduled to launch in 2020, NBCUniversal said. The company owns traditional television network NBC, whose logo features a peacock.  The service will compete with streaming giant Netflix Inc and Walt Disney Co\u2019s upcoming Disney+ streaming service as well as other digital subscription options, as traditional media companies seek to attract online viewers.  Details on pricing and distribution will be announced closer to launch, the media company said.  Reuters had reported in January that an ad-free version of the NBC service will be available for about the same price as other subscription video services.

FILE PHOTO: The NBC and Comcast logo are displayed on top of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, formerly known as the GE building, in midtown Manhattan in New York July 1, 2015. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Overall revenue missed analyst estimates. Revenue from NBCUniversal\u2019s cable networks, filmed entertainment and theme parks also fell short of expectations in the seasonally weaker quarter.  The Philadelphia-based company\u2019s shares were down 0.7% in early trading.  It beat profit estimates for at least the ninth consecutive quarter.  Comcast is adapting to changes in consumer behavior as more people drop their cable television subscriptions in favor of streaming services like Netflix Inc NFLX.O. It is pursuing higher-margin internet customers rather than unprofitable video subscribers.  \u201cFor years, we\u2019ve felt that video over the internet is more friend than foe,\u201d said Comcast Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts. \u201cWe believe it plays to our strengths.\u201d  Comcast said it lost 224,000 video customers in the quarter, more than the 121,000 it lost in the preceding quarter and topping the loss of 178,000 estimated by analysts, according to research firm FactSet.  \u201cThere is a growing tension between the fortunes of the cable business and NBCU,\u201d said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cThe Cable segment is now benefiting from faster video subscriber losses; remarkably, faster video subscriber losses are now a foundation of the bull case. But there is no way to spin faster video subscriber losses at Cable as anything other than bad news for NBCU.\u201d  Revenue from Comcast\u2019s high-speed internet business grew 9.4% to $4.66 billion in the second quarter as the company gained 209,000 subscribers. The net subscriber additions were slightly ahead of the average analyst estimate of 208,000, according to FactSet, but were down from 260,000 in the same period a year earlier.

The company is planning to launch an advertising-supported TV streaming service in April 2020, which will be free for NBCUniversal\u2019s pay-TV customers as well as Sky customers internationally.  Revenue in Comcast\u2019s filmed entertainment unit fell nearly 15% to $1.46 billion, reflecting a slate of films that underperformed compared to last year\u2019s blockbuster \u201cJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\u201d.

Net income attributable to Comcast fell to $3.13 billion, or 68 cents per share, from $3.22 billion, or 69 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 78 cents per share, beating estimates of 75 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

More than 800 companies last year agreed to a voluntary Federal Communications Commission pledge not to cancel service for people who could not pay because of the coronavirus pandemic.

REUTERS\/Eduardo Munoz\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co DIS.N said on Thursday it was willing to divest Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOXA.O assets that generated up to $1 billion in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to get a regulatory nod for the deal.  Disney in a regulatory filing said it was willing to divest the assets, potentially including regional sports networks. The media conglomerate had previously planned to divest Fox assets that generated $500 million in EBITDA.  Fox has been in the middle of a bidding war between Disney and Comcast Corp CMCSA.O, with Disney on Wednesday raising its bid for the bulk of Fox's film and television assets to $71.3 billion. Comcast is likely to further raise its offer.  Disney and Comcast want to add to their own entertainment businesses with Fox's well-known TV shows and movie franchises, like the \"X-Men\" superheroes and \"The Simpsons,\" to better compete with fast-growing digital rivals Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.  Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger, who has been working with regulators around the world for the past six months, has downplayed antitrust concerns related to the deal.","172":"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. cable giant Comcast Corp CMCSA.O has offered $31 billion for Sky Plc SKYB.L, threatening a plan hatched by Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOXA.O and Walt Disney Co DIS.N to seize control of Europe's biggest pay-TV group.  The world\u2019s biggest entertainment company and owner of NBC and Universal Pictures said on Tuesday it proposed to offer 12.50 pounds per share for Britain\u2019s Sky, more than the 10.75 pounds that Murdoch\u2019s Fox has agreed to pay for it.  Bob Iger\u2019s Disney has agreed to buy Sky from Fox, along with other assets, in a separate $52 billion follow-up deal.  Comcast\u2019s all-cash, unsolicited offer pits CEO Brian Roberts against Murdoch, the 86-year-old tycoon who helped to launch Sky and pioneered pay-TV in Britain. Iger is also a long-time rival after Comcast tried and failed to buy Disney in 2004.  \u201cSky and Comcast are a perfect fit: we are both leaders in creating and distributing content,\u201d Roberts said. Sky\u2019s shares jumped more than 20 percent, closing at 13.31 pounds, indicating that investors expect a bidding war. Shares of Comcast, Fox and Disney fell.  Comcast\u2019s appearance in the already complex Sky drama could prompt Fox to make a higher offer or Disney to make its own direct bid for Sky. Fox remains committed to its cash offer announced in December, it said in a statement.  Media owners have been forced into increasingly aggressive deals after online groups Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O prompted many customers to ditch subscriptions.  Comcast bid $60 billion last year to clinch a deal with Fox, before losing out to Disney.  Sky, which provides sports programming, films and broadband to 23 million homes across Britain, Ireland, Germany, Italy and Austria, urged its investors to take no action since the approach did not represent a firm offer.  Murdoch\u2019s Fox agreed to buy the 61 percent of Sky it did not already own in a cash deal in December 2016, but the takeover has been repeatedly held up by regulators over concerns the media tycoon wields too much influence in Britain.  The shares had been trading above the asking price since Sky this month agreed to pay less than expected for Premier League soccer rights, likely boosting its future earnings and prompting investors to demand a higher offer.  It also attracted the attention of U.S. hedge fund and activist investor Elliott Management Corp, which has built up a 2.5 percent stake in Sky in recent weeks.  Hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, a former son-in-law of Murdoch who holds 1 percent of Sky, said he expected a counter offer and speculated whether Disney could make a direct bid for Sky to avoid Fox\u2019s regulatory problems.  \u201cOnce you\u2019re in a bidding war, it\u2019s not about fair value, it\u2019s about what do you think it\u2019s worth,\u201d Odey added.  \u2018LET BATTLE COMMENCE\u2019  Formed in 1990, Sky has built its business by offering leading content and technology. It snapped up Murdoch\u2019s pay-TV groups across Europe in 2014 to offer a distribution platform that is now proving attractive to the big U.S. content owners.  Comcast said it had not yet engaged with Sky over the proposal and its finance director, Michael Cavanagh, declined to comment on whether it could lead to a renewed bid for Fox. Comcast will have to gain the support of Sky\u2019s independent directors if it does not make a hostile bid because its chairman is Murdoch\u2019s son James, who is also CEO of Fox.  Slideshow ( 11 images )  Comcast\u2019s Roberts, the son of Ralph who founded the company in 1963, called Sky\u2019s Deputy Chairman Martin Gilbert on Tuesday morning to notify him just before the offer statement was released, and called Sky CEO Jeremy Darroch shortly afterwards.  Sky\u2019s independent directors are expected to meet in the coming days to discuss the offer and the company said they were mindful of their duties to investors.  Comcast went public with the proposal to trigger the regulatory timetable because timing will be a key factor.  A Comcast spokesman said it would ask regulators in Brussels to look at the deal where it expects to avoid a lengthy investigation. Britain\u2019s media minister has said he will give his verdict on Fox\u2019s bid for Sky by June 14, giving Comcast a narrow window to get any takeover approval done.  Slideshow ( 11 images )  \u201cWe would like to own the whole of Sky and we will be looking to acquire over 50 percent of the Sky shares,\u201d Roberts said.  Disney\u2019s Iger declined to comment when asked about the Comcast offer during a trip to Paris.  MURDOCH TO LEAD THE CHARGE?  Murdoch had been edging towards a deal for Sky in recent weeks, eight years after he first tried to buy the company.  Britain\u2019s competition regulator said in January his planned takeover should be blocked unless a way was found to prevent the Australian-born power-broker from influencing Sky\u2019s news operation.  Critics, including many politicians, argue Murdoch wields too much influence through the Sun and Times newspapers, and in 2011 he closed the News of the World after its journalists admitted hacking phones to get scoops.  Seeking to prove it would not influence Sky News in the future, Fox last week promised to maintain and fund a fully independent Sky-branded news service for 10 years.  British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s ministers have appeared wary of approving Murdoch\u2019s bid, repeatedly asking the independent regulator to intervene, and Comcast could face a smoother ride.  A spokesman for May said the deal was a commercial matter.  Robey Warshaw, a small boutique firm which has worked on some of Britain's biggest deals, Evercore EVR.N and Bank of America Merrill Lynch BAC.N are advising Comcast.","173":"(Adds details on competition and last year\u2019s opening game)  LOS ANGELES, Sept 11 (Reuters) - The National Football League\u2019s opening night game averaged 20.3 million viewers on Comcast Corp\u2019s NBC television network and online, an 11% drop from last year\u2019s kickoff, according to an estimate from NBC Sports. The audience figure for the Thursday night contest between the Houston Texans and the defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs included people who watched on NBC plus NBC Sports Digital and the NFL\u2019s digital platforms.  The game had competition from National Basketball League and National Hockey League playoffs, which usually wrap up long before the U.S. football season starts. This year, play in those leagues were delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  A deadline for U.S. cable giant Comcast and Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox to declare that their all-cash offers for Sky would not be increased passed on Friday without a move by either side, triggering a rare auction run by Britain\u2019s Takeover Panel.  Fox, which has the backing of partner Walt Disney DIS.N, and Comcast are vying for control of Sky to bolster their businesses in the face of rapid growth of streaming services such as Netflix NFLX.O, which are transforming the media industry.  Saturday\u2019s auction of pay-TV group Sky will last a maximum of three rounds and any bids will be made in private by either telephone or email, a source with knowledge of the process said.  The Takeover Panel then expects to announce the offer prices that the bidders have submitted on Saturday evening.  Sky\u2019s independent directors, who are so far recommending that investors back Comcast\u2019s 14.75 pounds a share offer, which values the broadcaster at 25.9 billion pounds ($34 billion), are expected to meet immediately to decide which offer to back.  Comcast and Fox could end up making the same bids.  Shares in the London-listed pay-TV business closed up 0.3 percent at 15.85 pounds on Friday ahead of what is the climax to two lengthy and interlocking takeover fights for both Fox and Sky that are set to reshape the entertainment sector.  \u201cThis will most likely mark the end of a process that we have managed for almost two years,\u201d Sky Chief Executive Jeremy Darroch wrote in a memo to staff on Thursday.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  (GRAPHIC: Battle for Sky Plc - reut.rs\/2zmdFup)  Fox, which already holds a 39 percent stake in Sky, first offered 10.75 pounds a share for the rest of the broadcaster in December 2016 but saw its takeover delayed by a prolonged regulatory review of the proposed deal in the UK.  The acquisition was then complicated by a separate deal that Disney struck in December 2017 to acquire a host of film and TV assets from Fox, including its Sky stake.  Comcast then gatecrashed both deals, forcing Disney to hike its offer for the Fox assets to about $71 billion in June and Fox to sweeten its bid for Sky to 14 pounds a share in July.  While Comcast responded by immediately boosting its Sky offer to 14.75 pounds a share from 12.50 pounds, it abandoned its attempt to acquire the Fox assets on July 19.  Britain\u2019s Takeover Panel announced the auction on Thursday to end the Sky stand-off and force both Comcast and Fox to disclose their best offers.  Shareholders in the British broadcasting group will have about a fortnight to decide which one to back after the auction finishes.  Fox\u2019s 39 percent shareholding in Sky could become an important factor in determining which suitor ultimately wins control following the auction if the rivals make similar bids.  Fox has set its acceptance threshold for a deal at 75 percent of Sky\u2019s minority shareholders but has the option to lower it and seek a simple majority of all Sky shares, which is Comcast\u2019s target.  Then Fox\u2019s Sky stake would put it in a better position than Comcast to cross the 50 percent threshold.  A Fox victory would result in Disney then taking control of Sky, once it has completed its deal for the Fox assets.","175":"LONDON\/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. media group Comcast CMCSA.O submitted a 22 billion pound($30.7 billion) bid for Sky SKYB.L on Wednesday, prompting the European pay TV group to drop its support for a lower offer from Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA.O.  Sky\u2019s independent directors welcomed Comcast\u2019s 12.50 pound per share bid and said they would now engage with both Comcast and Fox. They cautioned that neither bid could yet be put to shareholders and advised them to take no action for now.  The bid formalizes an offer first made in February and puts pressure on Fox, which already has a 39-percent stake in Sky, to raise the 10.75 pound per share cash offer it first announced in December 2016. It said on Wednesday it remained committed to its offer and was considering its options.  The Fox-Sky deal has been held up by concerns about the influence Murdoch could wield over public opinion through owning all of the broadcaster as well as British newspapers including The Times and The Sun.  The proposed combination has been further complicated by Fox's agreement to sell many of its TV and film assets to Walt Disney Co DIS.N, including its stake in Sky, for $52 billion. Disney did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  On Wednesday, Sky also welcomed commitments the U.S. cable giant had made to address potential public-interest concerns over Sky News, its influential 24-hour news channel.  PJT Partners is advising Sky alongside Barclays and Morgan Stanley.  SKY SHARES RALLY  Comcast Chairman and Chief Executive Brian Roberts said Sky withdrawing its recommendation was what it wanted to achieve by formalizing its offer on Wednesday.  \u201cThe board confirming they are going to focus on the shareholders, that\u2019s the perfect step as far as we are concerned today,\u201d he told reporters.  Sky is chaired by Murdoch\u2019s son James, who played a key role in building the company into a major European broadcaster with operations in Germany, Austria and Italy as well as Britain.  Sky formed a committee of independent directors to consider the bids, given James Murdoch\u2019s role as chief executive of Fox.  The most likely scenario, according to many analysts, is that Fox, with Disney\u2019s blessing, raises its bid. Fox has to at least match Comcast\u2019s offer, but analysts estimate a final winning bid could go as high as 14 to 15 pounds per share.  Sky\u2019s shares rose 3.9 percent on Tuesday, closing at 13.59 pounds, above Comcast\u2019s offer, implying that some shareholders anticipated a bidding war. Comcast shares, which had fallen 14 percent since February, were 3.5 percent higher, while Fox\u2019s rose 2 percent and Disney gained 1.6 percent.  \u201cWe think (Comcast) could reasonably take the offer up to 1300p, but they would be giving away value at anything above that,\u201d New Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin said.  Morningstar analyst Allan Nichols said Comcast\u2019s offer fully valued Sky, and any increase would be negative for Comcast, Disney or Fox shareholders. That would likely keep a lid on a bidding war, he wrote in a research note.  \u2018UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY\u2019  FILE PHOTO: A woman walks past the NBC and Comcast logos on 30 Rockefeller Plaza in midtown Manhattan in New York, U.S., February 27, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  Hedge fund Elliott has taken a stake of almost 3 percent in Sky, according to its latest filing, and other shareholders have also argued that Disney\u2019s agreement to buy Fox implies a higher value for Sky.  Little known in Europe, Philadelphia-based Comcast is the biggest U.S. cable operator, owning broadcasters NBC, CNBC and MSNBC. It also owns movie studio Universal Pictures, home to \u201cMinions\u201d and \u201cJason Bourne\u201d movies and some theme parks.  It said it had formalized its offer to coincide with its own results, giving it an opportunity to explain to investors the merits of the bid.  Its quarterly earnings topped Wall Street expectations on Wednesday.  Roberts said Comcast had been built through bold investments since it was founded by his father in 1963.  \u201cWhen you see opportunities that won\u2019t come around again - unique opportunities - you have to consider that with extra focus,\u201d he said. \u201cSky will be our platform for growth across Europe.\u201d  He said Comcast was continuing to work with the European Commission on the regulatory process, and he did not believe a British investigation would be required.  \u201cWe believe in the importance of news and the integrity that underpins it (and) we have a proven track record of stewardship and investment,\u201d he said.  Comcast said it had secured a bridge loan of up to 16 billion pounds and a term loan credit agreement of up to 7 billion pounds to fund the deal. ($1 = 0.7160 pounds)","176":"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp CMCSA.O dropped its $66 billion bid for Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's FOXA.O entertainment assets on Thursday but said it would still try to expand its international footprint by acquiring 61 percent of European broadcaster Sky Plc SKYB.L, the remainder of which is owned by Fox.  Comcast's withdrawal is a concession to Walt Disney Co DIS.N, which last month sweetened its offer for the Fox assets to $71.3 billion, in a bid to unite two storied Hollywood studios and several television networks under one corporate umbrella.  Comcast\u2019s move de-escalates one of the media industry\u2019s most high-profile confrontations, which pitted Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts against Fox Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch and Disney CEO Bob Iger. However, it still leaves the two companies competing to expand in Europe via a bidding war for Sky, which is 39-percent owned by Fox.  Fox has also made an offer for the 61 percent of Sky it does not own, although Comcast is currently the highest bidder with a 14.75 pounds-per share-offer, worth $34 billion, for the London-listed pay TV group.  Shares of Comcast, the largest U.S. cable company, rose 2.7 percent as investors were relieved the company did not try to outbid Disney further. Disney shares were up 1.6 percent.  Fox shares fell 1.2 percent and Sky ended down 1.5 percent. One of the reasons Comcast dropped its bid for the Fox assets was that the bidding war was inflating the value of Sky, given its partial ownership by Fox, according to sources familiar with the company\u2019s thinking.  \u201cWalking away from the battle for Fox at this price we think supports the view that (Comcast is) fine without it,\u201d said Jonathan Chaplin, analyst at New Street Research. \u201cIt remains to be seen how Sky wraps up, but we think it is highly unlikely that they would bid up to a price that would suggest desperation.\u201d  In a regulatory filing last week, Fox and Disney acknowledged for the first time they may not try to again outbid Comcast on Sky, though the sources stressed no decision has been taken.  Bernstein analysts have said Disney\u2019s debt pile could now hamper its ability to take on Comcast with a new bid for Sky, partly because it will need to invest even more to launch a successful direct-to-consumer streaming platform.  Disney and Fox did not immediately reply to requests for comment. On CNBC, Disney\u2019s Iger said he was \u201cextremely pleased with today\u2019s news.\u201d Fox and Disney shareholders will vote on their deal next week.  Comcast dropped its bid for the Fox assets because it was concerned the price was becoming too high, even though its banks were ready to finance a new bid, according to the sources. It was also worried how much revenue it would lose in divesting assets to appease U.S. antitrust regulators.  \u201cI\u2019d like to congratulate Bob Iger and the team at Disney and commend the Murdoch family and Fox for creating such a desirable and respected company,\u201d Comcast\u2019s Roberts said in a statement on Thursday.  Disney owns ABC, ESPN, Pixar, Marvel Studios and \u201cStar Wars\u201d producer Lucasfilm, plus an array of theme parks. The Fox assets being acquired include a cable group with FX Networks, National Geographic and 300-plus international channels, plus Fox\u2019s stake in Hulu.

SKY\u2019S THE LIMIT  The bidding between Comcast and Disney is part of a bigger battle in the entertainment industry as media giants splash out tens of billions of dollars on deals to be able to compete with Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  While an acquisition of Britain\u2019s Sky, a broadcaster of sports, films and TV shows to 23 million homes across Europe, would significantly diversify Comcast\u2019s business overseas, it would do little to give it scale in its core U.S. market.  \u201cOur view is that probably there is less chance of Fox\/Disney coming back with an increased offer for Sky given that Comcast would have more available firepower,\u201d said Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker.  Nevertheless, Sky shares ended trading at 15.09 pounds on Thursday, above Comcast\u2019s 14.75-pound-per-share offer, as investors continued to bet on a better deal. \u201cI don\u2019t think Disney wants to give up Sky,\u201d said Crispin Odey, whose eponymous hedge fund owns Sky shares.  Comcast was drawn into a bidding war for Fox because of the scarcity of big media assets up for sale, given that the industry is dominated by powerful families and personalities reluctant to cede control. CBS Corp CBS.N and Viacom Inc VIAB.O, for example, are tightly controlled by the Redstone family.  However, smaller media companies could become acquisition targets. Lions Gate Entertainment Corp LGFa.N rose 5.2 percent on investor speculation it could become an acquisition target. Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc and MGM Studios Inc are also seen as potential targets.  Comcast first made an offer for the Fox entertainment assets last November, but Fox decided to go with Disney, even if its bid was lower, because it believed a deal with Comcast would not win antitrust approval. The U.S. Department of Justice last month approved Disney\u2019s deal with Fox.","177":"Slideshow ( 3 images )  (Reuters) - Comcast Corp\u2019s Universal Studios Orlando theme park will reopen to the public at reduced capacity on June 5, the company said on Thursday.

Sky added 38,000 customers, taking its customer base to nearly 23 million homes.  Core earnings for the nine months to end-March were up 10 percent to 1.7 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) on like-for-like revenue up 5 percent to 10.1 billion pounds.  The latest battle to buy Sky started in December 2016, when Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA.O, the owner of 39 percent of the company, agreed to buy the rest.  Since then, the deal has been stuck in regulatory purgatory, a tortuous process due to end in June.  But if Fox receives clearance it is unlikely to end up as the long-term owner of Sky.  Murdoch agreed to sell most of Fox to Disney DIS.N for $52.4 billion in December, including its stake in Sky.  Fox spurned a higher offer from U.S. cable giant Comcast CMCSA.O over concerns about regulatory risk and its stock value, a filing showed on Wednesday.  After losing that battle, Comcast said it was considering making a 12.50 pounds a share offer for Sky, valuing the group at $31 billion, and trumping the 10.75 pounds offer agreed by Fox.  Darroch said on Thursday there had been some interaction between Sky and Comcast in terms of the regulatory process.  \u201cThey haven\u2019t yet come forward with a full offer, as and when they do that, if they do, then we will obviously come back and talk a bit more in detail then,\u201d he told reporters.  Fox\/Disney and Comcast want to buy Sky to scale up against online groups Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.  Darroch said Sky was continuing to improve its own products and services to ensure it provided the content entertainment its customers wanted.  It will launch streaming service Spotify SPOT.N on its flagship Sky Q platform next week, and will offer Netflix NFLX.O in a Sky package in Britain before the end of the year, he said.  \u201cCustomers can look forward to an even broader choice of entertainment through our pioneering new partnerships with Netflix and Spotify, together with our new Premier League deal which secures the UK rights until 2022,\u201d he said.

Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice gave the go-ahead to Disney\u2019s acquisition of the Fox assets, asking Disney, which owns sports network ESPN, to divest all of Fox\u2019s 22 regional sports networks, known as RSNs, on antitrust grounds. These networks could be worth as much as $20 billion, according to the sources.  Comcast, which made a $65 billion all-cash offer for the Fox assets last month only for Disney to raise its bid, is talking to private equity firms, including Apollo Global Management LLC APO.N and Blackstone Group LP BX.N, to gauge interest about acquiring the RSNs, the sources said. It is possible that a telecommunications or media company might also express interest in purchasing the RSNs, the sources added.  Comcast believes finding such partners will not only allow it to argue that it can win antitrust approval for the Fox assets as easily as Disney, but will also boost its finances as its prepares to make a second all-cash offer later this month, the sources said.  Fox shareholders are scheduled to vote on the Disney deal on July 27. Comcast is planning to make its bid before then, according to the sources.  Comcast is open to negotiating with regulators the number of RSNs it would have to divest, though it believes only eight Fox RSNs would overlap with Comcast\u2019s sports footprint, according to the sources.  The terms of Comcast\u2019s upcoming new offer could not be learned. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Comcast and Fox did not respond to requests for comment. Disney, Apollo and Blackstone declined to comment.  The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Comcast was exploring tie-ups with other companies or private equity investors for its bid for the Fox assets.  Comcast has been stocking up on live sports content, which is popular with advertisers because large audiences watch the events in real time without being able to skip the commercials. Its NBCUniversal unit carries coverage of the Olympic Games exclusively in the United States.  Comcast is also competing against Disney to acquire control of European broadcaster Sky Plc SKYB.L, in which Fox already owns a 39 percent stake.

Demand for ultrafast home connections is expected to rise in the coming months, as many people are expected to continue working from home.  \u201cWe have been forced home, putting the Italian telecoms infrastructure under great stress,\u201d said Ibarra, a former top executive at Dutch telecoms operator KPN.  SKY has invested 230 million euros ($261 million) to launch its broadband service in Italy, he said.  SKY will provide the service using the fiber-optic infrastructure of wholesale broadband firm Open Fiber, jointly owned by Italian utility Enel and state lender CDP.  SKY\u2019s service will start in 26 cities this month and will extend to 120 during the summer.  Ibarra said it would be extended further as Open Fiber\u2019s coverage expanded. In the meantime, SKY has signed a deal with Swisscom\u2019s Fastweb to reach clients in areas not currently covered by Open Fiber.  SKY\u2019s entrance in the broadband business will add pressure on former state phone monopoly Telecom Italia, which has steadily lost market share in the fixed-line segment.  The content services offered by SKY, which has 5.2 million customers, are facing increasing competition from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.","182":"FILE PHOTO: The Sky logo is seen on outside of an entrance to offices and studios in west London, Britain June 29, 2017.

Comedian and producer Byron Allen leaves the Supreme Court after it heard Comcast's bid to evade a civil rights lawsuit he filed against the company, in Washington, U.S. November 13, 2019. REUTERS\/Lawrence Hurley  Over the course of an hour of oral arguments, however, the justices struggled over whether a lower court that cleared the way for the $20 billion lawsuit against Comcast to proceed had reviewed the case under the proper legal standard.  Their ruling, due by the end of June, could impact the ability of plaintiffs to enforce claims under the Civil Rights Act of 1866, a post-Civil War law that forbids racial discrimination in business contracts.  At issue in the litigation is the refusal by Comcast to carry channels operated by Entertainment Studios Networks, owned by Byron Allen, who is black.  The case centers on whether a lawsuit like Allen\u2019s can proceed to trial without showing that racial discrimination was the predominant cause of the denial.  The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year said lawsuits may go ahead if plaintiffs can show that discriminatory intent was one factor among others in the denial of a contract.  During Wednesday\u2019s arguments, several justices raised doubts that the standard to sustain a lawsuit should be as stringent as Comcast suggests.  Chief Justice John Roberts wondered why, if \u201cclear racial animus\u201d occurred at one step of a failed contract negotiation, it would not be reasonable to allege in a lawsuit that the discrimination carried through to the end.  Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted that such discrimination lawsuits are rarely thrown out at an early stage of litigation.  Both liberal and conservative justices, however, raised questions indicating that the appeals court decision siding with Allen may have to be set aside and reconsidered in light of their eventual ruling.  Entertainment Studios Networks sued in Los Angeles federal court, accusing certain cable companies including Comcast and Charter Communications Inc of violating the civil rights law.  Comcast and Charter said their business decisions were based on capacity constraints, not race, and that Allen\u2019s channels, including JusticeCentral.TV, Cars.TV, and Comedy.TV, did not show sufficient promise or customer demand to merit distribution.  Other distributors, including Verizon Communications Inc , AT&T Inc and DirecTV, carry some of Allen\u2019s programming, court papers said.  Allen pinned the rejections primarily on racial discrimination, accusing cable executives of giving insincere or invalid excuses and granting contracts to carry white-owned networks during the same period.  The Trump administration backed Comcast in the case.","185":"LONDON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - A proposal by U.S. cable giant Comcast to buy Sky is a commercial matter for the companies, a spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Tuesday.

As the streaming wars heat up, TV viewers are watching video content online, through internet-connected TVs and even on social media apps, posing a challenge for advertisers, which often have to work with multiple different advertising tech tools or sales teams to buy ads and then manually compare how many people saw the ads.  The media company within cable TV provider Comcast is now launching the consolidated tech system, called One Platform, to make it easier for advertisers to purchase ads across the different places where NBCUniversal content is shown, such as its cable channels and new streaming service Peacock.  NBCUniversal said advertisers will be able to target viewers based on age and gender, the traditional metrics by which TV commercials are sold, across TV, digital and streaming by using One Platform.  They will also be able to target viewers in more advanced ways, such as based on their interests and the types of content they watch.  The new capabilities for advertisers with One Platform come a few months before the annual upfronts, a crucial advertising period in May when advertisers buy commercials in advance for the upcoming TV season.  NBCUniversal said it will also expand its CFlight measurement system to include out-of-home advertising like billboards and short-form videos.

Peacock, a nod to NBC\u2019s logo, will be free for Comcast customers and be available to other customers for a tiered monthly fee - the details of which will be announced on Thursday.  Of the existing streaming services, only Hulu is ad-supported, although an ad-supported version of HBO Max is expected in 2021.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Comcast outbid Fox in an auction to take control of pay-TV group Sky on Saturday, with a $40 billion offer price. That price includes Fox\u2019s 39 percent stake, which the offer valued at 11.63 billion pounds ($15.31 billion).  Walt Disney Co DIS.N, which agreed to buy Fox in June for $71.3 billion, said it had given consent to Fox's decision. Disney shares rose 1.8 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $115.87 in midday trade.  Fox\u2019s sale hands full control of the satellite TV company to Comcast Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts, giving the U.S. cable company a global footprint of 53 million customers.  It also allows Disney to focus its resources on building direct-to-consumer products such as the Disney-branded streaming video service that is expected to launch late next year, the company said.  \u201cWhen we launched Sky in 1989 it was four channels produced from a prefab structure in an industrial park on the fringes of west London,\u201d Fox said in a statement. \u201cWe bet -- and almost lost -- the farm on launching a business that many didn\u2019t think was such a good idea.\u201d  Fox had previously agreed to sell the stake in Sky to Disney as part of Disney\u2019s acquisition of Fox.

FILE PHOTO: The Comcast NBC logo is shown on a building in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 13, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The company\u2019s shares were up 3 percent in morning trading after falling as much as 3 percent premarket following the earnings release.  Chief Executive Brian Roberts said the company, which purchased British pay-TV group Sky last year, is exploring the launch of a global NBC-Sky news network, but did not give any details.  Overall revenue missed analyst estimates and Comcast lost more video and phone customers than expected. Revenue from its NBCUniversal cable networks, filmed entertainment and theme parks also fell short of expectations.  Earnings per share, led by the strongest profit growth in its cable division in a decade, still exceeded expectations.  Like others in the cable television industry, Comcast is grappling with competition from Alphabet Inc\u2019s YouTube TV and subscription video services like Netflix Inc.  Earlier this week AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc both reported losing more video customers than analysts expected.  Philadelphia-based Comcast said it lost 121,000 video customers in the quarter, more than the 29,000 it shed last quarter and the 109,000 estimated by analysts, according to research firm FactSet. In response, the company is striving to build new services on top of its broadband network.  But recent price increases from AT&T and YouTube TV could be good for traditional pay-TV companies.  \u201cThere was a bit of excitement as everybody rushed into the business over the last year or so, and that excitement now is going away,\u201d Steve Burke, CEO of NBCUniversal, said of tech companies\u2019 incursion into the pay-TV business.  Revenue from the high-speed internet business climbed 10 percent to $4.58 billion in the first quarter as the company added 375,000 subscribers on a net basis.  Subscriber additions beat the average analyst estimate of 356,000, according to FactSet, but were down slightly from 379,000 in the same period a year earlier.  Comcast is betting that its redesigned Xfinity X1 cable box, which uses a single menu to find content across live TV, on-demand and streaming services like Netflix, will help retain and attract subscribers confused over how to navigate myriad new digital TV offerings.  Revenue at its NBCUniversal business, which includes NBC Entertainment and Universal Pictures, dropped 12.5 percent to $8.31 billion.  NBCUniversal plans to launch an advertising-supported TV streaming service in 2020 that will be free for NBCUniversal\u2019s pay-TV customers as well as Sky customers internationally.  Filmed entertainment revenue rose 7.4 percent to $1.77 billion, boosted by movies including \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World\u201d and \u201cUs\u201d while theme park revenue slipped 0.4 percent to $1.28 billion.  Revenue from broadcast television dropped 29.4 percent year-on-year to $2.47 billion. Excluding last year\u2019s Olympics and Super Bowl from the prior-year comparison, however, revenue rose.  Sky revenue fell 5 percent to $5 billion. On a constant-currency basis, revenue rose by nearly 2 percent.  Comcast\u2019s overall revenue rose 18 percent to $26.86 billion, but fell short of Wall Street expectations of $27.20 billion.  Excluding items, the company earned 76 cents per share, beating estimates of 68 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.","214":"LONDON (Reuters) - Sky SKYB.L shares jumped 9 percent on Monday to within touching distance of what Comcast CMCSA.O will pay to buy Europe's biggest pay-TV group after seeing off competition from Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA.O.  The U.S. cable-TV giant offered $40 billion in a rare weekend auction that brought to an end its battle against Rupert Murdoch's Fox and Walt Disney Co DIS.N, which would have been Sky's ultimate owner if Murdoch had succeeded.  However, concerns about the premium Comcast had paid were reflected on the stock market in New York where Comcast\u2019s shares lost more than 6 percent.  Analysts at MoffettNathanson downgraded Comcast from \u201cbuy\u201d to \u201cneutral\u201d and Oppenheimer downgraded from \u201coutperform\u201d to \u201cperform\u201d. Fox shares, in contrast, were up 0.6 percent and Disney gained 1.7 percent.  Both Comcast and Fox\/Disney had wanted control of Sky to increase their reach in Europe, where pay-TV is growing, and to gain access to Sky\u2019s 23 million customers which would bolster their defense against streaming services from Netflix and Amazon.  The prize was valued far higher by Comcast in the third and final round of the auction when it bid 17.28 pounds while Fox offered only 15.67 pounds, below the level at which Sky shares were trading on Friday. Sky shares stood at 1721.5 pence at 1350 GMT on Monday.  Comcast, which owns the NBC network and Universal Pictures, swiftly received the backing of Sky\u2019s independent directors.  Comcast is paying a high price - more than double Sky\u2019s share price before Fox made its initial approach in December 2016 when it offered 10.75 pounds per share.  One senior analyst at a London-based hedge fund firm said it was an \u201cincredible outcome\u201d.  FILE PHOTO: Sky Sports logos at the company's UK headquarters in West London, July 25, 2014. REUTERS\/Toby Melville\/File Photo  \u201cNot only the absolute number but also the gap between both offers, which could lead to Fox\/Disney selling their stake (or part of it at the very least), thereby de-risking the Comcast offer which is conditional to the more than 50 percent acceptance condition,\u201d he said.  Research firm MoffettNathanson said it feared Sky would be an albatross to Comcast.  \u201cComcast would like to have investors view Sky as a platform-agnostic collection of proprietary programming agreements that can serve as a springboard to create a global OTT (over-the-top) provider, and, to be fair, the company does indeed have many proprietary programming agreements,\u201d it said.  \u201cBut it seems as though they would like investors to forget that it is also a satellite TV provider, and satellite video distribution is increasingly becoming obsolete.\u201d  FOX HOLDING  The big hurdle to Comcast\u2019s ambitions is the 39 percent of Sky that Fox owns, and which it has agreed to sell to Disney in a separate wider $71 billion deal.  Fox\u2019s holding, which Comcast\u2019s offer values at more than $15 billion, stems from Murdoch\u2019s role in the creation of the company as a pioneer in British pay television nearly three decades ago.  Fox\/Disney have not said whether they will accept Comcast\u2019s offer. Without that holding, Comcast will need about 82 percent of the remaining shares for its bid to cross the threshold for acceptances.  Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada said if Fox\/Disney do not tender their shares Comcast would be unable to de-list Sky or squeeze them out.  \u201cThis could be used as leverage by Disney in return for distribution rights, or as part of any future asset swap,\u201d they said on Monday.  Sky operates in European markets such as Britain, Ireland, Germany and Italy. The deal also gives Comcast an immediate beachhead in online video streaming with its Now TV business, which has about 2 million customers.  Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts has praised Sky\u2019s technology after quietly testing it on a private visit to a shopping center on a previous trip to London.  Analysts see Comcast super-charging Now TV to combat Netflix across the globe. And Sky\u2019s relationships to distribute HBO entertainment content and Premier League soccer further insulate Comcast over the next few years.  The deal with Disney will leave Fox to focus on assets such as Fox News Channel and its broadcast of sports such as National Football League and Major League Baseball.","215":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starting in January, most seasons of popular workplace comedy \u201cThe Office\u201d will be accessible only with a monthly subscription to Comcast Corp\u2019s Peacock Premium streaming service, the company announced on Monday.

CNBC reported on Monday, citing sources, that Comcast was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d to make a new offer for the Fox assets. However, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Comcast CEO Brian Roberts has kept his arrangements with banks in place to make a new offer, but he has not communicated his intentions or made a final decision.  Comcast would not be required to make a new announcement about walking away from the main Fox assets, according to the sources, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. It would be very difficult for Comcast to press on a new bid if it did not come this week, according to the sources.  Fox declined to comment. Comcast and Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  A new bid from Comcast for the Fox assets, which include its movie studio and several TV networks, would stretch the cable operator's finances, given that it has also offered $34 billion to acquire 61 percent of European broadcaster Sky Plc SKYB.L. Fox, which owns 39 percent of Sky, has been also seeking to acquire the majority stake.  Comcast has also been seeking to convince Fox and investors that regulators would approve its bid for the main Fox assets after U.S. Department of Justice gave the green light to Disney's bid for them. However, the Justice Department's decision last week to appeal against the loss of its challenge to AT&T Inc's T.N takeover of Time Warner Inc served as a reminder that risks persist of antitrust measures.  Walking away from the main Fox assets would give Comcast less negotiating leverage with Disney and Fox to end the bidding war for Sky. Several analysts have suggested that the two bidding wars for the main Fox assets and Sky could have been resolved with some kind of grand bargain between Comcast and Disney.  The fight between Disney and Comcast has been part of a bigger battle being waged in the entertainment industry as the growth of Netflix NFLX.O and Amazon AMZN.O force the world's traditional media giants to spend tens of billions of dollars to keep pace.","228":"FILE PHOTO: Vice Chairman of Universal Parks & Resorts and President of Universal Creative Mark Woodbury, President and COO of Universal Studios Hollywood Karen Irwin, Vice Chairman of NBCUniversal Ron Meyer, Chairman and CEO of Universal Parks & Resorts Tom Williams, Producer Frank Marshall, Director Colin Trevorrow, Actors Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt and the velociraptor character named Blue pose at the \"Jurassic World - The Ride\" grand opening celebration at Universal Studios Hollywood theme park in Universal City, California, U.S., July 22, 2019.

The ability to determine whether an ad shown on TV or streaming services directly led to product sales has long been a technological challenge for media companies. The new tool from Sky, a unit of Comcast Corp, to now provide this capability will help brands make the most of the money they spend on advertising, Sky said.  \u201cThere has never been more focus on this objective than in the last four months given the uncertain world we are living in,\u201d said Dev Sangani, director of strategy and capability for Sky Media, the ad sales division of Sky.  Global ad revenue for traditional TV is expected to shrink 12% this year due to the postponement of major sports events, according to a report last month from media intelligence firm MAGNA Global.  Sky and TVSquared said the partnership will let Sky\u2019s advertisers track in real-time whether their traditional TV and streaming video ads are attracting consumers\u2019 interest and therefore leading to more traffic on their websites. Previously, advertisers might wait weeks to see reports about how their commercials performed, said Calum Smeaton, chief executive of TVSquared.  TVSquared will analyze ads by using its access to advertisers\u2019 web traffic data and pairing it with Sky\u2019s TV viewing data, Smeaton said.  Early data from the new measurement tool showed TV ads are more effective at getting customers to visit advertisers\u2019 websites than previously thought, the companies said.","230":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Comcast Corp CMCSA.O on Wednesday raised its offer for Britain's Sky SKYB.L in a deal valuing the pay-TV group at $34 billion, challenging a raised bid from Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA.O.

FILE PHOTO: The NBC and Comcast logos are displayed on 30 Rockefeller Plaza in midtown Manhattan in New York, U.S., February 27, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  Behind the closed doors of a congressional task force last month, Comcast\u2019s video ads division FreeWheel accused Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google of using privacy concerns as a pretext to limit FreeWheel\u2019s ability to sell ads on behalf of its clients\u2019 YouTube channels, four people briefed on the discussion said.  Comcast may be drawing a line in the sand and wants to avoid letting Google do to the video ad business what it has done to the online ad market.  It is the first time one of the most powerful companies in the United States, with its own muscular lobbying apparatus in Washington, is taking sides in the antitrust battle looming over the world\u2019s largest seller of online ads. Google\u2019s competitors are warning lawmakers that emerging privacy regulations could help Google extend its dominance.  \u201cFreeWheel would embrace a solution that allowed it to continue to meaningfully serve its clients when they publish their content on YouTube, as it had for over a decade on that platform,\u201d Comcast said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, the actions to remove or degrade FreeWheel\u2019s capabilities on YouTube fall well short of that.\u201d  Comcast\u2019s concerns have not prompted a full-on attack on Google, though Comcast has contacted other technology companies to discuss the threat posed by Google, two other sources said.  The issues raised by Comcast and its subsidiary have been echoed widely in the cable and ad technology industries. Most companies that contend Google has unfairly squeezed them out have been reticent to speak out because they rely on Google services and fear retaliation.  But Comcast, which owns media company NBC, Universal Pictures and the Xfinity internet service, is a large spender on state and federal lobbying and election campaigns and a veteran of political organizing.  The House Judiciary Committee, U.S. Department of Justice and a coalition of 50 state-level attorneys general have each asked Google for information about its ads business in recent weeks as they begin investigating potential violations of antitrust law.  Google declined to comment on Comcast\u2019s recent actions but has said it is cooperating with the investigations and that it faces robust competition in advertising, including from Comcast.  PRIVACY PUSH  FreeWheel\u2019s tensions with Google stem from a one-of-a-kind agreement struck in 2009 as YouTube sought to burnish its image with clips from well-known TV channels.  The deal enables media companies such as NBC, Turner, now owned by AT&T Inc, and Viacom Inc to sell ads alongside their content on YouTube using FreeWheel\u2019s technology rather than Google\u2019s competing tool, ensuring access to their single, preferred system across various streaming websites and apps.  FreeWheel is the go-to video ad server because of its experience, said a FreeWheel client, speaking on the condition of anonymity.  But last year, Google closed FreeWheel\u2019s pipe into YouTube in Europe, citing the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation that imposed new requirements on companies seeking to share consumer data.  In the United States, Google has allowed FreeWheel\u2019s continued use on the condition that starting with tests this month, the tens of media companies reliant on it will be cut off from accessing some user data for privacy reasons, one of the sources said. The data reduction could make FreeWheel\u2019s system less attractive to media companies and their advertisers, potentially prompting a shift to Google, the source said.  Google said a small percentage of YouTube revenue is affected and that it has been working with FreeWheel to restore access in Europe and preserve it in the United States.  A FreeWheel representative brought up the issue at a private hearing in September of the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s Tech Task Force, led by Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn, the sources briefed on the discussion said.  Blackburn, who is holding hearings to inform potential privacy laws, said on C-SPAN last week that a Congressional privacy bill being weighed must preserve competition better than EU regulations have. Her spokeswoman declined to comment on FreeWheel\u2019s task force comments.  INTERNET TRACKING  The conflict is playing out on another front. Google said last month it is experimenting with encrypting the internet traffic of Chrome users, and Android has similar capability in its newest version.  The move, technically known as DNS-over-HTTPS, increases users\u2019 privacy and security by limiting some companies, including internet service providers, from tracking users\u2019 browsing.  Internet experts say Google adopting the new technology widely and stringently would cripple tools for parental controls and stifling child pornography online. Trade associations for cable and wireless companies including Comcast told Congress last month that the move could \u201cpossibly foreclose competition in advertising and other industries.\u201d  Comcast told Reuters that it was open to working with Google on the issue in way that ensures various security and parental controls are not broken, but that \u201cany unilateral action that limits customer choice will not work.\u201d  Google spokesman Scott Westover said its proposal maintains \u201call existing filters and controls\u201d and that \u201cany claim that we are trying to become the centralized encrypted DNS provider is inaccurate.\u201d","235":"FILE PHOTO - The Walmart logo is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., May 1, 2018.

While TV is still the best way to reach large numbers of people at one time, it has lacked the targeting, data and measurement that digital platforms like Facebook offer advertisers, said Marcien Jenckes, president of advertising for Comcast Cable.  \u201cTV is often looked at as the lowest common denominator medium (in advertising), and unless addressability is achieved at scale, we\u2019re going to fall short,\u201d he said in an interview.  Comcast has worked with TV networks Fox, Viacom and A+E, as well as NBCUniversal in the past to develop addressable advertising, Jenckes said.

Xandr and Comcast-owned advertising technology company FreeWheel are both part of Project OAR, a consortium of companies that is trying to standardize addressable advertising.

Comcast, the world\u2019s biggest entertainment company, is asking investment banks to increase a bridge financing facility by as much as $60 billion so it can make an offer for Fox\u2019s media assets, three people familiar with the matter said on Monday.  Disney in December had offered to buy film, television and international businesses from Fox for $52.4 billion in stock to beef up its offering against streaming rivals Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc.  A handful of notes from Wall Street analysts said Comcast\u2019s involvement was likely to push Disney to raise its existing offer.  Disney shares fell 1 percent in morning trade in New York, while Comcast\u2019s dipped 3.5 percent to $31.25.  \u201cIt is reasonable to expect Disney to counter any potential offer while also changing the composition of its current all-stock offer,\u201d Jefferies analyst Scott Goldman said.  \u201cComcast and Disney are likely to view this as the last remaining transformational deal in media.\u201d  He also pointed to the huge increase in Comcast\u2019s debt the acquisition of both Fox and British pay-TV group Sky for almost $100 billion in total would generate.  \u201cInvestors have considered such a move ever since Comcast inserted itself in the race for control of Sky,\u201d Jefferies\u2019 Goldman said.  \u201cHowever, investors likely have not contemplated an all-cash bid, which would take pro forma leverage to around 4.5 times, including synergies, intensifying the balance sheet debate.\u201d  Comcast stepped up its push to buy UK-based Sky on Tuesday, keen to prove that it will face fewer regulatory hurdles in its $31 billion pursuit of Sky compared to Fox.  Fox is in the final stages of a bid to buy the 61 percent of the UK broadcaster it does not already own but at 10.75 pounds a share compared with Comcast\u2019s 12.50 pounds has so far made the lower offer.  Shares of Fox were last up 2.2 percent at $38.86.  \u201cAssuming Fox continues to pursue a deal with Disney, Fox will need to raise its bid for Sky from its current level ... in order to win control,\u201d UBS analysts wrote in a note to clients.

Slideshow ( 8 images )  A firm offer from Comcast, widely expected later in the day, could upend Fox\u2019s $52 billion all-stock deal to be bought by Walt Disney Co.  U.S. District Judge Richard Leon on Tuesday approved AT&T\u2019s buyout of Time Warner, rebuffing an attempt by U.S. President Donald Trump to block the takeover and potentially clearing the path for more such deals in a rapidly changing media industry.  Fox shares rose 7 percent in afternoon trade. Shares of other telecom and media companies such as Sprint Corp, CBS Corp and Discovery Inc were all up between 1 percent to 3 percent. Time Warner rose almost 3 percent, while Disney was up 2 percent.  While the judge\u2019s approval of AT&T\u2019s deal for Time Warner may embolden Comcast, it does not guarantee clear passage for its acquisition of Fox\u2019s entertainment business, according to antitrust lawyers.  Henry Su, an antitrust expert with Constantine Cannon LLP, said that Comcast already owns significant amounts of content because it bought NBC Universal.  Both companies operate television and film studios, have a stake in streaming service Hulu and own regional sports networks.  Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson, said Judge Leon\u2019s opinion will be seen as a green light for Comcast to bid for Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox, but tipped Disney as the potential winner in a bidding war.  \u201cWe continue to believe that Disney has the superior balance sheet, cost of debt, equity and rationale to emerge victorious over Comcast in a bidding war,\u201d Moffett said.  Comcast said in May it was in advanced stages of preparing a higher all-cash offer for Fox\u2019s assets but did not indicate the value of its bid. Reuters reported last November that both Comcast and Verizon Communications Inc had expressed interest in buying Fox\u2019s assets.  The move by media companies to consolidate highlights the threat from online players such as Netflix Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, which sell content online directly to consumers, without requiring a pricey cable subscription.  AT&T\u2019s stock, however, was down 5 percent, with analysts raising concerns about the debt the company would absorb. Research firm MoffettNathanson said AT&T will carry $249 billion of debt after the merger.  Cowen and Co analyst Gregory Williams played down the drop in AT&T\u2019s stock price.  \u201cOnce technically driven volatility wears off we expect the stock to move higher as closure will likely provide a new investor catalyst including about $1.5 billion in anticipated cost synergies,\u201d Williams said.","247":"The NBC and Comcast logos are displayed on 30 Rockefeller Plaza in midtown Manhattan in New York, U.S., February 27, 2018.

The biggest U.S. cable provider\u2019s main TV business is under pressure as more viewers look to \u201ccut the cord\u201d in favor of cheaper streaming services like Alphabet Inc\u2019s YouTube and Netflix Inc, but it added 273,000 customers overall in the fiscal first quarter.

Total capital expenditures were $1.97 billion during the quarter, down 5 percent from last year.  On an adjusted basis, earnings per share were 62 cents per share, beating analyst estimates of 59 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters data. It was not immediately clear if the figures were fully comparable.  Comcast lost 96,000 video subscribers in the quarter ended March 31, compared with an addition of 42,000 customers last year. Analysts from MoffettNathanson, UBS and Macquarie had expected losses of about 75,000 video customers.  But the company added 379,000 high-speed internet customers during the quarter, compared with estimates of about 365,000, and average earnings per customer relationship ticked up 0.9 percent to $152.83.  NBCUniversal\u2019s revenue rose by 21 percent from last year, driven by the airing of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and the U.S. Super Bowl.

Other media company shares were also down.  \u201cWith the rate adjustments that we are implementing in 2020 as well as the ongoing changes in consumer behavior, we expect higher video subscriber losses this year,\u201d said Chief Financial Officer Michael Cavanagh.  Pay TV companies have been raising rates instead of trying to hang on to bargain-chasers who are cutting cable service. In the fourth quarter Comcast lost 149,000 video customers, more than a loss of 139,000 estimated by research firm FactSet, but fewer than the 238,000 video customers it lost in the third quarter.  The company has been vocal about its effort to chase broadband customers to offset cord-cutting, as viewers who stream TV and film require a broadband connection to do so.  It gained 442,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of 378,000 net additions, according to FactSet. Revenue from that business grew 8.8% to $4.79 billion.  Comcast will enter the streaming video war on April 15, when it launches its advertising-supported Peacock streaming service to Comcast customers, followed by a launch across the United States on July 15.  The company reported fourth-quarter revenue of $28.4 billion, beating the Wall Street consensus estimate of $28.17 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Revenue growth was aided by British pay-TV group Sky, which the company acquired for $39 billion in 2018. The business generated fourth-quarter revenue of $5.04 billion, beating the average estimate of $4.82 billion.  For the fourth quarter Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal segment, which includes NBC Entertainment and Universal Pictures, reported revenue of $9.15 billion, down 2.6% from a year earlier.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The joint filing by Disney and Fox, which outlines the timeline of their negotiations, offers the most detailed insight yet into Fox's thinking, as it goes head-to-head against Comcast, a U.S. cable operator, in its bid to acquire European pay-TV company Sky Plc SKYB.L, in which Fox holds a 39 percent stake.  Comcast announced in February it was working on a $31 billion bid that would top Fox\u2019s deal for Sky. It has not made a new attempt to bid for the Fox assets after the Disney deal, so investors are keen for information on the hurdles that prevented an agreement between Fox and Comcast.  The filing does not mention Comcast by name, but refers to it as Party B. Another bidder for the Fox assets, U.S. wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N, is referred to as Party A.  Verizon and Comcast representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Comcast on Nov. 14 offered to acquire most of Fox\u2019s assets in an all-stock deal valued at $34.41 per share, the filings said. Fox ended up announcing an all-stock deal with Disney for $29.54 per share.  Like Disney, Comcast sought to buy Fox\u2019s entertainment networks, movie studios, television production and international assets, the documents show.  In the filing, Disney and Fox said the ongoing antitrust scrutiny of U.S. telecommunications provider AT&T Inc's T.N planned merger with media conglomerate Time Warner Inc TWX.N heightened concerns about potential regulatory hurdles to Comcast's bid. The U.S. Department of Justice has sued AT&T and Time Warner to thwart their deal, and the case is in court.  The companies added that, unlike Disney, Comcast declined to offer a reverse deal termination fee, which would compensate Fox in the event that regulators stymied a deal. Disney offered a reverse termination fee of $2.5 billion.  The companies also said that Fox saw Disney\u2019s stock as more valuable than Comcast\u2019s, based on historic prices, and felt that a deal between Disney and Fox would generate greater long-term value. The Roberts family controls Comcast through a dual-class stock structure.  Comcast\u2019s proposal, on the other hand, would reduce the compensation offered to Fox shareholders in the event that asset sales were required to reassure antitrust regulators, increasing the potential risk to Fox shareholders, the filing said.  Verizon\u2019s bid was rejected because it offered to acquire Fox at market value, without a meaningful premium, according to the filing.","256":"LONDON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp, the biggest U.S. cable operator, said on Tuesday it was making a cash offer to buy Sky for 22.1 billion pounds ($31 billion), challenging Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox to take over the European pay-TV group.  21st Century Fox had already agreed a deal to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - The price tag for Twenty-First Century Fox assets keeps increasing as Walt Disney and Comcast fight for bits of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s empire. Yet one number just gets smaller: the return on investment for whoever wins.  Disney and Comcast\u2019s dueling bids \u2013 and the parallel fight between Fox and Comcast over European pay-TV group Sky, in which Fox owns 39 percent \u2013 are being fueled by strategic necessity, ego and a devil-may-care approach to financial logic. Disney\u2019s last offer of $71.3 billion for Fox\u2019s entertainment and international assets is more than a third higher than what it initially agreed to pay last year.  The next step may be that Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts raises his offer too. He sweetened his bid for Sky by 18 percent on Wednesday. But Roberts starts on the back foot with Fox. The U.S. Department of Justice on June 27 approved Disney\u2019s transaction so long as it sells Fox\u2019s cluster of regional sports networks, which means the Mouse House can argue its bid is already close to being deliverable.  While the price escalates, what the bidders get stays the same. The Fox assets up for sale could contribute about $5.3 billion of operating profit in 2020, taking Fox\u2019s own estimates and deducting depreciation equivalent to around 2 percent of revenue. Fox\u2019s stake in Sky adds another $1 billion or so.  Then there are synergies, of which Disney is targeting $2 billion annually. Comcast reckons it can cut about the same, aside from any benefits if it snags Sky. Take the sum total of $8.3 billion and tax it at 21 percent, and whoever wins Fox will make back about $6.6 billion a year on their investment.  When Disney boss Bob Iger first offered $52.4 billion plus the assumption of $13.7 billion of debt, that would have meant a return of about 10 percent \u2013 higher than Fox\u2019s cost of capital of around 8 percent. Now it\u2019s just under that threshold. If Comcast ups the ante with a higher bid, the return will fall further, destroying value.  Iger and Roberts are both savvy acquirers and have deftly integrated past deals. But whoever loses out will have avoided a heap of integration risk, a mass of debt, and an investment that doesn\u2019t wash its face \u2013 while leaving their rival saddled with all three.","259":"MILAN (Reuters) - Italy\u2019s top pay-TV operator SKY said on Tuesday it was adding broadband connection to its offering of movies, sport and other content, to boost revenues in the crowded telecoms market.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The Comcast unit CMCSA.O announced the move after a two-month lockdown to curb a coronavirus epidemic, when data traffic using fixed lines almost doubled in Italy as people worked and studied from home, and spent free time streaming videos.  \u201cWe\u2019re interested in becoming the main player in people\u2019s living rooms and the rest of their homes,\u201d the head of SKY\u2019s Italian operations, Maximo Ibarra, said in a presentation, adding that SKY did not plan to offer mobile services.  Italy has one of the lowest rates of fibre-to-home usage in Europe. Demand for ultra-fast connections is expected to rise as many people are likely to continue working from home.  Ibarra said SKY had invested 230 million euros ($261 million) to start its broadband service.  It will use the fibre-optic infrastructure of wholesaler Open Fiber, jointly owned by Italian utility Enel ENEI.MI and state lender CDP.  SKY\u2019s service will start in 26 cities this month and will extend to 120 during the summer.  Ibarra said it would spread further as Open Fiber's coverage expanded. In the meantime, SKY has signed a deal with Swisscom's Fastweb SCMN.S to reach clients in areas not currently covered by Open Fiber.  SKY's move into broadband will add pressure on the former state phone monopoly Telecom Italia (TIM) TLIT.MI, which has been losing fixed-line market share.  Rome has made ultra-fast broadband a priority and urged TIM and Open Fiber to agree on creating a single network.  Ibarra said a single network was best for Italy but that it must not be controlled by a vertically integrated operator such as TIM.","260":"(Reuters) - NBCUniversal\u2019s long-awaited streaming service, Peacock, will launch free to some Comcast Corp customers on Wednesday with a limited slate of new content, as productions for its original programming have been halted amid the global coronavirus pandemic.  Peacock will promote its library of existing TV shows and movies like \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cJurassic Park\u201d as Americans seek out \u201ccomforting and familiar\u201d content as they grapple with life during the pandemic, Comcast executives told a news conference call on Tuesday.  People who currently subscribe to Comcast\u2019s Xfinity X1 or Flex TV services will receive Peacock Premium for free beginning on Wednesday. They will get more than 15,000 hours of content, including early access to \u201cThe Tonight Show: At Home Edition\u201d hosted by Jimmy Fallon.  Comcast has about 14 million Xfinity X1 customers, but has not disclosed the number of Flex customers.  Peacock Premium will launch nationwide on July 15 for everyone for $5 a month but remain free for Comcast X1 and Flex customers.  A free version of Peacock with 7,500 hours of content, and an ad-free tier that costs $10 per month will also launch on July 15. NBCUniversal is evaluating whether to move up the nationwide launch date, Matt Strauss, chairman of Peacock, said on Tuesday\u2019s call.  Peacock is one of the last entrants into the so-called streaming wars, which is dominated by Netflix Inc and Walt Disney Co\u2019s streaming service Disney+.  The service is launching with a group of 10 sponsors including Target Corp , Verizon Communication Inc and Capital One Financial Corp, which will work with Peacock to create advertising formats such as \u201cshoppable\u201d ads.  The advertising industry has seen unprecedented losses as brands have cut their marketing budgets as they struggle with business uncertainty during the pandemic.  Peacock is getting high interest from advertisers because the free version of the service will have wide appeal with viewers, and commercial time will be limited to five minutes per hour, Strauss said.  \u201cDelivering a service that is free is arguably more relevant now than at any other point in time,\u201d he said.","261":"Disney character Mickey Mouse attends the 25th anniversary of Disneyland Paris at the park in Marne-la-Vallee, near Paris, France, April 12, 2017  LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Sky shareholders may be unduly worried about a truce. Shares in the pay-TV group are down 2 percent since suitor Comcast last week said it wouldn\u2019t challenge Walt Disney\u2019s bid for most of Twenty-First Century Fox. Yet the Mickey Mouse owner could still prove a nuisance to Comcast in the battle for Sky, to investors\u2019 gain.  Sky\u2019s falling share price suggests investors think that Comcast\u2019s defeat will also defuse the battle for the UK group. After losing out to Disney\u2019s $71 billion bid for Fox assets, including its 39 percent Sky stake, Comcast boss Brian Roberts said he\u2019ll instead focus on buying Sky, for which he is competing with Fox. For Roberts to get full control, he will need Fox to sell its stake. That might suit Disney, as it would help fund the larger deal.  But a truce may not be in Disney\u2019s interest. Boss Bob Iger called Sky the \u201ccrown jewel\u201d of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox empire. That\u2019s because he could use its technology and streaming service to channel Disney\u2019s TV shows and movies directly to consumers. Sky, which reaches 120 million people, is the only way Disney can gain scale in Europe.  Iger has already shown he is happy to pay up. When Fox raised its offer to 14 pounds per share, Disney agreed to reimburse the difference above 13 pounds in case the wider tie-up fails. Stretching to 15 pounds per share, enough to trump Comcast\u2019s latest offer, would cost an extra $1.4 billion \u2013 small in the context of the bigger Fox deal.  Iger and Murdoch have an advantage over Roberts. Disney\u2019s acquisition of Fox assets includes the 39 percent stake in Sky, so the cost of a raise would only apply to the 61 percent it doesn\u2019t own. That means any price increase does more damage to Comcast than Disney. And Iger has little reason to let Comcast win easily, since Roberts has plenty of firepower that\u2019s now concentrated only on Sky.  Investors are not betting on a big raise. Sky\u2019s share price is 15.08 pounds, just 2 percent above Comcast\u2019s latest offer. Second-guessing Iger is risky. He might just let Comcast buy out other Sky investors, and then hold out for a better price. Still, there\u2019s a good chance that Sky\u2019s takeover war gets even more heated.","262":"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's takeover regulator is considering whether Walt Disney DIS.N might have to make a higher offer for Sky SKYB.L in the wake of the U.S. company's move to hike its bid for Twenty-First Century Fox assets to $71.3 billion.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Sky, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox, Disney and Comcast are in the midst of complicated takeover battle that revolves around competing offers for the bulk of Fox\u2019s film and television assets and London-listed broadcaster Sky.  In December 2016, Fox offered 10.75 pounds-a-share to acquire the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own, only for Comcast to make a rival 12.50 pounds-per-share counterbid for the London-listed company in February.  At the same time, both Disney and Comcast are vying to acquire Fox\u2019s TV and film assets, which include Fox\u2019s 39 percent stake in Sky.  Disney last week raised its cash-and-shares offer for the Fox assets to $38-a-share from its original offer of $28-per-share, to trump a rival $35-a-share all-cash bid made by Comcast.  Britain\u2019s Takeover Panel said on Thursday that its executive was now examining the implications for Sky of Disney\u2019s improved offer for the Fox assets on June 20.  In April, the panel ruled that under its so-called \u201cchain principle\u201d, Disney must offer to buy all of Sky if it acquires Fox\u2019s 39 percent stake in the broadcaster, provided that neither Fox nor Comcast had already succeeded with their own offers for the British company.  At the time, the panel said Disney would need to offer Sky\u2019s minority shareholders 10.75 pounds-a-share if the U.S. giant was obliged to make a chain principle offer.  \u201cThe executive is considering what impact the 20 June increase (by Disney for the Fox assets) should have on the consideration payable under the chain principle offer and will make a further announcement in due course,\u201d the takeover regulator said on Thursday.  It added that it had \u201creceived submissions from a number of parties expressing diverging views in relation to this matter, including from Disney, Fox and the independent directors of Sky.\u201d  Fox\u2019s original 10.75 pounds-a-share offer valued all of Sky at 18.5 billion pounds, while Comcast\u2019s 12.50 pounds-a-share bid put a 22.1 billion-pound price tag on the British broadcaster.  If the panel now decides that Disney must make a mandatory offer for Sky that is higher than 10.75 pounds-a-share, it would essentially set a new floor under the price of the UK company\u2019s shares.  Sky stock was barely changed on Thursday, closing up less than 0.1 percent at 14.535 pounds.","263":"(Repeats for wider distribution.)  June 20 (Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc\u2019s board is set to decide on Wednesday whether to entertain Comcast Corp\u2019s $65 billion cash bid for the New York-based media company or stick with its roughly $52 billion all-stock offer from Walt Disney Co, people familiar with the matter said.  Disney and Comcast are battling to win Fox\u2019s movie and television studios at a time when legacy media and distribution companies are looking to expand to better compete with younger media firms like Netflix Inc that sell their content directly to viewers. Fox\u2019s international assets such as Star India appeal to both Disney and Comcast, which want to expand their global presence.  While Fox\u2019s board has yet to make a decision, analysts and industry dealmakers widely expect Fox to say that Comcast\u2019s bid could potentially lead to a better deal for its shareholders. If it does, Fox would then be allowed to negotiate with Comcast and take a closer look at its offer. This would be the time for Fox to learn more about Comcast\u2019s commitments when it comes to regulatory approval, for example.  \u201cLet the ping-pong tournament begin, as Comcast won\u2019t let Fox brush off its all-cash premium offer without a fight,\u201d Macquarie analyst Amy Yong said in a research note last week.  Once Fox engages in talks with Comcast, it will then have to determine if the offer is definitively a superior deal for Fox shareholders, compared with its agreement with Disney. This will be the first step that could lead to a bidding war as Disney will then have five business days to put a revised offer on the table, according to its merger agreement.  Disney could sweeten its all-stock bid with cash, given its strong balance sheet and the potential boost to earnings per share, according to the people familiar with the matter.  Technically, Fox could also rebuff Comcast\u2019s bid on Wednesday, but that is unlikely, said Morningstar analyst Allan Nichols.  \u201cBecause of the liabilities of the board I don\u2019t think they can outright say no to Comcast\u2019s offer. You at least need to do some kind of review process,\u201d he said.  TAX, ANTITRUST CONCERNS  In its review, Fox will need to decide whether Comcast\u2019s richer, all-cash offer is enough to offset the antitrust risk and potentially higher tax liabilities for some of its shareholders, analysts said.  A U.S. court\u2019s recent approval of AT&T Inc\u2019s merger with Time Warner Inc raised the likelihood that Comcast\u2019s similar proposed deal with Fox would get the green light from regulators, they said.  However, there are still concerns that some aspects of the proposed deal could complicate an antitrust review, they added.  Craig Moffett, an analyst at Moffett Nathanson, said that the Justice Department never addressed the question of whether internet providers such as Comcast could give an advantage to its own content at the expense of competitors.  For example, Comcast could give its internet subscribers easier or faster access to content from Hulu, which it would gain control over by buying Fox, than that of other media streaming services, the analysts said.  If an all-cash bid does eventually beat a stock offer, it could have a bigger tax hit on Rupert Murdoch, Fox\u2019s largest shareholder, who controls 17 percent of the company\u2019s voting shares along with his family.  Reuters previously reported before the details of Comcast\u2019s offer were made public that the financial impact on Murdoch would be big enough for him to prefer an all-stock transaction, which would be nontaxable for all Fox shareholders. That potentially puts Murdoch, who remains the most powerful voice inside the company, at odds with some Fox shareholders who would be open to abandoning the Disney deal if Comcast\u2019s cash offer was high enough.

As the streaming wars heat up, TV viewers are watching video content online, through internet-connected TVs and even on social media apps, posing a challenge for advertisers, who often have to work with multiple different advertising tech tools or sales teams to buy ads and then manually compare how many people saw the ads.  The media company within cable TV provider Comcast is now launching a consolidated tech system, called One Platform, to make it easier for advertisers to purchase ads across the different places where NBCUniversal content is shown, such as its cable channels and new streaming service Peacock.  \u201cUp until now, there\u2019s been a value trade-off that marketers have had to contend with,\u201d said Linda Yaccarino, NBCUniversal chairman of advertising and partnerships. \u201cStorytelling and premium content, or scale. Targeting or reach. Technology or safety. Not anymore. Thanks to NBCUniversal\u2019s One Platform, for the first time ever, marketers will have the best of both worlds - all in one place.\u201d  NBCUniversal said advertisers will be able to target viewers based on age and gender, the traditional metrics by which TV commercials are sold, across TV, digital and streaming by using One Platform.  They will also be able to target viewers in more advanced ways, such as based on their interests and the types of content they watch.  The new capabilities for advertisers with One Platform come a few months before the annual upfronts, a crucial advertising period in May when advertisers buy commercials in advance for the upcoming TV season.  NBCUniversal said it will also expand its CFlight measurement system to include out-of-home advertising like billboards and short-form videos.  The company launched CFlight in 2018 to unify how viewership of an ad is counted regardless of where it is shown, but was previously limited to measuring ads on NBCUniversal\u2019s TV channels and some streaming services like Hulu.

If the deal went ahead, international revenue would make up 25 percent of Comcast\u2019s total, up from 9 percent currently, according to the company.  A key gain for Comcast would be Sky\u2019s success earlier this month in winning the rights to show Premier League soccer matches for a fee well below analyst expectations, likely a boost to future earnings.  SKEPTICAL INVESTORS  Comcast offered 12.50 pounds in cash per Sky share on Tuesday, well above the 10.75 pounds Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOXA.O - run by Roberts' rival Rupert Murdoch - had agreed to pay for the British company.  That complicates Walt Disney Co's DIS.N $52-billion deal to buy a range of Fox assets, including Sky, which was based on the assumption that Fox would complete its purchase.  Investors and analysts met Comcast\u2019s offer for Europe\u2019s biggest pay-TV broadcaster with some skepticism, sending Comcast shares down 6 percent on Tuesday. Disney shares were also down 3.7 percent. Sky shares jumped 20 percent.  A Sky deal would provide additional channels for Comcast-owned content in Europe but also tie it further to satellite distribution, a technology growing obsolete in the United States, said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson.  The all-cash deal would likely limit Comcast\u2019s share buybacks, said Hank Smith, co-chief investment officer at Haverford Trust Co, which owns 3.35 million Comcast shares.  \u201cThere was a fair amount of hedge fund ownership that was expecting accelerated buybacks,\u201d said Smith, addressing Comcast\u2019s share drop on Tuesday. \u201cIf that was your thesis for owning Comcast that\u2019s going to be on hold for now. There\u2019s also concern that this becomes a bidding war.\u201d  Such a bidding war could mean that if Disney wants to block Comcast and own all of Sky, it would have to pay more than 14 pounds a share, according to a note on Tuesday by London-based Square Global Markets.  TAXI DRIVER  Roberts, 58, took over as head of Comcast from his father, Ralph, who founded the company in 1963. The younger Roberts became Comcast\u2019s president in 1990 and CEO in 2002, having spent his whole career at the company.  Any deal would raise Roberts\u2019 profile as one of the most powerful media leaders. He brokered the 2001 deal with AT&T Broadband that turned the cable company into a national player. He led Comcast\u2019s failed effort to buy Disney for $54 billion in 2004.  His $37-billion deal in 2009 to combine General Electric Co's GE.N NBCUniversal business and Comcast's cable networks put him in charge of more than 20 million subscribers of video, internet and voice services, the broadcast network known for \"Friends\" and \"Seinfeld,\" plus theme parks and the film studio.  When Roberts was weighing an offer for Sky, a trip to see Sky\u2019s products in store, and the knowledge of the London taxi driver that took him there, helped to make up his mind.  \u201cThe cab driver was incredibly knowledgeable about the difference between Virgin and Sky in every feature,\u201d Roberts told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cWe were learning a lot there. Then when we went to the Sky store, we spent at least an hour going through every feature and comparing it to our own... We were really terribly impressed.\u201d  Liberty Global-owned LBTYA.O Virgin Media is a British rival to Sky.  The CEO said the visit was one of a number of things that confirmed his company should try to acquire Sky.  \u201cSeeing it again, and listening to the passion of the sales and looking at the product... all those things combined to reinforce what a number of us have known for years - that this is a jewel,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cFrankly there\u2019s nothing as great in the United States.\u201d","266":"LOS ANGELES, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp\u2019s MSNBC led primetime cable news ratings on Tuesday as election returns rolled in from the crucial U.S. Senate races in Georgia, Nielsen ratings data showed.

Revenue from the business grew 7.2% to $5 billion.  Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal segment, which includes NBC Entertainment and Universal Pictures, reported revenue of $6.12 billion, down 25.4% from a year earlier. Revenue at the filmed entertainment unit fell 18.1% from a year earlier due to shuttered movie theaters. Theme park revenue plummeted 94.1%.  Broadcast TV advertising revenue was down 27.9% and ad revenue at Comcast\u2019s cable networks fell 27%.  The company said it had 10 million signups to its Peacock streaming service, launched nationwide on July 15.  On Tuesday Comcast and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc , the world\u2019s largest theater chain, announced a deal that will allow Universal Pictures\u2019 movies to be made available to U.S. audiences at home after three weekends in cinemas - a model that upends the traditional practice of keeping a movie in theaters for 90 days before releasing it on other platforms.  Comcast\u2019s video losses in the second quarter were better than expected. The company lost 477,000 video customers, fewer than the 513,000 loss estimated by FactSet and more than the 409,000 video customers it lost in the first quarter.

The show of continued momentum in the third quarter comes after the media conglomerate beat Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Twenty-First Century Fox to buy satellite TV broadcaster Sky for $40 billion in a sealed-bid auction in September.  Executives are expected to take a victory lap and spend an extra half hour on Thursday morning to introduce Sky Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Darroch to Wall Street analysts on a conference call.  Revenue from high-speed internet rose 9.6 percent to $4.32 billion in the quarter as the company added 363,000 internet subscribers, beating an average estimate of 294,000, according to research firm FactSet. The company said it was the best performance for the division in ten years.  Comcast also said in October its fastest-speed gigabit internet service reached more homes than any other provider in the United States after it completed a rollout to nearly all of the 58 million homes and businesses it serves.  The biggest U.S. cable provider said it lost 106,000 video customers, down from the 125,000 customers it lost in the same quarter last year, as some TV viewers dropped pricey cable bills for cheaper streaming options like AT&T Inc\u2019s newly-launched WatchTV or Netflix.  Wall Street had expected a steeper decline of 152,000, according to FactSet. Revenue from its video segment fell nearly 3 percent to $5.59 billion.  Net income attributable to Comcast rose 9.2 percent to $2.89 billion, or 62 cents per share, from $2.64 billion, or 55 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, the company earned 65 cents.

Bloomberg reported earlier this week that Comcast and Charter Communications Inc were in discussions with U.S. regulators to buy wireless spectrum. T-Mobile and Sprint were considering divesting spectrum back to the government, which would then sell it to help establish a fourth carrier.  But an industry source familiar with the discussion said the spectrum would not be enough to create a viable fourth carrier. The source also said Comcast is not interested in buying Boost Mobile, Sprint\u2019s pre-paid brand that will be divested if the T-Mobile and Sprint merger goes through.  The $26-billion merger deal won support from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission last week, but still needs approval from the U.S. Department of Justice, which is looking at the merger on antitrust grounds.","270":"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp CMCSA.O offered $65 billion on Wednesday to lure Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOXA.O away from a merger with Walt Disney Co DIS.N, setting up a bidding war between two of the largest U.S. media companies with its 20 percent higher offer.  Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts said he was highly confident regulators would allow Comcast to acquire most of Fox's media assets after AT&T Inc's T.N court victory on Tuesday, which allowed it to buy Time Warner Inc TWX.N for $85 billion.  The fight to win Fox\u2019s assets is shaping up to be a summer blockbuster starring well-known media moguls, led by Rupert Murdoch who built Fox into a global media empire. Comcast\u2019s Roberts, who led a failed bid for Disney in 2004, now faces off against Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger, whose own dealmaking has added heroes from Pixar, Star Wars and Marvel comics to the home of Mickey Mouse.  Fox\u2019s board will now have to decide whether Comcast\u2019s offer beats Disney\u2019s. If Fox prefers Comcast, Disney will have five business days to respond.  Comcast may have a tough time winning over Fox\u2019s largest shareholder, the Murdoch family. They own a 17-percent stake and would face a multi-billion dollar capital gains tax bill by accepting an all-cash offer from Comcast, tax experts previously told Reuters.  Fox shareholders will vote July 10 on the Disney transaction but the company could postpone the meeting, Fox said in a statement.  Some analysts see difficulties for Comcast-Fox, which would add Fox\u2019s movie and television studios to Comcast\u2019s NBC Universal, but Roberts said in a letter to Fox that he would offer the same conditions as Disney and promised to fight for the deal in court if necessary.  Comcast is expected to lead a wave of traditional media companies trying to combine distribution and production to compete with Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google. The younger firms produce content, sell it online directly to consumers and often offer lucrative targeted advertising.  A merger between Fox and Comcast would create a company with a stable of well-known media brands and franchises, such as the X-Men superheroes. A combined company would hold the rights to air Fox\u2019s long running TV show \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d, the U.S. rights to the Olympics and Premier League Soccer.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  Fox\u2019s international assets such as Star India appeal to both Disney and Comcast, which want to expand their global presence.  Major sports and news assets including Fox News, Fox Business Network and Fox Sports would be spun off into a separate company.  Shares of Comcast, Fox and Disney were barely changed in after-hours trade.  Comcast in a statement outlined an offer that was similar to Disney\u2019s, including a commitment to the same divestitures. It said that it would go to court and fight if the Justice Department tried to block the deal.  Comcast offered $35 per Fox share for the media assets, compared with Disney\u2019s stock offer, worth $29.18 per share at the close of trade on Wednesday.  Comcast offered a $2.5 billion reverse termination fee if the deal did not go through, the same as Disney. It also offered to pay Fox\u2019s $1.525 billion breakup fee owed Disney, if Fox went with Comcast.  Comcast said it intended to pursue its $30 billion acquisition of Sky Plc SKYB.L in parallel with its Fox bid. Comcast bid for Sky in April, after Fox's bid for the remainder of European pay-TV group it did not already own was delayed by regulators.  Fox in a statement said it had received the proposal and would review it.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  Justice Department lawyers who tried to stop AT&T\u2019s $85 billion deal expect consumers will lose out as bigger companies raise prices, and some lawyers saw that as a concern in a Comcast-Fox deal which would put two movie studios and two major television brands under one roof.  \u201cOne cannot ignore the fact that there\u2019s less independent content to go around,\u201d after the AT&T deal, said Henry Su, an antitrust expert with Constantine Cannon LLP.  Still, the AT&T court fight gave Comcast valuable information about how to structure a Fox deal, said David Scharf, a litigation expert with Morrison Cohen.  Disney itself has \u201csurgically\u201d structured a transaction that \u201cmight be doable,\u201d avoiding Fox Broadcasting and big Fox sports channels, U.S. antitrust chief Makan Delrahim said last week.  \u201cI don\u2019t think either will have a significant advantage over the other,\u201d given that both Disney and Comcast seem motivated to divest what they need to win a deal with Fox, said Ketan Jhaveri, a former Justice Department attorney who served on the telecommunications task force.","271":"FILE PHOTO: A Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) computer lesson is seen on a student\u2019s computer, during the global outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Los Angeles, California, U.S., August 18, 2020.

The Philadelphia-based cable company reported fourth-quarter revenue of $28.4 billion, beating the Wall Street consensus estimate of $28.17 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Revenue growth was aided by British pay-TV group Sky, which the company acquired for $39 billion in 2018. The business generated fourth-quarter revenue of $5.04 billion, beating the average estimate of $4.82 billion.  Comcast continued to lose cable TV subscribers as viewers flocked to streaming services, but those losses happened at a greater rate than Wall Street expected. Even so, it beat the Wall Street consensus estimate for revenue from video subscribers.  It lost 149,000 video customers, more than a loss of 139,000 estimated by research firm FactSet, but fewer than the 238,000 video customers it lost in the third quarter.  Comcast has been vocal about its effort to chase broadband customers to offset cord-cutting, as viewers who stream TV and film require a broadband connection to do so.  The company gained 442,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of 378,000 net additions, according to FactSet. Revenue from that business grew 8.8% to $4.79 billion.  Comcast will be making its own entrance into the streaming video war on April 15, when it launches its advertising-supported Peacock streaming service to Comcast customers, followed by a launch across the United States on July 15.

FILE PHOTO: Rupert Murdoch, Chairman of Fox News Channel stands before Rafael Nadal of Spain plays against Kevin Anderson of South Africa. Tennis - US Open - Mens Final - New York, U.S. - September 10, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Segar  Disney and Comcast are battling to win Fox's movie and television studios at a time when legacy media and distribution companies are looking to expand to better compete with younger media firms like Netflix Inc NFLX.O that sell their content directly to viewers. Fox\u2019s international assets such as Star India appeal to both Disney and Comcast, which want to expand their global presence.  While Fox\u2019s board has yet to make a decision, analysts and industry dealmakers widely expect Fox to say that Comcast\u2019s bid could potentially lead to a better deal for its shareholders. If it does, Fox would then be allowed to negotiate with Comcast and take a closer look at its offer. This would be the time for Fox to learn more about Comcast\u2019s commitments when it comes to regulatory approval, for example.  \u201cLet the ping-pong tournament begin, as Comcast won\u2019t let Fox brush off its all-cash premium offer without a fight,\u201d Macquarie analyst Amy Yong said in a research note last week.  Once Fox engages in talks with Comcast, it will then have to determine if the offer is definitively a superior deal for Fox shareholders, compared with its agreement with Disney. This will be the first step that could lead to a bidding war as Disney will then have five business days to put a revised offer on the table, according to its merger agreement.  Disney could sweeten its all-stock bid with cash, given its strong balance sheet and the potential boost to earnings per share, according to the people familiar with the matter.  Technically, Fox could also rebuff Comcast\u2019s bid on Wednesday, but that is unlikely, said Morningstar analyst Allan Nichols.  \u201cBecause of the liabilities of the board I don\u2019t think they can outright say no to Comcast\u2019s offer. You at least need to do some kind of review process,\u201d he said.  TAX, ANTITRUST CONCERNS  In its review, Fox will need to decide whether Comcast\u2019s richer, all-cash offer is enough to offset the antitrust risk and potentially higher tax liabilities for some of its shareholders, analysts said.  A U.S. court's recent approval of AT&T Inc's T.N merger with Time Warner Inc TWX.N raised the likelihood that Comcast's similar proposed deal with Fox would get the green light from regulators, they said.  However, there are still concerns that some aspects of the proposed deal could complicate an antitrust review, they added.  Craig Moffett, an analyst at Moffett Nathanson, said that the Justice Department never addressed the question of whether internet providers such as Comcast could give an advantage to its own content at the expense of competitors.  For example, Comcast could give its internet subscribers easier or faster access to content from Hulu, which it would gain control over by buying Fox, than that of other media streaming services, the analysts said.  If an all-cash bid does eventually beat a stock offer, it could have a bigger tax hit on Rupert Murdoch, Fox\u2019s largest shareholder, who controls 17 percent of the company\u2019s voting shares along with his family.  Reuters previously reported before the details of Comcast\u2019s offer were made public that the financial impact on Murdoch would be big enough for him to prefer an all-stock transaction, which would be nontaxable for all Fox shareholders.  That potentially puts Murdoch, who remains the most powerful voice inside the company, at odds with some Fox shareholders who would be open to abandoning the Disney deal if Comcast\u2019s cash offer was high enough.","274":"(Adds T-Mobile, Gazprom, Mothercare, EDP, Paddy Power ,Royal Golden Eagle; Updates Generali, Comcast, Aretex Capital)  May 23 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 2000 GMT on Wednesday:  ** Comcast Corp confirmed it was preparing a higher, all-cash offer for most of the media assets of Twenty-First Century Fox, setting up a bidding war with rival Walt Disney Co, which already has agreed to a $52-billion deal with Fox.  ** A U.S. Senate Committee plans to hold a hearing on June 27 on the proposed $26.5 billion merger of T-Mobile US and Sprint Corp.  ** Portugal\u2019s market watchdog has waived a requirement in its takeover rules that will make it easier for China Three Gorges to pursue its bid for utility EDP-Energias de Portugal .  ** Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, who has been placed under U.S. sanctions, has resumed talks about merging his power assets with Gazprom, three sources familiar with the talks told Reuters.  ** Singapore group Royal Golden Eagle said it had reached a deal to acquire Brazilian pulp maker Lwarcel Celulose Ltda for an undisclosed amount.  ** Paddy Power Betfair has agreed to merge its U.S. business with fantasy sports company FanDuel to target the U.S. sports betting market that is set to open up in the coming years, the Irish bookmaker said.  ** Mothercare has decided a management buyout is \u201c100 percent not\u201d an option in the future, a source familiar with the matter said, after Bloomberg reported that its CEO had proposed one earlier this year.  ** Insurer Generali CEE Holding BV, a part of Italian Generali Group, has agreed to buy Slovenia\u2019s third-largest insurer Adriatic Slovenica in a deal worth 245 million euros ($286.85 million) from KD Group.  ** Aretex Capital Partners, a private equity fund that was launched just this year, has agreed to buy Alerian, the developer of the energy benchmark Alerian MLP Index, Aretex said in a statement late.  ** Renault and Nissan are reviewing the ownership structure of their carmaking alliance but are unlikely to merge into a single listed entity this year or next, Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn said.  ** Barclays Plc is not actively exploring a potential merger with rivals, two sources close to the bank said, as speculation mounts about how the British lender plans to defend itself against activist investor Edward Bramson.  ** China\u2019s Qumei Home Furnishing Group made an all-cash bid for Norway\u2019s Ekornes, valuing the Oslo-listed furniture maker at 5.1 billion Norwegian crowns ($630.75 million), the companies said in a joint statement.  ** Global miner Rio Tinto Ltd confirmed it was in discussions to sell its interest in the world\u2019s second largest copper mine to Indonesia\u2019s state mining holding company Inalum.  ** Thailand\u2019s Minor International Pcl said that it acquired a stake in Spain-based NH Hotel Group SA for 192 million euros ($225.79 million) to grow its hospitality footprint in Europe.  ** SoftBank Group Corp said it is selling its roughly 20 percent stake in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart IPO- to Walmart Inc, the first public divestment by its Vision Fund.  ** Australia\u2019s SeaLink Travel Group Ltd confirmed it received an unsolicited takeover proposal for the firm worth A$480.5 million ($363.64 million) from an undisclosed buyer which it rejected, sending its shares up as much as 12.3 percent.  ** Independent Bank Group Inc said on Tuesday it would buy Guaranty Bancorp for about $1 billion to expand its operations in the state of Colorado.  ** American Equity Investment Life Holding Co, a U.S. provider of annuities and life insurance products, is exploring a sale after it attracted takeover interest, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.  ** Japan\u2019s Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance will take a nearly 40 percent stake in a life insurance unit of a state-owned Chinese bank, the Nikkei reported.

Better data will make it easier for advertisers to buy ads to fit their targets and compare how the ads are performing, the companies said.  \u201cWe need to make sure it\u2019s easy for advertisers to track and measure their money with us,\u201d John Litster, managing director of Sky Media, said in an interview.  On linear television, or programs watched on broadcast networks or through cable and satellite, viewership for an ad is determined by the average commercial minute viewing, or the average rating over the course of a show when the ad was aired.  For digital ads, CFlight\u2019s standard requires the ad to be watched from beginning to end. Combined, the metric is able to determine the total views of an ad across linear and digital.  Sky Media\u2019s Germany and Italy segments will also use CFlight in the future, Litster said.  Sky is also in early talks with its competitors in Britain, TV channels ITV and Channel 4, to get them to adopt CFlight, he said.  Media company Viacom and TV advertising company Simulmedia are already using CFlight in the United States.  The metric is open-source, meaning anyone can see the methodology that CFlight uses to measure ad impressions, and the companies using it are not \u201cgrading their own homework,\u201d said Kavita Vazirani, executive vice president of strategic insights and analytics at NBCUniversal, in an interview.","280":"May 31 (Reuters) - U.S. cable operator Comcast Corp has no interest in acquiring divested spectrum from the Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc transaction, the company said on Friday.

FILE PHOTO: The Comcast NBC logo is shown on a building in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 13, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The media company gained 538,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of 488,000 net additions, according to research firm FactSet.  \u201cBroadband is the cornerstone of what we do, powered by our robust, flexible and reliable network,\u201d said Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts during the earnings call on Thursday.  The company said it is planning to resume stock buybacks later this year.  The COVID-19 pandemic has hurt movie ticket sales and theme park attendance in the company\u2019s NBCUniversal segment. But travel restrictions have helped drive demand for services like broadband and streaming video, as people continue to work and entertain themselves at home.  Comcast said it had 33 million sign-ups to its Peacock streaming service, which launched in July.  The company\u2019s NBCUniversal segment, which includes NBC Entertainment and Universal Pictures, reported revenue of $7.5 billion, down 18.1% from a year earlier. Revenue at the filmed entertainment unit fell 8.3% from a year earlier due to shuttered and reduced-capacity movie theaters. Broadcast TV revenue fell 12%. Theme parks revenue plummeted 62.9%.  The company said its theme parks division reached break-even in the quarter, excluding the preopening costs for Universal Beijing - which it plans to open this summer - and despite the continued closure of its park in California. Performance at the Florida and Osaka, Japan, parks - which were typically at COVID-19-level capacity during the quarter - helped the division break even, the company said.  Comcast lost 248,000 video customers in the quarter, fewer than the 260,000 loss estimated by FactSet.  The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 56 cents, down 29.1% from the same period a year earlier, and beating the Wall Street consensus estimate of 48 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  It reported fourth-quarter revenue of $27.71 billion. Analysts expected revenue of $26.78 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Shares of the company were up 3.5%.","283":"FILE PHOTO: The Comcast NBC logo is shown on a building in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 13, 2018.

The U.S. cable and media conglomerate will invest about $1.27 billion (about 1 billion pounds) in Sky Studios programming over the next five years.  \u201cChernobyl,\u201d a dramatization of the 1986 Soviet nuclear disaster, was one of Sky\u2019s most-watched original productions and a catalyst for the new investment, according to sources familiar with the company. The show, which aired on AT&T-owned HBO in the United States, stood out amid a flood of content available on Netflix and other streaming services to become part of the cultural zeitgeist.  Sky Studios will produce content for Comcast subsidiaries NBC and Universal Pictures as well as other distributors hungry for programming. It will focus on drama and comedy shot in English, Italian, German and other European languages, from low- to high-budget.  Philadelphia-based Comcast bought Sky in September, paying roughly $39 billion after outbidding 21st Century Fox in a months-long battle. In doing so, the U.S. telecom conglomerate expanded its reach into Europe and continued a move into content that accelerated with its 2011 acquisition of NBCUniversal.  News Corp Chairman Rupert Murdoch launched what was then Sky Television in 1989, building the company into a major European broadcaster over three decades.","284":"(Adds loan details)  LONDON, April 25 (LPC) - US cable operator Comcast Corp said on Wednesday that it is backing its offer for Sky Plc with \u00a323bn (US$32.06bn) of loans.
