Boeing Co BA.N has said it hopes to receive regulatory approval for updated flight control software at the center of both crashes in October, but it could take a month or two for airlines to train pilots on the new software and prepare the jets for commercial flight after sitting idle for months.  As the grounding that began in mid-March has dragged on, airlines that added the fuel-efficient, single-aisle MAX to their fleets in the past two years have had to cancel thousands of monthly flights, eating into their profits.  Chicago-based United had previously pulled its 14 737 MAX jets from its flight schedule through early November. Without the MAX, the carrier said it expects to cancel about 2,800 flights in November and 1,700 through Dec. 19.

The airline said on Saturday the last China-bound flights will now leave on Saturday, Feb. 1, and the last returning flights from China will depart China on Sunday.  China is facing mounting isolation from international travel curbs and flight suspensions as the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak rose to 259.  The epidemic has led to evacuations of foreign citizens, particularly from Hubei province and its capital Wuhan - the epicenter of the outbreak - and risks exacerbating a slowdown in growth in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.  All three major U.S. airlines - including United Airlines Holdings Inc and American Airlines Group Inc - have announced the cancellation of flights to mainland China.

Boeing is under pressure to upgrade the software and convince global regulators that the plane is safe to fly again, a process expected to take at least 90 days.  Chicago-based United, which is part of United Continental Holdings Inc, removed its 14 MAX aircraft from its flying schedule through early July, while U.S. competitors that own the MAX have planned their flying schedules without the aircraft into August.  United has another 16 MAX orders scheduled for delivery this year.  \u201cThe aircraft scheduled for delivery this year, we would expect to take this year,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Gerald Laderman said on a first-quarter conference call.  United posted a better-than-expected jump in first-quarter profit late on Tuesday after selling more tickets and cutting costs, and stood by its 2019 profit target despite the 737 MAX grounding. Its shares were up 4.0 percent at $88.62 on Wednesday afternoon.  Unlike other U.S. airlines that own the MAX, No. 3 United has largely avoided flight cancellations after the grounding, deferring nonessential maintenance on larger aircraft to put them on MAX routes.  But executives said on Wednesday that the strategy, manageable for a month or two, gets tougher as time goes on.  United has been expanding its available seat capacity at a faster pace than rivals but said on Tuesday it was trimming that 2019 target to reflect the grounded MAX as well as suspended flights to Delhi due to closed air space over Pakistan.  Laderman said the carrier\u2019s costs per seat mile could grow this year if the MAX aircraft remain out of service or flights to Delhi remain suspended longer than its current assumption.  Looking forward, he said United would discuss with Boeing compensation over costs incurred due to the MAX grounding, noting the temporary grounding of Boeing\u2019s 787 soon after it entered service in 2013 as a \u201chistorical reference.\u201d  Of the U.S. MAX owners, United was the first to report first-quarter results.

United has said the lawsuit was \u201cmeritless\u201d and the reductions, due to start on May 24, were in compliance with the terms of its $5 billion in federal assistance and its collective bargaining agreements.  However, in a memo to affected staff made public on Wednesday, the airline said a 25% reduction in work hours for full-time employees would now be optional, and that any volunteers would still retain full-time status.  \u201cGiven our continued need to cut costs across the entire company, this proposed program will only be successful if we have a high rate of participation,\u201d Chief Operations Officer Greg Hart said in the memo.

However, United and other carriers have warned that the aid does not fully cover their payroll costs, and with demand unlikely to recover to pre-crisis levels by the fall, they are looking at ways to start reducing costs as they prepare to downsize in October.  United said on Monday it planned to cut at least 3,450, or 30%, of its management and administrative workers on Oct. 1, and has told pilots to brace for changes as well.

REUTERS\/Loren Elliott\/File Photo  United, which operates 14 737 MAX jets, said the decision would lead to about 40 or 45 daily canceled flights.  The Chicago-based carrier joins rivals Southwest Airlines Co and American Airlines Group Inc which had already suspended 737 MAX flights into August as global carriers await regulatory approval for the aircraft to fly again.  The worldwide grounding in March of Boeing\u2019s fast-selling aircraft followed a crash in Indonesia and another in Ethiopia that killed a combined 346 people.  Since the grounding, U.S. airlines have had to readjust schedules and come up with solutions in order to meet demand during the busy summer travel season.  Reuters reported on Thursday that the Federal Aviation Administration expects to approve the 737 MAX jet to return to service as soon as late June, according to people familiar with the matter.  Even so, FAA acting administrator Dan Elwell told reporters on Thursday after a meeting with international air regulators in Texas that he would not assign a specific date for the U.S. approval.  Once regulators approve the 737 MAX jets for flight, each aircraft will likely require between 100 and 150 hours of preparation before flying, in addition to pilot training, Reuters also reported on Thursday.  United, whose parent company is United Continental Holdings Inc, was due to take delivery of 16 more MAX jets this year before the grounding.  \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to monitor the regulatory process and nimbly make the necessary adjustments to our operation and our schedule to benefit our customers who are traveling this summer,\u201d a United spokesman said in a statement on Friday.  Separately, United said on Friday it had launched a management overhaul at Colombia\u2019s cash-strapped Avianca Holdings, with which it is pursuing a three-way tie up with Panama\u2019s Copa.  The move, which removes Avianca\u2019s top shareholder, German Efromovich, from control and hands it to a third party, follows a default by his holding company on a $456 million loan from United.  United has been seeking to expand in Latin America, which is considered ripe for air travel growth.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  American is cancelling 737 MAX flights until Aug. 18 and United until Sept. 4, the two said in separate statements on Friday. The other U.S. 737 MAX operator, Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N, has extended its flight cancellations until Aug. 10.  The new timelines mean that the three carriers will be flying without the 737 MAX for the second straight U.S. summer, an issue that hit their profits during last year\u2019s peak travel season.  Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX was grounded worldwide last March after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people.  The U.S. planemaker has spent months updating software believed to have played a role in both crashes, but fresh issues have surfaced, complicating regulators\u2019 efforts to reapprove the plane.  The timing of a certification flight, a key step in the approval process, has been delayed repeatedly. The latest unofficial guidance was for the flight to happen this month, but now it is unlikely to occur while Boeing tries to resolve the new problems, sources said this week.  American, Southwest and United had been planning to fly the jets in early June if regulators had approved the plane in the first quarter, but that now looks unlikely.  One key issue yet to be resolved is whether Boeing must separate two wiring bundles that may be too close together, which could lead to a short circuit and crash if pilots do not respond appropriately.  Boeing has told the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration it does not believe it needs to separate wiring bundles, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.  Once regulators approve Boeing\u2019s fixes, airlines will still need around 30 days or longer to prepare their fleets and pilots before using the planes for commercial flight.  The longer the 737 MAX is grounded, the more Boeing will ultimately have to compensate its customers.  Boeing spent $1.4 billion on compensation for 737 MAX customers last year and Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said this week the company expects \u201ca good portion\u201d of additional settlements to take place this year.  Meanwhile, carriers including Delta Air Lines DAL.N that do not operate the 737 MAX are picking up travel demand that United, Southwest and American have been unable to meet given their reduced fleets.","10":"(Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc plans to cut at least 3,400 management and administrative positions in October as the coronavirus pandemic crushes air travel demand, and has told pilots to brace for changes as well, according to two memos seen by Reuters.

In a separate memo seen by Reuters, pilots were told to prepare for a \u201cdisplacement\u201d that will affect roughly 30% of roughly 12,250 pilots.  One pilot union official said the group was interpreting the message to mean a 30% reduction as soon as Oct. 1.  United sent memos on Monday to a number of work groups about near-term changes and potential long-term implications, spokeswoman Leslie Scott said.  \u201cTravel demand is essentially zero for the foreseeable future and, even with federal assistance that covers a portion of our payroll expense through Sept. 30, we anticipate spending billions of dollars more than we take in for the next several months, while continuing to employ 100% of our workforce,\u201d United spokesman Frank Benenati said in an email. \u201cThat\u2019s not sustainable for any company.\u201d  United and other airlines, which only months ago were mapping out growth plans, have parked jets and drastically cut flight schedules in an effort to reduce costs and shore up cash until demand recovers.","11":"May 19 (Reuters) - Two top U.S. airlines said on Tuesday ticket cancellations were slowing and demand was showing some signs of improvement, with Southwest Airlines Co recording more trip reservations than cancellations so far this month.  Airlines have been the among the worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic, which brought global travel to a virtual standstill and a $10 billion collective monthly cash burn for U.S. airlines, which have slashed their capacity.  With signs of improvement, Southwest -- with a more domestic focus than its large peers -- is adding some flights back to its network in June, which will see an overall annual capacity decline of between 45% and 55%, compared with a decline of 60% to 70% in May.  United Airlines Holdings Inc, which has greater international exposure, said its June capacity would still be down by about 90% year-on-year, and 75% in July.  Both companies continue to focus on reducing costs.  Southwest said its daily cash burn rate was slowing to the low-$20 million range in June from $30 million to $35 million in the overall second quarter.  United said its total adjusted capital expenditure for 2021 would be close to $2 billion versus around $4.5 billion this year, falling to below $500 million in 2022 when it does not expect to take delivery of any new aircraft.

Adjusted earnings per share rose to $1.15 in the first quarter, ending March 31, from 49 cents a year earlier, overcoming a U.S. government shutdown and severe winter weather earlier this year that curtailed flights.  Wall Street analysts on average had forecast 95 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Its shares rose 2.8 percent in after-hours trading.  United has largely avoided canceling MAX flights by servicing those routes with larger aircraft, but President Scott Kirby warned last week that the strategy could not last indefinitely.

Since then it has added more than 40 domestic routes, and on Monday it announced additional U.S. flights starting next year.  The growth, coupled with tighter cost control and higher ticket prices and fees, have helped the Chicago-based carrier counter a surge in crude oil prices.  United earned $3.13 per share, excluding the impact of tropical storms, which the carrier said diluted earnings per share by about 7 cents in the quarter.

But as the coronavirus pandemic has crushed air travel demand in the past two months, airlines including United have shifted their focus to survival.  \u201cMore than ever, United needs - and as CEO, I will need - an experienced, level-headed strategist who can help us continue to make smart decisions and aggressively manage this crisis,\u201d Kirby said in a memo to employees seen by Reuters.  Like Kirby, Hart will temporarily waive his salary, a measure that several top airline leaders are taking in an effort to cut costs.  Hart joined United from Sara Lee in 2010 as general counsel and served as acting CEO for six months when Munoz received treatment for a heart transplant. Under his current role as chief administrative officer, Hart was responsible for matters ranging from legal and environmental affairs to corporate real estate, government affairs and corporate communications.  Under the leadership transition effective May 20, Munoz will take on the role of executive chairman. The role of chief administrative officer will not be replaced.","22":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc UAL.O warned on Tuesday that travel demand will remain suppressed until there is a widely accepted treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, which plunged the carrier to a deep quarterly loss on Tuesday.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Coronavirus infections are surging in the United States, causing some states to scale back reopening plans and reinstate quarantines in a fresh blow to airlines.  United, which is not blocking middle seats, plans to fly about 35% of its 2019 summer schedule in the third quarter and is forecasting a load factor of about 45% in July. Its planes flew about one-third full in the second quarter.  The setback does not bode well for airline jobs in the fall, when a U.S. government stimulus package expires. To avoid furloughs, airlines have rolled out a number of packages to encourage employees to leave voluntarily.  Chicago-based United said more than 6,000 employees had opted for such packages. But after sending 36,000 notices of potential furloughs earlier this month, that relatively low take-up suggests United might have to furlough a significant number of workers.  Airline unions have urged lawmakers to pass another round of aid through March, but airlines say they are not counting on fresh funds.  Delta Air Lines DAL.N and Southwest Airlines LUV.N, which offered cash buyouts, have reported strong employee response for voluntary departures, meaning they could have a less costly workforce on the other side of the crisis since union contracts force airlines to furlough junior workers first.  While early data from trials of three potential COVID-19 vaccines released on Monday was encouraging, it is still far from clear whether the efforts will result in a vaccine capable of ending the global pandemic that has claimed more than 600,000 lives.  With the timing of a recovery uncertain, investor focus has turned to airlines\u2019 cash on hand and their ability to pick up demand once it returns.  United had $15.2 billion in liquidity as of July 20 and reiterated its forecast for liquidity to top $18 billion at the end of September as it taps additional capital.

Once the MAX is certified to fly again following software fixes by Boeing, some investors fear that airlines will have to lower fares to fill a potential surplus in domestic air travel capacity.  Speaking at a Morgan Stanley conference, Kirby played down those concerns.  \u201cThis is an industry that prices below the point where you would expect supply and demand to intercept today, which means there\u2019s room to raise fares,\u201d he said.  U.S. domestic capacity is seen growing by 6% or 7% over the next 12 months, versus around 2% or 2.5% growth currently, according to analysts.

There was little reference to Brazil, by far the region\u2019s largest market, when the alliance was announced on Friday, but Grajales said the parties to the agreement already had in mind Azul and Avianca Brasil, which operates independently of Colombia-based Avianca Holdings.  \u201cThe two airlines complement each other in the Brazilian market,\u201d Grajales said. \u201cFrom the beginning we thought that Brazil should be covered by our agreement, however, no partnership would be authorized if it did not have an Open Skies agreement.\u201d  The Open Skies agreement between Brazil and the United States was signed into law in May, when discussions among the three airlines were already advanced, he explained.  The airline agreement mimics a partnership between American Airlines and Chile\u2019s Latam Airlines which has been mired in regulatory scrutiny.  The announcement between the United Airlines parent, Avianca and Copa capped off almost two years of negotiations. United will loan Avianca\u2019s majority shareholder almost $500 million to be spent on ventures outside of the airline.

Even so, FAA acting administrator Dan Elwell told reporters on Thursday after a meeting with international air regulators in Texas that he would not assign a specific date for the U.S. approval.  Once regulators approve the 737 MAX jets for flight, each aircraft will likely require between 100 and 150 hours of preparation before flying, in addition to pilot training, Reuters also reported on Thursday.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Questioned repeatedly about the acquisition during a U.S. Senate hearing, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday, \u201cWe\u2019re looking very closely at this recent decision by Qatar to take on 49 percent of this airline.\u201d  Both Republicans and Democrats at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing said they were concerned that the deal with the Italian carrier violated an agreement Qatar Airways reached with the United States in early 2018.  \u201cThere are lots of consultations taking place,\u201d Pompeo said. In January, U.S. and Qatari officials met to discuss civil aviation matters, the State Department said earlier this year.  Since 2015 the largest U.S carriers - Delta Air Lines, American Airlines Group and United Airlines - have argued their Gulf rivals are being unfairly subsidized by their governments, distorting competition.  Gulf airlines have always denied those accusations and last year the three major Middle Eastern carriers reached a voluntary agreement, saying they would not add new flights to the United States.  However, Air Italy has been flying to New York and Miami since June last year and was due to start serving San Francisco and Los Angeles from this month and Chicago in May.  Qatar Airways acquired 49 percent of Italian airline Meridiana in 2017, rebranded it Air Italy and transformed it into a carrier with five announced non-stop U.S. destinations from Milan.  Scott Reed, campaign manager for the Partnership for Open & Fair Skies, a group representing the three largest U.S. airlines and aviation unions, said \u201cthe future of this industry \u2013 and the jobs it supports \u2013 depend on the Trump administration holding Qatar accountable for its trade-cheating actions.\u201d  In December, 11 Republican senators wrote a letter to Pompeo suggesting the flights from Milan \u201cwere consistent with Qatar Airways pattern of adding subsidized capacity in markets where demand is already well served.\u201d  Reed said \u201cthere is bipartisan concern that Qatar Airways is violating last year\u2019s agreement with the United States - making its finances more opaque instead of less and using Air Italy as a proxy to undermine the U.S. airline industry.\u201d  An aide to Senator Bob Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the foreign relations committee, noted that January marked the one-year anniversary of agreements between the United States and Qatar on government subsidies to Qatar Airways.  In a side letter to the agreements, the Qatari government indicated there was no intention to launch additional flights from Qatar to U.S. destinations but said some passengers would board flights in Europe before flying to U.S. destinations.","39":"May 6 (Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc said it plans to raise $2.25 billion through a bond offering as it grapples with a slump in air travel demand due to government-mandated lockdowns across the world.

The growth plan has allowed United to claw back market share in a competitive U.S. airline sector and boost its profitability. Traditionally capacity growth in the airline business has come at a cost to yields because it can drive down fares.  So far, United has bucked the industry trend, increasing unit revenues - a closely watched metric that compares airlines' sales to available seat miles - at a faster pace than rivals American Airlines AAL.O and Delta Air Lines DAL.N.  When the airline unveiled an aggressive plan to add capacity in the middle of a price war with low cost carriers in January, the stock of parent company United Continental Holdings UAL.N fell 7 percent.

Conferences and gatherings around the world have been canceled, and companies have changed work and travel plans. Plane maker Boeing Co itself on Wednesday said it was taking precautions including restricting travel to essential trips.  Chicago-based United\u2019s announcement followed a meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and the heads of major U.S. airlines at the White House where they discussed the effect of the virus on the industry and demand.  Concerns over the effect of reduced travel demand on airlines have hit airline shares and stoked fears of a financial bailout for the sector, an idea that the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday moved quickly to dismiss.  Trump also said on Wednesday that the airline executives had not asked for a bailout. After emerging from bankruptcy in the last decade and with new business models that include fees for everything from baggage to boarding, the U.S. airline majors are in a better financial position to weather a crisis, analysts have said.  UNCHARTED TERRITORY  The rapid, global spread of the virus has forced airlines to abandon their usual strategies for crisis management, which in the past have included lowering fares and redirecting flights to trouble-free areas.  Until now, United and other U.S. carriers had only reduced flying to the areas most hit by coronavirus cases, though international rivals Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd 0293.HK and British Airways recently announced broader reductions.  Leaders of the unions representing United\u2019s pilots and flight attendants called the move a \u201cresponsible approach\u201d to addressing the impact of COVID-19 on air travel.

Thursday\u2019s emergency order from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) came after Iran shot down a high-altitude U.S. drone with a surface-to-air missile, sparking concerns about a threat to the safety of commercial airlines.  The downing of the unarmed Global Hawk drone, which can fly up to 60,000 ft (18,300 m), was the latest in a series of incidents in the Gulf region, a critical artery for global oil supplies, that included explosive strikes on six oil tankers.  According to flight tracking applications, the FAA said, the nearest civil aircraft was operating within about 45 nautical miles of the unmanned aircraft when it was shot down.  \u201cThere were numerous civil aviation aircraft operating in the area at the time of the intercept,\u201d the FFA said, adding that its prohibition would stay in place until further notice.  Hours earlier, United Airlines suspended flights between New Jersey\u2019s Newark airport and India\u2019s financial capital of Mumbai following a safety review.  Cathay Pacific, Malaysia Airlines, Australia\u2019s Qantas Airways Ltd, Singapore Airlines Ltd, Germany\u2019s Lufthansa, British Airways and KLM of the Netherlands said they were re-routing flights to avoid the area.  Emirates Airlines and Etihad Airways, which were flying over the area earlier on Friday, according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24, said later they were also re-routing their flights.  \u2018THREAT IS REAL\u2019  The FAA said it remained concerned about the escalation of tension and military activity in close proximity to high-volume civil aircraft routes as well as Iran\u2019s willingness to use long-range missiles in international airspace with little or no warning.  In July 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down by a missile over Ukraine, killing all 298 on board, prompting carriers to take more steps to uncover threats to their planes.  But concerns persist over inadequate government intelligence sharing and a reluctance by countries involved in conflicts to divulge information or sacrifice overflight fees by closing their skies, according to safety experts.  The U.S. ban does not apply to airlines from other countries, but OPSGROUP, which provides guidance to operators, said carriers globally would take it into consideration.  \u201cSince MH17, all countries rely on advice from the U.S., the U.K., France and Germany to highlight airspace risk,\u201d it said.  \u201cThe threat of a civil aircraft shootdown in southern Iran is real,\u201d it added.  Restricting airspace complicates airline efforts to keep routes running in a region where airspace is already congested, in part due to ongoing conflicts which have made it unsafe to fly over some countries.  At 0820 GMT on Friday, Flightradar24 showed Qatar Airways flights in the area barred to U.S. carriers.

Etihad, which had said it was monitoring the situation, later said in a statement it had agreed \u201cto change a number of the flight paths we operate to and from the Arabian Gulf\u201d after close consultation with the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority.  FLIGHTS SUSPENDED  United said it had suspended its flights to India through Iran airspace after a \u201cthorough safety and security review,\u201d but did not say how long the suspension would last.  A United spokesman said customers flying from Mumbai to Newark would be booked on alternative flights back to the United States.  \u201cWe continue to explore all our options and remain in close contact with relevant government authorities,\u201d he added.  A Lufthansa spokesman said the company\u2019s planes had been avoiding the Strait of Hormuz since Thursday. He added that Lufthansa had extended the no-fly zone over Iran on Friday, without being more specific. The airline is still serving Iran\u2019s capital, Tehran.  Netherlands flag carrier KLM was no longer flying over the Strait of Hormuz, a spokesman said on Friday, while British Airways said it would adhere to the FAA guidance and use alternative routes.  Malaysia Airlines said it was avoiding the airspace, which it had previously used on flights between Kuala Lumpur and London, Jeddah and Medina.  Qantas said it was adjusting flight paths to avoid the Strait of Hormuz and Gulf of Oman until further notice. Singapore Airlines said some flights might require longer routings to avoid the area.

United disclosed its outlook in a memo to employees that it publicly released. The memo was from Chief Executive Oscar Munoz and President Scott Kirby.

It expects to fly fewer people during the entire month of May than it did on a single day in May of last year, Munoz and Kirby said.  \u201cThe historically severe economic impact of this crisis means even when travel demand starts to inch back, it likely will not bounce back quickly,\u201d they said.  \u201cWe believe that the health concerns about COVID-19 are likely to linger which means even when social distancing measures are relaxed, and businesses and schools start to reopen, life won\u2019t necessarily return to normal.\u201d  While the $5 billion that United expect to receive in government payroll support under the CARES Act bars its from involuntary furloughs before Sept. 30, the airline indicated that it expects to have to cut payroll after that. It said it will be offering new voluntary leave packages in the coming weeks and voluntary separation programs.  United said that the government money does not cover its total payroll expense, and noted that payroll is only about 30% of total costs, which also include airport rent and supplies.

The flight cancellations have weighed on airline profits and costs, but strong travel demand, despite concerns of a global economic slowdown, continued to offset MAX headwinds and disruption in Hong Kong and China.  As a result, United raised its 2019 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to $11.25-$12.25 versus $10.50-$12.00 previously.  United shares, which closed up 1% at $87.88 before the earnings release, were about 1% higher in after-hours trading.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The meeting between Trump and the CEOs of American Airlines AAL.O, United Airlines UAL.O, JetBlue Airways Corp JBLU.O, FedEx Corp FDX.N and Atlas Air AAWW.O included Vice President Mike Pence, the White House said.  The meeting also included the CEO of state-owned Qatar Airways, Akbar al-Baker, who was also at the White House last week to tout its decision in June to buy five new Boeing 777 freighters.  The White House did not immediately provide details of the meeting.  Since 2015 the largest U.S. carriers - Delta Air Lines DAL.N, American and United Airlines - have argued their Gulf rivals are being unfairly subsidized by their governments, distorting competition and costing U.S. jobs - something the Gulf carriers deny.  The Partnership for Open & Fair Skies, a group representing Delta, American, United and aviation unions, said it had a \u201cproductive meeting\u201d with Trump.  \u201cThe president shares our concerns and instructed us to keep working with the U.S. Department of Transportation, which we plan to do,\u201d Scott Reed, the group\u2019s managing partner, said in a statement.  The CEOs of JetBlue, FedEx and Atlas Air have warned that restricting the rights of Qatar Airways could lead to retaliation against U.S. carriers and added, in an April letter, it could lead to \u201ca rapid unraveling of hard-fought aviation rights around the world when other governments take similar action to shield their state-owned airlines from competition.\u201d  Last week, the CEOs of Delta, United and American wrote a joint USA Today op-ed urging the White House to act \u201cdecisively to hold Qatar and the UAE accountable.\u201d They suggested that failing to respond would \u201csignal to other countries that they too are free to exploit American workers.\u201d  In April, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the administration was scrutinizing Qatar Airways\u2019 acquisition of a 49% stake in Air Italy, which has been flying to U.S. destinations since 2018 in a move seen by U.S. lawmakers as flouting a deal not to add new flights to the domestic market.  Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have said they were concerned that the deal with the Italian carrier contravened an understanding Qatar Airways reached with the United States in early 2018.  Qatar Airways acquired the 49% of Italian airline Meridiana in 2017, rebranded it Air Italy and transformed it into a carrier with five announced nonstop U.S. destinations from Milan.  The Qatari government said in 2018 it was unaware of any plans to launch flights from Qatar to U.S. destinations via stops in Europe known as \u201cFifth Freedom\u201d flights.","62":"FILE PHOTO: United Airlines planes, including a Boeing 737 MAX 9 model, are pictured at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas, U.S., March 18, 2019.

An injunction would have required United, part of Chicago-based United Continental Holdings Inc, to provide Expedia with fare and schedule information for all its publicly available flights, including those after Sept. 30.  \u201cWe welcome the ruling from the judge in favor of United which will minimize the risk of disrupting our customers\u2019 travel plans and ensure we can effectively serve customers who need to make changes to their itineraries purchased through Expedia,\u201d United said in an emailed statement.  Expedia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The dispute came as some carriers try to reduce distribution costs by encouraging travelers to book directly rather than through online travel agencies such as Bellevue, Washington-based Expedia.  Southwest Airlines Co has long relied on direct bookings, and JetBlue Airways Corp in October 2017 pulled its fares from several online agencies.  Expedia accused United of trying to force a renegotiation of their 2011 contract by threatening to withhold fares for flights after Sept. 30, leaving it unable to book or change tickets.  United countered that limiting fare listings would benefit travelers flying later, because the companies\u2019 \u201ccoming divorce\u201d would leave Expedia unable to serve them.  In his decision, Castel found no language in the contract between Expedia and United suggesting that United would withhold fare information in the final months, and no evidence that Expedia would be unable to service customers through Sept. 30.  But he also found no proof that maintaining the \u201ccontractual status quo\u201d would irreparably harm Expedia, even if the dispute led to customer confusion and hurt its reputation.  Castel also said the public interest did not weigh in favor of a preliminary injunction.  \u201cThere is no serious issue as to the ability of members of the public to fly on their airline of their choosing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMeaningful and prominent disclosure will mitigate any harm to the public.\u201d  The case is Expedia Inc v United Airlines Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-01066.","65":"CHICAGO, April 17 (Reuters) - United Airlines expects Boeing Co\u2019s grounded 737 MAX jets to return to service this summer, with deliveries resuming before the end of the year, an executive said on Wednesday.  \u201cThe aircraft scheduled for delivery this year, we would expect to take this year,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Gerald Laderman said on a conference call.  Chicago-based United, which is part of United Continental Holdings Inc, owns 14 MAX aircraft and was due to take delivery this year of another 14 of the jets, which were grounded worldwide in March.  The groundings forced Boeing to freeze deliveries of the MAX, which had been its fastest-selling jetliner until a March 10 crash on Ethiopian Airlines that killed all 157 onboard, just five months after a similar crash on Lion Air that killed all 189 passengers and crew.  The bulk of United\u2019s 2019 MAX orders were scheduled for delivery before the start of the fourth quarter, though Laderman said he could see some of those deliveries slipping into the fourth quarter.  Global regulators must recertify the 737 MAX before it returns to service.

Avianca Brasil, which filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday after being sued for repossession of its jets, is owned by holding company Synergy Group, which also controls the better-known Avianca Holdings.  As part of a planned joint venture to give it a deeper foothold in Latin America, United extended a $456 million loan to Synergy last month, backed by Avianca common stock that can be executed in the event of a default.  Speaking to reporters on Wednesday about the airline\u2019s growth plans, Munoz said the loan was \u201cvery exacting\u201d in terms of how it had been structured and that Avianca Colombia had no connection to its Brazilian counterpart other than a common shareholder.  Under the loan contract with Synergy, United would receive first dibs on any offer that Synergy might receive on Avianca Holding common shares. The contract also spells out situations in which United would be the controlling shareholder of Avianca, and calls for a board seat if United reaches a 5 percent stake.","70":"CHICAGO, SAO PAULO (Reuters) - United Continental Holdings Inc UAL.O on Friday said it had finalized a three-way joint venture with carriers Avianca Holdings SA AVT_p.CN of Colombia and Copa Airlines of Panama, giving the U.S. airline a deeper foothold in Latin America where travel demand is rising.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Like its main U.S. rivals, No. 3 U.S. carrier United has been eyeing untapped potential for leisure and business travelers in Latin America, where many still travel long distances by car and bus.  United, Avianca and Copa are already codeshare partners and Star Alliance members, but a joint venture will allow them to plan routes and fares together and share revenues on those routes.  Shares in each of the three carriers ended higher on Friday.  Under the deal, United said it would provide a $456 million term loan to cash-strapped Avianca\u2019s top shareholder, Synergy Group Corp. Loss-making Avianca has a roughly $4 billion debt pile, of which 40 percent is due within the next two years, according to recent financial statements.  Latin American airlines in general have experienced a turbulent few years, hit by a double whammy of high oil prices and devaluing currencies in local markets, which make it more expensive to cover dollar-denominated costs like fuel and aircraft rent.  Travel has also suffered in the dominant regional economy Brazil, which has suffered from its deepest recession in decades but remains the largest aviation market in the region, and one of the biggest in the world.  United, which already owns an 8 percent stake in Brazilian carrier Azul SA, said it was exploring the possibility of adding the country to its joint partnership with Avianca and Copa.  The three carriers\u2019 agreement is subject to regulatory approval in the United States and several jurisdictions in Central and South America. Copa Airlines said in a press release that process would take between 12 and 18 months.  However, a similar deal between American Airlines Group AAL.O and Chile's Latam Airlines Group LTM.SN signed in January 2016 only received Chilean antitrust approval last month.

The decision follows comments from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that it still has nearly a dozen steps to complete before approving the jets for flight after a mid-March global safety ban in the wake of two fatal crashes. Reuters reported earlier U.S. officials do not expect the FAA to allow flights until at least February and it could slip to March.  Boeing said last week that it was freezing 737 production in January as the fallout from the two crashes, one in Indonesia and another in Ethiopia that killed a total 346 people, drags on.  Without the 737 MAX, United said it is cancelling about 56 flights a day in January and February, which tend to be slower travel months, with daily cancellations rising to 80 in March and April and 108 in May and the early part of June.  \u201cWith the MAX return to service date still unknown, pushing our timeline back to early June is what is best for our customers and our operation.

Airline shares had fallen this month after both Delta and American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O lowered estimates for fourth-quarter unit revenue, raising concerns about the industry's ability to raise fares in an uncertain global economy.  Chicago-based United attributed its revenue growth to a strategy launched last January to expand its domestic network by adding flights and more options for connections through its seven main hubs, with a particular focus on Chicago, Denver and Houston.

U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel said Expedia had shown a \u201clikelihood of success\u201d on the merits of its breach of contract claim, but did not show a preliminary injunction was needed to avoid irreparable harm or serve the public interest.  An injunction would have required United, part of Chicago-based United Continental Holdings Inc, to provide Expedia with fare and schedule information for all its publicly available flights, including those after Sept. 30.  Expedia did not immediately respond to requests for comment. United had no immediate comment.  The dispute came as some carriers try to reduce distribution costs by encouraging travelers to book directly rather than through online travel agencies such as Bellevue, Washington-based Expedia.  Southwest Airlines Co has long relied on direct bookings, and JetBlue Airways Corp in October 2017 pulled its fares from several online agencies.  Expedia accused United of trying to force a renegotiation of their 2011 contract by threatening to withhold fares for flights after Sept. 30, leaving it unable to book or change tickets.  United countered that limiting fare listings would benefit travelers flying later, because the companies\u2019 \u201ccoming divorce\u201d would leave Expedia unable to serve them.  In his decision, Castel found no language in the contract between Expedia and United suggesting that United would withhold fare information in the final months, and no evidence that Expedia would be unable to service customers through Sept. 30.  But he also found no proof that maintaining the \u201ccontractual status quo\u201d would irreparably harm Expedia, even if the dispute led to customer confusion and hurt its reputation.  Castel also said the public interest did not weigh in favor of a preliminary injunction.  \u201cThere is no serious issue as to the ability of members of the public to fly on their airline of their choosing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMeaningful and prominent disclosure will mitigate any harm to the public.\u201d  The case is Expedia Inc v United Airlines Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-01066.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) cited new satellite data and evidence from the scene of Sunday\u2019s crash near Addis Ababa for its decision to join Europe, China and other nations in suspending 737 MAX flights.  The crash was the second disaster involving the 737 MAX, the world\u2019s most-sold modern passenger aircraft, in less than five months.  GRAPHIC - Ethiopia Airlines crash location: tmsnrt.rs\/2CdCVUi  The new information from the wreckage in Ethiopia and newly refined data about the plane\u2019s flight path indicated some similarities between the two disasters \u201cthat warrant further investigation of the possibility of a shared cause,\u201d the FAA said in a statement.  The acting administrator of the FAA, Daniel Elwell, said he did not know how long the U.S. grounding of the aircraft would last. A software fix for the 737 Max that Boeing has been working on since a fatal crash last October in Indonesia will take months to complete, Elwell told reporters.  The single-aisle 737 is central to Boeing\u2019s future in its battle with European rival Airbus SE. The new variant of the 737, the fastest-selling jetliner in Boeing\u2019s history, is viewed as the likely workhorse for global airlines for decades.  \u201cThe agency made this decision as a result of the data gathering process and new evidence collected at the site and analyzed today,\u201d the FAA said, shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump announced the planes would be grounded.  GRAPHIC - Ethiopian airlines crash speed and altitude data: tmsnrt.rs\/2UAj5tW  It was the second time the FAA has halted flights of a Boeing plane in six years. It grounded the 787 Dreamliner in 2013 because of problems with smoking batteries.  Boeing, which maintained that its planes were safe to fly, said in a statement that it supported the latest FAA move.  \u201cBoeing has determined - out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public of the aircraft\u2019s safety - to recommend to the FAA the temporary suspension of operations of the entire global fleet of 371 737 MAX aircraft.\u201d  The crash involving a Boeing 737 MAX in Indonesia killed 189 people. Passengers have been spooked by the two disasters. U.S. travel website Kayak was making changes to let customers exclude specific aircraft types from searches, and booking sites were looking to reroute passengers.  GRAPHIC - Ethiopian Airlines crash plane and black boxes: tmsnrt.rs\/2ChjLNE  RE-BOOKING PASSENGERS  U.S. airlines that operate the 737 MAX, Southwest Airlines Co, American Airlines Group Inc and United Airlines, said they were working to re-book passengers. Southwest had 5 MAX-related cancellations on Wednesday and American nearly 40.  Southwest is the world\u2019s largest operator of the 737 MAX 8 with 34 jets.  Slideshow ( 18 images )  France\u2019s air accident investigation agency BEA will analyze black-box cockpit voice and data recorders from the crashed plane, a spokesman said.  The French announcement resolved uncertainty over the fate of the two recorders after Germany\u2019s BFU said it had declined a request to handle them because it could not process the new type of recorder used on the 737 MAX jets, in service since 2017.  Shares of the company ended up 0.5 percent at $377.14, recovering from a more than 3 percent fall in the afternoon when the FAA announcement was made.  The United States had held back on suspending 737 MAX flights on Tuesday even as many of the world\u2019s top economies such as China and European nations grounded the plane.  Slideshow ( 18 images )  Trump called Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg on Wednesday to inform him that the United States was preparing to ground the fleet, a White House official said.  \u201cI spoke with a number of airlines. And speaking to the airlines, I think that we all agree that this was right decision to make. It didn\u2019t have to be made, but we thought it was the right decision to make,\u201d Trump told reporters.  The grounding was welcomed by air workers in the United States. John Samuelsen, international president of the Transport Workers Union of America, which represents aviation workers and flight attendants, said the grounding of the fleet was right \u201cboth for air travelers and aviation workers.\u201d  GRAPHIC - Boeing shares hit after Ethiopia jet crash: tmsnrt.rs\/2Ca96E7  NEW SATELLITE DATA  Canada also grounded 737 MAX jets on Wednesday, saying satellite data suggested similarities to the previous crash involving the same plane model in October.  U.S.-based aircraft-tracking firm Aireon provided the satellite data to the FAA, Transport Canada and several other authorities, company spokeswoman Jessie Hillenbrand said.  Ethiopian Airlines spokesman Asrat Begashaw said it was still unclear what happened on Sunday, but its pilot had reported control issues as opposed to external factors such as birds.  \u201cThe pilot reported flight control problems and requested to turn back. In fact he was allowed to turn back,\u201d he said.  Brazil, Mexico and Panama on Wednesday became the first Latin American nations to suspend the Boeing 737 MAX. Earlier, Panama\u2019s Copa Airlines had suspended operations of its six Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft until the findings are published of an investigation into Sunday\u2019s crash.  The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Democrat Peter DeFazio, called for a probe into why the 737 MAX received certification to fly.

Of 12 new slots agreed with Japan, the DOT has tentatively allocated five for Delta, four for United, two for American Airlines Group Inc and one for Hawaiian Airlines.  The extra slots for U.S. airlines, which are still pending final government approvals, were unlocked after Japan reached an agreement with the U.S. Air Force to open up new flight paths around a nearby U.S. air base, a move needed to boost Haneda movements in the run-up to the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.

The grounding of Boeing Co\u2019s fuel-efficient, single-aisle workhorse after two fatal crashes is biting into U.S. airlines\u2019 Northern Hemisphere spring and summer schedules, threatening to disarm them in their seasonal war for profits.  \u201cThe revenue is right in front of them. They can see it, but they can\u2019t meet it,\u201d said Mike Trevino, spokesman for Southwest Airlines Pilots Association and an aviation industry veteran.  Southwest Airlines Co, the world\u2019s largest MAX operator, and American Airlines Group Inc with 34 and 24 MAX jetliners respectively, have removed the aircraft from their flying schedules into August. United Airlines said on Monday it would remove its 14 MAX jets through early July.  Southwest\u2019s decision will lead to 160 cancellations of some 4,200 daily flights between June 8 and Aug. 5, while American\u2019s removal through Aug. 19 means about 115 daily cancellations, or 1.5 percent of its summer flying schedule each day.  Low-cost carrier Southwest, which unlike its rivals only flies Boeing 737s, had estimated $150 million in lost revenue between Feb. 20 and March 31 alone due to MAX cancellations and other factors.  So far airlines have said it is too soon to estimate the impact of the MAX grounding beyond the first quarter, but the extended cancellations signal that they do not expect a quick return of Boeing\u2019s fast-selling jetliner. The 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March following a fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash just five months after a Lion Air crash in Indonesia. All on board both planes were killed.  FILE PHOTO: A number of grounded Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft are shown parked at Victorville Airport in Victorville, California, U.S., March 26, 2019. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Boeing is under pressure to deliver an upgrade on software that is under scrutiny in both crashes and convince global regulators that the plane is safe to fly again, a process expected to take at least 90 days.  The timing of a prolonged grounding could not be worse for Northern Hemisphere carriers. Planes run fullest during June, July and August, when airlines earn the most revenue per available seat mile, according to U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics.  In a letter to employees and customers on Sunday, American Airlines\u2019 top executives said they believed the MAX would be recertified \u201csoon\u201d but wanted to provide their customers reliability and confidence during \u201cthe busiest travel period of the year.\u201d  American was cancelling about 90 flights per day through early June, but runs more flights and has less fleet flexibility in the peak summer travel months.  \u201cWe\u2019re not denying that it\u2019s going to be a challenge for us,\u201d American spokesman Ross Feinstein said. \u201cThat is why if we have to extend cancellations based on aircraft availability we will do so as far in advance as possible.\u201d  A decline in seat capacity could mean higher last-minute summer fares, particularly for business class travelers, aviation consultants and analysts said.  United has largely avoided cancellations by servicing MAX routes with larger 777 or 787 aircraft, but the airline president, Scott Kirby, warned last week that the strategy was costing it money and could not go on forever.  \u201cWe\u2019ve used spare aircraft and other creative solutions to help our customers, who had been scheduled to travel on one of our 14 MAX aircraft, get where they are going. But, it\u2019s harder to make those changes at the peak of the busy summer travel season,\u201d United said on Monday.  Overall the MAX represents just 5 percent of Southwest\u2019s total fleet and even less for American and United, but the strain on fleets increases as additional MAX deliveries remain frozen.  Southwest has 41 MAX jets pending delivery for 2019, while American has 16 and United 14. They are each working with Boeing and regulators to ensure the aircraft\u2019s safety before flying it with customers and employees.  Meanwhile, operators have added a flight or two to other aircrafts\u2019 daily schedules and deferred some non-essential maintenance work. Some airlines are also weighing extending aircraft leases and bringing back idled planes, but with unclear MAX timing, no option is clear-cut or cheap, consultants said.  United is due to publish first-quarter results on April 16, followed by Southwest on April 25 and American on April 26.","99":"United Airlines Inc on Wednesday was hit with a lawsuit by a man who claims he suffered bodily injuries and emotional distress from a 2018 emergency landing caused by the negligence of a plane mechanic.

So far there has been no talk of a full bailout like that of the auto-industry in 2009.

Delta, the second-largest U.S. airline, will be flying just five flights a day to Europe starting this week, compared with 92 last year to 31 European destinations at the peak travel season.  Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in a memo to employees Friday the \u201cspeed of the demand fall-off is unlike anything we\u2019ve seen... We are moving quickly to preserve cash and protect our company. And with revenues dropping, we must be focused on taking costs out of our business.\u201d  American said Saturday it would cancel 75% of its international flights and ground nearly all its widebody jets.

Reuters reported in May that Airbus was lagging behind Boeing in an effort to place its A330neo at United, which sets the tone for fleet decisions worldwide, and win a high-profile endorsement of its slow-selling jet.  United\u2019s expanded transcontinental routes are part of the third largest U.S. air carrier\u2019s plans to increase its overall capacity by around 4.5 percent to 5 percent this year, a faster pace than other airlines in the industry.  Under the plan announced on Monday, United will add more than 700 daily seats and 125 premium seats on 27 daily flights between New York\/Newark and Los Angeles and San Francisco, thanks to an extra daily flight and the use of more widebodies on those roundtrip routes.  For example, some of the coast-to-coast flights will be serviced by its new and larger 787-10 Dreamliner jets beginning early next year.  As for the 787-9 order, United said it expects to take delivery in 2020 of the new aircraft, which will be used to replace older widebody aircraft.  In a separate statement, Boeing said nearly half of all 787 customers have returned to place additional orders for Dreamliner models, which can fly farther and use 20 percent less fuel with 20 percent fewer emissions than older widebody aircraft.

To address a tight U.S. labor market created by years of slow pilot hiring, a wave of pending retirements and new rules that in 2013 increased the number of required training hours, U.S. airlines have been taking steps to attract young aviators.  Chicago-based United, which is looking to hire more than 10,000 pilots by 2029, will be the first major U.S. carrier to run its own academy.  \u201cWe think this program will alleviate any shortage we would have had and that\u2019s its purpose,\u201d Curtis Brunjes, United\u2019s managing director of pilot strategy, told reporters.  The school, currently operating as Westwind School of Aeronautics, will be renamed United Aviate Academy in September.  United expects approximately 300 graduates in 2021 and wants to expand capacity to accommodate 500 graduates per year, Brunjes said, noting that the academy is among the airline\u2019s most aggressive steps on pilot hiring since the 1960s.  One area of focus at the school will be training for loss of control incidents, a leading cause of plane disasters, that goes beyond the current U.S. Federal Aviation Administration requirements.  Some of the enrollees will come from Aviate, a recruitment program that United launched last year offering students and pilots from 15 schools and regional carriers a path to a job at the major.  American Airlines Group Inc and Delta Air lines Inc have similar career programs.  United - which plans to design the academy\u2019s curriculum in concert with the Air Line Pilots Association, International - is offering financing options for training and will also launch a scholarship program focused on women and minorities.  It did not disclose financial details of the purchase, with Brunjes saying only that the company paid \u201cmore than asset value, but not hugely more.\u201d  The financial benefit down the line will be ensuring that regional carriers, which operate a significant amount of U.S. airlines\u2019 domestic capacity at a lower cost, have enough pilots to fly the routes that United wants to contract.  In recent years, regional carriers have had to double salaries and offer sign-on bonuses to attract pilots to the field, driving up costs.

While the industrial sector .SPLRCI represents slightly less than 10% of the overall S&P 500 .SPX stock index, it can provide an outsized perspective on the economy. It includes major multi-national manufacturers as well as transportation companies whose results offer a barometer of economic activity.  The industrial stock sector has climbed over 19% this year, slightly ahead of the 18.5% gain for the overall S&P 500 .SPX. But while the broader market has hit all-time highs this year, the industrial sector has yet to breach its record peak from early 2018 and currently trades about 5% below it.  Industrial results start pouring in this week, including from diversified manufacturers Honeywell International Inc HON.N and Textron Inc TXT.N, railroads Union Pacific Corp UNP.N and CSX Corp CSX.O, and United Airlines Holdings Inc UAL.O.  Third-quarter earnings overall for industrial companies are expected to rise by just 0.7% from a year earlier, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. That would represent a better performance than for the full S&P 500 .SPX, for which earnings are expected to fall by 3.2%.

Earnings in 2020 in the industrials sector are forecast to jump 16.2%, while the overall S&P 500 is seen rising 11.1%, according to Refinitiv.  Expectations for a sharp increase in overall earnings next year rests in part on the economy avoiding a recession, said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer of equities and multi-asset strategies at Charles Schwab Investment Management in San Francisco.  For industrial companies, Aguilar said, a critical factor is whether they ramp up capital spending, which could depend on U.S.-China trade tensions yielding a clearer picture of the business environment.  \u201cThe majority of these companies stopped their capital expenditures as a result of uncertainties because of the U.S.-China negotiations,\u201d Aguilar said. A rebound in capital spending could help restore earnings growth, he added.  U.S. and Chinese officials culminated talks in Washington last week with U.S. President Donald Trump outlining the first phase of a deal to end their trade war, including suspending a threatened tariff hike.  But officials on both sides said much more work was still needed to reach a final comprehensive agreement, and Trump left tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese products in place.  Carol Schleif, deputy chief investment officer with Abbot Downing in Minneapolis, said that Friday\u2019s developments show some movement in the U.S.-China trade tensions, but uncertainty remains for companies.  As the industrial companies hold their quarterly conference calls, Schleif said she will be listening for commentary about the impact that has already been felt from the trade war, including whether companies have pulled shipments in to get ahead of tariffs, or if have they deferred capital spending or employment.  \u201cCompanies are being forced to reassess their supply chains, and that takes time. To the extent companies are making progress on diversifying that, it might lead to a muddy couple of quarters,\u201d Schleif said. \u201cYou have a lot of pieces at play that make it tough to be an industrial company right now.\u201d  (GRAPHIC: Industrial shares vs stock market - )","115":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines said on Wednesday it was adding 1,600 premium seats to nearly 250 international and domestic aircraft, including the introduction of a first-class cabin on 50 Bombardier Inc regional jets.  The move is part of a push by large U.S. airlines to attract more lucrative premium travelers. Rivals Delta Air Lines Inc and American Airlines Group Inc have also added premium seats, which can fetch at least twice the coach fare.  United\u2019s new regional jet, called the CRJ 550, will be the only 50-seater on the market to offer a first class cabin, the Chicago-based airline said, providing premium travel on connecting flights from small U.S. cities to the rest of the world.  Under the plan, United will work with Bombardier to use the frame of its current CRJ 70-seat fleet for a new two-cabin, 50-seat configuration with a self-serve beverage and snack station for premium travelers and four storage closets for carry-on bags.  The CRJ 550s will eventually replace United\u2019s current 50-seat regional fleet with a model permitted under its pilots\u2019 contract, which became amenable in January.  While not generating new orders for cash-strapped Bombardier, United\u2019s plan would allow the Canadian plane and train maker to market the new model to other U.S. airlines looking to replace aging regional jets. Bombardier aims to take a decision on its money-losing CRJ regional jet program this year.

The FAA said on Tuesday it is calling back 1,700 aviation safety inspectors, but does not have immediate plans to recall employees who handle certifications of new aircraft.  \u201cThere continues to be growing concerns around the macro environment with the government shutdown and slowing economies in Europe and Asia,\u201d Cowen and Company analyst Helane Becker said.  Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian said the shutdown will cost about $25 million per month due to reduced government travel and related effects. He said the company has not seen any impact on corporate travel or bookings, which overall look healthy through the U.S. spring break period.  Delta operates about 86 daily flights out of Washington area airports.  United, with a hub at Washington Dulles, could be more exposed to a prolonged shutdown, operating about 264 Washington area flights per day in January.  Chicago-based United also warned that revenue per mile flown could fall in the first quarter. Its management will discuss earnings and forecasts on a conference call on Wednesday.  In the fourth quarter, United\u2019s adjusted earnings per share rose to $2.41 from $1.99 a year earlier, topping analysts\u2019 average forecast by 37 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  United attributed fourth-quarter growth to a strategy launched last January to expand its domestic network by adding flights and more options for connections through its seven main hubs, with a particular focus on Chicago, Denver and Houston.  Delta reported adjusted profit of $1.30 per share for the fourth quarter, beating analysts\u2019 estimates by 3 cents.  Delta also forecast first-quarter earnings between 70 cents and 90 cents per share, while United said it expects full-year adjusted earnings of $10.00 to $12.00 per share.","118":"SINGAPORE, May 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) reputation has taken a hit as a result of the Boeing Co 737 MAX grounding, United Airlines President Scott Kirby said on Monday.  \u201cThe brand of the FAA has certainly been impacted by this,\u201d he said at the Skift Forum Asia conference in Singapore.  However, he said the regulatory system in the United States and elsewhere was likely to emerge stronger as a result of the 737 MAX grounding experience.

There were 28 passengers and three crew members on board CommutAir flight 4933 flying from Newark to Presque Isle, the company said.  The Ohio-based regional carrier, in which No.3 U.S. airline operator United Continental Holdings Inc owns a minority interest, said the injuries of the crew and the passengers were minor and they were being attended to by emergency personnel.  \u201cWe are committed to supporting CommutAir in response to this incident and have activated a response team,\u201d United said in a statement.

Picture taken July 1, 2019. REUTERS\/Lindsey Wasson  The decision had been expected after Boeing said on June 27 it would likely take until at least September to fix a fresh flaw in the grounded 737 MAX discovered by the Federal Aviation Administration last month.  United had previously left its 14 737 MAX jets off its flight schedule through early September.  The new potential risk must be addressed before the aircraft can return to service since two deadly crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia led to its worldwide grounding in March.  Once regulators approve the MAX for flight, each aircraft will likely require between 100 and 150 hours of maintenance preparation before flying, in addition to new pilot training, airline officials have said.  Among other U.S. MAX operators, Southwest Airlines Co so far has canceled flights through Oct. 1 and American Airlines Group through Sept. 3, though those timelines are also likely to be extended.  While the three U.S. airlines\u2019 MAX jets account for only a fraction of their entire fleet, the grounding has forced about 150 daily flight cancellations for Southwest and 115 for American.  United is due on Tuesday to publish second-quarter results, which investors are hoping will provide details on the financial impact of the grounding.  Unit revenues, based on per available seat mile, could benefit as planes fly with more passengers. But the longer the grounding lasts, the more strain on airlines counting on fresh deliveries of the fuel-efficient MAX this year to renew and expand their fleets.  United, for example, was expecting a total of 30 MAX jets by year-end, meaning that its daily flight cancellations are increasing for every month that the aircraft is grounded.  Deliveries remain frozen until regulators approve the MAX\u2019s return to service.  Some analysts do not expect the jet to fly commercially before the end of the year.  \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to monitor the regulatory process and nimbly make the necessary adjustments to our operation and our schedule,\u201d United said in a statement.  The 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March after an Ethiopian Airlines plane plunged to the ground soon after take-off, five months after a similar Lion Air fatal crash off the coast of Indonesia.  Boeing hopes a software upgrade and new pilot training will add layers of protection to prevent erroneous data from triggering a system called MCAS, which was activated in both the planes before they crashed."}}
