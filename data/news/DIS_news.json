ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co DIS.N said on Wednesday it had created a new unit for its streaming video and international businesses as the company retools its traditional media operation for a world rapidly embracing online video.  A screen shows the logo and a ticker symbol for The Walt Disney Company on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., December 14, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Kevin Mayer, the company\u2019s chief strategy officer, was named chairman of the new division, which will oversee the upcoming ESPN+ digital offering and the launch of a family-oriented streaming service in late 2019, Disney said in a statement.  The move, effective immediately, comes as Disney is in the process of purchasing film, TV and international businesses from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOXA.O.  Regulators are reviewing the deal, which has been complicated by Comcast Corp's CMCSA.O offer for one of the assets, Britain's Sky Plc SKYB.L.  Disney also combined its theme parks business with the consumer products unit that licenses characters for toys, apparel and other merchandise. Bob Chapek, who heads the parks division, will lead the combined unit.  Media networks and the movie studio will remain separate units, Disney said.  \u201cWe are strategically positioning our businesses for the future, creating a more effective, global framework to serve consumers worldwide, increase growth, and maximize shareholder value,\u201d Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said in a statement.  Disney's largest TV network, ESPN, has been losing subscribers as customers drop pay television subscriptions in favor of streaming services such as Netflix Inc NFLX.O.  The company is responding with its own digital push. It is pulling its first-run movies from Netflix in 2019 to offer them on the Disney-branded service.  If the Fox deal wins approval, Disney also will expand its programming portfolio and international reach, plus own a majority stake in the Hulu streaming service.  Disney expects to switch its financial reporting to reflect the new structure by the beginning of fiscal 2019, the company said.  Shares of Disney rose 0.5 percent to $104.33 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.","1":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of the Walt Disney Company is displayed above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the closing bell as the market takes a significant dip in New York, U.S., February 25, 2020. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co DIS.N said on Thursday the spread of the coronavirus could lead to consumer behavior changes, further disrupting its business.  The warning raised speculation that media and entertainment businesses could change in fundamental ways.  The company has already closed its theme parks, suspended cruises and theatrical shows, delayed film distribution, and taken a hit to its supply chain and ad sales.  Long-term changes in consumer behavior could include lower attendance at movie theaters and parks, more subscribers to its Disney+ streaming service, and fewer viewers of live TV.  In its filing, Disney cited disruption in the creation and availability of content, including the cancellation of certain sports events and the shutting down of most film and TV production.  The effect of the coronavirus on capital markets could affect borrowing costs, Disney added.  Moody\u2019s said on Tuesday it expected Disney\u2019s park closures and cruise ship suspensions to be temporary, hurting margins and adding to the $175 million operating income hit taken by its parks, experiences and products division due to park closures in China.  Shares of Disney rose 6% to $93.79 shortly after midday.","2":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co's DIS.N $52.4 billion deal to acquire most of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's FOXA.O assets was \"surgically\" structured on good advice to be submitted to regulators, Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general for the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust division, said on Thursday.  \u201cWe will see what the investigation shows. (Disney) didn\u2019t propose to acquire Fox Sports 1 and 2. They didn\u2019t acquire Fox Broadcasting and say, you know what, we will combine this with ABC and don\u2019t worry about it we\u2019ll have an arbitrator decide if prices for advertisers go up or competition for content creators goes down,\u201d Delrahim told The Deal\u2019s annual corporate governance conference in New York.  \u201cThey had good advice and carved out surgically ... a transaction that might be doable. But again, who knows where that transaction leads,\u201d Delrahim added.  Antitrust considerations have become especially important as Fox prepares to weigh a rival offer for the assets Disney agreed to buy last December. Comcast Corp CMCSA.O said last month it was preparing an offer for the Fox assets that would top the deal with Disney.  A regulatory filing in April showed that Comcast offered to acquire Fox\u2019s assets for $64 billion last November, before it agreed to sell to Disney. Fox rejected Comcast\u2019s offer, even though it was higher, partly because it was concerned it faced a greater risk of regulators shooting it down.  Comcast is waiting to see if a U.S. federal judge will allow AT&T Inc's T.N planned $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc TWX.N to proceed before submitting its new offer to Fox, sources have said.

Last year Shanghai Disney had to stop selling tickets to visitors as the park got overcrowded.  \u201cIn response to the prevention and control of the disease outbreak and in order to ensure the health and safety of our guests and Cast, Shanghai Disney Resort is temporarily closing Shanghai Disneyland, Disneytown ... starting Jan. 25,\u201d the company said on its website.  \u201cWe will continue to carefully monitor the situation and ... announce the reopening date upon confirmation.\u201d  Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, and neighbouring Huanggang, a city of about 7 million people, were in virtual lockdown, with restrictions in place elsewhere. A new coronavirus which broke out in Wuhan, central China, late last year has killed 25 people and infected more than 800.  Many businesses including retailers, airlines, travel agencies and hotel operators are on high alert, as health authorities fear the infection rate could accelerate over the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions of Chinese travel at home and abroad.  The outbreak has already prompted seven Chinese films that were set to premiere during the holiday to postpone screenings, forgoing what is usually the best week of the year at the Chinese box office.  Disney said it would refund tickets for admission to Shanghai Disneyland, on China\u2019s east coast, more than 800 km from Wuhan, or other services at the park as well as hotel bookings.  The estimated financial impact on the U.S. company\u2019s first theme park in mainland China, which opened in mid-2016 in its largest overseas investment at $5.5 billion, was not immediately clear.  The company was not immediately available to comment.  Shanghai Disney carried out a resort-wide makeover this month for a four-week event through Feb. 9 to celebrate the Year of the Rat with its characters including Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse and target China\u2019s middle class and booming domestic tourism.  Walt Disney Co owns a 43% stake in Shanghai Disney Resort which has Shanghai Disneyland theme park and two hotels with a total of 1,220 rooms.  The impact on businesses is set to increase as China discourages locals from gathering in crowded places. It has already stepped up measures to contain the virus, with public transport suspensions in 10 cities, the shutting of temples and closing the Forbidden City, Beijing\u2019s most famous tourist attraction.  Japan\u2019s Fast Retailing Co Ltd said on Friday it has temporarily closed 17 Uniqlo stores in Wuhan. China is a key growth market for the company which faces a saturated market and weak consumer spending in Japan.

Slideshow ( 4 images )  The announcement came two days after Disney reopened its biggest resort, Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, as coronavirus cases surged in the state.  \u201cAs required by the government and health authorities in line with prevention efforts taking place across Hong Kong, Hong Kong Disneyland park will temporarily close from July 15,\u201d a Disney spokeswoman said in a statement.  The Hong Kong Disneyland Resort hotels will remain open with adjusted services. They have put in place enhanced health and safety measures, the company said.  Hong Kong recorded 52 new cases of coronavirus on Monday, including 41 that were locally transmitted, according to health authorities. Since late January, Hong Kong has reported 1,522 cases and local media reported an eighth death on Monday.  Florida has emerged as an epicenter of U.S. COVID-19 infections. In Orange County, where Disney World is located, cases rose by 623 to a total of 18,624, the fifth-highest outbreak in the state.  Hong Kong is tightening social distancing measures amid growing worries about a third wave of coronavirus infections. The government will limit group gatherings to four people - from 50 - a measure last seen during a second wave of the outbreak in March.  Hong Kong Disneyland, which is majority-owned (53%) by the Hong Kong government, reopened in June. Hong Kong Tokyo reopened in July; Disneyland Shanghai reopened in May.  Disney\u2019s reopening of its parks in Asia helped provide assurance about moving ahead in Florida, Josh D\u2019Amaro, chairman of Disney\u2019s parks, experiences and products division told Reuters in an interview on Saturday.  David Miller, an analyst at investment bank Imperial Capital, estimates that Disney generates 75% of operating income in its parks division from Walt Disney World, compared with 10% from all of the foreign parks combined.","6":"SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Quarterly reports next week from Walt Disney Co, CBS and Viacom will likely highlight increasing competition in video streaming and could spark volatility in the so-called communication services sector, which has outperformed since it was overhauled last year.  The S&P 500 communication services index has increased 20% so far in 2019, beating the S&P 500\u2019s 17% gain and all but two of 11 sectors - technology and real estate. That strong performance is in large part thanks to a recovery by Facebook Inc, as investors bet that the world\u2019s largest social network will keep growing, even as it faces regulatory hurdles.  June-quarter results from Disney, CBS Corp and Viacom Inc will keep investors fixated on a rising wave of competition in video streaming against market leader Netflix Inc. All those companies fall within the communication services sector.  Netflix\u2019s stock has sunk 14% since it reported on July 17 that it unexpectedly lost U.S. subscribers in the second quarter, rattling investors already worried about the upcoming launch of Disney\u2019s streaming service.  Disney\u2019s family-friendly Disney+, set to launch on Nov. 12 with a slate of new and classic TV shows and movies, is viewed as the most dangerous threat to Netflix. Disney\u2019s shares hit a record high on Monday and have surged 28% this year.  \u201cThere is an analysis that has been going on among investors, looking at the number of subscribers Netflix has and the growth that Disney\u2019s service could put up in the next three or four years, and the huge disparity in the two companies\u2019 valuations,\u201d said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.  The recent increase in Disney\u2019s shares and decline in Netflix\u2019s shows that investors expect Disney to significantly dent Netflix\u2019s leadership in streaming, Carlson said.  Disney\u2019s stock is trading at 22 times expected earnings, its highest forward earnings valuation since 2004, according to Refinitiv data. Netflix\u2019s forward earnings valuation has dipped to 66 from 82 in early July, before its disappointing quarterly report.  Smaller players CBS and sister company Viacom have also built advertising-supported and subscription video services to compete with Netflix, and they are providing original content to other distributors.  Beyond streaming, investors watching Disney\u2019s report on Tuesday will focus on its recent run of box office hits, including \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d which has increased Disney\u2019s lead position at the U.S. box office. Disney owns the five-highest grossing movies of 2019, led by \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d and \u201cCaptain Marvel.\u201d  \u201cThe Netflix disappointment and the big Disney box office numbers underscore the importance of intellectual property, of ownership of content,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. Even though Netflix makes many of its own shows, it still relies on other producers, he said.  Netflix is losing its two most-watched shows in the United States - \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cThe Office\u201d - to upcoming rival services from AT&T Inc and NBC Universal in 2020 and 2021, respectively.  Viacom and CBS, both controlled by the Redstone family\u2019s National Amusements Inc, have worked out a management structure that would see Viacom Chief Executive Officer Robert Bakish leading the combined company if a merger deal is reached, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday, removing a major roadblock in talks to recombine the corporations.  In addition to looking for potential confirmation of that deal when CBS and Viacom report their results on Thursday, investors will focus on growth in CBS\u2019s All Access and Showtime streaming services.  Viacom could also give details about its strategy to sell programming to video streaming services, including its Paramount Television unit\u2019s \u201cJack Ryan\u201d TV series, based on the character created by author Tom Clancy, which premiered last year on Amazon Prime.  Long viewed as stodgy stocks for dividend-oriented investors, the telecom services sector was renamed communication services last September and supercharged with internet heavyweights Alphabet Inc, Facebook, Netflix and Twitter Inc, along with videogame makers. It was the biggest shakeup of the Global Industry Classification Standard, or GICS, since it was created in 1999. It has gained 5% since then, while the S&P 500 is unchanged over the same period.  CBS and Viacom have both gained about 15% in 2019.  Helped by its $71 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox\u2019s assets, Disney is expected by analysts to report a 41% jump in fiscal third-quarter revenue to $21.5 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Analysts on average expect earnings per share of $1.75. Disney\u2019s EPS has met or exceeded consensus estimates in six of the past eight quarters.  \u201cMy guess is the company will want to focus on content and investors will want to hear more about the streaming strategy,\u201d Ablin said.","7":"FILE PHOTO: Silhouettes of mobile users are seen next to a screen projection of the Facebook logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018.

At Disney DIS.N, about two-thirds of the employees facing layoffs are part-time workers, the company said in a statement. The company's original theme park, Disneyland, remains closed by order of California state officials.

In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city will fine residents or visitors up to $1,000 if they refuse to wear a mask in public. The rate of positive COVID-19 tests has risen above 3% in New York City for the first time in months.  \u201cWe don\u2019t want to fine people, but if we have to, we will,\u201d de Blasio said at a news conference announcing the penalty, which will be enforced by police and health officials who will offer a mask to those caught not wearing one before fining them.  The state-controlled Metropolitan Transportation Authority imposed a similar policy earlier this month, fining commuters who refuse to wear a mask on public transit $50.  STUDENTS RETURN TO NYC SCHOOLS  De Blasio\u2019s announcement came as many students returned to New York City public elementary schools for the first time on Tuesday, part of an effort to provide a mix of in-person and virtual learning that had twice been delayed amid opposition by teachers unions.  The city has said it will shut schools again if the seven-day average reaches 3% or more.  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who has boasted of his state\u2019s success in reducing transmission of the virus, on Tuesday warned that he might ban indoor dining again or bring back other restrictions, although he said such moves were not yet warranted.  \u201c(But) if the local governments do not do the compliance and attack the clusters, you will be there in the short-term future.\u201d  Cuomo has bickered with de Blasio over who has the authority to clamp down further on residents and businesses. The governor said he would meet with leaders of Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn as well as Nassau, Orange and Rockland counties, where infections have ticked up.  Rabbi Asher Bush, who leads the Orthodox Jewish Congregation Ahavat Yisrael in Rockland County, said some synagogues have been more strict than others, particularly as infection rates waned during the summer months.  \u201cThere is a very large gamut of how different congregations are conducting themselves,\u201d he told Reuters in a telephone interview, adding that his congregation was being very careful by enforcing social distancing and mask-wearing.  Beyond New York state, 28 other states were seeing upticks in new coronavirus infections over the past two weeks, and COVID-19 hospitalizations were on the rise in several Midwestern states.  Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin have all reported record numbers of hospitalized patients in the past seven days. On Monday, North Dakota reported 105 hospitalizations and Wisconsin 640.  The Tennessee Titans and Minnesota Vikings professional football teams suspended activities after some members of the Titans tested positive for COVID-19 following a game on Sunday, according to statements from the National Football League and the teams.","10":"FILE PHOTO - 90th Academy Awards - Oscars Show \u2013 Hollywood, California, U.S., 04\/03\/2018 \u2013 Disney CEO Robert Iger awaits the start of the show. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co DIS.N said on Monday Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger has agreed to certain adjustments to his compensation package, which ties his paycheck to the company's performance, as it nears the completion of its Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA.O acquisition.  Under the new agreement, Iger will earn no shares if the company\u2019s relative total shareholder return is less than or equal to 25 percentile of the total shareholder return of companies in the S&P 500 index.  He will get the full target amount of 937,599 shares only if the company outperforms the bottom 65 percent of firms on the same index, the company said in a regulatory filing here.  The amended deal comes after Disney shareholders challenged Iger\u2019s pay earlier this year. They were worried about overpaying the CEO, who stood to earn up to $423 million over four years, and that his performance targets were too low.  \u201cIn line with the Disney Board\u2019s pay-for-performance philosophy, the amendments to Mr. Iger\u2019s contract establish more rigorous performance requirements for his equity award than those reflected in the original contract,\u201d a spokesperson of Walt Disney said.  Under the previous compensation package, Iger was being paid up to $48.5 million in annual salary and bonuses following the Fox deal closure for each of the four years from 2018-2021.

The complaint also said Fox issued a default notice in a manner consistent with Disney wanting to \u201ckill the deal.\u201d  Twentieth Century Fox Film, one of the defendants, rejected that allegation. \u201cThe allegation that Disney, rather than Fox, finally decided to declare a default is simply made up,\u201d a spokesman said.

Set to open in local theatres on Friday, Disney DIS.N had high hopes for Mulan in China, but starving it of publicity in the country's strictly censored media would be another blow to the $200 million production.  Starring big-name Chinese-born actors - Jet Li, Gong Li, Donnie Yen and Liu Yifei - and based on a Chinese folk story, Mulan was tailored to appeal to audiences in China, the world\u2019s second-largest movie market.  But mixed reviews online and capacity limits in theatres due to coronavirus prevention measures were likely to weigh on its box office performance, even before major media outlets received a notice telling them to refrain from covering the movie.  Three sources told Reuters media outlets had received the notice, two of whom said it was sent by the Cyberspace Administration of China. A fourth source at a major Chinese newspaper said he received a text message with a similar order from a senior colleague.  No reason was given in the notice, but the sources said they believed it was because of the overseas backlash over the film\u2019s links to Xinjiang.  Neither the Cyberspace Administration or Disney immediately responded to requests for comment.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Partly shot in Xinjiang, Mulan\u2019s credits included thanks to the authorities there, which prompted calls overseas for a boycott of the movie. China\u2019s clampdown on ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang has been criticised by some governments, including the United States, and human rights groups.  On Wednesday, the Global Times, a tabloid run by the ruling Communist Party\u2019s People\u2019s Daily, criticised the backlash against the movie in an editorial in its English edition, describing it as \u201canother manifestation of the extreme ideologies regarding China among US public opinion.\u201d  Disney had worked to ensure Mulan tested well with Chinese audiences, and the company\u2019s chief financial officer told investors on Wednesday that it was \u201cvery pleased\u201d with the initial results of its release elsewhere.  The movie was released on Disney\u2019s streaming service in many markets, rather than in cinemas, due to the COVID-19 outbreak.  Mulan is likely to be shown on more than 40% of China\u2019s screens on Friday, according to data from Maoyan, a Tencent-backed ticketing platform. Chinese theatres are currently limiting capacity, typically at 50 percent.  The film had sold 9.78 million yuan ($1.43 million) worth of tickets as of Thursday afternoon, accounting for 55% of all ticket sales sold across China for Friday\u2019s shows.  One analyst, who declined to be named because he said the situation is sensitive, predicted the film would earn a dismal 150 million yuan at mainland box offices, given early audience reviews.  The film, which many have already seen online, has received a 4.7 score out of 10 on popular social media site Douban, where users leave reviews of films, books and music.

The Fox board also recommended backing the deal but said that it was aware of Comcast Corp's CMCSA.O moves to make an offer for certain assets of the company.  Comcast said last week it was preparing a higher, all-cash offer for most of the media assets of Fox, but sources say it will only proceed if a federal judge next month allows AT&T Inc's T.N planned $85-billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc TWX.N.  The announcement of the special meeting date comes after the largest U.S. cable operator Comcast put pressure on Fox and its shareholders to not rush into approving the Disney deal by going public with its plans of a \u201csuperior\u201d offer.  Disney in December offered stock then worth $52.4 billion to buy Fox's film, television and international businesses to beef up its offering against streaming rivals Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.  A regulatory filing in April showed Comcast offered to buy most of Fox\u2019s assets in an all-stock deal valued at $34.41 per share, or $64 billion last November, just before Disney\u2019s offer was agreed upon.","31":"(Repeats for wider distribution.)  June 20 (Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc\u2019s board is set to decide on Wednesday whether to entertain Comcast Corp\u2019s $65 billion cash bid for the New York-based media company or stick with its roughly $52 billion all-stock offer from Walt Disney Co, people familiar with the matter said.  Disney and Comcast are battling to win Fox\u2019s movie and television studios at a time when legacy media and distribution companies are looking to expand to better compete with younger media firms like Netflix Inc that sell their content directly to viewers. Fox\u2019s international assets such as Star India appeal to both Disney and Comcast, which want to expand their global presence.  While Fox\u2019s board has yet to make a decision, analysts and industry dealmakers widely expect Fox to say that Comcast\u2019s bid could potentially lead to a better deal for its shareholders. If it does, Fox would then be allowed to negotiate with Comcast and take a closer look at its offer. This would be the time for Fox to learn more about Comcast\u2019s commitments when it comes to regulatory approval, for example.  \u201cLet the ping-pong tournament begin, as Comcast won\u2019t let Fox brush off its all-cash premium offer without a fight,\u201d Macquarie analyst Amy Yong said in a research note last week.  Once Fox engages in talks with Comcast, it will then have to determine if the offer is definitively a superior deal for Fox shareholders, compared with its agreement with Disney. This will be the first step that could lead to a bidding war as Disney will then have five business days to put a revised offer on the table, according to its merger agreement.  Disney could sweeten its all-stock bid with cash, given its strong balance sheet and the potential boost to earnings per share, according to the people familiar with the matter.  Technically, Fox could also rebuff Comcast\u2019s bid on Wednesday, but that is unlikely, said Morningstar analyst Allan Nichols.  \u201cBecause of the liabilities of the board I don\u2019t think they can outright say no to Comcast\u2019s offer. You at least need to do some kind of review process,\u201d he said.  TAX, ANTITRUST CONCERNS  In its review, Fox will need to decide whether Comcast\u2019s richer, all-cash offer is enough to offset the antitrust risk and potentially higher tax liabilities for some of its shareholders, analysts said.  A U.S. court\u2019s recent approval of AT&T Inc\u2019s merger with Time Warner Inc raised the likelihood that Comcast\u2019s similar proposed deal with Fox would get the green light from regulators, they said.  However, there are still concerns that some aspects of the proposed deal could complicate an antitrust review, they added.  Craig Moffett, an analyst at Moffett Nathanson, said that the Justice Department never addressed the question of whether internet providers such as Comcast could give an advantage to its own content at the expense of competitors.  For example, Comcast could give its internet subscribers easier or faster access to content from Hulu, which it would gain control over by buying Fox, than that of other media streaming services, the analysts said.  If an all-cash bid does eventually beat a stock offer, it could have a bigger tax hit on Rupert Murdoch, Fox\u2019s largest shareholder, who controls 17 percent of the company\u2019s voting shares along with his family.  Reuters previously reported before the details of Comcast\u2019s offer were made public that the financial impact on Murdoch would be big enough for him to prefer an all-stock transaction, which would be nontaxable for all Fox shareholders. That potentially puts Murdoch, who remains the most powerful voice inside the company, at odds with some Fox shareholders who would be open to abandoning the Disney deal if Comcast\u2019s cash offer was high enough.

Adults, kids and senior citizens wear masks while wandering among staff and security guards who carry contact-less thermometers and hand sanitizer.  As some U.S. states lift stay-at-home orders, investors and park fans are watching to see how Walt Disney Co -- which makes a third of its revenue from parks, experiences and products -- reimagines the \u201chappiest place on earth\u201d for a world altered by the coronavirus.  The high-touch, high-volume, kid-centered nature of the parks, and Disney\u2019s need to prevent damage to a brand synonymous with safety and families, will make reopening difficult, experts said.  Disney\u2019s ability to reopen its parks in Asia, the United States and France will also be a powerful signal about how the world can get back to a semblance of normal as it deals with COVID-19.  \u201cThis is the greatest challenge that the industry has ever faced,\u201d said Phil Hettema, founder of The Hettema Group, which designs theme park rides and other experiences.  Disney, which has not announced any plans to reopen the parks, declined to comment for this story.  Executive Chairman Bob Iger recently said checking guests\u2019 temperature could become routine at Disney park entrances. Among other plans under consideration, according to a source briefed on Disney\u2019s thinking: Rides like the Space Mountain roller coaster could stagger guests in each \u201crocket\u201d to enforce social distancing. Guests could be notified via app or another technology when they can go on a ride or in a restaurant to eliminate lines.  Staffers, known as cast members, and guests could be required to wear masks. But in true Disney fashion, employees\u2019 masks would be fun, not scary, the source said.  Disney on Thursday began online sales of face masks featuring Mickey Mouse, Baby Yoda and other characters and said up to $1 million in profits would go to charity.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Masks, now worn commonly across China, are ubiquitous in the shopping district outside Shanghai Disney, where workers disinfect a playground for 5- to 12-year-olds at noon and 3 p.m. daily. Temperature checks are mandated by local regulations, according to Shanghai Disney\u2019s website.  Business and political leaders in Florida, home to Walt Disney World, have floated ideas such as limiting capacity at all theme parks during an initial re-opening phase.  The question that health experts and financial analysts are asking is whether any of these measures will be enough to protect employees, guests or Disney\u2019s bottom line.  Social distancing could come at a steep price.  In April, UBS downgraded its rating on Disney and lowered its division profit estimates to $500 million in fiscal 2020 and just $200 million in 2021 compared to $6.8 billion in 2019.  Disney parks need to be running at roughly 50% of capacity to be profitable, according to the firm.  Investors will see a fuller impact of coronavirus when Disney releases its second-quarter results on May 5; Comcast said on Thursday that if its Universal Studios parks remain closed for the entire second quarter, the company would suffer an earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization loss of roughly $500 million.  Financial analysts have predicted reopen dates for Disney ranging from as early as June to Jan. 1. Guidelines will be set by governors in California and Florida, where Iger and Walt Disney World Resort President Josh D\u2019Amaro sit on state reopening task forces. The rest is up to Disney.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Although Disney and other large venues face an unprecedented challenge protecting guests from an easily spread airborne virus, experts and a former executive pointed to its experience handling crowds.  More than 157 million people visited Disney parks in 2018, according to the Themed Entertainment Association.  \u201cIf anybody can figure it out, Disney will,\u201d said Dave Schmitt, founder of MR-ProFun, a consultant to theme parks.  Safeguards have limits. Temperature checks will not catch everyone infected, and most vaccines are not 100% effective, said Dr. Megan Murray, a global health professor at Harvard Medical School.  Even so, a vaccine would provide some reassurance for park-goers, according to a Reuters\/Ipsos poll conducted from April 15-21. While a fifth of respondents said they would attend an amusement, theme or water park whenever they reopen, about 30% would go if a vaccine was available. The poll, which surveyed 4,429 American adults, noted that a vaccine might not be available for more than a year.  Loyal fans are counting on Disney to get this right. Chicago resident Kelly Alexis, 50, has been to Disney resorts 35 to 40 times and plans to go to Disney World with her family in October if the park is open.  \u201cIt\u2019s just the feeling that they do things so perfectly and they will take every precaution,\u201d Alexis said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to want to have an epidemic where everyone gets sick at Disney. They would never let that happen.\u201d","34":"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp CMCSA.O confirmed on Wednesday it was preparing a higher, all-cash offer for most of the media assets of Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA.O, setting up a bidding war with rival Walt Disney Co DIS.N, which already has agreed to a $52-billion deal with Fox.  The largest U.S. cable operator said it was in advanced stages of readying a bid that would be superior to Disney\u2019s all-stock offer.  \u201cWhile no final decision has been made, at this point the work to finance the all-cash offer and make the key regulatory filings is well advanced,\u201d Comcast said in a statement.  The news lifted Fox shares 1.6 percent to close at $38.77. Comcast shares closed down 1.9 percent at $31.88 and Disney shares fell 1.1 percent to $102.89.  By going public with its plans, Comcast is putting pressure on Fox and its shareholders to not rush into approving the Disney deal. Fox shareholders will vote on the Disney deal later this summer. A date has not yet been set.  Comcast may have a tough time winning over Fox\u2019s largest shareholder, Murdoch, however.

Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this month that Comcast was working on financing for a cash offer worth as much as $60 billion for the Fox assets, but Wednesday\u2019s statement was the first formal confirmation by the company.  Fox and Disney declined to comment. Fox\u2019s Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch said earlier this month that the company was committed to its agreement with Disney but added that Fox\u2019s board was aware of its fiduciary duties on behalf of all shareholders.  Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst with JBL Advisors, said that Comcast seems intent on winning a bidding war for Fox.  \u201cRivalry can frequently drive prices to un-economic levels,\u201d Logsdon said.  Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts will only proceed with a bid if a federal judge next month allows AT&T Inc's T.N planned $85-billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc TWX.N to proceed, sources have said.  Disney in December offered stock then worth $52.4 billion to buy Fox's film, television and international businesses to beef up its offering against streaming rivals Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.  Disney shares have fallen more than 3 percent since that deal, reducing the value of the offer to just over $50 billion.  Comcast, owner of NBC and Universal Pictures, has also separately made a 22 billion pound ($30 billion) offer to acquire the 61-percent stake in European pay-TV group Sky Plc SKYB.L that Fox does not already own. In doing so, it topped an earlier offer for the entirety of Sky by Fox.  A regulatory filing in April showed Comcast offered to acquire most of Fox\u2019s assets in an all-stock deal valued at $34.41 per share, or $64 billion last November - just before Disney\u2019s offer was agreed upon.  After a sale, Fox\u2019s remaining assets will include Fox News, Fox Business Network and sports cable networks.","35":"LONDON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Meghan, the wife of Britain\u2019s Prince Harry, has agreed to record a voiceover for Disney in return for the company making a donation to a charity that works to protect elephants, the London-based Times reported on Saturday.

Shares of the largest U.S. bank by assets rose 3.83% after the company beat quarterly profit estimates, easing fears that slowing economic growth could weigh on its results.  The S&P financial index rose 1.43%, providing the biggest boost to the main index, while the S&P banks index gained 1.67%.  The main U.S. indexes have been in a holding pattern ahead of the first-quarter earnings season, which many analysts say could witness the first quarterly drop in S&P 500 profit since 2016.  Shares of Well Fargo & Co, however, fell 2.18% after the lender cut its forecast for 2019 net interest income. PNC Financial Services Group Inc rose 2.18% after its first-quarter profit met estimates.  \u201cJPMorgan reporting better-than-expected results are obviously a boost to the market. It is early in earnings but at least it\u2019s starting off good,\u201d said Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Informa Financial Intelligence in Zephyr Cove, Nevada.  Another big gainer was Walt Disney Co, whose shares jumped as much as 12.3% to hit a record of $130.90 after the company priced its streaming service in a bid to challenge the digital dominance of Netflix Inc. Netflix fell 3.41%.  The communication services sector gained 0.84%.  At 11:01 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 193.49 points, or 0.74%, at 26,336.54, the S&P 500 was up 12.67 points, or 0.44%, at 2,900.99 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 18.64 points, or 0.23%, at 7,965.99.  Analysts project earnings growth at S&P 500 companies to decline 2.3 percent in the first quarter as the impact of tax cuts fade and worries about global growth come to the fore. Bank earnings are expected to grow 3%, according to Refinitiv data.  \u201cExpectations for this earnings cycle have been subdued, but after results from these big financials it shows that things have started off really well. So one has to wonder maybe the expectations were too low to begin with. But so far, so good,\u201d Nauman added.  However, investors are hoping that the earnings season will be better than feared, helping the U.S. indexes reach all-time highs. The S&P 500 is just 1.4% away from a record high hit in September.  The S&P 500 total return index hit a record high on Friday, underscoring the importance of reinvesting dividends.  Data from China showed exports rebounded in March but imports shrank for a fourth straight month and at a sharper pace. The data, which eased concerns about a slowdown in world\u2019s second largest economy, as well as a jump in oil prices offered support to global equities.  Grabbing the spotlight in the energy sector was Chevron Corp\u2019s $33 billion offer to buy smaller rival Anadarko Petroleum Corp. Shares of Anadarko jumped 32.44%, while Chevron fell 5.25%.  The S&P energy index was up about 0.29%.  Shares of Anadarko and its peers led gains on the S&P 500. Devon Energy Corp and EOG Resources Inc gained more than 5% each, while Marathon Oil Corp was up 3.09%.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.77-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.40-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.  The S&P index recorded 44 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 67 new highs and 24 new lows.

Bird will replace John Fallon, who cut thousands of jobs and sold off assets in response to a string of profit warnings during his more than seven years in charge of the world\u2019s biggest education group.  The new CEO will receive a salary of $1.25 million, the chance to double that if he hits targets, the opportunity to earn more again if he beats targets, and shares that vest over three years, currently worth around $9.3 million.

(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co Chief Executive Bob Iger told Reuters on Wednesday it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d for the media company to keep filming in Georgia if a new abortion law takes effect because many people will not want to work in the U.S. state.  Disney has filmed blockbuster movies in Georgia such as \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d and it would be a blow to the state\u2019s efforts to create production jobs if the entertainment giant stopped filming there.  Georgia\u2019s Republican governor signed into law on May 7 a ban on abortion after a doctor can detect a fetal heartbeat - about six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. The law is due to take effect on Jan. 1, if it survives court challenges.  Asked if Disney would keep filming in Georgia, Iger said it would be \u201cvery difficult to do so\u201d if the abortion law is implemented.  \u201cI rather doubt we will,\u201d Iger said in an interview ahead of the dedication for a new \u201cStar Wars\u201d section at Disneyland. \u201cI think many people who work for us will not want to work there, and we will have to heed their wishes in that regard. Right now we are watching it very carefully.\u201d  If the law takes effect, \u201cI don\u2019t see how it\u2019s practical for us to continue to shoot there,\u201d he added.  Georgia is one of eight states to pass anti-abortion legislation this year for the purpose of inducing the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark case that established a woman\u2019s right to terminate her pregnancy.  The state offers a tax credit that has lured many film and TV productions. The industry is responsible for more than 92,000 jobs in Georgia, according to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), and some 455 productions were shot in Georgia in 2018, according to the state.  Some actors and producers have already said they will no longer work in Georgia because of the abortion law, but many of the large production companies have remained publicly silent on the abortion law.  On Tuesday, Netflix Inc said the streaming service would \u201crethink\u201d its film and television production investment in Georgia if the law goes into effect.  In the meantime, Netflix will continue production there for now and work with groups that are fighting the law in U.S. courts.","46":"FILE PHOTO: A screen shows the logo and a ticker symbol for The Walt Disney Company on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., December 14, 2017.

It was is possible that instead of re-engaging in pursuit of all of Fox assets, Comcast could zero in on something in particular, such as European pay TV giant Sky, the Wall Street Journal report said, citing anonymous sources.  The Murdoch family, which controls Fox, preferred a deal with Disney because it would rather be paid in Disney than Comcast stock, and expects a potential deal with Disney to be cleared by U.S. antitrust regulators more easily, sources told Reuters in December.  Disney struck a deal with Fox to buy film, television and international businesses. The deal is set to bring to a close more than half a century of expansion by Murdoch, 86, who turned a single Australian newspaper he inherited from his father at the age of 21 into one of the world\u2019s most important global news and film conglomerates.

Disney, which has a three-tier structure that charges visitors more during peak periods to help spread out crowds, said peak one-day tickets for a single theme park at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, would see the biggest increase, rising to $135 from $124.  Value and regular one-day tickets are now $97 and $117, respectively, compared to $97 and $110 last year.  One-day prices to the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida rose 2 percent to 4 percent, with tickets there now ranging between $109 and $129.  The company also said it plans to make changes to its annual pass program at Disneyland as well make its multiple-day tickets to Walt Disney World date-specific in order to help manage crowds, particularly as it prepares to open a new Star Wars attraction at both parks next year.

Set to open in local theatres on Friday, Disney had high hopes for Mulan in China, but starving it of publicity in the country\u2019s strictly censored media would be another blow to the $200 million production.  Starring big-name Chinese actors - Jet Li, Gong Li, Donnie Yen and Liu Yifei - and based on a Chinese folk story, Mulan was tailored to appeal to audiences in China, the world\u2019s second-largest movie market.  But mixed reviews online and capacity limits in theatres due to coronavirus prevention measures were likely to weigh on its box office performance, even before major media outlets received a notice telling them to refrain from covering the movie.  Three sources told Reuters media outlets had received the notice, two of whom said it was sent by the Cyberspace Administration of China. A fourth source at a major Chinese newspaper said he received a text message with a similar order from a senior colleague.  No reason was given in the notice, but the sources said they believed it was because of the overseas backlash over the film\u2019s links to Xinjiang.  Neither the Cyberspace Administration or Disney immediately responded to requests for comment.  Partly shot in Xinjiang, Mulan\u2019s credits included thanks to the authorities there, which prompted calls overseas for a boycott of the movie. China\u2019s clampdown on ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang has been criticised by some governments, including the United States, and human rights groups.  On Wednesday, the Global Times, a tabloid run by the ruling Communist Party\u2019s People\u2019s Daily, criticised the backlash against the movie in an editorial in its English edition, describing it as \u201canother manifestation of the extreme ideologies regarding China among US public opinion.\u201d  Disney had worked to ensure Mulan tested well with Chinese audiences, and the company\u2019s chief financial officer told investors on Wednesday that it was \u201cvery pleased\u201d with the initial results of its release elsewhere.  The movie was released on Disney\u2019s streaming service in many markets, rather than in cinemas, due to the COVID-19 outbreak.  Mulan is likely to be shown on more than 40% of China\u2019s screens on Friday, according to data from Maoyan, a Tencent-backed ticketing platform. Chinese theatres are currently limiting capacity, typically at 50 percent.  The film had sold 9.78 million yuan ($1.43 million) worth of tickets as of Thursday afternoon, accounting for 55% of all ticket sales sold across China for Friday\u2019s shows.  One analyst, who declined to be named because he said the situation is sensitive, predicted the film would earn a dismal 150 million yuan at mainland box offices, given early audience reviews.  The film, which many have already seen online, has received a 4.7 score out of 10 on popular social media site Douban, where users leave reviews of films, books and music.

Slideshow ( 5 images )  The measures come in addition to restrictions announced on Sunday that will see all schools close for in-person learning for the rest of the year, also from Dec. 2.  Games centres, karaoke lounges and swimming pools will close from Wednesday and civil servants, excluding those that provide emergency services, will stay at home, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam told reporters.  The Ocean Park theme park and DisneyLand will also close, said secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan.  \u201cIt will be very critical in the coming two weeks,\u201d Lam said. \u201cI hope that Hong Kong people can remain tolerant.\u201d  Gyms and sports centres will remain open but only to a maximum of two people at a time, while massage and beauty salons will stay in operation, the government said.  Restaurant dine-in hours will be shortened to 10 p.m. from midnight, with no more than two people per table. A ban on gatherings will also be capped at two people, down from four.  Bars in Hong Kong are already shut, but some are trying to skirt the rules by placing plates and cutlery with customers under the pretence they are dining.  The global financial centre has so far managed to avoid the widespread outbreak of the disease seen in many major cities across the world, although the stop-start restrictions have caused frustration among some business owners and residents.  While there had been a ban on gatherings of more than four people, larger groups of residents have been widely seen together across the territory, especially on weekends and public holidays, although it\u2019s rare to see anyone without a face mask.  Lam said there were 76 new cases on Monday, bringing the total in the city of 7.4 million to more than 6,300 since the epidemic started, with 109 deaths. Forty of the latest tally were related to dance clubs. The overall figure was lower than Sunday\u2019s nearly four-month high of 115.  Lam said fines for breaches of the new rules could be doubled to at least HK$4,000 ($516).  The latest rise in cases has also led to the postponement for at least two weeks of a travel bubble between Hong Kong and Singapore - which was due to be launched on Nov. 22.  Having once had the highest COVID-19 rates in Southeast Asia, Singapore has all but eradicated the virus and has the world\u2019s lowest fatality rate with just 28 deaths.","60":"TOKYO, June 23 (Reuters) - Tokyo Disney Resort operator Oriental Land is preparing to reopen its parks on July 1 and will restrict visitors to 15,000 people per day as a coronavirus countermeasure, the Nikkei reported on Tuesday without citing sources.

Shares of Disney, which had risen 27% this year and hit an all-time high last week, dropped as much as 5% in after-hours trading to $135.  Excluding certain items, Disney earned $1.35 per share for the quarter that ended in June, below average analyst estimates of $1.75 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Disney, the owner of ESPN, a movie studio and theme parks, is investing heavily in digital media platforms to challenge the dominance of Netflix Inc NFLX.O.  Its biggest digital bet, a family-friendly subscription service called Disney+, is scheduled to debut in November. Shows aimed at adults will be concentrated on Hulu, which Disney now controls.  The direct-to-consumer and international unit reported an operating loss of $553 million from April to June, wider than the $441 million loss analysts were expecting, and up from a $168 million loss from a year earlier. Costs piled up from consolidation of Hulu and spending on Disney+ and the ESPN+ streaming service, Disney said.  Future digital investments will lead to a roughly $900 million operating loss in the direct-to-consumer unit in the quarter that ends in September, the company said, compared with expectations of a $593 million loss.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  For the just-ended quarter, executives said Fox\u2019s film studio performed worse than expected while the costs to broadcast cricket through Fox\u2019s Star India were higher than anticipated.  \u201cSome of the other misses seem to be related to the integration of Fox,\u201d said analyst Jim Nail at Forrester. \u201cI would speculate that they have decided to take all their lumps this quarter and put all this \u2018bad\u2019 news together, clearing the board for better results next quarter.\u201d  Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said the company was focused on integrating the Fox film and TV assets and using them with Disney\u2019s businesses to move quickly into streaming video.  \u201cNothing is more important to us than getting this right,\u201d Iger said. \u201cWe remain confident in our strategy and our ability to successfully execute it.\u201d  Iger also said it would bundle its streaming services, charging $12.99 a month for Disney+, ESPN+ and ad-supported Hulu, starting in November.  At the theme parks unit, overall operating income rose 4% to $1.7 billion but declined at Disney\u2019s U.S. parks. The company attributed the drop to expenses for a \u201cStar Wars\u201d-themed expansion at California\u2019s Disneyland and lower attendance.  Media networks, which includes ESPN, the Disney Channels and FX, reported a 7% increase in operating income to $2.1 billion.

The group, Protect Democracy Project Inc, filed suit in U.S. District Court in Washington seeking any records of communications about Fox\u2019s Rupert Murdoch or the Fox-Disney transaction.  The lawsuit also seeks \u201cany related antitrust enforcement efforts by the DOJ, to find out whether the president or his administration is improperly interfering with the independence of the DOJ out of favoritism for a political ally.\u201d  The White House, the Justice Department and Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Fox declined to comment.  U.S. President Donald Trump, who has attacked AT&T Inc\u2019s $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc deal, spoke to Murdoch in December and congratulated him on the deal, according to White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.

While Mickey Mouse joined familiar Disney characters welcoming the crowds, the Shanghai experience will not be as it was: Instead of parades and fireworks, there are mandatory masks, temperature screenings and social distancing for visitors and employees.  Among the crowd on Monday was Shanghai Disneyland passholder Kay Yu. \u201cI think (these measures) make tourists feel at ease,\u201d said the 29-year-old, who was wearing a Minnie Mouse hat and said he had woken up at 4 a.m. to make the trip to the park.  Disney\u2019s $5.5 billion China flagship is the first of its six resorts around the world to reopen after the pandemic that has now killed more than 280,000 people globally threw consumer service businesses around the world into turmoil. The reopening may provide a glimpse of how Disney can begin to recover from closures set to strip $1.4 billion from the company\u2019s profit.  But the limited scope of the reopening in Shanghai underlines the scale of that task: While it welcomed more than 10 million guests in its first year after opening in 2016, the park will now restrict visitor numbers to 20% of daily capacity, or about 16,000 people - far below a level initially requested by the Chinese government.  As well as scrapping parades and fireworks - replacing the latter with an evening light projection show - Disney has shut interactive children\u2019s play areas and indoor live theatre shows.  Still, the vast majority of its rides as well as most of its restaurants and shows will be open, said Andrew Bolstein, the park\u2019s senior vice-president of operations. More might reopen in time to come depending on the situation and government regulations, he added.  Slideshow ( 19 images )  Zhang Zhongyu, a 29-year-old passholder and visitor who works in importing, said the things he missed most about the park were the shows and the parade - two attractions that have been cancelled.  \u201cI\u2019m a little disappointed, but there\u2019s nothing we can do - thinking of the virus, you have to avoid guests gathering closely, it\u2019s understandable,\u201d he said.  \u2018COMING HOME\u2019  Visitors holding annual passes are being asked to reserve an entry time and day in advance, and tickets for the earliest days of Shanghai Disneyland\u2019s re-opening have been sold out.  Monday\u2019s guests, mostly parents with children or young couples, were greeted by waving park staff as they walked in, having been asked to show a green health code on their mobile phones before being allowed in. All wore masks.  Markers have also been added to areas where people might congregate, such as shops and entertainment areas, to tell visitors where and where not to stand, while audio announcements regularly remind guests to maintain social distance. Visitors on rides are also asked to sit well apart.  Slideshow ( 19 images )  \u201cIt\u2019s like a feeling of coming home, I feel extremely happy,\u201d said passholder Yu.  \u201cFor us fans it\u2019s very meaningful to be here on the first day of its reopening, and to be able to experience its reopening, it feels like a magical day.\u201d  Still, the reopening comes after a weekend of unwelcome reminders that a second wave of the virus could happen, including the first confirmed case for more than a month in Wuhan, the city at the epicentre of the outbreak late last year.  The number of new cases in China, where the epidemic first emerged late last year, has sharply dropped in recent weeks but sporadic outbreaks continue. Some 17 new COVID-19 cases were reported for the mainland on May 10, rising from a day earlier and marking the highest daily increase since April 28.  Concerns about the virus weren\u2019t far from the mind of Shanghai Disneyland visitor Chen Xue, 31, who works in marketing and said she would have not come to the park if it were not for the social distancing measures.  \u201cThe virus is still not over and it has made me so incredibly anxious,\u201d she said.","82":"FILE PHOTO: Walt Disney Co's Disneyland and California Adventure theme parks in Southern California are now closed due to the global outbreak of coronavirus in Anaheim, California, U.S., March 14, 2020.

Mayer led the successful launch of the Disney+ streaming service in November but in February was passed over as Disney\u2019s new chief executive.  Mayer\u2019s appointment will be effective June 1, when he will also become chief operating officer of ByteDance, the Chinese company said.  TikTok, which allows users to create short videos with special effects, has become wildly popular with U.S. teenagers doing viral challenges that pair dances with music clips from the app\u2019s library. TikTok has hinted at ambitions to build a music streaming business, announcing in January that it was partnering with U.K.-based music rights agency Merlin to expand its musical selections.  ByteDance\u2019s Chinese ownership, however, has sparked concerns in Washington about TikTok\u2019s handling of personal data. The company uses sophisticated artificial intelligence to make video recommendations based on users\u2019 behavior on the app.  In November, the U.S. government launched a national security review of ByteDance\u2019s $1 billion acquisition of social media app Musical.ly, which became TikTok. Two senators introduced a bill to ban federal employees from using TikTok on government-issued phones.  One of those senators, Republican Josh Hawley, said TikTok previously told him its executives could not testify before Congress because they were located in China.  \u201cBut this new executive lives in the USA,\u201d Hawley wrote on Twitter on Monday. \u201cI look forward to hearing from him. Under oath.\u201d  To appease concerns, ByteDance has stepped up efforts to separate TikTok from much of its Chinese businesses and has made several high-profile executive hires in recent months. It appointed former Microsoft intellectual property chief Erich Andersen as global general counsel in January, after hiring Vanessa Pappas, a veteran YouTube executive, to run its U.S. operations last year.  Speculation over Mayer\u2019s future began swirling in February after Disney named Robert Chapek as chief executive officer. Mayer, who has a \u201cloud and forceful\u201d style, according to a former Disney executive, was seen as a dealmaker who had only recently been put in charge of a large profit-and-loss division. His relative lack of operating experience was a main reason he did not get the top job, the former executive said.  A ByteDance spokesman said the company had \u201cno reservations\u201d about Mayer\u2019s operational experience. \u201cAny company in our sector would be delighted have him onboard.\u201d  Under Mayer\u2019s leadership, Disney+ collected more than 50 million subscribers in five months.  Disney named Rebecca Campbell, a 23-year company veteran, to replace Mayer as head of the direct-to-consumer and international division, which includes the streaming media units Disney is counting on to drive future growth.","91":"* Singapore shares slump nearly 2 pct * Philippine stocks climb as trading resumes after holiday * Expectations of Fed rate hike in December also weigh By Nikhil Subba Nov 5 (Reuters) - Most Southeast Asian stock markets fell on Monday, hit by worries that a U.S.-China trade deal may not be imminent, while Philippine shares climbed as trading resumed after a two-day holiday.

It provided audiences sheltered at home with early access to \u201cThe Last Dance,\u201d an ESPN documentary series about basketball great Michael Jordan that became an instant hit. National Football League draft coverage also drew record ratings for ESPN and Disney\u2019s ABC broadcast network.  Among other shifts, Disney moved Pixar movie \u201cOnward\u201d to video on demand early, and put \u201cFrozen 2\u201d and \u201cStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\u201d on the Disney+ streaming platform ahead of schedule.

She is one of 13 analysts who rate Disney shares a \u201cbuy.\u201d  \u201cThey have incredible brands, and it\u2019s extremely well managed,\u201d Ehrlich said. When the health crisis subsides and the economy bounces back, \u201cthere will be pent-up demand for sports and experiences, theme parks, movies and TV shows,\u201d she said.  Among other analysts, five rate Disney a \u201cstrong buy\u201d and 10 a \u201chold,\u201d according to data from Refinitiv.  A bright spot is the Disney+ streaming platform that debuted in November. Disney said on April 8 that the offering had attracted more than 50 million paid subscribers in five months. The service will expand to more countries in 2020.  But Disney is spending heavily to build its digital future. Analysts expect the streaming division, known as direct-to-consumer and international, to report a loss of $861 million.

Shares of Disney were flat following the results after bouncing between positive and negative territory.  The results showed Disney made a strong entrance into the streaming video wars dominated by Netflix Inc. The owner of sports powerhouse ESPN is trying to transform its business to capture audiences that are moving online.  Analysts at three brokerages had expected more than 20 million subscribers to Disney+, which is available in five countries including the United States. Disney+ will be available in India on March 29 through streaming service Hotstar.  Netflix, which began delivering online video 13 years ago, boasts 67.7 million paid subscribers in the United States and Canada.  Subscribers at Hulu, a streaming service Disney now controls, climbed to 30.7 million as of Monday, the company said.

He said the service did not experience significant cancellations after the end \u201cThe Mandalorian,\u201d a \u201cStar Wars\u201d series that became a cultural phenomenon thanks to a character commonly called Baby Yoda.  During an earnings call, Iger said that \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d will return in October and will go beyond season two, \u201cincluding the possibility of infusing it with more characters and taking those characters in their own direction in terms of series.\u201d  Selling Disney+ in a bundle with ESPN+ and Hulu helped lower cancellation rates, Iger added.  Earnings for the quarter grew with help from healthy business at Disney\u2019s theme parks and the strong performance of animated movie \u201cFrozen 2.\u201d  Excluding certain items, Disney earned $1.53 per share, above the average analyst estimate of $1.44, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue rose to $20.9 billion, up 36% from a year earlier.  The parks, experiences and products division posted operating income of $2.3 billion, up 9% from the prior year.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Disney was forced to close both Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland in late January during the busy Chinese New Year holiday to help stop the spread of coronavirus.  The closings could shave $135 million off operating income at Shanghai, and $40 million at Hong Kong, if they extend for two months, Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said.  The bulk of Disney\u2019s theme parks revenue comes from its U.S. parks. Iger told CNBC that advance U.S. bookings had not been affected.  The Hong Kong park could see an additional $105 million decline in operating income during the quarter, McCarthy said, as ongoing anti-government protests have depressed tourism.  Disney\u2019s direct-to-consumer and international segment, the division that is spending big to build the streaming business, reported an operating loss of $693 million, below analyst expectations.

The reopening of Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure Park that was earlier scheduled for July 17 will be delayed until Disneyland receives an approval from state officials, the company said.  In late January, the pandemic started battering businesses across Disney\u2019s global portfolio when the company shuttered Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland.  Last month, the company estimated that global lockdown measures aimed at tamping down the spread of the contagion slashed its profit by $1.4 billion, mostly from its shuttered theme parks.

Last week, Apple Inc said it is temporarily shutting some stores again in Florida, Arizona, South Carolina, and North Carolina.  Disney had also come under fire earlier as unions representing 17,000 workers at its Disneyland Resort in California expressed concerns to the state\u2019s governor about not being convinced that the theme park will be safe enough to reopen by the company\u2019s target date.

Harry\u2019s father Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, and his elder brother Prince William, will also attend the meeting, due to take place on Monday at the queen\u2019s Sandringham estate in Norfolk, eastern England, a Buckingham Palace source told Reuters.  Meghan, an American former TV actress, will try to join via telephone from Canada where she returned earlier in the week to rejoin the couple\u2019s baby son, Archie.  Harry and Meghan, officially known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, surprised the rest of the royal family on Wednesday by publicly announcing they wanted a \u201cnew working model\u201d that would allow them to spend more time in North America and to be financially independent.  They did not consult the 93-year-old monarch or other members of the family before making their announcement on a new website, sussexroyal.com, a move which hurt and disappointed the queen and other royals, according to a royal source.  The meeting on Monday will be the first time the senior royals have met in person to discuss the concerns raised by Harry and Meghan.  Officials had been holding talks behind the scenes since the bombshell statement to try to work out a new arrangement for the couple, and a royal source said those efforts progressed well.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The consultations, which also included the British and Canadian governments, paved the way for a face-to-face meeting between Harry and the queen.  The palace source said it remained the queen\u2019s aim to a find a resolution to the crisis in days rather than weeks but it would require \u201ccomplex and thoughtful discussions\u201d and any agreement would take time to be implemented.  The split between Harry and the other Windsors is the latest crisis the royal family has faced in a period described last month as \u201cbumpy\u201d by the queen in a televised annual address.  Such is the global interest in Harry and Meghan that their news has overshadowed a scandal surrounding the queen\u2019s second son Prince Andrew and his friendship with disgraced late U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein, who hanged himself in jail in August while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.  In an emotional TV interview last October, Harry admitted he and William had fallen out.  The Sunday Times newspaper said the elder prince had spoken of his sadness at the rift. The brothers were close for years following the death of their mother Princess Diana in a Paris car crash in 1997.

I want everyone to play on the team.\u201d  Earlier on Saturday, the Times newspaper reported that Meghan had agreed to do voiceover work for Disney in return for the company making a donation to a charity she supports that works to protect elephants.

Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong and internet users in Taiwan and Thailand are among those who promoted hashtags \u201c#BoycottMulan\u201d and \u201c#BanMulan\u201d on Twitter, following this month\u2019s launch of the film on Disney\u2019s streaming platform.  It will also be shown in cinemas in China - an increasingly important market for Hollywood studios - from Sept 11.  Disney\u2019s shares rose 1.7% to $134.20 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday as investors shrugged off the backlash on hopes that subscribers to the company\u2019s streaming video service in the United States and other markets paid $30 over the weekend to watch the film as part of a test release amid the coronavirus pandemic.  In a note on Tuesday, Deutsche Bank analysts upgraded shares of Disney from a hold to a buy and raised their price target from $128 to $163.  Criticism of the live-action remake of a 1998 animated version began last year when Mulan\u2019s star, mainland Chinese-born actress Liu Yifei, expressed support on social media for police in Hong Kong, which was roiled at the time by anti-government unrest.  Liu did not immediately respond to a request for comment via her account on Weibo, a popular Chinese microblogging site.  Calls for people to boycott the film gathered pace this week over its links to the western region of Xinjiang, where China\u2019s clampdown on ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims has been criticised by some governments, including the United States, and human rights groups.  Several state organisations in Xinjiang appeared in the film\u2019s credits, according to social media posts.

Asked about the reaction to the film\u2019s Xinjiang shooting, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian restated Beijing\u2019s denial of the existence of re-education camps in the region, calling facilities there vocational and educational institutions and accusing anti-China forces of smearing its Xinjiang policy.  Wong, the Hong Kong activist, accused Disney of \u201ckowtowing\u201d to China, citing Liu and another actor\u2019s support for police in the territory and the movie\u2019s credits mentioning state organisations in Xinjiang.  \u201cWe urge people around the world to boycott the new Mulan movie,\u201d he told Reuters on Tuesday.  Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  CHINESE PREMIERE  The movie, produced for $200 million, had been scheduled to reach theaters in March, but its release was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Last month, Disney said Mulan would skip most theaters and go directly to its Disney+ platform, where it is available for $30 for U.S. subscribers.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  While Disney has not released the number of users who have watched \u201cMulan\u201d since its Sept. 4 Disney+ release, downloads of the app between Friday and Sunday increased by 68% from the same period a week prior, according to app analytics firm Sensor Tower.  The film is set to premiere in Chinese cinemas from Friday, and the studio hopes it will do better than the animated version more than 20 years ago.  That release was delayed after Disney\u2019s relations with China soured over \u201cKundun,\u201d its 1997 movie based on the life of the exiled Dalai Lama, whom China has branded a dangerous separatist.  In February, director Niki Caro told the Hollywood Reporter that Disney had tested the film with Chinese audiences, removing a kissing scene between Mulan and her love interest after feedback from its Chinese executives.  Hollywood counts on big returns from China, the world\u2019s second-largest box office market, to help make its blockbusters profitable.  Disney\u2019s 2019 mega-hit \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d took in $629.1 million in China, roughly 23% of its $2.8 billion worldwide total.

Iger said he saw \u201can opportunity to increase investment in Hulu, notably on the programming side,\u201d and he believed there was room to raise prices.For the just-ended quarter, the media networks unit, Disney\u2019s largest, reported a 4 percent year-over-year rise in operating income of $1.5 billion as broadcaster ABC saw higher program sales and fees from channel distributors.  The ESPN cable network continued to shed subscribers, the company said, as viewing moves to digital platforms.  To counter that ongoing shift, Disney this year released a streaming service called ESPN+ with live college sports, documentaries and other programming that does not run on television. Disney+, by comparison, will include movies and TV shows aimed at family audiences, and Hulu will reach broader with edgier programming for adults.  Disney+ could lift the company's stock if the streaming service can challenge Netflix and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at global financial platform, Investing.com.  \u201cDisney\u2019s big beat on expectations is great news for the company which is getting ready to take on competitors in the video-streaming business who are taking away ad dollars and consumers,\u201d Anwar said.  In the just-ended quarter, the theme parks division reported operating income of $829 million, an 11 percent increase from a year earlier, as guest attendance and spending at Disney\u2019s U.S. locations rose during the busy summer months.

Walt Disney chief executive Robert Iger announced the spending plan after meeting President Emmanuel Macron in the French capital.  The development will include three new areas based on Marvel\u2019s superheroes such as Spider-Man and the Hulk, Disney\u2019s animated film Frozen and Star Wars, and will be rolled out in phases, starting in 2021. There will also be new attractions and live entertainment experiences.  \u201cThe expansion plan is one of the most ambitious development projects at Disneyland Paris since its opening in 1992 and underscores the company\u2019s commitment to the long-term success of the resort as Disney\u2019s brand beacon in Europe,\u201d Walt Disney said in a statement. (Reporting by Dominique Vidalon, editing by Richard Lough)","114":"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. cable giant Comcast Corp CMCSA.O has offered $31 billion for Sky Plc SKYB.L, threatening a plan hatched by Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOXA.O and Walt Disney Co DIS.N to seize control of Europe's biggest pay-TV group.  The world\u2019s biggest entertainment company and owner of NBC and Universal Pictures said on Tuesday it proposed to offer 12.50 pounds per share for Britain\u2019s Sky, more than the 10.75 pounds that Murdoch\u2019s Fox has agreed to pay for it.  Bob Iger\u2019s Disney has agreed to buy Sky from Fox, along with other assets, in a separate $52 billion follow-up deal.  Comcast\u2019s all-cash, unsolicited offer pits CEO Brian Roberts against Murdoch, the 86-year-old tycoon who helped to launch Sky and pioneered pay-TV in Britain. Iger is also a long-time rival after Comcast tried and failed to buy Disney in 2004.  \u201cSky and Comcast are a perfect fit: we are both leaders in creating and distributing content,\u201d Roberts said. Sky\u2019s shares jumped more than 20 percent, closing at 13.31 pounds, indicating that investors expect a bidding war. Shares of Comcast, Fox and Disney fell.  Comcast\u2019s appearance in the already complex Sky drama could prompt Fox to make a higher offer or Disney to make its own direct bid for Sky. Fox remains committed to its cash offer announced in December, it said in a statement.  Media owners have been forced into increasingly aggressive deals after online groups Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O prompted many customers to ditch subscriptions.  Comcast bid $60 billion last year to clinch a deal with Fox, before losing out to Disney.  Sky, which provides sports programming, films and broadband to 23 million homes across Britain, Ireland, Germany, Italy and Austria, urged its investors to take no action since the approach did not represent a firm offer.  Murdoch\u2019s Fox agreed to buy the 61 percent of Sky it did not already own in a cash deal in December 2016, but the takeover has been repeatedly held up by regulators over concerns the media tycoon wields too much influence in Britain.  The shares had been trading above the asking price since Sky this month agreed to pay less than expected for Premier League soccer rights, likely boosting its future earnings and prompting investors to demand a higher offer.  It also attracted the attention of U.S. hedge fund and activist investor Elliott Management Corp, which has built up a 2.5 percent stake in Sky in recent weeks.  Hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, a former son-in-law of Murdoch who holds 1 percent of Sky, said he expected a counter offer and speculated whether Disney could make a direct bid for Sky to avoid Fox\u2019s regulatory problems.  \u201cOnce you\u2019re in a bidding war, it\u2019s not about fair value, it\u2019s about what do you think it\u2019s worth,\u201d Odey added.  \u2018LET BATTLE COMMENCE\u2019  Formed in 1990, Sky has built its business by offering leading content and technology. It snapped up Murdoch\u2019s pay-TV groups across Europe in 2014 to offer a distribution platform that is now proving attractive to the big U.S. content owners.  Comcast said it had not yet engaged with Sky over the proposal and its finance director, Michael Cavanagh, declined to comment on whether it could lead to a renewed bid for Fox. Comcast will have to gain the support of Sky\u2019s independent directors if it does not make a hostile bid because its chairman is Murdoch\u2019s son James, who is also CEO of Fox.  Slideshow ( 11 images )  Comcast\u2019s Roberts, the son of Ralph who founded the company in 1963, called Sky\u2019s Deputy Chairman Martin Gilbert on Tuesday morning to notify him just before the offer statement was released, and called Sky CEO Jeremy Darroch shortly afterwards.  Sky\u2019s independent directors are expected to meet in the coming days to discuss the offer and the company said they were mindful of their duties to investors.  Comcast went public with the proposal to trigger the regulatory timetable because timing will be a key factor.  A Comcast spokesman said it would ask regulators in Brussels to look at the deal where it expects to avoid a lengthy investigation. Britain\u2019s media minister has said he will give his verdict on Fox\u2019s bid for Sky by June 14, giving Comcast a narrow window to get any takeover approval done.  Slideshow ( 11 images )  \u201cWe would like to own the whole of Sky and we will be looking to acquire over 50 percent of the Sky shares,\u201d Roberts said.  Disney\u2019s Iger declined to comment when asked about the Comcast offer during a trip to Paris.  MURDOCH TO LEAD THE CHARGE?  Murdoch had been edging towards a deal for Sky in recent weeks, eight years after he first tried to buy the company.  Britain\u2019s competition regulator said in January his planned takeover should be blocked unless a way was found to prevent the Australian-born power-broker from influencing Sky\u2019s news operation.  Critics, including many politicians, argue Murdoch wields too much influence through the Sun and Times newspapers, and in 2011 he closed the News of the World after its journalists admitted hacking phones to get scoops.  Seeking to prove it would not influence Sky News in the future, Fox last week promised to maintain and fund a fully independent Sky-branded news service for 10 years.  British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s ministers have appeared wary of approving Murdoch\u2019s bid, repeatedly asking the independent regulator to intervene, and Comcast could face a smoother ride.  A spokesman for May said the deal was a commercial matter.  Robey Warshaw, a small boutique firm which has worked on some of Britain's biggest deals, Evercore EVR.N and Bank of America Merrill Lynch BAC.N are advising Comcast.","115":"(Adds background)  LONDON, March 26 (Reuters) - A film narrated by Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, will be available to watch from April 3, Disney said on Thursday, marking her first job since she and her husband Prince Harry stepped back from royal duties.  The film, titled \u201cElephant,\u201d will be available on the Disney+ platform. It was described in a short trailer posted online as following the journey of a family of elephants across Africa.  Harry and Meghan stopped their royal duties at the end of the month as they carve out \u201ca progressive new role\u201d, mainly based in North America, which they aim to finance themselves.

She married Harry, sixth-in-line to the British throne, in May 2018 in a lavish ceremony at Windsor Castle.","116":"Disney character Mickey Mouse attends the 25th anniversary of Disneyland Paris at the park in Marne-la-Vallee, near Paris, France, April 12, 2017  LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Sky shareholders may be unduly worried about a truce. Shares in the pay-TV group are down 2 percent since suitor Comcast last week said it wouldn\u2019t challenge Walt Disney\u2019s bid for most of Twenty-First Century Fox. Yet the Mickey Mouse owner could still prove a nuisance to Comcast in the battle for Sky, to investors\u2019 gain.  Sky\u2019s falling share price suggests investors think that Comcast\u2019s defeat will also defuse the battle for the UK group. After losing out to Disney\u2019s $71 billion bid for Fox assets, including its 39 percent Sky stake, Comcast boss Brian Roberts said he\u2019ll instead focus on buying Sky, for which he is competing with Fox. For Roberts to get full control, he will need Fox to sell its stake. That might suit Disney, as it would help fund the larger deal.  But a truce may not be in Disney\u2019s interest. Boss Bob Iger called Sky the \u201ccrown jewel\u201d of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox empire. That\u2019s because he could use its technology and streaming service to channel Disney\u2019s TV shows and movies directly to consumers. Sky, which reaches 120 million people, is the only way Disney can gain scale in Europe.  Iger has already shown he is happy to pay up. When Fox raised its offer to 14 pounds per share, Disney agreed to reimburse the difference above 13 pounds in case the wider tie-up fails. Stretching to 15 pounds per share, enough to trump Comcast\u2019s latest offer, would cost an extra $1.4 billion \u2013 small in the context of the bigger Fox deal.  Iger and Murdoch have an advantage over Roberts. Disney\u2019s acquisition of Fox assets includes the 39 percent stake in Sky, so the cost of a raise would only apply to the 61 percent it doesn\u2019t own. That means any price increase does more damage to Comcast than Disney. And Iger has little reason to let Comcast win easily, since Roberts has plenty of firepower that\u2019s now concentrated only on Sky.  Investors are not betting on a big raise. Sky\u2019s share price is 15.08 pounds, just 2 percent above Comcast\u2019s latest offer. Second-guessing Iger is risky. He might just let Comcast buy out other Sky investors, and then hold out for a better price. Still, there\u2019s a good chance that Sky\u2019s takeover war gets even more heated.","117":"April 8 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co said on Wednesday Disney+ has garnered over 50 million paid users globally, with 8 million of them coming from India where the streaming service was launched last week.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The world\u2019s biggest video streaming platform by paid customers, Netflix told Reuters more than a million of its nearly 200 million subscribers around the world are in Southeast Asia, home to around 655 million people. But the market is ripe for rapid growth, analysts say, with the Disney+ Hotstar launch in Indonesia next month set to become a key battleground.  \u201cWhat we see in Southeast Asia is that it\u2019s a very mobile-centric market\u201d, Netflix director for product innovation Ajay Arora told Reuters in a recent interview. That\u2019s led the company to push cheaper mobile plans and adapt its product to fit lower-end smartphones, Arora said.  Southeast Asia is estimated to have generated $600 million in overall subscription music and video revenue in 2019, according to a study by Google, Temasek Holdings and Bain & Co - but that\u2019s set to explode to an annual $3 billion by 2025, the study said.  Starting with India in August 2019, Netflix has now launched mobile-only plans in Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia - all priced at below $5 a month. That\u2019s a departure for Netflix, which has held firm on pricing in Western markets.  Repeated coronavirus lockdowns across Southeast Asia have also increased the appetite for content streaming at home across the region.  A Netflix spokeswoman told Reuters that the firm \u201chas well over 1 million subscribers in multiple Southeast Asian countries\u201d, but declined to provide details.  Consultancy Media Partners Asia estimates that Southeast Asia video streaming service subscribers will reach 14.7 million in all by the end of 2020.  Netflix executive Arora said his firm is also working to expand its payment options in countries with low credit and debit card penetration. In markets like the Philippines, subscribers can pay for Netflix through their mobile telephone plans, or by purchasing prepaid Netflix cards at convenience stores.  The company faces competition in the region not just from Disney+, a distant, but ambitious, global no. 2 in the industry. Other regional rivals include Hong Kong video service Viu, popular for its Korean dramas, as well as Chinese tech giant Tencent\u2019s WeTV, which in June bought the assets of Malaysian streaming platform Iflix.  Disney+ is currently in the middle of a hiring spree across the region and is expected to launch broadly in the coming months jointly with its Indian streaming platform Hotstar. Disney\u2019s family and superhero movies have proven consistent hits in Southeast Asia.  In Indonesia, the world\u2019s fourth most populous country with 270 million people, Disney+ said last week it would start operating in September in partnership with state-owned telco Telkomsel with a catalogue that will include more than 300 local movies.  Bracing for the challenge, Netflix Southeast Asia content lead Myleeta Aga told Reuters that the firm, which announced two new original Indonesian productions earlier last Thursday, places high importance on the region and will continue to ramp up local content offerings. She said Netflix expects to start filming projects in Indonesia and Thailand soon.","119":"(Reuters) - A large minority of Walt Disney Co DIS.N shareholders who cast votes at the company's annual meeting on Wednesday opposed the company's executive pay plan, Disney said.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Disney said 46% of votes were cast against the plan and 53% in favor of the plan, with 1% abstaining. The vote is advisory and non-binding.  About 82% of total shares outstanding were represented by the vote, the company said.  Disney has previously faced criticism over former Chief Executive Bob Iger\u2019s pay, which was $65.6 million in the company\u2019s 2018 fiscal year, up 80% from the previous year. At its 2017 annual meeting, Disney suffered a rare rebuke when a majority of shareholders opposed its executive pay in a non-binding vote.  Disney announced Iger stepped down on Feb. 25 but remains at the company as executive chairman. He will focus on content creation until he retires at the end of 2021.  At the meeting in Raleigh, North Carolina, shareholders did not vote on new CEO Bob Chapek\u2019s compensation - only on a pay plan for other executives in fiscal year 2019, which ended Sept. 28. That plan set Iger\u2019s 2019 compensation at $47.5 million, according to a Jan. 17, 2020 filing.  But Julian Hamud, senior director at proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis, said via email that \u201cBoth transitions are quite expensive, and it was not lost on us that Mr. Chapek\u2019s employment agreement explicitly states that he reports to the executive chairman.\u201d  Glass Lewis advised shareholders to oppose the 2019 executive pay plan in a non-binding vote, as did other proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Egan-Jones.  In Disney\u2019s current proxy statement, the company acknowledged the pushback on executive pay, stating that during the fiscal year 2019, members of management and the board spoke with 11 of the company\u2019s top 20 shareholders and contacted approximately 74% of its largest 50 investors, \u201cseeking input on compensation and governance matters.\u201d Based on that feedback, Iger agreed to reduce his compensation on three different occasions.  In his new role as chairman, Iger\u2019s employment agreement will continue unchanged. So until he retires at the end of 2021, Disney will be paying for both Iger and Chapek, whose compensation is set at a minimum of $25 million annually.  The Florida State Board of Administration, which manages pension assets for Florida state and local employees and had 2.3 million shares of Disney as of the end of 2019, voted against the compensation plan this year. \u201cIt seems to be maximized for payout without sufficient ties to the performance levels,\u201d said Jacob Williams, corporate governance manager with the organization.  In a March 5 filing, Disney defended the plan, writing that \u201cIger\u2019s compensation in fiscal 2019 reflected the considerable value he generated for the company and its shareholders, with the completion of the acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox and implementation of the company\u2019s transformative direct-to-consumer strategy, culminating in the successful launch of Disney+.  More than 90% of Iger\u2019s compensation is performance-based, and under his leadership since 2005, Disney has delivered total shareholder return of 559%, compared with just 223% for the S&P 500 as of fiscal year-end 2019.\u201d  Disney said that 92% of shareholders who cast their vote at the annual meeting had voted to elect all nine members of the board of directors.

Twitter announced the deals in New York at the Digital Content Newfronts, where companies promote upcoming programming to advertisers.","125":"(Reuters) - AT&T Inc\u2019s advertising unit Xandr said Wednesday it is partnering with Walt Disney Co, AMC Networks and sister company WarnerMedia to make it easier for advertisers to buy TV commercials across the networks.  Since forming Xandr in 2018, phone carrier AT&T has sought to allow advertisers to target certain audiences using AT&T data, which it gathers from offering phone, internet and TV services. The moves are part of an effort by the TV industry as a whole to catch up to digital advertising behemoths like Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Facebook, where the ability to target ads has long been more advanced.  Advertisers will be able to use a new version of a self-serve tool called Xandr Invest to define an audience they want to reach, such as people in the market to buy a car, and then place a single order through the tool that will find the commercial slots across its partners that will reach those viewers.  WarnerMedia, which is also owned by AT&T, includes cable channels like TNT and CNN, while Disney owns broadcaster ABC and sports network ESPN. AMC Networks includes the BBC America and IFC channels.  A benefit to partnering on Xandr Invest is the tool allows AMC to control the pricing of its ads and whom it works with, said Evan Adlman, senior vice president of advanced advertising and digital partnerships at AMC.  While Xandr Invest serves as the technology to buy ads and target audiences across the partners, the networks themselves will retain control in selling the ad space, said Mike Welch, executive vice president of product and business development at Xandr.  The new TV ad buying capabilities are meant to round out Xandr\u2019s appeal to advertisers, which historically had a focus on internet display ads, Welch added.  The new version of Xandr Invest launches just ahead of the upfront season in May, a critical annual advertising sales period where brands preview the upcoming TV season and buy commercials in advance.","126":"FILE PHOTO: Crowds walk along Main Street toward Cinderella Castle and Tomorrowland at Disney's Magic Kingdom on the final day before closing in an effort to combat the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in an aerial view in Orlando, Florida, U.S. March 15, 2020.

Splash Mountain, \u201cwill soon be completely reimagined\u201d with a story that features Princess Tiana preparing to attend a Mardi Gras performance, Disney said in a blog post.  \u201cTiana is a modern, courageous and empowered woman, who pursues her dreams and never loses sight of what\u2019s really important. It\u2019s a great story with a strong lead character, set against the backdrop of New Orleans and the Louisiana bayou,\u201d the company said.  Hollywood companies including Disney are revisiting works from the past in light of renewed calls for racial justice following the death of African American George Floyd in U.S. police custody.  The petition on Change.org said Splash Mountain was a \u201cbeloved classic\u201d at California\u2019s Disneyland, Walt Disney World in Florida and Tokyo Disneyland. But \u201cits history and storyline are steeped in extremely problematic and stereotypical racist tropes from the 1946 film Song of the South.\u201d","127":"SHANGHAI\/HONGKONG (Reuters) - As the novel coronavirus swept the world this year, Chinese hedge fund manager Yuan Yuwei made lucrative short-selling bets against stocks such as New York-listed Starbucks Corp SBUX.O, Yum China Holdings Inc YUMC.N and Walt Disney Co DIS.N.  At home, he barely bothered.  \u201cShort-selling is too inefficient in China. Either there are no available stocks to borrow, or it takes too long,\u201d said Yuan, who runs a global macro fund for Olympus Hedge Fund Investments.  Short sellers sell borrowed shares in the hope of buying them back when prices fall and pocketing the difference. Those such as Carson Block of Muddy Waters and Dan David of Wolfpack Research have made their name shorting Chinese stocks but, like Yuan, their bets have been against stocks in New York or Hong Kong, not Shanghai or Shenzhen.  This could be about to change. Last Friday, regulators relaxed short-selling rules for Shenzhen\u2019s $1 trillion (805 billion pounds) startup board, ChiNext, for domestic market participants. They are also considering letting foreigners borrow or lend mainland stocks to short.  Such reform could increase competitiveness and bring China\u2019s markets a step closer to more robust capital-raising centres such as New York and Tokyo.  Shares loaned for shorting in Shanghai and Shenzhen as of June 16 totalled $3.96 billion versus a stock market capitalisation of $8.9 trillion - a ratio of 0.044%, official data showed.  While markets do not calculate short data in exactly the same way, figures from IHS Markit show short interest in the United States of $780 billion, or 2.4% of market cap, and 1.5% for Tokyo.  Due to reform, however, Broker TF Securities estimates short selling in China is likely to grow 10-fold this year and double next year.  Others point to myriad hurdles - both operational and cultural.  \u201cIn the short term, many obstacles are insurmountable,\u201d said Wang Li, chief executive of hedge fund Full Harvest and former BlackRock money manager. \u201cLittle has changed after so many years, so I\u2019m a bit disillusioned.\u201d  REAL REFORM  Friday\u2019s changes mark a major shift since 2015, when regulators blamed \u201cmalicious\u201d short sellers for illegally \u201cmanipulating\u201d the futures market and triggering a crash.  Keen to attract international money, regulators said they are more receptive to shorting as a hedging tool used by long-term investors and as a means of profiting by betting against stocks deemed over-valued.  Regulators also hope it could act as a stabilising force if short sellers\u2019 bearish views help limit speculative bubbles.  Their ChiNext changes, likely effective from August, are part of reforms to the board\u2019s listing system.  Under these reforms, a wider group of domestic participants, including strategic investors, mutual fund managers, pension funds and insurers, will be allowed to lend stock.  Investors will also be able to short stock as soon as it debuts, compared with the main board\u2019s three-month lag.  While borrowers and lenders must still conduct transactions through China Securities Finance (CSF), both will be given greater scope to negotiate deal terms.  The next development participants are watching for is allowing foreigners to short - and lend - mainland shares.  \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that we can see more progress this year,\u201d said Lyndon Chao, head of equities and post trade at ASIFMA, which represents global asset managers and brokers in Asia, and regularly discusses market issues with mainland officials.  Foreigners seeking to hedge mainland exposure - which elsewhere would typically involve stock shorting - can currently only short index futures.  FRICTION  While reform is welcomed, participants said implementation may not be straightforward. One problem is finding shares to borrow.  \u201cMany Chinese institutions trade frequently for quick profit making them unlikely lenders,\u201d said Full Harvest\u2019s Wang.  Another issue is the cost of a centralised system, designed to ensure government oversight.  \u201cWhen you have CSF as a middleman, you add friction. They also charge you another two percentage points,\u201d said Fang Ming, vice general manager of hedge fund house MingShi Investment.  Fang and others said allowing participants to set their own terms will help, but not solve, issues created by having an intermediary.  The cost of borrowing mainland-listed stock is more than 8% annually of its value, versus 0.9% to 1.2% in Hong Kong, according to brokerage data and people familiar with the markets.  ULTIMATE TEST  The reforms come as support for short sellers publicly calling out potential problem companies has grown following a series of accounting scandals, such as that involving Luckin Coffee Inc LK.O, the U.S.-listed Chinese coffee chain that in April said executives falsified last year's sales.  Luckin\u2019s sales growth had been questioned two months previously in an anonymous report publicised by Muddy Waters.  Olympus\u2019 Yuan said a more open short-selling mechanism can help root out problem companies.  \u201cYou need short sellers to shoot them down and kick them out. Otherwise, they harm investors.\u201d  Chinese regulators have vowed \u201czero tolerance\u201d toward listed company fraud. The ultimate test for their newfound acceptance of shorting will be whether they let short sellers fire those shots, rather than punishing them as in 2015.  \u201cI could write articles criticising some listed companies, but I need to be very cautious, and the wording has to be gentle,\u201d Xin Chen, professor at the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance, told venture capitalists in a recent video seminar.  Wolfpack\u2019s David put it more simply: \u201cWithout some form of freedom of speech, short selling cannot exist.\u201d","128":"March 30 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Inc Executive Chairman Bob Iger will forgo his salary and newly named Chief Executive Officer Bob Chapek will take a 50% pay cut amid the coronavirus crisis, CNBC reported on Monday, citing an internal email.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The entertainment company detailed 10 new TV shows based on favorite characters from the sci-fi saga, including smuggler Lando Calrissian and droids C-3PO and R2-D2.  The announcement by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy came during a presentation for investors and follows the success of the \u201cStar Wars\u201d hit spinoff series \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d on Disney+ since November 2019.  Kennedy said the \u201cThe Mandalorian,\u201d featuring fan favorite Baby Yoda, had opened \u201can entirely new era for \u2018Star Wars\u2019\u201d and the chance to explore some 25,000 years of history in the galaxy far far away.  The Jenkins feature film, called \u201cRogue Squadron,\u201d will premiere in movie theaters at Christmas 2023. Kennedy said New Zealand director Taika Waititi was still writing the screenplay for another as yet untitled film in the franchise that Disney announced in May.  The announcements came a year after Disney decided to pause the development of \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies, one of the industry\u2019s most lucrative franchises, to focus on TV shows following the relatively disappointing box office takings for \u201cSolo\u201d in 2018.  On Thursday, Kennedy said two \u201cMandalorian\u201d spinoff series, called \u201cThe Rangers of the New Republic\u201d and \u201cAhsoka\u201d would come to Disney+ at Christmas next year.  Actor and singer Donald Glover will reprise his role as the dashing smuggler for TV series \u201cLando,\u201d while Hayden Christensen will return as Darth Vader in \u201cKenobi,\u201d based on Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi, for what Kennedy called the \u201crematch of the century.\u201d Production on \u201cKenobi\u201d is due to start in March.  Disney also announced a new spy series called \u201cAndor,\u201d featuring \u201cRogue One\u201d rebel alliance intelligence officer Cassian Andor that started filming in London two weeks ago.  \u201cThis is a new era for \u2018Star Wars\u2019 and Lucasfilm with expanded opportunities for continued innovation, high quality story-telling and cinematic experiences like never before,\u201d Kennedy said.

FILE PHOTO: The entrance to Walt Disney studios is seen in Burbank, California, U.S. August 6, 2018.

Growth at Disney parks in the United States boosted results above analyst expectations. From January to March, Disney reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.61, ahead of analyst estimates of $1.58, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Heavy investment accounted for a 13 percent drop from a year ago by that measure.  Revenue rose 3 percent to $14.92 billion. Analysts had been expecting a small decline.  Disney is trying to transform from a cable TV leader to a streaming media powerhouse that, like Netflix Inc, sells subscriptions directly to consumers. Costs to build digital services will weigh on profits for several years, the company has said, but the stock has risen 15% since the Disney+ announcement in April.  Its biggest streaming bet, the family-oriented Disney+, is set to launch in November. The company told analysts in April that it expects Disney+ to achieve profitability in fiscal 2024.  The just-ended quarter reflected the purchase of film and TV assets from 21st Century Fox, which brought Disney more content for its streaming future.  For the quarter, the direct-to-consumer and international unit recorded a loss of $393 million from streaming costs.  Disney also recorded a $353 million impairment charge from its ownership stake in media startup Vice.  In the theme park unit, net income hit $1.5 billion as more visitors showed up at Walt Disney World in Florida and at Hong Kong Disneyland, and occupied hotel nights increased.  \u201cIncreased ticket prices haven\u2019t put visitors off, and hotels continue to be a major driver of additional spending,\u201d said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get caught up in the hype surrounding new films ... but it\u2019s the less glamorous Media Networks and Parks that pay the lion\u2019s share of the bills.\u201d  Overall net income jumped 85 percent, to $5.4 billion, thanks to Disney\u2019s acquisition of a controlling stake in Hulu through the Fox acquisition.  Media networks, a division that includes ESPN and ABC, reported $2.2 billion in operating income for the quarter.  The movie studio reported profit of $534 million, lifted by \u201cCaptain Marvel,\u201d which was a global hit but did not reach the level of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi\u201d a year earlier.","131":"Nov 13 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co on Wednesday said its new streaming service, Disney+, has reached 10 million sign-ups since launching on Nov. 12.

Is he up to the task?  Investors were not convinced and sent Disney shares down 3.7% by the end of the day, but sell-side analysts largely endorsed the succession plan.  Former colleagues said Chapek is well-cast in his new role, at least until former CEO Bob Iger\u2019s contract ends on Dec. 31, 2021. Until then, Iger will be executive chairman and direct the company\u2019s \u201ccreative endeavors.\u201d  The company declined to comment.  Over his 27 years at Disney, Chapek ran the Theme Parks and Consumer Products divisions, and was head of distribution at Studio Entertainment.  People who have worked with Chapek, 60, describe a numbers-driven executive with a strong operational background and focus on delivering quarterly results.  Chapek does not seek publicity, these people said, which would allow Iger to maintain a public role until he leaves Disney. The dynamic between the two will be more like a COO\/CEO relationship than CEO and chairman, according to former colleagues.  \u201cChapek is a decent option for complementing the things that Iger doesn\u2019t want to do,\u201d said a former colleague. \u201cDisney keeps him doing the stuff he does want to do and lets Chapek worry about the trains running on time.\u201d  Over the next 22 months, Chapek can rely on Iger\u2019s creative instincts to navigate big decisions in the content world, such as whether the company\u2019s new streaming service, Disney+, needs more original programming, while Chapek focuses on crises like managing the coronavirus fallout, which could include a material impact on Disney\u2019s parks, cruises and film business.  Less certain is Chapek's ability to take bold steps in new directions, such as Iger's $71 billion gamble that by buying 21st Century Fox, Disney could build a subscription video streaming service to compete against Netflix NFLX.O.  That bet led to Disney+, which is viewed as an early success with close to 30 million sign-ups. Maintaining that momentum will be harder as Disney faces new rivals such as AT&T Inc's T.N HBO Max, which is why the media and Wall Street largely expected Kevin Mayer, chairman of Direct to Consumer and International who oversees Disney+, to succeed Iger.  But Mayer, who has been at the company since 1993, had a relatively short time in an operating role compared to Chapek.  The big question for Disney, said one former colleague, is what happens when Iger leaves the company. \u201cThat\u2019s when the rubber hits the road.\u201d","135":"(Reuters) - Netflix Inc NFLX.O added slightly more paying subscribers than Wall Street expected in the third quarter, a relief to investors who had worried the company might fall short just as Disney and Apple prepare to ramp up the streaming video wars.  The results for July through September represented a rebound from the previous quarter when Netflix lost U.S. streaming customers for the first time in eight years and missed targets for overseas subscribers. Shares of Netflix rose 9.2% in after-hours trading on Wednesday to $312.69.  That performance, combined with concerns about new competitors, had weighed on Netflix shares, which had fallen 21% from the last earnings report through regular trading on Wednesday.  For the third quarter, Netflix was boosted by new seasons of shows such as \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201c13 Reasons Why.\u201d The company added 6.77 million paid customers around the globe, topping the nearly 6.7 million average expectation of analysts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Netflix said it was on track to achieve full-year operating margins of 13% and was targeting another 300 basis point expansion in 2020.  Its total subscriber count topped 158 million.  Still, the company faces challenges.  \u201cNetflix results were good enough that they assuaged concerns about price sensitivity and penetration levels in the domestic markets,\u201d said Fitch director Patrice Cucinello. \u201cA caveat is that competition hasn\u2019t hit yet.\u201d  The company projected it would pick up 7.6 million customers in the last three months of 2019. Analysts had expected a forecast of 9.4 million. The company will release a new installment of \u201cThe Crown\u201d and Martin Scorsese film \u201cThe Irishman\u201d during that time.  But it will face new competition starting in November from Disney+, a streaming service from Walt Disney Co DIS.N that will be stocked with movies and TV shows from Disney's popular Marvel, \"Star Wars,\" animation and other properties.  Apple Inc AAPL.O also will debut a much smaller streaming video service with original programming in November. AT&T Inc's T.N HBO Max, and a new offering from Comcast Corp CMCSA.O, are expected to enter the market next year.  Netflix argued that the new services would increase interest in the streaming video market broadly.  \u201cIn our view, the likely outcome from the launch of these new services will be to accelerate the shift from linear TV to on demand consumption of entertainment,\u201d the company wrote in a letter to investors.

The most popular Netflix plan in the United States costs $13, nearly double the $7-per-month cost for Disney+. Apple TV+ will debut at $5 per month.

That topped Wall Street\u2019s concensus target of $1.04.  Total revenue rose to $5.25 billion from about $4 billion. Analysts on average had expected $5.52 billion.  The debt that Netflix has amassed has sparked concern among some investors. The company said in the earnings report that it expected free cash flow to improve in 2020 and annually beyond that. In the meantime, Netflix will continue to tap the high-yield market as needed, it said.  In the next earnings report, Netflix will begin disclosing revenue and membership by regions - Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East\/Africa, Latin America and the United States, the company said.","136":"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co said on Tuesday it had moved up the launch of its video streaming service, Disney+, by a week to March 24 in the United Kingdom and in regions across Western Europe.

Murdoch agreed in June to sell Fox's entertainment assets to Walt Disney DIS.N for $71.3 billion and is nearing completion of the deal after receiving approval from the European Commission this week, subject to the sale by Disney of its interests in some news and documentary channels.

Disney submitted its proposal on Friday, according to a filing on the EU competition enforcer\u2019s website which however did not provide details.  The Commission extended its deadline for reviewing the deal to Nov. 6 from Oct. 19. It is now expected to seek feedback from customers and rivals before deciding whether to accept the concessions or demand more.  Disney secured approval from the U.S. Justice Department for the deal in June on condition after agreeing to sell Fox\u2019s 22 regional sports networks.  The deal would expand Disney\u2019s unrivalled portfolio of some of the world\u2019s most popular characters, uniting Mickey Mouse, Luke Skywalker and Marvel superheroes with Fox\u2019s X-Men, \u201cAvatar\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d franchises.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Deals rarely look as good on paper as they do in a chief executive\u2019s head. Comcast\u2019s $31 billion offer for UK satellite broadcaster Sky just about passes financial muster. Investors expecting a higher bid from Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Twenty-First Century Fox, with backing from Walt Disney boss Bob Iger, are betting on the triumph of sentiment over spreadsheet.  The cable giant run by Brian Roberts on Wednesday firmed up its offer of 12.50 pounds per Sky share, beating Murdoch\u2019s December 2016 bid by 16 percent. The move endangers the mogul\u2019s plan to sell Fox \u2013 including Sky \u2013 to Disney for $52.4 billion in stock. It also dashes any hopes that Iger and Murdoch could persuade Roberts to back away by offering him an alternative asset, like U.S. streaming service Hulu. Assuming British regulators clear both bids, it\u2019s a straightforward battle on price.  Comcast has the stronger hand. On Wednesday the $155 billion company said it had identified $300 million of annual pre-tax cost savings and a further $200 million of gains from combining Sky\u2019s TV shows and movies with Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal library. Generously add those to consensus estimates for Sky\u2019s operating profit in 2020, tax the lot at 18 percent, and the return on invested capital is almost 7 percent. That\u2019s just about in line with cable groups\u2019 cost of capital, according to New York University estimates.  It\u2019s hard to see how Murdoch and Iger could justify going higher. The House of Mouse has less overlap with Sky\u2019s core business as a distributor of video entertainment. Second, Comcast has greater firepower: its leverage is low for a cable group and its EBITDA this year will be greater than Disney and Fox combined, according to Eikon estimates. Besides, Comcast\u2019s dual-class stock means Roberts does not have to fret about shareholders blocking his plans.  Iger might conclude that Sky is crucial to his European expansion. Murdoch, meanwhile, will be reluctant to part with the company he spent decades building, and might want to hang on to Fox\u2019s 39 percent stake in case the wider Disney tie-up collapses. Nevertheless, investors who pushed Sky shares up 4 percent to 13.57 pounds on Wednesday are wagering on Disney and Fox disregarding financial sense.","149":"(Repeats to additional clients)  LOS ANGELES, May 26 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co will present its proposal for a phased reopening of its Orlando, Florida, theme parks to a local task force on Wednesday, the company said in a statement.

COVID-19 wiped out $3.5 billion in operating profit in the parks division.  \u201cThe majority of businesses worldwide have experienced unprecedented disruption as a result of the pandemic,\u201d Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek told analysts. \u201cMost of our businesses were shut down, and this had a huge impact.\u201d  Investors overlooked total revenue that fell short of expectations by nearly $600 million and focused on divisions including parks and its media networks with revenue declines that were not as bad as expected.  The Disney+ streaming service, which had 60.5 million paying customers as of Monday, was a bright spot in the quarter, Chapek said. Disney had reported 54.5 million subscribers as of May 4.  \u201cWhat we plan to do is invest even more in our content in order to keep that machine cranked and going,\u201d he said.  Combined with Hulu and ESPN+, Disney has attracted more than 100 million streaming customers worldwide since launching its big streaming effort nine months ago. Netflix Inc NFLX.O, which got a head start in the market when it began streaming 13 years ago, boasts 193 million.  The coronavirus outbreak forced Disney to delay the theatrical debut of movies including the live-action epic \u201cMulan\u201d about a Chinese warrior.  In a surprise move, Disney said it will release \u201cMulan\u201d on Disney+ on Sept. 4 for people to watch at home at a cost of $30, and in theaters in markets where Disney+ is not available.  Chapek said the shift was a one-time event and did not represent a shift in strategy.  The decision followed a deal in July between Comcast Corp's CMCSA.O Universal Pictures and cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc AMC.N to allow the studio to release films directly to consumers after just three weeks in theaters, down from the average three months.  Disney also said it would launch a new international streaming service under the Star brand.  \u201cInvestors are looking beyond the tough quarter to continued reopening of parks, while Disney+ is expected to see further growth,\u201d said Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar.  Theme park closures from April to June led to an operating loss of $1.96 billion in the parks and consumer products business. Even as four of its six theme park resorts around the world have opened, social distancing rules have limited attendance.  Demand at profit center Walt Disney World was lower than expected because of the resurgence of coronavirus infections in Florida, Disney Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said.  The media network segment, which includes ESPN and Disney channels, reported a 48% jump in operating income to $3.15 billion.  The direct-to-consumer and international unit, which houses the Disney+ streaming service, reported an operating loss of $706 million, below the $1.06 billion that analysts expected.  Operating income at the movie studio fell 16% to $668 million as many movie theaters remained closed.  Overall revenue fell 42% to $11.78 billion. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $12.37 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.  Net loss from continuing operations was $4.72 billion, or $2.61 per share, in the third quarter ended June 27, compared with a net profit of $1.43 billion, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier.","157":"LONDON (Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Elliott believes Walt Disney\u2019s DIS.N deal to buy assets from Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA.O has valued Sky SKYB.L at more than $34 billion, higher than any of the current offers for the British broadcaster, Britain\u2019s takeover regulator disclosed on Wednesday.  FILE PHOTO: The Sky logo is seen on outside of an entrance to offices and studios in west London, Britain June 29, 2017. REUTERS\/Toby Melville  Sky is at center of a bidding battle between Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox, which already owns 39 percent of the pay-television company, and U.S. cable giant Comcast CMCSA.O.  Disney has also agreed to a separate deal to buy TV and film assets from Fox, including its Sky shareholding, for about $71 billion. Disney was forced to raise the price it is paying for the Fox businesses in June to $38 a share after Comcast also tried to gate-crash that deal.  Comcast currently has the upper-hand in the fight for Sky after it offered 14.75 pounds a share for the broadcaster last month, trumping a sweetened 14 pounds a share bid that Fox made earlier in July.  But Elliott, which owns a 4.3 percent stake in Sky, and hedge funds Davidson Kempner and Farallon Capital have argued that Sky is worth at least 15.01 pounds a share in the wake of Disney\u2019s improved offer for the Fox assets, British regulator the Takeover Panel said on Wednesday.  That would value Sky as a whole at about 26.4 billion pounds ($34.3 billion), according to Reuters calculations.  Elliott and the two other funds did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  At issue is the price Disney might be forced to offer to take full control of Sky. This is set by the Panel and essentially puts a floor under Sky\u2019s shares, which closed at 15.44 pounds on Wednesday in London.  The Panel ruled in April that Disney would have to buy Sky if its deal for the Fox assets completes before either Fox or Comcast have managed to take control of the British broadcaster.  REGULATOR CHALLENGED  In the wake of Disney\u2019s improved offer for the Fox businesses in June, the Panel decided in July that any compulsory offer for Sky should be priced at 14 pounds a share. That ruling was then reviewed and upheld by the Takeover Appeal Board, an independent body, earlier this month after \u201cseveral interested parties\u201d lodged appeals against the decision.  The Panel and the Takeover Appeal Board identified the challengers on Wednesday, disclosing for the first time that Elliott, Davidson Kempner and Farallon had unsuccessfully argued for a mandatory Disney offer of no lower than 15.01 pounds a share.  Sky\u2019s independent directors had contended that the level of any mandatory Disney offer be set at 14.59 pounds a share, the Panel and the Appeal Board said.  Meanwhile, Fox had believed the compulsory Disney offer should have been fixed at 12.50 pounds a share but had accepted the regulator\u2019s original ruling of 14 pounds, according to the Panel and the Appeal Board.  They added that Disney, which had also not challenged the Panel\u2019s decision, had put a 12.50 pound a share price tag on the 39 percent Sky stake when it revised its offer for the Fox assets.  The disclosure of the different parties\u2019 valuations is significant because the battle for Sky is not over.  Both Fox and Comcast have until Sept. 22 to lift their offers for the pay-TV group if they decide to do so. If Sky\u2019s future is not resolved by then, the Panel has the power to intervene and run a formal auction to bring the bidding war to an end.","158":"Jan 21 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Company said on Tuesday it had moved up the launch of its video streaming service, Disney+, to March 24 in the United Kingdom and regions across Western Europe by a week, ahead of its earlier launch schedule of March 31.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Comcast, the owner of NBC, MSNBC and Universal Pictures, said on Tuesday it proposed to offer 12.50 pounds per share for Britain\u2019s Sky, more than the 10.75 pounds that Fox has agreed to pay for it.  Murdoch\u2019s Fox agreed to buy the 61 percent stake of Sky it did not already own in a cash deal in December 2016, but the takeover has been held up by regulators over concerns the media tycoon wields too much influence in Britain.  In December, Disney agreed to buy a number of Fox assets, including Fox\u2019s stake in Sky, in a separate $52-billion deal.  The next likely step is Comcast makes a firm offer, which would require the company to have its funding in place. Fox then could return with a higher offer.  Here are some of the scenarios on what may lie in store next for Sky:  FOX RAISES ITS BID  The most likely scenario, according to many analysts, is that Fox, with Disney\u2019s blessing, raises its bid, potentially prompting a bidding war with Comcast. Fox has to at least match Comcast\u2019s bid, but analysts estimate a final winning bid for Sky could go as high as 14 to 15 pounds per share. Sky\u2019s shares jumped Tuesday 20 percent, closing at 13.31 pounds, above Comcast\u2019s offer.  Under the terms of Fox\u2019s deal with Disney, Disney cannot bid for Sky on it own, so any bid would come from Fox. However, Disney CEO Bob Iger has spoken about the importance of Sky to Disney\u2019s plan to launch a global online streaming service. So it is likely that Disney would back Fox in bidding higher.  COMCAST WINS MAJORITY STAKE IN SKY  Fox could choose not to challenge Comcast, which has said its offer is contingent on acquiring more than 50 percent of Sky. Comcast would prefer to own the whole of Sky, so Fox could use its 39 percent stake in the company as a bargaining chip.  Once the its deal with Fox closes, Disney will own a majority stake in online streaming service Hulu in which Comcast is also a shareholder. Some investors have speculated that Disney could swap its controlling stake in Hulu as part of a deal for Comcast\u2019s stake in Sky.  Comcast is currently bound as a passive investor of Hulu, meaning it cannot buy more shares in the company, under its consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice when it bought NBCUniversal. However, that consent decree expires in September.  GOING ALL IN  There is an outside chance that Comcast could engage with Fox about buying the assets Disney is buying. Comcast had bid $60 billion before losing out to Disney, and sources have told Reuters that Comcast has been discussing bidding for the Fox assets again.  But such a deal would face significant regulatory hurdles in the U.S., which previously prompted Fox to snub Comcast\u2019s bid. There is no reason to believe that Fox\u2019s assessment of the regulatory risk will change.","168":"LONDON, March 26 (Reuters) - A film narrated by Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, will be available to watch from April 3, Disney said on Thursday, marking her first job since she and her husband Harry stepped back front line royal duties.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  It faces an uphill battle when it launches its Apple TV+ streaming service on Nov. 1 for $5 a month against rivals with deeper libraries and years of experience making hit shows.  To quickly build a subscriber base, Apple is offering a year of free service for customers who purchase most Apple devices. Several Wall Street analysts said on Monday that the company could sell as many as 200 million of its latest iPhones to existing users upgrading their old phones.  Apple TV+ - which at launch will include eight original shows, including \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d featuring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon and \u201cSee,\u201d a sci-fi drama featuring Jason Momoa - will be available in over 100 markets at launch.  The big question is whether those customers will stick around after the free trial ends.  Ahead of the announcement, analysts and investors viewed Apple, which is late to the streaming war, as facing a tough fight competing with Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Walt Disney Co's DIS.N Disney+. Apple is also trying to win out over HBO Max with its hit shows like \"Game of Thrones,\" \"Friends\" and \"The Sopranos.\"  Apple's offerings are dwarfed by the extensive catalog of industry leader Netflix Inc NFLX.O, which has a reported $10 billion budget for content and 151 million paid subscribers. tmsnrt.rs\/2N6OB2j  Walt Disney Co's DIS.N Disney+ - launching Nov. 12 - has helped lift the stock almost 20% in recent months. Disney, which already controls the fast-growing streaming service Hulu, boasts a deep library of Marvel's superhero hits, the Star Wars universe, \"Toy Story\" creator Pixar animation and the National Geographic channel.  Disney+ has a budget of over $1 billion for original content - a figure that will grow to around $2 billion by 2024. It is priced higher than Apple TV+, at $7 monthly or $70 annually. A bundle that includes ESPN+ and Hulu will cost $13 per month.  Media executives and analysts believe that most households are willing to pay for more than one streaming service. Many believe existing Netflix subscribers are unlikely to cancel their subscription to pay for other services. IAC IAC.O Chairman Barry Diller told CNBC in July that Disney has the best chance of catching up to Netflix \u201cbecause of its very, very popular content.\u201d  Apple will not directly compete with Amazon Inc's AMZN.O Prime Video because that service is bundled with other perks of Prime membership - most significantly, free one- or two-day delivery on most Amazon orders.  Next spring, Apple will face another significant rival in television: HBO. The forthcoming HBO Max, from AT&T T.N's WarnerMedia, likely priced at $16 to $17 per month, has a library of HBO, Warner Bros and other content, and is investing in original content as well.  Apple, which is spending $2 billion on original content this year, is sitting on $210.6 billion in cash. \u201cApple has the firepower to outspend a company like Disney by a wide degree,\u201d said media analyst Rich Greenfield. \u201cIf Apple makes great content, people will subscribe.\u201d  For now, Apple TV+\u2019s greatest advantage is its reach and its scale. With 1.4 billion devices worldwide, free service on most new device sales and a November launch in over 100 markets, it has the potential to do what no other service has done: be everywhere on Day One.","177":"BEIJING (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co\u2019s Shanghai Disney Resort will be closed until further notice to help China stop the spread of a flu-like virus, costing the theme park operator revenue during the country\u2019s biggest holiday season.

Last year Shanghai Disney had to stop selling tickets to visitors as the park got overcrowded.  \u201cIn response to the prevention and control of the disease outbreak and in order to ensure the health and safety of our guests and Cast, Shanghai Disney Resort is temporarily closing Shanghai Disneyland, Disneytown ... starting Jan. 25,\u201d the company said on its website.  \u201cWe will continue to carefully monitor the situation and ... announce the reopening date upon confirmation.\u201d  Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, and neighboring Huanggang, a city of about 7 million people, were in virtual lockdown, with restrictions in place elsewhere. A new coronavirus which broke out in Wuhan, central China, late last year has killed 25 people and infected more than 800.  Many businesses including retailers, airlines, travel agencies and hotel operators are on high alert, as health authorities fear the infection rate could accelerate over the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions of Chinese travel at home and abroad.  The outbreak has already prompted seven Chinese films that were set to premiere during the holiday to postpone screenings, forgoing what is usually the best week of the year at the Chinese box office.  Disney said it would refund tickets for admission to Shanghai Disneyland, on China\u2019s east coast, more than 800 km from Wuhan, or other services at the park as well as hotel bookings.  The estimated financial impact on the U.S. company\u2019s first theme park in mainland China, which opened in mid-2016 in its largest overseas investment at $5.5 billion, was not immediately clear.  The company was not immediately available to comment.  Shanghai Disney carried out a resort-wide makeover this month for a four-week event through Feb. 9 to celebrate the Year of the Rat with its characters including Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse and target China\u2019s middle class and booming domestic tourism.  Walt Disney Co owns a 43% stake in Shanghai Disney Resort which has Shanghai Disneyland theme park and two hotels with a total of 1,220 rooms.  The impact on businesses is set to increase as China discourages locals from gathering in crowded places. It has already stepped up measures to contain the virus, with public transport suspensions in 10 cities, the shutting of temples and closing the Forbidden City, Beijing\u2019s most famous tourist attraction.  Japan\u2019s Fast Retailing Co Ltd said on Friday it has temporarily closed 17 Uniqlo stores in Wuhan. China is a key growth market for the company which faces a saturated market and weak consumer spending in Japan.","178":"FILE PHOTO: Walt Disney Co's Disneyland and California Adventure theme parks in Southern California are now closed due to the global outbreak of coronavirus in Anaheim, California, U.S., March 14, 2020.

In a letter to Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday, the unions said they had been in discussions with Disney since mid-March when Disneyland was closed to help curb the coronavirus pandemic. The resort in Anaheim, in southern California, houses the Disneyland theme park and the California Adventure Park, both of which the company aims to reopen July 17.  \u201cUnfortunately, despite intensive talks with the company, we are not yet convinced it is safe to reopen the parks,\u201d the letter from the Coalition of Resort Labor Unions said.

The California Department of Public Health said theme parks would be able to welcome guests when the state reaches Stage 3 of its phased reopening plan. It is currently in Stage 2.  The agency said it would release guidelines on how to minimize coronavirus spread at theme parks, but said there was no timetable yet for when the guidance would be issued.Disney plans to reopen Florida\u2019s Walt Disney World on July 11 with extensive measures ranging from requiring masks and temperature checks to suspending activities such as parades that create crowds.  The Disneyland unions said the company had accommodated some concerns. But there were \u201cnumerous questions Disney has not answered, including any serious discussion of \u2018testing\u2019 - which has been the cornerstone of plans for other areas of the entertainment industry reopening,\u201d the unions said.  \u201cTherefore, at this point we do not know if the resort can be operated safely,\u201d the letter said.","179":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co DIS.N is banning advertising from Netflix Inc NFLX.O across its TV networks, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co DIS.N said on Monday it was furloughing additional workers from its Disneyland theme park in Southern California, because it still does not know when the state will allow it to reopen because of the coronavirus pandemic.  The number of furloughs, which include executive, salaried and hourly workers, was not known. It comes on top of the 28,000 employees who were laid off in September, mostly across Disney\u2019s U.S. theme parks, in California and Florida.  The furloughs was announced in a memo to staff from Disneyland Resort President Ken Potrock that was seen by Reuters. Disneyland, located in Anaheim, has been closed since mid-March.  California health authorities in October dashed hopes of the reopening of large theme parks anytime soon, saying that cannot happen until a county\u2019s COVID-19 risk level falls to the lowest of the state\u2019s four tiers regarding coronavirus spread and infections.  \u201cThe recently released state guidelines put us in limbo regarding a reopening timeline in the foreseeable future,\u201d Potrock\u2019s memo said.  As a result, Disney was \u201cin the untenable situation of having to institute additional furloughs for our executive, salaried and hourly cast,\u201d he said.  The furloughed employees will be able to maintain health insurance, and Potrock said he hoped to get them back to work once Disneyland eventually reopens.  Disney\u2019s theme parks in Florida and those outside the U.S. reopened earlier this year without seeing new major coronavirus outbreaks but with strict social distancing, testing and mask use.  Disneyland Paris was forced to close again late last month when France imposed a new lockdown to fight a second wave of coronavirus cases. The company\u2019s theme parks in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo remain open.","181":"Dec 3 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co said on Monday Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger has agreed to certain adjustments to his compensation package, which ties his paycheck to the company\u2019s performance, as it nears the completion of its Twenty-First Century Fox acquisition.  Under the new agreement here, Iger will earn no shares if the company's relative total shareholder return is less than or equal to 25 percentile of the total shareholder return of companies in the S&P 500 index.  \u201cIn line with the Disney Board\u2019s pay-for-performance philosophy, the amendments to Mr. Iger\u2019s contract establish more rigorous performance requirements for his equity award than those reflected in the original contract,\u201d a spokesperson of Walt Disney said. Under the previous compensation package, Iger was being paid up to $48.5 million in annual salary and bonuses following the Fox deal closure for each of the four years from 2018-2021.  The amended deal could help Disney assuage investor concerns over pay to Iger, who stood to earn up to $423 million over four years and faced concerns his performance targets were too low.  At last spring\u2019s shareholder meeting the company suffered a rare rebuke when a majority opposed its executive pay in a non-binding vote, a very rare result for a U.S. company.

(Reuters) - Workers at California's Disneyland Resort protested from their cars on Saturday, arguing that the Walt Disney Co DIS.N has not agreed to adequate protections for employees when the destination reopens to the public amid a pandemic.  Slideshow ( 12 images )  The company had planned to welcome guests back to Disneyland and neighboring California Adventure starting July 17 but delayed the restart date indefinitely.  Disney said this week that it would set a new opening date after the state issues guidelines on how theme parks can return to business safely amid the global coronavirus outbreak.  On Saturday, about 200 cars formed a caravan outside the resort in the protest staged by the Coalition of Resort Labor Unions, a group of 11 unions that represent 17,000 Disneyland workers.  The unions have called on the company to commit to providing onsite testing for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.  \u201cWhen Disney does reopen, we want it to be as safe as possible for cast members, for the guests, and for the families that cast members have to go back to,\u201d said Maria Hernandez, a union member who attended the rally.  Disney said in a Saturday statement that it has reached agreements on coronavirus protections with 20 union affiliates that include additional sick pay, face coverings for guests and cast members, and reduced park capacity.  In a letter to unions earlier this week, a Disney representative said existing COVID-19 testing was not recommended by U.S. health authorities for routine screening.  Instead, health officials recommend focusing on physical distancing, face coverings, hand washing and sanitization, the letter said.  Disney began shutting its theme parks in January as the coronavirus spread. It has reopened parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong to a limited number of guests.

The new cash-or-stock deal may be attractive to Fox\u2019s largest shareholder, Rupert Murdoch, who owns 17 percent voting shares along with his family. The Murdochs face a large capital gains tax bill under Comcast\u2019s all-cash offer. Disney\u2019s previous offer was all stock.  Fox\u2019s board of directors said Disney\u2019s latest offer was \u201csuperior\u201d to the proposal made by Comcast and would create \u201cone of the greatest, most innovative companies in the world.\u201d  Disney and Comcast want to bulk up their own entertainment businesses with Fox\u2019s well-known TV shows and movie franchises, like the \u201cX-Men\u201d superheroes and \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d to better compete with fast-growing digital rivals Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc.  Fox\u2019s international media companies Star India and European pay TV company Sky TV Plc appeal to Disney and Comcast for overseas growth.  \u201cThese bids are a validation of Fox assets, which can be a big help to someone looking to bring their content business to a global scale,\u201d said Drew Weitz, director of equity research at Omaha, Nebraska-based Weitz Asset Management.  The $800 million Weitz Value Fund owned 550,000 Comcast Class A shares and 450,000 Twenty-First Century Fox Class A shares at the end of March.  Disney\u2019s revised offer of $38 a share, which would be split 50-50 in cash and stock, is $10 a share higher than Disney\u2019s first bid in December 2017. Comcast\u2019s last bid was for $35 a share in cash.  Disney will also take on about $13.8 billion of Fox\u2019s net debt, implying a total transaction value of about $85.1 billion.  The latest move by Disney raises the hurdle for Comcast, which has to decide whether it is feasible to counter with a higher bid.  A Comcast representative declined to comment, but analysts and investors widely expect a counterbid from the largest U.S. cable company and owner of NBC Universal.  \u201cComcast has to come in with a higher bid,\u201d said Mario Gabelli, chairman and chief executive officer of Gamco Investors which owns 10.1 million Fox shares. \u201cThey are out of the game right now!\u201d  FOX SHARES JUMP 8 PERCENT  Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger played down any antitrust concerns in a deal, and said he has been working with regulators around the world for the past six months.  \u201cWe believe that we have a much better opportunity both in terms of approval and the timing of that approval than Comcast does in this case,\u201d Iger said.  Quoting Bloomberg News, CNBC reported that Disney was nearing U.S. Justice Department approval on the deal. Disney declined to comment immediately on the report.  Comcast may face tougher regulatory scrutiny if the deal involves any transfer of television licenses, which would trigger an Federal Communications Commission review, said Ketan Jhaveri, a former Justice Department attorney who served on its telecommunications task force for internet policy.

Disney added 1.2 percent to $107.43.  Sky Plc shares gained 3.1 pct as investors hoped Fox would increase its offer since the company could afford to pay more due to the bidding war. The European pay-TV group, 39 pct owned by Fox, is also being pursued by Comcast.  Major sports and news assets including Fox News, Fox Business Network and Fox Sports are not part of the businesses being sold and would be spun off into a separate company.  Following the deal, Fox shareholders would own about 19 percent of the combined company, Disney Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said on a conference call.  Disney no longer expects to complete the $20 billion share repurchase announced in December, McCarthy said.  Fox said it will postpone a special shareholders meeting in order to provide stockholders with an opportunity to evaluate Disney\u2019s amended offer.","184":"FILE PHOTO: Cast members Ron Yuan, Yifei Liu, Jason Scott Lee and Yoson An pose with director Niki Caro, at the European premiere for the film \"Mulan\" in London, Britain March 12, 2020.

In August, Disney-owned Marvel Studios and Sony\u2019s Sony Pictures were at an impasse over Spider-Man\u2019s future. Sony owns the rights to the Marvel character under a long-standing arrangement, while Disney controls others such as Iron Man, the Hulk, Captain Marvel and Black Panther.  The news about the breakup had disappointed fans, who took to Twitter to start a campaign with hashtags \u201c#SaveSpiderMan\u201d and \u201c#SaveSpidey\u201d.  Under the new deal, Marvel Studios and its president, Kevin Feige, will produce a third film starring Holland that will be released on July 16, 2021, a statement from the companies said.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics centre in Boves, France, May 13, 2019. REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol\/File Photo  Entertainment companies from Walt Disney Co to Dr. Seuss are increasingly turning to Amazon.com Inc\u2019s t-shirt printing service to help it get there. The trend is up-ending the traditional licensing model where brands worked with apparel wholesalers to produce garments and get them into stores.  The \u2018Merch by Amazon\u2019 on-demand printing service, in its third full year of operation, works by printing t-shirts once an order comes in, meaning content creators like video game makers and pay TV channels do not have to commit to a large merchandise inventory upfront.  This allows companies to offer t-shirts featuring niche characters that would not warrant a wide distribution.  \u201cYou can list overnight on Amazon all the merchandise that\u2019s for sale and then as you book sales you just make it and ship it,\u201d said intellectual property lawyer Gaston Kroub. \u201cIt completely cuts out that whole traditional supply chain.\u201d  The expanding service is another way in which Amazon is becoming a major player in the clothing industry. The company had a group of patents granted in recent years outlining a process to integrate fabric printing, cutting, sewing and dispatch to a customer in one computer-controlled process.  Bringing apparel manufacture back to the United States and Europe would eliminate the long production times and commitment to big orders inherent for Western apparel brands sourcing from countries like China, Vietnam and Indonesia.  When fabric cutting is delayed to the last possible moment and garments are produced on-demand, it can also prevent the pile-up of unsold inventory, allowing brands to sell more stock at full price.  Amazon told Reuters the \u2018Merch by Amazon\u2019 format allowed it to offer designs across 21 colors and 15 sizes without brands and content creators having to manage inventory.  It said it was interested in all brand types from major entertainment brands to musicians, consumer products and social media influencers with a minimum of 100,000 followers.  Following an upheaval of consumer habits, which has led to the shuttering of thousands of small apparel stores, Amazon has overtaken Walmart Inc as the most-shopped clothing retailer in the United States and outpaced Marks and Spencer Group PLC in Britain, according to surveys.  Amazon has a try-before-you-buy service as well as many of its own private label clothing brands.  Royalty revenue from sales of licensed merchandise and services globally amounted to $14.5 billion last year, up 2.6% from 2017, according to professional licensing association LIMA, with more than half of that coming from the U.S. and Canada.  Entertainment and character licensing was the biggest industry category, while apparel, toys and fashion was the biggest product category, a LIMA survey found.  Dr. Seuss Enterprises has increased sales through \u2018Merch by Amazon\u2019 by 40 percent since opening its store on the site around 18 months ago, selling t-shirts and hoodies emblazoned with characters like The Grinch and The Cat the Hat, president Susan Brandt told Reuters.  Dr. Seuss helps Amazon with design, but Amazon sources the clothing and handles the sales and distribution, a Dr. Seuss Enterprises spokeswoman said. Dr. Seuss also sells licensed products through stores like Target Corp and Walmart, she said.  Disney, which started printing t-shirts on-demand through Amazon in December 2016, has increased orders and expanded offerings from all its franchises since then, including Disney, Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel, a company spokeswoman said.  Disney also uses traditional licensing models to manufacture and sell products, the spokeswoman said.  Pay TV channel Cartoon Network, which started working with \u2018Merch by Amazon\u2019 in 2016, has added designs and increased profits via the service since then, a company spokeswoman said.  The brand prints with other vendors, but the on-demand service allows it to give frequent design updates and offer secondary characters that may not be available in traditional stores, she said.  TIDAL WAVE  \u201cThe profit-sharing on-demand model existed before Amazon started their effort, but the size that they are, they have created a tidal wave,\u201d said Gabi Seligsohn, former CEO and current board member of Kornit Digital Ltd, the Israeli company that provides textile printers for \u2018Merch by Amazon\u2019.  The business is growing. Environmental authorities in Philadelphia have approved an expansion at Amazon\u2019s Pennsylvania printing facility, allowing nearly 50% more printers, the Philadelphia Department of Environment told Reuters.  Amazon also runs a second printing facility in Dallas, which was also recently granted preliminary permission to install more printers, a spokeswoman for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality said.  Beyond the United States, Amazon has launched a \u2018Merch by Amazon\u2019 printing facility in Poland in mid-2018 that serves the British and German markets.  Amazon said it had not made any announcements regarding expansion.  Showing further interest in on-demand apparel manufacture, Amazon has been actively seeking patents in the space. Intellectual property lawyers say this shows where companies think the technology is going.  \u201cThere is no doubt that patenting activity is indicative of some kind of market trend,\u201d said John Lanza, Boston-based intellectual property lawyer at Foley & Lardner LLP. \u201cOn-demand apparel manufacture is very hot.\u201d  In 2017, Amazon Technologies was granted a U.S. patent for on-demand apparel manufacturing whereby a textile printer, textile cutter and computing device are linked up to cut out garment patterns and align them for sewing in response to electronic orders.  Amazon Technologies has been granted other patents linked to on-demand apparel manufacture since then, including continuous feed fabric cutting using lasers and a robotic system that uses fluorescent ink as a guide for cutting fabric.  Amazon, a prolific patent generator and one of the United States\u2019 top patent holders, declined to say whether it had put any of the patents into production. Amazon said it filed a number of forward-looking patent applications to explore new technologies and said they did not necessarily reflect current developments to products and services.  \u201cThe trend for things becoming on-demand is only going to grow,\u201d said Lanza.","188":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co is planning to reopen its Orlando-based Walt Disney World theme park on July 11, ending the longest shutdown of the company\u2019s highly profitable U.S. theme park division in its history.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of the Walt Disney Company is displayed above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the closing bell as the market takes a significant dip in New York, U.S., February 25, 2020. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  Yet investors remain wary that a reopening that includes attendance limits and strict social distancing rules will boost the company\u2019s shares, especially as record numbers of coronavirus cases limit the appeal of traveling to Florida. Instead, they point to the company\u2019s already-high valuation as a result of the outsized success of its Disney Plus streaming platform as limiting any benefit from the resumption of its U.S. park operations.  \u201cDisney has become the ultimate hold. You don\u2019t want to add to it here because it\u2019s unclear how long it will be until park revenue comes back to a normalized level, but you don\u2019t want to sell it\u201d because it remains more attractive than other media companies, said David Mazza, a managing direction at Direxion.  Disney did not respond to a request for comment.  Shares of the company are down 8.3% over the last month, compared with a 2.3% gain in the S&P 500 over the same time, and have fallen 19.1% since the beginning of January. Despite those declines, Disney trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 43.8, just below its 52-week high of 47.8. Its P\/E fell to a 52-week low of 14 on March 23 after beginning the year near 22.  Much of the gains in valuation have come from renewed investor attention to Disney Plus, which has attracted more than 50 million subscribers since launching in November. That growth, however, will likely not make up for the hit from the decline in the parks division.  \u201cThe economic recession plus the need for social distancing, new health precautions, the lack of travel and crowd aversion are likely to make this business less profitable until there is a widely available vaccine,\u201d analysts at UBS noted. They project that earnings before interest and taxes in the parks division will fall by approximately $500 million in this fiscal year and $200 million the next, compared with a $6.8 billion gain in fiscal 2019.  Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Funds, said his firm has been reducing its position in Disney because the shares look over-valued at a time when its parks division will be limited and its ESPN and ABC segments are suffering from severe cutbacks in professional sports.  \u201cA lot of the benefit you\u2019d get from the return to full speed of parks and the return to full speed to professional sports is going to get ruined by a P\/E contraction\u201d once investor euphoria over the launch of its streaming business wears off, Smead said. \u201cThe next 10 years are spectacularly in their favor in terms of demographics, but the expansion of the earnings ratio at the same time that COVID is crushing a significant part of their business doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d  Chris Marangi, a portfolio manager of Gabelli Funds, said investors are likely waiting for a larger margin of safety before taking bigger positions in the company, given its high valuation. Its parks division will likely not return to more normalized levels of revenue until at least 2022, he said, giving the company a short-term hit to earnings but building up longer-term demand once a vaccine relieves Disney of instituting capacity caps.  Disney has reopened its Shanghai and Hong Kong Disneyland parks, and on June 24 announced it was delaying a reopening of the original Disneyland in Anaheim, California indefinitely. The company\u2019s Tokyo parks opened July 1.  \u201cAs we look out, Disney is the best-positioned media company for the next decade given their franchises and the success of Disney Plus in particular, but the near-term is going to be challenged,\u201d Marangi said.","189":"(Reuters) - Hasbro Inc missed estimates for quarterly profit on Friday as the toy maker struggled with the collapse of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us and falling European demand, in a year without a major Disney princess or a Star Wars film to bolster sales.  Hasbro\u2019s results were in contrast to those of rival Mattel Inc, which on Thursday reported a surprise profit on strong sales of its revamped line of Barbie dolls.  Mattel\u2019s shares rose 20 percent, while those of Hasbro were down 5 percent by late morning.  While every major U.S. toy maker scrambled to find new avenues to sell toys after the sudden liquidation of the world\u2019s largest toy retailer, Hasbro\u2019s reliance on toys based on movie franchises compounded its struggles.  \u201cHasbro is very reliant on entertainment for success and their Disney licenses - Frozen, Star Wars and Marvel. In non-movie, non-entertainment years, those brands are not going to sell as well,\u201d said Jackie Breyer, editorial director at trade magazine the Toy Book.  The lack of Disney princess movies last year, for which Hasbro holds key licenses, also drove more pre-teens to Barbie dolls in the holiday season, allowing Mattel to take market share away from Hasbro in the dolls category.  Barbie added about $134 million to Mattel\u2019s sales in 2018 in the absence of direct competition from Hasbro\u2019s Disney Princess dolls, Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink said.  Hasbro\u2019s sales in Europe also took a hit from the bankruptcies of several specialty toy retailers and reduced spending in the United Kingdom ahead of Britain\u2019s impending exit from the European Union.  Lower inventory levels at European retailers was nearly as impactful as Toys \u201cR\u201d Us\u2019 liquidation to Hasbro\u2019s overall business, Chief Financial officer Deborah Thomas said, adding that the toy and games market in Europe was also shrinking.  BETTING ON DISNEY  Hasbro said it expects to return to revenue and profit growth in 2019, banking on a slew of new big budget Disney movie releases including \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d, \u201cAvengers: End Game\u201d and \u201cStar Wars: Episode IX.\u201d  A sequel to \u201cFrozen\u201d is also expected around Thanksgiving, which Hasbro says will boost sales through 2020, which Breyer says could crimp Barbie sales during the holidays.  The company\u2019s net revenue fell to $1.39 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 30, while analysts were expecting $1.52 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Excluding certain items, the company earned $1.33 per share, below the average analyst estimate of $1.67 per share.","190":"March 11 (Reuters) - Executive compensation and coronavirus are likely to be the focus of investor questions at Walt Disney Co\u2019s annual meeting on Wednesday - the first to feature the company\u2019s new chief executive officer, Bob Chapek.  Chapek is leading Disney at a time when coronavirus threatens revenue at the company\u2019s parks and on its cruises, and may keep movie fans away from theaters. Chapek also needs to keep the Disney+ streaming service competitive as new rivals launch this year.  Former CEO Bob Iger, who stepped down from that post on Feb. 25 but remains at the company as executive chairman, will focus on content creation until he retires at the end of 2021.  At the meeting in Raleigh, N.C., shareholders will not officially vote on Chapek\u2019s compensation - only on a pay plan for named executives, which do not include him, in fiscal year 2019 which ended Sept. 28. That plan set Iger\u2019s 2019 compensation at $47.5 million, according to a Jan. 17, 2020 filing.  But Julian Hamud, senior director at proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis, said via e-mail that the vote \u201cwill be a bit of a blurred line covering both Mr. Chapek\u2019s new package and the pay for Mr. Iger\u2019s shift to executive chairman. Both transitions are quite expensive, and it was not lost on us that Mr. Chapek\u2019s employment agreement explicitly states that he reports to the executive chairman.\u201d  Glass Lewis advised shareholders to oppose the 2019 executive pay plan in a non-binding vote, as did other proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Egan-Jones. \u201cSpecifically, the CEO\u2019s base salary is more than double that of company peers at $3 million,\u201d ISS wrote in its own report.  Disney has previously faced criticism over Iger\u2019s pay, which was $65.6 million in the company\u2019s 2018 fiscal year, up 80% from the previous year. At its 2017 annual meeting, Disney suffered a rare rebuke when a majority of shareholders opposed its executive pay in a non-binding vote.  In the current proxy statement, the company acknowledged the pushback, stating that during the fiscal year 2019, members of management and the board spoke with 11 of the company\u2019s top 20 shareholders and contacted approximately 74% of its largest 50 investors, \u201cseeking input on compensation and governance matters.\u201d Based on that feedback, Iger agreed to reduce his compensation on three different occasions.  In his new role as chairman, Iger\u2019s employment agreement will continue unchanged. So until he retires at the end of 2021, Disney will be paying for both Iger and Chapek, whose compensation is set at a minimum of $25 million annually.  The Florida State Board of Administration, which manages pension assets for Florida state and other local authority employees and had 2.3 million shares of Disney as of the end of 2019, voted against the compensation plan this year. \u201cIt seems to be maximized for payout without sufficient ties to the performance levels,\u201d said Jacob Williams, corporate governance manager with the organization.  In a March 5 filing, Disney defended the plan, writing that \u201cIger\u2019s compensation in fiscal 2019 reflected the considerable value he generated for the company and its shareholders, with the completion of the acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox and implementation of the company\u2019s transformative direct-to-consumer strategy, culminating in the successful launch of Disney+.  More than 90% of Iger\u2019s compensation is performance-based, and under his leadership since 2005, Disney has delivered total shareholder return of 559%, compared to just 223% for the S&P 500 as of fiscal year-end 2019.\u201d (Reporting by Helen Coster in New York; additional reporting by Ross Kerber in Boston; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)","191":"FILE PHOTO: Security officers staff the entrance at the Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Florida, U.S. June 13, 2016.

It has also come under pressure to delay the July 11 reopening of its Orlando, Florida-based Walt Disney World.  Disney began closing its theme parks around the world in January in response to the spread of the novel coronavirus. Disney in early May said measures to contain the pandemic had cuts its profits by $1.4 billion, most from its shuttered theme parks.

(Reuters) - AT&T Inc T.N in May will launch its HBO Max streaming service with a new \"Game of Thrones\" series at the current HBO price of $15 a month in an aggressive move to battle Netflix, Disney and Apple for the future of TV.  The logo for WarnerMedia's new HBO Max service is seen in this handout photo obtained on October 25, 2019. WarnerMedia\/Handout via REUTERS\/File Photo  The price, which many expected to be higher, surprised the financial analysts and investors attending the WarnerMedia presentation on Tuesday.  HBO Max is expected to reach 75 million to 90 million global subscribers by 2025, with about 50 million of these coming from the United States. The new service is expected to generate about $5 billion in U.S. revenue by 2025.  The stakes are high for AT&T, which is saddled with debt from a $134 billion acquisition spree to combine media conglomerate Time Warner and satellite TV provider DirecTV with the second-largest U.S. wireless phone company by subscribers.  The success of HBO Max is in many ways a referendum on a strategy to merge content with the means to distribute it.  HBO, which invented high-end, subscription programming, is playing catch-up in the streaming era dominated by Netflix.  To compete, AT&T has committed to invest up to $4 billion in additional HBO Max content by 2025, executives said, just a day after reporting tepid media results for the third quarter.  The investment falls far short of its biggest rival Netflix Inc NFLX.O, which has earmarked $15 billion in cash on content spending in 2019. But AT&T and WarnerMedia executives believe they have content and ways to get it in front of consumers that are lacking at Apple Inc AAPL.O, Walt Disney Co DIS.N and Amazon.com AMZN.O.  WarnerMedia Chief Executive John Stankey this month told Reuters that HBO Max will be available this spring to 10 million current AT&T customers in the United States -- a mix of wireless, satellite TV, and some HBO Now subscribers -- at no extra charge.  \u201cThe price point of $14.99 for HBO Max strikes a good balance between not cannibalizing HBO\u2019s existing revenue base, while also addressing the competitive environment in streaming television,\u201d said Sam Hendel, president of Levin Easterly Partners and a portfolio manager at the firm, which owns about 3.5 million shares of AT&T. \u201cThe HBO Max content offering is extremely robust and I think it will be well received by investors and consumers.\u201d  NOT WALMART  From Stage 21 on the Warner Brothers Studio lot in Burbank, California, executives demonstrated the breadth of new original programming and the depth of WarnerMedia\u2019s extensive library of films and TV series. They included the entire collection of DC Universe superhero film franchises from the last decade such as \u201cBatman\u201d and recent box office hits such as \u201cJoker\u201d that will be available within the first year of its launch. WarnerMedia also secured the U.S. streaming rights to \u201cSouth Park.\u201d  To court new viewers, WarnerMedia executives said they will introduce 88 original series in 2021, 38 from HBO and 50 under the category it called \u201cMax Originals\u201d that will target younger audiences.  Executives announced a batch of new shows from high-profile producers and directors including \u201cRaised by Wolves\u201d by \u201cAlien\u201d filmmaker Ridley Scott about androids raising human children and \u201cCollege Girls\u201d from comedian, actress and writer Mindy Kaling.  Ahead of the presentation, HBO canceled a much-anticipated prequel to the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d starring Naomi Watts, one source familiar with the matter said, confirming reports in Hollywood media.  Instead, WarnerMedia executives announced 10 episodes of a new \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d prequel called \u201cHouse of Dragons.\u201d The series will be set 300 years before the events of the just-concluded series and is based on author George R.R. Martin\u2019s book \u201cFire & Blood.\u201d  Although the Warner Brothers library includes popular content like \u201cThe Shining\u201d and \u201cScooby-Doo\u201d -- and the HBO brand is known for edgy, high-quality programming -- it does not have the same brand awareness as Pixar, Marvel or Disney properties that will be included in the Disney+ streaming service that launches Nov. 12.  And as one of the latest entries in the streaming wars, HBO Max will be competing for household dollars that may have already been allocated to rivals.  WarnerMedia is hoping that with HBO Max, it can continue serving HBO\u2019s core over-40 audience, and expand to include younger viewers who may prefer to stream content and do not want to pay for cable.  \u201cThis is not Netflix. This is not Disney. This is uniquely HBO Max,\u201d AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said.","197":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window)  * JPM rises after Q1 profit beat  * Anadarko jumps on Chevron\u2019s $33 bln deal  * Disney up after pricing streaming service  * Indexes up: Dow 1.01%, S&P 0.70%, Nasdaq 0.45% (Updates to open)  By Shreyashi Sanyal and Sruthi Shankar  April 12 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 crossed the 2,900 mark for the first time since early October on Friday, boosted by a jump in Walt Disney shares and as bank stocks surged after strong results from JPMorgan.

The S&P 500 is just 1.1% away from a record high hit in September.  Data from China showed exports rebounded in March but imports shrank for a fourth straight month and at a sharper pace. The data, which eased concerns about a slowdown in world\u2019s second largest economy, as well as a jump in oil prices offered support to global equities.  Grabbing the spotlight in the energy sector was Chevron Corp\u2019s $33 billion offer to buy smaller rival Anadarko Petroleum Corp. Shares of Anadarko jumped 32.2%, while Chevron fell 5.3%.

Holdings also included $3.2 million of Expedia and $10.1 million of Ford Motor CoF.N, whose debt rating was downgraded to junk after the coronavirus crisis hit.  The Fed also held $7.97 billion in 16 corporate bond exchange traded funds (ETF), the data showed. Roughly half of the corporate bond ETF shares purchased went to funds owned by BlackRock, which is managing the Fed\u2019s corporate credit facilities. BlackRock waived asset management fees on ETFs purchased on behalf of the Fed.  Other global central banks have bought individual corporate bonds for years, but the program is new for the Fed during this pandemic. The aim is to ensure companies can continue to finance themselves, and not be forced into bankruptcy because they are unable to raise needed cash.  The program is backed by investment capital from the U.S. Treasury to absorb any losses from defaults.  The Fed has reduced the pace of corporate bond purchases made in the secondary market from about $300 million daily to slightly less than $200 million a day, and it could stop the purchases entirely if market conditions keep improving, Daleep Singh, executive vice president of the New York Federal Reserve said this week.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  (Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOXA.O shares dropped more than 2 percent on Monday, as investors viewed the absence of a new bid by Comcast Corp CMCSA.O for most of Fox's assets as meaning its bidding war with Walt Disney Co DIS.N for them is likely over.  Disney fended off Comcast\u2019s $66 billion all-cash challenge to its deal for the Fox assets last month by sweetening its offer to $71 billion in cash-and-stock. Time is running out for Comcast to come back with a new offer, with Fox shareholders scheduled to vote on the Disney deal on July 27.  CNBC reported on Monday, citing sources, that Comcast was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d to make a new offer for the Fox assets. However, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Comcast CEO Brian Roberts has kept his arrangements with banks in place to make a new offer, but he has not communicated his intentions or made a final decision.  Comcast would not be required to make a new announcement about walking away from the main Fox assets, according to the sources, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. It would be very difficult for Comcast to press on a new bid if it did not come this week, according to the sources.  Fox declined to comment. Comcast and Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  A new bid from Comcast for the Fox assets, which include its movie studio and several TV networks, would stretch the cable operator's finances, given that it has also offered $34 billion to acquire 61 percent of European broadcaster Sky Plc SKYB.L. Fox, which owns 39 percent of Sky, has been also seeking to acquire the majority stake.  Comcast has also been seeking to convince Fox and investors that regulators would approve its bid for the main Fox assets after U.S. Department of Justice gave the green light to Disney's bid for them. However, the Justice Department's decision last week to appeal against the loss of its challenge to AT&T Inc's T.N takeover of Time Warner Inc served as a reminder that risks persist of antitrust measures.  Walking away from the main Fox assets would give Comcast less negotiating leverage with Disney and Fox to end the bidding war for Sky. Several analysts have suggested that the two bidding wars for the main Fox assets and Sky could have been resolved with some kind of grand bargain between Comcast and Disney.  The fight between Disney and Comcast has been part of a bigger battle being waged in the entertainment industry as the growth of Netflix NFLX.O and Amazon AMZN.O force the world's traditional media giants to spend tens of billions of dollars to keep pace.","204":"FILE PHOTO: 21st Century Fox Executive Co-Chairmen Rupert Murdoch (L) and his son Lachlan attend the first day of the annual Allen and Co. media conference in Sun Valley, Idaho July 8, 2015.

James, younger son of the media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, decided months ago that he will pursue an opportunity of his own after quitting Fox, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.  Lachlan and Rupert Murdoch will serve as co-chairmen of the new Fox, while current Chief Financial Officer John Nallen will also take the role of chief operating officer.  Fox agreed last year to sell the bulk of its film and TV assets to Walt Disney in a $52.4 billion deal. It expects to ask shareholders for approval of the transaction this summer.

Tennis - US Open - Mens Final - New York, U.S. - September 10, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Segar  Disney and Comcast are battling to win Fox's movie and television studios at a time when legacy media and distribution companies are looking to expand to better compete with younger media firms like Netflix Inc NFLX.O that sell their content directly to viewers. Fox\u2019s international assets such as Star India appeal to both Disney and Comcast, which want to expand their global presence.  While Fox\u2019s board has yet to make a decision, analysts and industry dealmakers widely expect Fox to say that Comcast\u2019s bid could potentially lead to a better deal for its shareholders. If it does, Fox would then be allowed to negotiate with Comcast and take a closer look at its offer. This would be the time for Fox to learn more about Comcast\u2019s commitments when it comes to regulatory approval, for example.  \u201cLet the ping-pong tournament begin, as Comcast won\u2019t let Fox brush off its all-cash premium offer without a fight,\u201d Macquarie analyst Amy Yong said in a research note last week.  Once Fox engages in talks with Comcast, it will then have to determine if the offer is definitively a superior deal for Fox shareholders, compared with its agreement with Disney. This will be the first step that could lead to a bidding war as Disney will then have five business days to put a revised offer on the table, according to its merger agreement.  Disney could sweeten its all-stock bid with cash, given its strong balance sheet and the potential boost to earnings per share, according to the people familiar with the matter.  Technically, Fox could also rebuff Comcast\u2019s bid on Wednesday, but that is unlikely, said Morningstar analyst Allan Nichols.  \u201cBecause of the liabilities of the board I don\u2019t think they can outright say no to Comcast\u2019s offer. You at least need to do some kind of review process,\u201d he said.  TAX, ANTITRUST CONCERNS  In its review, Fox will need to decide whether Comcast\u2019s richer, all-cash offer is enough to offset the antitrust risk and potentially higher tax liabilities for some of its shareholders, analysts said.  A U.S. court's recent approval of AT&T Inc's T.N merger with Time Warner Inc TWX.N raised the likelihood that Comcast's similar proposed deal with Fox would get the green light from regulators, they said.  However, there are still concerns that some aspects of the proposed deal could complicate an antitrust review, they added.  Craig Moffett, an analyst at Moffett Nathanson, said that the Justice Department never addressed the question of whether internet providers such as Comcast could give an advantage to its own content at the expense of competitors.  For example, Comcast could give its internet subscribers easier or faster access to content from Hulu, which it would gain control over by buying Fox, than that of other media streaming services, the analysts said.  If an all-cash bid does eventually beat a stock offer, it could have a bigger tax hit on Rupert Murdoch, Fox\u2019s largest shareholder, who controls 17 percent of the company\u2019s voting shares along with his family.  Reuters previously reported before the details of Comcast\u2019s offer were made public that the financial impact on Murdoch would be big enough for him to prefer an all-stock transaction, which would be nontaxable for all Fox shareholders.  That potentially puts Murdoch, who remains the most powerful voice inside the company, at odds with some Fox shareholders who would be open to abandoning the Disney deal if Comcast\u2019s cash offer was high enough.","206":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window)  * U.S. services sector activity hits 16-month high in July  * Biggest daily pct gain for Disney since late March  * Energy stocks gain as oil prices jump  * Dow up 1.2%, S&P 500 up 0.66%, Nasdaq up 0.55% (New throughout, updates prices, market activity and comments; new byline, adds NEW YORK dateline)  NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks climbed on Wednesday in the wake of a surprise quarterly profit from Disney and as investors hailed signs that a deal was near for a U.S. coronavirus fiscal aid package.

With 384 companies in the S&P having reported earnings through Wednesday morning, results are coming in 23.5% above expectations, in aggregate, according to Refinitiv data, the highest on record back to 1994.  Economic data painted a mixed picture, as U.S. services industry activity gained momentum in July, according to an ISM survey, with new orders jumping to a record high. However, hiring declined, supporting views that a recovery in the labor market was faltering.

Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA.O said on Tuesday Sky News could be sold on to U.S. rival Walt Disney Co DIS.N or become a legally separate business within the Sky group.  Fox agreed in December 2016 to buy the 61 percent of European pay-TV group Sky it does not already own, but the deal has been repeatedly delayed by the UK government and regulators.  Fox had already promised that Sky\u2019s 24-hour news service would remain independent under the ultimate control of Murdoch, but critics, including some high-profile politicians, remain adamantly opposed due to Murdoch\u2019s record of influence through owning the Sun and the Times newspapers.  The delay enabled U.S. cable giant Comcast Corp CMCSA.0 to gatecrash the deal in February by saying it would offer 12.50 pounds a share to buy Sky, compared with Fox's 10.75 pounds - although it has not yet made a formal bid.  As the Sky deal remained in regulatory limbo, Fox separately agreed to sell a string of assets, including its 39 percent stake in Sky, to Disney, potentially taking Murdoch out of the Sky equation.  Fox said on Tuesday its new concessions went beyond the steps that Britain\u2019s media regulator Ofcom said would mitigate concerns about Murdoch\u2019s influence.  The company, however, needs to persuade another regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), and the government.  \u201cWe have worked diligently with the CMA throughout its extensive review,\u201d it said.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cIn fact, we believe that the enhanced firewall remedies we proposed to safeguard the editorial independence of Sky News addressed comprehensively and constructively the CMA\u2019s provisional concerns.\u201d  MATCHING COMCAST?  Fox said it could legally separate Sky News within the wider Sky group, so it would operate independently with guaranteed funding for 15 years.  Alternatively, it said Disney had expressed an interest in acquiring the 24-hour news channel, whether or not Disney\u2019s proposed acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox went ahead.  Fox senior vice president Gerson Zweifach said the solutions addressed all concerns about the transaction.  \u201cWe look forward to concluding this acquisition - finally - in a timely and expeditious manner,\u201d he said.  Sky shares were up 0.9 percent at 13.09 pounds at 0906 GMT, above both the agreed offer from Fox and the proposed bid by Comcast.  Analysts at Liberum said Fox\u2019s latest concessions should be enough to secure approval. They also said that two factors pointed to Fox coming back with a revised bid to match Comcast.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  First, Fox must have received approval from Disney to offer the concession, they said, and second, Sky said its independent directors remained focused on maximizing value for shareholders.  Separate news on Tuesday that Sky Italia had settled its long-running fight with Mediaset in the Italian pay-TV market also made Sky more valuable, they added.  A group of high-profile British lawmakers, including former Labour party leader Ed Miliband, called last month for Murdoch to be blocked from buying Sky, despite the promises Fox had already made to ensure the independence of Sky News.  The four said the promises did not go far enough, given Murdoch\u2019s record of influence.  The group could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday.  Fox said on Tuesday a group of politicians was seeking to influence the CMA, adding they were making \u201ca number of unsupported and fanciful assertions\u201d.","208":"FILE PHOTO: Tennis - US Open - Mens Final - New York, U.S. - September 10, 2017 - Rupert Murdoch, Chairman of Fox News Channel stands before Rafael Nadal of Spain plays against Kevin Anderson of South Africa.

Walt Disney World in Florida reopened in July to limited attendance. But with record-breaking coronavirus infection rates in Florida, can Disney avoid the fate of its Hong Kong park, which reopened only to be closed again as cases spiked?  MEDIA NETWORKS  Analysts are expecting the division to be dragged down by sharp declines at ESPN. They are forecasting a $1.97 billion quarterly profit, compared with a $2.1 billion profit during the same period last year.  ABC missed out on the NBA Finals during the quarter; the league restarted its season on July 30. Major League Baseball\u2019s restart on July 23 - which set TV ratings records on ESPN - has been clouded by a COVID-19 outbreak among Miami Marlins players, causing the league to postpone games. A financial rebound from the return of live sports is uncertain.  STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT  Theaters are starting to reopen, but Disney has postponed the theatrical release of \u201cMulan\u201d and other potential blockbusters. A few smaller movies that had been scheduled to debut in theaters were moved to Disney+.  Analysts expect the studio to post operating income of $356 million, a 55% decline from a year earlier. How and when will Disney fully resume movie production, and what are its plans for films that are already completed?  DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER AND INTERNATIONAL  Disney+ is expected to be a bright spot in the third quarter, as viewers remained at home.

(GRAPHIC: Disney vs Netflix - )  Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings warned in September that competition arising from the entrance of Apple AAPL.O, Disney and NBC to the global streaming market would spark a surge in content costs, adding to worries about Netflix's already slowing subscriber growth.  Apple earlier this month launched its streaming video service, with a slim offering of original shows, for $5 per month, compared to Netflix\u2019s $13 per month standard price.

Hostar\u2019s parent Star India has the exclusive digital and TV broadcast rights to the cricket league.  The Disney+ Hotstar service will be available in three plans - a basic, ad-supported free plan, a second-rung plan priced at 399 Indian rupees ($5.29) a year and the most expensive at an annual 1,499 rupees ($19.88), which will gives subscribers access to Disney+ original shows as well as American shows from studios such as HBO, Fox and Showtime.

Netflix\u2019s shares fell about 4 percent after Disney priced its streaming service, Disney+, at $6.99 per month, below the video streaming pioneer\u2019s basic plan of $8.99.  \u201cInvestors find a lot of promise in Disney\u2019s offerings because it\u2019s well positioned to fight the likes of Netflix for consumers\u2019 money,\u201d said Clement Thibault, analyst at global financial markets platform Investing.com.  Shares of Disney jumped 10 percent to $128.26, adding $21 billion to the company\u2019s market capitalization of $209 billion on Thursday.  J.P. Morgan analysts also noted that Disney+\u2019s interface appears similar to that of Netflix with personalization of user profiles, recommended content, search capabilities and parental controls.  Disney+ will launch on Nov. 12 in the United States, featuring content from a host of Disney brands including Marvel, Star Wars and Pixar as well as recently acquired Fox properties such as \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and National Geographic programming.  Disney said it expects to attract between 60 million and 90 million subscribers and achieve profitability in fiscal year 2024. It plans to plow a little over $1 billion in cash to finance original programming in fiscal 2020 and about $2 billion by 2024.  \u201cIt\u2019s still very early on, but the streaming war has officially begun. By fighting back with a competitive offering, Disney at least gives itself a chance to win in the streaming industry, rather than just losing user after user to other streaming services,\u201d Thibault said.","225":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window)  * JPM kicks off earnings on a high note, boost bank stocks  * Anadarko tops gains on S&P after Chevron\u2019s $33 bln deal  * Disney shares hit a record after pricing streaming service  * Indexes up: Dow 0.89%, S&P 0.55%, Nasdaq 0.33% (Updates to early afternoon)  By Shreyashi Sanyal and Sruthi Shankar  April 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Friday, lifting the S&P 500 above the 2,900 mark for the first time since early October, boosted by gains in Walt Disney shares and as bank stocks surged after strong results from JPMorgan.  Shares of the largest U.S. bank by assets rose 4.8% after the company beat quarterly profit estimates, easing fears that slowing economic growth could weigh on its results.  The S&P financial index rose 1.74%, providing the biggest boost to the main index, while the S&P banks index gained 2.26%.  Stocks have been in a holding pattern ahead of the first-quarter earnings season, which many analysts say could be the first quarterly drop in S&P 500 profit since 2016.  Shares of Wells Fargo & Co fell 2.7% after the lender cut its forecast for 2019 net interest income, while PNC Financial Services Group Inc rose 2.9% after its first-quarter profit met estimates.  \u201cExpectations for this earnings cycle have been subdued, but after results from these big financials it shows that things have started off really well.

Analysts project earnings growth at S&P 500 companies to decline 2.3 percent in the first quarter as the impact of tax cuts fade and worries about global growth come to the fore. Bank earnings are expected to grow 3%, according to Refinitiv data.  However, investors are hoping that the earnings season will be better than feared, helping the U.S. indexes reach all-time highs. The S&P 500 is just 1.3% away from a record high hit in September.  The S&P 500 total return index hit a record high on Friday, underscoring the importance of reinvesting dividends.

Anadarko Petroleum Corp jumped 32.6%, topping gains on the S&P 500, after Chevron Corp said it would buy the company in a cash-and-stock deal.  The S&P energy index was up about 0.44%, with peers Devon Energy Corp, EOG Resources Inc and Pioneer Natural Resources Co gaining between 3% and 11%.

Local trading volumes were largely subdued due to the holiday season. U.S. equities fell into a tailspin on Christmas eve as investors fretted over a number of political issues, ranging from the convening of a crisis group to reports of President Trump considering the sacking of the Federal Reserve Chairman. The drop created ripples across most equity markets around the globe. \"These are incredibly tricky markets to decipher as the outsized moves are not reflective of the current U.S. economic landscape, but that seems to matter little so far as fear mongering continues to permeate every pocket of global capital markets,\" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore. Local equities followed suit, with Singapore's index shedding more than 1 percent to drop to its lowest since late-October. Losses in the island state were largely broad-based, with financials and industrials serving as the biggest weights on the benchmark. Shares of Lender DBS Group shed nearly 1.6 percent, while those of industrial conglomerate Jardine Matheson Holdings fell 2.2 percent. Inflation in Singapore slowed slightly in November, implying that the Monetary Authority may face lesser inflationary pressure to tighten policy in the future. The Thailand benchmark index edged up slightly after slipping to its lowest level since May 2017, as oil and gas heavyweight PTT PCL's counter took some support from a mild rebound in oil prices. The index had plunged more than 2 percent on Tuesday after data showed that Thailand's manufacturing production rose lesser than expected in November, which may put some pressure on exports from the country in 2019. Vietnam shares moved between positive and negative territory.

The company is considering the idea as one way to make the public feel safe about returning to Disney\u2019s parks once they are allowed to open again for business, Iger told Barron\u2019s.  \u201cOne of the things that we\u2019re discussing already is that in order to return to some semblance of normal, people will have to feel comfortable that they\u2019re safe,\u201d Iger said. \u201cSome of that could come in the form ultimately of a vaccine, but in the absence of that it could come from basically, more scrutiny, more restrictions.\u201d  \u201cJust as we now do bag checks for everybody that goes into our parks, it could be that at some point we add a component of that that takes people\u2019s temperatures, as a for-instance,\u201d Iger added.

Walt Disney World, the most-visited theme park in the world, attracted 58.4 million visitors in 2018, according to the Themed Entertainment Association.

Disney vs Netflix as streaming war looms:  Verizon said all its new and existing unlimited wireless customers, as well as new Fios and 5G Home internet customers, will be eligible for a free, one-year subscription to Disney+. The service will cost regular subscribers $7 monthly or $70 annually. A bundle that includes ESPN+ and Hulu will cost $13 a month.  Disney will be paid by Verizon in a \u201cwholesale\u201d deal arrangement, Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger said in a CNBC interview. The agreement \u201cwill have a significant effect ... in terms of jumpstarting subscriptions,\u201d he added.  As of the second quarter, Verizon served 118 million wireless subscribers, with about half of them purchasing unlimited service, the company has said.  Verizon and Disney are taking a page out of Apple Inc\u2019s playbook by giving a free year\u2019s worth of the video service, to quickly build a subscriber base.  Apple plans to give away a one-year subscription here to Apple TV+ for all purchasers of new Macs, iPhones and Apple TV devices. The service is set to launch on Nov. 1.  Analysts estimate Apple could sell as many as 200 million of its latest iPhones to existing users upgrading their old phones.  The Verizon deal gives Disney an advantage in the so-called streaming wars, in which companies like Netflix, Amazon.com Inc, Comcast Corp and AT&T Inc compete for streaming video subscribers.  Analysts at research firm Cowen noted that Verizon recently reduced the price of its unlimited plans by $5 per month to encourage customer uptake in preparation for 5G.  Fewer than half of Verizon\u2019s customers are on unlimited plans, Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said on the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call.  Verizon had 124 million customers across wireless and Fios internet in the second quarter.  The move by Disney and Verizon puts added pressure on AT&T, which is announcing details of its forthcoming HBO Max streaming service at an investor day presentation on Oct. 29. AT&T has not yet released pricing or distribution details for the new service.  Last year, Verizon shut down its go90 advertising-supported streaming video service after a three-year run, after failing to reach younger viewers. It had invested millions to acquire sports and content rights from short-form video producers.","229":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co\u2019s live-action remake of \u201cMulan\u201d pulled in $23.2 million over the weekend at box offices in China, a slow start for the big-budget epic about a Chinese folk hero in its most important theatrical market.

Verizon and Comcast representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Comcast on Nov. 14 offered to acquire most of Fox\u2019s assets in an all-stock deal valued at $34.41 per share, the filings said. Fox ended up announcing an all-stock deal with Disney for $29.54 per share.  Like Disney, Comcast sought to buy Fox\u2019s entertainment networks, movie studios, television production and international assets, the documents show.  In the filing, Disney and Fox said the ongoing antitrust scrutiny of U.S. telecommunications provider AT&T Inc's T.N planned merger with media conglomerate Time Warner Inc TWX.N heightened concerns about potential regulatory hurdles to Comcast's bid. The U.S. Department of Justice has sued AT&T and Time Warner to thwart their deal, and the case is in court.  The companies added that, unlike Disney, Comcast declined to offer a reverse deal termination fee, which would compensate Fox in the event that regulators stymied a deal. Disney offered a reverse termination fee of $2.5 billion.  The companies also said that Fox saw Disney\u2019s stock as more valuable than Comcast\u2019s, based on historic prices, and felt that a deal between Disney and Fox would generate greater long-term value. The Roberts family controls Comcast through a dual-class stock structure.  Comcast\u2019s proposal, on the other hand, would reduce the compensation offered to Fox shareholders in the event that asset sales were required to reassure antitrust regulators, increasing the potential risk to Fox shareholders, the filing said.  Verizon\u2019s bid was rejected because it offered to acquire Fox at market value, without a meaningful premium, according to the filing.","237":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co DIS.N on Monday received unconditional approval from China for its deal to buy Twenty-First Century Fox's FOXA.O entertainment assets, clearing one of the last major hurdles for the deal to go through.  Disney agreed to purchase Fox\u2019s film and television assets for $71.3 billion and received approval from European Commission earlier this month, subject to certain conditions.  Other major U.S.-centric merger deals in the past year have run into trouble with Chinese regulators, against the backdrop of growing trade tensions.  The Fox assets being acquired include a cable group with FX Networks, National Geographic and 300-plus international channels, plus Fox\u2019s stake in Hulu.  The deal would expand Disney\u2019s unrivalled portfolio of some of the world\u2019s most popular characters, uniting Mickey Mouse, Luke Skywalker and Marvel superheroes with Fox\u2019s X-Men, \u201cAvatar\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d franchises.  Disney owns ABC, ESPN, Pixar, Marvel Studios and \u201cStar Wars\u201d producer Lucasfilm, plus an array of theme parks.  Disney shares rose 1 percent to $117.34, while those of Fox were up 3 percent at $49.60.","238":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co DIS.N on Thursday debuted its new ESPN+ digital subscription service, the first consumer offering in the traditional media company's push to become a leader in streaming entertainment.  The service will carry more than 10,000 live sporting events that are not shown on television, as well as exclusive on-demand programing such as a new documentary about controversial college basketball coach Bobby Knight.  ESPN and other cable networks have been losing pay TV subscribers as audiences rapidly migrate to online services such as Netflix Inc NFLX.O. Disney is trying to adapt to the switch by developing its own streaming offerings.  ESPN+ may lose money for \u201csome number of years, not huge\u201d as the company works to lure enough subscribers to cover programing investments, said Kevin Mayer, chairman of Disney\u2019s direct-to-consumer and international unit.  During a briefing at ESPN\u2019s studio in downtown Los Angeles, Mayer told reporters he expects the service will become profitable and will provide valuable insight for other Disney streaming services.  \u201cThis is strategic for us,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cThis is a multi-year effort. It\u2019s going to take some time to assess how it has performed.\u201d  ESPN+ is designed for fanatics who want more sports programing, and for people who cannot find their favorite teams or sports on TV, Disney executives said. The latter includes fans of cricket, rugby, Canadian football or Ivy League sports.  The service is offered as an add-on inside a newly designed ESPN mobile app or through ESPN.com. It costs $4.99 a month, or $49.99 per year.  \u201cIt is an opportunity for us to serve sports fans in new ways, and in ways no one else can,\u201d ESPN President Jimmy Pitaro said.  Programing includes one live Major League Baseball game each day during the regular season, starting with the San Diego Padres and San Francisco Giants on Thursday. Customers also will see Major League Soccer games, college sports from 20 U.S. conferences, and boxing and Grand Slam tennis matches that do not air on TV. A daily National Hockey League matchup will be added starting with the 2018-2019 season.  ESPN+ does not include Monday Night Football or National Basketball Association games that are shown on ESPN\u2019s TV channels. Those are reserved for subscribers of pay TV packages, who can stream the live TV lineup through the ESPN app. The redesigned app allows customers to watch up to four streams simultaneously on one screen.","239":"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp CMCSA.O offered $65 billion on Wednesday to lure Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOXA.O away from a merger with Walt Disney Co DIS.N, setting up a bidding war between two of the largest U.S. media companies with its 20 percent higher offer.  Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts said he was highly confident regulators would allow Comcast to acquire most of Fox's media assets after AT&T Inc's T.N court victory on Tuesday, which allowed it to buy Time Warner Inc TWX.N for $85 billion.  The fight to win Fox\u2019s assets is shaping up to be a summer blockbuster starring well-known media moguls, led by Rupert Murdoch who built Fox into a global media empire. Comcast\u2019s Roberts, who led a failed bid for Disney in 2004, now faces off against Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger, whose own dealmaking has added heroes from Pixar, Star Wars and Marvel comics to the home of Mickey Mouse.  Fox\u2019s board will now have to decide whether Comcast\u2019s offer beats Disney\u2019s. If Fox prefers Comcast, Disney will have five business days to respond.  Comcast may have a tough time winning over Fox\u2019s largest shareholder, the Murdoch family. They own a 17-percent stake and would face a multi-billion dollar capital gains tax bill by accepting an all-cash offer from Comcast, tax experts previously told Reuters.  Fox shareholders will vote July 10 on the Disney transaction but the company could postpone the meeting, Fox said in a statement.  Some analysts see difficulties for Comcast-Fox, which would add Fox\u2019s movie and television studios to Comcast\u2019s NBC Universal, but Roberts said in a letter to Fox that he would offer the same conditions as Disney and promised to fight for the deal in court if necessary.  Comcast is expected to lead a wave of traditional media companies trying to combine distribution and production to compete with Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google. The younger firms produce content, sell it online directly to consumers and often offer lucrative targeted advertising.  A merger between Fox and Comcast would create a company with a stable of well-known media brands and franchises, such as the X-Men superheroes. A combined company would hold the rights to air Fox\u2019s long running TV show \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d, the U.S. rights to the Olympics and Premier League Soccer.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  Fox\u2019s international assets such as Star India appeal to both Disney and Comcast, which want to expand their global presence.  Major sports and news assets including Fox News, Fox Business Network and Fox Sports would be spun off into a separate company.  Shares of Comcast, Fox and Disney were barely changed in after-hours trade.  Comcast in a statement outlined an offer that was similar to Disney\u2019s, including a commitment to the same divestitures. It said that it would go to court and fight if the Justice Department tried to block the deal.  Comcast offered $35 per Fox share for the media assets, compared with Disney\u2019s stock offer, worth $29.18 per share at the close of trade on Wednesday.  Comcast offered a $2.5 billion reverse termination fee if the deal did not go through, the same as Disney. It also offered to pay Fox\u2019s $1.525 billion breakup fee owed Disney, if Fox went with Comcast.  Comcast said it intended to pursue its $30 billion acquisition of Sky Plc SKYB.L in parallel with its Fox bid. Comcast bid for Sky in April, after Fox's bid for the remainder of European pay-TV group it did not already own was delayed by regulators.  Fox in a statement said it had received the proposal and would review it.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  Justice Department lawyers who tried to stop AT&T\u2019s $85 billion deal expect consumers will lose out as bigger companies raise prices, and some lawyers saw that as a concern in a Comcast-Fox deal which would put two movie studios and two major television brands under one roof.  \u201cOne cannot ignore the fact that there\u2019s less independent content to go around,\u201d after the AT&T deal, said Henry Su, an antitrust expert with Constantine Cannon LLP.  Still, the AT&T court fight gave Comcast valuable information about how to structure a Fox deal, said David Scharf, a litigation expert with Morrison Cohen.  Disney itself has \u201csurgically\u201d structured a transaction that \u201cmight be doable,\u201d avoiding Fox Broadcasting and big Fox sports channels, U.S. antitrust chief Makan Delrahim said last week.  \u201cI don\u2019t think either will have a significant advantage over the other,\u201d given that both Disney and Comcast seem motivated to divest what they need to win a deal with Fox, said Ketan Jhaveri, a former Justice Department attorney who served on the telecommunications task force.","240":"(Reuters) - Shares of Walt Disney Co DIS.N fell 2% on Wednesday after the media giant's surprise move to replace top boss Bob Iger raised questions on Wall Street if his successor Bob Chapek had sufficient experience in the entertainment business.

While Wall Street analysts were largely positive about the change, some were skeptical.  \u201cBob Chapek has less (content experience), having spent his Disney career in distribution of content and\/or the physical world of parks, retail, and consumer products (ie, minimal storytelling, despite the fact that even he says that storytelling is at the center of Disney\u2019s value proposition),\u201d Needham analyst Laura Martin said.  Two former employees Reuters talked to expressed surprise that Kevin Mayer, chairman of Direct-to-Consumer and International, was not named to the top job, especially after the roll-out of the Disney+ streaming service, which attracted 10 million sign-ups in its first day.  Most analysts, however, agreed that the move ended years of speculation on who would take over Hollywood\u2019s most powerful studio, built up by Iger through acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and 21st Century Fox.  \u201cThe move takes CEO succession uncertainty off the table; we expect the markets to digest this news and ultimately give Chapek the benefit of the doubt as the new CEO,\u201d Cowen and Company analysts wrote in a note.

But the movie has run into controversy over its star\u2019s support of Hong Kong police and for being partly filmed in the Xinjiang region, where China\u2019s clampdown on ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims has been criticized by some governments, including the United States, and human rights groups.  Disney had originally planned for to release the film in theaters around the world in March but scrapped that plan when the novel coronavirus spread.  McCarthy said Disney ultimately decided to launch \u201cMulan\u201d online in markets where Disney+ is available because many theaters remained closed and surveys showed most people were not ready to return to theaters during the pandemic.  \u201cIt was not an easy decision to make because there were so many factors at play here,\u201d she said.  Samba TV, which tracks viewership on smart TVs, estimated that more than 1.1 million U.S. households paid $30 each to watch \u201cMulan\u201d on Disney+ between Friday and Monday.

FILE PHOTO: The water tank of The Walt Disney Co Studios is pictured in Burbank, California February 5, 2014. REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni\/File Photo  The total compensation is tied to the closing of Disney's planned $52.4 billion acquisition of film and TV assets from Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA.O and meeting performance targets.  Fifty-two percent of shareholders voted against Disney\u2019s compensation plan for Iger and other executives, the company said at its annual shareholder meeting in Houston. Forty-four percent cast ballots in favor and 4 percent abstained.  \u201cThe board accepts the result of today\u2019s non-binding vote and will take it under advisement for future CEO compensation,\u201d Aylwin Lewis, chair of the board\u2019s compensation committee, said in a statement.  Iger\u2019s continuation as chief executive is imperative in light of the planned Fox acquisition, Lewis said, noting that total shareholder return has more than quadrupled over Iger\u2019s tenure.  Iger has been CEO since 2005 and added the title of chairman in 2012.  Under the compensation plan, Iger would be paid up to $48.5 million in annual salary and bonuses if the Fox deal goes through, for each of the four years from 2018 to 2021.  Iger was also awarded an equity grant that could be worth about $100 million in 2021, according to proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services, which urged investors to vote against the pay resolution. Seventy-five percent of the grant is based on Disney\u2019s total shareholder returns compared with the S&P 500 Index.  Iger\u2019s compensation reached $36.3 million in fiscal 2017. His contract was extended through 2021 when Disney announced the Fox deal in December.  It is unusual for shareholders to vote against executive compensation. Just 1.2 percent of S&P 500 companies failed to win majority support for their advisory pay resolutions in 2017, according to ISS Analytics.  ISS said the \u201csubstantial\u201d payments to Iger tied to the Fox merger were \u201cconcerning.\u201d  \u201cWhile we acknowledge the need to retain critical leadership in anticipation of such a significant merger, the magnitude of the special equity grant ($100 million) is excessive,\u201d ISS said in a January report.  Lewis said the board had decided it was \u201cimperative\u201d for Iger to remain to oversee the integration of Fox businesses and that Fox also felt his continued leadership was \u201cessential.\u201d  Total shareholder return has jumped 414 percent during Iger\u2019s tenure, and Disney\u2019s market capitalization has climbed to $156 billion from $46 billion, Lewis added.  \u201cWe believe that the terms of Bob\u2019s extension are in the best interests of our company and our shareholders, and essential to Disney\u2019s ability to effectively maximize long-term value from this extraordinary acquisition,\u201d Lewis said.  The Fox acquisition is undergoing regulatory review that could take at least a year and has been complicated by Comcast Corp's CMCSA.O bid for one of the assets, Britain's Sky PLC SKYB.L.

The new streaming services include Disney+ and ESPN+.  By saving content for its own platforms, Disney estimates a decrease in year-over-year operating income of $150 million this fiscal year because it will forego licensing revenue from others, Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said on a conference call.

Overall, Disney\u2019s adjusted earnings-per-share declined 3 percent for the quarter from a year earlier as profit fell at the company\u2019s movie studio.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Warren, a progressive former U.S. presidential candidate, blasted the entertainment company for the layoffs that came as Disney reportedly restored pay for some executives who had taken cuts due to the pandemic, according to a letter the Massachusetts senator sent to Disney on Tuesday and seen by Reuters.  Warren described Disney\u2019s decision to pay dividends and buy back stock before the pandemic as \u201cshort-sighted,\u201d because it reduced the capital the company could have used to weather the downturn.  \u201cI would like to know whether Disney\u2019s financial decisions have impacted the company\u2019s decision to lay off workers,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cIt appears that \u2013 prior to, and during the pandemic \u2013 Disney took good care of its top executives and shareholders \u2013 and now is hanging its front-line workers out to dry.\u201d  In a prepared statement, Disney said Warren\u2019s \u201cmisinformed letter contains a number of inaccuracies.\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019ve unequivocally demonstrated our ability to operate responsibly with strict health and safety protocols in place at all of our theme parks worldwide, with the exception of Disneyland Resort in California, where the State has prevented us from reopening even though we have reached agreements with unions representing the majority of our Cast Members that would get them back to work,\u201d the theme park operator said.  Warren said she appreciated that Disney has continued to provide healthcare benefits to furloughed workers for the last six months.  Activist investor Daniel Loeb of hedge fund Third Point said the company should permanently end its dividend, after Disney suspended it in May, and invest in streaming programming instead.  Roughly two-thirds of the 28,000 workers Disney said last month it was laying off were part-time. Disneyland, the company\u2019s theme park in California, remains shut due to the pandemic.  Abigail Disney, the grand-daughter of Disney co-founder Roy Disney, has also criticized the company for how it has handled the pandemic.  Warren has been targeting executives who are under increased scrutiny as the economy falters from the pandemic, and as workers and other elected officials press them on issues such as racial justice and climate change.  Last month, she criticized CEOs for failing to keep a pledge backed by the trade group the Business Roundtable to consider social responsibility above shareholder profits.","254":"FILE PHOTO - The entrance to Walt Disney studios is seen in Burbank, California, U.S. August 6, 2018.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Sky, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox, Disney and Comcast are in the midst of complicated takeover battle that revolves around competing offers for the bulk of Fox\u2019s film and television assets and London-listed broadcaster Sky.  In December 2016, Fox offered 10.75 pounds-a-share to acquire the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own, only for Comcast to make a rival 12.50 pounds-per-share counterbid for the London-listed company in February.  At the same time, both Disney and Comcast are vying to acquire Fox\u2019s TV and film assets, which include Fox\u2019s 39 percent stake in Sky.  Disney last week raised its cash-and-shares offer for the Fox assets to $38-a-share from its original offer of $28-per-share, to trump a rival $35-a-share all-cash bid made by Comcast.  Britain\u2019s Takeover Panel said on Thursday that its executive was now examining the implications for Sky of Disney\u2019s improved offer for the Fox assets on June 20.  In April, the panel ruled that under its so-called \u201cchain principle\u201d, Disney must offer to buy all of Sky if it acquires Fox\u2019s 39 percent stake in the broadcaster, provided that neither Fox nor Comcast had already succeeded with their own offers for the British company.  At the time, the panel said Disney would need to offer Sky\u2019s minority shareholders 10.75 pounds-a-share if the U.S. giant was obliged to make a chain principle offer.  \u201cThe executive is considering what impact the 20 June increase (by Disney for the Fox assets) should have on the consideration payable under the chain principle offer and will make a further announcement in due course,\u201d the takeover regulator said on Thursday.  It added that it had \u201creceived submissions from a number of parties expressing diverging views in relation to this matter, including from Disney, Fox and the independent directors of Sky.\u201d  Fox\u2019s original 10.75 pounds-a-share offer valued all of Sky at 18.5 billion pounds, while Comcast\u2019s 12.50 pounds-a-share bid put a 22.1 billion-pound price tag on the British broadcaster.  If the panel now decides that Disney must make a mandatory offer for Sky that is higher than 10.75 pounds-a-share, it would essentially set a new floor under the price of the UK company\u2019s shares.  Sky stock was barely changed on Thursday, closing up less than 0.1 percent at 14.535 pounds.","264":"(Reuters) - Entertainment and media company Walt Disney Co on Friday said it has halted production on some live-action films for a short time on concerns over the rapidly spreading coronavirus.

The company told analysts in April that it expects Disney+ to achieve profitability in fiscal 2024.

REUTERS\/Benoit Tessier  LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Britain\u2019s Takeover Panel is in a tricky position. The M&A rule-maker, staffed largely by bankers and lawyers on secondment, said in April that Walt Disney\u2019s bid for Sky shareholder Twenty-First Century Fox requires it to buy out the rest of the British group. If that means Sky is due any price bumps seen by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s group, the usually risk-averse regulator could put fuel on an already hot bidding war.  The tangle stems from Disney and Fox\u2019s convoluted marriage. The Mickey Mouse owner last year agreed to pay Murdoch\u2019s group $28 per share in stock for assets including its 39 percent interest in Sky. Fox had already offered to buy the rest of the pay-TV group, and the panel said Disney had to extend the same offer to Sky\u2019s shareholders should Murdoch\u2019s bid fail. Further complicating matters, cable group Comcast has launched competing bids for Fox and Sky. That prompted Disney to hit back with a $38 per share bid for Fox, 36 percent above its previous offer.  Unsurprisingly, hedge funds invested in Sky argue that Disney owes them the same 36 percent bump. If so, that would incentivise shareholders in Sky to hold out until Disney takes over Fox and is forced to launch a sweetened buyout. Apply Disney\u2019s Fox bump to Sky, and those hedge funds would be entitled to 14.59 pounds per share - higher than Comcast\u2019s 12.50 pound offer and Fox\u2019s original 10.75 pounds.  That would make sense. Without a bump for Sky minorities, Murdoch\u2019s group effectively gets a better price for its slice than the pay-TV group\u2019s other shareholders - a no-no for Takeover Panel principles. Disney could attempt to justify this by arguing that its new, higher Fox bid relates to the U.S. assets rather than Sky. But that\u2019s hard to square with a recent filing, where the Mickey Mouse owner raised its Sky EBITDA forecasts by around a quarter for 2020 and 2021 to reflect lower soccer costs.  Unless the Takeover Panel wants to hand Murdoch a seemingly unfair victory, it\u2019ll have to put a floor under Sky\u2019s share price that\u2019s higher than anyone has bid for the pay-TV group. In the process, it would hand hedge funds a risk-free payday and undermine Comcast and Murdoch\u2019s bids just after they received antitrust clearance. Sky shareholders, who have bid its shares to 14.50 pounds, seem to be betting it will do just that.","270":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\u2019s entertainment arm has signed a licensing agreement with Walt Disney Co in a deal that will provide the Chinese group\u2019s Youku video streaming platform with the largest Disney animation collection in China.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - The price tag for Twenty-First Century Fox assets keeps increasing as Walt Disney and Comcast fight for bits of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s empire. Yet one number just gets smaller: the return on investment for whoever wins.  Disney and Comcast\u2019s dueling bids \u2013 and the parallel fight between Fox and Comcast over European pay-TV group Sky, in which Fox owns 39 percent \u2013 are being fueled by strategic necessity, ego and a devil-may-care approach to financial logic. Disney\u2019s last offer of $71.3 billion for Fox\u2019s entertainment and international assets is more than a third higher than what it initially agreed to pay last year.  The next step may be that Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts raises his offer too. He sweetened his bid for Sky by 18 percent on Wednesday. But Roberts starts on the back foot with Fox. The U.S. Department of Justice on June 27 approved Disney\u2019s transaction so long as it sells Fox\u2019s cluster of regional sports networks, which means the Mouse House can argue its bid is already close to being deliverable.  While the price escalates, what the bidders get stays the same. The Fox assets up for sale could contribute about $5.3 billion of operating profit in 2020, taking Fox\u2019s own estimates and deducting depreciation equivalent to around 2 percent of revenue. Fox\u2019s stake in Sky adds another $1 billion or so.  Then there are synergies, of which Disney is targeting $2 billion annually. Comcast reckons it can cut about the same, aside from any benefits if it snags Sky. Take the sum total of $8.3 billion and tax it at 21 percent, and whoever wins Fox will make back about $6.6 billion a year on their investment.  When Disney boss Bob Iger first offered $52.4 billion plus the assumption of $13.7 billion of debt, that would have meant a return of about 10 percent \u2013 higher than Fox\u2019s cost of capital of around 8 percent. Now it\u2019s just under that threshold. If Comcast ups the ante with a higher bid, the return will fall further, destroying value.  Iger and Roberts are both savvy acquirers and have deftly integrated past deals. But whoever loses out will have avoided a heap of integration risk, a mass of debt, and an investment that doesn\u2019t wash its face \u2013 while leaving their rival saddled with all three.","284":"Oct 1 (Reuters) - Gary Newman, who was incharge of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc\u2019s television studios, is in negotiations with the company to lead Fox Broadcasting after the Walt Disney deal, Variety reported on Monday.

The world\u2019s biggest video streaming platform by paid customers, Netflix told Reuters more than a million of its nearly 200 million subscribers around the world are in Southeast Asia, home to around 655 million people. But the market is ripe for rapid growth, analysts say, with the Disney+ Hotstar launch in Indonesia next month set to become a key battleground.  \u201cWhat we see in Southeast Asia is that it\u2019s a very mobile-centric market\u201d, Netflix director for product innovation Ajay Arora told Reuters in a recent interview. That\u2019s led the company to push cheaper mobile plans and adapt its product to fit lower-end smartphones, Arora said.  Southeast Asia is estimated to have generated $600 million in overall subscription music and video revenue in 2019, according to a study by Google, Temasek Holdings and Bain & Co - but that\u2019s set to explode to an annual $3 billion by 2025, the study said.  Starting with India in August 2019, Netflix has now launched mobile-only plans in Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia - all priced at below $5 a month. That\u2019s a departure for Netflix, which has held firm on pricing in Western markets.  Repeated coronavirus lockdowns across Southeast Asia have also increased the appetite for content streaming at home across the region. Consultancy Media Partners Asia estimates that Southeast Asia video streaming service subscribers will reach 14.7 million in all by the end of 2020.  Netflix executive Arora said his firm is also working to expand its payment options in countries with low credit and debit card penetration. In markets like the Philippines, subscribers can pay for Netflix through their mobile telephone plans, or by purchasing prepaid Netflix cards at convenience stores.  The company faces competition in the region not just from Disney+, a distant, but ambitious, global no. 2 in the industry. Other regional rivals include Hong Kong video service Viu, popular for its Korean dramas, as well as Chinese tech giant Tencent\u2019s WeTV, which in June bought the assets of Malaysian streaming platform Iflix.  Disney+ is currently in the middle of a hiring spree across the region and is expected to launch broadly in the coming months jointly with its Indian streaming platform Hotstar. Disney\u2019s family and superhero movies have proven consistent hits in Southeast Asia.  In Indonesia, the world\u2019s fourth most populous country with 270 million people, Disney+ said last week it would start operating in September in partnership with state-owned telco Telkomsel with a catalogue that will include more than 300 local movies.  Bracing for the challenge, Netflix Southeast Asia content lead Myleeta Aga told Reuters that the firm, which announced two new original Indonesian productions earlier last Thursday, places high importance on the region and will continue to ramp up local content offerings. She said Netflix expects to start filming projects in Indonesia and Thailand soon.

Reuters obtained a copy of the letter.  In May, Disney\u2019s board of directors said it would suspend payment of its semi-annual cash dividend for the first half of fiscal 2020.  A Disney spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company said in August that it would hold an investor day in the coming months to provide an update on its streaming strategy.  Disney shares rose 1.9% to $123.19 in afternoon trading on Wednesday.  Loeb added Disney to Third Point\u2019s portfolio some months ago when its shares were beaten down by worries over how theme parks and movie theaters would survive the global coronavirus pandemic.  Disney said in August it had attracted more than 100 million streaming customers worldwide in just the first nine months of its digital video push. Netflix boasts 193 million, but it got a head start in the streaming market 13 years ago.  While Loeb wrote that he did not want to intrude on Disney\u2019s basic business decisions, he left little doubt that he wanted the company to move more quickly to capture streaming subscribers.  Even though a more aggressive investment strategy may weigh on short-term earnings, Loeb argued that with time, investors would see a benefit.  \u201cTime is of the essence and the company should consider significant additional investments in content, both through production and acquisitions here and abroad,\u201d he wrote.  The letter, first reported by Bloomberg, struck a conciliatory tone with Loeb saying he looked forward to a \u201cconstructive dialogue\u201d with the company.  He also urged Disney to embrace home entertainment as the future, rather than movie theaters.  \u201cEvery Hollywood executive has been able to enjoy first-run movies in the comfort of their home for years,\u201d Loeb wrote. \u201cWe urge you to democratize this experience and to continue to embrace the future of home entertainment with the utmost urgency in executing the company\u2019s digital transformation.\u201d","292":"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp CMCSA.O dropped its $66 billion bid for Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's FOXA.O entertainment assets on Thursday but said it would still try to expand its international footprint by acquiring 61 percent of European broadcaster Sky Plc SKYB.L, the remainder of which is owned by Fox.  Comcast's withdrawal is a concession to Walt Disney Co DIS.N, which last month sweetened its offer for the Fox assets to $71.3 billion, in a bid to unite two storied Hollywood studios and several television networks under one corporate umbrella.  Comcast\u2019s move de-escalates one of the media industry\u2019s most high-profile confrontations, which pitted Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts against Fox Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch and Disney CEO Bob Iger. However, it still leaves the two companies competing to expand in Europe via a bidding war for Sky, which is 39-percent owned by Fox.  Fox has also made an offer for the 61 percent of Sky it does not own, although Comcast is currently the highest bidder with a 14.75 pounds-per share-offer, worth $34 billion, for the London-listed pay TV group.  Shares of Comcast, the largest U.S. cable company, rose 2.7 percent as investors were relieved the company did not try to outbid Disney further. Disney shares were up 1.6 percent.  Fox shares fell 1.2 percent and Sky ended down 1.5 percent. One of the reasons Comcast dropped its bid for the Fox assets was that the bidding war was inflating the value of Sky, given its partial ownership by Fox, according to sources familiar with the company\u2019s thinking.  \u201cWalking away from the battle for Fox at this price we think supports the view that (Comcast is) fine without it,\u201d said Jonathan Chaplin, analyst at New Street Research. \u201cIt remains to be seen how Sky wraps up, but we think it is highly unlikely that they would bid up to a price that would suggest desperation.\u201d  In a regulatory filing last week, Fox and Disney acknowledged for the first time they may not try to again outbid Comcast on Sky, though the sources stressed no decision has been taken.  Bernstein analysts have said Disney\u2019s debt pile could now hamper its ability to take on Comcast with a new bid for Sky, partly because it will need to invest even more to launch a successful direct-to-consumer streaming platform.  Disney and Fox did not immediately reply to requests for comment. On CNBC, Disney\u2019s Iger said he was \u201cextremely pleased with today\u2019s news.\u201d Fox and Disney shareholders will vote on their deal next week.  Comcast dropped its bid for the Fox assets because it was concerned the price was becoming too high, even though its banks were ready to finance a new bid, according to the sources. It was also worried how much revenue it would lose in divesting assets to appease U.S. antitrust regulators.  \u201cI\u2019d like to congratulate Bob Iger and the team at Disney and commend the Murdoch family and Fox for creating such a desirable and respected company,\u201d Comcast\u2019s Roberts said in a statement on Thursday.  Disney owns ABC, ESPN, Pixar, Marvel Studios and \u201cStar Wars\u201d producer Lucasfilm, plus an array of theme parks. The Fox assets being acquired include a cable group with FX Networks, National Geographic and 300-plus international channels, plus Fox\u2019s stake in Hulu.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Immediately before the acquisition by Disney, Fox will separate the Fox Broadcasting network and stations, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, its sports channels FS1, FS2 and the Big Ten Network, into a newly-listed company that it will spin off to shareholders.  SKY\u2019S THE LIMIT  The bidding between Comcast and Disney is part of a bigger battle in the entertainment industry as media giants splash out tens of billions of dollars on deals to be able to compete with Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  While an acquisition of Britain\u2019s Sky, a broadcaster of sports, films and TV shows to 23 million homes across Europe, would significantly diversify Comcast\u2019s business overseas, it would do little to give it scale in its core U.S. market.  \u201cOur view is that probably there is less chance of Fox\/Disney coming back with an increased offer for Sky given that Comcast would have more available firepower,\u201d said Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker.  Nevertheless, Sky shares ended trading at 15.09 pounds on Thursday, above Comcast\u2019s 14.75-pound-per-share offer, as investors continued to bet on a better deal. \u201cI don\u2019t think Disney wants to give up Sky,\u201d said Crispin Odey, whose eponymous hedge fund owns Sky shares.  Comcast was drawn into a bidding war for Fox because of the scarcity of big media assets up for sale, given that the industry is dominated by powerful families and personalities reluctant to cede control. CBS Corp CBS.N and Viacom Inc VIAB.O, for example, are tightly controlled by the Redstone family.  However, smaller media companies could become acquisition targets. Lions Gate Entertainment Corp LGFa.N rose 5.2 percent on investor speculation it could become an acquisition target. Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc and MGM Studios Inc are also seen as potential targets.  Comcast first made an offer for the Fox entertainment assets last November, but Fox decided to go with Disney, even if its bid was lower, because it believed a deal with Comcast would not win antitrust approval. The U.S. Department of Justice last month approved Disney\u2019s deal with Fox.","293":"HONG KONG, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co\u2019s Hong Kong theme park operator said on Tuesday its net loss for 2017 doubled to HK$345 million ($44.10 million), marking a third straight year of losses, due to park expansion plans and higher operating costs.  Hong Kong Disneyland, the company\u2019s smallest theme park, has been hit by slow local retail and tourism markets and suffered its first loss in four years in 2015.  Revenue for the fiscal year ended September 2017 rose 8 percent to HK$5.1 billion, buoyed by a 3 percent increase in number of visitors at 6.2 million.  The theme park saw an increase of 5 percent in the number of international visitors, touching a record high of around 1.6 million. More than 70 million guests have visited the park ever since it was launched in 2005, the company said.  In 2016, Hong Kong Disneyland said it would invest another $1.4 billion to expand the loss-making park.  Iron Man Experience, Disney Park\u2019s first Marvel-themed ride which was launched in January last year, now serves as the most popular attraction at the resort, it said.  The Hong Kong-based resort faces stiff competition from other theme park operators such as Ocean Park, which has been vying for mainland Chinese visitors.  Hong Kong retail sales ended a three-year slump in 2017, rising 2.2 percent, underpinned by a rise in tourist arrivals from mainland China and upbeat property and share prices that boosted sentiment.","294":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Gina Carano, the \u201cMandalorian\u201d actress who was dropped from the \u201cStar Wars\u201d spinoff over what the studio called \u201cabhorrent and unacceptable\u201d social media posts, said on Friday she will make a film with conservative company The Daily Wire.

The Daily Wire said Carano will produce and star in an upcoming film exclusively for subscribers to its website, which was co-founded by conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro.  In a statement on the site, Carano said she was sending a message of hope to everyone living in fear of cancellation by what she called \u201cthe totalitarian mob.\u201d  \u201cI have only just begun using my voice which is now freer than ever before ... They can\u2019t cancel us if we don\u2019t let them.\u201d  Carano also came under fire for posts on Twitter in November in which she derided mask-wearing amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and for promoting baseless claims of voter fraud after the U.S. presidential election.  Quoting sources, the Hollywood Reporter said Lucasfilm had been going to unveil Carano as the star of her own Disney+ series during a December investor\u2019s day presentation but scrapped those plans following her November tweets.  A Disney spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on that report.  Shapiro said The Daily Wire aimed to \u201cprovide an alternative not just for consumers, but for creators who refuse to bow to the mob.\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019re just as eager to show Hollywood that if they want to keep cancelling those who think differently, they\u2019ll just be helping us build the X-wing to take down their Death Star,\u201d he said in a statement on the Daily Wire website.","295":"* Philippines slumps as Q3 GDP growth slows, misses forecast * Wall Street rallies after U.S. midterms, boosting Asian shares * Indonesian shares hit 2-month high By Nikhil Subba Nov 8 (Reuters) - Most Southeast Asian stock markets rose on Thursday, as Wall Street rallied after U.S. midterm elections, boosting Asian equities, while the Philippines deepened its slump after data showed that economic growth slowed in the third quarter. Wall Street's main indexes rose more than 2 percent overnight, while Asian stocks climbed to a one-month peak, as Democrats won control of the House of Representatives and President Donald Trump's Republican party expanded its Senate majority, indicating the likelihood of a political gridlock in Washington. \"President Trump will have a lot more negotiations to do to in terms of rolling out his infrastructure development, additional tax cuts... and the market is taking that as a relief factor,\" said Taye Shim, head of research at Mirae Asset Sekuritas.

The Fed, however, is not expected to hike interest rates until its next gathering in December. The Fed has tightened monetary policy three times in 2018. Singapore shares rose as much as 1.1 percent, with industrials and financials leading the gains. Lender DBS Group Holdings climbed nearly 2 percent while industrial conglomerate Jardine Matheson Holdings rose 1.7 percent to a three-week high. Indonesian shares rose as much as 1 percent to their highest in two months on the back of gains in utilities. Malaysian shares rose 0.7 percent to a two-week high, boosted by wins in industrials. The Philippines stock index declined as much as 1.2 percent to a two-week low and was on track for its third straight losing session. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 6.1 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, below the 6.3 percent median forecast in a Reuters poll and slower than the previous quarter's upwardly revised 6.2 percent growth.

It is unclear why the Chinese government denied the request and Chinese authorities do not provide reasons to Hollywood studios when they disallow screening of their movies, the source said.  However, the decision has revived online discussion as censors have in the past targeted the film\u2019s main character, originally conceptualised by English author A.A. Milne, due to memes that compare the bumbling bear to President Xi Jinping.  China\u2019s Culture Ministry declined to comment and referred questions to the State Administration of Radio and Television, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  China, the world\u2019s second-largest film market, limits the number of foreign-made films allowed into the country to 34 a year. It typically favours action-heavy blockbusters such as \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther\u201d, two of four Disney films that have played in China so far this year.  Disney\u2019s \u201cA Wrinkle in Time\u201d, which debuted around the world in March, has not been released in China.  Netizens have in the past likened Pooh\u2019s appearance - namely his portly stature - to President Xi. A small number of people have even used Pooh as a symbol of resistance.  FILE PHOTO: Stuffed Winnie the Pooh and Eeyore characters are seen at the world premiere of Disney's \"Christopher Robin,\" in Burbank, California, U.S., July 30, 2018.

Other allusions include a popular comparison between a Winnie the Pooh car toy image and the Chinese leader presiding over a military parade from the back of a moving vehicle.  \u201cCan I still say Winnie the Pooh?\u201d posted several users on Weibo, a Chinese microblogging site, on Tuesday, testing censors by adding images of Xi and Pooh. The images, seen by Reuters on Tuesday, had been blanked out on the site by Wednesday.  \u201cIf they don\u2019t let it into China, the joke is going to become huge,\u201d said another commenter.  Taiwan\u2019s foreign ministry posted a message on its official Twitter account on Wednesday in response to the news that the movie would not be shown in China.  \u201cTaiwan\u2019s OhBear is dismayed at the ban slapped on his cousin Winnie\u2019s latest film by censors in China,\u201d it said, referring to its tourism mascot \u2018Oh Bear\u2019. \u201cMake no mistake: All bears are created equal in Taiwan and (the Christopher Robin) movie is screening nationwide.\u201d  While China\u2019s film regulator does not give direct feedback on specific movies, it has released regulations in the past that say it bars subversive themes, homosexual content and excessive violence.

Disney kicked off its presentation to Wall Street analysts at its Burbank, California, headquarters on Thursday with a video that demonstrated the breadth of its portfolio, showing clips from dozens of classic TV shows and movies from \u201cFrozen\u201d and \u201cThe Lion King\u201d to \u201cAvatar\u201d and \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d  The transformation of the Mouse House, as it is known, from a cable television powerhouse into a leader of streaming media could be Iger\u2019s final legacy as he told Wall Street analysts he would not extend his contract beyond 2021 and was working with the board of directors on a succession plan.  GLOBAL GROWTH  Executives said they see opportunities to take its ESPN+ sport streaming video service to Latin America and are looking into international expansion of its Hulu streaming video business, which offers movies and shows targeted to adults.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Disney also forecast Hulu\u2019s subscribers to reach 40 million to 60 million by fiscal 2024 and reach profitability in the United States by either 2023 or 2024. Hulu currently has 25 million subscribers and is expected to lose $1.5 billion in the current fiscal year.  The digital push is Disney\u2019s response to cord-cutting, the dropping of cable service that has hit its ESPN sports network and other channels, and the rise of Netflix Inc. The Silicon Valley upstart has amassed 139 million customers worldwide since it began streaming 12 years ago.  Disney will join the market at a time when audiences are facing a host of choices, and monthly bills, for digital entertainment. Apple, AT&T Inc\u2019s WarnerMedia and others plan new streaming services.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  To bolster its potential digital portfolio, Disney recently purchased film and TV assets from Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox and gained prized properties such as \u201cAvatar.\u201d  Disney had been supplying new movies such as \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d to Netflix after their runs in theaters but ended that arrangement this year to feed its own streaming ambitions. The company estimated it is foregoing $150 million in licensing revenue this fiscal year by saving programming for its own platforms.  The Disney+ programming will draw in part from Disney\u2019s deep library of classic family films. It also will include exclusive original content such as a live-action \u201cStar Wars\u201d series called \u201cThe Mandalorian,\u201d a show focused on Marvel movie villain Loki, and animated \u201cMonsters at Work,\u201d inspired by hit Pixar movie \u201cMonsters Inc.\u201d  Some new Disney movies, such as a \u201cLady and the Tramp\u201d remake, will go directly to the Disney+ app. Other new releases will appear on Disney+ after their run in theaters and after they cycle out of the home video sales window, executives have said.","306":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window)  * Trump says he has not agreed to roll back tariffs  * Disney rises after streaming expenses come in below projection  * Gap falls after surprise CEO exit  * Indexes: Dow falls 0.1%, S&P 500 up 0.08%, Nasdaq up 0.3% (Updates to late afternoon)  NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were near unchanged on Friday after President Donald Trump said he has not agreed to a rollback of U.S. tariffs sought by China, fueling doubts about the progress of trade talks between the two countries.

REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Sky investors on Tuesday received a mini Easter egg. Walt Disney is ready to buy the pay-TV group\u2019s news channel to smooth the regulatory process for merger partner Twenty-First Century Fox. This signal of Disney\u2019s commitment to owning the UK broadcaster boosts the odds of a bidding war with rival Comcast.  Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox has been stuck in regulatory limbo since late 2016, when the 39 percent shareholder in Sky launched an 11.7 billion pound ($16.5 billion) offer for the rest of the company. Britain\u2019s antitrust regulator said in January the deal could give Murdoch undue influence given his existing interests in the Sun and Times newspapers. But it also acknowledged that Fox\u2019s $52.4 billion December all-stock tie-up with Disney, which would make the \u201cStar Wars\u201d producer Sky\u2019s ultimate owner, offered ways around the problem.  Fox has come up with two new solutions that were published on Tuesday by the regulator. First, Sky News could be established as a distinct, \u201cring-fenced\u201d company inside Sky, with its own board and guaranteed funding for 15 years. That\u2019s a slightly stronger version of an idea which media watchdog Ofcom, the first regulator to review the deal, said would \u201cmitigate\u201d concerns.  Alternatively, Disney may pledge to buy Sky News. That would remove the political and regulatory heat from Fox\u2019s bid for the rest of Sky. Unlike Murdoch, Disney has no meaningful news business in Britain and would therefore pose less of a concern to regulators.  The U.S. company\u2019s willingness to countenance such a deal has more symbolic than financial significance. Loss-making Sky News is so small that its results aren\u2019t broken out in the parent\u2019s annual report. But the statement of intent is important given cable group Comcast lodged a possible offer in February that beat Fox\u2019s bid for Sky by 16 percent.  Disney boss Bob Iger is unlikely to be interested in the small, unprofitable news channel on its own. His readiness to buy Sky News therefore signals a clear commitment to owning Sky. That was previously uncertain since Disney has argued it could buy Murdoch\u2019s 39 percent without making a full bid, because owning Sky wasn\u2019t necessarily the main motivation of the wider tie-up between Fox and Disney. That argument looks disingenuous after Tuesday\u2019s move. There\u2019s a growing chance that Murdoch and Iger will try to outbid Comcast to get what they want.","308":"FILE PHOTO: Logo di The Walt Disney Company proiettato nella sede della Borsa di New York, Stati Uniti, 14 dicembre 2017 REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co said on Tuesday it had consolidated its television studios into two units as the company restructures operations to emphasize streaming media.

The Fox movie franchises and TV shows have been the subject of a bidding war between Disney and Comcast, both of which want to expand their own entertainment businesses to compete with fast-growing digital rivals Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc.  The deal does not include the nationally broadcast Fox News, Fox Business or Fox Sports networks.  If Disney prevails over Comcast, the combination would expand Disney\u2019s unrivaled portfolio of some of the world\u2019s most popular characters, uniting Mickey Mouse, Luke Skywalker and Marvel superheroes with Fox\u2019s X-Men, \u201cAvatar\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d franchises.  Disney owns ABC, Pixar, Marvel Studios and \u201cStar Wars\u201d producer Lucasfilm, plus an array of theme parks. The Fox assets being acquired include a cable group that includes FX Networks, National Geographic and 300-plus international channels plus Fox\u2019s stake in Hulu.

The controlling owner of the U.S. cable firm decided not to top rival Walt Disney\u2019s $71 billion bid for some assets of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Twenty-First Century Fox. He also backed down from an aggressive tilt at the Mouse House 14 years earlier. Given the eye-watering price Disney is paying, Roberts and his shareholders should come out the winners.  Instead, Comcast will focus across the Atlantic and attempt to win a bidding fight with Fox for pay-TV outfit Sky, for which Roberts has so far bid around $34 billion.  Disney CEO Bob Iger initially agreed in December to pay Fox shareholders $52.4 billion in stock for the media assets on offer. Comcast came back in June with a $65 billion all-cash bid just as the U.S. Department of Justice lost its case against AT&T\u2019s merger with Time Warner. Disney countered with the current price, and Fox shareholders are due to vote on the transaction next week.  In short, Roberts has forced Iger to pay more than 35 percent over his original offer and pushed the leverage-shy Disney boss into new territory: Breakingviews calculates that after the deal closes, Disney\u2019s debt will rise to more than three times EBITDA even if Fox doesn\u2019t first buy the 61 percent of Sky it doesn\u2019t own.  Aside from the balance sheet, Iger must also successfully integrate the sometimes rough-edged Fox properties with Disney\u2019s pristine and family-friendly brand. Iger has succeeded with prior acquisitions Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm, but Fox is on a larger scale and the deal comes at much more perilous time for traditional media firms under assault from the likes of Netflix.  Roberts\u2019 hostile lunge at Disney in 2004, aiming to capitalize on his target\u2019s weakness at the time, met resistance and shareholder doubt. He was smart to walk away. Since the start of 2008, Comcast\u2019s annual total return to shareholders has been a notch or two higher than Disney\u2019s.

The hotels at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland Paris will remain open until further notice, the company added.  The company\u2019s theme parks in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo remain closed after being shuttered earlier this year in response to the coronavirus outbreak, which started in China.  Disney\u2019s stock ended down 13%, on a day when Wall Streets major indexes all slumped about 10%.  No cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, have been reported at the parks in Anaheim, California, a company representative said in a statement. The announcement coincided with statewide restrictions on public gatherings ordered by California Governor Gavin Newsom.  Comcast Corp's CMCSA.O Universal Studios theme park near Los Angeles also will close on Saturday with plans to reopen on March 28, the company said.  Newsom ordered a statewide ban on most non-essential gatherings of more than 250 people, including sporting events, business conferences and concerts, but his directive exempted casinos and theaters, as well as theme and amusement parks.  Disney said it decided to voluntarily close its Southern California parks \u201cin the best interest of our guests and employees\u201d after reviewing Newsom\u2019s directive.  As of Thursday, 198 coronavirus cases have been documented in California, including four deaths, Newsom said.  California is one of a handful of states, along with New York, that have adopted such drastic \u201csocial distancing\u201d measures, designed to limit transmission of the highly contagious respiratory virus by curtailing close contacts among people. Ohio and Maryland have ordered statewide closures of public schools.  Disney-run hotels in Anaheim will remain open through Monday to give guests time to make travel arrangements, the company said. Disney will pay its employees during the shutdown and refund payments for hotel bookings, it added.  Located about 30 miles (48 km) south of Los Angeles, the two Disney parks drew 28.6 million visitors in 2018, according to the Themed Entertainment Association.  Disneyland, which opened in 1955, is nicknamed the \u201cHappiest Place on Earth.\u201d The adjacent California Adventure park was added in 2001.  After Disney\u2019s announcement, S&P revised Disney\u2019s credit outlook to negative from stable, citing event cancellations and travel restrictions due to coronavirus.  \u201cThe negative outlook on Disney reflects the increased uncertainty around the extent of the impact of the coronavirus crisis on the global economy,\u201d S&P said.  It is unusual for Disney to close its theme parks. Brief shutdowns have occurred due to hurricanes and following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States.

(Reporting by Diane Bartz)","332":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Quarterly reports next week from Walt Disney Co, CBS and Viacom will likely highlight increasing competition in video streaming and could spark volatility in the so-called communication services sector, which has outperformed since it was overhauled last year.  The S&P 500 communication services index has increased 20% so far in 2019, beating the S&P 500\u2019s 17% gain and all but two of 11 sectors - technology and real estate. That strong performance is in large part thanks to a recovery by Facebook Inc, as investors bet that the world\u2019s largest social network will keep growing, even as it faces regulatory hurdles.  June-quarter results from Disney, CBS Corp and Viacom Inc will keep investors fixated on a rising wave of competition in video streaming against market leader Netflix Inc. All those companies fall within the communication services sector.  Netflix\u2019s stock has sunk 14% since it reported on July 17 that it unexpectedly lost U.S. subscribers in the second quarter, rattling investors already worried about the upcoming launch of Disney\u2019s streaming service.  Disney\u2019s family-friendly Disney+, set to launch on Nov. 12 with a slate of new and classic TV shows and movies, is viewed as the most dangerous threat to Netflix. Disney\u2019s shares hit a record high on Monday and have surged 28% this year.  \u201cThere is an analysis that has been going on among investors, looking at the number of subscribers Netflix has and the growth that Disney\u2019s service could put up in the next three or four years, and the huge disparity in the two companies\u2019 valuations,\u201d said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.  The recent increase in Disney\u2019s shares and decline in Netflix\u2019s shows that investors expect Disney to significantly dent Netflix\u2019s leadership in streaming, Carlson said.  Disney\u2019s stock is trading at 22 times expected earnings, its highest forward earnings valuation since 2004, according to Refinitiv data. Netflix\u2019s forward earnings valuation has dipped to 66 from 82 in early July, before its disappointing quarterly report.  Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., August 2, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Smaller players CBS and sister company Viacom have also built advertising-supported and subscription video services to compete with Netflix, and they are providing original content to other distributors.  Beyond streaming, investors watching Disney\u2019s report on Tuesday will focus on its recent run of box office hits, including \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d which has increased Disney\u2019s lead position at the U.S. box office. Disney owns the five-highest grossing movies of 2019, led by \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d and \u201cCaptain Marvel.\u201d  \u201cThe Netflix disappointment and the big Disney box office numbers underscore the importance of intellectual property, of ownership of content,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. Even though Netflix makes many of its own shows, it still relies on other producers, he said.  Netflix is losing its two most-watched shows in the United States - \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cThe Office\u201d - to upcoming rival services from AT&T Inc and NBC Universal in 2020 and 2021, respectively.  Viacom and CBS, both controlled by the Redstone family\u2019s National Amusements Inc, have worked out a management structure that would see Viacom Chief Executive Officer Robert Bakish leading the combined company if a merger deal is reached, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday, removing a major roadblock in talks to recombine the corporations.  In addition to looking for potential confirmation of that deal when CBS and Viacom report their results on Thursday, investors will focus on growth in CBS\u2019s All Access and Showtime streaming services.  Viacom could also give details about its strategy to sell programming to video streaming services, including its Paramount Television unit\u2019s \u201cJack Ryan\u201d TV series, based on the character created by author Tom Clancy, which premiered last year on Amazon Prime.  Long viewed as stodgy stocks for dividend-oriented investors, the telecom services sector was renamed communication services last September and supercharged with internet heavyweights Alphabet Inc, Facebook, Netflix and Twitter Inc, along with videogame makers. It was the biggest shakeup of the Global Industry Classification Standard, or GICS, since it was created in 1999. It has gained 5% since then, while the S&P 500 is unchanged over the same period.  CBS and Viacom have both gained about 15% in 2019.  Helped by its $71 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox\u2019s assets, Disney is expected by analysts to report a 41% jump in fiscal third-quarter revenue to $21.5 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Analysts on average expect earnings per share of $1.75. Disney\u2019s EPS has met or exceeded consensus estimates in six of the past eight quarters.  \u201cMy guess is the company will want to focus on content and investors will want to hear more about the streaming strategy,\u201d Ablin said.","333":"WASHINGTON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday said Walt Disney Co\u2019s ABC unit has agreed to pay a $395,000 civil penalty after an October 2018 episode of \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d used a simulated wireless alert tone.

Last month, pay-TV provider Comcast attempted to intrude on Disney\u2019s agreement to acquire Fox with a $65 billion cash bid. Disney has since raised its agreed upon price to around $71 billion in cash and stock.  Silver hinted that in the fight for Fox, he was rooting for Disney, which pays his league richly to carry its games. The NBA struck a more than $20 billion deal with Disney and Turner Broadcasting in 2014 for its games to appear on ABC, ESPN and TNT.  \u201cI am a big (Disney CEO) Bob Iger fan of course. Disney is one of our partners so in a way I\u2019m rooting for them,\u201d Silver said.  He added that Comcast CEO Brian Roberts \u201cis a superb executive as well,\u201d and that the cable company\u2019s regional sports networks carries its basketball games.  Silver said he is also looking forward to working with pay-TV provider AT&T Inc T.N, the new home of its games on Turner, as it integrates the acquisition of Time Warner Inc TWX.N.  Silver said that interest from technology companies such as Amazon AMZN.O in sports rights is also \"positive\" and that tech is giving fans a better experience watching media across devices such as smartphones and tablets.  Live sports remains valuable for advertisers because viewers are willing to pay and watch it for long periods in real-time.  While there is increasing competition between broadcasters, technology companies and cable operators for live sports, analysts have said sports rights could face pressure in the future as media firms consolidate and get more pricing power.  Last month, the NBA extended Silver\u2019s contract until the 2023-24 season and under his leadership it has become one of the most business savvy sports leagues.  The NBA has found new revenue streams in recent years such as selling advertising on its players\u2019 jerseys.","335":"LOS ANGELES, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Actors who had objected to Walt Disney Co\u2019s proposed coronavirus safeguards at the Walt Disney World theme park have reached an agreement to return to work, according to a union statement on Wednesday.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The reopening of Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure Park that was earlier scheduled for July 17 will be delayed until Disneyland receives an approval from state officials, the company said.  In late January, the pandemic started battering businesses across Disney\u2019s global portfolio when the company shuttered Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland.  Disney closed Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida - the company\u2019s largest theme park - in March. The park is scheduled to reopen on July 11, although petitioners are pressing Disney for a delay, citing a spike in COVID-19 cases in Florida.  Last month, Disney estimated global lockdown measures aimed at fighting the spread of the contagion slashed its profit by $1.4 billion, mostly from its shuttered theme parks.  In a June 11 report, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger wrote that Disney is losing about $1 billion a month while parks are closed, relative to what it otherwise would have earned.  The coronavirus-ravaged U.S. economy has begun to reopen but there is little clarity either on the pace and durability of the recovery, with new cases in the country continuing to rise.  \u201cThe challenge is twofold: the longer the delay, the more money Disney loses. I also think the larger question is what\u2019s happening to demand - the longer this health crisis goes on, the more people delay their thoughts about travel,\u201d said LightShed Partners media analyst Richard Greenfield. \u201cIf Disneyland is uncomfortable opening, can they really open Disney World?\u201d  Last week, unions representing 17,000 workers at Disneyland expressed concerns to the state\u2019s governor that the theme park would not be safe enough to reopen by the company\u2019s target date.  Like other major companies, Disney is confronting both the coronavirus pandemic and renewed calls for racial equity. On Thursday it announced it was \u201cretheming\u201d its \u201cSplash Mountain\u201d theme park ride, based on the controversial 1946 film \u201cSong of the South.\u201d  Disney said the ride, at Disneyland and Magic Kingdom park in Florida, would now feature characters from the animated film \u201cThe Princess and the Frog,\u201d which starred its first Black princess.","346":"PARIS (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Company DIS.N announced a 2 billion euro ($2.5 billion) investment to expand its French theme park Disneyland Paris after taking full control of the business last year.  FILE PHOTO: Disney characters attend the 25th anniversary of Disneyland Paris at the park in Marne-la-Vallee, near Paris, France, March 25, 2017. REUTERS\/Benoit Tessier\/File Photo  Chief Executive Bob Iger announced the spending plan after meeting President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, saying it reflected the U.S. media group\u2019s positive view on France and Europe more widely.  \u201cThis investment...is the direct result of the growing confidence that we have in the economy of Europe and in France in particular,\u201d Iger said in a video posted on the French Presidency\u2019s twitter account.  However, Iger suffered a blow on Tuesday when U.S. cable giant Comcast CMCSA.O offered to buy European broadcaster Sky for $31 billion, potentially derailing Disney's own bid for assets owned by Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA.O.  The Disneyland development will include three new areas based on Marvel superheroes such as Spider-Man and the Hulk, Disney\u2019s animated film Frozen and Star Wars, and will be rolled out in phases, starting in 2021. There will also be new attractions and live entertainment experiences.  \u201cThe expansion plan is one of the most ambitious development projects at Disneyland Paris since its opening in 1992 and underscores the company\u2019s commitment to the long-term success of the resort as Disney\u2019s brand beacon in Europe,\u201d Walt Disney said in a statement.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  TOURISM REBOUNDS  Macron, a former investment banker pushing through social and economic reforms, said Iger\u2019s financial commitment reflected renewed investor belief in France.  \u201cYour confidence shows that France is back,\u201d Macron said in his own tweet.  Disneyland Paris is Europe\u2019s most visited theme park. It sits on a 2,230-hectare site about 32 kilometres (20 miles ) east of Paris, though only half of site has been developed so far, according to the company\u2019s 2016 annual report.  With more than 320 million visitors passing through its turnstiles since 1992, the park accounts for 6.2 percent of France\u2019s tourism income and has been a boon for local employment, employing some 16,000 staff.  Even so, Euro Disney faced deep financial troubles after making overly optimistic projections on visitor numbers and taking on too much debt.  Walt Disney took control of the ailing company in June 2017 and de-listed its shares.  Its new investment drive comes amid a rebound in French tourism after the industry was weakened by a series of Islamist militant attacks in Paris, Nice and other cities.  Euro Disney racked up a net loss of 858 million euros in 2016 as visitor numbers fell 10 percent to 13.4 million.  However, 2017 marked the French capital\u2019s best year for tourism in at least a decade.  Disneyland Paris comprises two theme parks - the fairytale-themed Disneyland Park and the Walt Disney Studios Park. Its seven hotels have some 5,800 bedrooms, two convention centers and a golf course.","347":"Dec 2, 2017; Detroit, MI, USA; Henry Cejudo (red gloves) fights Sergio Pettis (blue gloves) during UFC 218 at Little Caesars Arena.

It is unclear when Disney\u2019s other parks in Asia, the United States and France would again welcome visitors, executives said, or when the company\u2019s range of idled businesses including retail stores and cruise ships would return.  Disney said it will not pay a dividend for the first half of the fiscal year, which will preserve $1.6 billion in cash assuming it had kept the dividend constant at 88 cents per share.  Bob Chapek, who became Disney\u2019s chief executive in February just as the novel coronavirus was spreading around the globe, said Disney would reopen the Shanghai park on May 11.  The Chinese government has asked Disney to cap attendance at 30% of capacity, or roughly 24,000 people, Chapek said. Disney will restart operations with \u201cfar below\u201d that number for a few weeks while it adjusts to new safeguards including social distancing, masks and temperature screenings, he said.  \u201cWhile it\u2019s too early to predict when we\u2019ll be able to begin resuming all of our operations, we are evaluating a number of different scenarios to ensure a cautious, sensible and deliberate approach to the eventual reopening of our parks,\u201d Chapek said.  Just three months ago, Disney was boasting about a record year for its movie studio and a strong start to the company\u2019s dive into the streaming media wars.  In late January, the coronavirus started battering businesses across Disney\u2019s global portfolio when the company shuttered Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland.  By mid-March, all of the company\u2019s theme parks were closed, movie theaters went dark, and television and film production were put on hold. Plus, Disney\u2019s ESPN sports network was left with no major live sports to broadcast.  \u201cIn total, we estimate that the COVID-19 impacts on our current quarter income from continuing operations before income taxes across all of our businesses was as much as $1.4 billion,\u201d Disney said, adding that $1 billion of that came from losses at theme parks.  Disney posted adjusted earnings per share of 60 cents for January through March, down 63% from a year earlier and short of the 89 cents expected by analysts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net income from continuing operations dropped 91% to $475 million.  Shares of Disney fell 2.8% in after-hours trade to $98.30, after losing 2% during the regular session. Before the earnings report, Disney\u2019s shares had lost more than one-quarter of their value this year.  Disney is expected to take a larger hit in the current quarter, which ends in June. The company said it does not intend to provide financial guidance for the rest of the year.  It has taken steps to cut costs, including putting 120,000 employees on furlough, according a filing with securities regulators.  Executives, whose salaries have also been reduced, said they were optimistic that Disney would rebound once the coronavirus crisis subsides.  \u201cI have absolute confidence in our ability to get through this challenging period and recover successfully,\u201d said Executive Chairman Bob Iger, who stepped down as CEO in February.  Iger opened the call with a statement about Disney\u2019s history of resilience before handing over to Chapek to address the company\u2019s unprecedented challenges.

The division lost $812 million in the just-ended quarter, less than the analyst forecast of $861 million.  At the parks, experiences and products division, operating income dropped 58% from a year earlier to $639 million.  Media networks, which include ESPN and broadcaster ABC, reported profit of $2.4 billion. That was a 7% increase from a year earlier, boosted in part by the addition of the FX and National Geographic Networks purchased from 21st Century Fox.  Profit at the movie studio fell 8% from a year earlier to $466 million. Disney released Pixar movie \u201cOnward\u201d just before theaters closed, then quickly moved it to video on demand for home viewers.

The strong performance, which added $18 billion to its market capitalization, appears to establish Disney as a leading player in the streaming wars that pit it against industry leader Netflix Inc NFLX.O, Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O Prime Video service, Apple Inc's AAPL.O Apple TV+ and AT&T Inc's T.N forthcoming HBO Max service.  Combined with Disney\u2019s other streaming businesses - Hulu, which has 26.8 million subscribers, and ESPN+, which serves 3.5 million subscribers - the company now serves 40.3 million viewers in the United States, compared to about 60 million for Netflix.  Disney shares rose 7.5% to $149 in late day trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Disney+, which launched in the United States, Canada and the Netherlands on Tuesday, was hit with technical glitches that the company said were caused by higher-than-expected demand.  The service costs $7 per month and features roughly 500 movies and 7,500 TV episodes from the company\u2019s deep family entertainment catalog, as well as new programming. A bundle including ESPN+ and Hulu costs $13.  In April, Disney said it plans to reach 60 million to 90 million Disney+ subscribers globally by 2024.  In a note on Wednesday, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote that at its current pace, Disney could hit that subscriber goal potentially two years earlier.  PROMOTIONS  Although Disney\u2019s day one numbers were more than three times the size of some forecasts, it was not immediately clear how many of these new customers were from free promotions.  In October, Disney and telecom provider Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N announced a promotion that made all new and existing Verizon unlimited wireless customers, as well as new Fios and 5G home internet customers, eligible for a free, one-year subscription to Disney+.  Ahead of the launch, Disney executives said they expected between 17 million to 19 million new subscribers as a result of the Verizon promotion. Verizon told Reuters in October it expected even more of its customers to have access to the deal.  Disney said it had no future plans to release Disney+ subscriber data outside of the company\u2019s quarterly earnings calls.","352":"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co DIS.N and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOXA.O were sued for more than $1 billion on Monday by casino operator Genting Malaysia Bhd GENM.KL, which accused them of abandoning a contract related to its planned construction of the first Fox-branded theme park.

Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Dan Berger, a spokesman for Twentieth Century Fox Film, one of the defendants, declined to comment.  The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles as Disney prepares to complete its $71.3 billion purchase of many Fox assets, expected in the first quarter of 2019.  Genting said the problems began as Fox engineered years of delays to force a renegotiation of the contract, which did not give it a share of gate sales.  But according to the complaint, Disney is now \u201ccalling the shots,\u201d and wants to end the contract because associating with a gaming company didn\u2019t fit its \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d brand strategy.  Genting said Fox issued a default notice with the hope of terminating the contract, in a manner \u201centirely consistent with Disney wanting to kill the deal\u201d to benefit itself.  \u201cGiven that FEG had no right to terminate the Agreement, Fox and Disney are liable for what will exceed a billion dollars in damages attributable to the bad-faith behavior of both Fox and Disney,\u201d the complaint said.  Genting said it had already made a \u201c$750 million-plus investment\u201d in Fox World. It is also seeking punitive damages.

Disney\u2019s forecast for significant growth in paying customers in the next few years was disclosed in a presentation of its streaming video strategy to Wall Street.  Operating losses for ESPN+ are expected to be $650 million annually in both fiscal 2019 and 2020, Disney\u2019s chief financial officer, Christine McCarthy, said during an investor day webcast presentation. But the service, which launched one year ago, should reach profitability by 2023, she said.  \u201cI view this positively because I think that they need to illustrate the subscriber growth to validate the investment.

Disney launched ESPN+ a year ago as a way to test its streaming services and distribute additional sports content directly to fans, for a monthly or yearly fee.  Since then, ESPN+ has drawn millions of subscribers, inked sports rights deals, and seen its mobile app rise in popularity. Disney is also moving forward with its larger plans for Disney+, which will stream its trove of new and classic blockbuster movies.  As for current paying sports fans, Disney said the number was currently over 2 million, or roughly what it disclosed in February.  Disney\u2019s own estimates about ESPN+ growth seemed slightly higher than analysts, though its time frame was longer.  Morgan Stanley analysts expect 2.7 million people to be paying for ESPN+ access by the end of fiscal 2019 and 3.9 million by the end of fiscal 2020. By 2022, it could have 6.7 million, Morgan Stanley said.  MoffettNathanson gave a more modest outlook, predicting that ESPN+ will end fiscal 2019 flat, with just 2 million subscribers, growing to 4 million by 2022 and 5 million by 2023.

Chairman and CEO of The Walt Disney Company Bob Iger speaks next to the character of Minnie Mouse at the unveiling of her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles, California, U.S., January 22, 2018. REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni -  Disney suffered a rare rebuke from its shareholders last week when a 52 percent majority opposed the compensation of Iger and other executives in a non-binding vote that could encourage the board to tweak the pay package.  ISS Analytics, the data arm of proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services, estimated that if Iger hits maximum goals the package would make him the 12th-highest paid U.S. CEO on an annual basis in the past 10 years.  Disney did not put a total value on Iger\u2019s pay package.  Markus Hansen, senior research analyst at Vontobel Asset Management, which had 2.4 million Disney shares at year-end, praised Iger\u2019s performance but said the firm voted against the compensation with the view the four-year pay package could be too easy to collect.  Under a contract extension through 2021 Iger could receive the full value of $100 million in stock awards tied to a deal to buy film and television assets from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOXA.O even if Disney's total shareholder returns are middle-of-the-pack versus other big companies.  While the metrics are not unusual, the feedback the board should take from the shareholder vote is that \u201cthe amount is large, so maybe a reduction in the amount and an increase in the performance targets\u201d would be in order, Hansen said.  Jacob Williams, corporate governance manager for pension overseer Florida State Board of Administration, said it voted its 2.2 million Disney shares against the compensation on similar concerns. It also had concerns about the lack of a clear succession plan after Iger leaves.  \u201cYou hate to see a payout of that magnitude for short-term performance,\u201d Williams said. He said however that a reorganization Disney announced on Wednesday had assuaged some succession concerns.  To be sure, some investors would be pleased if Iger earned the top number. Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, said he voted 150,000 shares for Disney\u2019s compensation plan because other media companies also pay well and Iger\u2019s Fox deal looks smart.  \u201cIf he succeeds, then you pay the guy,\u201d Gerber said.  Compensation consultant Brent Longnecker said the vote could spur the board to re-examine Iger\u2019s performance goals, though he did not expect major change.  \u201cI assume they won\u2019t ignore it,\u201d Longnecker said of the vote.  Asked about the pay estimate and investor concerns, a Disney spokesman referred to comments after the vote from Aylwin Lewis, chair of the company\u2019s compensation committee.  Lewis had said the board will take the vote result under advisement for future CEO compensation. Iger is \u201cimperative\u201d for Disney to keep as it absorbs Fox, Lewis said, with the CEO\u2019s value illustrated by a total shareholder return of 414 percent during his tenure. Iger became CEO in 2005.  Iger made $36.3 million in the twelve months ended Sept. 30.  The analysis by ISS Analytics done at the request of Reuters showed the agreement could yield Iger roughly $423 million over four years if he hits all goals, or $274 million as the base case targeted by the board.  The analysis assumed that the Fox deal closes early next year and excluded elements such as stock appreciation.

The blizzard of new content announcements in a marathon investor day presentation also came with bold new business targets - and programming costs of up to $16 billion in fiscal 2024 - as Disney races with U.S. entertainment industry rivals to catch up to video streaming pioneer Netflix Inc.  By the end of fiscal 2024, Disney expects to attract as many as 350 million global subscribers across all of its streaming services, easily more than double the 137 million it has today. Armed with fresh content, Disney will also raise the price of Disney+ by $1 in the U.S. to $7.99 per month and by 2 euros in continental Europe to 8.99 euros ($10.92).  The aggressive push comes as Disney taps into a home entertainment boom stoked by the global coronavirus pandemic, with more people staying indoors and seeking out new shows. Launched less than a year ago, Disney+ has already hit 86.8 million subscribers, Disney said, nearly reaching the upper end of a goal its previously set for 2024.  \u201cIt is clear our strategy has already positioned us as a leading global streaming service provider, and that is within just one year of launching Disney+,\u201d Disney Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said.  Disney said it plans to release 10 new TV series each in the Marvel and Star Wars franchises, including two spinoffs of \u201cThe Mandalorian,\u201d over the next few years..  Another 15 live-action Disney Animation and Pixar shows and 15 Disney Animation and Pixar feature films will be available on the Disney+ streaming service.  Customers should expect about 100 or more titles every year, executives said in the presentation to investors.  The company announced new programming for Hulu and Star, a general entertainment service it will launch overseas in February. This will include content from the popular Kardashian family, which this year announced it was ending its long-running reality show on NBCUniversal\u2019s E! network..  Disney said it continues to expect Disney+ will reach profitability in 2024, and shares rose 4% in after-hours trading during the investor presentation.  CLOSING THE GAP  The U.S. entertainment industry has scrambled to match Netflix this year. Disney, AT&T\u2019s WarnerMedia and Comcast Corp\u2019s NBCUniversal have all restructured operations to focus on streaming video services.  On Thursday, Disney set higher subscriber targets, fueled by billions of dollars invested in new programming. The company estimated it would spend between $14 billion to $16 billion on content in fiscal 2024.  FILE PHOTO: A Baby Yoda toy is pictured during a \"Star Wars\" advance product showcase in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., February 20, 2020. REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri\/File Photo  Disney+ is now expected to reach 230 million to 260 million customers by 2024, up from a previous projection of 60 million to 90 million.  The company said between 30% to 40% of the new subscriber forecast came from Disney+ Hotstar in India.  Disney+ has been boosted by the popularity of \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d TV series, a Star Wars spinoff featuring the character popularly known as Baby Yoda. On Thursday, Disney said it planned two further spinoff series, \u201cThe Rangers of the New Republic\u201d and \u201cAhsoka.\u201d  Including upgraded expectations for Hulu and ESPN+, Disney said it could reach 300 million to 350 million streaming subscribers worldwide.  Those numbers would challenge Netflix, which pioneered streaming in 2007 and had 195 million paying subscribers at the end of October.  Shares of Netflix slipped 0.6% during Disney\u2019s presentation.  Hollywood is closely following Disney\u2019s plans a week after AT&T Inc\u2019s Warner Bros upended the film business by saying it would debut all 17 of its 2021 movies on its HBO Max streaming service on the same day they hit theaters..  That left cinema chains including AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc, Cineworld Group and Cinemark Holdings Inc disgruntled about losing the window when they can screen movies exclusively in theaters before productions hit streaming services.  Disney said on Thursday two films - \u201cPinocchio\u201d and \u201cPeter Pan & Wendy\u201d - would skip theaters and go straight to Disney+, but it did not announce sweeping changes to its movie release strategy as Warner Bros. did.

Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts only plans to proceed with the bid if a federal judge allows AT&T Inc\u2019s planned $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc to proceed, the sources said. The U.S. Department of Justice has opposed the AT&T-Time Warner deal over antitrust concerns, and a decision from U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon is expected in June.  Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger clinched an all-stock deal with Fox Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch in December to acquire Fox\u2019s film, television and international businesses, giving the world\u2019s largest entertainment company an arsenal of shows and movies to combat growing digital rivals Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc.  Comcast, owner of NBC and Universal Pictures, has also made a 22 billion pound ($30 billion) offer to acquire the 61 percent stake in European pay-TV group Sky Plc that Fox does not already own. In doing so, it topped an earlier offer for the entirety of Sky by Fox.  Last November, Comcast offered to acquire most of Fox\u2019s assets in an all-stock deal valued at $34.41 per share, or $64 billion, a regulatory filing showed last month. Like Disney, Comcast sought to buy Fox\u2019s entertainment networks, movie studios, television production and international assets, the filing shows.  Fox ended up announcing an all-stock deal with Disney for $29.54 per share. In the regulatory filing, Disney and Fox cited regulatory hurdles as reasons to reject Comcast\u2019s bid, even though they did not reference it by name.  The exact value of Comcast\u2019s new bid for the Fox assets is not yet clear, although the $60 billion in new financing indicates it is seeking significant firepower to outbid Disney. Comcast already has a $30 billion bridge loan to finance its Sky offer.  The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Comcast, Fox and Disney declined to comment.  Fox shares rose 5.13 percent to $39.99 on the news in after-hours trading in New York on Monday. Comcast shares were down 1.5 percent to $31.90, while Disney shares were down 0.5 percent to $102.00.  Murdoch, who owns close to a 17 percent stake in Fox and holds about 40 percent of the voting power, prefers to be paid in stock rather than cash for the Fox assets, because this makes the transaction non-taxable for shareholders, sources have said. It is not clear how receptive he would be to an all-cash offer.  Last month\u2019s regulatory filing also showed that Fox viewed Disney\u2019s stock as more valuable than Comcast\u2019s, based on historic prices, and felt that a deal between Disney and Fox would generate greater long-term value. The Roberts family controls Comcast through a dual-class stock structure.  Comcast\u2019s stock has dropped since then, from around $38 to about $32 now, giving the company a market capitalization of $149 billion.  Disney has committed to share buybacks as a way of returning cash to Fox shareholders. As a result, Comcast sees an opening in being disruptive to the deal by making an all-cash bid, according to the sources.

Disney's Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger attends the opening event of Disney-Pixar Toy Story Land, the seventh themed land in Shanghai Disneyland in Shanghai, China April 26, 2018. REUTERS\/Aly Song - RC17C2D1E370  The world\u2019s biggest sovereign wealth fund, built on Norway\u2019s oil revenues, has become a more active shareholder in recent years and since 2017 has called for changes including the scrapping of long-term incentive plans and simpler and more transparent packages.  So far in this year's annual general meeting season, data shows the fund voted against a stock option plan for Tesla TSLA.O CEO Elon Musk, which would potentially be worth $2.6 billion to the electric carmaker's founder..  It has also voted against the pay of Disney DIS.N CEO Bob Iger, Christian Dior DIOR.PA CEO Sydney Toledano, Peugeot PEUP.PA CEO Carlos Tavares, Vinci SGEF.PA CEO Xavier Huilliard and Vivendi VIV.PA CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine.  The fund\u2019s chief executive Yngve Slyngstad said that transparency remains a sticking point on pay.  \u201cIt is the transparency and that is quite often linked to the simplicity,\u201d Slyngstad told Reuters on the sidelines of an earnings presentation on Friday.  \u201cIf you get to a situation where we have a possibility to voice our opinion on pay, it has to be reasonably well defined in advance -- what kind of pay package it will lead to.\u201d  The main way to influence was to determine the pay of incoming CEOs, rather than existing ones since their compensation has already been agreed, he said, adding that change could take five to 10 years.  He declined to speak about individual companies except for engineering firm The Weir Group WEIR.L, which the fund praised this month for being willing to \"challenge conventional thinking on remuneration\" by being simple and transparent.  \u201cThe Weir Group has led by example to a different degree than others and were very clear in the way they were doing it. We wanted to highlight them,\u201d said Slyngstad.  \u201cWe have not outlined any other companies that we would want to do the same for in advance. We are watching.\u201d  The fund is also against CEOs doubling up as chairmen and has voted against the elections of Bank of America BAC.N CEO Brian Moynihan, L'Oreal OREP.PA CEO Jean-Paul Agon and Walt Disney DIS.N CEO Bob Iger on their respective boards.  It is also against board members being elected as a group as it cannot then have a say on individual members. This season it therefore voted against the reelections of the boards of both Sweden's Alfa Laval ALFA.ST and Atlas Copco ATCOa.ST.  NEGATIVE RETURN  The fund posted its first loss in two years in the first quarter, primarily due to falling stock markets, and Slyngstad told an earnings presentation that rising protectionism could impact the fund\u2019s equity investments as the top 100 world multinationals account for 20 percent of its equity portfolio.  \u201cAny changes to the global supply chain, or tariffs that will hit the global supply chain, will of course be quite important for this fund ... Any action that reduces world growth will usually affect earnings and will affect pricing of the companies we are invested in,\u201d Slyngstad told reporters.  Some 66.2 percent of the fund\u2019s assets were held in stocks at the end of the first quarter, 31.2 percent in fixed income and 2.6 percent in real estate.  The fund\u2019s return was minus 1.5 percent in the quarter, slightly better than its own benchmark but lagging the positive return of 3.5 percent in the last quarter of 2017.  The most negative contributions were Nestle NESN.S, Facebook FB.O and Wells Fargo WFC.N. Nestle was the fund's third-largest equity holding at the end of the quarter, worth 46 billion crowns, fund data showed.  Investments in Amazon AMZN.O, Microsoft MSFT.O and Netflix NFLX.O made the most positive contribution.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The price set by the Takeover Panel on Friday is the same as Fox\u2019s current offer for the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own, which values the London-listed pay television business as a whole at 24.5 billion pounds ($32.2 billion).  But it is below U.S. giant Comcast's CMCSA.O competing 14.75 pounds per share offer for Sky, which has put a 25.9 billion price tag on the business.  The Panel\u2019s ruling is important for investors as it sets a new, higher floor price under Sky shares.  Sky, Fox, Disney and Comcast are locked in a series of interlinked takeover battles, with Fox and Comcast vying for control of Sky and Comcast and Disney battling to buy the bulk of Fox\u2019s TV and film assets, including its 39 percent Sky stake.  The Panel had previously ruled that Disney must make an offer for the rest of Sky if it succeeds in acquiring Fox, including its Sky stake, before either Fox or Comcast have taken full control of the broadcaster.  But the level at which Disney would be required to acquire the rest of Sky has recently been up in the air.  The Panel said in April Disney should match Fox\u2019s first offer for Sky, which was 10.75 pounds a share.  However, Disney last month raised its bid for the Fox assets, including the Sky stake, to $71.3 billion. To ensure all Sky shareholders are treated equally, the Panel hiked the level at which Disney would have to make a mandatory offer for Sky.  The regulator said it had considered \u201cthe relative contribution of Fox\u2019s stake in Sky in the valuation work carried out by Disney\u2019s financial advisers\u201d as well\u2019s Fox\u2019s most recent bid for the broadcaster when arriving at the 14 pounds a share price.  The Panel added it had \u201creceived submissions from a number of parties expressing diverging views\u201d and that Sky planned to request a review of its decision.  It comes as the battle between Fox and Comcast for Sky intensifies.  On Wednesday, Fox hiked its bid to 14 pounds a share, trumping a 12.50 pound offer Comcast made earlier this year.  But Comcast struck back later on Wednesday with its 14.75 pound counterbid, which Sky\u2019s independent directors recommended to shareholders.  Sky shares were at 15.39 pounds in London on Friday, down 0.4 percent.  The stock is trading above Comcast\u2019s bid amid investor anticipation that Fox will return with a better offer.","376":"April 19 (Reuters) - Dolby Laboratories Inc:  * DOLBY AND DISNEY ANNOUNCE EXTENDED THEATRICAL COLLABORATION  * DOLBY LABORATORIES INC - ANNOUNCED 20 DOLBY VISION AND DOLBY ATMOS TITLES FROM WALT DISNEY STUDIOS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","377":"May 8 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co reported a 9.1 percent rise in quarterly revenue on Tuesday, powered by the box-office success of superhero movie \u201cBlack Panther\u201d as well as higher attendance and spending in its theme parks and resorts business.

Fedida allegedly said of Roberts, who is black, that it was not as if the company was asking her to \u201cpick cotton.\u201d  Sources told HuffPost that as a result of Fedida\u2019s alleged misconduct, ABC News has spent millions of dollars in confidential settlements with former talent and staff, including at least one settlement related to allegations of racial discrimination.  \u201cThroughout my career, I have been a champion for increased diversity in network news,\u201d Fedida said in a statement. \u201cI am proud of my decades of work of hiring, supporting and promoting talented journalists of color. And, unlike these heartbreaking and incredibly misleading claims about me, that track record is well-documented and undeniable.\u201d  In a Monday email to staff, Disney executive Peter Rice, who oversees ABC News, said \u201cYou can be assured that once this investigation is concluded, we will take whatever actions are necessary.\u201d  ABC News said in a statement: \u201cThere are deeply disturbing allegations in this story that we need to investigate, and we have placed Barbara Fedida on administrative leave while we conduct a thorough and complete investigation.

Doubts about trade progress resurfaced earlier in the day when President Donald Trump, in remarks to reporters at the White House, said he has not agreed to a rollback of U.S. tariffs sought by China.  On Thursday, officials from both countries said that the United States and China had agreed to such a deal.  Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York, said that while the market was initially volatile because of Trump\u2019s remarks, it climbed right back.  \u201cThe feeling now is that before the end of the year we\u2019re going to see some type of deal,\u201d Ghriskey said, even if it is a partial one.

For the week, the S&P 500 rose 0.8%, posting a fifth straight week of gains, while the Nasdaq gained 1.1%, closing out its sixth straight week of gains. The Dow was up 1.2% for the week.  Increasing optimism on the trade front and mostly better-than-expected earnings have driven the recent record run in stocks. Of the 446 S&P 500 companies that have reported results so far, roughly three-quarters have beaten profit estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The numbers, to some extent, reflect significantly lowered analysts\u2019 forecasts.  Technology shares also supported the market, including Microsoft MSFT.O, which rose 1.2%.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  The club filed suit in a California court this week, claiming Disney violated the terms of a five-year agreement signed in 2017 that set out lucrative broadcast rights for their home games, plus other promotional services.  They argue the violations could leave the club without a viable broadcast partner to televise their games.  Santos Laguna assert the original deal they signed with what was then known as FSLA Holdings, formerly a unit of Fox, was worth some $106 million, covering broadcast rights of games both in Mexico and internationally beginning in the 2019\/2020 season.  But after Disney\u2019s $71 billion acquisition of Fox, Disney agreed to divest itself from FSLA, now known as TFCF Holdings.  The lawsuit alleges that in a related deal with Mexican regulators, Disney agreed that sports broadcaster ESPN, which is majority owned by Disney, would not try to buy up its competitor to ease regulatory approval for the acquisition in Mexico.  In Mexico, ESPN and Fox Sports channels are the two major broadcasters for professional soccer games.  \u201cWe believe the claims are utterly without merit and will defend against them vigorously,\u201d a Disney spokesman said.  With the future of TFCF in limbo, Santos say they will likely be denied license fees and other promotional considerations that they believe they are entitled to under the original contract.  That required FSLA to pay Santos at least $72.5 million for the right to broadcast home games, plus a marketing and promotion plan worth $33 million, the lawsuit said.  Santos Laguna are based in the northern city of Torreon.","398":"ANAHEIM, Calif., June 26 (Reuters) - Workers at California\u2019s Disneyland Resort protested from their cars on Saturday, arguing that the Walt Disney Co has not agreed to adequate protections for employees when the destination reopens to the public amid a pandemic.

Disney said this week that it would set a new opening date after the state issues guidelines on how theme parks can return to business safely amid the global coronavirus outbreak. That is not expected until after July 4, the company said.  On Saturday, about 200 cars formed a caravan outside the resort in the protest staged by the Coalition of Resort Labor Unions, a group of 11 unions that represent 17,000 Disneyland workers.  The unions have called on the company to commit to providing onsite testing for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.  \u201cWhen Disney does reopen, we want it to be as safe as possible for cast members, for the guests, and for the families that cast members have to go back to,\u201d said Maria Hernandez, a union member who attended the rally.  Disney did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Saturday. In a letter to unions earlier this week, a Disney representative said existing COVID-19 testing was not recommended by U.S. health authorities for routine screening.  Instead, health officials recommend focusing on physical distancing, face coverings, hand washing and sanitization, the letter said.  The company has reached an agreement on coronavirus protections with other Disneyland unions that represent 11,000 workers. Those agreements include \u201cenhanced safety protocols that will allow us to responsibly reopen,\u201d the company said.  Disney began shutting its theme parks in January as the coronavirus spread. It has reopened parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong to a limited number of guests. The company plans to open Walt Disney World in Florida on July 11.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Fox FOXA.O agreed an offer to buy all of Sky SKYB.L 17 months ago but is still waiting regulatory approval, while Disney has agreed to buy Fox assets, including its stake in Sky, in a separate deal subject to its own regulatory clearance.  The ruling means that if Fox\u2019s bid to buy Sky is blocked by the government in June because of Murdoch\u2019s media influence, Disney will have to step in to make the same offer to shareholders if and when it becomes the owner of Fox\u2019s assets.  Disney had said it should not be required to make a bid for the whole of Sky in line with Fox\u2019s existing offer if it bought the Fox assets, but Britain\u2019s Takeover Panel ruled on Thursday that it must match Fox\u2019s 10.75 pounds-a-share price.  Analysts had said Disney wanted a special dispensation to give it more flexibility on whether or when it would bid for the rest of Sky if it only bought the 39 percent stake from Fox.  The Takeover Panel, however, said it considered that securing control of Sky might reasonably be considered to be a significant purpose of Disney\u2019s acquiring control of Fox, and it must make an offer within 28 days of buying the Fox assets.  FOX COMMITTED  The Panel\u2019s ruling will not stand if Fox has acquired 100 percent of Sky by the time Disney buys the Fox assets, or if Comcast Corp or any other third party has acquired a stake of more than 50 percent in Sky.  U.S. cable company Comcast CMCSA.O said on Feb. 27 that it was considering making an offer for Sky.

Slideshow ( 8 images )  Bob Weis, President of Walt Disney Imagineering, addressed the trade issue at the opening of Toy Story Land, a new extension modeled after the Disney-Pixar film series and the park\u2019s first major expansion since it opened in 2016.  Shanghai Disneyland is a joint venture with state-owned Shendi Group, which has a 57 percent stake. Shendi is a consortium controlled by Shanghai Media Group, hotelier Jin Jiang International, supermarket-to-department store operator Bailian Group and developer Lujiazui Development Group.  \u201cThe way to think about us in terms of projects like this is that we are a local company,\u201d Weis said, when asked whether the company\u2019s costs could be impacted if retaliatory tariffs threatened by Beijing against U.S. goods were put in place.  \u201cIn the case of this you can look at ... toys or airplanes, everything here, they are built and made in China. We are really local in where we source things,\u201d he told reporters.  Weis, who oversaw construction of the park, said he was not worried about attendance falling due to the trade tensions. He said the park would keep expanding and come up with new ideas to attract visitors.  \u201cExpansion is definitely in our planning,\u201d Weis said.  Disney has emphasized its Chinese links since the park opened. Shanghai Disneyland\u2019s attractions include a Chinese-style Wandering Moon tea house, a Chinese Zodiac-themed garden and a Tarzan musical featuring Chinese acrobats.  However, since early April companies in the United States and China have worried about a potential trade war between the two countries which could see tariffs slapped on their products and raise costs.  China-based U.S. executives have expressed concerns that American brands could see a backlash similar to that faced by South Korea last year after Seoul deployed a U.S.-made missile defense system despite Beijing\u2019s strong objections.

FILE PHOTO: Tennis - US Open - Mens Final - New York, U.S. - September 10, 2017 - Rupert Murdoch, Chairman of Fox News Channel stands before Rafael Nadal of Spain plays against Kevin Anderson of South Africa. REUTERS\/Mike Segar  The hedge fund, run by Sir Christopher Hohn, owns 7.4 percent of Fox shares and said he disagreed with Fox\u2019s view that Comcast\u2019s bid would come with higher regulatory risk. TCI is \u201cstrongly motivated\u201d to support whichever deal came at a higher price.  The letter highlights shareholder appetite for a continued bidding war between Disney and Comcast over Fox, whose stock traded 1.7 percent higher on Thursday at $49.62, more than $10 above Disney\u2019s revised, roughly $38 per share offer.  Disney, Fox and TCI declined to comment. Comcast could not be reached immediately for comment.  Hohn\u2019s $17.5 billion hedge fund has held stakes in German carmaker Porsche PSHG_p.DE, Airbus Group AIR.PA and aero engine maker Safran SAF.PA, and called for changes to boost their stock prices.  Hohn said a U.S. judge's recent approval of AT&T Inc's T.N agreement to acquire Time Warner Inc is \"unequivocally positive\" for similar deals, such as Comcast's bid for Fox.  He also said the U.S. Department of Justice settlement with Disney earlier this week, which cleared the way for that company\u2019s planned acquisition of Fox, further reduced the regulatory risk for a potential Comcast deal.  Hohn said the timetable for a Comcast deal would be roughly similar to a one with Disney, given the need for either transaction to obtain regulatory approvals internationally.  Disney agreed to buy Fox for $71 billion in stock on June 20, trumping a $65 billion cash bid from Comcast. Disney had originally agreed to buy Fox for around $52 billion late last year.  Fox delayed its planned shareholder meeting, scheduled for next month, to give Comcast time to come back with a higher bid.  The Fox assets in play include a cable group that includes FX Networks, National Geographic and 300-plus international channels plus Fox\u2019s stake in Hulu.  Disney owns ABC, ESPN, Pixar, Marvel Studios and \u201cStar Wars\u201d producer Lucasfilm, plus an array of theme parks.  A deal for Fox would allow Comcast to better adapt to new trends in the pay-TV industry, as consumers abandon traditional cable bundles in favor of web-based offerings such as Netflix Inc NFLX.O.  The Financial Times first reported on the letter.","411":"LOS ANGELES, March 18, (Variety.com) - Disney-Marvel\u2019s \u201cBlack Panther\u201d has maintained its momentum at the domestic box office, winning its fifth consecutive weekend with $27 million from 3,834 locations.

Producer Katterli Frauenfelder, actor Colin Farrell, actor Nico Parker, director Tim Burton, actor Finley Hobbins, actor Eva Green, actor Danny DeVito, producers Derek Frey and Justin Springer attend the European premiere of \"Dumbo\" movie in London, Britain March 21, 2019. REUTERS\/Henry Nicholls  While that was easily enough to top the domestic box office, it marks the lowest start among the studio\u2019s recent live-action remakes of Disney classics. To compare, 2017\u2019s \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d debuted with $174 million, 2016\u2019s \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d opened with $103 million,\u201d and 2015\u2019s \u201cCinderella\u201d launched with $67 million.  Heading into the weekend, \u201cDumbo\u201d was expected to surpass $50 million in its first three days of release. Part of the reason for the softer opening is likely because the original \u201cDumbo\u201d cartoon came out 80 years ago, making the lovable elephant seem slightly less relevant than classics like \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d and \u201cThe Jungle Book,\u201d which both became huge successes for the studio.  \u201cDumbo\u201d carries a $170 million production budget. The high-flying elephant will have to resonate overseas should \u201cDumbo\u201d not pick up steam at the domestic box office. The movie launched in most international territories this weekend, amassing $71 million from foreign markets for a global start of $116 million.  Audiences were more receptive than critics to Tim Burton\u2019s take on baby elephant with inconveniently large ears. Moviegoers awarded \u201cDumbo\u201d with an A- Cinemascore. It holds a 50 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. As expected, families made up 54 percent of opening weekend crowds. It also skewed slightly female: 53 percent of patrons were women.  \u201cDumbo\u201d is the first of three high-profile Disney re-imaginings heading back to the big screen this year, with Guy Richie\u2019s \u201cAladdin\u201d and Jon Favreau\u2019s \u201cThe Lion King\u201d arriving in theaters this summer. Those films, along with the studio\u2019s highly anticipated superhero mashup \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d will likely offset any pain should \u201cDumbo\u201d fail to connect with audiences.  Last weekend\u2019s champ \u201cUs\u201d dropped to second place, staying strong with $33 million in its sophomore outing. That marks a 53% decline from its opening weekend haul, a solid hold given the kind of drop horror movies typically suffer after its initial release. Written and directed by Jordan Peele, \u201cUs\u201d has now surpassed $128 million in ticket sales in North America. The film, which stars Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Winston Duke as a couple forced to fight off blood-thirsty doppelgangers, cost $20 million to produce.  In third place, Disney\u2019s \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d added another $20 million in its third weekend of release. That takes the superhero tentpole starring Brie Larson past $350 million in North America.  New release \u201cUnplanned\u201d will battle with romance drama \u201cFive Feet Apart\u201d for fourth place. Both titles earned roughly $6 million this weekend.  \u201cUnplanned,\u201d which tells the true story of a Planned Parenthood employee who has a life-changing experience, doubled expectations that pegged an opening weekend around $3 million. It cost $6 million to produce.  Lionsgate and CBS Films\u2019 \u201cFive Feet Apart,\u201d now in its third weekend of release, has earned $35 million to date.  Elsewhere, Matthew McConaughey suffered the worst opening of his career with \u201cThe Beach Bum.\u201d Directed by Harmony Korine, the film flopped with $1.8 million from 1,100 screens. The studios initially planned for a platform release, which could have slowly allowed the film to gain traction through word-of-mouth.

Lifted by a blitz of original programs and 125 million global subscribers, some of whom have given up cable television packages, Netflix\u2019s stock has surged 80 percent so far in 2018, more than any other company in the S&P 500.  Since Netflix's initial public offer in 2002, when it was a mail-order DVD service, its shares have surged nearly 33,000 percent. It has also become a must-own stock for Wall Street investors, alongside Apple AAPL.O, Amazon.com AMZN.O, Alphabet GOOGL.O and Facebook FB.O.  Graphic: Wall Street's Binge, click reut.rs\/2LopvrD  Netflix\u2019s stock on Thursday was up 2.3 percent at $352.90, in line with the median price target of analysts covering the Los Gatos, California company, according to Thomson Reuters data. The most optimistic analyst price target would put Netflix\u2019s stock market value at $182 billion.  Disney has lost 5 percent over the past year as it and other one-time entertainment industry leaders struggle to adapt to the shift by global viewers to online video. It owns some of the most valuable entertainment brands in the world, including Marvel, Pixar Animation and \"Star Wars.\" It also operates popular theme parks on three continents and has offered to buy more assets from Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA.O for $52 billion.  With a stock market value of $152 billion on Thursday, Disney is also starting its own streaming service for families, and it has said it will stop supplying new movies to Netflix starting next year.  Earlier this month, Netflix's market capitalization overtook leading U.S. cable operator Comcast CMCSA.O, which owns NBC and Universal Pictures.  Comcast, with a stock market value of $145 billion, confirmed on Wednesday it was preparing a rival bid for Twenty-First Century Fox\u2019s media assets, setting up a bidding war with Disney.  Telecommunications company AT&T T.N and CNN parent Time Warner TWX.N, which are trying to win approval to merge, have a combined market capitalization of $274 billion.  Investors are bullish on Netflix\u2019s ability to add more members around the world, and they are paying red-hot prices to own its stock. Netflix recently traded at 98 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, versus Disney and Comcast at 14 times earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data.","425":"WASHINGTON, June 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is set to grant antitrust approval for Walt Disney Co to acquire most of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc\u2019s assets as early as Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter said.  Earlier this month, Comcast Corp offered $65 billion to lure Fox away from the Disney deal, setting up a bidding war between two of the largest U.S. media companies with its 20 percent higher offer. The Fox-Disney deal still needs numerous other regulatory approvals from other countries.

Walt Disney Co\u2019s shares jumped 9.5%, among the biggest boosts to the S&P 500 and Dow, as revenue declines for its parks and media networks were not as bad as feared.  Payments processor Square Inc surged 8.7% after reporting a 64% rise in second-quarter revenue, as consumers increased online buying and used its peer-to-peer Cash App platform during the pandemic.  \u201cThe analysts were too pessimistic for the second quarter, and corporate America and consumers refused to stand down,\u201d said Gerald Sparrow, chief investment officer of the Sparrow Growth Fund in St. Louis, Missouri.  Better-than-feared corporate results and a surge in shares of heavyweight technology companies have fueled a stimulus-driven rally in Wall Street\u2019s main indexes, bringing the S&P 500 within 2% of its record high hit in February.  Meanwhile, U.S. services industry activity gained momentum in July, according to an ISM survey, as new orders jumped to a record high. However, hiring declined, supporting views that a recovery in the labor market was faltering.  Earlier in the day, a loose precursor to the monthly jobs report on Friday showed U.S. private employers hired far fewer workers than expected last month.  \u201cThe (ADP) number confirms what the Fed is saying, that there\u2019s going to be fits and starts with this economy,\u201d said Sparrow.  Concerns about signs the U.S. economic activity is stalling amid a surge in cases of the novel coronavirus in parts of the country has strengthened the case for more fiscal aid.  Congressional Democrats and White House officials were set to resume negotiations on coronavirus relief legislation on Wednesday, with administration officials aiming for an agreement by Friday.  Financials, industrials and materials , that track economic growth, outperformed among the major S&P sectors. The energy index strengthened as oil prices jumped nearly 3%.

Fox News, the network owned by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox Corp, and whose commentators often promote Trump\u2019s agenda, stood alone for three hours with its projection that Biden would win Arizona. As of Wednesday, the winner of the presidency remained undecided while vote counts continued.  Fox News was also more than five hours ahead of CNN on projecting Biden would take Virginia, and hours in front on other states. It beat the Associated Press by 90 minutes on saying Trump would win the battleground state of Florida. None of those calls have been disputed.  \u201cWhether they were premature or right on time, the fact of the matter is that they were calling the races in the way races should be called, instead of through the lens that Trump would prefer,\u201d said Frank Sesno, a former CNN correspondent and director of strategic initiatives at George Washington University\u2019s School of Media and Public Affairs. \u201cThat\u2019s their job.\u201d  Their approach angered some Trump backers. Jason Miller, a Trump campaign senior adviser, and Arizona Governor Doug Ducey were among those saying Fox News acted too quickly. Fox News correspondent John Roberts said on air that the Trump campaign was \u201clivid.\u201d  As the night unfolded, Fox News\u2019 average audience topped rivals in prime time and into the early morning hours of Wednesday, according to Nielsen data. From 6 p.m. to 3 a.m. EST, Fox News averaged 10.9 million viewers, compared with 7.0 million for CNN. Fox News\u2019 Arizona call came shortly before 11:30 p.m. EST.  Fox News already had irritated Trump and some supporters in recent months.  \u201cThe people who are watching @FoxNews, in record numbers (thank you President Trump), are angry. They want an alternative now. So do I!,\u201d Trump tweeted in August.  Overall election night viewership slumped below 2016 when Trump upset Democrat Hillary Clinton. Nielsen figures showed that roughly 56.9 million people watched this year\u2019s prime-time coverage across 21 networks.  In 2016, 71.4 million people watched across 13 networks.  The TV ratings do not include viewership via online platforms, which have jumped in popularity.","431":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - During commercial breaks in a broadcast of World Wrestling Entertainment's WWE SmackDown, fans were shown ads for Walt Disney Co's DIS.N new streaming service, Disney+.

Disney\u2019s marketing force is reaching beyond its traditional family audience to send a message that its $7-a-month subscription service Disney+ offers something for all ages. The service debuted on Tuesday in the United States, Canada and The Netherlands.  \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent upon us to market it the right way to emphasize the fact that it\u2019s not just for kids,\u201d Disney executive Kevin Mayer said during a briefing at the company\u2019s Burbank, California, headquarters. \u201cIt\u2019s all family friendly, but everyone can enjoy this product.\u201d  Disney has told investors it can hook 60 million to 90 million customers within about five years as it competes for customers in a crowded streaming market dominated by Netflix Inc NFLX.O.  Signing up adults who do not have children at home is part of that plan.  Consumers may not realize that after a series of acquisitions Disney is much more than classics like \u201cCinderella\u201d and \u201cMary Poppins\u201d that charmed generations of families. The company now owns the celebrated \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie franchise; Iron Man, the Hulk and dozens of other Marvel superheroes; \u201cToy Story\u201d animation house Pixar, and nature programming channel National Geographic.  Previously released movies and TV series from all of those brands, plus 30 seasons of \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d are available on Disney+ alongside decades of Disney\u2019s family-centric offerings.  Disney+ also offers new programming from those brands.  To raise awareness, the company is promoting Disney+ during sports and primetime TV telecasts to get in front of what Hollywood calls the four quadrants of viewers: male, female, young and old.  \u201cWe\u2019re unmatched in quality and appeal across our four-quadrant audience spanning a variety of genres, formats and arenas, and will continue to build on that year after year,\u201d said Ricky Strauss, president of content and marketing for Disney+.  In addition to the wrestling, football and gaming contests, ads ran during the World Series and the ABC News late-night program \u201cNightline,\u201d and on social media networks.  Early testing in The Netherlands, where Disney offered a free two-month trial of Disney+, attracted a \u201cvery large and diverse audience,\u201d said Mayer, who runs Disney\u2019s direct-to-consumer and international unit.  \u201cMarvel\u2019s Agents of SHIELD,\u201d a series aimed at 18- to 49-year olds, ranked as the most-watched piece of content, Mayer said. Next was tween-oriented show \u201cThe Suite Life of Zack & Cody\u201d followed by \u201cDisney\u2019s Mickey Mouse Clubhouse,\u201d a cartoon for young children.  \u201cOur hypothesis was we will have a lot of different types of viewership, that it\u2019s not going to be centered among any one of our brands,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a nice confirmation of what we want accomplished.\u201d  The initial response in The Netherlands has cheered industry analysts.  \u201cThey have some surprising and encouraging signs about this potential that Disney+ is not just kids and family,\u201d Forrester analyst Jim Nail said.  But unlike Netflix, Disney+ limits how far its programming will go to attract older viewers. To keep it family friendly, the service will not have any R-rated movies or TV shows designated TV-MA for mature audiences.  Programming considered too adult for Disney+ may stream on Hulu, which Disney also owns. That will include FX series such as \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d and \u201cFargo\u201d and possibly movies starring Deadpool, a Marvel character known for foul-mouthed humor, when rights become available.  \u201cThere are boundaries to what we\u2019ll put on Disney+,\u201d Mayer said. \u201c\u2018Deadpool\u2019 is definitely not for Disney+.\u201d","432":"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia has added more technology companies that will be obligated to apply 10% value-added tax on sales to Indonesian customers to include Facebook, Disney and TikTok, its tax office said on Friday.

The additional companies announced on Friday include three units of Facebook, Tiktok Pte Ltd, Apple Distribution International Ltd, The Walt Disney Company (Southeast Asia) Pte Ltd, and more of Amazon\u2019s subsidiaries, including its audiobook unit Audible and its voice assistant Alexa.  Facebook said the company would comply.  \u201cIn Indonesia, we will start collecting VAT as of September 1, 2020, as required under Indonesia regulations,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman said.  The other companies did not immediately respond to requests to comment.  Under the rules, non-resident foreign firms which sell digital products and services in Indonesia worth at least 600 million rupiah ($41,040) a year, or which generate yearly traffic from at least 12,000 users, must pay the 10% VAT.  Tech giants are increasingly facing tougher fiscal regimes in Southeast Asia, including in Thailand and the Philippines, where legislation pending house approval proposes VAT of 7% and 12% respectively.  The Indonesian tax office in a statement said it continues to identify other technology companies to inform them of the digital tax rules, adding the number of firms subject to the VAT would likely increase.  The VAT rules aim to create a level playing field between foreign and local companies and between conventional and digital businesses, it said.  Indonesia expects a 13% annual drop in state revenue this year as the coronavirus disrupts business activity.","433":"FILE PHOTO: The NBC and Comcast logos are displayed on 30 Rockefeller Plaza in midtown Manhattan in New York, U.S., February 27, 2018.

A spokesman for Disney confirmed that the latest figures include the 28,000 layoffs announced earlier.  Earlier this month, Disney said it was furloughing additional workers from its theme park in Southern California due to uncertainty over when the state would allow parks to reopen.  Disney\u2019s theme parks in Florida and those outside the United States reopened earlier this year without seeing new major coronavirus outbreaks but with strict social distancing, testing and mask use.  Disneyland Paris was forced to close again late last month when France imposed a new lockdown to fight a second wave of the coronavirus cases.
