REUTERS\/Toru Hanai\/File Photo  Fidelity funds that are top Tesla holders, including Blue Chip Growth Fund,FBGKX.O Growth Company Fund FDGRX.O and Contrafund FCNTX.O, all voted as Tesla recommended at two shareholder meetings held in March and June, the filings showed.  At both Tesla meetings top proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services recommended critical votes, citing concerns about Musk\u2019s pay and board independence, among other things. Fidelity\u2019s votes marked the second set of supportive ballots disclosed by a top investor in the carmaker so far this year.  A Fidelity spokeswoman said the Boston-based firm would not comment on what the votes might suggest about the go-private deal Musk is seeking. How much backing funds offer will determine how much money Musk will need to raise in his unprecedented bid to take the company private.  Asked about the votes, Tesla spokesman Dave Arnold noted comments Musk made in a blog post that he would sound out some top investors about going private and that \u201cOur largest investors have been extremely supportive of Tesla over the years.\u201d  The positive votes by the Fidelity funds on the controversial election items could suggest their managers will be more likely to support Musk going forward, said Francis Byrd, a corporate governance consultant.  \u201cYou could presume they are sort of locked in,\u201d Byrd said, though he cautioned that the funds would ultimately want to see the financials of any deal Musk puts forward.  A July 24 filing by Scotland\u2019s Baillie Gifford, Tesla\u2019s largest owner after Musk himself, also showed it backing Tesla across the board at both meetings. A Baillie Gifford representative declined to comment.  The special meeting in March was held to approve a new compensation package potentially worth $2.6 billion for Musk. A filing showed the plan won support from about 81 percent of votes cast.  Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services had recommended voting against the award as too rich. ISS also recommended votes against two of three Tesla directors who stood for election at its regular meeting in June, citing concerns about their independence and seats on other boards.  ISS also recommended investors back shareholder proposals including one that would require an independent chairman. The directors each won at least 89 percent support, a filing showed, and the proposal for an independent chair was backed by only about 16 percent of votes present.  Thursday\u2019s filings offered a rare look at thousands of influential votes Fidelity cast at shareholder meetings this year.  Also noteworthy was that Contrafund, a top shareholder in Facebook Inc FB.O, backed one of two proposals at its May 31 meeting calling for the world's largest social media company to revamp its voting structure.  While neither measure passed, strong support they received from outside investors was seen as a rebuke to leaders, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, over their slow response to data privacy concerns.  The filing also showed Contrafund supported all eight Facebook directors up for election including Zuckerberg.  Spokespeople for Fidelity and Facebook did not immediately comment.","1":"(Corrects fourth paragraph to show Musk was agreeing with a comment from another person on Twitter, not making the comment himself)  Aug 7 (Reuters) - Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Twitter he is considering taking Tesla Inc private at $420 per share as the electric car maker faces the challenges of fast growth and financial constraints, sending its shares up more than 6 percent.  At $420 per share, a deal would represent a 22.8 percent premium to Tesla\u2019s closing price on Monday, making it one of the biggest go-private deals with a price tag of about $72 billion.  \"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured,\" Musk said on Twitter. bit.ly\/2Om3gn3  When another person tweeted that going private \u201csaves a lot of headaches,\u201d Musk replied, \u201cYes\u201d.  Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for clarification.  Tesla\u2019s shares jumped to $362.74 in afternoon trading. The company had a market value of $58 billion as of Monday\u2019s close. Musk owns nearly 20 percent of the company.  Earlier in the day, the Financial Times reported that Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, overseen by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has built an undisclosed stake of between 3 and 5 percent stake in Tesla.  Musk has been under intense pressure this year to prove he can deliver on his promise to turn his money-losing company into a profitable higher-volume manufacturer, a goal that has propped up Tesla shares and resulted in a market value higher than that of General Motors Co.  \u201cI believe Tesla considers Tweets as public disclosure. I think he\u2019s serious. Plus this is short squeeze rocket fuel after a nice quarter,\u201d said analyst Chaim Siegel from Elazar Advisors.  A short squeeze is a trading scenario that occurs from time to time in heavily shorted stocks, when bearish traders are forced to buy shares to avoid big losses - something that ends up pushing the stock only higher.  Short interest in Tesla on Monday stood at nearly $12 billion, equivalent to 28 percent of its float, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission allows companies to use social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter to announce key information in compliance with its fair disclosure rules so long as investors have been alerted about which social media outlets will be used to disseminate such information.  The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Musk\u2019s tweet.  George Galliers of Evercore ISI said he believed the tweet was serious.  \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is something to bluff or make fun of. Given his historic frustration with short sellers, analysts and certain parts of the press, it is perhaps also not surprising that he has given consideration to taking the company private,\u201d Galliers said.  \u201cDetails, structure, participants and how the valuation has been determined remain to be seen.\u201d (Reporting by Sonam Rai in Bengaluru, Alexandria Sage in San Francisco and Pete Schroeder in Washington; editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)","2":"DUBAI\/RIYADH\/LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) has shown no interest so far in financing Tesla Inc TSLA.O CEO Elon Musk's proposed $72 billion deal to take the U.S. electric car maker private, despite acquiring a minority stake in the company this year, two sources familiar with the matter said.  FILE PHOTO: A Tesla sales and service center is shown in Costa Mesa, California, U.S. June 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  The 47-year-old investor and engineer stunned financial markets on Tuesday when he said on Twitter that he was considering a take-private deal for Tesla, an auto manufacturing pioneer that developed the world\u2019s first luxury all-electric sedan car. He also said he had secured funding for the proposal, without providing details.  Investors and analysts viewed PIF as a natural financing partner. Beyond amassing a stake of just below 5 percent in Tesla, the sovereign wealth fund has poured tens of billions of dollars into technology investments, including $45 billion in SoftBank Group Corp's 9984.T Vision Fund over five years.  However, a source who is familiar with PIF\u2019s strategy said it was not currently getting involved in any funding process for Tesla\u2019s take-private deal.  A second source close to the situation also said PIF was not taking part in any such plan at this stage. This source said that the Saudi fund would not make an investment of this kind without seeking guidance first from Softbank. According to separate sources who spoke to Reuters last week, Softbank is currently not pursuing an investment in Tesla given its investment earlier this year in rival GM Cruise.  Pressure is mounting on Musk to produce details of his financing plan.  Bloomberg reported on Sunday that PIF is in talks that could see it become a significant investor in Tesla as part of the take-private plan but has made no firm decision, citing people with knowledge of the fund\u2019s plans.  Tesla\u2019s board has not received a detailed financing plan from Musk and is seeking more information, sources told Reuters on Thursday.  The board will make a decision on whether to hire advisers and launch a formal review of Musk\u2019s take-private proposal in the coming days, based on how much detail on the financing plan it receives from Musk, another source said.  The sources requested anonymity because the deliberations are confidential. A spokesman for PIF was not immediately available for comment. A Tesla spokesman declined to comment on behalf of the company and Musk.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has contacted Tesla to ask about Musk\u2019s assertion on Twitter that funding for his proposed deal was \u201csecured\u201d, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.  Tesla is facing a make-or-break moment in its eight-year history as a public company, as competition from European automakers is poised to intensify with new electric vehicles from Mercedes, Audi, BMW and other rivals.  Taking Tesla private would remove the pressure from Musk coming from hedge funds betting that the company\u2019s stock will drop given its production issues and negative cash flow. It would also remove the company from the glare of Wall Street that comes with reporting quarterly earnings publicly.  In a letter to employees on Tuesday, Musk suggested a choice for shareholders of selling their shares for $420 each or remaining investors in a private Tesla.  Musk has also said he would be looking to keep his ownership of Tesla at around 20 percent in a buyout deal, and that a special purpose vehicle, like the one that exists at his aerospace company SpaceX, would allow Tesla shareholders to remain invested if they so choose.  Investment bankers and analysts have so far reacted with scepticism, telling Reuters it would be hard for Musk, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $22 billion, to raise the equity and debt financing needed for the deal given Tesla is not turning a profit.  Some analysts have suggested that Musk could convince Tesla\u2019s top shareholders, such as Fidelity Investments and China\u2019s Tencent, to roll their equity stakes into the deal, thereby significantly reducing the amount of money needed to be raised.  However, the deal structure would come with big logistical and legal challenges when it comes to buying out smaller shareholders, analysts have said.","3":"FILE PHOTO: The company logo is seen in front of a showroom of U.S. car manufacturer Tesla in Zurich, Switzerland March 28, 2018.

FILE PHOTO: Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk dances onstage during a delivery event for Tesla China-made Model 3 cars in Shanghai, China January 7, 2020. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  Tesla's ascent took many investors by surprise. But executives at Daimler AG DAIGn.DE, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz, had a close-up view starting in 2009 of how Tesla and its chief executive Elon Musk were taking a new approach to building vehicles that challenged the established system.  Daimler, which bears the name of the man who invented the modern car 134 years ago, bought a nearly 10% Tesla stake in May 2009 in a deal which provided a $50 million lifeline for the struggling start-up.  That investment gave Mercedes engineers an inside view of how Musk was willing to launch technology that wasn\u2019t perfect, and then repeatedly upgrade it, using smartphone style over-the-air updates, paying little regard to early profitability.  Mercedes engineers helped Tesla develop its Model S luxury sedan in exchange for access to Tesla\u2019s partially hand-assembled battery packs, but in 2014 Daimler decided to sell their stake amid doubts Tesla\u2019s approach could be industrialized at scale.  Tesla would go on to pioneer new approaches in manufacturing, designs in software and electronic architecture which enable it to introduce innovations faster than rivals, leaving analysts to draw comparisons with Apple AAPL.O.  Three people directly involved with the Mercedes side of the collaboration said the brief partnership highlighted the collision of old and new engineering cultures: the German obsession with long-term safety and control, which rewarded evolution, and the Silicon Valley carmaker\u2019s experimental approach which embraced radical thinking and fast innovation.  \u201cElon Musk has been walking on the edge of a razorblade in terms of the aggression with which he pushes some technologies,\u201d said a former Mercedes engineer who worked on the partnership.  By contrast, Mercedes and other established automakers are still not comfortable about releasing a new technology, such as partially automated driving, without years of testing.  Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.  Investors favor the Tesla model, in an industry undergoing fundamental and dizzying change even though the U.S. carmaker will face an onslaught of competing electric vehicles from established automakers during the next few years.  They are putting their money on Musk and his company, even though Mercedes-Benz alone sold 935,089 cars in the first half of 2020, dwarfing the 179,050 delivered by Tesla in the same period.  Today, Tesla is worth nearly $304.6 billion, more than six times Daimler\u2019s 41.5-billion-euro ($47.7 billion) market capitalization.  TWO CULTURES COLLIDE  Daimler and Tesla began collaborating after Mercedes engineers, who were developing a second-generation electric Smart car, bought a Tesla Roadster. They were impressed by the way Tesla packaged batteries, so arranged a visit to Silicon Valley to meet Musk in January 2009 and ordered 1,000 battery packs.  The collaboration expanded. At a joint press conference in the Mercedes-Benz museum in Stuttgart in May 2009, Tesla said the partnership would \u201caccelerate bringing our Tesla Model S to production and ensure that it is a superlative vehicle\u201d.  For its part, Mercedes wanted to use Tesla\u2019s batteries to power an electric version of its compact Mercedes-Benz B-Class. The Tesla Model S would hit the road in 2012. An electric B-Class, arrived in showrooms two years later.  Despite having batteries supplied by Tesla, the Mercedes had a shorter operating range after Daimler engineers configured the B-class more conservatively to address their concerns about long-term battery degradation and the risk of overheating, a second Daimler staffer who worked on the joint projects told Reuters.  German engineers found that Tesla engineers had not done long-term stress tests on its battery. \u201cWe had to devise our own programme of stress tests,\u201d the second Daimler engineer said.  Before starting production of a new car, Daimler engineers specify a \u201cLastenheft\u201d - a blueprint laying out the properties of each component for suppliers. Significant changes cannot be made once the design is frozen.  \u201cThis is also the way you can guarantee that we will be profitable during mass production. Tesla was not as concerned about this aspect,\u201d the second Daimler source said.  Daimler\u2019s engineers suggested the underbody of the Model S needed reinforcing to prevent debris from the road puncturing a battery pack, the first Daimler engineer said.  To quash doubts about safety and security, following a series of battery fires, Tesla raised the ride height of its vehicles, using an over-the-air update, and a few months later, in March 2014, said it would add a triple underbody shield to new Model S cars and offered to retrofit existing cars.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Musk was able to make adjustments quickly thanks to Tesla\u2019s ability to burn through more cash during development.  \u201cAt Mercedes you can make such adjustments every three years at best,\u201d the engineer said.  The Model S, a four-door electric sedan would go on to outsell the flagship Mercedes-Benz S-Class in the United States in May 2013, and outstrip S-Class deliveries globally by 2017.  MUSK: INNOVATE OR GO  Musk's relentless focus on innovation explains, in part, why he has disrupted the traditional auto world. In an interview here at the 2020 Air Warfare Symposium, published on YouTube, he was asked about the importance of innovation among his employees.  \u201cWe certainly need those that do advanced engineering to be innovative,\u201d Musk said. \u201cThe incentive structure is set up ... such that innovation is rewarded. Making mistakes along the way does not come with a big penalty. But failure to try to innovate at all ... comes with a big penalty. You will be fired.\u201d  Established automakers are playing catch-up to Tesla, designing their own software operating systems and dedicated electric cars.  Mercedes will release its EQS next year - a four-door limousine built on a dedicated electric vehicle platform, with an operating range of 700 km. A new version of the Mercedes S-Class, which will have combustion and hybrid powertrains and semi-autonomous driver assistance systems, is due this year.  From an investor perspective, traditional players face billions of dollars in restructuring costs as they transform product lines and factories to move away from internal combustion technology  \u201cNo one is going to give an OEM (established automaker) a five-year window to say ... you can totally retool your business, and I am going to buy in and fund this journey,\u201d said Mark Wakefield, co-leader of automotive and industrials practice at consulting firm AlixPartners.  Start-ups, however, get time from investors to learn, make mistakes and grow, he added.  Investors are betting on Tesla's ability to scale up manufacturing just as they once backed Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, which defined the auto industry's last era with its mastery of highly efficient, high-quality lean production.  Toyota overtook the market capitalization of former industry leader General Motors GM.N in 1996, though it wasn't until 2008 that it sold more vehicles than its Detroit rival.  The Japanese giant also cultivated ties with Tesla, with the U.S. startup helping it design an electrified RAV4 compact sports utility vehicle under a 2010 deal.  Toyota was impressed by the speed with which Tesla came up with the new design, but ultimately decided Tesla\u2019s methods were not suitable for mass production by a mainstream manufacturer when Toyota\u2019s standards for product quality and durability were applied, two company insiders familiar with the partnership said.  Toyota said the joint project involved cooperation on the development of electric cars, parts and production system.  \u201cToyota accomplished what the project set out to achieve, and it ended in October 2014 after Tesla delivered roughly 2,500 electric powertrain systems over three years\u201d for an electrified RAV4 crossover SUVs, a spokeswoman said.  Both the Toyota and Daimler collaborations were agreed before the Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE emissions-cheating scandal in 2015, which prompted a global regulatory backlash and forced carmakers to step up investments in electric cars.  \u201cThat was all before dieselgate, which changed the economics of electric and combustion-engined cars,\u201d a senior Daimler manager said. \u201cTesla has a lead. Let\u2019s see if they can scale up.\u201d","7":"FILE PHOTO: Volkswagen logo is seen at the LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, U.S., November 20, 2019.

Tesla Inc pulled workers from other departments to keep pumping out the Model 3 electric sedans, disrupting production of the Model S and X lines. And weekend shifts were mandatory.  Tesla pulled out all the stops in the final week of June to meet its goal of making 5,000 Model 3s in a week, according to employees who spoke to Reuters.  Whether Tesla can do it week in and week out - and without relying on overtime and extra hands - is another question, and one that weighed on investors Monday, as shares slumped 2.3 percent.  Leading up to Sunday morning\u2019s production milestone, Musk paced the Model 3 line, snapping at his engineers when the around-the-clock production slowed or stopped due to problems with robots, one worker said. Tesla built a new line in just two weeks in a huge tent outside the main factory, an unprecedented move in an industry that takes years to plan out its assembly lines, and said the tented production area accounted for 20 percent of the Model 3s produced last week.  \u201cThey were borrowing people from our line all day to cover their (Model 3) breaks so the line would continue to move,\u201d said a Model S worker on Sunday.  Because of the focus on the Model 3, the S line is about 800 cars behind, the worker said.  \u201cThey\u2019ve been throwing Model 3s ahead of the S to get painted to try to assure that they make their goal of 5,000,\u201d the worker said. \u201cThe paint department can\u2019t handle the volume.\u201d  Disruption of the Model S and X lines could threaten Tesla\u2019s target of building 100,000 of those vehicles in 2018. Tesla built 49,489 of those cars in the first half of this year.  Asked about the potential S and X impact, Tesla said it also produced 1,913 of those vehicles during the last week of the quarter along with its Model 3s.  Tesla said it built a total of 28,578 Model 3s in the second quarter, and 40,989 since production began last July.  Last week\u2019s big push also brought a rewrite of the employee attendance policy. After mandatory weekend shifts were assigned, two workers said, Tesla rescinded a policy promising workers at least one week\u2019s notice before weekend work.  \u201cThe manager and supervisor are verbally going around and saying: \u2018If you don\u2019t come in, you\u2019ll be written up\u2019,\u201d one of the workers told Reuters last week.  Some employees are worried the frenetic pace plus long hours could burn out workers. One employee said they were told to keep working until they met their daily production mark, not when their shifts ended.  \u201cThey said starting tomorrow be prepared to work up to 12 hours,\u201d said the Model S employee on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be basically 12 hours from now on and I\u2019ve got a feeling it\u2019s gonna be six days a week.\u201d  To make its number, Tesla was willing to \u201cspend any kind of money,\u201d a Gigafactory worker said, pointing to the new battery assembly-line flown in from Europe via cargo planes to the Gigafactory in May.  In the morning of Sunday, July 1, about five hours after the self-imposed second-quarter deadline had passed, the number 5,000 flashed on a countdown screen viewed by Tesla\u2019s Model 3 assembly-line workers. The Model 3 itself bore a \u201c5,000\u201d sign in its front window.

The decision comes as Tesla is under pressure to turn a profit and days after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk stepped down as chairman to settle allegations by regulators that he misled investors.  Tesla has been plagued with safety complaints brought by workers, allegations that Tesla denies. Workers say that long hours and pressure to deliver vehicles quickly takes a toll, and some have pushed for a union.  Tesla said it investigated the allegations and broke ties with a subcontractor, ISM Vuzem, that it said did not live up to its expectations. \u201cWe\u2019ve also since improved our supplier contracts and policies to better stop bad behavior,\u201d it said in a statement.  According to the lawsuit, Gregor Lesnik of Slovenia came to the United States on a B-1 visa and worked 250 hours per month for less than $950, well below minimum wage. It also alleges that foreign workers were threatened with deportation or reduced pay if they reported injuries or became ill.  The 2016 lawsuit by Lesnik and Stjepan Papes of Croatia seeks class action status on behalf of foreigners with B-1 visas working at construction sites at U.S. auto plants.  Tesla was one of several automakers named as defendants, but the only one that was not dismissed from the case because plaintiffs only alleged to have suffered threats of deportation at Tesla\u2019s plant in Fremont, California.  Koh denied a motion to dismiss for two Tesla subcontractors, Eisenmann Corp and ISM Vuzem because they operated at the same plant.  Eisenmann and Vuzem did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Koh said her ruling was based on a \u201cgenerous reading of the at times incomprehensible\u201d lawsuit, but also said the allegations against Tesla and Eisenmann were \u201cuncharacteristically specific.\u201d  Koh rejected arguments that Tesla and Eisenmann were not liable because the alleged abuses were committed by Vuzem.

Tobias Schwarz\/Pool via REUTERS  (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Wednesday the company will produce Model Y with a new structural battery design and technology at its Berlin factory next year and that could result in a \"significant production risk\".  The U.S. electric carmaker plans to manufacture a new version of its Model Y crossover vehicle, and possibly even battery cells at the site. Last month, Musk said that Tesla will use its Germany-based plant to demonstrate a radical overhaul of how its cars are built.  The company plans to start the production of Model Y at Gigafactory Berlin during the second half of 2021.  Tesla\u2019s new battery cell - a larger cylindrical format called 4680 that can store more energy and is easier to make - is key to achieving the goal of cutting battery costs in half and ramping up battery production nearly 100-fold by 2030.  The company\u2019s new structural battery pack requires the new 4680 battery cells in order to work.  Musk said on Wednesday that it will take about two years for Tesla factories in Fremont and Shanghai to embrace the new technology.  \"Fremont and Shanghai will transition in 2 years when new tech is proven,\" Musk said in a tweet bit.ly\/2I8Gam3.  The company said last week that it delivered 139,300 vehicles in the third quarter, a quarterly record for the electric carmaker.

FILE PHOTO: The company logo of Tesla cars is seen on the V3 supercharger equipment during the presentation of the new charge system in the EUREF campus in Berlin, Germany September 10, 2020. REUTERS\/Michele Tantussi\/File Photo  Tesla shares slumped 7.5% in early Wednesday trading, wiping out more than $30 billion in market value from Tuesday\u2019s close. Analysts and investors divided over whether Musk can deliver on his visions of novel, proprietary Tesla batteries that could make electric cars competitive with mass market, petroleum-fueled cars.  Some analysts praised Tesla\u2019s impressive technology, capacity and cost targets. But others said Musk\u2019s promises lacked substance and questioned the three-year timeline he outlined for delivering the promised breakthroughs. Musk acknowledged that some of Tesla\u2019s ambitious technology is proving \u201cinsanely difficult\u201d to manufacture at high volume.  Investors had expected two big announcements from Musk: the development of a \u201cmillion mile\u201d battery good for 10 years or more, and a specific cost-reduction target - expressed in dollars per kilowatt-hour - that would finally drop the price of an electric vehicle below that of a gasoline car.  They got neither from the event, with Musk promising a $25,000 car three years down the line that would \u201cbasically be on par\u201d with a gasoline car. Musk has promised such a car for years.  Analysts from Swiss banking group UBS said that promise came with risks.  \u201cBy the time (the car) arrives, there will be significant competition in the segment, from VW group, amongst others,\u201d the bank\u2019s analysts wrote in a note to clients.  Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE on Wednesday unveiled its latest electric vehicle, the ID.4 sport utility and said it would be priced to sell in the United States for thousands less than a Tesla Model Y SUV.  Tesla has yet to deliver a previously promised $35,000 Model 3 sedan. The lowest-range version of that car currently retails for nearly $38,000 in the United States, with narrow profit margins generally making inexpensive cars unattractive to automakers.  Analysts also criticized that it would take at least another year to see some of Tesla\u2019s battery innovations in production. Musk said the company was starting to ramp up the production of larger, more energy-dense cells at a California pilot facility, but acknowledged the process was not yet fully working.  At $305, the average target price among the 33 brokerages who follow the company is another $100 lower and several brokerages emphasized that expectations for what the company could deliver were already out of whack with reality as the global economy heads into a potentially long-lasting recession.  Morgan Stanley said Musk had shown substantial progress, but also laid bare the scale of the task in front of the company.  \u201cElon can\u2019t do it alone ... Tesla needs help to get there,\u201d its analysts wrote, saying governments, suppliers, investors and engineering talent would have to support the company\u2019s mission.  Jed Dorsheimer, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said Tesla\u2019s challenges to scale batteries and manufacturing capacity at affordable rates showed Tesla was a modern day auto, rather than a tech company with high valuations.  Tesla\u2019s Battery Day did yield some positive reviews, however.  Analysts at Deutsche Bank said the three-year plan for achieving 56% reduction in battery costs could materially boost Tesla\u2019s volume and margin outlook. The brokerage moved from the sidelines to assign a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on the stock, and raised its price target to $500 from $400.","18":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O is recalling 15,000 Model X SUVs because of a potential issue that can lead to a loss of power steering assist that could make steering harder and increase the risk of a crash.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Transport Canada said aluminum bolts that attach the electric power steering gear assist motor to the gear housing may corrode and break causing a reduction or complete loss of power steering assist.  The recall applies to 2016 model year X vehicles. Tesla said the vehicles being recalled include most Model X vehicles built before mid-October 2016, but the move does not affect vehicles built after that date.Tesla issued a similar recall in March 2018 for 123,000 Model S vehicles worldwide built before April 2016 that called for replacing steering assist motor bolts.  NHTSA said there are no known crashes or injuries associated with the Model X recall. The recall covers 14,193 U.S. vehicles and 843 in Canada. Tesla will arrange for the replacement of the mounting bolts and will also replace the steering gear if needed, Transport Canada said.  Tesla said it has \u201cobserved excessive corrosion on the bolts that attach this component to the steering gear in affected Model X vehicles\u201d and primarily in areas with very cold climates that use road salts. Tesla said if the bolts fail it would require \u201cmore force to turn the steering wheel, especially during low speed parking maneuvers.\u201d  Tesla said it was not aware of any injuries or collisions relating to the power steering component.  Tesla added drivers can continue to operate their Model X SUVs before the issue is addressed. Tesla said it will contact owners to schedule appointments when parts are available.  Tesla said it will also apply a corrosion-preventative sealer in all affected Model X vehicles to account for the possibility that vehicles may later be used in cold climates.  Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.","19":"BERLIN (Reuters) - Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Wednesday that there had been no discussion yet of German government subsidies for U.S. electric vehicle pioneer Tesla TSLA.O, which has said it will build its first European factory near Berlin.  \u201cSubsidies have not yet been discussed.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  On Jan. 18, Musk announced thousands of job cuts and said the electric car maker was targeting a \u201ctiny profit\u201d in the first quarter \u201cwith great difficulty, effort and some luck.\u201d He also forecast a profit for the fourth quarter, albeit down from the third quarter\u2019s $311.5 million.  The analyst consensus on Jan. 21 turned to a loss for the first quarter and stands at $2.5 million. Analysts on average were expecting Tesla to post a profit of $62.80 million on a reported basis as of Jan. 17, according to Refinitiv data.  \u201cOne potential rationale for the company guiding to a loss in March is the timing of vehicles in transit to Europe and Asia,\u201d said Gene Munster from Loup Ventures in a note on Jan. 24.  The company has said it would begin delivering Model 3s to Europe and China in February.  Musk\u2019s dependency on \u201cluck\u201d to be barely profitable while selling its long-range Model 3 to Europe and China and the mid-range Model 3 in the U.S. calls into question the company\u2019s ability to make profits when it finally starts selling its long-promised $35,000 vehicle, analysts said.  Since unveiling the Model 3 three years earlier, Tesla has faced hurdles ranging from production hassles to logistics problems along with a cash crunch and self-inflicted wounds by Musk\u2019s erratic behavior.  While the production of Model 3s are going steady at over 5,000 per week, analysts expect Tesla to face tougher competition from lower priced offerings from Jaguar and Audi, and a reduction of electric car tax credits.  After the federal tax cut came into effect from Jan. 1, Tesla was forced to lower the price of Model 3s by as much as $2,000. That decision is likely to eat into Tesla\u2019s thin profit margins in the first quarter.  At least six brokerages have cut their price targets and two have downgraded the stock to \u201csell\u201d\u2019 or equivalent this month, after Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter Model 3 deliveries fell short of expectations.  Shares of Tesla have fallen nearly 14 percent since the job cuts announcement on Jan. 18. They were down 3.1 percent at $287.85 on Monday.  The company is set to report its fourth quarter results on Jan. 30.","21":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O outpaced analyst estimates for second-quarter vehicle deliveries on Thursday, defying a trend of plummeting sales in the wider auto industry as coronavirus-linked lockdown orders kept shoppers at home, and sending its shares up 8%.

Tesla delivered 90,650 vehicles during the quarter, significantly above estimates for 74,130 vehicles, according to Refinitiv data. It delivered 80,050 units of its new Model Y sport utility vehicle and Model 3 for the quarter.  The company did not break out deliveries by model or country, but Chinese vehicle registrations showed accelerating consumer demand for the Model 3 sedan. Nearly 16,200 Teslas were registered in China in April and May combined, with June figures still outstanding.  The company is also ramping up output at its Shanghai vehicle factory, where it aims to produce 150,000 vehicles by the end of this year. The Shanghai plant was only briefly impacted by coronavirus shutdowns in late January and early February.  Tesla\u2019s only U.S. vehicle factory -- in California, where the bulk of its vehicles is currently produced -- was shut down for some six weeks during the quarter, heeding local orders to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Tesla in January said 2020 vehicle deliveries should comfortably exceed 500,000 units, a forecast the company has left unchanged despite the pandemic.  Tesla is now seeking a location for a second U.S. vehicle factory to build its Model Y and a new electric pickup truck, zeroing in on Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Austin, Texas.  Other major automakers posted lower U.S. monthly or quarterly new vehicle sales on Wednesday due in large part to weak fleet orders, but said consumer demand remained robust despite the continuing coronavirus pandemic.","22":"June 11 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc has got \u201ca decent shot at a record quarter on every level\u201d, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday.

REUTERS\/Joe Skipper  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk has set up a new diversion for the electric-car maker he runs. On Tuesday he announced on Twitter he is \u201cconsidering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\u201d That\u2019s not as big a long shot as it might sound. But a buyout would have to be short on leverage.  Musk\u2019s putative offer values Tesla at some $72 billion. Although U.S. regulators have softened their stance on leveraged lending recently, banks would probably lend only around a third of that to keep debt within six times EBITDA. Be generous and apply that to Morgan Stanley\u2019s estimate of almost $6 billion of EBITDA in 2022. After stripping out Tesla\u2019s current debt, that leaves around $25 billion to purchase shares.  That may look like Musk would be $50 billion adrift of his goal. But he\u2019s not selling his own 20 percent stake. And he still commands a lot of faith among his shareholders. Before his latest tweets, the stock was trading around 40 times estimated earnings for 2020, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S. That suggests plenty of smaller investors would probably go along for the ride and take up Musk\u2019s offer to keep their stakes if Tesla goes private.  For the same reason, he should be able to persuade many of the top 20 owners to stay in the passenger seat. They own more than 50 percent of the stock. Even if a good number chose to exit the vehicle, there are plenty of other investors to chase after. The Saudi Public Investment Fund, for example, has built a $2 billion stake this year, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday. SoftBank has already injected money into Uber and General Motors \u2013 and its Vision Fund has amassed an almost $100 billion war chest.  The visionary founder has appeared irritated by his lost status as the irreproachable wonder boy of Silicon Valley. Recent criticism about missed production targets and capital needs has gotten under his skin; in May he derided analysts for asking \u201cboring, bonehead questions.\u201d Tesla is also the most shorted stock on U.S. bourses.  Driving the company off the public market would remove many of these irritants. Granted, it wouldn\u2019t solve the \u201cproduction hell\u201d Tesla has been in for over a year.

The electric car maker has just $543 million of the $1.8 billion credit facility left to use, according to a regulatory filing on Monday. But banks periodically review the amount they are willing to lend, and Tesla continues to burn through cash.  \u201cWhile not clear at this point, we suspect that with the large upcoming cash burn in 2Q18, the banks have demanded additional collateral protection for Tesla to maintain its $1.8 billion facility,\u201d CreditSights analysts said in a note.  \u201cIn doing so the banks are protecting themselves.\u201d  A person familiar with the matter told IFR the amendment had not been requested by the banks and was at the company\u2019s discretion.  But the 5.3 million square-foot plant in Fremont, California would give banks a claim on one of Tesla\u2019s most valuable assets. It is the production hub of Tesla\u2019s mass-market Model 3 sedan, which is seen as key for the company\u2019s path to profitability.  Tesla, however, is struggling to ramp up production of the car. It is trying to build 5,000 of the vehicles per week by the end of June and overcome manufacturing hurdles that have delayed its rollout.  \u201cThey are still going to burn cash for a couple of years,\u201d said Scott Roberts, head of high yield investments at Invesco, who does not own Tesla bonds.  \u201cThey are shoring up liquidity before they need to probably because they think they will need it.\u201d  CROWN JEWELS  Chief Executive Elon Musk has promised investors that the company will swing to a profit in the third quarter, after accumulating losses for several quarters.  He has also said the company does not need new funding, but many analysts and investors believe Tesla will need to raise more capital by the end of this year.  CreditSights said the company has some options. Its current capital structure includes convertible bonds, one junk bond and the bank credit facility.  But it could also add a secured revolver and a term loan with the right mix of assets provided as collateral to help fund its ongoing heavy capital needs and to fund near-term maturities including a convertible bond that matures next year.  Tesla previously pledged accounts receivables, inventory, and equipment as collateral for the credit facility, which was signed by a group of nine lenders led by Deutsche Bank.  It could offer up other valuable assets, such as its Gigafactory in Nevada or its intellectual property, to secure additional cash, CreditSights said.  Raising new debt could prove expensive as the company\u2019s only junk bond - a $1.8 billion unsecured issue sold last summer to help finance production of the Model 3 - has plummeted in price to trade at just 87 cents on the dollar for a yield of 7.7 percent.  And seeing a valuable asset like the Fremont factory encumbered so soon after that bond was sold may make investors even more cautious.  \u201cThe more assets that get encumbered, the more questions will be asked about why,\u201d said CreditSights.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Monday it was expanding a probe into nearly 159,000 Tesla Model S and Model X vehicles, upgrading it to an engineering analysis, a step required before it can seek to compel recalls.  The auto safety regulator had opened a preliminary evaluation in June over touchscreen failures. NHTSA said the failure can result in the loss of rear-camera image display when in reverse and reduced rear visibility when backing up, and can impact defogging ability, and audible chimes relating to driver assistance system Autopilot and turn signals.  Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The probe now covers 2012-2018 model year Tesla Model S and 2016-2018 Model X vehicles. The preliminary investigation covered 63,000 Tesla Model S cars.  NHTSA said the failure does not affect vehicle-control systems.  The media control unit (MCU) uses an Nvidia Corp Tegra 3 processor, NHTSA said.  The flash devices have a finite lifespan based on the number of programs or erase cycles, NHTSA said.  Some complaints said failures could result in loss of charging ability and that other safety alerts could be impacted. One driver said he could not clear fogged windows because he could not change climate controls.  In total, NHTSA said it has reviewed 12,523 claims and complaints about the issue, which would impact roughly 8% of the vehicles under investigation.  Tesla said it has received 2,399 complaints and field reports, 7,777 warranty claims, and 4,746 non-warranty claims related to MCU replacements.  Many complaints said Tesla requires owners to pay to replace the unit once warranties expire.  NHTSA said the data showed \u201cfailure rates over 30% in certain build months and accelerating failure trends after 3 to 4 years-in-service.\u201d  Tesla has implemented over-the-air updates \u201cto mitigate the effects of MCU failure,\u201d NHTSA said, including changes to reduce memory usage of the subject memory card, improving storage management strategies, and changing the control logic for turn signal activation.","31":"FILE PHOTO: A Tesla sales and service center is shown in Costa Mesa, California, U.S., June 28, 2018.

That came just five days after Musk settled SEC fraud charges, in an accord that lets him remain Tesla\u2019s chief executive but requires he step aside as chairman. A judge has yet to approve the settlement.  Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Its shares were down 7 percent at $262.05 in late afternoon trading.  Greenlight is having a difficult year, with its main fund down 25.7 percent through September, but said its Tesla short position was its second biggest winner in the third quarter.  In an investor presentation in May 2008, four months before Lehman went bankrupt, Einhorn had questioned the investment bank\u2019s accounting, including for real estate, and said it needed to raise large amounts of capital.  Einhorn said Tesla has \u201cmany parallels\u201d to Lehman, which he said \u201cthreatened short sellers, refused to raise capital (it even bought back stock), and management publicly suggested it would go private.\u201d  \u201cMonths later, shareholders, creditors, employees and the global economy paid a big price when management\u2019s reckless behavior led to bankruptcy,\u201d Einhorn said.  He said a big problem for Musk is that Tesla would lose too much money targeting a mass audience by selling its Model 3 at a $35,000 starting price, and yet \u201ccan\u2019t bring himself\u201d to cancel the program and refund customer deposits.  \u201cHis conduct suggests that he is doing his best to be relieved of his position as CEO to avoid accountability,\u201d Einhorn said.  Musk, for his part, has used Twitter to mock Einhorn, saying on Aug. 1 he would \u201csend Einhorn a box of short shorts to comfort him through this difficult time.\u201d  Greenlight said it also sold its last Apple Inc AAPL.O shares in August at $228 per share, eight years after buying the iPhone maker at less than one-sixth that price, on growing fear of \"Chinese retaliation against America's trade policies.

In an email he said had been sent to staff, billionaire Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Tuesday that the cuts were part of a simplification of Tesla\u2019s management structure promised last month.  \u201cAs part of this effort, and the need to reduce costs and become profitable, we have made the difficult decision to let go of approximately 9 percent of our colleagues across the company,\u201d the email read.  \u201cThese cuts were almost entirely made from our salaried population and no production associates were included, so this will not affect our ability to reach Model 3 production targets in the coming months.\u201d  Tesla has been trying to hit a 5,000 per week production target of its Model 3 sedans after facing initial production hiccups. Last week, Musk said the carmaker should achieve its target by the end of June.  Shares rose as much as 7 percent and were last up 3.6 percent at $344.18.  The layoffs mean there likely will not be more job cuts in the near-term, said Efraim Levy, analyst at CFRA Research, adding that Tesla will likely raise capital early in 2019.  \u201cI don\u2019t think if Tesla becomes profitable in Q3 and Q4, that will be sustainable because of ramping up of the production. The layoffs may help them to achieve profitability in the near-term but not sustain it.\u201d  Tesla has been burning through cash as it continues to spend on its assembly line and prepares for new investments on projects such as the Model Y crossover and its Gigafactory.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Free cash flow, a key metric of financial health, widened to negative $1 billion in the first quarter from negative $277 million in the fourth quarter, excluding costs of systems for its solar business.  Several Wall Street analysts anticipate a capital raise this year despite Musk\u2019s statements that it will not be necessary due to profitability and positive cash flow in the third or fourth quarters.  Tesla said it began notifying impacted workers on Tuesday and would continue to do so throughout the week. A spokesman said it would reduce overall employment back to around 37,000 - roughly in line with numbers at the end of last year.  Musk also said that Tesla had decided not to renew a residential sales agreement with Home Depot HD.N, and would focus instead on selling its solar products through its own stores and website. The company will seek to re-employ most Tesla employees at Home Depot stores at its own locations.  Musk told employees in May that the company was undergoing a \u201cthorough reorganization\u201d as it contends with production problems, senior staff departures and recent crashes involving its electric cars.  At the start of April, the company\u2019s shares had fallen by around 35 percent from a peak hit last September but signs that it is on course to meet an output target of Model 3 cars have wiped out almost all of this year\u2019s losses.","35":"(Reuters) - Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk appeared to qualify on Monday for a $700 million payday, just three days after he said the electric car company\u2019s stock price was too high.  Shares of Tesla Inc TSLA.O jumped more than 8% on Monday, putting Tesla's market capitalization at $141.1 billion at the close. More importantly for Musk, Tesla's stock market value reached a six-month average of $100.2 billion, according to an analysis of Refinitiv data.  Hitting a six-month average of $100 billion triggers the vesting of the first of 12 tranches of options granted to the billionaire to buy Tesla stock as part of a pay package agreed in 2018. Musk has already met two other requirements by hitting a growth target and far exceeding a one-month average $100 billion market cap.  Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 1.69 million Tesla shares at $350.02 each. At Tesla\u2019s closing stock price of $761.19, Musk would theoretically be able to sell the shares for a profit of $694 million.  Musk on Friday said on Twitter, \u201cTesla stock price is too high imo,\u201d using an abbreviation for \u201cin my opinion\u201d.  That tweet sent Tesla\u2019s stock tumbling 10%, shocking shareholders. Tesla, whose California factory is closed as part of the state\u2019s coronavirus-related lockdowns, posted its third quarterly profit in a row last week.  Musk, who is also the majority owner and CEO of the SpaceX rocket maker, receives no salary or cash bonus, only options that vest based on Tesla\u2019s market cap and milestones for revenue and profit growth.  A full payoff of all tranches would surpass anything previously granted to U.S. executives.  When Tesla unveiled Musk\u2019s package in 2018, it said he could theoretically reap as much as $55.8 billion if no new shares were issued. However, Tesla has since issued shares to compensate employees, and last year it sold $2.7 billion in shares and convertible bonds.  Musk\u2019s subsequent options tranches would vest at $50 billion increments of Tesla market capitalization over the agreement\u2019s 10-year period, with the billionaire earning the full package if Tesla\u2019s market capitalization reaches $650 billion and the high tech vehicle maker achieves several revenue and profit targets.","36":"Sept 22 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk on Tuesday is scheduled to showcase the company\u2019s advanced battery technology, with investors expecting he will outline how the company\u2019s electric vehicles will surpass the cost and convenience of internal combustion engines.  As automakers shift from horsepower to kilowatts to comply with stricter environmental regulations, investors are looking for evidence that Tesla can increase its lead in electrification technology over legacy automakers who generate most of their sales and profits from gasoline-powered vehicles.  Musk, who frequently launches new products in attention-grabbing, show-like announcements, has fueled expectations for Battery Day over the past months, in April calling the event \u201cone of the most exciting days in Tesla\u2019s history.\u201d  On Monday, Musk said on Twitter that the battery improvements to be unveiled at the event would not reach \u201cserious high-volume production\u201d until 2022, sending Tesla shares down 5% in extended trade.  Analysts expect Tesla to present a range of updates, including significant improvements to the amount of energy its batteries can store, allowing vehicles to drive further on a single charge. They also await updates on the production cost of battery cells, largely seen as an impediment to wider electric vehicle adoption.  \u201cWe suspect there will be a plenty for everyone,\u201d Canaccord analyst Jed Dorsheimer said in a Monday note.  Investors, for example, expect Musk to explain how Tesla will capitalize on its 2019 acquisition of U.S. battery company Maxwell Technologies Inc. Some investors expect the automaker to announce that Maxwell\u2019s dry battery electrode technology could significantly reduce manufacturing costs, speed up production and improve batteries\u2019 energy storage capacity.  Musk has complained in the past that Tesla vehicles are not affordable enough. Tesla\u2019s lowest-range Model 3 sedan with a range of 250 miles (400 km) currently starts at $37,990 in the United States. Musk in July said scaling battery cell production at an affordable price was Tesla\u2019s biggest limitation to growth.  Tesla\u2019s futuristic Cybertruck, expected to be released in 2021, will have a maximum range of 500 miles, among the longest range of any electric vehicle on the market today.  While average electric vehicle prices have decreased in recent years thanks to changes in battery chemistry and composition, they are still more expensive than conventional cars, with the battery estimated to make up a quarter to a third of an electric vehicle\u2019s cost.  Some researchers estimate that price parity, or the point at which electric vehicles are equal in value to internal combustion cars, is reached when battery packs cost $100 per kilowatt hour (kWh).  Tesla\u2019s battery packs cost $156 per kWh in 2019, according to electric vehicle consulting firm Cairn Energy Research Advisors, which would put the cost of a 90-kWh pack at around $14,000.  Analysts at UBS expect Tesla to announce battery cell costs of $70 to $80 per kWh over the next three years, allowing the company to save roughly $2,300 per vehicle.  Such a price advantage would leave competitors unlikely to catch up to Tesla, the UBS analysts said.  Tesla currently produces batteries in partnership with Japan\u2019s Panasonic Corp at its $5 billion Nevada factory, while South Korea\u2019s LG Chem and China\u2019s CATL supply cells to its Shanghai factory.  Musk on Monday said Tesla intends to increase battery cell purchases from those three suppliers and possibly with other partners as well.  Tesla is also building its own cell manufacturing facility at its new factory in Germany and is setting up a battery research and manufacturing facility at its largest vehicle factory in Fremont, California.  Musk in July also said Tesla was open to license and supply powertrains and batteries to other automakers.","37":"(Corrects China sales to $669 million from $699 million in third paragraph)  Oct 29 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc\u2019s third-quarter revenue tumbled 39% in the United States, its first drop in more than two years, but sales in China and other regions surged, the electric car maker\u2019s break down of sales by geography showed on Tuesday.

Tesla has bounced back from a poor first quarter by posting record sales for the three months to the end of June. But the company\u2019s drive back to growth is only half the ride.  The $40 billion outfit revealed late Tuesday that it had handed customers the keys to some 95,000 vehicles last quarter. That\u2019s 51% more than in the previous three months, a dismal performance that led to a $700 million loss for the period. The improvement should be a relief for investors on two fronts. First, it ought to quell fears that demand for the mass-market Model 3 has dropped. Also, on this performance Tesla\u2019s cash burn ought to be much reduced. That explains why the stock jumped 7% in after-hours trading.  But the numbers don\u2019t restore Tesla\u2019s status as a fast-growth company. Overall production of around 87,000 cars was barely higher than the previous record set in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. There\u2019s also the chance that customers in the United States rushed to buy a Tesla before a federal tax credit halved to just under $2,000 at the end of June. A previous cut in the credit six months earlier contributed to the poor first-quarter showing.  The record-setting sales may not pull Tesla into the black in any case. Making money on the Model 3 was hard enough six months ago when the average price was just below $60,000. But Musk recently introduced cheaper variants, which will drag down margins. Moreover, the company delivered fewer than 18,000 of the high-margin S and X vehicles last quarter. While better than the previous three months, it leaves the first-half total at just 60% of the 2017-2018 run rate. It suggests that Tesla vehicles are susceptible to competition \u2013 Audi, Porsche and Jaguar all now have rival offerings on the roads.  Musk has been pushing Tesla to cut costs, but fixing poor-quality cars and shoddy after-sales service requires investment. And capital expenditure needs a boost, with barely a tenth of his 2019 target of $2.5 billion spent in the first quarter. Getting production and sales cranking again is encouraging, but turning a profit remains tough.","39":"Tesla superchargers are installed at the Quinte Mall in Belleville, Ontario, Canada, May 6, 2018.

A Tesla spokeswoman welcomed the decision.  \u201cTesla only sought fair treatment for our customers and we hope the Ministry now does the right thing by delivering on its promise to ensure all [electric vehicle]-owners receive their incentives,\u201d the spokeswoman said in an email on Tuesday.

Premier Doug Ford\u2019s government, which came to power the previous month, made provisions for people who had already bought or ordered cars but structured the transition program in such a way as to exclude Tesla, which does not use franchised dealerships.  In challenging the program, Tesla called this an \u201carbitrary\u201d exclusion.  Myers agreed, calling the exclusion \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201cegregious\u201d in his ruling, in part \u201cbecause the (Transportation) Minister singled out Tesla for reprobation and harm\u201d without providing the company a chance to be heard.","40":"(Reuters) -Silicon Valley billionaire Elon Musk said on Tuesday he had relocated to Texas from California as he wanted to focus more on Tesla Inc\u2019s new electric car plant and his SpaceX venture in the Lone Star state.

The electric car maker also affirmed its target to deliver half a million vehicles by the end of this year, a goal that will require it to significantly ramp up vehicle sales in the fourth quarter.  Shares were up 2.5% at $433.88 in extended trade as the carmaker beat analysts\u2019 estimates.  Tesla said it had the capacity installed to produce and deliver 500,000 vehicles this year, but added that achieving its goal has become more difficult.  \u201cAchieving this target depends primarily on quarter over quarter increases in Model Y and Shanghai production,\u201d the company said.  Asked by an analyst during a conference call whether Tesla aimed to deliver 840,000 to 1 million vehicles next year, based on its factories\u2019 current maximum capacity, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk responded the target was \u201cin that vicinity,\u201d while another Tesla executive said the company would provide guidance next quarter.  Tesla has defied a downward trend in the wider auto industry in 2020 and bucked a pandemic and economic upheaval with steady sales and profitable quarters, sending shares up around 400% this year.  At $394.5 billion, Tesla\u2019s market capitalization has become the largest among all global automakers, despite the company trailing rivals in sales, revenue and profit.  Tesla\u2019s ascent highlights investor confidence in the future of electric vehicles and the company\u2019s shift from niche carmaker to global leader in clean cars.  But Craig Irwin, an analyst with Roth Capital Partners, cautioned that Tesla\u2019s lead could soon narrow.  \u201cThe company is still valued incredibly richly, like it\u2019s operating in a vacuum, yet competitors are working furiously to catch up,\u201d he said, referring to more than 400 new electric vehicle models scheduled to hit the roads by 2024.

Musk on Wednesday said Cybertruck orders will be delivered in 2022, or toward the end of 2021 the earliest.  Tesla in September outlined plans to cut battery production costs by producing larger cells in-house to power a growing fleet, including heavier, more energy-intense vehicles.  But Musk on Wednesday said the company would not depend on internal cell production before 2022, suggesting that Tesla will continue to rely on its external battery suppliers Panasonic Corp, LG Chem and CATL.  He also said Tesla would roll out what it calls \u201cFull Self Driving\u201d more widely by the end of this year. Tesla on Wednesday launched the feature for an undisclosed number of \u201cexpert, careful\u201d drivers in a pilot launch.  Musk has been promising fully autonomous features for several years and Tesla buyers can pay $8,000 in hopes of eventually receiving the upgrade.  Safety groups have criticized the term \u201cFull Self Driving\u201d as dangerously misleading, with the system expected to be capable of functioning only in limited-use cases.  Revenue rose to a record $8.77 billion from $6.30 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $8.36 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Excluding items, Tesla posted a profit of 76 cents per share. It reported net income of $331 million, or $874 million excluding stock-based compensation awards given to Musk.  Revenue from the sale of regulatory credits made up $397 million. Without that revenue, Tesla would not have achieved a profitable quarter.  So far this year, regulatory credits account for $1.18 billion, or 7% of total automotive revenue.  Pollution credits became a more meaningful source of revenue for Tesla about a year ago when California and other U.S. states increased the mandatory share of zero-emission vehicles sold per manufacturer. As competitors begin selling more electric vehicles, that revenue is expected to dry up.  With recovery in the United States sluggish and Europe struggling with a second bout of the virus outbreak, some analysts have pinned their hopes for Tesla on growth on China, which has begun to recover as consumers shake off the pandemic\u2019s effects.  Tesla does not break out regional sales, but data from China\u2019s auto industry association, CPCA, showed Tesla Model 3 sedan sales remained roughly flat from July to September. Overall, Tesla sold around 34,100 Shanghai-made Model 3s in the third quarter.  Tesla on Wednesday said Model 3 production at its Shanghai plant has increased to 250,000 vehicles a year, its targeted production rate.  Its main factory in Fremont, California, has a capacity of 590,000 vehicles, including the Model Y.  The carmaker said it would focus on improving manufacturing cost and efficiency and increase capacity as quickly as possible.

That is more than the combined value of trades in Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc over the same period.  At about halfway through Wednesday\u2019s session, traders had exchanged $20 billion worth of Tesla shares, according to Refinitiv.  Up over 400% in 2020, Tesla has become by far the world\u2019s most valuable automaker, despite production that is a fraction of Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen or General Motors Co.  Over the past year, Tesla has averaged over $16 billion a day in trades, followed by Apple, at about $14 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  Trading in Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO Inc has also surged in recent weeks, with its shares nearly doubling in November.  Including NIO, trading of stocks in the nascent electric vehicle industry reached an average of $38 billion a day in the past five sessions, accounting for 12% of all trading on U.S. exchanges. By comparison, traders in the same period bought and sold each day about $8 billion worth of oil and gas stocks including Exxon Mobil and Chevron.","43":"FILE PHOTO: Futurist entrepreneur Elon Musk presents an RNA printer, essentially a vaccine production device, on the sidelines of a meeting with the leadership of the conservative CDU\/CSU parliamentary group in Berlin, Germany September 2, 2020.

Tesla has acknowledged as much in public filings that described the company as \u201chighly dependent on the services of Elon Musk.\u201d Musk himself called Tesla \u201cmy company\u201d in a 2016 conference call with analysts, and he\u2019s claimed publicly that if he had not taken on the CEO job, the company would not have survived. Tesla\u2019s board is stacked with Musk allies, including his brother and two close friends and investors whom Musk bestowed with prototype Tesla cars.  Given Musk\u2019s towering persona, it might surprise you to know that he actually owns only about 22 percent of Tesla\u2019s shares. So does Musk, as a legal matter, control Tesla?  That was the question before Vice-Chancellor Joseph Slights of Delaware Chancery Court in consolidated shareholder and derivative litigation over Tesla\u2019s $2 billion acquisition of SolarCity \u2013 another Musk company \u2013 in 2016. As you know, the standard of scrutiny is more exacting in deals involving companies controlled by majority shareholders than in companies with no controlling investor. Corporations without a majority shareholder are almost always entitled to business judgment deference, which is pretty much a death knell for shareholder suits. Even if investors can show the sale process was flawed, the Delaware Supreme Court said in 2016\u2019s Corwin v. KKR Financial Holdings, corporate boards are still shielded by the business judgment rule as long as the transaction was approved by a majority of shareholders.  Corwin comes with a catch, though: It applies just to companies without a controlling shareholder.  No problem, said lawyers for Tesla and its board members. Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz argued in a motion to dismiss the consolidated shareholder suit that Musk\u2019s 22 percent ownership of Tesla is too small to be considered a controlling stake. The Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s most aggressive precedent on control by a minority shareholder was 2003\u2019s In re Cysive, in which the court said a shareholder with a 40 percent stake wielded enough voting power to be considered a controlling shareholder, according to the Wachtell motion. Musk holds a considerably smaller stake in Tesla, the motion said, and independent institutional investors control their own big chunks of Tesla stock.  Tesla said Musk\u2019s dominant managerial style doesn\u2019t make him a majority owner. \u201cCEOs (especially good ones) often exercise significant day-to-day control over a company\u2019s operations; they often have significant stockholdings; and they are often the public face of their companies,\u201d the Tesla brief said. \u201cThat\u2019s their job. Such facts do not make them controlling stockholders under Delaware law.\u201d Tesla stock holders, Wachtell argued, voted in favor of SolarCity acquisition. (Musk and other Tesla shareholders with overlapping stakes in SolarCity did not vote.) Under Corwin, Wachtell said, the vote entitles the Tesla board to business judgment deference.  Shareholders, represented by lead counsel from Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, Grant & Eisenhofer and Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, said Tesla\u2019s argument defied the reality of Musk\u2019s power and influence at the company and underestimated the conflicts of Tesla board members who also held stakes in SolarCity, and thus stood to benefit when Tesla acquired the near-worthless company.  \u201cMusk \u2026 controls Tesla through a combination of his voting power as the company\u2019s largest stockholder and his managerial authority derived from his status as the company\u2019s visionary, inspirational force, CEO and chairman, and from his active and crucial role in the day-to-day operations and technical advancements of Tesla,\u201d shareholders argued in their brief opposing dismissal. \u201cMusk\u2019s power to control the Tesla Board was particularly potent in the (SolarCity) acquisition because at least a majority of its members shared a special interest in the acquisition with him or were under his influence.\u201d  Vice-Chancellor Slights sided with the shareholders, finding that Musk effectively controlled the board\u2019s decision to acquire SolarCity even though he owned only 22 percent of Tesla\u2019s shares. The judge said at the beginning of his opinion that the case was \u201ca close call,\u201d but the body of his decision offers an array of justifications for his holding.  Slights seemed particularly skeptical about the deal process, in which Musk asked the board three times to buy an ever-more precarious SolarCity. Tesla\u2019s other directors never formed an independent committee to evaluate the deal and never considered the purchase of a different solar power company instead of SolarCity, despite what the vice-chancellor called \u201cthe Tesla board members\u2019 obvious conflicts.\u201d The board\u2019s first meeting with Tesla\u2019s financial advisor on the SolarCity deal, Evercore, was the session in which it agreed to the acquisition. Musk and another conflicted Tesla director recused themselves from that meeting \u2013 but both actually were present for the board presentation on the SolarCity deal. Musk, according to Vice-Chancellor Slights, \u201cled most of those discussions.\u201d  Shareholders plausibly alleged that Tesla took \u201cpractically no steps \u2026 to separate Musk from the board\u2019s consideration of the acquisition,\u201d Slights wrote. \u201cWhen Musk rather insistently brought the proposed acquisition to the board for consideration, the board was well aware of Musk\u2019s singularly important role in sustaining Tesla in hard times and providing the vision for the company\u2019s success.\u201d  Numerically, Musk\u2019s 22 percent stake wasn\u2019t dispositive, the judge said, but the board surely knew of his \u201cwillingness to facilitate the ouster of senior management when displeased.\u201d And the Tesla bylaws, he said, impose supermajority voting requirements on a variety of important corporate decisions, giving Musk, as the largest shareholder, \u201csignificant control over corporate matters while only owning approximately 22% of Tesla\u2019s common stock.\u201d  The combination of Musk\u2019s voting influence, indispensability to Tesla and domination of the deal process added up to the same level of control a majority shareholder would hold, Vice-Chancellor Slights said. Therefore, he ruled, the Tesla shareholder vote doesn\u2019t entitle the board to business judgment review under Corwin. Shareholders can now move ahead with discovery on their breach-of-duty and other claims.  The Tesla ruling is a rare win for investors litigating in Delaware Chancery Court, and I suspect few acquisitions fit the fact pattern Vice-Chancellor Slights described in the Tesla opinion. But it\u2019s good to know that even in the Corwin era, shareholders can still have a shot at holding corporate directors accountable.  I emailed William Savitt of Wachtell, who argued for Tesla board members at the Dec. 17 hearing on the company\u2019s motion to dismiss, but didn\u2019t hear back.","60":"FILE PHOTO: Tesla China-made Model 3 vehicles are seen during a delivery event at its factory in Shanghai, China Jan. 7, 2020.

However, Unsworth has said he is considering legal action against the billionaire entrepreneur, who is chief executive of the electric car maker Tesla Inc TSLA.O.  \u201cI can\u2019t let it go. There\u2019s too much out there already,\u201d Unsworth told Reuters in an interview. Asked which law firm he would hire, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know yet. I have to take advice.\u201d  Unsworth declined to identify who had approached him.  Tesla spokespeople did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Musk could not be reached for comment.  Musk\u2019s spat with Unsworth started last week, after rescue teams rejected Musk\u2019s offer of a mini-submarine created by his rocket company SpaceX to help extract the youth soccer team and the coach from the labyrinth of partly flooded passages.  \u201cIt just has absolutely no chance of working,\u201d CNN quoted Unsworth as saying about the submarine.  Musk responded on Twitter on Sunday saying: \u201cWe will make one (video) of the mini-sub\/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problem. Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.\u201d  The Tweet was later deleted.  Unsworth said he hadn\u2019t flatly denied Musk\u2019s accusation because he was waiting for legal advice.  Asked why he thought Musk would make such a comment about him, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d  A police officer in the Chiang Rai, where Unsworth has lived for seven years, said that no charges or complaints had ever been filed against Unsworth. The officer declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media.  FAMILY UPSET  Unsworth, 63, said he hadn\u2019t actually met Musk face to face when Musk visited the cave during the rescue.  He said he felt sorry that the squabble with Musk had detracted from the successful end to the rescue mission.  \u201cIt\u2019s taken a bit of the pleasure out of what\u2019s happened, what we\u2019ve achieved, for me anyway,\u201d he said, adding that it had upset his ex-wife and daughter back in Britain. \u201cIt\u2019s very much upset my daughter,\u201d the caver said, his voice breaking.  Shares of Tesla Inc fell more than 3.5 percent on Monday, knocking almost $2 billion off the company\u2019s market value.  Several analysts and investors, requesting anonymity, told Reuters that Musk\u2019s comments were adding to their concerns that his public statements were distracting him from Tesla\u2019s main business of producing electric cars.  The \u201cWild Boar\u201d team were rescued last week by a group of foreign and Thai divers through a network of narrow passages and chambers. The boys, aged 11-16, and their 25-year-old coach are expected to leave hospital on Wednesday.  Unsworth was the first foreigner called to the Tham Luang cave in northern Thailand after relatives noticed the boys had not come out after setting out to explore the cave complex on June 23 following soccer practice.  He said he has lost count of how many times he has been inside the 10-km (6-mile) long Tham Luang cave.  \u201cIt has been my third home for the past six years,\u201d he said.  Two British divers who were asked by Unsworth to join the mission were the first to discover the boys.  Unsworth said he brought his knowledge about the cave to the rescue mission but added that he \u201cno idea\u201d what the diving conditions were like because he is not a cave diver.  He said he will fly from Thailand to London on Thursday, where he will stay for around three weeks.","65":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Piedmont Lithium PLL.AX on Monday said it signed a five-year deal with Tesla Inc TSLA.O to supply high-purity lithium ore mineral to the U.S. electric carmaker, prompting an 83% surge in the Australian lithium miner's shares.  The initial five-year agreement implies that Piedmont will supply about a third of its planned 160,000-tonnes-per-year spodumene concentrate produce from its deposits in North Carolina. Both companies have an option to extend the deal for another five years.  Shares of the Australian miner touched their highest since May 2007.  The deal comes on the heels of Tesla\u2019s \u201cBattery Day\u201d presentation last week when Chief Executive Elon Musk shared his vision of novel, proprietary Tesla batteries, following which Tesla stock lost more than $30 billion in market value.  Piedmont said in a statement that the agreement marked the beginning of the its first U.S. domestic lithium supply chain and that talks are ongoing over other sales arrangements.  Tesla did not respond to a Reuters request for comment outside regular business hours.  The deal is conditional upon both companies agreeing to start deliveries between July 2022 and July 2023, the Australian firm said.","66":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Tuesday announced a five-for-one stock split, sending the electric carmaker\u2019s recently high-flying shares up 7% in extended trade.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Tesla\u2019s stock, which traded at $1,475 after the announcement, is among the highest priced on Wall Street, and the Palo Alto, California-based company said in a press release it was looking to make its shares more accessible to employees and investors.  Tesla\u2019s stock has surged over 200% this year, while shares of General Motors and Ford Motor declined on fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.  Stock splits are a way for companies to make shares more accessible to retail investors, potentially attracting individual investors who make small trades. However, brokerages increasingly let customers buy parts of shares, making the benefit of share splits less clear than in the past.  Tesla said stock holders of record on Aug. 21 would receive four additional shares after the close of trading on Aug. 28, with the stock trading on a split-adjusted basis beginning Aug. 31.  Tesla\u2019s stock split follows a four-for-one split announced by Apple Inc in late July, the iPhone maker\u2019s first stock split since 2014.  Stock splits have become rare on Wall Street in recent years, with just three S&P 500 components announcing splits in 2020, compared with an average of 10 a year over the past decade, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.  Tesla in July posted a second-quarter profit as cost cuts and strong deliveries helped offset coronavirus-related factory shutdowns, clearing a hurdle that could lead to the carmaker\u2019s inclusion in the S&P 500 index.  While many institutional investors have avoided Tesla\u2019s stock in recent years due to a lack of consistent profitability, the company has a strong following among individual investors.  Over the past 30 days, Tesla was second only to Apple as the most popular stock on the Robinhood trading app, according to Robintrack, a website that tracks Robinhood holdings.  Tesla\u2019s stock split should not affect S&P Dow Jones Indices\u2019 potential decision to add the company to the S&P 500, which is weighted by companies\u2019 overall stock market values.  The share split will not make Tesla any less expensive in terms of actual earnings it delivers to investors. The stock currently trades at 112 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, according to Refinitiv. By comparison, GM is valued at eight times expected earnings, and Ford at 45 times expected earnings.

REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Tesla Inc plans to announce on Tuesday that it has started selling solar panels and related equipment for up to 16 percent below the national average price, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.  The company aims to cut the prices by standardizing systems and requiring customers order the items online, the report said.  After reporting a 36 percent slide in solar installations in the first quarter, Tesla said last week that it introduced a new solar price and selling strategy without giving any specifics.  In 2016, the electric car maker bought SolarCity for $2.6 billion, through which the company planned to offer solar panels and home battery storage systems to consumers.  Tesla sought to sell solar panels in its retail stores and online in a bid to align it with the company\u2019s aspirational luxury car brand.  The move was a sharp reversal from SolarCity\u2019s populist vision of making rooftop solar accessible to all, and sales under Tesla have lagged. Late last year, Tesla cut prices on its residential solar systems.  At the same time, solar roof tiles that the company unveiled in late 2016 have yet to be produced in meaningful quantities.  Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has said the solar roof, which generates solar energy without the need for traditional rooftop panels, is a cornerstone of his strategy to sell a fossil-fuel-free lifestyle under the Tesla brand.  Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.","68":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O will pause production at its California factory for six days at the end of the May to work on fixes to its assembly line for its new Model 3 sedan, sources inside the company told Reuters.  A Tesla logo is seen in Los Angeles, California U.S. January 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  The Silicon Valley luxury electric car maker previously warned of 10 days of temporary shutdowns this quarter as the company addresses manufacturing problems that have delayed volume production of the Model 3 sedan, which is seen as crucial to Tesla\u2019s long-term profitability.  Two sources confirmed to Reuters that the next stoppage on the general assembly line at the Fremont, California, plant was scheduled for May 26-31.  A Tesla spokesperson declined to comment.  Tesla has been struggling to find solutions to manufacturing bottlenecks on the new assembly line that produces the Model 3, a sedan intended for volume production. An over-reliance on robots has complicated that task, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has acknowledged.  Musk, Tesla\u2019s billionaire founder, told employees it was \u201cquite likely\u201d the company would reach a rate of 500 Model 3s per day this week, or 3,500 a week, automotive news website Electrek reported on Tuesday, citing an internal email. Musk also told staff to alert him of \u201cany specific bottlenecks\u201d on the production line.  The company shut down the Fremont assembly line last month, and also in February, for a few days to rework. The April shutdown, combined with the upcoming one, would add up to the planned 10 days of stoppages.  Musk has said the planned stoppages are intended to give the company time to perform upgrades that will help it reach a goal of building 6,000 vehicles per week by the end of June. Musk last month said the company was producing 2,000 Model 3 cars a week.  In order to meet the goal, Musk said last month that all Model 3 production would begin working around the clock. Reuters learned that the teams working on general assembly have already switched to three shifts, a schedule that helps maximize capacity and flexibility.  Teams working on the body of the vehicle - where the external shell of the car is assembled - are working in two 12-hour shifts.","69":"Oct 2 (Reuters) - A federal judge has ruled that Tesla must defend itself at a trial over allegations it knew foreign workers at one of its facilities were threatened with deportation if they reported an injury and worked long shifts that violated forced labor laws.  U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh, in San Jose, California, rejected on Monday Tesla\u2019s request for an early dismissal of the lawsuit, paving the way for the plaintiffs to seek documents and witnesses to build their case.  The decision comes as Tesla faces intense pressure to turn a profit and days after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk stepped down as chairman to settle allegations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that he misled investors.  Tesla said it investigated the allegations about the foreign workers and broke ties with a subcontractor, ISM Vuzem, that it said did not live up to its expectations. \u201cWe\u2019ve also since improved our supplier contracts and policies to better stop bad behavior,\u201d the statement said.  According to the lawsuit, Gregor Lesnik of Slovenia came to the United States on a B-1 visa and worked 250 hours per month for less than $950, well below minimum wage. It also alleges that foreign workers were threatened with deportation or reduced pay if they reported injuries or became ill.  The 2016 lawsuit by Lesnik and co-plaintiff Stjepan Papes of Croatia and seeks class action status on behalf of foreigners with B-1 visas working at construction sites at U.S. auto plants.  Tesla was one of several automakers named as defendants, but the only one that was not dismissed from the case because plaintiffs only alleged to have suffered threats of deportation at Tesla\u2019s plant in Fremont, California.  Koh denied a motion to dismiss for two Tesla subcontractors, Eisenmann Corp and ISM Vuzem because they operated at the same plant.  Eisenmann and its attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Vuzem of Slovenia did not answer calls placed after hours. The company is not represented by an attorney in the case, according to the court docket.  Koh said her ruling was based on a \u201cgenerous reading of the at times incomprehensible\u201d lawsuit, but also said the allegations against Tesla and Eisenmann were \u201cuncharacteristically specific.\u201d  Koh rejected arguments that Tesla and Eisenmann were not liable because the alleged abuses were committed by Vuzem. Under the law, a party that benefits financially from another\u2019s abuses also bears liability, according to Koh.

The company\u2019s reassurance that it does not need extra cash sent a wave of relief through investors who sold shares of the electric carmaker through a week of bad news about its credit rating and semi-autonomous driving technology.  In early trade on Tuesday, Tesla shares jumped as much as 6.9 percent, recouping a third of the past week\u2019s losses. They were up 3.2 percent at $260 in midday trade.  Musk\u2019s $50-billion dollar venture said it would also churn out 2,000 of the Model 3 cars next week and promised output would climb rapidly through the second quarter.  \u201cTesla continues to target a production rate of approximately 5,000 units per week in about three months, laying the groundwork for Q3 to have the long-sought ideal combination of high volume, good gross margin and strong positive operating cash flow,\u201d the company said in a filing.  \u201cAs a result, Tesla does not require an equity or debt raise this year, apart from standard credit lines.\u201d  Jefferies analysts had estimated that Tesla needed $2.5 billion to $3 billion of fresh equity to fund the Model 3 rampup and several other Wall Street brokerages have predicted the company would need more funds this year.  Some analysts said there were signs that the company might have prioritized the cheaper car, seen as crucial to its profitability, over its Model X SUV and more-established and expensive Model S sedan.  Tesla said first-quarter deliveries totaled 29,980 vehicles, out of which 11,730 were Model S and 10,070 were Model X.  Both were lower from the previous quarter and the first quarter a year ago.  \u201cMaybe Elon Musk switched staff from Model S and X to Model 3 to get better production numbers for Model 3,\u201d said analyst Frank Schwope from NORD\/LB.  Musk himself has taken direct control of Model 3 production and the company says it already has about 500,000 advance reservations from customers for the car.  The Model 3 is the most affordable of Tesla\u2019s cars to date and is the only one capable of transforming the niche automaker into a mass producer amid a sea of rivals entering the nascent electric vehicle market.  Tesla\u2019s consistent failure to meet its production targets - it had promised 2,500 Model 3s would roll off its assembly lines per week by the end of March - has made Wall Street broadly more skeptical about Musk\u2019s promises.  Several criticized as \u201ctone deaf\u201d an April Fool\u2019s tweet from the billionaire that joked his company, which has $10 billion in debt, was \u201ctotally bankrupt\u201d.  Tesla shares peaked at $389 last September and have been declining steadily since.  Analysts, however, are giving the company the benefit of the doubt as a big bet on the future of high-tech electric and self-driving vehicles.  The production numbers, while short of Tesla\u2019s own target, are far above the 793 Model 3s built in the final week of last year.  \u201cThe company appears to be near the point of turning the corner on meeting guidance and production performance,\u201d said William Selesky from Argus Research.

The securities fraud agreement, disclosed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday, will come as a relief to investors, who had worried that a lengthy legal fight would only further hurt the loss-making electric car company.  The SEC on Thursday charged Musk, 47, with misleading investors with tweets on Aug. 7 that said he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share and had secured funding. The tweets had no basis in fact, and the ensuring market chaos hurt investors, it claimed.  Investors and corporate governance experts said the agreement could strengthen Tesla, which has been bruised by Musk\u2019s recent behavior, which included smoking marijuana and wielding a sword on a webcast, and attacking a British rescue diver via Twitter.  The settlement should place more oversight on Musk while not taking the \u201cdevastating\u201d measure of forcing him out, said Steven Heim, a director at Boston Common Asset Management, which owns shares in Tesla battery maker Panasonic Corp.  Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors, and a board committee to set controls over Musk\u2019s communications under the proposed agreement.  \u201cThe prompt resolution of this matter on the agreed terms is in the best interests of our markets and our investors, including the shareholders of Tesla,\u201d SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in a statement.  Thursday\u2019s charges shaved about $7 billion off high-flying Tesla, knocking its market value to $45.2 billion on Friday, below General Motors Co\u2019s $47.5 billion.  In the settlement, the agency pulled back from its demand that Musk, who is synonymous with the Tesla brand, be barred from running Tesla, a sanction that many investors said would be disastrous.  \u201cI think this is the best possible outcome for everyone involved\u201d said Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners, who rates Tesla \u201cneutral\u201d and who called the SEC\u2019s penalty \u201ca slap on the wrist\u201d for Musk.  \u201cThe fact that he can remain CEO is very important for the company.\u201d  Neither Musk nor Tesla admitted or denied the SEC\u2019s findings as part of the settlement, which still must be approved by a court. Tesla and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  HUNT FOR A STRONG CHAIR?  Musk had been directly involved in almost every detail of Tesla\u2019s product design and technology strategy, and drove the company\u2019s employees to extraordinary achievements - much as another Silicon Valley chief executive, Steve Jobs, did at Apple Inc.  The entrepreneur is now required to step down as chairman of Tesla within 45 days, and he is not permitted to be re-elected to the post for three years.  The SEC charged Tesla with failing to have required disclosure controls and procedures for Musk\u2019s tweets. The SEC said the company had no way to determine if his tweets contained information that must be disclosed in corporate filings, or if they contained complete and accurate information.  Musk walked away at the last minute from an earlier settlement with the SEC that would have required him to give up key leadership roles at the company for two years and pay a nominal fine, according to media reports on Friday. Reuters on Friday reported that Musk could settle with the SEC but was ready for a court fight.  FILE PHOTO: Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk attends a forum on startups in Hong Kong, China January 26, 2016. REUTERS\/Bobby Yip\/File Photo  Investors said on Friday that it has been a mistake for Musk to turn down that settlement, especially at a time when the company has been pushing hard to meet aggressive production targets for its Model 3 sedan.  The settlement tasks the Tesla board, which critics have accused of failing to rein in Musk, with the tricky challenge of finding an independent chairman able to work closely with the sometimes unpredictable chief executive.  It was not immediately clear who would be appointed to the role. Antonio Gracias, the current lead independent director and CEO of Valor Equity Partners, has been criticized as being too close to Musk and his companies.  \u201cThe question is whether Musk\u2019s buddies on the board decide to bring in a really strong chair who will stand up to Musk,\u201d said Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor who follows corporate governance.  Musk has driven the company to the verge of profitability with a costly ramp-up of production of its Model 3 over the past year. Electric vehicle news site Electrek reported that Tesla had produced 51,000 Model 3s with a couple of days left in the quarter, hitting its goal of 50,000 to 55,000.  The CEO, who has often turned to Twitter to promote Tesla and confront critics, said on Thursday that the SEC\u2019s actions were unjustified. Tesla shares jumped after his Aug. 7 tweets, a blow to short-sellers betting on the stock\u2019s decline.  As the public face of Tesla, Musk had gained legions of fans for his bold approach to business and technology. He used his Twitter account to promote the achievements of Tesla, his rocket launch company SpaceX, and other projects such as his tunnel venture, the Boring Co, to his nearly 23 million followers.","78":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Thursday introduced a new $45,000 version of its Model 3 sedan on its website, launching the car as U.S. tax breaks for Tesla cars are about to decrease.  According to the website, the rear-wheel-drive model has a \u201cmid range\u201d battery, a range of 260 miles, 50 miles less than the long-range battery that the more expensive Model 3 is equipped with.  The new version has a delivery period of six to 10 weeks, according to the website, which would customers eligible for the current $7,500 U.S. tax credit if they take delivery by the end of the year. The tax credit for Tesla cars will drop by half on Jan. 1.  Although Tesla has promised a base-level version of the Model 3 priced at $35,000, so far it has only produced higher-cost versions starting at about $49,000. Tesla has said that it would not manufacture the base-level version of the Model 3 this year.  Adding the mid-priced version of the Model 3 appears to be a strategic way to lure possible buyers who had been waiting for the lower-priced version. It is not clear how many of the more than 400,000 reservations for the Model 3 are for the base models.","79":"(Refiles to correct spelling of \u201cTesla,\u201d not \u201cTelsa,\u201d in headline of second graphic)  SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 8 (Reuters) - For the first time, Tesla Inc\u2019s stock market value has eclipsed the combined values of General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co.  The Silicon Valley electric car maker\u2019s stock rose about 4%at midday on Wednesday, hitting a record high and elevating its market capitalization to $88 billion. That is $2 billion larger than General Motors\u2019 and Ford\u2019s respective stock market values of $49 billion and $37 billion, combined.  Fueled by a surprise third-quarter profit, progress at a new factory in China and better-than-expected car deliveries in the fourth quarter , Tesla\u2019s stock has nearly doubled in the past three months.  The progress made by Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has defied short sellers and other traders expecting the automaker to be overtaken by long-established car companies, including GM and Ford.  Underscoring investors\u2019 confidence in Musk and his company\u2019s future growth, its market capitalization has outpaced its U.S. rivals, even as their businesses dwarf Tesla\u2019s. GM and Ford each delivered more than 2 million vehicles in the United States last year, compared with Tesla\u2019s worldwide deliveries of 367,500 vehicles.  While Tesla\u2019s recent progress has cheered supporters, many analysts and investors remain pessimistic about the company\u2019s ability to consistently deliver profit and cash flow.  The company has repeatedly missed targets in recent years and Musk\u2019s mercurial behavior has come under close scrutiny from financial regulators and shareholders of Tesla.  More analysts rate Tesla \u201csell\u201d than \u201cbuy,\u201d which is extremely unusual for companies on Wall Street. Eleven analysts recommend buying Tesla shares, while 13 recommend selling and another nine are neutral, according to Refinitiv data.  Shares of GM are unchanged over the past 12 months, while Ford has risen 10%, both drastically underperforming the broader market, with a slump in China car sales hurting investor sentiment in both of those companies.

Its inclusion will also force actively managed funds that try to beat the S&P 500 to grapple with a question many have avoided for years: whether to own shares of Wall Street\u2019s most controversial companies, and if so, how many?  \u201cTesla is a very under-owned stock across actively managed funds,\u201d said King Lip, chief investment strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco, which owns Tesla shares.  \u201cIf Tesla starts to take off\u2026 and if they don\u2019t own Tesla, then they are going to underperform by a pretty meaty amount,\u201d he said.  Many fund managers until now have avoided Tesla, according to Lip, because its low profitability and high debt exclude it from screening lists drawn up by fund managers considering new investments.  Refinitiv Eikon data shows that, excluding index funds, about 700 investment funds own or recently owned Tesla, compared to over 2,100 funds owning Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N, an S&P 500 component with a value similar to Tesla.  Up over 400% in 2020, the California-based car maker has become the most valuable auto company in the world, by far, despite production that is a fraction of rivals such as Toyota Motor 7203.T, Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE and General Motors GM.N.  Entry to the S&P 500 will put Tesla among the index's 10 most valuable companies, larger than JPMorgan Chase JPM.N and approaching the value of Visa V.N.  Many investors believe Tesla\u2019s stock is in a bubble, and some have warned against adding it to the S&P 500 at current levels. Adding to uncertainty around Tesla is Chief Executive Elon Musk, viewed by many as a genius entrepreneur, but who in 2018 agreed to pay $20 million and step down as chairman to settle fraud charges.  With Tesla in the S&P 500, actively managed funds that avoid its shares will risk falling behind if Tesla\u2019s blistering rally continues. On the other hand, they may find themselves ahead if they keep the company out of their portfolios and the stock\u2019s high-flying performance reverses.  \u201cMany active managers shadow the S&P 500, so this makes it more difficult for them to ignore Tesla,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.  Krosby compared Tesla\u2019s inclusion in the S&P 500 to China\u2019s gradual addition in recent years to MSCI\u2019s widely tracked equity benchmarks, which led global investors that rate their performance against those indexes to pour hundreds of billions of dollars into the country\u2019s stock markets.  Adding companies with extremely high stock market values to the S&P 500 is exceedingly rare, and S&P Dow Jones Indices said Tesla\u2019s addition will generate a massive amount of trading by index funds. To ease its addition, S&P Dow Jones Indices said it may add Tesla to the index in two parts, with the company fully added as of Dec. 21.  \u201cMany so-called active management funds are benchmark huggers and now they\u2019re going to have to tinker with what weighting to apply\u201d to Tesla, said David Barse of index company XOUT Capital. \u201cMany of them are going to realize they have to add it.\u201d","81":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla's TSLA.O stock tumbled 17% on Wednesday, hitting the brakes on a dramatic rally as a senior executive said the coronavirus outbreak in China would delay deliveries of its Model 3 cars and analysts warned of its high valuation.  FILE PHOTO: A Tesla sign is seen on the Shanghai Gigafactory of the U.S. electric car maker before a delivery ceremony in Shanghai, China January 7, 2020. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  With Tesla still up more than 25% since the company posted its second consecutive quarterly profit a week ago, Canaccord Genuity cut its rating on Tesla to \u201chold\u201d from \u201cbuy,\u201d further shrinking the already small number of analysts who recommend buying the stock.  Tesla Vice President Tao Lin said on the Weibo social media platform that car deliveries from its new Shanghai plant would be temporarily delayed and that the company planned to restart production on Feb. 10.  The $2 billion factory is a key part of Chief Executive Elon Musk\u2019s plan to make more than half a million automobiles this year.  Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill, who recommends selling Tesla, warned in a report that Tesla\u2019s stock is trading at extreme price-to-earnings multiples compared to many leading technology companies.  Even after Wednesday's drop, Tesla is trading at about 55 times expected 2021 net income, compared to Amazon AMZN.O at 49, Apple AAPL.O at 22 and Alphabet GOOGL.O at 23, according to Refinitiv data.  \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen a stock rise that much that fast with such little regard to past fundamentals or track record,\u201d Gill wrote.  Tesla last week said it expected a delay of up to a week and a half in the ramp-up of Model 3 production at the Shanghai plant after the Chinese government ordered it to shut the factory due to the outbreak.  The coronavirus outbreak has disrupted business across China, with the government there saying that the death toll had reached 490 as of Tuesday, up 65 from the previous day.  \u201cGiven the 3,000 per week China Model 3 production expectations in a country that remains on lockdown, we feel a reset of expectations in Q1 is likely and thus needs to be reflected in the valuation,\u201d Canaccord analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote in a report, leaving his price target unchanged at $750 per share.  The stock was last down 17% at about $738. Wednesday\u2019s drop followed a sudden selloff in the final minutes of a rally on Tuesday that still left the stock up almost 14% in that session.  Tesla\u2019s rally of over 300% since early June has been a vindication for Musk, who has transformed a niche car maker with production problems into the global leader in electric vehicles, with U.S. and Chinese factories.  Still, many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth in the face of competition from established rivals including BMW BMWG.DE and Volkswagen VOWG.DE. Even many Tesla bulls question the stock's valuation following its recent, electrifying surge.  Barclays analyst Brian Johnson maintained his \u201cunderweight\u201d rating on Tesla while raising his price target to $300 from $200.  \u201cWe continue to believe TSLA is fundamentally overvalued \u2013 but nevertheless concede that the recent price action opens up the possibility of raising capital cheaply, and hence reduces that chance of a stalled business,\u201d Johnson wrote in a client note.  Following Canaccord\u2019s downgrade, nine analysts recommend buying Tesla\u2019s stock, while 11 analysts are neutral and 15 analysts recommend selling, according to Refinitiv.  The median price target of analysts is $390.","82":"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Elon Musk raised an online storm by dancing on stage at the launch of Tesla's TSLA.O Model Y electric sports utility vehicle program on Tuesday in its new Shanghai factory, where the company delivered its first cars built outside the United States to the public.  The $2 billion Tesla Inc factory started delivering cars in just 357 days, a record for global automakers in China. The first 10 customers from the public received their China-made Model 3 sedans on Tuesday.  Billionaire CEO Musk danced enthusiastically on stage at the event, then stripped off his jacket and flung it aside to reveal a T-shirt with a cartoon of the factory. In a tweet, he labeled the video \u201cNSFW\u201d - not safe for work.  He predicted that \u201cultimately Tesla Model Y will have more demand than probably all the other cars of Tesla combined\u201d, with his voice cracking with emotion at times while talking about the progress of the Shanghai factory.  Musk\u2019s tweet of him dancing was viewed 2.5 million times and drew unflattering comparisons to famous Silicon Valley footage of Microsoft chiefs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer dancing awkwardly at a 1990s Windows launch.  \"Admit it Elon, you did it for the memes,\" one user tweeted here, along with a picture of Musk stripping off his jacket. \"I see you learned your dance moves at Dad school,\" said another.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  \u201cJust tryin to grow my follower count on pornhub \u2026,\u201d the billionaire, who has a history of being playful with his Twitter account, retorted.  The ceremony was attended by Shanghai Mayor Ying Yong and other senior government officials.  Tesla executives, however, did not provide further details on the progress of the China-made Model Y project. A Tesla representative declined to comment further.  Tesla\u2019s shares, which have jumped about 10% since the beginning of this year, are trading close to their record high after the company beat Wall Street estimates for vehicle deliveries in its fourth quarter.  The positive news from the China factory have also caused a rally in shares of Tesla's Chinese suppliers. Shares of Tianjin Motor Dies Co Ltd 002510.SZ have surged about 28% so far in 2020, while VT Industrial Technology Co Ltd 300707.SZ is up nearly 6%.  Construction of Tesla\u2019s first plant outside the United States began in January 2019 and production started in October.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  The factory started with a production capacity of 150,000 Model 3 sedans and Tesla aims to push that to 250,000 vehicles a year, including Model Y, in the plant\u2019s first phase.  Tesla unveiled its Model Y in March 2019 and said in October that production of the electric compact SUV at its Fremont facility was running ahead of schedule, adding at the time that it expects to launch the model by summer 2020.  It has said that margin expectations are higher for Model Y than Model 3, while production costs are roughly the same.  Tesla\u2019s China website estimates the starting price for Model Y vehicles at 444,000 yuan ($63,911.56). It will announce the retail price later, the website says. The China-made Model 3 sedans are priced at 355,800 yuan before subsidies.  Shanghai Vice Mayor Wu Qing said he hoped to see Tesla extend its cooperation with the city and for the car maker to manufacture more models at its Chinese plant.","83":"(Reuters) - A federal judge in San Francisco dismissed a securities fraud lawsuit in which Tesla Inc TSLA.O shareholders accused the electric car company and Chief Executive Elon Musk of misleading them about the progress of production of its Model 3 vehicle.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  In a decision made public on Monday, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said that while shareholders claimed that Tesla fell short of its production goals, \u201cfederal securities laws do not punish companies for failing to achieve their targets.\u201d  Breyer said the shareholders have until Sept. 28 to amend their complaint. Their lawyer, Laurence Rosen, did not respond to a request for comment.  The case is separate from lawsuits accusing Tesla and Musk of scheming to hurt short-sellers through Musk\u2019s Aug. 7 tweets about taking the Palo Alto, California-based company private, and that funding had been \u201csecured.\u201d  Musk abandoned that proposal late Friday night.  Tesla formally launched the Model 3 in July 2017, touting it as a vehicle for the masses, and attracted deposits from more than 500,000 potential customers.  But shareholders said Musk knew Tesla was \u201cwoefully unprepared\u201d to meet its production goal of 5,000 Model 3s per week, and that Tesla\u2019s share price was inflated until after the company finally cut its production target last November.  Belief in the Model 3 had helped propel Tesla\u2019s share price 62 percent higher in the 1-1\/2 years after the Palo Alto, California-based company unveiled it in March 2016.  But the judge said shareholders failed to show that Tesla needed to be clearer that Model 3 production could fall short.  The company eventually blamed its production shortfall on \u201cbottlenecks\u201d at its battery factory outside Reno, Nevada and its assembly plant in Fremont, California.  \u201cPlaintiffs are correct that defendants\u2019 qualifications would not have been meaningful if defendants had known that it was impossible for Tesla to meet its stated production goals, not merely highly unlikely,\u201d Breyer wrote. \u201cThe facts plaintiffs have put forth do not tend to establish that this was the case.\u201d  Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Breyer\u2019s decision is dated Aug. 24.

REUTERS\/Rashid Umar Abbasi  WASHINGTON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk\u2019s idea of taking the company private faces risks beyond the financial and disclosure-related kind. Saudi Arabia\u2019s help in a buyout could spur national-security scrutiny under the newly expanded powers of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.  Musk said on Monday that Saudi investment overtures made him confident he could secure funding to buy the $60 billion Tesla. The same day, President Donald Trump signed into law a bill that overhauled CFIUS, which is led by the Treasury Department. The committee reviews overseas investments in U.S. companies for national-security concerns and can block deals or force divestitures.  Its increased authority allows CFIUS to examine non-controlling investments in critical technology. Because the committee still has to write new rules, it\u2019s unclear whether Tesla would fall into that category. If the Saudi Public Investment Fund were to take a majority stake, it would draw a CFIUS review regardless - though that\u2019s not the likelihood. Still, the carmaker is known as an innovator and owns advanced battery technology. Trump officials have also expressed concern about China\u2019s Made in 2025 program, which includes electric vehicles, perhaps increasing sensitivities about even minority stakes in U.S. EV proponents.  Such considerations help explain why Saudi\u2019s PIF has been raising its lobbying game. It hired law firm Akin Gump to advise on CFIUS matters, according to a March 8 filing with the Justice Department. The previous day, virtual-reality startup Magic Leap said it had raised $400 million from the fund - although the 7 percent stake wouldn\u2019t have drawn CFIUS scrutiny at that time.  Another possible hiccup is Congress. In 2006, a state-owned Dubai company obtained CFIUS approval to manage operations at six U.S. ports but faced political opposition, forcing it to drop the deal. A potential Saudi-Tesla deal has not yet drawn similar scrutiny, but that could change once lawmakers return to Washington in September.  Saudi Arabia has its share of critics, too. In 2016, the kingdom alienated many politicians with its opposition to a bill allowing families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks to sue the nation for its alleged involvement. It all adds up to one more uncertainty for Musk\u2019s convoluted plans.","85":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of the Bitcoin digital currency is seen in a shop in Marseille, France, February 7, 2021.

Tesla said on Tuesday that any of its cars sold in China would be subject to adjusted prices, even before the tariff change comes into effect on July 1.  The price of a top-of-the range Model X will be cut to 1.3 million yuan ($203,830) but that remains well above the $140,000 cash price-tag before savings for the priciest version in the United States - Tesla\u2019s Model X P100D.  The move by the California-based electric carmaker likely foreshadows wider price cuts for imported cars in China as foreign firms look to narrow a price gap with domestic rivals. Imports, however, only make up a fraction of the overall market and tend to be upper-end models.  Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight, said price cuts by foreign premium brands will likely force them to adjust the price tag for vehicles they produce locally in China. This in turn will gradually impact the price of more affordable, mainstream cars - even local Chinese brands.  \u201cWith imminent price adjustments in the higher-end segment, that will over time lead to a pricing adjustment for the entire market,\u201d Zhang said.

Johan de Nysschen, who was then Cadillac\u2019s president, told Reuters at the Detroit auto show in January 2018 the luxury brand will play a \u201ccentral role\u201d in GM\u2019s electrification strategy, including China. He added that Cadillac would be \u201cat the forefront\u201d of rolling out new electric vehicles in the United States and China. He left GM in April.  This week, GM said Cadillac sales in China rose 17.2 percent in 2018, surpassing 200,000 units for the first time. GM Chief Executive Mary Barra has said that GM aims to sell 1 million electric vehicles a year by 2026, many of them in China, which has set strict production quotas on such vehicles.  Barra said in 2017 the company plans to introduce at least 10 new electric or hybrid vehicles to the Chinese market by 2020. GM opened a battery plant with Chinese partner SAIC Motor Corp Ltd 600104.SS last year.  In October, GM urged the Trump administration to back a nationwide program to boost sales of zero emission vehicles like electric cars, even as the government has proposed ending California\u2019s ability to require more clean vehicles.","95":"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text)  SAN FRANCISCO\/LOS ANGELES, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc\u2019s production of solar roof tiles has been delayed by assembly-line problems at its new publicly subsidized factory and difficulties producing a product that satisfies the aesthetic demands of CEO Elon Musk, eight former and current employees of both companies told Reuters.  Repeated hold-ups since the Buffalo, New York plant opened last year have forced Tesla\u2019s partner in the joint venture, Panasonic, to seek other buyers for the components it had built to sell to Tesla, according to a Panasonic employee, a former Panasonic employee and a former Tesla employee. The issues have also rattled the faith of state officials in Tesla\u2019s ability to deliver on investment and employment promises it made in exchange for $750 million in state subsidies.  The production challenges add to doubts over Tesla\u2019s cash-strapped solar operations as it focuses on boosting production of its better-known electric vehicles, which have also seen repeated production delays. Tesla acquired the solar business in 2016 in a controversial $2.6 billion purchase of SolarCity - a sales and installation company founded by two of Musk\u2019s cousins - but the business has been shrinking ever since.  (For a graphic showing the decline in Tesla's solar business, see: tmsnrt.rs\/2KjWlYU )  The \u201cSolar Roof\u201d produced at the New York factory is designed to look like a normal roof while generating electricity, a combination that has proved challenging.  \u201cAesthetic look is the key point that Elon is always not satisfied with,\u201d said another former Tesla employee, who works in Fremont, California. \u201cThat\u2019s the big issue.\u201d  In a call with Tesla investors last week, Musk said \u201chundreds\u201d of homes already had solar roofs, but the company clarified the estimate in its statement to Reuters, saying it included systems that had been partially installed or were \u201cbeing scheduled for install.\u201d  In California, the nation\u2019s leading solar market, there were twelve Tesla roof systems connected to the grid as of May 31, all in Northern California, according to records from the state\u2019s three investor-owned utilities. The cost per watt for those systems was listed at nearly $6, according to the records. That\u2019s about double the national average for solar systems.  Tesla began accepting $1,000 deposits from customers for the Solar Roofs in May 2017, seven months after it unveiled a prototype.  Tesla confirmed in a statement to Reuters that it has been seeking to improve on its production process for the solar roof at the New York plant.  \u201cWe are steadily ramping up Solar Roof production in Buffalo and are also continuing to iterate on the product design and production process,\u201c the company said in the statement. \u201cWe plan to ramp production more toward the end of 2018.\u201d  The company did not detail its current production and did not comment on its component purchases from partner Panasonic, which shares space in the factory and plans to produce Tesla solar panels and photovoltaic cells for the roofs.  Panasonic has been selling some of the solar panels it produces in Buffalo under its own brand instead of selling them to Tesla, Panasonic said in a statement.  It has also been shipping a large volume of the photovoltaic cells it produces in Buffalo as samples to prospective buyers because of low demand from Tesla, according to the Panasonic employee and a former Tesla employee.  Panasonic declined to comment on the shipments of cell samples to other customers but said in a statement that it has not yet completed sales to buyers other than Tesla or signed alternate supply deals.  \u201cWe believe Tesla will use Panasonic cells when it mass-markets the Solar Roof,\u201d the company said in a statement.  Some New York state lawmakers worry Tesla may fail to hold up its end of the bargain. The state provided $350 million to build the factory, along with $274.7 million for equipment and $125.3 million \u201cfor additional specified scope costs,\u201d according to a Tesla filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The subsidy package requires Tesla to employ 1,460 people in Buffalo, including 500 at the plant, within two years of the facility\u2019s completion, and to spend $5 billion in the state over a decade.  Empire State Development, the state\u2019s economic development arm, is overseeing the agreement. The agency believes Tesla is currently meeting its obligations, said spokeswoman Pamm Lent, adding that the company would face penalties of $41.2 million a year if it falters.  Republican New York state Assemblyman Ray Walter, who represents a district near the factory, said it concerned him that only a small portion of the plant appeared functional when he toured it in March.  \u201cAfter investing $750 million of taxpayer money, we want it to work out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just does not look like it\u2019s heading down that path.\u201d  Tesla said in its statement that the facility now employs about 600 people and is on track to meet all of its commitments.  None of the Tesla sources could provide a production figure for the solar roof, saying only that output was low and frequently interrupted. They said only the textured black version of the solar roof had been produced so far, one of four varieties Tesla is marketing.  Several of the sources at the plant said Musk had never visited the site; Tesla declined to comment.  EQUIPMENT IN BOXES  Panasonic recently produced about 1,900 conventional 325-watt solar panels per day at the plant, meant to be sold under the Tesla brand, and about 2,000 5.5-watt photovoltaic cells per day that were intended for the solar roof, according to two Panasonic sources, one who recently left the company.  That would put annualized production at about a quarter of Tesla\u2019s target for the plant, which is 1 gigawatt per year by 2019. And Tesla isn\u2019t buying most of the cells being produced, according to the Panasonic employee.  \u201cWe have been entertaining outside customers,\u201d the employee said.  Tesla is also turning to other suppliers to deal with the aesthetic concerns, using cells from JA Solar because they reflect light differently, said a current Tesla employee and a former Tesla employee. The current employee said a similar Panasonic cell was now undergoing testing and would be used in future versions of the solar roof.  JA Solar declined to comment.  Panasonic started cell production at the factory in February, but recently shut down manufacturing to install new equipment on its production lines, the Panasonic employee said. Full production will restart in September, the employee said.  For now, wooden crates filled with unused equipment are sitting around the factory, according to the Panasonic employee and three other employees with knowledge of the plant operations. Some of that equipment has become obsolete over the past couple of years as technology has changed, two of the workers said.  MIXED REVIEWS  One of the few customers that has taken delivery of the Solar Roof is Tri Huynh, 39, who works in business development in Silicon Valley. Huynh said he paid about $100,000 for the system, which included three Tesla Powerwall home batteries to store the power produced.  It took two weeks and a dozen workers to install, compared to a day for most traditional panel systems.  \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic. I love it,\u201d he said, adding he was saving hundreds of dollars a month in power costs. \u201cI\u2019m a tech guy, so I kind of wanted the latest technology.\u201d  Warren Jason, a retired technology entrepreneur who is building an 11,000-square-foot house in the Hollywood Hills, is not so pleased.  He put down $1,000 to reserve a roof in early 2017 but it has not yet arrived, and he has been unable to get details to give to his architect and engineers.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been begging Tesla for information,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been extremely frustrating.\u201d (Additional reporting by Makiko Yamazaki and Ritsuko Ando in Tokyo; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Brian Thevenot)","96":"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Kidman Resources, a supplier of lithium to U.S. electric car maker Tesla said on Monday it had settled a court dispute that could have derailed joint development of a mine in Western Australian with Chile\u2019s SQM.  In a statement announcing the settlement, Kidman did not specify terms. Court documents show the settlement was reached with private company Phoenix Rise and Jeffrey Hull, a retired geologist.  Phoenix Rise and Hull had separately flagged that not enough had been invested enough in the Mount Holland site under government regulations before Kidman acquired it, and applied for the tenement holdings to be forfeited to them.  \u201cThis settlement resolves this matter completely,\u201d Kidman Chief Executive Martin Donohoe said in a statement which described the settlement sum as \u201cnot material\u201d.  Phoenix Rise could not be reached for comment and Hull declined to comment.  The settlement unlocks payments by SQM that had been on ice during the dispute, and paves the way for development to get back on track. Kidman signed a deal to supply Tesla in May for when its operations are up and running in 2021.  The dispute centered on how little money had been spent on the exploration holdings to develop them, prior to Kidman\u2019s purchase of the site in early 2016. The mine is being developed by Covalent Lithium, a 50-50 joint venture between Kidman and SQM.  Kidman bought the right to develop the lithium tenements for $3.5 million in early 2016. A year later, SQM invested $110 million into the project to produce lithium carbonate and hydroxide for batteries used in electric vehicles.  Under a Western Australian state law to discourage land banking, if a leaseholder has not spent a mininum amount on exploration, another party can petition for the land holding to be forfeited.  Shares in Kidman Resources traded up 7 percent at $1.43 by 0328 GMT.","97":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed lower for a third straight session on Tuesday as heavyweight technology names extended their sell-off, while Tesla suffered its biggest daily percentage drop after the stock was passed over for inclusion in the S&P 500.

Reports on Friday that SoftBank 9984.T made significant option purchases during the run-up in U.S. stocks added to investor nervousness.  Technology once again dragged indexes lower with a drop of more than 3%, the third straight decline and worst three-day performance for the sector since mid-March. Even with the recent drop, the sector remains the best performer on the year.  \u201cThings got expensive, they ran up, they got very concentrated and people got really giddy,\u201d said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. \u201cEveryone is all loaded up on one side, it doesn\u2019t take much of a ripple to knock some apples off the cart.\u201d  Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 631.89 points, or 2.25%, to 27,501.42, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 95.11 points, or 2.78%, to 3,331.85 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 465.44 points, or 4.11%, to 10,847.69.  Energy shares slumped as oil prices fell below $40 a barrel.  Media reports of SoftBank\u2019s option purchases also reminded investors that market makers might have billions of dollars\u2019 worth of long positions as hedges against options trades.  Wall Street\u2019s rally, which has been fueled in large part by massive amounts of monetary and fiscal stimulus, screeched to a halt last week with the Nasdaq falling as much as 9.9% from its intraday record as investors booked profits after a run that lifted the index about 70% from its pandemic lows.  At session lows on Tuesday, Facebook FB.O, Amazon.com AMZN.O, Apple AAPL.O, Tesla TSLA.O, Microsoft MSFT.O, Alphabet GOOGL.O and Netflix NFLX.O had collectively lost more than $1 trillion in market capitalization since Sept. 2.  Tesla plunged to suffer its biggest daily percentage drop as the electric-car maker was excluded from a group of companies being added to the S&P 500. Investors had widely expected its inclusion after a blockbuster quarterly earnings report in July. Up to Friday\u2019s close, the stock had surged about 400% this year.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under President Donald Trump has moved away from the practice of leveling huge monetary penalties against corporations.  That enforcement trend, according to four experts, could benefit Tesla as the company faces an SEC investigation of CEO Elon Musk\u2019s Aug. 7 tweet about \u201csecured\u201d financing for a private buyout of the company.  \u201cI expect Tesla to pay zero,\u201d said Georgetown law professor Urska Velikonja, who is engaged in an ongoing analysis of SEC enforcement trends against companies and individuals.  SEC Chair Jay Clayton has emphasized accountability for individual wrongdoers, rather than holding corporations responsible for employees\u2019 misconduct.  Even if the commission ultimately concludes Musk's tweet was unfounded, the Tesla CEO's potential penalty would probably be less than $200,000, according to two securities law professors and a defense lawyer who tracks SEC enforcement at the SEC Actions blog.  Tesla declined to comment on the experts\u2019 assessment of potential exposure to the SEC.  Lawyers from Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz, which represents Tesla CEO Musk, did not immediately respond to an email request for comment. The SEC declined to comment.  SHARP DROP IN PENALTIES  Last year, Georgetown's Velikonja documented a sharp drop in total penalties assessed by the commission after Clayton took over as chairman. This year \u2013 Clayton\u2019s first full year as SEC chair \u2013 the decline is even more notable.  According to Velikonja, the agency has assessed about $592 million in monetary penalties in cases settled in the first 10.5 months of fiscal year 2018, which ends next month. Those are the lowest aggregated SEC penalties in at least a decade, Velikonja said. The previous low, according to the Georgetown professor, was $656 million over the same 10.5 month-period in fiscal year 2012.  The drop in penalties reflects the SEC\u2019s pivot away from the quasi-prosecutorial role it adopted after big financial frauds in the 2000s.  \u201cThe Clayton administration is trying to bring the agency back to its roots in civil enforcement,\u201d said securities defense lawyer Stephen Crimmins of Murphy & McGonigle. \u201cThe focus is on putting in place structural changes\u201d to avert future misconduct, according to Crimmins.  The commission has also emphasized penalizing individual wrongdoers rather than corporations, on the theory that shareholders should not bear the cost of their own deception. As a company, said Michigan law professor Adam Pritchard, Tesla issued a \u201cmeasured and responsible\u201d statement after Musk tweeted his go-private plan.  \u201cTesla should not and won\u2019t be sanctioned,\u201d Pritchard said.  What about Musk himself?  The full story behind Musk\u2019s tweet about the financing of a buyout is not publicly known, though Tesla on Monday posted a blog entry in which the CEO said he was referring to funding assurances from the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund.  Defense lawyer Crimmins said SEC investigators will likely look for documentary evidence and testimony to back or refute Musk\u2019s assertion that he reasonably believed the Saudi fund would finance his contemplated buyout.  SEC investigations can take years but Crimmins said this inquiry seems straightforward and could be concluded quickly.  Thomas Gorman, a securities defense lawyer at Dorsey & Whitney who authors a blog about SEC enforcement, said the facts that have already emerged make it unlikely the SEC will bring a case against Musk.  \u201cNOT THE STUFF OF GOVERNMENT ACTION\u201d  \u201cWhile one might select better language if the sentence was wordsmithed, that (tweet) is not the stuff of a government enforcement action,\u201d Gorman said.  If the SEC does conclude Musk\u2019s tweet was misleading, three experts said, his penalty will probably be a relatively paltry amount - less than $200,000.  That amount could be higher, according to Crimmins, if the commission determines Musk\u2019s tweet was fraudulent, not merely negligent.  The SEC has so far targeted 63 individuals for reporting violations in fiscal year 2018, according to Velikonja\u2019s analysis. They have paid on average a $75,000 penalty.  Federal regulations permit the SEC to seek up to $160,000 from individuals for each securities violation. The SEC has in the past devised ways to multiply violations to increase penalties but defense lawyer Gorman and law professors Velikonja and Pritchard said the commission would probably count Musk\u2019s tweet as a single violation if it determined the assertion of secure funding to have been misleading.  \u201cThe value of the case for the SEC is sending a message,\u201d said Velikonja. \u201cThis would be the SEC saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to go after the biggest guys. We\u2019re not afraid of Elon Musk.\u2019\u201d  The commission can also seek injunctions. The most extreme punishment the SEC can impose is a prohibition on serving as an officer or director of a public company. Experts do not expect such a draconian penalty in the Tesla case, especially, according to Crimmins, because Musk is so integral to the company\u2019s prospects.  But if the commission finds a violation, the SEC could enjoin Musk and Tesla from future misleading communications. That sort of prohibition, said Michigan prof Pritchard, would mean more severe consequences for subsequent breaches of securities law.  The SEC can even insist that Musk and Tesla agree to vet future market-moving tweets with securities lawyers before they\u2019re posted, according to Crimmins.  \u201cThat would be an elegant solution,\u201d he said.","99":"SEOUL (Reuters) - From an eponymous cocktail to eager buyers following the shipping routes of long-awaited cars, Tesla Inc TSLA.O is having a moment in South Korea, particularly among tech-savvy professionals.  Kang Sung-mo, who runs an advertising production agency in Seoul, is a convert.  \u201cI am not interested in cars, but I am interested in the Tesla brand and its technology,\u201d the 39-year-old told Reuters.  Kang bought a Tesla Model 3 in December, ditching the Hyundai crossover he bought only last summer. Being associated with Tesla\u2019s reputation for innovation was good for his image, he said.  The U.S. electric car maker had its best month for South Korea in June, selling 2,827 vehicles and bouncing back from weak sales in April and May which were hit by U.S. production disruptions due to the coronavirus. The Model 3 is now the country\u2019s No.2 imported vehicle, ahead of the BMW 5 series and the Audi A6, and just behind the Mercedes E-Class.  By contrast, Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS, the dominant automaker in South Korea, saw sales of its Kona EV slump 31% in June to 2,513 vehicles.  Another 4,000 to 5,000 South Korean customers have the Model 3 on order, although most of them may have to wait until at least September for delivery, said a source familiar with the matter. The source was not authorised to speak to the media and declined to be identified.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Tesla\u2019s rising popularity among affluent professionals in South Korea, who have been relatively unscathed by the pandemic, is one of many feathers in its cap.  Highlighting the threat it poses to established brands, Tesla last week surpassed Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T as the world's most valuable automaker while its second-quarter deliveries smashed expectations at a time when sales at rivals have been laid low by the pandemic.  South Korea\u2019s generous subsidies of 12.43 million won ($10,380) for the Model 3 have definitely helped sales, bringing the car\u2019s price down to less than $40,000, but the Silicon Valley automaker has also generated a genuine buzz.  In social media posts, South Korean Tesla fans avidly track the routes of ships bringing its cars to Asia, while at the country's bars, the latest trendy cocktail is a mix of HiteJinro's 000080.KS Terra-brand beer and the Korean traditional liquor 'soju'. Smashed together, their names are pronounced \"Tesla\" in Korean.  The automaker has additionally benefited from free advertising after popular Korean actor Yoo Ah-in, known for his sense of style, drove his Tesla Model X SUV to go grocery shopping on a reality show aired last month. That has led to a spike in orders for the vehicle, a second person familiar with the matter said without elaborating.  Some new Korean owners noted they bought a Tesla for practical reasons.  Kim Dong-hwan, who works in IT in Seoul, wanted to avoid public transportation during the pandemic and driving fatigue on his long commute.  Not everything is perfect - his Model 3 has a panel gap and he has to wait several months before it will be fixed - but Kim says the benefits and emotional appeal of a technologically advanced brand were worth it.  \u201cI am very satisfied given that Tesla\u2019s self-driving feature has reduced fatigue while driving,\u201d he said.","100":"Slideshow ( 3 images )  (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O will fall short of its 2,500 per week target for production of the crucial Model 3 sedan when it reports its numbers this week, according to a report by tech website Jalopnik, citing an email from Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk to employees.  Musk told employees in a company-wide email on Monday that Tesla had just passed a rate of 2,000 per week, the report said.

FILE PHOTO: Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk attends the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai, China August 29, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song  A blistering stock rally has bolstered the value of CEO Musk\u2019s 19% stake in the electric car maker by $16 billion since the start of 2020, to $30 billion.  Tuesday\u2019s steep climb in the share price could sweeten Musk\u2019s payday under his record-breaking compensation package, which is built on stock options that rely on market value targets. Two milestones have now been achieved that could see Musk unlock options worth $1.8 billion.  The controversial chief executive, who is also the majority owner and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, recently testified that he did not have a lot of cash as he successfully defended himself in a defamation lawsuit. He previously has taken loans using his Tesla shares as collateral.  Musk does not take a salary, choosing instead a risky options package that envisions the stock market value of Tesla rising to $650 billion over 10 years, a prospect that was derided by some investors when the deal was announced in 2018.  That target now looks less crazy. Shares of Tesla have rallied over 50% since the company posted its second consecutive quarterly profit last Wednesday, which was viewed as a major accomplishment for a company competing against established automotive heavyweights including General Motors Co and BMW.  Tesla shares have climbed about 400% since early June, helped by the company\u2019s better-than-expected financial results and ramped-up production at its new car factory in Shanghai.  On Tuesday, Tesla surged as much as 24% before falling back in the final minutes of the trading session to end the day up 13.7%. That put its market capitalization at $160 billion, almost twice the combined value of Ford Motor and General Motors.  The shares had also rallied on Monday, partly fueled by Panasonic Corp\u2019s saying its automotive battery venture with Tesla was profitable for the first time.  The options Musk was awarded in 2018 vest incrementally based on targets for Tesla\u2019s stock market value and its financial performance. The market capitalization would have to sustainably rise by $50 billion increments over the agreement\u2019s 10-year period, with the full package payout reached if the market cap reaches $650 billion, as well as the company\u2019s meeting revenue and profit targets.  Musk is on his way to seeing his first two tranches of options vest. He achieved operational targets on revenue and adjusted earnings last year.  The rise in Tesla\u2019s market capitalization last month to a target of $100 billion opened the way for Musk\u2019s first tranche of options to vest. With Tuesday\u2019s surging share price, the market capitalization blew past the second target of $150 billion, opening the way for the second tranche to vest. Tesla\u2019s market capitalization must stay at or above each target level for one- and six-month averages for each set of options to vest.  Tesla was valued at about $52 billion when shareholders approved the pay package in March 2018, a time when the company faced a cash crunch, production delays and increasing competition from rivals.  A full payoff for Musk would surpass anything previously granted to U.S. executives, according to Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisor that recommended investors reject the pay package deal at the time.  Musk currently owns about 34 million Tesla shares, and his compensation package would let him buy another 20.3 million shares if all his options tranches vest.  When Tesla unveiled Musk\u2019s package, it said he could in theory reap as much as $55.8 billion if no new shares were issued. However, Tesla has since awarded stock to employees and last year sold $2.7 billion in shares and convertible bonds, diluting the value of the stock.  Musk has transformed Tesla from a niche car maker with production problems into the global leader in electric vehicles, with U.S. and Chinese factories. So far it has stayed ahead of more established rivals including BMW and Volkswagen.  Many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth. More Wall Street analysts rate Tesla \u201csell\u201d than \u201cbuy,\u201d and the company\u2019s stock is the most shorted on Wall Street.","102":"BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital hedge fund, whose bets on car companies General Motors GM.N and Tesla TSLA.O both moved against him in August, lost 7.6 percent this month, leaving the fund down 25.1 percent for the year, two investors said on Friday.

Tesla is using the Nordschleife, as the track is known, to market its \u201cPlaid\u201d mode on a 7-seater Tesla Model S, CEO Elon Musk confirmed on Twitter.  \u201cWe expect these track times to be beaten by the actual production 7 seat Model S Plaid variant that goes into production around Oct\/Nov next year,\u201d Musk said on Tuesday.  Setting a new record time for four-door electric cars would give the U.S.-based manufacturer\u2019s ageing Model S a new lease of life just as Audi, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Porsche prepare to launch electric cars.  The Nordschleife is one of the world\u2019s most treacherous thanks to its length of just over 20 km (12.5 miles), slanted cambers and an altitude difference of 300 meters (yards) between its highest and lowest point.  Porsche says its 919 Evo hybrid racecar currently holds the record with a lap time of 5 minutes 19 seconds, set in 2018 by keeping up an average speed of 234 km (146.3 miles) an hour, despite blind corners, narrow bends and limited safety run-off zones.  Porsche, BMW, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Cadillac and Aston Martin have used the racetrack as a boot camp to hone reliability and handling and to benchmark their vehicles against top competitors.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  \u201cIf you take the same corner, on the same road, at the same speed, in two different cars, you can see how your car measures up to the competition,\u201d said driver Dirk Schoysman, who set a Nordschleife lap record in 1996 in a Nissan Skyline with a time of 7 minutes 59 seconds.  For Nissan, the new record underscored the Skyline R33 GT-R\u2019s global status as a serious sportscar, proving that Japanese brands could be as competitive as vehicles made by Germany\u2019s finest manufacturers.  The circuit opened in June 1927 to become an important battleground where legendary drivers like Tazio Nuvolari and Juan Manuel Fangio drove some of their most memorable races.  In 1935 senior Nazi officials gathered at the German Grand Prix ready to cheer the home team, only to see Italy\u2019s Nuvolari beat the Mercedes-Benz W25 and the Auto Union Typ B in an Alfa Romeo Tipo B P3.  The track remained a venue for Grand Prix races until 1976 when a horrendous crash almost killed driving ace Niki Lauda, leading to the opening of a shorter, wider Nuerburgring track with improved facilities in May 1984.  But carmakers have continued to use the older circuit\u2019s 40 right-hand and 33 left-hand turns through the Eifel region\u2019s forested hills to develop their regular vehicles.  \u201cCars cannot keep secrets here, mistakes and problems will eventually rise to the surface,\u201d Schoysman said.  At the Hatzenbach corner, cars enter a dip forcing them over a series of undulations with their suspension compressed, testing the chassis to the limit.  \u201cIf the car changes its line in that corner it may be a tire flexing, the suspension bushes that have gone through their stroke, or a problem with the stiffness of the car body, or its electronic stability program,\u201d Schoysman explained.  These development tweaks continue to be relevant for electric cars as well as for marketing purposes.  Understanding the circumstances of the test lap will be crucial for evaluating Tesla\u2019s achievement, Schoysman said.  \u201cGetting a new lap record shows the know-how of the company but there are always questions: Are the cars realistic copies of what the customer finds in a showroom? Or were they modified?\u201d","104":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (This June 4 story corrects to read Tesla, paragraphs 1,2)  (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk on Thursday called for Amazon.com Inc to be broken up, after an author complained on social media about being unable to self-publish a book via the world\u2019s largest online retailer.  \u201cThis is insane @JeffBezos,\u201d Musk tweeted at Amazon\u2019s chief. Both men are billionaires and oversee competing space exploration companies on top of their duties at Tesla and Amazon. \u201cTime to break up Amazon. Monopolies are wrong!\u201d Musk added in a second tweet.  Musk does not have legal authority to break up Amazon.  The retailer had no comment on Musk\u2019s call for its dissolution but said the book in question, by author Alex Berenson, had been blocked in error and was now available for sale via its Kindle e-reading service. The decision to greenlight the book\u2019s sale was not due to Musk, Amazon said.  The Tesla chief, who earlier this month said he would take a break from Twitter, has a history of being outspoken on the social media platform. A tweet in 2018 that he had secured funding to take Tesla private led to a lawsuit against Musk by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which the parties later settled. Musk has lashed out about shelter-at-home restrictions to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus as well.  According to a photo of a message Amazon sent Berenson, posted on Twitter, the retailer had taken action because the 22-page book did not comply with guidelines that Amazon did not specify, adding, \u201cwe are referring customers to official sources for health information about the virus.\u201d Berenson\u2019s book is titled, \u201cUnreported Truths about COVID-19 and Lockdowns: Part 1: Introduction and Death Counts and Estimates.\u201d  Berenson did not respond to an email requesting comment.

Lawyers for Tesla and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Tesla did not immediately respond to similar requests. The SEC declined to comment.  Analysts said the renewal of the public battle between Musk and the top U.S. securities regulator will be an overhang on Tesla\u2019s stock, which has lost about one-quarter of its value since peaking in August.  \u201cAnother boxing match with the SEC is the last thing investors wanted to see,\u201d wrote Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who has an \u201coutperform\u201d rating on Tesla.  He called the latest incident \u201ca wild card that could potentially bring this tornado of uncertainty back into the Tesla story until resolved.\u201d  Tesla shares closed 0.3 percent lower at $297.86 on the Nasdaq. They had fallen as much as 3.3 percent earlier.  SEC SAYS TWEETS NOT VETTED  The SEC contempt motion followed Musk\u2019s tweet to his more than 24 million Twitter followers on Feb. 19: \u201cTesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019,\u201d meaning 500,000 vehicles.  According to the SEC, Musk violated his October 2018 settlement agreement by sending that tweet without first seeking approval from Tesla\u2019s lawyers.  It also said the outlook contrasted with guidance that Tesla had given on Jan. 30 that it would deliver about 400,000 vehicles in 2019.  The settlement resolved an SEC lawsuit over another Twitter post in which Musk said he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take his Palo Alto, California-based company private at $420 per share.  Musk agreed to step down as Tesla\u2019s chairman, and both he and Tesla agreed to pay $20 million civil fines.  Four hours after his Feb. 19 tweet, Musk corrected himself, saying annualized production would probably be around 500,000 by year end, with full-year deliveries totaling 400,000.  Bradley Bondi, a lawyer for Tesla, had told the SEC in a Feb. 22 letter that Musk thought the substance of his first tweet had been \u201cappropriately vetted, pre-approved, and publicly disseminated.\u201d  POTENTIAL PUNISHMENT  It is not clear what punishment the SEC will seek.  The regulator could seek a higher fine, further restrictions on Musk\u2019s activities, or removal of him from Tesla\u2019s board.  Alternatively, it could seek to ban Musk from being a public company officer, which would force him to step down as Tesla\u2019s chief executive.  It also is not clear how Musk\u2019s public criticism of the SEC might weigh on his fate.  The criticism continued on Tuesday, when Musk tweeted in the early morning: \u201cSomething is broken with SEC oversight.\u201d  That followed his Monday night tweet, after the contempt motion was filed, that the \u201cSEC forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript, which clearly states 350k to 500k,\u201d and added: \u201cHow embarrassing.\u201d  Musk appeared to be referring to his Jan. 30 comment to analysts that Tesla would produce \u201cmaybe on the order of 350,000 to 500,000 Model 3s, something like that this year.\u201d  Criticizing the SEC is nothing new for Musk.  He has called the regulator the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission,\u201d recalling his attacks against hedge funds and other investors who sell Tesla stock short, hoping it will fall.  And in a December interview with CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Musk said he did not have respect for the SEC. He also said his tweets had not been reviewed in advance since the settlement.","106":"(Corrects timeframe of the agreement to \u201cJuly 2020 to June 2022\u201d from \u201cJuly 2020 to June 2021\u201d)  SHANGHAI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - China\u2019s top electric vehicle battery maker CATL said on Monday it has signed a battery supply agreement with Tesla.

KTVU FOX 2\/via REUTERS  Walter Huang died in a crash and vehicle fire in a Tesla Inc Model X near Mountain View, California, last month, prompting investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The agencies are also investigating the battery fire that followed the crash.  Tesla later said the car had activated Autopilot, raising new questions about the semi-autonomous system that handles some driving tasks. The company said vehicle logs from the accident showed no action had been taken by Huang before the crash and that he had received warnings to put his hands on the wheel.  The NTSB confirmed on Wednesday that it has two other pending investigations of other Tesla crashes, including a probe of an August 2017 Tesla battery fire in Lake Forest, California, that occurred after an owner lost control and ran into his garage. That fire probe had not previously been reported.  \u201cWe\u2019re really more looking at the fire aspects,\u201d NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt told Reuters, saying that the battery continued to ignite even after it was loaded onto a truck.  Tesla declined to comment on the August incident.  The NTSB previously said it also is probing an incident in which a Tesla vehicle apparently traveling in semi-autonomous mode struck a fire truck in California in January.  The law firm said its preliminary review suggested the autopilot feature was defective and had uncovered complaints by other Tesla drivers of navigational errors by the system.  \u201c(Our) preliminary review indicates that the navigation system of the Tesla may have misread the lane lines on the roadway, failed to detect the concrete median, failed to brake the car, and drove the car into the median,\u201d Minami said.  While sympathizing with the family, Tesla again blamed Huang, saying he was well aware that Autopilot was not perfect and, specifically, he had told them it was not reliable in that exact location, but nonetheless engaged Autopilot.  Tesla said the system always reminds drivers to be alert and have hands on the wheel and had warned Huang several times on the day of the crash to do so.  \u201cThe crash happened on a clear day with several hundred feet of visibility ahead, which means that the only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang was not paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so,\u201d a Tesla spokesperson told Reuters.","109":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O is in talks with authorities in Germany and the Netherlands to build its first major European factory, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing officials involved in the matter.

Tesla\u2019s future profitability hinges on ramping up its affordable sedan but the company has so far failed to meet its weekly target of 5,000 cars due to production bottlenecks.

The announcement represents the latest effort by Musk to add credibility to his proposed $72 billion deal for Tesla, following his tweet last week that funding for it was \u201csecured\u201d. That earlier tweet has triggered investor lawsuits as well as an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission into the accuracy of his statement.  Musk also posted in a blog post on Monday his most detailed vision yet into how a Tesla take-private deal could work, but shares in the car maker ended flat, indicating investor skepticism over its feasibility.  A source familiar with the matter said Silver Lake was offering its assistance to Musk in his exploration of a deal without compensation, and had not been hired as a financial adviser in an official capacity. The firm is known for putting together leveraged buyouts in the technology sector rather than providing investment banking advice.  Moreover, Silver Lake, which contributed $1.4 billion in equity to Michael Dell\u2019s deal in 2013 to take the eponymous U.S. computer maker private, is not currently discussing participating in the potential Tesla deal as an investor, the source added. Silver Lake and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.  Musk also said law firms Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Munger, Tolles & Olson would be legal advisers on the plan. Both law firms did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Musk shocked markets last week with the tweeted announcement that he was considering taking Tesla private for $420 a share. Tesla shares ended trading on Monday at $356.41.  Musk said earlier on Monday that the manager of Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund had voiced support for the company going private several times, including as recently as two weeks ago, but also said that talks continue with the fund and other investors.  \u201cI left the July 31st meeting (with the Saudi fund) with no question that a deal with the Saudi sovereign fund could be closed, and that it was just a matter of getting the process moving,\u201d Musk said.  \u201cThis is why I referred to \u2018funding secured\u2019 in the August 7th announcement.\u201d  The Saudi fund over nearly two years had approached him repeatedly about taking the company private, Musk said, and the latest meeting came after it took a nearly 5 percent stake in Tesla.  Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) manages more than $230 billion in assets, but about 65 percent of that is stakes in large Saudi companies and most of the rest has been committed in overseas deals such as funding commitments to Blackstone Group LP's BX.N U.S. infrastructure fund or SoftBank Group Corp's 9984.T Vision Fund.  The Saudi fund intends to sell its $70 billion stake in Saudi Basic Industries to oil giant Aramco, which could free up funds for new deals, but that sale may take months to conclude.  Yasir Othman al-Rumayyan, managing director of the PIF, referred Reuters to the corporate communications team, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  FUNDING QUANDARY  Musk said that since his Twitter post on the possibility of a deal the managing director of the Saudi fund had expressed support for proceeding, subject to financial and other due diligence.  PIF officials have said in the past that decisions at the sovereign wealth fund are made with care, emphasizing corporate governance. The PIF board is headed by the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

REUTERS\/Joe Skipper\/File Photo  Securities lawyers said U.S. law requires executives and companies to have a \u201creasonable basis\u201d on which to make statements, meaning the fact Musk said he believed he had secured a verbal agreement for the funding after the July 31 meeting could put him on a firmer footing with the SEC.  It remains unclear if his definition of \u201csecured\u201d matches those of a reasonable shareholder, who may believe the statement indicated Musk had a written agreement, they said.  \u201cThis supports the idea that there was reasonable basis on which to believe that funding could be secured but it doesn\u2019t eliminate the concern with respect to whether \u2018secured\u2019 was an overstatement and only underscores how inappropriate Twitter was for such a disclosure,\u201d said Zachary Fallon, a former SEC attorney and principal at law firm Blakemore Fallon.  Musk on Monday estimated two-thirds of existing Tesla shareholders would roll over their holdings into a private company, but said that he was still talking with major shareholders and advisers before settling on a structure for the deal.  Musk added that most capital for the deal would come from equity and it would not be \u201cwise\u201d to burden the company with added debt. Discussing full details on the plan, including the source and nature of the funding, would be \u201cpremature\u201d now, he said.  A major investment from Saudi Arabia would likely trigger a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which scrutinizes deals for potential national security concerns.  Jeremy Zucker, co-head of Dechert\u2019s International Trade practice, said two key determinations would be made if a deal moved forward: whether Tesla contained critical technologies and whether the involvement of Saudi financing was a national security issue.","113":"The Tesla logo is seen on a car in Los Angeles, California, U.S., July 9, 2020.

Profitability is improving at a rate where the company is on track to generate enough cash to meet its $1.7 billion debt obligations.\u201d  Tesla reported free cash flow of $881 million in the quarter - the first time since the third quarter of fiscal 2016 - and Musk said the company will maintain that in the coming quarters.  Musk has been saying since May that Tesla does not plan to raise equity or debt.  \u201cAssuming R&D spending is not delayed and Tesla is not forced to introduce a lower price (Model 3) prematurely to maintain volume, Tesla could be self-funded,\u201d Jefferies analysts wrote in a client note.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  \u201cThe Tesla investment case is about growth, not free cash generation, so we expect cash to be invested in growth and support current leverage if Tesla demonstrates sustainably positive free cash flow,\u201d they said.  The yield on Tesla\u2019s $1.8 billion high-yield bond due in August 2025 < 88160RAE1=> dropped to a two-month low as the debt rallied off the quarterly results. Since Monday, the yield on the bond, which sports a 5.3 percent coupon, has dropped more than 90 basis points to 7.49 percent from 8.40 percent.  Tesla reported profit of $311.5 million, or $1.75 per share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $619.4 million, or $3.70 per share, a year earlier.  Musk\u2019s penchant for courting controversy with his erratic tweets had put intense pressure on Tesla to convince Wall Street that the company could produce Model 3 cars in a cost-efficient manner and turn a profit.  Some analysts, however, believe Musk may be driving profits by selling only high-end, high-margin Model 3s and those profits may not be sustainable.  \u201cWe believe Tesla is exhausting its high-end backlog to fuel near-term profitability and we have concerns around demand in 1H19,\u201d UBS analyst Rajvindra Gill wrote.  Other analysts believe that Tesla has indeed turned a corner and is on a growth path.  \u201cWe believe the TSLA narrative is starting to change as the company transitions to becoming sustainably profitable,\u201d Baird Research analyst Ben Kallo said.  That was the same sentiment showed by Tesla\u2019s long-time critic and short-seller Citron Research, when it said earlier this week that it had a change of heart and is now betting the electric automaker\u2019s stock will rise.  At least three brokerages raised their price targets on the stock. Of the 29 brokerages covering the stock, 10 have a \u201cbuy\u201d or higher rating, nine on hold and 10 have a \u201csell\u201d or lower.  The median price target was $316.

The companies had yet to reach a decision on how large an order the U.S. electric car company would place, and Lishen was still working out what battery cell size Tesla would require, one of the sources said.  While Panasonic is currently Tesla\u2019s exclusive battery cell supplier, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said in November the U.S. company would manufacture all its battery modules and packs at the Shanghai factory and planned to diversify its sources.  \u201cCell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner,\u201d Musk said in a tweet in November.  Other battery makers in the running for contracts could include Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd and LG Chem Ltd.  Tesla broke ground on the $2 billion so-called Gigafactory, its first in China, earlier this month and plans to begin making Model 3 electric vehicles (EV) there by the end of the year.  Musk has said the factory will produce \u201cmore affordable\u201d vehicles for the Chinese auto market, the world\u2019s biggest, where the firm is facing mounting competition and risks from U.S.-China trade tensions.  Tesla declined to comment, while Lishen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Panasonic said in a statement it was studying various possibilities with regards to Tesla\u2019s Shanghai plant, but nothing had been decided. It declined to comment on the possibility of losing exclusive-supplier status with Tesla.  The sources declined to be identified because the discussions are private.  APPLE SUPPLIER  Lishen, which says its clients range from Apple and Samsung Electronics to Geely and Hyundai Motor, has joined other battery makers in aggressively pursuing contracts with the rapidly growing EV industry.  The Chinese company started mass production of the same type of cylindrical battery made by Panasonic for Tesla\u2019s Model 3 in 2017, in the city of Suzhou about 100 kms (60 miles) away from Shanghai.  Reuters reported on Monday that Panasonic and Toyota Motor Corp were set to launch a joint venture next year to produce EV batteries in an effort to compete with Chinese rivals.  A joint venture would build on the agreement that the pair announced in late 2017 on joint development of batteries with higher energy density in a prismatic cell arrangement.  It would also help Panasonic cut its heavy reliance on Tesla, whose production delays have weighed on the Japanese company\u2019s earnings.  Panasonic planned to shift most of its prismatic battery-related equipment and facilities in Japan and China to the joint venture, while those producing batteries for Tesla would remain under the company, a source said.

The electric carmaker, which will join the S&P 500 on Monday after rallying nearly 700% this year, ranks near the highest in implied volatility - or expectations for stock moves embedded in options prices - on the index.  Still, analysts say Tesla\u2019s shares will have a miniscule effect on broader market gyrations, based on past activity. If Tesla had been added to the S&P 500 on Thursday, it would have increased one-month implied volatility on the benchmark index by just 0.15 points, to 17.08 from 16.93, according to Susquehanna.  \u201cWe do not think it is going to have a huge impact,\u201d said Christopher Murphy, Susquehanna\u2019s co-head of derivatives strategy.  UBS strategist Stuart Kaiser concluded similarly regarding Tesla\u2019s effect on broader S&P 500 volatility in a research note distributed last month. Had the stock been included in the S&P 500 all year, it would have increased implied volatility on the benchmark index only by 0.12 points on average, he wrote.  Meanwhile, by some measures, Tesla\u2019s options have shown greater calm recently.  Tesla\u2019s 30-day implied volatility has dropped to about 82% from just below 95% last Friday, according to data from options analytics provider Trade Alert.  Exuberance among buyers of Tesla options has also faded somewhat. Tesla\u2019s skew has turned positive in the past week, according to Trade Alert, showing that speculative demand for bullish call options on the carmaker has eased up in comparison to protective put options.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Fueled by stronger-than-expected car deliveries, shares of Tesla have surged over 40% in the past seven sessions, elevating the company\u2019s market capitalization to $259 billion. More important for Musk\u2019s personal finances, Tesla\u2019s six-month average market capitalization has reached a record $138 billion.  Hitting a six-month average market capitalization of $150 billion would trigger the vesting of the second of 12 tranches of options granted to the billionaire to buy Tesla stock as part of his 2018 pay package. In early May, Musk\u2019s first tranche vested after Tesla\u2019s six-month average stock market value reached $100 billion.  (Graphic: Elon Musk's big payday, )  Musk has already achieved targets related to Tesla\u2019s financial growth that are also required in order to vest the approaching options tranche.  Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 1.69 million Tesla shares at $350.02 each. At Tesla\u2019s current stock price of $1,397, Musk would theoretically be able to sell the shares related to the tranche that vested in May and the upcoming tranche for a combined profit of over $3.5 billion, or $1.8 billion per tranche.  Musk\u2019s first tranche was worth about $700 million in May, when it vested, but its value has since increased along with Tesla\u2019s stock price.  Tesla has surged 500% over the past year as the company increased sales of its Model 3 sedan.  Tesla last week reported higher-than-expected second-quarter vehicle deliveries, defying plummeting sales in the wider auto industry as the coronavirus pandemic slammed the global economy.  The solid delivery numbers heightened expectations of a profitable second quarter, which would mark four consecutive profitable quarters, a first for Tesla, and a key hurdle to be added to the S&P 500 index.  Musk, who is also the majority owner and CEO of the SpaceX rocket maker, receives no salary, only the options in his pay package. A full payoff of all tranches would surpass anything previously granted to U.S. executives.  When Tesla unveiled Musk\u2019s pay package, it said he could theoretically reap as much as $55.8 billion if no new shares were issued. However, Tesla has since issued shares to compensate employees, and also sold shares in secondary offers, including a $2 billion stock sale in February.","124":"April 16 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc:  * TESLA INC COMMENTS ON ARTICLE PUBLISHED IN REVEAL  * TESLA INC SAYS LAST YEAR, CO REDUCED INJURY RATE BY 25% - BLOG  * TESLA INC SAYS HAVE REVIEWED AND CONFIRMED THAT THE RECORDED INJURIES REVEAL DISPUTED TO CO WERE PROPERLY RECORDED BY TESLA  * TESLA SAYS HAD UPDATED LOGS AFTER IDENTIFYING SOME WORK HOURS & INJURIES NOT SHARED WITH CO BY TEMP AGENCIES PRIOR TO 2016 OSHA 300 LOGS SUBMISSION Source text : (bit.ly\/2JPuSiV) Further company coverage:","125":"TOKYO, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Tesla and Panasonic are ending their partnership to produce solar cells, the Nikkei reported on Wednesday, as the Japanese electronics company ramps up efforts to divest unprofitable businesses.

His tweet came hours after a federal judge ordered him and the regulator to justify their settlement.  \u201cJust want to (sic) that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work,\u201d Musk, a frequent critic of investors betting against the electric car company said in the tweet. \u201cAnd the name change is so on point!\u201d  In its quarterly letter, Greenlight said on Friday its short position on Tesla was its second-biggest winner in the third quarter.

Tesla shares plunged last week after the SEC accused Musk, 47, of fraud over \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d tweets on Aug. 7 that promised to take Tesla private and said funding had been secured.  The lawsuit threatened Tesla and Musk with a long fight that could have undermined the company\u2019s operations and ability to raise capital.

Battery cells are central to Panasonic\u2019s plan to nearly double automotive business revenue to 2.5 trillion yen by the year through March 2022 as it shifts away from low profit margin consumer electronics.  The company said it expects battery cell sales to drive operating profit up 11.7 percent to 425 billion yen ($3.87 billion) in the year through March 2019.  The outlook was in line with the 429.76 billion yen average of 19 analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters. However, it was below Panasonic\u2019s 450 billion yen target set three years ago, with the company blaming a stronger yen that reduces the value of profit earned overseas.  Panasonic expects profit at its automotive energy business, which includes battery cells, to more than double after production delays in Tesla\u2019s mass-market Model 3 car pressured profit in the previous year.  Tesla earlier this month promised to meet its production target of 5,000 Model 3 cars per week by the end of June.

Recent weak economic data has increased pressure on lawmakers to reach a deal.  \u201cInvestors definitely want to see something come through or like to see something come through on the stimulus front sooner rather than later as COVID cases continue to rise and economic data has shown that it is beginning to deteriorate,\u201d Bell said.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 215.51 points, or 0.71%, to 30,087.86, the S&P 500 lost 27.36 points, or 0.73%, to 3,695.12 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 38.87 points, or 0.3%, to 12,725.88.  Trading could become more volatile heading into the close.  \u201cThere\u2019s a ton more volume, but I don\u2019t necessarily think it has a real directional basis,\u201d said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group. \u201cEveryone really wanted a stimulus package by the end of today. If we\u2019re not going to get it, the market is going to be down. That\u2019s going to trump anything related to quad witching.\u201d  The prospect of continued monetary and fiscal stimulus has helped stocks look past the economic impact of the pandemic, and set them up for strong annual gains, despite a rocky start to the year.  FedEx Corp fell 5.3% after it did not give an earnings forecast for 2021, even as its quarterly profit almost doubled.  Rival United Parcel Service Inc\u2019s shares also dipped. Microsoft Corp was down 1.2% after it said it found malicious software in its systems related to a massive hacking campaign disclosed by U.S. officials this week.  Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.41-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.11-to-1 ratio favored advancers.  The S&P 500 posted 32 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 280 new highs and 7 new lows.

Tesla shares were up 3.2% in trading before the bell, building on a 12.5% jump in the past two days in one of the most volatile weeks this year for technology-related stocks on Wall Street.  The carmaker\u2019s dizzying 500% surge this year has come courtesy of improved headline results and a flood of money into technology-linked shares, but Wall Street analysts are still less convinced about the company\u2019s longer-term prospects.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Tesla plans to resolve logistics issues with global vehicle deliveries after weathering a challenging few months, also marked by staff layoffs and a public spat between Musk and U.S. financial regulators.  Shares of Tesla, which are down 22 percent this year, were about flat after the results, which came more than an hour after they were expected.  Musk is still battling to convince investors that demand for the Model 3, the sedan hoped to propel Tesla to sustainable profit, is \u201cinsanely\u201d high, and that it can be delivered efficiently and swiftly to customers around the world. Lower deliveries had added to worries over Tesla\u2019s cash situation and increased speculation a capital raise was coming soon.  On a call following results, Musk also stepped back from an earlier prediction that the company\u2019s Shanghai factory, which is currently being built, would likely produce 3,000 Model 3s per week by year\u2019s end. Instead, the so-called Gigafactory would build 1,000, or maybe 2,000 per week by the end of the year, he said.  Many analysts had predicted the company would need to raise funds for its expansion, including the Shanghai factory, the upcoming Model Y SUV, and other projects. Tesla said it ended its first quarter with $2.2 billion in cash after paying off a $920 million convertible bond obligation in March. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/2XJ3Rnd)  \u201cThere is some merit to raising capital,\u201d responded Musk, after being asked why he had not done so yet. \u201cIt\u2019s probably about the right time.\u201d  The company stood by its 2019 delivery forecast of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles and said it may produce as many as 500,000 vehicles if its China factory reaches volume production in the fourth quarter.  Tesla said a loss in its second quarter would be \u201csignificantly\u201d less than the $702 million lost in the first quarter. Profit would return in the third quarter, Tesla said.  Haris Anwar, senior analyst a financial markets platform Investing.com, called guidance for the second quarter \u201cbleak\u201d. \u201cI continue to see a very volatile 2019 for Tesla and its shares,\u201d Anwar said.  TOPSY-TURVY QUARTER  Tesla\u2019s results came two days after the company hosted a self-driving event, in which Musk predicted Tesla would have over a million autonomous vehicles by next year. Some analysts perceived the presentation as a way to deflect attention from questions about demand, margin pressure, increasing competition and even Musk\u2019s ongoing battle with U.S. regulators.  On Thursday, Musk and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are expected to tell a federal judge the status of discussions to resolve their dispute over Musk\u2019s Twitter use.  Heightening uncertainty during the quarter were logistics bottlenecks at international ports, price adjustments on vehicles and a surprise announcement, later reversed, to close most of Tesla\u2019s stores in order to financially offset the introduction of the $35,000 Model 3.  On Wednesday, Tesla said it planned to deliver 90,000 to 100,000 vehicles to customers in the second quarter, versus 63,000 vehicles in the first.  Musk said that Tesla would change the costly and inefficient way it was building cars, in which it produced for international markets at the start of each quarter - to leave time for longer transport - then built for North America later. A better production blend would be less taxing on the company, Musk said.  The gross profit margin on the Model 3 - a focus for investors - remained relatively steady at 20 percent.  Tesla also announced it would start offering its own insurance product in about a month to better reflect the safety of its vehicles.  Tesla reported net loss attributable to common shareholders of $702.1 million, or $4.10 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a loss of $709.6 million, or $4.19 per share, a year earlier.  Excluding some items, Tesla lost $1.77 per share, compared with Wall Street expectations of a loss of 69 cents, according to data from Refinitiv.  Shares fell less than a percent to $258 in after-hours trade.

The legal complaint on behalf of 14 families from Congo was filed on Sunday by International Rights Advocates, a U.S.-based human rights non-profit, against Tesla Inc, Apple Inc, Alphabet Inc, Microsoft Corp and Dell Technologies Inc..  The companies were part of a system of forced labor that the families claimed led to the death and serious injury of their children, it said.  It marked the first time the tech industry jointly has faced legal action over the source of its cobalt.  Images in the court documents, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington D.C., showed children with disfigured or missing limbs.  Six of the 14 children in the case were killed in tunnel collapses, and the others suffered life-altering injuries, including paralysis, it said.  \u201cThese companies - the richest companies in the world, these fancy gadget-making companies - have allowed children to be maimed and killed to get their cheap cobalt,\u201d Terrence Collingsworth, an attorney representing the families, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Cobalt is essential in making rechargeable lithium batteries used in millions of products sold by the tech industry.  More than half of the world\u2019s cobalt is produced in Congo.  Global demand for the metal is expected to increase at 7% to 13% annually over the next decade, according to a 2018 study by the European Commission.  The lawsuit said the children, some as young as 6 years old, were forced by their families\u2019 extreme poverty to leave school and work in cobalt mining owned by the British mining company Glencore. Glencore has previously been accused of using child labor.  Some children were paid as little as $1.50 per day, working 6 days a week, it said.  In response to a request for comment, Dell said in an email that it has \u201cnever knowingly sourced operations\u201d using child labor and has launched an investigation into the allegations.  A spokesperson for Glencore said: \u201cGlencore notes the allegations contained in a U.S. lawsuit filed on 15th December 2019.  \u201cGlencore\u2019s production of cobalt in the DRC is a by-product of our industrial copper production. Glencore\u2019s operations in the DRC do not purchase or process any artisanally mined ore.  \u201cGlencore does not tolerate any form of child, forced, or compulsory labor.\u201d  Tesla, Apple, Google, Microsoft did not immediately respond for comment.  The legal complaint argued that the companies all have the ability to overhaul their cobalt supply chains to ensure safer conditions.  \u201cI\u2019ve never encountered or documented a more severe asymmetry in the allocation of income between the top of the supply chain and the bottom,\u201d said Siddharth Kara, a researcher on modern slavery who is an expert witness in the case.  \u201cIt\u2019s that disconnect that makes this perhaps the worst injustice of slavery and child exploitation that I\u2019ve seen in my two decades research,\u201d Kara said.  More than 40 million people have been estimated to be captive in modern slavery, which includes forced labor and forced marriage, according to Walk Free and the International Labour Organization.","140":"FILE PHOTO: A Tesla logo is painted on a wall inside of a Tesla dealership in New York, U.S., April 29, 2016.

The wealth surge of America\u2019s richest men happened during a period that saw as many as 22 million Americans file for unemployment.  Even as the broader economy faced a recession, tech and stay-at-home stocks like Zoom ZM.O have rallied in recent weeks, due to a surge in usage of video conferencing and remote work technology, thus boosting the net worth of billionaire founders with holdings in those companies.  \u201cThis is the tale of two pandemics, with very unequal sacrifice,\u201d said Chuck Collins, a co-author of the report.

REUTERS\/Joe Skipper\/File Photo  Tesla has been struggling to ramp up production of its new Model 3 sedan, which is crucial to the company\u2019s long-term profitability. In April, Tesla said it was making 2,270 vehicles a week, less than half the promised 5,000 a week it said it would meet by the end of June.  Manufacturing bottlenecks have delayed the delivery of vehicles to customers and deferred much-needed revenue as the company continues to spend heavily on Model 3 production fixes, as well as projects in the pipeline.  The company has been engaging in so-called \u201cburst builds,\u201d temporary periods of fast-as-possible production which it uses to estimate how many cars it is capable of building over longer periods of time.  Analyst Brian Johnson of Barclays warned investors in March to be wary, however, of brief \u201cburst rates\u201d of Model 3 production that were not sustainable.  Musk has also come under fire for his behavior during an earnings conference call last month, in which he cut off analysts posing financial queries, rejecting them as \u201cboring, bonehead questions.\u201d Shares fell as much as 7 percent after Musk\u2019s snub, evaporating $2 billion from Tesla\u2019s stock market value.  He repeated his assertion that the company was not planning on raising additional debt or equity, without providing a timeframe, and said he expected positive net income and cash flow in the third and fourth quarters.  Musk and another executive told investors that an announcement about a factory in Shanghai would come soon and talks were underway with the Chinese government.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  Arguing that the sprawling company has become difficult to oversee, one investor proposed splitting the chairman and chief executive jobs, both of which Musk holds. Musk owns a 20 percent stake in the company.  Union-affiliated investment adviser CtW Investment Group had rallied shareholders to reject three Tesla directors it says lack qualifications or independence, including investor Antonio Gracias, Tesla\u2019s lead independent director; James Murdoch, the CEO of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc; and sustainable food executive Kimbal Musk, Elon Musk\u2019s brother.  Proxy firms Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and activist investor CtW Investment Group had supported separating the chairman and CEO roles and mostly opposed the three directors, the only ones up for election this year.

At a hearing in Manhattan federal court, U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan gave both sides two weeks to work out their differences, and said she could rule on whether Musk violated his recent fraud settlement with the regulator if they failed.  \u201cTake a deep breath, put your reasonableness pants on, and work this out,\u201d the judge said.  The hearing appeared to lift an overhang over Tesla, as the SEC stopped well short of recommending Musk\u2019s removal as chief executive or even from the electric car company\u2019s board.  Instead, the regulator suggested that greater oversight of Musk\u2019s communications, including the threat of new fines if he backslides, was punishment enough, at least for now.  \u201cWhat this is to the SEC is strike two, and if there is another transgression they might seek a director and officer bar,\u201d said Peter Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit and a former SEC lawyer. \u201cThey are just trying to send a message: be more careful.\u201d  Nathan had been asked to hold Musk in contempt over a Feb. 19 tweet, where the SEC said he improperly posted material information about Tesla\u2019s vehicle production outlook without first seeking approval from its lawyers.  The SEC said pre-approval was a core element of the October 2018 settlement, which resolved a lawsuit over a tweet last Aug. 7 where Musk said he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private at $420 per share.  That settlement called for Musk to step down as Tesla\u2019s chairman, and levied $20 million civil fines each on Musk and the Palo Alto, California-based company.  Musk declined to discuss the hearing as he left the courthouse, surrounded by a horde of reporters, photographers and television cameras, but said \u201cI feel very loved here.\u201d  In a statement provided later by Tesla, Musk said: \u201cI have great respect for Judge Nathan, and I\u2019m pleased with her decision today. The tweet in question was true, immaterial to shareholders, and in no way a violation of my agreement.\u201d  TESLA ALSO FAULTED  Tesla\u2019s share price tumbled 8.2% on Thursday, after the company on Wednesday night reported lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries, but recouped some early losses once Musk\u2019s job no longer appeared imperiled.  The company built its reputation on luxury cars, but has faced several production challenges with its Model 3 sedan, which it hopes will reach a mass audience.  \u201cElon Musk was very well composed in the court today, which means he\u2019s taking it seriously,\u201d Craig Irwin, a Roth Capital Partners analyst who attended the hearing, said in an interview. He called Nathan\u2019s order \u201ca good outcome for Tesla investors.\u201d Irwin rates Tesla \u201cneutral.\u201d  The battle concerned a tweet that Musk sent to his more than 24 million Twitter followers: \u201cTesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019,\u201d meaning 500,000 vehicles.  Four hours later, Musk corrected himself, saying annualized production would be \u201cprobably around\u201d 500,000 by year end, with full-year deliveries totaling about 400,000.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  The SEC said the earlier tweet conflicted with Tesla\u2019s Jan. 30 outlook, when it targeted annualized Model 3 production exceeding 500,000 as soon as the fourth quarter, and projected 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries this year.  Musk\u2019s lawyers countered that the earlier tweet contained nothing new, and that the SEC had conceded during settlement talks that Musk did not need pre-approval for all tweets about Tesla.  RESPECT FOR JUSTICE SYSTEM  At the hearing, SEC lawyer Cheryl Crumpton said a contempt finding could require Musk to file regular reports about how Tesla lawyers are overseeing his tweets.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  Noting that Musk had called his $20 million fine \u201cworth it,\u201d Crumpton said the threat of higher potential fines might also be needed to show that further violations would be \u201cnot worth it.\u201d  Musk is worth $20.7 billion, according to Forbes magazine.  Crumpton also faulted what she called Tesla\u2019s \u201ctroubling\u201d conduct. \u201cTesla still appears to be unwilling to exercise any meaningful control over the conduct of its CEO,\u201d she said.  Tesla was not accused of contempt.  Musk\u2019s lawyer, John Hueston, countered that the \u201cambiguity\u201d of the settlement made \u201cthe hard penalty of contempt\u201d unfair.  The \u201cfunding secured\u201d tweet had sent Tesla\u2019s share price up as much as 13.3 percent. Musk\u2019s privatization plan was at best in an early stage, however, and financing was not in place.  SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has said he does not favor draconian penalties that could harm investors, saying when Musk settled that \u201cthe skills and support of certain individuals may be important to the future success of a company.\u201d  Musk remains an outspoken critic of the SEC.  Since the case began, he has dubbed the regulator the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission,\u201d recalling his attacks on investors who sell Tesla stock short.  And in the early morning of Feb. 26, after the SEC filed its contempt motion, Musk tweeted: \u201cSomething is broken with SEC oversight.\u201d  As he prepared to enter the courthouse, Musk told reporters: \u201cI have a great respect for the justice system.\u201d  Asked whether he also respected the SEC, Musk laughed, before turning to go inside.","146":"DETROIT\/TOKYO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's TSLA.O launch of its futuristic Cybertruck pickup suffered a setback when its \"armored glass\" windows shattered, but it was the overall look of the electric vehicle that worried Wall Street on Friday, driving the automaker's shares down 6%.  In the much-anticipated unveiling to cheering fans late on Thursday, Tesla boss Elon Musk had taken aim at the design, power and durability of mainstream trucks, only to be shaken when his boast about his new vehicle\u2019s windows backfired.  \u201cOh my fucking God, well, maybe that was a little too hard,\u201d Musk said, after his head of design, Franz von Holzhausen, cracked the driver\u2019s side window with a metal ball in a series of tests for the crowd at the event in Los Angeles.  He allowed von Holzhausen another throw to the rear passenger window, only to see that crack as well.  \u201cIt didn\u2019t go through, so that\u2019s a plus side,\u201d Musk said, adding: \u201cRoom for improvement.\u201d  Musk singled out the Ford F.N F-150, the top-selling vehicle in the United States, to highlight the capabilities of the Cybertruck, showing an edited video of the two trucks in a back-to-back \"tug-of-war\" in which the Tesla truck wins.  Some Wall Street analysts praised the launch on Friday, but others doubted the futuristic design\u2019s mass appeal. Tesla shares were down 6% at $333.41.  Shares of Ford and General Motors rose about 2%. General Motors\u2019 first electric pickup will go on sale in 2021, around the same time as Tesla\u2019s, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra told investors on Thursday.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  \u201cMusk has been enthusiastic about his Blade Runner-inspired design for months, but we were still surprised how futuristic he went with this one and believe it may shatter his dreams,\u201d Cowen analysts wrote in a note.  \u201cWhile we are pleased to see Tesla enter the most profitable segment of the North American passenger car market, we do not see this vehicle in its current form being a success.\u201d  The U.S. pickup truck market is one of the world's most profitable vehicle segments and is dominated by Ford, General Motors Co GM.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) FCHA.MIFCAU.N.  Pickup buyers are fiercely brand loyal and are viewed as traditional in their choice of vehicle.  JP Miller, CEO of Paul Miller Ford in Lexington, Kentucky, sells an average of 100 new Fords a month, around 40% of which are pickup trucks. Many of them are work trucks, and Miller said when watching Tesla\u2019s unveiling on Thursday night he could not see any of his customers wanting a Cybertruck.  \u201cI have to say, I was a little confused,\u201d Miller said. \u201cPickup trucks are critical for building America and I couldn\u2019t see how that could apply to Tesla\u2019s truck.\u201d  Friday\u2019s selloff dented a 40% rally in Tesla\u2019s shares that was sparked after Musk reported an unexpected quarterly profit on Oct. 23. That stock surge scalded traders betting Tesla will fail to survive an eventual wave of electric vehicles made by more established automakers.  But even after traders recently cut their short bets against Tesla to 22% of its float from over 30% in August, its stock remains one of the most shorted on Wall Street, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.

FILE PHOTO: Flags fly over the Tesla Inc. Gigafactory 2, also known as RiverBend, a joint venture with Panasonic to produce solar panels and roof tiles in Buffalo, New York, U.S., August 2, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  The exporting underscores the depth of Tesla\u2019s troubles in the U.S. solar business, which the electric car maker entered in 2016 with its controversial $2.6 billion purchase of SolarCity.  Tesla has only sporadically purchased solar cells produced by its partner in the factory, Panasonic Corp, according to a Buffalo solar factory employee speaking on condition of anonymity. The rest are going largely to foreign buyers, according to a Panasonic letter to U.S. Customs officials reviewed by Reuters.  When the two firms announced the partnership in 2016, the companies said they would collaborate on cell and module production and Tesla would make a long-term commitment to buy the cells from Panasonic. Cells are components that convert the sun\u2019s light into electricity; they are combined to make solar panels.  Tesla planned to use them in its Solar Roof, a system meant to look like normal roof tiles. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk billed the product as a cornerstone of the strategy behind the acquisition - selling a low-carbon lifestyle to eco-conscious consumers who could use the power from their Solar Roof to charge their Tesla electric vehicle.  But the company has installed them on just a handful of rooftops nationwide so far after production line troubles and a gutting of Tesla\u2019s solar sales team.  California state data shows 21 Solar Roof systems were connected by the state\u2019s three investor-owned utilities as of Feb. 28. Only a few others were connected in the northeastern United States, according to a former Tesla employee with knowledge of the matter, who was laid off during staff cuts earlier this year and asked not to be named.  Tesla declined to comment on the company\u2019s purchases of cells from Panasonic and would not provide figures for Solar Roof installations. But a company official said in an email \u201cthe number of solar roofs you cite in the story is low and unrepresentative as we are actively installing the Solar Roof in eight states currently.\u201d  The situation raises new questions about the viability of cash-strapped Tesla\u2019s solar business. Musk once called the deal a \u201cno brainer\u201d - but some investors panned it as a bailout of an affiliated firm at the expense of Tesla shareholders. Before the merger, Musk had served as chairman of SolarCity\u2019s board of directors, and his cousin, Lyndon Rive, was the company\u2019s CEO.  Panasonic spokesman Alberto Canal declined to comment on the company\u2019s sales to Tesla, but confirmed that Panasonic was seeking to use its Buffalo operations to fulfill demand for U.S.-made solar cells from foreign buyers.  Panasonic had said in a filing with the U.S. Department of Commerce in October 2018 that foreign demand for U.S.-made solar cells had sprung up after the Trump Administration imposed tariffs on overseas-made panels in 2018.  Panasonic also produces traditional solar panels at the Buffalo plant for Tesla, but has been selling many of them to other buyers since at least last year due to low demand from the California car company, Reuters reported in August 2018. Tesla last month reported a 36 percent slide in its overall solar sales in the first quarter, adding to previous big drops since the SolarCity acquisition.  Since Tesla purchased SolarCity in the fourth quarter of 2016, installations have dropped more than 76 percent, according to company financial disclosures.  After gutting its solar sales team and ending its retail relationship with Home Depot, Tesla last month announced a plan to counter the downward spiral by offering cut-rate prices on standardized rooftop systems and requiring would-be customers to order solar products online.  Panasonic\u2019s move to diversify its solar customers is the latest sign of the company falling out of step with its longtime partner. Panasonic is Tesla\u2019s sole battery supplier for its electric car business, but Musk last month blamed Panasonic for EV production delays. He has also said Tesla was looking for more battery suppliers for its new Shanghai car factory.  SEPARATE OPERATIONS  Panasonic\u2019s letter to U.S. officials last October accompanied a request to produce the cells in a foreign trade zone within the Buffalo plant that would allow Panasonic to import certain parts tariff-free because the finished cells would be sold overseas, not domestically.  That request was granted in April.  The zones help companies avoid, delay or pay reduced tariffs on imported parts in cases where it helps U.S. manufacturers compete with overseas rivals.  \u201cIt is fully anticipated that the majority of the cells to be produced\u201d in the FTZ \u201cwill be exported,\u201d the company said in its application.  Panasonic\u2019s Canal said foreign solar panel manufacturers want the Buffalo plant\u2019s cells because solar panels assembled abroad with American-made cells can be shipped to the United States tariff-free, according to U.S. trade rules implemented last fall.  Panasonic\u2019s Buffalo operation is one of few U.S.-based solar cell producers because it is traditionally far cheaper to make the components in other countries, putting it in a unique position to serve the foreign demand.  Canal would not disclose the company\u2019s non-Tesla solar cell customers or say what percentage of its Buffalo cell output was being shipped outside the country, saying that information was \u201cproprietary and competitive.\u201d  A Panasonic source said much of the exported material was going to a large Asian buyer.  Tesla inherited the factory, known as RiverBend, through its purchase of SolarCity, and is now required to deliver on investment and employment promises that SolarCity had made in exchange for $750 million in state subsidies.  The factory employs about 800 workers, and by this time next year it will be required to have 1,460 employees or pay millions in penalties.  The state of New York remains pleased with its investment in the factory and Panasonic\u2019s move to diversify its customer base beyond Tesla.  \u201cWe have two of the leading clean energy companies in the world in Buffalo at the RiverBend facility,\u201d Pamm Lent, spokeswoman for Empire State Development, said in a statement. \u201cTesla produces their innovative solar roof tiles \u200elargely for development and testing with the goal of full scale launch in the future. Panasonic is now the largest producer and employer at RiverBend with a customer base independent of Tesla.\u201d  Today, the companies operate separately at the Buffalo factory, according to one current and one former Panasonic employee.  \u201cEverybody wants Tesla to succeed,\u201d the employee said, \u201cbut we are operating completely independently from them right now.\u201d","158":"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O has registered a new electric car firm in Shanghai, as China prepares to scrap rules on capping foreign ownership of new-energy vehicle (NEV) ventures.

The new company, registered in south-east Shanghai within the city\u2019s free-trade zone area lists Tesla China head Zhu Xiaotong as its legal representative, and Tesla Motors HK Limited as the sole shareholder in the firm.  Tesla currently imports all the cars it sells in China from the United States. It has other wholly-owned firms registered in China focused on sales and research and development.  China has said it will scrap limits on foreign ownership of NEV ventures this year and all automotive ventures by 2022, a major policy shift in the world\u2019s top car market that has capped foreign ownership at 50 percent for over two decades.  U.S. firms have also been caught up in the crossfire of a bruising trade dispute between the two countries, although there are signs of a thaw in relations ahead of a second round of trade talks in Washington later this week.  Analysts have said the main beneficiaries of looser ownership rules would be NEV makers like Tesla, which has been keen to maintain control of its own plant and protect its technology rather than cede a 50 percent share.  Tesla boss Elon Musk has previously criticized China\u2019s tough auto rules for foreign businesses, saying they created an uneven playing field. However, earlier this month he said the firm could soon unveil the location of a Chinese gigafactory.","159":"April 29 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Wednesday beat analysts\u2019 estimates for first-quarter revenue, as the electric carmaker reported a solid number of deliveries during the period despite disruptions due to the coronavirus outbreak.

The change meant 38.7 percent of analysts now have a sell rating on Tesla, topping the previous record of 36.8 percent in November, 2016.  REPUTATION IN CHINA  The latest fire incident comes as Tesla tries to push sales in China, where its prices were impacted by tit-for-tat tariffs imposed during Sino-U.S. trade tensions last year.  The automaker currently imports all the cars it sells in China, but is building a factory in Shanghai that will initially make its Model 3 and help reduce the hit of a trade war.  In March, Tesla was also on the receiving end of a labeling mix-up at Shanghai customs that led to a temporary suspension of clearance for a batch of Model 3 cars.  Analysts said the latest fire incident would likely increase attention on the safety of EVs, but was unlikely to have a significant impact on Tesla\u2019s sales or reputation in China while the cause was being investigated.  \u201cTesla had fire incidents before, but they didn\u2019t have a big impact on its reputation in China,\u201d said analyst Alan Kang at LMC Automotive.  \u201cSince its consumer base is not particularly conservative, and China is pushing the electric vehicle market, if this incident is just accidental, it will not have a big impact on Tesla,\u201d he said.  \u201cTesla self-ignites\u201d was one of the most popular hashtags on Weibo on Monday, racking up over 20 million clicks. Some users urged the automaker to quickly find the cause, whereas others speculated over the impact to the value of Tesla cars currently on the road.

Showroom strength is becoming an important differentiator for electric vehicle (EV) makers in the world\u2019s biggest auto and EV market, as they line up new model launches.  Polestar, which plans to deliver Polestar 2 electric sedans in China from July, currently has one showroom, in the capital Beijing. It plans to have 20 showrooms, with most of them opening in the third quarter of this year.  Unlike sales of cars through dealers that most traditional automakers rely on, Polestar will sell directly to customers, a strategy also pursued by other EV makers including Tesla, Nio Inc NIO.N and Xpeng Motors, backed by Alibaba BABA.N.  Direct sales to customers can help automakers to better manage a car\u2019s retail price and its production and inventory. However, it also adds to costs if automakers need to invest in self-owned showrooms like Tesla.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Polestar, however, will partner with investors to build and operate the showrooms while still managing sales and delivery of cars, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the plan is not public.  A Polestar representative declined to comment.  The automaker, based in Gothenburg, Sweden, started producing Polestar 2 sedans earlier this year in China and will also export them to Europe and the United States.  It will open showrooms firstly in Shanghai and then expand to coastal Ningbo, northern Tianjin and southern Guangzhou. The showrooms will be mostly in shopping malls.  In China, Tesla has over 50 showrooms. Nio currently operates around 110 showrooms, with some of the properties belonging to partners. Xpeng plans to have over 200 outlets by the end of the year from about 150 now, many of them belonging to partners.","164":"WASHINGTON, June 13 (Reuters) - The Trump administration has denied requests to exempt Tesla Inc\u2019s Model 3 from 25% tariffs on its Chinese-made car computer and center screen, according to letters seen by Reuters.

The subsequent share drop erased around $13 billion from Tesla\u2019s market value and nearly $3 billion from the value of Musk\u2019s stake. Still, shares remain up almost 50% from the start of April.  More than two hours after the tweets began, Tesla had not responded to requests for comment. Twitter declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk had responded to an email asking whether he was joking or whether his tweet was vetted by saying, \u201cNo\u201d.  Musk has a history of sending provocative tweets. In August 2018, he tweeted that he had secured funding to possibly take Tesla private at a big premium, which led a fraud case by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Musk settled by agreeing to pay $20 million and have a Tesla lawyer pre-screen tweets with important information about the company.  Last month, a federal judge said Tesla and Musk must face a lawsuit by shareholders over the going-private tweet, including a claim that Musk intended to defraud them.  In April 2019 Musk tweeted, \u201cMy Twitter is pretty much complete nonsense at this point.\u201d  \u201cWe view these Musk comments as tongue in cheek and it\u2019s Elon being Elon. It\u2019s certainty a headache for investors for him to venture into this area as his tweeting remains a hot button issue and the Street clearly is frustrated,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said by email.  Tesla\u2019s stock has surged in recent weeks, but is down since Wednesday after the company reported an unexpected quarterly profit, despite manufacturing interruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic.  Musk\u2019s latest tweets follow others this week. On Tesla\u2019s quarterly conference call on Wednesday, he called sweeping U.S. stay-at-home restrictions to curtail the coronavirus outbreak \u201cfascist\u201d. Those restrictions have forced Tesla to shutter its car plant in Fremont, California.  \u201cMusk has recently expressed some strong and, at times, controversial, views on COVID-19 and some elements of the response to the crisis and we believe is attempting to use his broad following and visibility to bring attention to some economic factors that he believes may be overlooked,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a client note on Friday.  Musk\u2019s iconoclastic stance has helped him attract over 33 million followers on Twitter and is seen as a marketing boon for Tesla.  Tesla\u2019s recent rally has put Musk on the verge of a payday of over $700 million. The six-month average of Tesla\u2019s market capitalization is just short of $100 billion, a target that would trigger the vesting of a tranche of options granted to Musk to buy 1.69 million shares as part of his two-year-old pay package.","166":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla Inc expects global shortages of nickel, copper and other electric-vehicle battery minerals down the road due to underinvestment in the mining sector, the company\u2019s global supply manager for battery metals told an industry conference on Thursday, according to two sources.  FILE PHOTO: A Tesla car is seen in Santa Monica, California, United States, October 23, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  The company, a major minerals consumer, has rarely talked publicly about its views on the metals industry. Copper, nickel, lithium and related minerals are key components used to make electric-vehicle batteries and other parts.  Sarah Maryssael, Tesla\u2019s global supply manager for battery metals, told a closed-door Washington conference of miners, regulators and lawmakers that the automaker sees a shortage of key EV minerals coming, according to the sources.  According to a Tesla spokesman, the comments were industry-specific and referring to the long-term supply challenges that may occur with regards to these metals.  The copper industry has suffered from years of underinvestment, and it is now working feverishly to develop new mines and bring fresh supply online as the electrification trend envelops the global economy. Freeport-McMoRan Inc, the world\u2019s largest publicly traded copper producer, is expanding in the United States and Indonesia.  Electric cars use twice as much copper as internal combustion engines. So-called smart-home systems - such as Alphabet Inc\u2019s Nest thermostat and Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Alexa personal assistant - will consume about 1.5 million tonnes of copper by 2030, up from 38,000 tonnes today, according to data from consultancy BSRIA.  All that will make the red metal - and other minerals - scarcer commodities, which worries Tesla.  Maryssael added, according to the sources, that Tesla will continue to focus more on nickel, part of a plan by Chief Executive Elon Musk to use less cobalt in battery cathodes. Cobalt is primarily mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and some extraction techniques - especially those using child labor - have made its use deeply unpopular across the battery industry, especially with Musk.  Maryssael told the conference, hosted by commodity pricing tracker Benchmark Minerals Intelligence, that there is \u201chuge potential\u201d to partner with mines in Australia or the United States, according to the sources.  Australia late last year signed a preliminary deal with the United States to support joint research and development of minerals deemed critical to the U.S. economy.  The conference, attended by more than 100 people, featured speakers from the U.S. Department of State and Department of Energy, as well as Standard Lithium Ltd, ioneer Ltd and other companies working to develop U.S. lithium mines.","167":"(Corrects day of week options exercised in sixth paragraph)  SAN FRANCISCO, May 22 (Reuters) - Shares of Tesla fell for a sixth straight session on Wednesday after Citi cut its price target on the struggling electric car maker, leaving buyers of its recent share offer, including Chief Executive Elon Musk, $167 million in the hole.  Tesla\u2019s stock dropped 4.3% to $196.10, on track to close below $200 for the first time since late 2016. It has tumbled 20% since the company sold a $1.84 billion convertible bond and almost $900 million of stock on May 2 to raise fresh capital and give it more time to stop losing money.  Citi analyst Itay Michaeli, who has a \u201csell\u201d rating on Tesla, cut his price target to $191 from $238. He pointed to a an email Musk sent to employees last week, telling them he would increase cost-cutting, and that the $2.7 billion in recently raised capital would give Tesla just 10 months to break even at the rate it burned cash in the first quarter.  \u201cThe recent reported internal memo, which seemingly called into question prior guidance, didn\u2019t help the risk\/reward calculus. The implications can be serious, since an automaker\u2019s balance sheet is always subject to the confidence \u2018spiral\u2019 risk,\u201d Michaeli wrote in a client note.  Musk is battling to convince investors that demand remains high for the Model 3, the sedan targeted to propel Tesla to sustainable profit, and that it can be delivered efficiently and swiftly to customers around the world. Tesla lost $702 million in the first quarter and warned that profit would be delayed until the latter half of the year.  Musk on Monday exercised options to buy 175,000 Tesla shares at $31.17 per share, increasing his indirect stake in the company to 34,102,560 shares, according to a filing. With Tesla\u2019s stock down 41% year to date, Musk\u2019s shares, including 102,880 he bought in this month\u2019s capital raise, were worth $6.7 billion on Wednesday.  Tesla\u2019s debt has stalled at lows hit earlier this week. Its recently issued convertible bond due in 2024 priced at 89.09 cents on the dollar, a record low. Its $1.8 billion junk bond traded at 82.5 cents on the dollar, slightly up from the all-time lows it hit on Monday and Tuesday.  The cost to insure Tesla\u2019s debt, as measured by its credit default swap, edged up to roughly 28% of the face value of Tesla\u2019s 2025 bond, from 27.6 % the day before.

There will undoubtedly be no shortage of candidates, given that plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have been publicly asserting billion-dollar exposure for Tesla.  But that\u2019s not the only looming lead counsel fight for big names in the plaintiffs\u2019 bar. Last week, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered the consolidation of at least nine (and as many as 15) prospective antitrust class actions alleging that companies in control of local television stations \u2013 notably, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Tribune Media and Hearst Television, among others \u2013 have conspired to rig ad sale rates in markets across the country. The multidistrict litigation is now before U.S. District Judge Virginia Kendall of Chicago.  Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.  The alleged conspiracy, as the JPML described it in the consolidation order, has been underway since at least 2016 and possibly since 2014. According to the complaints, defendants shared information about ad rates through their ad sales teams and via trade associations in order to peg prices at supracompetitive rates. Last July, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Justice Department conducted an antitrust investigation of local television ad sales following its rejection of a merger between Tribune and Sinclair.  The defendants are taking litigation seriously enough to have engaged an expensive array of big firms to represent them: Shearman & Sterling for Sinclair, Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison for Tribune, Cravath Swaine & Moore for Hearst, Kirkland & Ellis for Nexstar Media, Jenner & Block for TEGNA and Cooley for Gray Television.  The plaintiffs, meanwhile, are for the most part small businesses like personal injury law firms, car dealerships and an ad agency. On Friday, after the MDL was established, the national department store Bon-Ton filed a complaint in federal court in Chicago that will be part of the case. According to Bon-Ton lawyer Adam Levitt of DiCello Levitt & Casey (who\u2019s co-counseling with Labaton Sucharow), the store chain is by far the largest business, with the largest advertising expenditures, to enter the litigation so far.  But plenty of other antitrust plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers are also representing clients in the consolidated case, including Hausfeld, Robins Kaplan, Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, Lowey Dannenberg, Wexler Wallace, Scott & Scott, Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer and Joseph Saveri Law Firm.  Judge Kendall, in other words, will have no shortage of candidates when she picks the lawyers who will lead the case. There are no statutory guidelines for picking antitrust lead plaintiffs or lawyers, unlike in securities class actions, but judges often look at the magnitude of potential damages to weigh how big a stake a potential lead plaintiff has in the outcome of the case. Judge Kendall has not yet set out a briefing schedule in the television ad sales MDL but you can be sure a lot of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers will be looking out for the filing.","169":"FILE PHOTO: The company logo is pictured on a Tesla Model X electric car in Berlin, Germany, November 13, 2019.

FILE PHOTO: An advertisement promotes Tesla Autopilot at a showroom of U.S. car manufacturer Tesla in Zurich, Switzerland March 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  The crash renews questions about the driver-assistance system\u2019s ability to detect hazards and has sparked concerns about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.  The NTSB\u2019s preliminary report said the driver engaged Autopilot about 10 seconds before crashing into a semitrailer, and the system did not detect the driver\u2019s hands on the wheel for fewer than eight seconds before the crash. The crash sheared off the roof as the Tesla traveled under the semitrailer.  The vehicle was traveling at about 68 miles (109 km) per hour (mph) on a highway with a 55-mph (89-kph) speed limit, and neither the system nor the driver made any evasive maneuvers, the agency said.  Tesla said in a statement that after the driver engaged the system he \u201cimmediately removed his hands from the wheel. Autopilot had not been used at any other time during that drive.\u201d  The company added that \u201cTesla drivers have logged more than one billion miles with Autopilot engaged, and our data shows that, when used properly by an attentive driver who is prepared to take control at all times, drivers supported by Autopilot are safer than those operating without assistance.\u201d  While some Tesla drivers say they are able to avoid holding the steering wheel for extended periods while using Autopilot, Tesla advises drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention while using the system.  David Friedman, a former acting NHTSA administrator, said the incident raises serious questions about the system and the lack of restrictions on its use.  \u201cEither Autopilot can\u2019t see the broad side of an 18-wheeler, or it can\u2019t react safely to it,\u201d said Friedman, a vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. \u201cThis system can\u2019t dependably navigate common road situations on its own and fails to keep the driver engaged exactly when needed most.\u201d  He said Tesla \u201cmust restrict Autopilot to conditions where it can be used safely and install a far more effective system to verify driver engagement.\u201d  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is also investigating the Delray Beach and said Thursday it is \u201ccarefully evaluating all available data and will share any findings upon conclusion of its investigation.\u201d  In May 2016, a Tesla Model S driver was killed near Williston, Florida, while Autopilot was engaged, when he slammed into a tractor trailer that also sheared off the vehicle roof.  In a fatal crash in Mountain View, California, in March 2018 involving a Model X in Autopilot mode, Tesla said vehicle logs showed the driver had received warnings to put his hands on the wheel but no action was taken by the driver ahead of the crash. That incident is being investigated by both the NTSB and NHTSA.  The NTSB said in 2017 that Tesla lacked proper safeguards allowing the driver \u201cto use the system outside of the environment for which it was designed and the system gave far too much leeway to the driver to divert his attention.\u201d  NHTSA, which has the power to order safety recalls, is investigating a fatal incident in Davie, Florida, on Feb. 24 involving a 2016 Tesla Model S that caught fire and burned the 48-year-old driver beyond recognition. It was not clear if Autopilot was engaged in this incident.  NHTSA can demand a recall if it believes a defect poses an unreasonable safety risk, while the NTSB makes safety recommendations.  The NTSB said it had reviewed forward-facing video from the Tesla in the Delray Beach crash.  NHTSA is also probing the January 2018 crash of a Tesla vehicle apparently traveling in Autopilot that struck a fire truck in Culver City, California; a May 2018 crash in Utah of a Tesla in Autopilot mode; and a May 2018 Tesla accident in Florida that killed two teenagers and injured another but was not in Autopilot mode.  The NTSB is also investigating an August 2017 Tesla battery fire in California, in which an owner ran the vehicle into his garage.","171":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Wednesday asked Tesla Inc to recall 158,000 Model S and Model X vehicles over media control unit (MCU) failures that could pose safety risks by leading to touchscreen displays not working.

If it does not agree it must provide the agency \u201cwith a full explanation of its decision.\u201d  It is unusual for the agency to formally demand a recall. Automakers typically voluntarily agree to a recall if sought in discussions by regulators.  The agency said it sought the recall after considering \u201cTesla\u2019s technical briefing presentation ... and evaluated Tesla\u2019s assertions.\u201d  NHTSA added that \u201cduring our review of the data, Tesla provided confirmation that all units will inevitably fail given the memory device\u2019s finite storage capacity.\u201d  NHTSA said other automakers have issued numerous recalls for similar safety issues, the agency told Tesla, including a detailed list of prior callbacks.  The agency said touchscreen failures pose significant safety issues, including the loss of rearview\/backup camera images. It noted nine prior recalls by other automakers for similar problems.  The Tesla vehicles that lose touchscreen use may see driver assistance Autopilot system and turn signal functionality impacted due to potential loss of audible chimes, driver sensing, and alerts associated with these vehicle functions, NHTSA said. It added that loss of alerts tied to systems like Autopilot \u201cincreases the risk of a crash occurring because drivers may be unaware of system malfunctions.\u201d  Touchscreen failures result in drivers being unable to use windshield defogging and defrosting systems that \u201cmay decrease the driver\u2019s visibility in inclement weather, increasing the risk of crash.\u201d  NHTSA noted that \u201cTesla has implemented several over-the-air updates in an attempt to mitigate some of the issues ... but tentatively believes these updates are procedurally and substantively insufficient.\u201d It noted that under law \u201cvehicle manufacturers are required to conduct recalls to remedy safety-related defects.\u201d  NHTSA said in November it reviewed 12,523 claims and complaints about the issue, which would impact roughly 8% of the vehicles under investigation.

The agency declined to comment and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Tesla shares fell 2.4 percent to $370.34 on Wednesday after closing up 11 percent on Tuesday, ending about $50 per share below what Musk said he was considering offering.

In a statement on Tesla's website bit.ly\/2vJiaMm, six of Tesla's nine directors said the board had met several times over the last week to discuss such an idea and was \"taking the appropriate next steps to evaluate this.\"  Musk\u2019s plan for a price of $420 a share would value a deal at more than $70 billion.  Tesla said on Wednesday the discussions had addressed the issue of how to fund such a deal, but gave no details. The statement did not address how the $420-per-share price was established.  Public companies have four days here to report certain material events that shareholders should know about to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The deal would be the biggest leveraged buyout of all time, beating the $45 billion record set by Texas power utility Energy Future Holdings.  The most obvious equity partners for Musk would be a sovereign wealth fund such as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), which sources said on Tuesday had taken a stake of just below 5 percent in Tesla, or a major technology investment fund such as SoftBank Group Corp's 9984.T Vision Fund, bankers said.  SoftBank is currently not interested in a deal for Tesla after earlier this year taking a stake in General Motors Co's GM.N self-driving unit, Cruise, Reuters reported earlier on Wednesday.

REUTERS\/Aaron P. Bernstein\/File Photo  Musk and SoftBank held unsuccessful talks about a take-private deal in April 2017, according to a source familiar with the matter. Bloomberg News, which first reported on that meeting, said the talks failed to progress due to disagreements over ownership.  China's Tencent Holdings Ltd 0700.HK, which took a 5 percent stake in Tesla last year, could also be a possible partner.  SURPRISE MOVE  In a letter here after his tweet on Tuesday, Musk fleshed out his idea, suggesting shareholders would get the option to sell their shares or remain investors in a private Tesla, out of the glare of Wall Street and its need for positive quarterly results.  He said that would allow Tesla to \u201coperate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible.\u201d  Some on Wall Street shared that view.  \u201cThey\u2019re being bombarded with questions that we don\u2019t think are as relevant to the long-term value of the company,\u201d said Sam Korus, an analyst for ARK Investment Management, which had 443,874 Tesla shares as of June 30. Korus said he would need more details from Musk to judge whether a buyout offer would be practical and at what price it would be attractive.  Musk has been under intense pressure this year to turn his company into a profitable higher-volume manufacturer, a prospect that has sent Tesla\u2019s valuation higher than that of GM.  The company is still working its way out of what Musk called \u201cproduction hell\u201d at its home factory in Fremont, California, where a series of manufacturing challenges delayed the ramp-up of production of its new Model 3 sedan, on which the company\u2019s profitability rests.  Musk has feuded publicly with regulators, critics, short sellers and reporters, and some analysts suggested that less transparency would be welcomed by Musk.  The six board members who issued the statement on Wednesday included James Murdoch, chief executive of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOXA.O and Brad Buss, who was the chief financial officer of solar panel maker SolarCity until it was bought by Tesla in 2016.  Other board members mentioned in the statement included Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio Gracias and Linda Johnson Rice. Tesla\u2019s other board members are Musk, his brother Kimbal Musk and venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson.","178":"BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla stands to receive at least 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in public funding from Germany for setting up a battery cell factory near Berlin, Business Insider reported on Monday.

The EU\u2019s approval of the 2.9 billion euro European Battery Innovation project, which includes more than 40 companies, follows the launch in 2017 of the European Battery Alliance to support the industry during the shift away from fossil fuels.  Business Insider quoted German government sources as saying Tesla would get subsidies of more than 1 billion euros from the federal government and the regional state of Brandenburg, where the Tesla factory is being built.  A spokeswoman for Germany\u2019s economy ministry said it was not yet clear how much federal support Tesla would receive.  The ministry said last week that Berlin had made nearly 1 billion euros available for the initial battery cell alliance and planned to support the second project with another 1.6 billion euros.  A spokeswoman for the economy ministry in the state of Brandenburg declined to comment.  Tesla was not immediately available for comment.  The federal government is expected to shoulder the lion\u2019s share of the subsidies with Brandenburg likely to contribute less than 10%.

FILE PHOTO: A man is reflected on Panasonic Corp's logo at Panasonic Center in Tokyo, Japan, February 2, 2017. REUTERS\/Kim Kyung-Hoon\/File Photo  The trade dispute is making it more painful for Panasonic to execute its strategy of shifting focus to corporate clients and automakers from consumer electronics, after Tesla\u2019s production delays already posed challenges to the goal.  Higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods battered sales of Panasonic\u2019s electronic devices, while the slumping automotive market in China prompted the auto industry to scale back manufacturing investment and took a toll on factory equipment sales.  \u201cAutomotive sales in China slumped and dampened investment appetite\u201d in the automotive industry, Chief Financial Officer Hirokazu Umeda said at an earnings briefing on Wednesday.  Umeda also said the Gigafactory joint venture with the U.S. electric car maker is still in the process of ramping up to the planned annual production capacity of 35 gigawatt-hours and related costs kept the Tesla battery business in the red.  Panasonic, the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla, posted an operating profit of 56.39 billion yen ($519.68 million) for the April-June quarter, down 44% from 99.96 billion yen a year prior.  That was below a consensus estimate of 70.93 billion yen from eight analysts compiled by Refinitiv.  The automotive business, which includes automotive batteries, posted a loss of 10 billion yen, larger than a year-before loss of 1.5 billion yen. It generated 20% of the company\u2019s overall sales.  Panasonic maintained its profit forecast for the year ending March at 300 billion yen, versus a consensus estimate of 319.97 billion yen from 20 analysts.  Umeda said weaker sales of Tesla Model S sedans and Model X SUVs have slowed battery shipments from Japan and hurt profits.  Tesla shares slumped last week after the car maker pushed back its profit timeline once again, reported lower margins and announced the departure of its chief technology officer.  Panasonic has turned cautious about further spending on capacity growth for Tesla battery production, while it is planning to launch a new battery joint venture with Toyota Motor Corp.  Panasonic shares have halved since late 2017, dragged down by concerns about a lack of growth drivers as well as the high susceptibility to Tesla\u2019s fortunes.","180":"FILE PHOTO: A charging station for electric-powered Tesla cars is seen in Melide near Lugano, Switzerland May 9, 2018.

FILE PHOTO: Tesla CEO Elon Musk gestures during a conversation at the E3 gaming convention in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 13, 2019. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Analysts expect the Tesla pickup, which Musk has said would combine the performance of a Porsche 911 sports car with the functionality of Ford Motor Co\u2019s industry-leading F-150 full-size truck, to debut in late 2021 or early 2022 with a starting price of under $50,000.  \u201cMaking an electric pickup truck that sells in the same price range as an F-150 and making it profitable will be tough,\u201d said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at Auto Forecast Solutions.  As Musk pushes to take a bite of Detroit\u2019s profits, Ford and larger rival General Motors Co are gearing up to challenge Tesla more directly with new offerings like the Ford Mustang Mach E electric SUV as well as electric pickups.  Electric pickups and SUVs - the heart of the U.S. market - could help Ford and GM generate the significant EV sales they will need to meet tougher emission standards and EV mandates in California and other states. The Trump administration is moving to roll back those standards, but electric trucks are a hedge if California prevails.  Pricier trucks also offer carmakers a better chance to generate profit from their electric battery investments, Fiorani said.  The pickup\u2019s introduction will shift Tesla more toward trucks and SUVs, where Detroit\u2019s automakers get most of their profits. Tesla has so far sold mostly Model S and Model 3 sedans, but also offers the Model X SUV and starting next year the Model Y compact SUV.  Tesla officials declined to comment ahead of the truck\u2019s reveal on Thursday in Los Angeles.  A focus on the high-performance end of the market is only natural given the success of Ford\u2019s 450-horsepower F-150 Raptor truck, which launched in 2009 and whose sales have since risen annually, according to Ford spokesman Mike Levine.  While Ford does not disclose Raptor sales, Levine said annual demand is well above 19,000 vehicles and the No. 2 U.S. automaker has never had to offer incentives on the model, which costs in the high $60,000 range. Ford also offers the more expensive F-150 Limited, its most powerful and luxurious pickup.  \u2018ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER\u2019  Demand for full-size electric pickup trucks in the near term may not be huge, however.  Industry tracking firm IHS Markit estimates the electric truck segment - both full- and mid-sized models - will account for about 75,000 sales in 2026, compared with an expected 3 million light trucks overall. The Tesla truck is not part of that estimate given its uncertain timing.  Musk in October described the Tesla pickup as \u201ccloser to an armored personnel carrier from the future.\u201d Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner said such a design carries the risk of not appealing to traditional truck buyers and consigning Tesla\u2019s vehicle to niche status.  Tesla has shown teaser images and Musk promised certain features on Twitter last year, saying it would be similar in size to Ford\u2019s F-150. The Tesla truck will have all-wheel drive with \u201ccrazy torque,\u201d a suspension that dynamically adjusts for load and a driving range of up to 500 miles as an option, he said. In March, Musk called it a \u201ccyberpunk truck.\u201d  Ford and GM officials often say they understand pickup buyers better than anyone, but they are not taking chances, with plans to introduce their own electric trucks. Both also will build electric SUVs.  Ford aims to sell an electric F-series in late 2021, sources familiar with the plans said. It also will offer the Mach E next year as part of its plan to invest $11.5 billion by 2022 electrifying its vehicles.  In April, Ford invested $500 million in startup Rivian, which plans to build its own electric pickup beginning in fall 2020.  GM plans to build a family of premium electric pickup trucks and SUVs, beginning in late 2021 with an electric pickup - possibly under the Hummer brand - followed by a performance variant in 2022 and a GMC truck in 2023, sources have said. It plans to invest $8 billion by 2023 to develop electric and self-driving vehicles.","187":"FILE PHOTO: The company logo is pictured on a Tesla Model X electric car in Berlin, Germany, November 13, 2019.

It argued that the \u201cname \u2018Teslaquila\u2019 evokes the word Tequila ... (and) Tequila is a protected word.\u201d  The CRT keeps tabs on producers to assure they adhere to strict denomination of origin rules, which dictate the spirit must be made in the Mexican states of Guanajuato, Jalisco, Michoacan, Nayarit or Tamaulipas, among other requirements.  According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office website, Tesla has filed an application to trademark \u201cTeslaquila\u201d as a \u201cdistilled agave liquor\u201d and \u201cdistilled blue agave liquor.\u201d Similar applications have been filed in Mexico, the European Union and Jamaica.  \u201cIf it wants to make Teslaquila viable as a tequila it would have to associate itself with an authorized tequila producer, comply with certain standards and request authorization from Mexico\u2019s Industrial Property Institute,\u201d said the CRT in a statement.  \u201cOtherwise it would be making unauthorized use of the denomination of origin for tequila,\u201d it said, adding that the proposed name \u201cTeslaquila\u201d could make consumers confuse the drink with tequila.  Tesla did not respond to several requests for comment.  Other high-profile celebrities have cashed in on tequila\u2019s new-found international appeal, as the sprit moves into the ranks of top-shelf liquors and sheds its image as a fiery booze drunk by desperadoes and frat boys.  Last year, Diageo Plc bought actor George Clooney\u2019s high-end tequila brand Casamigos for up to $1 billion.  Other recent deals in the industry include Bacardi Ltd\u2019s January deal to buy fine tequila maker Patron Spirits International for $5.1 billion.

REUTERS\/Aly Song  HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Investors were chirpy after electric-car maker Tesla unveiled an unexpected profit for the third quarter. It also said its Shanghai factory is almost ready, putting icing on the cake. But founder Elon Musk has over-promised before, and there are questions about his China strategy. Traders who added almost a fifth to the company\u2019s market value on Thursday could use a pinch of salt.  The $143 million net profit reported on Wednesday marked a welcome change from last quarter\u2019s $408 million loss, and shares popped 18% the following day. But the outperformance reflected cost cuts, not growing sales; automotive revenue fell 12% from a year earlier.  The new China factory could deliver a much-needed boost to volumes. It might take a while, though. Trial production is underway in Shanghai, but that only marks the end of the beginning. Final government approvals are still pending. Musk wants the facility to eventually produce almost a third of the 500,000 Model 3 units Tesla plans to churn out every year globally, but the initial production target is 1,000 units a week.  The company notes that deliveries of premium sedans in the People\u2019s Republic outstripped both North America and Europe last year. But that glosses over another inconvenient truth: the market is in the midst of an historic downturn. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers expects overall sales to drop 5% this year. At the same time Beijing is winding down subsidies for new energy vehicles. Sales of electric autos fell by a third in September compared with the same month in 2018. There could be worse to come: new policies seem to favour hybrids, according to analysts at Bernstein.  Tesla\u2019s earlier models are aimed at wealthy consumers, which is good because that segment remains a bright spot in China. But Musk\u2019s \u201cMaster Plan, Part Deux\u201d, calls for \u201can affordable, high volume car\u201d to take up most of the Shanghai plant\u2019s capacity.

The electric carmaker, led by billionaire CEO Elon Musk, said it will cut prices of the two models by 12-26 percent to make the cars more \u201caffordable\u201d in the world\u2019s top auto market, where sales of so-called new-energy vehicles are rising fast.  The move comes amid severe trade tensions between China and the United States, which has seen extra tariffs slapped on U.S. imports into the country, including automobiles, hurting Tesla which imports all the cars it currently sells in the market.  \u201cWe are absorbing a significant part of the tariff to help make our cars more affordable for customers in China,\u201d Tesla said in a statement sent to Reuters.  The move marks a shift from July when Tesla was one of the first U.S. carmakers to raise prices in the market in response to tariffs. The firm hiked prices then on its Model X and S cars by about 20 percent.  Tesla warned last month it was facing major problems with selling cars in China due to new tariffs that would force it to accelerate investment in its first overseas Gigafactory in Shanghai.  The carmaker last month secured the site for the facility, which will help it avoid steep import tariffs.  The firm, which recently launched pre-sales of its new Model 3 car in China, added in its statement that the car\u2019s pricetag would start from 540,000 yuan ($77,928.83) for a dual motor all-wheel drive version, and 595,000 yuan for a performance version.  Before the price hike in July, Tesla had lowered prices on its models in China in May, after Beijing had said it would cut import tariffs for all auto imports.

The German Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Controls (BAFA) said on its website it had returned Tesla to the list of electric cars eligible for subsidies on March 6.  The agency had taken the carmaker\u2019s vehicles off the list in December, citing as the reason that customers could not order the Model S base version without extra features that pushed the car above the 60,000 euro ($74,000) price limit.  Tesla had denied at the time that no-frills versions of the Model S were not available.  Germany in 2016 launched the incentive scheme worth about 1 billion euros, partly financed by the German car industry, to boost electric car usage. A price cap was included to exempt premium models.  Under the subsidy scheme, buyers get 4,000 euros off their all-electric vehicle purchase and 3,000 euros off plug-in hybrids.  \u201cThe manufacturer proved with an independent assessment that a base version of the Model S is available on the market for less than 60,000 euros,\u201d German daily newspaper Die Welt on Thursday quoted Bafa as saying.  It said, however, that the agency was reviewing previously approved applications for subsidies as it was unclear whether Tesla had stuck with the price limit in the past.","194":"FILE PHOTO: Siemens CEO Joe Kaeser looks on before visit of German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the company's plant in Goerlitz, Germany, July 15, 2019.

Tesla\u2019s 5-year credit default swap hit its highest price ever on Friday, the day after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it was suing Musk and pushing for his ouster. The agency said he made a series of \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d tweets about potentially taking Tesla private last month.  Musk said on Thursday he had done nothing wrong. The company\u2019s shares were down 12.3 percent at $269.72 on Friday afternoon.  It costs about $71,300 to insure $1 million of the electric carmaker\u2019s debt, plus an upfront cost of around 22.45 percent, which was also at an all-time high, representing a total of 29.58 percent of the face value of the company\u2019s 2025 junk bond , or around $295,000.

Traders were quoting the junk bond at 87 cents early on Thursday morning. As of Friday, it was at 84 cents on the dollar.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk is on the cusp of a roughly $750 million payday as the electric carmaker\u2019s stock recovers from a slump caused by the coronavirus, which led the company to close its factories and furlough workers.  FILE PHOTO: SpaceX owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk arrives on the red carpet for the automobile awards \"Das Goldene Lenkrad\" (The golden steering wheel) given by a German newspaper in Berlin, Germany, November 12, 2019. REUTERS\/Hannibal Hanschke  Shares of Tesla surged 10% on Monday ahead of the company\u2019s quarterly report this week, and in anticipation it could soon reopen its Fremont, California, plant after it was shuttered because of the pandemic.  Monday\u2019s rally put Tesla\u2019s market capitalization at $145 billion. Importantly for Musk, its stock market value reached a six-month average of $96 billion. Hitting a six-month average of $100 billion would trigger the vesting of the first of 12 tranches of options granted to the billionaire to buy Tesla stock as part of his two-year-old pay package.  Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 1.69 million Tesla shares at $350.02 each. Taking Monday\u2019s Tesla closing stock price of $798.75 as an example, Musk could sell those shares for a profit of $758 million.  Graphic - Elon Musk's options payout: here  Musk receives no salary or cash bonus, only options that vest based on Tesla\u2019s market cap and milestones for revenue and profit growth. Musk has already hit a growth target necessary for the first options to vest.  A full payoff for Musk, who is also the majority owner and CEO of the SpaceX rocket maker, would surpass anything previously granted to U.S. executives.  When Tesla unveiled Musk\u2019s package in 2018, it said he could theoretically reap as much as $55.8 billion if no new shares were issued. However, Tesla has since issued shares to compensate employees, and last year it sold $2.7 billion in shares and convertible bonds.  The potential payout for Musk comes after Tesla said this month it would furlough all non-essential workers and implement salary cuts during a shutdown of its U.S. production facilities because of the coronavirus outbreak. The pandemic has slashed U.S. demand for cars and forced several other automakers to also furlough U.S. workers.  Tesla\u2019s quarterly report after the bell on Wednesday will show the damage done to global demand by the pandemic and the extent to which a recovery from the coronavirus in China, and a return to production at its Shanghai plant, are helping the U.S. carmaker.  Investors will also focus on Tesla\u2019s cash burn related to its interrupted manufacturing and sales, and on Musk\u2019s expectations for consumer demand in a potential long-term global recession, Baird analyst Ben Kallo wrote in a client note last week. The closure of the Fremont plant came just as Tesla was increasing production of its new Model Y sport utility vehicle.  Analysts on average expect March quarter revenue to jump 30% to $5.9 billion, according to Refinitiv. That consensus revenue estimate is down from $6.7 billion at the start of February. Analysts on average expect a non-GAAP loss of 36 cents per share.  When shareholders approved Musk\u2019s pay package, Tesla was valued at about $53 billion and it faced a cash crunch, production delays and increasing competition from rivals. The pay deal was viewed as massively ambitious because it implied the company\u2019s value could grow as much as ten-fold in 10 years, and its potentially huge size led some shareholders to oppose it.  Tesla\u2019s market capitalization since then has expanded to nearly three times the combined values of General Motors and Ford Motor.  Musk\u2019s subsequent options tranches would vest at $50 billion increments of Tesla market capitalization over the agreement\u2019s 10-year period, with the billionaire earning the full package if Tesla\u2019s market capitalization reaches $650 billion and the high tech vehicle maker achieves several revenue and profit targets.","200":"July 10 (Reuters) - -- Source link: cnb.cx\/3iIUyiy  -- Note: Reuters has not verified this story and does not vouch for its accuracy","201":"(Reuters) - General Motors Co\u2019s GM.N Cadillac outscored Tesla Inc TSLA.O in a new ranking of partially automated driving systems tested by Consumer Reports and released on Thursday.

The organization said its tests, conducted on a private track and on public roads in Connecticut, were designed to measure the systems\u2019 ability to automatically control steering and speed in certain situations, while helping drivers pay attention and regain manual control of the vehicle when required.  The systems typically use cameras, radar and other sensors, as well as mapping data, to monitor location and traffic conditions and help keep a vehicle centered in the lane at a safe distance behind other cars.  Each system has limitations. Cadillac\u2019s Super Cruise, for instance, only functions on divided highways that have been mapped by GM. In contrast, Tesla\u2019s Autopilot can be used even on small, curvy roads with poor lane markings, but \u201coperates erratically in those situations,\u201d Consumer Reports said.

It ties the crypto asset class to a nearly trillion dollar and highly visible company that we are confident put substantial resources into vetting the decision and structure (and after its analysis, was confident moving forward). We also believe this will spark other companies (private and public) to explore Tesla\u2019s decision and determine whether they should look to do something similar. Simply put, Tesla\u2019s decision de-risks the decision for other companies, which could reasonably open the door for more corporate adoption.

Central to this promise is a new microchip for self-driving vehicles unveiled by Musk on Monday during a webcast presentation. Made by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd in Texas, the chip now in all vehicles is hoped to give Tesla an edge over rivals and show its massive investment in autonomous driving - described by Musk as \u201cbasically our entire expense structure\u201d - will pay off.  The webcast presentation came two days before Tesla is expected to announce a quarterly loss on fewer deliveries of its Model 3 sedan, which represents Tesla\u2019s attempt to become a volume car maker.  After launching the event with detailed technical descriptions of Tesla\u2019s progress on hardware and software by top executives, Musk began hawking the Model 3 and its potential.  \u201cThe fundamental message consumers should be taking away today is it\u2019s financially insane to buy something other than a Tesla. It\u2019s like buying a horse,\u201d saying Tesla was the only company to have a full self-driving suite of hardware.  Tesla\u2019s use of the term \u201cfull self-driving\u201d garners criticism, as it sells such an option today that is not yet \u201cLevel 4,\u201d or fully autonomous by industry standards, in which the car can handle all aspects of driving in most circumstances with no human intervention. Musk has said that with the hardware complete, improvements in software will allow vehicles to fully drive themselves in future.  The technology faces many regulatory hurdles both in Washington and from local governments.  Global carmakers, large technology companies and startups are developing self-driving - including Alphabet Inc\u2019s Waymo and Uber Technologies Inc - but experts say it will be years before the systems are ready for prime time.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  \u201cA year from now we\u2019ll have over a million cars with full self-driving, software, everything,\u201d Musk predicted.  Tesla has been working on a self-driving chip since 2016 and Musk had previously forecast that cars would be fully self-driving by 2018, a target Tesla has missed.  Investors appeared unmoved by the chip announcement but shares rose slightly in after-hour trading following the announcement of the robotaxis.  Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said Tesla\u2019s robotaxi ambition was \u201cimpressive,\u201d but added that investors will be concerned by \u201cthe practicality and financial implications of this endeavor especially with Waymo miles ahead of the autonomous competition.\u201d  More pressing for analysts, he said, were concerns about demand for the Model 3 and whether Tesla may seek new financing.  \u201cDOOMED\u201d RIVALS  Musk took a swipe at competitors relying on Lidar, light-based sensors that are a key element in most other self-driving systems.  \u201cLidar is a fools\u2019 errand. And anyone relying on Lidar is doomed,\u201d said Musk, who has been vocal about the technology\u2019s limitations. Tesla vehicles rely on cameras and radars as their vision system for self-driving.  Competitors will eventually \u201cdump\u201d Lidar, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s expensive and unnecessary and once you solved vision it\u2019s worthless.\u201d  More than $1 billion in corporate and private investment has been plowed into some 50 Lidar startups over the past three years, including a record $420 million in 2018, according to a Reuters analysis of publicly available investment data in March.  Musk called Tesla\u2019s new chip the industry\u2019s best because it was dedicated for autonomous driving, while others, like Nvidia Corp, developed chips for multiple uses.  Tesla\u2019s chip was capable of seven times as many frames as Nvidia\u2019s Xavier system, said Pete Bannon, Tesla\u2019s head of Autopilot hardware. Nvidia said the comparison was inaccurate.  U.S. magazine Consumer Reports cautioned against Tesla\u2019s \u201cbold claims about self-driving capabilities that overpromise and underdeliver.\u201d  \u201cClaims about (Tesla\u2019s) driving automation systems and safety are not backed up by the data, and it seems today\u2019s presentations had more to do with investors than consumers\u2019 safety,\u201d wrote the publication.","208":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O - the most heavily shorted U.S. company - is set to report quarterly results on Wednesday, and short-sellers could be dealt a nearly $850 million loss or gain, depending on the direction of the post-earnings stock move.

The electric carmaker, which is rapidly burning cash and struggling to turn a profit, is a favorite target for shorts.  About 35 million shares, or roughly 28 percent of Tesla\u2019s free float, are currently sold short, pegging the short interest at $10.53 billion, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners.  Based on the price of weekly Tesla options contracts set to expire on Friday, traders in the options market expect the shares to swing by about 8 percent after the company reports results.  A move of that magnitude to the upside would mean that short-sellers would rack up about $842.6 million in on-paper losses, while they would make as much in on-paper gains if the share reaction is negative, according to S3 data.  Headed into the results, short-sellers, who came in for a good deal of pain in the second-quarter as Tesla shares soared 29 percent, helped by encouraging production-related news, have shown little inclination to tweak their bets on the carmaker.  \u201cThere has been virtually no net change in shares shorted in over a week,\u201d said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 in New York.  \u201cAlthough short-sellers\u2019 conviction in Tesla\u2019s longer term performance is solid with no significant short covering since the end of June when Tesla hit its year-to-date highs, I haven\u2019t seen a rush to short more shares in anticipation of weak results,\u201d he said.

On Tuesday, billionaire hedge fund manager David Einhorn told investors that the rally in Tesla shares, which he bet against, turned into heavy losses at his Greenlight Capital fund.

In August, Tesla founder Elon Musk said the Saudi sovereign wealth fund could help him to take his company private.  The Lucid investment, which PIF said is more than $1 billion but did not give an exact figure, is also part of Saudi Arabia\u2019s plan to build an environmentally friendly economy, to diversify the kingdom away from reliance on crude oil.  \u201cThey\u2019re not just a financial partner they\u2019re a strategic partner,\u201d Lucid Chief Technology Officer Peter Rawlinson told Reuters.  \u201cIt\u2019s all the capital we need for three things: to continue the development of the car, to construct the factory in Arizona, and to initiate the rollout of our global retail strategy and that will commence in the U.S. because that\u2019s our first market,\u201d he said.  The company might plan to sell into China or build SUVs at a later date, Rawlinson said.  He said the company conceived itself as being less of a direct competitor to Tesla than with luxury gasoline car makers such as Audi or BMW.

Tesla sold 3,300 Model 3s in Norway in July-September, beating Volkswagen's VOWG_p.DE Golf by some 900 cars. But the Model 3 total was down from 6,123 in the first quarter and 4,438 in the second, according to the Norwegian Road Federation.  Seeking to end the sale of diesel and petrol engines by the middle of next decade, Norway exempts battery-powered cars from taxes imposed on fossil fuel vehicles.  Introduced to most European markets in early 2019, Tesla\u2019s mid-sized Model 3 sedan quickly became a bestseller in the Nordic nation, helping the country retain its top global ranking in per-capita electric vehicle sales.  Tesla is counting on the Model 3, which is cheaper than its larger Model S and Model X, to transform it from a loss-prone niche player to a profitable heavyweight in the auto industry.  Last week, an internal email said the U.S. company had \u201ca shot\u201d at delivering 100,000 cars globally in the July-September quarter, industry journal Electrek reported.

Concern that the memo signaled that money-losing Tesla was scrambling to find cash to fund its current operations and multiple long-term projects had sent shares down.  A Tesla spokesperson said the electric vehicle maker had asked fewer than 10 of its suppliers for a reduction in \u201ctotal capex project spend for long-term projects that began in 2016 but are still not complete.\u201d  Any pricing adjustments would improve Tesla\u2019s \u201cfuture cash flows, but not impact our ability to achieve profitability in Q3,\u201d the spokesperson added.

Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has said the company does not need to raise cash this year, but several analysts have predicted that the electric car maker would need to raise capital soon.

FILE PHOTO: The Apple logo is seen on the Apple store at the Marche Saint Germain in Paris, France July 15, 2020. REUTERS\/Gonzalo Fuentes\/File Photo  Investors cheered the Apple and Tesla announcements, helping extend a rally in the companies\u2019 shares, which along with many other technology firms, have soared in value as the market emerged from its pandemic-induced depths in March.  That made owning a piece of these companies seem out of reach of many Main Street investors. Apple closed at over $500 a share on Thursday, while Tesla continued its meteoric rise on Thursday to above $2,200 a share.  Both Apple and Tesla said their actions, a 4-1 and 5-1 split respectively, would let more investors access their shares.  But in the past year, online brokerages like Robinhood, Charles Schwab Corp SCHW.N, and Fidelity, along with several smaller shops, have begun offering slices of individual shares.  \u201cFractional share ownership, all else equal, really does render the price of a stock irrelevant,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG.  That, combined with commission-free trading at most brokerages, has made it easier for anyone with a mobile device to own a piece of a company.  \"People my age grew up with technology and we like to invest in technology-related companies, like Tesla and Amazon AMZN.O and Google GOOGL.O, and if it weren't for fractional shares we wouldn't really be able to take advantage of that,\" said Jaidan Craig, a support technician.  Craig, 23, said he has been investing for two or three years, first on Robinhood, which lets people invest as little as $1 in any listed company, and then moved to a broker called M1, which emphasizes diversifying your investments. He said that without fractional investing, he could not have built as well-rounded a portfolio.  FIRST INNING  While fractional shares have been used for years by mutual funds, they have not as been widely available for stocks until recently, and not every brokerage offers them, helping maintain the appeal of stock splits on some platforms.  TD Ameritrade, a online trading pioneer that is being bought by rival Schwab for $26 billion, does not offer fractional shares, but said it is looking at them.  It noted that in past years, when companies, such as Apple, Google, Mastercard Inc MA.N and Visa Inc V.N, split their shares, retail trading volumes tripled.  \u201cWe have historically seen that our retail investors use stock splits as trading opportunities, accessing popular names that may have gotten too expensive pre-split,\u201d said JJ Kinnahan, TD Ameritrade\u2019s chief market analyst.  Robinhood, which was founded in 2013 and is now valued at $11.2 billion, said that while from a psychological perspective, a stock trading in the thousands appears much more prohibitive than a stock trading in the low hundreds, perceptions are shifting.  \u201cAs fractional shares trading becomes more popular at retail brokerages, the importance and need for stock splits diminish,\u201d said Rebecca Moretti, a writer at Robinhood Snacks.  Just three S&P 500 .SPX members have announced splits in 2020, compared with an average of 10 a year over the past decade, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.  Those companies that have split their shares in the past year have, in fact, underperformed the broader S&P 500, said BTIG\u2019s Emanuel, who likened the current state of fractional investing to the beginning of a baseball game.  \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re in the first inning of it, and yet you have seen a relative underperformance of split shares versus the S&P 500 in 2020, really points to the powerful nature of it,\u201d he said.

The share price tumbled further later in the session after Business Insider reported that Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk ordered workers to stop putting Model 3 cars through a brake and roll test before leaving the factory.

The achievement of the production milestone suggests \u201chigher costs, given the seemingly inefficient methods in which Tesla is reported to have achieved its production target\u201d including the construction of a temporary assembly line in a tent next to its main factory, Brinkman said.

REUTERS\/Aly Song  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk is adding to the gloom that has enveloped much of the automotive sector in recent months. Tesla\u2019s chief executive on Friday effectively issued the firm\u2019s first profit warning. In an email to employees he wrote that he would be reducing staff by 7 percent.  In addition, he admitted not only that fourth-quarter profit would be lower than in the previous three months, but also that it would take \u201cgreat difficulty, effort and some luck\u201d to turn a \u201ctiny profit\u201d between January and the end of March. Shareholders immediately wiped almost 10 percent off the stock, reducing the company\u2019s market value to $54 billion. But Musk\u2019s rare dose of realism could serve Tesla well.  Usually he\u2019s hyping up everything from the cars\u2019 performance to how quickly the company can produce them. His Friday missive, though, makes it clear that Tesla is currently struggling to sustainably make \u2013 or have a durable market for - 5,000 Model 3 sedans a week. Raising production and sales to 10,000 a week, as he has promised so often in the past, will be far harder, even after bringing European and Asian markets into the mix.  That may change once the company finally introduces the more affordable $35,000 version of the Model 3; to date the average sale price has been $59,000, according to FactSet. Trouble is, Tesla will have to produce a lot more of the lower-priced cars to make up for the 41 percent sticker-price drop.  Culling some 3,400 employees would not help much. UBS reckons that would save some $200 million a year, which would boost Tesla\u2019s estimated pre-tax margin for the year, all else being equal, by less than a percentage point to 2.4 percent, based on Refinitiv data.  Fewer staff could always make production harder. Sure, fast-expanding firms gather flab that needs trimming and Tesla has doubtless learned from its year or more of what Musk dubbed \u201cproduction hell.\u201d But the company also must address growing complaints about quality and after-sales customer service.  All of this sounds worrying \u2013 and it is. But if Musk\u2019s unusual openness about the company\u2019s current financial state is a sign of a more practical approach \u2013 whether by him alone or with a more engaged board of directors \u2013 that\u2019s no bad thing.","224":"Feb 4 (Reuters) - Maxwell Technologies Inc, a developer of battery technology, said on Monday it had agreed to be bought by Tesla Inc for $218 million.

Alameda County, where the factory is based, is one of six covered by an order from regional officials to \u201cshelter in place,\u201d which limits activity, travel and business functions to only the most essential, and advises people to stay home except for the most crucial reasons.  The county sheriff\u2019s office said on Tuesday afternoon Tesla was not considered an essential business under that order and cannot continue to operate its factory normally.  Reuters witnesses on Wednesday morning saw thousands of cars in the factory\u2019s employee parking lot in Fremont, California, and employees were going to work as several 18-wheeler container trucks were seen pulling into the factory grounds.  A trailer hauling two white Tesla Model 3s and a white Model X was seen leaving the factory mid-morning local time.  At least two food trucks were parked in front of the factory building.

The parking lots remained as full as they had been throughout the morning. Workers clad in yellow safety vests climbed ladders to work on what appeared to be ventilation equipment on the factory\u2019s west side, and a landscaping contractor rode a lawnmower around the grounds.  The county spokesman said on Wednesday county officials needed to move on to other issues regarding the virus rather than focus on Tesla.  \u201cTesla needs to comply with the health order,\u201d he said, adding that the county did not want to force people into compliance, but implement changes with their consent.  The spokesman said the county has had very good communications with Tesla, which had been very helpful navigating the issue.  Tesla did not respond to repeated requests for comment on Wednesday.  A spokeswoman for the Fremont Police Department on Wednesday said attorneys for Alameda County and the city were discussing how to interpret the lockdown order by San Francisco Bay Area officials.  \u201cThis is all very new and there are a lot of moving parts,\u201d the spokeswoman said, adding that the conversations concern all manufacturers in the region.  The attorneys are not discussing enforcement or disobedience measures, but were trying to understand how state and federal exemptions factored in, she said.  The offices of Fremont\u2019s mayor and the Alameda County district did not respond to requests for comment. The California governor\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.

The 21st Century Herald, a Chinese business newspaper that reported the job postings on Tuesday, said Tesla began advertising the roles on Sunday.  Tesla signed agreements with Shanghai authorities last month to build its first factory outside the United States, which would double the size of its global manufacturing.  The automaker planned to produce the first cars about two years after construction began on the factory, ramping up to as many as 500,000 vehicles a year about two to three years later.  Those agreements followed the May hiring of James Zhou as Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer for China.  Chief Executive Elon Musk said on an earnings call this month the factory would cost around $2 billion and Tesla planned to fund the project with local debt.  Last week, in a letter to investors, the company said the first cars would begin to be built in about three years, or 2021. But during a call with analysts, Musk gave a timeframe that did not match the letter to investors, saying the Shanghai plant would be key to its goal of producing 1 million vehicles per year by 2020.

ISS also backed two shareholder proposals to be voted on at the company\u2019s annual meeting set for June 5, including one that would require it to separate the current chairman and CEO roles of founder Elon Musk.  \u201cThe complexity of large-scale manufacturing and the challenges of successfully commercializing new technologies and new manufacturing and marketing techniques suggest that shareholders would be better served by having Musk focus on running the company, and allowing an independent director to run the board,\u201d according to a copy of ISS\u2019 recommendations seen by Reuters.  The recommendations by the top proxy adviser echo those made earlier this week by rival Glass Lewis, although ISS did side with Tesla and recommend investors vote for Musk\u2019s brother and current director Kimbal Musk.  Union-affiliated activist CtW Investment Group has criticized the three Tesla directors up for election this year as being too close to Elon Musk or unqualified.  In its report, ISS wrote that Gracias, CEO of Valor Management Corp, is not sufficiently independent for key board committees. It also cited concerns regarding the lack of performance-based elements in Tesla\u2019s pay plan in recommending the vote against Gracias, a compensation committee member.  ISS wrote that Murdoch is \u201coverboarded\u201d since he serves as the CEO of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc and on other boards.  A Tesla director not up for election this year because of the board\u2019s staggered election schedule is Steve Jurvetson.

FILE PHOTO: A Tesla dealership is seen in West Drayton, just outside London, Britain, February 7, 2018. REUTERS\/Hannah McKay\/File Photo  The Center for Auto Safety and Consumer Watchdog, both non-profit groups, sent a letter to the FTC saying that consumers could be misled into thinking, based on Tesla\u2019s marketing and advertising, that Autopilot makes a Tesla vehicle self-driving.  Autopilot, released in 2015, is an enhanced cruise-control system that partially automates steering and braking. Tesla states in its owner\u2019s manual and in disclaimers that when the system is engaged, a driver must keep hands on the wheel at all times while using Autopilot.  \u201cThe feedback that we get from our customers shows that they have a very clear understanding of what Autopilot is, how to properly use it, and what features it consists of,\u201d a Tesla spokesperson said.  But in the letter, the groups said that a series of ads and press releases from Tesla as well as statements by the company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, \u201cmislead and deceive customers into believing that Autopilot is safer and more capable than it is known to be.\u201d  \u201cTesla is the only automaker to market its Level 2 vehicles as \u2018self-driving\u2019, and the name of its driver assistance suite of features, Autopilot, connotes full autonomy,\u201d the letter read.  \u201cThe burden now falls on the FTC to investigate Tesla\u2019s unfair and deceptive practices so that consumers have accurate information, understand the limitations of Autopilot, and conduct themselves appropriately and safely,\u201d it read.  Tesla has also faced criticism from an influential magazine, Consumer Reports, over braking flaws in its Model 3 sedan, which is seen as key to the company\u2019s profitability. Musk has promised a quick fix.  Meanwhile, the popularity of the Model 3 has led to more registrations in California for the first quarter than class rivals BMW 3-Series and Mercedes C-Class, according to the California New Car Dealers Association (CNCDA).  California is a key market for global luxury vehicle brands not just because of its size, but because other markets often follow trends set by wealthy consumers in the state.  Several crashes and fire incidents involving a Tesla car this year has been a constant headache for Musk, who boasts that his company\u2019s cars are among the safest in the industry.  Two U.S. Tesla drivers have died in crashes in which Autopilot was engaged. The most recent crash, in March, is being investigated by safety regulators.  Tesla has said the use of Autopilot results in 40 percent fewer crashes, a claim the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration repeated in a 2017 report on the first fatality, which occurred in May 2016. Earlier this month, however, the agency said regulators had not assessed the effectiveness of the technology.  Last month, another group, Consumers Union, the advocacy division of Consumer Reports, called on Tesla to improve the safety of its Autopilot system.

A recent crash involving Tesla\u2019s autopilot technology and concerns about the company\u2019s ability to raise new capital also took a toll.  Tesla, founded by billionaire Elon Musk, declined to comment on production numbers for the Model 3, which are expected to be released this week.  The stock briefly pared losses after auto industry blogs - citing an unverified memo - reported that production of the Model 3 passed the 2,000 per week production rate. That would be short of Tesla\u2019s own target of 2,500 per week for the end of March but far above the 793 Model 3s built in the final week of last year.  \u201cMusk himself is focusing time on Model 3 production because it is the \u201chighest priority,\u201d a Tesla spokesman said on Monday, saying that engineering chief Doug Field was focused on vehicle engineering.  The company\u2019s statement followed a report that Musk had taken charge of Model 3 production after several missed production deadlines.  In a series of tweets Musk said he had asked Field to manage both engineering and production to better align both businesses, a year earlier.

In addition to the Model 3 production rate, he cited a recent Moody\u2019s downgrade of Tesla\u2019s credit rating and the crash of a Tesla Model X and the company\u2019s comments since the crash.  \u201cIt comes down to the Model 3. That\u2019s the key,\u201d Boase said. \u201cIf they can profitably build those cars that would be a huge step in the right direction.  \u201cIf you couldn\u2019t do (2,000) without using all the resources and at a decent margin level, what have you really achieved?\u201d he added.  Another investor who said he has profitably sold Tesla shares short four times in the last 18 months was also skeptical.  \u201cAre they really at 2,000 or did they just stuff their system to achieve 2,000 for last week?\u201d said David Kudla, chief executive and chief investment strategist at Mainstay Capital Management, who said he currently has no bets on Tesla.  \u201cThe only position I\u2019d have on it is short because they aren\u2019t making any money. Their operating losses are growing. The stock\u2019s been overvalued for months,\u201d he said.  Tesla said on Friday that the Model X involved in a fatal crash in California last week had activated its Autopilot system, raising new questions about the semi-autonomous system that handles some driving tasks.  Tesla\u2019s shares closed down $13.65 at $252.48 on Monday, after earlier hitting their lowest level in just over a year. So far in 2018, the shares are down 19 percent, at a time when technology shares have suffered particularly as stock prices fall across the board.  Tesla has said it had about 500,000 advance reservations from customers for the Model 3, but manufacturing bottlenecks since last July have delayed production and deliveries to customers, exacerbating the company\u2019s need for cash.  Failure to meet targets and pressures on funding prompted Moody\u2019s downgrade last week, saying that Tesla was likely to raise more than $2 billion in new capital, partly to cover about $1.2 billion in convertible bonds due by March 2019.  Tesla still has loyal investors, including Zevenbergen Capital Investments in Seattle, which has owned the stock since the company\u2019s initial public offering.  \u201cHistorically, volatility has provided good entry points. Looking at it today we believe the demand outlook remains robust and unchanged,\u201d said Joseph Dennison, portfolio manager at Zevenbergen. \u201cI still believe their product targets and outlook they\u2019ve given in the past.

Batteries make electric cars cost more than gasoline-powered ones, so the ability to produce low-cost, long-lasting batteries could put Tesla cars on a more equal footing and help usher in mainstream acceptance.  Musk in August suggested on Twitter that Tesla may be able to mass produce batteries with 50% more energy density in three to four years, which could even enable electric airplanes.  A much hyped \u201cAutonomy Investor Day\u201d in April last year failed to stop a five-month decline in the company\u2019s stock. At that 2019 event, Musk said that Tesla robotaxis with no human drivers would be available in some U.S. markets in 2020, continuing a habit of making bold pronouncements and setting deadlines Tesla does not meet.  \u201cEven if Tesla provides overly ambitious aspirations at Battery Day, we nevertheless expect the event to reinforce Tesla\u2019s long-term growth narrative \u2013 central to the stock, while also reinforcing investor perception that Tesla is ahead of other automakers,\u201d wrote Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy in a Sept. 16 research note.  New battery cell designs, chemistries and manufacturing processes are just some developments that would allow Tesla to reduce its reliance on its long-time battery partner, Japan\u2019s Panasonic.  Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne said in a recent client note he expects Tesla to announce it is bringing battery cell production in-house, and for Musk to focus on work done on \u201cmillion mile\u201d batteries.

Panasonic\u2019s initial investment in the Gigafactory is almost complete, and the Japanese electronics maker has not made any decisions on whether to pledge further funds, Ito said.  The comments come after Tesla hit its target of producing 5,000 Model 3 electric sedans on Sunday morning, several hours after the midnight goal set by Chief Executive Elon Musk, two workers at the factory told Reuters.  Production of the Model 3, which began last July, has been plagued by a number of issues, including over-reliance on automation creating bottlenecks in battery production.  Meanwhile, the U.S. firm has been burning through cash as it tools up its assembly line and works on projects such as its Model Y crossover sport utility vehicle.  Its free cash flow - a metric of financial health - widened to negative $1 billion in its latest reporting quarter from negative $277 million three months prior, excluding costs of systems for its solar business.  Musk has said Tesla it will not need to seek cash in 2018 but Wall Street analysts anticipate a capital raise this year.  Panasonic is the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla\u2019s current production models, making them in Japan as well as at the $5 billion Gigafactory.  Ito said last week at Panasonic\u2019s general shareholders meeting that a pickup in production of the Model 3 has resulted in occasional battery cell shortages.","243":"Oct 29 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's third-quarter revenue fell 39% in the United States, a regulatory filing showed here on Tuesday.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.  The launch of the $35,000 version, Tesla\u2019s cheapest model, last week comes at a crucial time for the company as some analysts had raised concerns that demand for the higher-priced versions of the Model 3 was beginning to dry up in the United States, especially after a federal tax credit was cut in half this year.  Tesla also said last week its global sales would now be online-only, in a bid to cut overhead costs.","245":"TOKYO, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp unveiled a completely redesigned hydrogen-powered fuel cell sedan on Friday in its latest attempt to revive demand for the niche technology that it hopes will become mainstream.  Japan\u2019s biggest automaker has been developing fuel-cell vehicles for more than two decades, but the technology has been eclipsed by the rapid rise of rival battery-powered electric vehicles promoted by the likes of Tesla Inc.  Ahead of the Tokyo Motor Show starting on Oct. 24, Toyota unveiled a prototype of the new hydrogen sedan built on the same platform as its luxury Lexus brand\u2019s LS coupe. The new Mirai model boasts longer driving range than its predecessor and completely redesigned fuel cell stack and hydrogen tanks, the company said.  \u201cWe wanted to make a car that people really want to buy, not just because it\u2019s an eco car,\u201d Yoshikazu Tanaka, chief engineer of the new Mirai, said at the unveiling.  \u201cWe wanted something that\u2019s fun to drive.\u201d  Its sporty redesign with longer wheelbase and lower-slung chassis is a marked departure from the first-generation Mirai, which looks like a bulked-up Prius hybrid.  The new car also has a 30% improvement in driving range over the previous iteration\u2019s approximately 700 kilometers (435 miles), according to the company.  Tanaka said the latest Mirai would cost less to make than its predecessor, because of a shift to mass production. The current model is mostly assembled by hand.  Costing consumers about 5 million yen ($46,500) after subsidies in Japan, the original Mirai is one of three fuel cell cars available to consumers. Hyundai Motor Co sells the Nexo, while Honda Motor Co Ltd leases out the Clarity.  Toyota has sold fewer than 10,000 of the Mirai, a fuel cell sedan it touted as a game changer at its launch five years ago. By contrast, Tesla sold 25,000 of battery-powered Model S sedans in its first year and a half.  Toyota declined to disclose a price for the model and said it would be available from late next year in Japan, North America and Europe.","246":"Aug 21 (Reuters) - Brokerage Morgan Stanley has halted equity coverage on Tesla Inc, potentially a sign the U.S. bank may be doing business directly with the electric carmaker as it explores options to go private.

Tesla said it planned to resume normal operations on May 4, barring any significant changes, according to an email sent to U.S. employees by in-house counsel Valerie Capers Workman, which was viewed by Reuters.  The company, which suspended production at its San Francisco Bay Area vehicle and New York solar roof tile factories on March 24, said in the email the decisions were part of a broader effort to manage costs and achieve long-term plans.  Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The coronavirus pandemic has slashed U.S. demand for cars and forced several other automakers to furlough U.S. workers.  Pay for salaried Tesla employees will be reduced beginning on April 13 and cuts will remain in place until the end of the second quarter, the email said.  In the United States, workers\u2019 pay will be cut by 10%, directors\u2019 salaries by 20% and vice presidents\u2019 salaries by 30%. Comparable reductions will be implemented abroad.  Employees who cannot work from home and have not been assigned to critical work onsite factories will be furloughed, with workers maintaining their healthcare benefits until production resumes, the email said.  Tesla suspended production at both factories last month after it ended a standoff with authorities concerned about the spread of the coronavirus.  Tesla\u2019s sole U.S. auto factory employs more than 10,000 workers, with annualized production of slightly more than 415,000 units by the end of December 2019.  The suspension interrupts a planned ramp-up in production of its Model Y sport utility vehicle at the factory. Demand for the Model Y is expected to be higher than for all of Tesla\u2019s other models combined, Chief Executive Elon Musk has said in the past. The Model Y taps into strong demand for SUVs and is much less expensive than the high-end Model X.  Tesla on March 20 said it believed it had enough liquidity to successfully navigate the extended period of uncertainty, with some $6.3 billion in cash at the end of the third quarter, ahead of a recent $2.3 billion capital raise.  The company on Thursday surprised investors with strong first quarter delivery numbers despite the coronavirus outbreak hammering nationwide car sales and said Model Y production was ahead of schedule.","252":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O Chief Executive Elon Musk urged investors to approve the 2016 purchase of SolarCity at a big premium to its market value despite knowing the solar installer faced a cash crunch and publicly stating he had recused himself from involvement in the deal, according to court documents unsealed on Monday.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The filing was part of a lawsuit by Tesla shareholders alleging the company\u2019s board breached its duties to investors by approving the $2.6 billion acquisition of the struggling company, which was run by Musk\u2019s first cousins and of which he was a chairman and the largest stakeholder. The former SolarCity operations have been a drag on Tesla, with panel installations slumping since they were acquired.  Defendants asked the Delaware Court of Chancery judge to dismiss the case before it heads to a trial in March. Shareholder lawsuits that survive a motion to dismiss often settle before trial, which in this case might involve a payment to shareholders by Musk as well as money from directors\u2019 insurance.  Tesla rejected the allegations in an emailed statement, saying they were \u201cbased on the claims of plaintiff\u2019s lawyers looking for a payday, and are not representative of our shareholders who support our mission and ultimately voted in favor of the acquisition.\u201d  The suit represents another legal headache for Musk, the high-profile entrepreneur who settled a lawsuit by U.S. securities regulators last year over his use of Twitter and is being sued by for defamation by a British diver who said Musk falsely branded him a pedophile. Just last week, a Delaware judge ruled that Tesla must defend at trial Musk\u2019s multibillion-dollar pay package.  According to the filing, Musk was informed at a SolarCity board meeting in October 2015 that SolarCity needed to raise up to $300 million and was slashing its solar installation forecast for the year. The company issued $113 million in convertible notes a month later, of which Musk bought $10 million.  By February 2016, SolarCity management told the board its cash balances were forecast to drop below amounts required for a key line of credit for several months of the year. A default on that line of credit would trigger defaults on other debt instruments, the filing said.  Despite the bad news, Musk proposed the acquisition of SolarCity to the Tesla board later that month after a Lake Tahoe family vacation with his cousin, SolarCity Chief Executive and founder Lyndon Rive. SolarCity did not disclose the details of its liquidity concerns to investors.  At a meeting of Tesla\u2019s board on June 20, 2016, Musk advocated to fellow board members an initial acquisition price of $28.50 per share for SolarCity - a 30% premium to its market price - even though Tesla\u2019s financial adviser, Evercore, had recommended $25 to $27 a share.  The board ultimately approved an exchange ratio that represented a share price of $26.50 to $28.50 a share, though the offer was lowered later prior to the deal closing.  Tesla said Musk\u2019s meetings with Rive, his involvement in discussions about valuation, and all other material information were accurately described to shareholders in public filings before the deal closed.  Once Tesla made the offer for SolarCity on June 21, Musk publicly recused himself from the deal. But according to the filings he held frequent meetings with Evercore and pushed investors in a series of phone calls to support the purchase.  \u201cI could not be recused from all discussions ... I needed to voice my opinion, obviously,\u201d Musk said during questioning under oath by lawyers for the suing shareholders.  In the meantime, Musk assured Rive that he would \u201chave [him] covered\u201d with respect to cash needs until the acquisition closed as SolarCity \u201cwas running crazy close\u201d to its liquidity covenants, the documents said.  The companies said SolarCity accepted the offer on Aug. 1, 2016. The stock swap offer valued SolarCity at $25.37 a share, less than the initial proposal, and in line with the Evercore proposal. Shareholders approved the deal on Nov. 17.","253":"NEW YORK, Feb 26 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday ordered Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk to explain by March 11 why he should not be held in contempt for violating a settlement agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Construction of its first plant outside the United States began in January and production started in October. It aims to produce 250,000 vehicles a year after production of the Model Y is added in the initial phase.  The first 15 customers to get the cars on Dec 30 are Tesla employees, the company representative added.  The delivery date of Dec. 30 means that the plant will start delivering cars to customers just 357 days after the factory\u2019s construction started, which will mark a new record for global automakers in China.  The China-made cars are priced at 355,800 yuan ($50,000) before subsidies and Tesla has said it wants to start deliveries before Chinese new year beginning on Jan. 25.  The Shanghai plant is part of the Silicon Valley automaker\u2019s plans to bolster its presence in the world\u2019s biggest auto market and minimize the impact of the U.S.-China trade war.  The carmaker already treats China, the world\u2019s biggest electric vehicle market where 1.3 million new-energy vehicles were sold last year, differently than elsewhere, with offerings such as racing events and showroom parties.  It is also building service centers and charging stations across China to assure customers of standardized after-sales service, Reuters reported last month.  The Chinese government has also been supportive of the factory, which is China\u2019s first wholly foreign-owned car plant and a reflection of the government\u2019s broader shift to open up its car market.  The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on Friday said it had added Tesla\u2019s China-made Model 3 to a list of new energy vehicles exempt from purchase tax.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.  The news comes a day after Tesla temporarily suspended its Model 3 assembly line in what the company said was a planned pause, its second since February, to improve automation and address bottlenecks that have delayed production.  \u201cWe will be stopping for three to five days to do a comprehensive set of upgrades. This should set us up for Model 3 production of 3,000 to 4,000 per week next month,\u201d Electrek quoted Musk as saying.  \u201cAnother set of upgrades starting in late May should be enough to unlock production capacity of 6,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of June,\u201d he added.  Investors are closely watching to see if Tesla is able to meet long-delayed targets and quickly ramp up the Model 3, on which the company\u2019s future profitability rests. Tesla is pressured on a host of fronts after a fatality in one of its vehicles using its Autopilot system, a downgrade by Moody\u2019s, and a public spat between Musk and safety regulators.  Tesla\u2019s use of robots to assemble Model 3s has led to more complexity and delays, which Musk acknowledged last week in a tweet: \u201cExcessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated.\u201d  \u201cTesla\u2019s been trying to run full tilt,\u201d said Chaim Siegel, an analyst at Elazar Advisors, before Musk\u2019s letter was published. \u201cHe\u2019s sleeping overnight on the production floor. I don\u2019t think there is any way they\u2019d purposely want to slow production.

Tesla had previously targeted 2,500 Model 3s a week by the end of the first quarter and 5,000 by the end of the second quarter.  Missed deadlines threaten the money-losing company\u2019s credibility with the market and its ability to raise cash. Musk has said no new funds are needed this year, although many analysts dispute that.  Musk rallied employees in the letter, while warning departments or suppliers who missed the mark, saying they would need a \u201cvery good explanation\u201d and a plan for fixing the problem presented directly to him.  Shares of Tesla, which ended 1.2 percent lower on Tuesday, rose 1.4 percent in after-hours trading.","258":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk said late on Friday he would heed shareholder concerns and no longer pursue a $72 billion deal to take the luxury electric car maker private, abandoning an idea that stunned investors and drew regulatory scrutiny.  The decision to leave Tesla as a publicly listed company raises new questions about its future. Tesla shares have been trading well below their Aug. 7 levels, when Musk announced on Twitter that he was considering taking Tesla private for $420 per share, as investors wondered what this meant for Musk\u2019s ability to steer the company to profitability.  Musk and Tesla also face a series of investor lawsuits and a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the factual accuracy of Musk\u2019s tweet that funding for the deal was \u201csecured.\u201d  Musk said on Friday that his belief that there is more than enough funding to take the company private was reinforced during the process, but said he abandoned the bid based on feedback from shareholders and because the effort was proving to be more time-consuming and distracting than anticipated.  \u201cAlthough the majority of shareholders I spoke to said they would remain with Tesla if we went private, the sentiment, in a nutshell, was \u2018please don\u2019t do this,\u2019\u201d Musk wrote in a blog post.  Musk, who owns about a fifth of Tesla, said previously that he envisioned taking the company private without the standard method of a leveraged buyout, in which all the other shareholders would cash out and the deal would be funded primarily with new debt.  Musk estimated that two-thirds of Tesla shareholders would have chosen an option of \u201crolling\u201d their stakes into a private company. That would significantly reduce the amount of money needed for the deal and avoid further burdening Tesla, which has a debt pile of $11 billion and negative cash flow.  However, Musk said on Friday that a number of institutional shareholders explained that they have internal compliance issues that limit how much they can invest in a private company. He also said there was no proven path for most retail investors to own shares were Tesla to go private.  That contrasts sharply with an Aug. 7 tweet, when Musk said: \u201cinvestor support is confirmed.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: Tesla Motors Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk pauses during a news conference in Tokyo September 8, 2014. REUTERS\/Toru Hanai\/File Photo  T. Rowe Price Group, Fidelity Investments and Scotland\u2019s Baillie Gifford, which are top Tesla shareholders, declined to comment.  Musk also said previously that Saudi Arabia\u2019s PIF, which bought a stake in Tesla earlier this year of just under 5 percent, could help fund the cash portion of the deal, though sources close to the sovereign wealth fund had played down that prospect. PIF is in talks to invest in aspiring Tesla rival Lucid Motors Inc, Reuters reported last Sunday.  Six members of Tesla\u2019s board of directors said in a separate statement that they were informed on Thursday by Musk that he was abandoning his take-private bid. The board then disbanded a special committee of three directors it had set up to evaluate any offer that Musk submitted.  \u201cWe fully support Elon as he continues to lead the company moving forward,\u201d the board said.  However, some corporate governance experts said Musk\u2019s handling of the take-private bid could pressure the board to assert its independence and consider ways to rein him in by, for example, bringing in a chief operating officer.  \u201cThey have someone in charge who has raised serious doubts in the financial and public community about his ability to take the company forward. This will make it harder to invest\u201d in Tesla, said Charles Elson, director of the corporate governance center at the University of Delaware.  SHORT SELLERS EMBOLDENED  In explaining his reasons to take Tesla private earlier this month, Musk cited pressure from short sellers - investors who look to profit on bets that a company\u2019s stock will decline.  Some short sellers were emboldened by his U-turn. Christopher Irons, founder of investigative research website quoththeravenresearch.com, said it showed Musk was nowhere near as close to taking the company private as he had claimed.  \u201cPersonally, I\u2019m going to look to see how the stock opens on Monday. If it does not drop precipitously based on this, I will personally view it as an opportunity to add to my short position,\u201d said Irons, whose out-of-the money put options make money if Tesla\u2019s stock declines.  Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates, which has been shorting Tesla, said on Saturday: \u201cThe corporate governance disaster that is Tesla continues. Keep in mind that Musk informed the board on Thursday, according to his Friday night post.\u201d  Tesla shares closed at $322.82 on Friday.  One of Tesla\u2019s biggest challenges is ramping up production of its latest vehicle, the Model 3, which is critical to its profitability goals.  Musk has said repeatedly since April that Tesla has no need to raise new capital and has promised the company will be profitable and cash-flow positive in the third and fourth quarters.  However, Citigroup Inc analysts said earlier this month that if a go-private transaction is looking less likely, \u201cIt would be wise for Tesla to at least try to raise significant new equity capital sooner rather than later,\u201d so it can inspire investor confidence.","259":"FILE PHOTO: Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk dances onstage during a delivery event for Tesla China-made Model 3 cars in Shanghai, China January 7, 2020.

Straubel wants to build his startup Redwood Materials into the world\u2019s top battery recycling company and one of the largest battery materials companies, he said at a technology conference Wednesday.  Straubel aims to leverage two partnerships, one with Panasonic Corp 6752.T, the Japanese battery manufacturer that is teamed with Tesla TSLA.O at the Nevada gigafactory, and one announced weeks ago with e-commerce giant Amazon AMZN.O.  With production of electric vehicles and batteries about to explode, Straubel says his ultimate goal is to \u201cmake a material impact on sustainability, at an industrial scale.\u201d  Established in early 2017, Redwood this year will recycle more than 1 gigawatt-hours\u2019 worth of battery scrap materials from the gigafactory \u2014 enough to power more than 10,000 Tesla cars.  That is a fraction of the half-million vehicles Tesla expects to build this year. At the company\u2019s Battery Day in late September, Chief Executive Elon Musk said he was looking at recycling batteries to supplement the supply of raw materials from mining as Tesla escalates vehicle production.  Redwood\u2019s partnership with Panasonic started late last year with a pilot operation to recover materials at Redwood\u2019s recycling facilities in nearby Carson City, according to Celina Mikolajczak, vice president of battery technology at Panasonic Energy of North America.  Mikolajczak, who spent six years at Tesla as a battery technology leader, said: \u201cPeople underestimate what recycling can do for the electric vehicles industry. This could have a huge impact on raw material prices and output in the future.\u201d  Straubel\u2019s broader plan is to dramatically reduce mining of raw materials such as nickel, copper and cobalt over several decades by building out a circular or \u201cclosed loop\u201d supply chain that recycles and recirculates materials retrieved from end-of-life vehicle and grid storage batteries and from cells scrapped during manufacturing.  In September, Redwood said it received funding from Amazon\u2019s Climate Pledge Fund, following an investment by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, backed by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Microsoft founder Bill Gates.  \u201cI\u2019m excited about the work we can do together,\u201d Straubel said of Amazon. \u201cThey have batteries in many devices,\u201d from consumer electronics to data centers, as well as future electric delivery vehicles and drones.","261":"FRANKFURT, May 18 (Reuters) - Daimler will invest 500 million euros ($589 million) in Hambach, France, to start producing a small compact electric Mercedes-Benz in addition to its electric cars currently manufactured there for the Smart brand.

Boosted by demand for its mass-produced Model 3 sedans as overseas sales pick up, Tesla on Friday said it delivered 112,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter, including 92,550 Model 3s and 19,450 Model S\/X SUVs, which was above expectations of 104,960 vehicles, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

With a market valuation of more than $80 billion, Tesla is far outstripping those of traditional carmakers General Motors Co GM.N and Ford Motor Co F.N.  (Graphic: Tesla 2019 share movement click, )  The delivery results defy skeptics of Musk, whose mercurial behavior over the last two years came under close scrutiny from federal regulators and shareholders of Tesla.

In the electric vehicle maker\u2019s second-quarter earnings statement, published after the market close, Chief Executive Elon Musk said that he expected much of the car assembly plant to be \u201cfunded through local debt.\u201d  On the conference call following the earnings release he said: \u201cFor China I think our default plan will be to use essentially a loan from local banks in China and fund the (Gigafactory) in Shanghai with local debt.\u201d  The carmaker said in July that it had agreed with the Chinese government to manufacture vehicles in Shanghai, the first of its so-called Gigafactories to be built outside of the United States.  The capital expenditure cost of Gigafactory 3 is estimated to be $2 billion, Musk said on the conference call.  Tesla will need to raise debt because manufacturing challenges have left the company with a shortage of cash. Analysts said they believed Musk is turning to Asian markets because it is unlikely he would have been able to secure the sort of favorable terms from U.S. bond investors he did for his $1.8 billion junk bond, issued in 2017 with a 5.3 percent coupon.  \u201cGiven the Chinese new energy vehicle laws in place, I would expect the terms of the debt to promote an electric vehicle factory and battery factory to be more accommodating than the U.S. markets right now,\u201d said Jeffrey Osborne, managing director, sustainable energy and industrial technology at Cowen Inc.  Tesla has been burning cash as manufacturing problems have been thwarting its ability to meet production targets for its Model 3 sedan. The company on Wednesday said it would build up to 55,000 Model 3s in the current quarter at a positive gross margin, buoying hopes that it may meet its goal of profitability and positive cash flow in 2018.  Tesla ended the second quarter with $2.78 billion in cash after spending $610 million in capital expenses, while its negative free cash flow narrowed.  Vehicles produced at Gigafactory 3 would enable Tesla to meet Chinese demand, said Musk in a letter to investors on Wednesday. The first cars are expected to roll off the production line in about three years, with construction beginning in the \u201cnext few quarters.\u201d  Initial investment will not start in any significant way until 2019, he added.","269":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Thursday reached an agreement to settle a class action lawsuit with buyers of its Model S and Model X cars who alleged that the company\u2019s assisted-driving Autopilot system was \u201cessentially unusable and demonstrably dangerous.\u201d  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The lawsuit said Tesla misrepresented on its website that the cars came with capabilities designed to make highway driving \u201csafer.\u201d  The Tesla owners said they paid an extra $5,000 to have their cars equipped with the Autopilot software with additional safety features such as automated emergency braking and side collision warning.  The features were \u201ccompletely inoperable,\u201d according to the complaint.  Under the proposed agreement, class members, who paid to get the Autopilot upgrade between 2016 and 2017, will receive between $20 and $280 in compensation. Tesla has agreed to place more than $5 million into a settlement fund, which will also cover attorney fees.  The case has been closely watched in the automotive and legal communities, as it was the only known court challenge Tesla has faced with regard to its assisted-driving technology.  Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system has come under increased scrutiny in recent months after two Tesla drivers died in crashes in which Autopilot was engaged. The most recent crash, in March, is being investigated by safety regulators.  Tesla said in a statement it \u201cwanted to do right\u201d by its customers and, as part of the proposed deal, agreed to compensate car owners who had purchased the 2.0 version of Autopilot and \u201chad to wait longer than we expected\u201d for the driving features to become active.  \u201cSince rolling out our second generation of Autopilot hardware in October 2016, we have continued to provide software updates that have led to a major improvement in Autopilot functionality,\u201d the company said. Even though the settlement only covers U.S. customers, Tesla said it would compensate \u201call customers globally in the same way.\u201d  The proposed settlement does not mention the safety allegations but focuses on the delay in making the promised features available to consumers.  Steve Berman, a lawyer for the car owners, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The agreement, announced in a filing in San Jose federal court late Thursday, must be approved by U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman.  Autopilot, released in 2015, is an enhanced cruise-control system that partially automates steering and braking. Tesla has said the use of Autopilot results in 40 percent fewer crashes, a claim the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration repeated in a 2017 report on the first fatality, which occurred in May 2016. Earlier this month, however, the agency said regulators had not assessed the effectiveness of the technology.  The 2017 lawsuit in San Jose federal court named six Tesla Model S and Model X owners from Colorado, Florida, New Jersey and California who alleged the company had engaged in fraud by concealment, and had violated various state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.  They sought to represent a nationwide class of consumers.","270":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tesla Inc shares jumped more than 12 percent on Tuesday after long-time critic and short-seller Citron Research said it had a change of heart and is now betting the electric automaker\u2019s stock will rise.

Tesla will release third-quarter earnings after the market close on Wednesday, a week earlier than it has typically reported.  Chief Executive Elon Musk has promised a Model 3 ramp-up will help make Tesla profitable in the quarter, and has said the automaker should not have to sell more shares to raise cash.  But a number of Wall Street analysts say the ramp-up, added to other production promises and debt obligations, make some sort of capital raise likely.  Citron\u2019s change of opinion came just a month after the Andrew Left-led firm sued Tesla and Musk, saying Musk fraudulently engineered his abandoned plan to take the carmaker private to \u201cburn\u201d short-sellers. Citron said it was not withdrawing its lawsuit against Musk and Tesla.  Left told Reuters: \u201cI would not short this again. I understand that industry better and I think the company just turned the corner.\u201d  The reversal does not necessarily signal a broader capitulation by Tesla\u2019s other short-sellers.  Tesla short-sellers had been adding positions over the last week, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky of financial analytics firm S3 Partners, and the company has the second-biggest short interest behind Apple Inc.  Tesla announced record quarterly car production earlier this month but warned of major problems with selling cars in China due to new tariffs.  \u201cThe numbers coming out of the company are too compelling,\u201d Left said.

The list could include T. Rowe Price Group Inc and Fidelity Investments, which each have had a good run with the stock.  Some stockholders worry the meetings could yield details not available to smaller investors, a tension that is emerging more often as big funds own larger stakes in companies and stress their frequent talks with U.S. corporations.  Some small investors say they do not expect a level informational playing field when it comes to Tesla, whose shares have been whipsawed by Musk\u2019s unpredictable tweets.

Big funds speaking with Musk \u201care going to be getting the proverbial keys to the kingdom, and others are on the outside,\u201d Ahern said.  A Tesla spokesman did not comment for this article.

Rowe Price declined to comment. Neither firm has shared its thinking about Musk\u2019s take-private idea or said much to explain their second-quarter share sales. Collectively T Rowe funds cut their Tesla stakes by 24 percent to 11.9 million shares at June 30, while Fidelity funds cut their stakes 21 percent to 11.2 million at the same point, filings show.  Unlike index funds that would likely have to sell a privatized Tesla, both big firms run funds with big stakes in closely held companies.  To be sure, not all of Tesla\u2019s smaller investors are concerned about Musk sharing details selectively. Louis Albanese, managing partner of Catamount Wealth Management, with about 8,000 Tesla shares, said the key is that all shareholders eventually receive the same buyout offer, as he expects.  \u201cIt\u2019s not like these guys are going to get $420 (per share), and everybody else gets $350,\u201d Albanese said.","274":"BEIJING, May 31 (Reuters) - U.S. electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla Inc said on Friday it would price its China-made Model 3 vehicles from 328,000 yuan ($47,529), as it pushes production and sales in the world\u2019s largest new-energy vehicle market.  The carmaker has been building a factory in China since January where it will start producing Model 3 cars. Pre-orders for the vehicles will also start on Friday, the company said on its website.

The EQC, the first fully electric Mercedes car is shown at a presentation in Stockholm, Sweden September 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Esha Vaish  Daimler-owned DAIGn.DE Mercedes, BMW BMWG.DE and Volkswagen's VOWG_p.DE Audi and Porsche divisions are all gunning for the $52 billion Californian upstart, with early publicity efforts emulating its tech-industry halo.  The market for upscale electric cars is Tesla\u2019s to lose, with sales of its entry-level Model 3 sedan expected to reach about 50,000 cars this year and almost double that in 2019.  The Mercedes EQC - whose launch program in Stockholm features yoga in a direct appeal to the Millennials who have flocked to Tesla - is the first production model under the carmaker\u2019s electric EQ sub-brand. It will be closely followed by similarly hyped debuts for BMW and Audi.  \u201cWhile Tesla currently has a strong hold on the luxury electric market, I don\u2019t think this will be the case after the arrival of the German premium offerings,\u201d said Wajih Hossenally, an automotive powertrain analyst with IHS Markit.  \u201cTesla has virtually zero competition - but this will change from 2019 onwards.\u201d  Rival forecaster LMC Automotive agrees, predicting a steady decline in Tesla\u2019s share of an exploding electric-car market over the next decade, from today\u2019s 12.3 percent to 2.8 percent, even as its absolute sales continue to rise.  The Germans\u2019 combined market share will surpass Tesla\u2019s to reach 11.8 percent in 2020 before increasing further to about 19 percent three years later, according to its projections.  The new Mercedes, due to reach its first customers next year, will be priced close to the fuel-burning GLC to compete in the same bracket as Tesla\u2019s $49,000 Model 3, helped by its hotter-selling SUV form.  An affordable Model Y SUV is slated to join Tesla\u2019s high-end Model X crossover and Model S car, but not before 2020-21.  Electric vehicles: Sales forecast - tmsnrt.rs\/2PuORFo  Electric vehicles: market share forecast - tmsnrt.rs\/2PvahlT  Slideshow ( 3 images )  TECH BUZZ  The EQC softens its higher-riding proportions with sporty curves and a distinctive full-width rear light, while the interior resembles that of the Mercedes C-Class - a reminder of economies of scale that electric-only Tesla cannot match.  Well aware that their earlier battery-car offerings have failed to get anything like Tesla\u2019s level of public attention, the German brands are doggedly courting Silicon Valley-style buzz for the coming product blitz.  Executives including Mercedes Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche have taken to appearing in jeans and sneakers, responding to a broader tech-industry incursion into areas such as autonomous driving and connected services.  When it came to the EQC launch, Mercedes picked the city of Stockholm for its startup scene and green credentials, then began firing off teasers on Instagram as well as Twitter.  Like Tesla, Mercedes is announcing EQC orders in Norway even before its price. It has amassed more than 2,000 refundable deposits of 20,000 crowns ($2,400) in Europe\u2019s biggest electric-car market, where Tesla sold 8,500 vehicles last year.  The launch is the centerpiece of a three-day event that features DJ sets and yoga with a YouTube star - almost literally bending over backwards to telegraph 21st-century kudos.  Audi on Monday began production of its e-Tron SUV ahead of a Sept. 17 sales launch jamboree in San Francisco, just 40 miles from Tesla\u2019s Fremont assembly plant. It also plans to begin taking reservations backed by refundable $1,000 deposits.  The e-Tron is due in showrooms early next year, followed in 2020 by two more electric Audis and the Porsche Taycan sports car from its Volkswagen Group stablemate.  WOW FACTOR  Not to be outdone, BMW has hired a Lufthansa cargo jet to fly its electric Vision iNext - still just a concept car - from Munich to Beijing via New York and, of course, San Francisco. Events are planned in all four cities over five days.  In another Tesla-inspired move, the three German carmakers are developing their own network of fast-chargers along major highways in a partnership with Ford F.N.  While some experts doubt the Germans can ever match the wow factor around Tesla and its founding boss Elon Musk, many also wonder whether they need to.  \u201cGerman manufacturers have highly desirable, fun-to-drive premium cars in their DNA,\u201d said Nicolai Mueller, a McKinsey partner based in Cologne. \u201cThat\u2019s a very good starting point.\u201d  Tesla used its powerful tech aura to persuade early adopters to pay a premium for an all-electric car from a relative unknown, with no quality track-record or physical dealerships for servicing and support.  But the German carmakers have a century of manufacturing behind them, with sterling brands, well developed global sales networks and an existing customer base in the millions.  BMW\u2019s i3 mini and an earlier Audi e-Tron failed to shift large volumes, but the electric-car market has matured since. LMC sees China driving global sales growth above 50 percent annually as the German offensive gets underway in 2019-20.  By then the Model S flagship will be eight years old. Musk, by tweeting then withdrawing plans to take Tesla private, has sharpened doubts about the company\u2019s ability to keep expanding and updating its lineup.  \u201cTesla is potentially facing a product shortfall starting in 2020,\u201d Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois warned investors in a note last week.  Tyler Martin, a Tesla owner in Tucson, Arizona, said he had yet to decide whether to buy a Model 3 next - after his current Model S suffered from \u201cbuild quality\u201d issues requiring several trips to the repair shop each year.  One big question is whether competitors can offer a viable alternative to Tesla\u2019s proprietary fast-charging network, the 28-year-old software entrepreneur said.  If they can, Martin added, \u201cI would definitely consider another brand.\u201d","276":"(Reuters) - Shares of Tesla TSLA.O tumbled 7% in extended trade on Friday after the electric car maker was excluded from a group of companies being added to the S&P 500, among them Etsy, whose stock market value is less than a 20th of Tesla's.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Tesla is seen at a branch office in Bern, Switzerland March 25, 2020. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  The decision by S&P Dow Jones Indices is a blow to Tesla investors who widely expected the company to join the benchmark stock index after a blockbuster quarterly report in July cleared a major hurdle for its potential inclusion.  S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a statement it was adding online craft seller Etsy ETSY.O, semiconductor equipment maker Teradyne TER.O and pharmaceutical technology company Catalent CTLT.N to the S&P 500, effective Sept. 21, and removing H&R Block HRB.N, Coty COTY.N and Kohls KSS.N.  Shares of Etsy jumped 6% in extended trade, Teradyne rose 2%, and Catalent added 2%.  S&P Dow Jones Indices senior index analyst Howard Silverblatt declined to say why Tesla was not added to the S&P 500, which is tracked by index funds with at least $4.4 trillion in assets.  \u201cThe market is continuously changing, and we need to reflect that in our indices,\u201d Silverblatt said.  With a market capitalization over $370 billion, Tesla is one of the most valuable companies on Wall Street. Even after a 16% drop in its share price from record highs this week, Tesla remains more valuable than 95% of the S&P 500's existing components, including Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N and Procter & Gamble PG.N.  Etsy, Teradyne and Catalent have a combined stock market value of about $40 billion.  Tesla, which is up nearly 400% so far in 2020, is among the most loved - and hated - stocks on Wall Street. It is the U.S. stock market\u2019s highest-profile bet on the rise of renewable energy and the decline of fossil fuels, and Tesla\u2019s Model 3 sedan has made major inroads among consumers.  Its recent stock gains have been driven by Tesla\u2019s unexpectedly strong quarterly results released in July, as well as by bets that it would be added to the S&P 500, which would trigger massive demand for its shares from index funds that track the benchmark.  Tesla bears point to looming competition from Porsche PSHG_p.DE, General Motors GM.N and other longer-established rivals. They are also skeptical of Tesla\u2019s corporate governance under Chief Executive Elon Musk, who in 2018 agreed to pay $20 million and step down as chairman to settle fraud charges.  Short sellers are betting $24 billion that Tesla\u2019s shares will fall, among the largest short levels on record for a U.S. company, in dollars, according to S3 Partners.","277":"April 4 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc shares fell more than 8 percent on Thursday after a bigger-than-expected drop in first-quarter deliveries, led by waning demand for its luxury Model S and X vehicles, added to worries about the electric carmaker\u2019s finances.  At least four Wall Street brokerages cut their price targets on the company\u2019s stock, citing concerns about profitability and revenue after deliveries of the higher-priced luxury cars more than halved compared to the fourth quarter.  RBC analysts called Model S\/X deliveries \u201cvery disappointing\u201d and estimated the numbers would translate to a more than $1 billion shortfall in revenue compared to previous estimates.  The company had already flagged in February that it expected to post a first-quarter loss as it launched its cheaper $35,000 version of the Model 3 sedan.  In the quarter, Tesla delivered 50,900 Model 3s, the linchpin of its growth strategy, falling short of analysts\u2019 estimates of 58,900, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Tesla also pinned the blame for the first-quarter delivery drop to longer transit times, which analysts said could impact cash flow, even though the company claimed it had sufficient cash on hand.  The company said it had delivered only half of the quarter\u2019s numbers by March 21, with 10,600 vehicles still in transit at the end of the quarter. By comparison, only 1,900 vehicles were in transit at the end of the fourth quarter.  Cowen and Co analysts said that the delivery and transit details suggested \u201ccash was likely dangerously low\u201d after Tesla paid off a $920 million convertible bond obligation in cash in the beginning of March.  Still, there were no new downgrades by brokerages on Tesla shares. The company is currently rated \u201cbuy\u201d or higher by 12 of the 30 brokerages covering the company, 7 \u201chold\u201d and 11 \u201csell\u201d or lower.  The carmaker reaffirmed its forecast to deliver between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles this year, and said U.S. orders for the new Model 3 outpaced what the company was able to fulfill in the quarter.  Nord LB analyst Frank Schwope called the numbers \u201cmore shocking than disappointing\u201d and said there remain doubts whether Tesla could deliver 400,000 cars this year.  Lawyers for Tesla chief Elon Musk will argue on Thursday that he did not violate a fraud settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and should not be held in contempt, the latest twist in a high-profile battle between the billionaire and the government.  Musk\u2019s fight with the SEC, to play out in a Manhattan federal court hearing, has raised investor worries that it could lead to restrictions on his activities or even his removal from Tesla, while distracting him at a pivotal point in the company\u2019s expansion. (Reporting by Vibhuti Sharma in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)","278":"BEIJING\/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - New models will help electric vehicle sales in China zoom this year, after tepid business in a virus-riddled 2020, and analysts predict Tesla\u2019s Model Y pricing will emerge as a major disruptor in the world\u2019s biggest car market.  Tesla Inc, which became the world\u2019s most valuable car maker last year, started selling locally made Model Y SUVs in China this month, for almost a tenth less than gasoline-powered luxury cars with similar market positioning.  It set the starting price at 339,900 yuan ($52,376), or 10% below official prices of Daimler\u2019s Mercedes GLC, BMW\u2019s X3 and Audi\u2019s Q5L - all locally made gasoline sport utility vehicles (SUVs) with similar size and positioning.  \u201cThe pricing will disrupt the conventional premium cars market and shatter the traditional belief that the cost of an electric vehicle (EV) should be higher,\u201d said Cui Dongshu, secretary general at China Passenger Car Association (CPCA).  The Tesla Model Y pricing - that analysts say will be the price to beat - and new models from others such as Mercedes and BMW will help drive up demand in China, which also accounts for almost half of global EV sales.  Sales in China of so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs), which include battery electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell cars, are expected to grow 30-40% to around 1.8 million units in 2021, according to its top auto industry body China Association of Automobile Manufacturers and analysts.  NEV sales likely rose only 8% last year to 1.3 million, lagging a government target for annual sales to reach 2 million by 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic forced people indoors and eroded demand in the first few months of the year.

REUTERS\/Tingshu Wang\/File Photo  China\u2019s decision to extend EV subsidies by two years, instead of phasing them out by end 2020, will also underpin demand in 2021. Beijing wants NEVs to account for 20% of its overall auto sales by 2025, versus about 5% now.  Stricter rules in some cities to promote greener vehicles and reduce air pollution are expected to force urban customers to buy EVs too, according to Yale Zhang, head of the Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight.  MORE MANUFACTURING  Betting on growing demand, NEV makers such as homegrown Nio Inc and Xpeng Inc as well as foreign players, such as Tesla, are expanding manufacturing capacity.  Tesla is expected to make \u201caround or over half a million\u201d vehicles in China this year, with around 20% earmarked for international exports, industry sources with knowledge of Tesla\u2019s orders to suppliers said.  That represents a big increase from 2020, when Tesla produced around 150,000 cars, analysts said.  Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Tesla\u2019s China website shows customers who place Model Y orders now need to wait until the second quarter for delivery.  It is offering the same financing tools to customers for the Model Y as it does for the Model 3 sedan that allow buyers to pay only 10% of the cost upfront when they get the car.  Tesla\u2019s Model 3, which it has been making in China for over a year, is also seen chipping away at the dominance of Daimler, Audi and BMW in the conventional premium auto sector.  Shanghai-made Model 3s outsold similarly positioned and more expensive Audi\u2019s A4, BMW\u2019s 3-series and Mercedes C-class in November, data from CPCA shows.  \u201cCompetitive pricing is the key,\u201d CPCA\u2019s Cui said.

Until now, the automaker had not given a date for when its first electric pickup truck would hit the market.  Pickup trucks are one of the most profitable vehicle segments in the world. The U.S. market is dominated by GM, Ford Motor Co F.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MIFCAU.N.

GM\u2019s Barra spoke on the same day that Tesla was expected to give details about its long-anticipated pickup truck model.

Last month, Musk described the Tesla pickup as \u201ccloser to an armored personnel carrier from the future.\u201d  Analysts have said they expect the Tesla pickup to debut in late 2021 or early 2022.  Separately, startup Lordstown Motors Corp said on Thursday it is now accepting pre-orders for its electric pickup truck, the Endurance, for $52,500 before tax credits.  The truck is due to go on sale in the fourth quarter of 2020.  The company, which is 10% owned by Workhorse Group Inc WKHS.O, recently bought GM's shuttered Lordstown Assembly plant in Ohio.

Analysts at Daiwa Capital Markets said that value translated into a total lithium hydroxide procurement amount of 63,000-88,000 tonnes, or 12,600-17,600 tonnes per annum.  In May this year, Yahua put a 20,000 tonnes per year lithium hydroxide plant in Yaan city into operation, more than doubling its previous capacity, even as oversupply and the impact of COVID-19 on lithium demand pushed prices to multi-year lows.

Tesla Inc investors gave a rare rebuke to iconoclastic Chief Executive Elon Musk on Wednesday after he cut off analysts asking about profit potential, sending shares down 5 percent despite promises that production of the troubled Model 3 electric car was on track.  Tesla\u2019s future depends on the Model 3 and the company said that it had largely overcome production bottlenecks, with Musk vowing a dramatic turnaround that would reverse losses and generate positive cash flow in just a few months.  Musk plans to shut down its Fremont, California factory for 10 days in the second quarter but said Tesla will meet the production target of 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of June, as planned, and will turn a profit in the second half of the year.  To achieve profitability, Musk will have to reverse what today amounts to a $22,584 pre-tax loss per vehicle built by the Silicon Valley company. Tesla posted its biggest-ever quarterly loss when it announced first-quarter results on Wednesday.  Tesla stock was little changed after the earnings announcement but fell during a conference call, when Musk began cutting analysts\u2019 questions short, costing Tesla over $2 billion in market capitalization.  \u201cThese questions are so dry. They\u2019re killing me,\u201d Musk said after an analyst asked what percentage of Tesla 3 reservation holders have started to configure options for their cars, an indicator of how much profit Tesla will be able to wring from the vehicles. Another analyst asked about a capital requirement before being cut off.  He then took several questions in a row about plans for a self-driving car network and other long-term projects from the host of a YouTube channel focused on investing, praising the questions as not boring.  5,000 MODEL 3s PER WEEK  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Musk\u2019s ability to run Tesla is crucial as the company strives to efficiently and profitably build its first vehicle intended to be produced at high volume, the Model 3.  Musk acknowledged error recently in over-automating the Model 3 assembly-line, which has resulted in production delays, but it is still unclear how long and costly it will be to unwind this mistake.  Delayed Model 3 production also comes as a slew of competitors bring new electric vehicle models to market.  The company stood by a previously announced target of building 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of June.  Tesla's capital expenditures declined in the quarter and the company cut its spending forecasts for 2018, saying it would spend less than $3 billion. Tesla spent $3.4 billion in 2017. (bit.ly\/2jn15SB)  Investing.com analyst Clement Thibault said the reduction was noteworthy, \u201cbut in the long run given challenges that lay ahead of Tesla, I don\u2019t think it is going to make or break the company.\u201d  Tesla \u201cis definitely not in a minimizing cost stage,\u201d Thibault said.  Free cash flow, a key metric of financial health, widened to negative $1 billion in the first quarter from negative $277 million in the fourth quarter, excluding costs of systems for its solar business. Analysts had not expected so much spending, predicting hundreds of millions of dollars less in so-called cash burn, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Tesla did not break out a cash flow calculation that it had included in previous quarters.  The niche carmaker, which two years ago vowed to build 500,000 vehicles annually in 2018, has attracted legions of fans for its advanced technology and design. But the company rushed its Model 3 to market, making mistakes in manufacturing whose effects are now being felt, and investor skepticism has risen.  Questions over Tesla\u2019s finances are top of mind, and many analysts anticipate a capital raise in 2018 despite Musk\u2019s statements that it will not be necessary due to profitability and positive cash flow in the third or fourth quarters.  Tesla said gross margins on the Model 3, which today are slightly negative, would be close to flat in the second quarter and grow to \u201chighly positive\u201d in the second half of the year.  Tesla said it produced 2,270 Model 3s per week in the last week of April. It said net reservations for the Model 3, including configured orders not yet delivered, exceeded 450,000 at the end of the first quarter.  Automotive revenue rose only 1 percent from the prior quarter to $2.74 billion.  RECORD LOSS  Tesla reported a record loss of $709.6 million, or $4.19 per share, for the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a loss of $330.3 million, or $2.04 per share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, Tesla had a loss of $3.35 per share. Analysts had expected a loss of $3.58 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  The company said it ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash after spending $655.7 million in quarterly capital expenses.  The lack of Model 3 revenue has exacerbated Tesla\u2019s cash burn as the company continues to spend on its assembly line and prepares for new investments on multiple projects in the pipeline, such as the Model Y crossover and its Gigafactory.  The Model Y is just one of many projects in the pipeline for Tesla, which also launched a Tesla Semi and a new Roadster in recent months.

REUTERS\/Charles Platiau  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk is making Tesla\u2019s board more sustainable. On Thursday the electric-car maker unveiled Hiromichi Mizuno as its newest director. Until last month he was the investment chief of Japan\u2019s $1.5 trillion Government Pension Investment Fund, the world\u2019s largest. That experience alone will be valuable to Tesla. But it\u2019s the clout that Mizuno developed and wielded in environmental, social and governance issues during his five-year stint at GPIF that will serve the manufacturer and its shareholders best.  Mizuno\u2019s views on short sellers will have appealed to Musk, who is fond of berating or goading such players. Mizuno in December stopped lending the pension fund\u2019s global equities to short sellers, arguing the strategy doesn\u2019t fit with ESG-enlightened investing.  His appointment is far more important, though, for the stronger oversight he should bring to Tesla. Powering electric cars may be cleaner than running their internal combustion engine counterparts, but making vehicles is still a dirty process that can be improved. And there are social concerns, too: workers at the company have complained about issues from racism to safety.  Where Mizuno may have the most impact, though, is on Tesla\u2019s governance. The board has been too supine over the years, acquiescing in everything from overly ambitious production targets to Musk calling a cave diver a \u201cpedo\u201d, or announcing on Twitter in August 2018 that he might take the company private.  That last flub, at least, prompted a board shake-up. As part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over the tweets, Musk had to appoint an independent chairman, as well as two new board members. One of the latter, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison was already a Tesla investor and describes himself as a \u201cvery close friend\u201d of Musk. All in, seven of what was until Thursday a nine-member board either have some ties to Musk or were present and ineffectual during his more controversial episodes.  Adding Mizuno won\u2019t quite even that out. But the ESG heavyweight is at least unlikely to take any of Musk\u2019s antics lying down.

That enforcement trend, according to four experts, could benefit Tesla as the company faces an SEC investigation of CEO Elon Musk\u2019s Aug. 7 tweet about \u201csecured\u201d financing for a private buyout of the company.  \u201cI expect Tesla to pay zero,\u201d said Georgetown law professor Urska Velikonja, who is engaged in an ongoing analysis of SEC enforcement trends against companies and individuals.  SEC Chair Jay Clayton has emphasized accountability for individual wrongdoers, rather than holding corporations responsible for employees\u2019 misconduct.  Even if the commission ultimately concludes Musk\u2019s tweet was unfounded, the Tesla CEO\u2019s potential penalty would probably be less than $200,000, according to two securities law professors and a defense lawyer who tracks SEC enforcement at the SEC Actions blog.  Tesla declined to comment on the experts\u2019 assessment of potential exposure to the SEC.  Lawyers from Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz, which represents Tesla CEO Musk, did not immediately respond to an email request for comment. The SEC declined to comment.  SHARP DROP IN PENALTIES  Last year, Georgetown\u2019s Velikonja documented a sharp drop in total penalties assessed by the commission after Clayton took over as chairman. This year \u2013 Clayton\u2019s first full year as SEC chair \u2013 the decline is even more notable.  According to Velikonja, the agency has assessed about $592 million in monetary penalties in cases settled in the first 10.5 months of fiscal year 2018, which ends next month. Those are the lowest aggregated SEC penalties in at least a decade, Velikonja said. The previous low, according to the Georgetown professor, was $656 million over the same 10.5 month-period in fiscal year 2012.  The drop in penalties reflects the SEC\u2019s pivot away from the quasi-prosecutorial role it adopted after big financial frauds in the 2000s.  \u201cThe Clayton administration is trying to bring the agency back to its roots in civil enforcement,\u201d said securities defense lawyer Stephen Crimmins of Murphy & McGonigle. \u201cThe focus is on putting in place structural changes\u201d to avert future misconduct, according to Crimmins.  The commission has also emphasized penalizing individual wrongdoers rather than corporations, on the theory that shareholders should not bear the cost of their own deception. As a company, said Michigan law professor Adam Pritchard, Tesla issued a \u201cmeasured and responsible\u201d statement after Musk tweeted his go-private plan.  \u201cTesla should not and won\u2019t be sanctioned,\u201d Pritchard said.  What about Musk himself?  The full story behind Musk\u2019s tweet about the financing of a buyout is not publicly known, though Tesla on Monday posted a blog entry in which the CEO said he was referring to funding assurances from the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund.  Defense lawyer Crimmins said SEC investigators will likely look for documentary evidence and testimony to back or refute Musk\u2019s assertion that he reasonably believed the Saudi fund would finance his contemplated buyout.  SEC investigations can take years but Crimmins said this inquiry seems straightforward and could be concluded quickly.  Thomas Gorman, a securities defense lawyer at Dorsey & Whitney who authors a blog about SEC enforcement, said the facts that have already emerged make it unlikely the SEC will bring a case against Musk.  \u201cNOT THE STUFF OF GOVERNMENT ACTION\u201d  \u201cWhile one might select better language if the sentence was wordsmithed, that (tweet) is not the stuff of a government enforcement action,\u201d Gorman said.  If the SEC does conclude Musk\u2019s tweet was misleading, three experts said, his penalty will probably be a relatively paltry amount - less than $200,000.  That amount could be higher, according to Crimmins, if the commission determines Musk\u2019s tweet was fraudulent, not merely negligent.  The SEC has so far targeted 63 individuals for reporting violations in fiscal year 2018, according to Velikonja\u2019s analysis. They have paid on average a $75,000 penalty.  Federal regulations permit the SEC to seek up to $160,000 from individuals for each securities violation. The SEC has in the past devised ways to multiply violations to increase penalties but defense lawyer Gorman and law professors Velikonja and Pritchard said the commission would probably count Musk\u2019s tweet as a single violation if it determined the assertion of secure funding to have been misleading.  \u201cThe value of the case for the SEC is sending a message,\u201d said Velikonja. \u201cThis would be the SEC saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to go after the biggest guys. We\u2019re not afraid of Elon Musk.\u2019\u201d  The commission can also seek injunctions. The most extreme punishment the SEC can impose is a prohibition on serving as an officer or director of a public company. Experts do not expect such a draconian penalty in the Tesla case, especially, according to Crimmins, because Musk is so integral to the company\u2019s prospects.  But if the commission finds a violation, the SEC could enjoin Musk and Tesla from future misleading communications. That sort of prohibition, said Michigan prof Pritchard, would mean more severe consequences for subsequent breaches of securities law.  The SEC can even insist that Musk and Tesla agree to vet future market-moving tweets with securities lawyers before they\u2019re posted, according to Crimmins.  \u201cThat would be an elegant solution,\u201d he said.","285":"April 13 (Reuters) -  * \u201cYES, EXCESSIVE AUTOMATION AT TESLA WAS A MISTAKE. TO BE PRECISE, MY MISTAKE. HUMANS ARE UNDERRATED\u201d Further company coverage:","286":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) on Wednesday cited driver errors and Tesla Inc\u2019s Autopilot design as the probable cause of a January 2018 crash of a Model S into a parked fire truck on a highway in California.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The safety board, which previously criticized Tesla\u2019s driver assistance system Autopilot after a 2016 fatal crash in Florida, said that the system\u2019s design \u201cpermitted the driver to disengage from the driving task\u201d in the Culver City, California, crash. The NTSB said on Tuesday that Autopilot allowed the driver to keep his hands off the wheel for the vast majority of the nearly 14 minutes of the trip.  The fire truck was unoccupied and the driver was not injured in the incident. The NTSB cited the driver\u2019s \u201cinattention and overreliance\u201d on the advanced driver assistance system.  Tesla\u2019s Autopilot was engaged during at least three fatal U.S. crashes, including one involving a 2018 Model 3 in Delray Beach, Florida, and a crash in Mountain View, California, of a Model X. Both incidents, which occurred in March 2018, remain under investigation by the NTSB and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The NTSB makes safety recommendations, while the NHTSA can order a recall if it deems a defect poses an unreasonable risk to safety.  The Center for Auto Safety, a consumer watchdog group, said on Wednesday the NTSB report should prompt NHTSA to \u201cdo its job and recall these vehicles ... A vehicle that enables a driver to not pay attention, or fall asleep, while accelerating into a parked fire truck is defective and dangerous.\u201d  NHTSA did not immediately comment.  Tesla said in an emailed statement that since the 2018 crash \u201cwe have made updates to our system including adjusting the time intervals between hands-on warnings and the conditions under which they\u2019re activated.\u201d  The company added that Tesla owners have driven billions of miles with Autopilot engaged and says its data \u201cindicates that drivers using Autopilot remain safer than those operating without assistance.\u201d  The crashes raised questions about the driver-assistance  system\u2019s ability to detect hazards and sparked safety concerns about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.  After the fatal 2016 Florida crash, NTSB asked six automakers with advanced driver assistance systems - Tesla, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, BMW AG, Nissan Motor Co, Daimler AG and Volvo Car - to \"develop applications to more effectively sense the driver's level of engagement and alert the driver when engagement is lacking while automated vehicle control systems are in use.\"  \u201cAll manufacturers except Tesla have responded to the NTSB explaining their current systems and their efforts to reduce misuse and keep drivers engaged,\u201d the NTSB said.  While Tesla drivers say they are able to avoid holding the steering wheel for extended periods while using Autopilot, Tesla advises drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention while using the system.  The 2014 Model S Autopilot system was engaged continuously for the final 13 minutes 48 seconds of the January 2018 trip and the driver kept his hands off the wheel for all but 51 seconds of the final drive segment and received numerous alerts to place his hands back on the wheel, the NTSB said. Had he been paying close attention \u201che could have taken evasive action to avoid or mitigate the collision.\u201d","287":"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea\u2019s LG Chem, an electric car battery supplier for Tesla Inc and GM said on Thursday it plans to separate its battery business into a new company as the electric vehicle market takes off.  The move came after LG Chem swung to a profit in its car battery business in the latest quarter. It expects further profitability thanks to growing demand from European car makers and more sales of cylindrical batteries used in Tesla cars.  LG Chem, South Korea\u2019s top petrochemicals maker, has long bet on car batteries as a new growth engine, but it has never made an annual profit in the business since it started making them about a decade ago.  But expectations are growing for its car battery business as automakers push for more electric vehicles, fuelled by Tesla\u2019s rise and tougher emissions regulations in Europe.  LG Chem said the timing was right to separate the business, which competes with China\u2019s CATL and Japan\u2019s Panasonic, as it has started to make \u201cstructural profits\u201d in its car battery business.  LG Chem said the new business, to be launched in December, aims to achieve a revenue of 30 trillion won ($25.5 billion) or more in 2024, from an expected revenue of 13 trillion won this year.  The new wholly owned subsidiary, tentatively named \u201cLG Energy Solutions,\u201d will include LG Chem\u2019s small batteries used in smartphones and laptops and its energy storage systems, as well as its car batteries.  LG Chem shares slumped 5.4%.  \u201cMany LG Chem investors will only indirectly hold the battery business, which will be separated into a unit,\u201d Daeshin Securities analyst Han Sang-won said.  He also said investors are also taking profits ahead of Tesla\u2019s battery day, in which Tesla may unveil its advanced battery technologies.  LG Chem said it will consider a stock market listing of the battery unit, without elaborating further.  Making the unit an independent company would also help attract investments to the business, which requires heavy capital expenditure to expand production capacity as orders pile up, LG Chem said.

Zach Kirkhorn, Tesla\u2019s vice president of finance, will replace Ahuja, who is about 56 years old.  Chief Executive Elon Musk touted strong demand for the Model 3, as the company begins to ship the car to Europe and Asia from its Fremont, California factory. But he acknowledged it was paramount to cut costs to lower the price of the vehicle for a wider customer base.  \u201cWe have to be relentless about costs in order to make affordable cars and not go bankrupt,\u201d said Musk on a conference call with analysts.  While the company expressed optimism that it could post a profit in the first quarter despite fewer deliveries of its flagship S and X vehicles, Tesla warned of challenges such as logistics and global deliveries of its new Model 3.  Tesla said plans to lower the price of the Model 3 were contingent on quickly building its factory in China. It hopes to produce 500,000 vehicles a year there by the last quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020, a goal it originally expected to meet in 2018.  To start, the Shanghai factory will build 3,000 Model 3s per week, while production at Tesla\u2019s Fremont plant will rise to 7,000 Model 3s per week by year\u2019s end, the company estimated.  \u201cBottom line is we need the Shanghai factory to achieve that 10,000 rate and have the cars be affordable,\u201d Musk told analysts. \u201cThe demand for Model 3 is insanely high. The inhibitor is affordability.\u201d  Musk announced a 7 percent workforce reduction earlier this month, saying it was crucial to cut costs to roll out a lower-priced, yet still profitable, Model 3.  The cheapest today is priced at $44,000. Musk gave a \u201crough guess\u201d that Tesla would begin building its originally promised $35,000 version around the middle of this year.

Starting from $39,900, the Cybertruck is less expensive than initially flagged but its polarizing design could limit sales in a popular segment symbolic of a rugged, practical American lifestyle.  At a launch event in Los Angeles, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said other versions will be priced at $49,900 and $69,900 with the most expensive offering a range of more than 500 miles (800 km). By comparison, the current maximum range of a Tesla car is 370 miles for its long-range Model S sedan.  Production is expected to begin around late 2021.  Made from ultra-hard stainless steel which Musk claimed was bulletproof, the four-door six-seater truck\u2019s sharp geometric body was set atop massive tires. Its tinted windows were made from armored glass, while a single strip of white light wrapped around the truck\u2019s front, replacing headlamps.  \u201cTrucks have been the same for a very long time, like 100 years,\u201d he said, as an audience of Tesla fans chuckled at a slideshow of pickup truck designs throughout the decades. \u201cWe need something different.\u201d  Musk\u2019s assertion that the Cybertruck\u2019s exterior \u201cwon\u2019t scratch and dent\u201d appeared to be borne out after it was hit with a sledgehammer.  But in a snafu that invited much mockery online, the armored glass windows cracked like spider webs when metal balls were thrown at them. \u201cRoom for improvement,\u201d Musk said, although he noted the glass had not completely broken.  The truck marks the first foray by Tesla, whose Model 3 sedan is the world's top-selling battery electric car, into pickup trucks, a market dominated by Ford Motor Co's F.N F-150, along with models by General Motors Co GM.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MIFCAU.N.  But analysts said its design meant the Cybertruck was unlikely to become more than a niche product and as such would have little impact on energy sustainability as Musk touted in his presentation.  \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s a truck for (Musk) and his friends in Silicon valley, not necessarily Joe the plumber who needs the truck to run his plumbing business,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst at automotive consultancy Edmunds.  The design of the truck, which can accelerate from 0-60 miles an hour in 2.9 seconds, was partly influenced by the Lotus Esprit sportscar that doubled as a submarine in the 1970s James Bond film \u201cThe Spy Who Loved Me\u201d as well as by the movie Blade Runner.

Ford has never had to offer incentives on the model, which costs in the high $60,000 range, according to Ford spokesman Mike Levine. Ford also offers the more expensive F-150 Limited, its most powerful and luxurious pickup.  Some analysts said they were concerned Tesla might not be able to deliver on its promised base price for the Cybertruck, given that it will be made from the same stainless steel to be used in the SpaceX Starship rocket and which could make it hard to keep a lid on production costs.  Ford and GM are also gearing up to challenge Tesla more directly with new offerings like the Ford Mustang Mach E electric SUV as well as electric pickups.  Ford aims to sell an electric F-series in late 2021, sources familiar with the plans said. GM plans to build a family of premium electric pickup trucks and SUVs, with the first pickup due to go on sale in the fall of 2021.  In April, Ford invested $500 million in startup Rivian, which plans to build its own electric pickup beginning in fall 2020.  Electric pickups and SUVs could help Ford and GM generate the significant EV sales they will need to meet tougher emission standards and EV mandates in California and other states.  The Trump administration is moving to roll back those standards, but electric trucks are a hedge if California prevails.  Demand for full-size electric pickup trucks in the near term may not be huge, however.  Industry tracking firm IHS Markit estimates the electric truck segment - both full- and mid-sized models - will account for about 75,000 sales in 2026, compared with an expected 3 million light trucks overall. The Tesla truck is not part of that estimate.","294":"FILE PHOTO: A Tesla Model X electric car is seen at Brussels Motor Show, Belgium, January 9, 2020.

If the accidents pile up, though, Tesla itself is sure to be brought into a legal fight, insurance industry experts said.  The incidents highlight a shifting landscape for long-held assumptions about auto insurance and accident blame as more car manufacturers offer features that can automate parallel parking, avoid collisions, and take over steering during traffic, among other things.  A Tesla software update last week added a so-called Smart Summon feature for some customers. When the car is within 200 feet and in their line of sight, they can use a phone app to summon the vehicle in a parking lot. Users start the car by holding down a button and stop the car by releasing it, Tesla said in instructions, warning users to be careful.  U.S. regulators are looking into parking lot crashes involving Tesla cars driving themselves to their owners, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Wednesday.  \u201cThis was an interesting one to explain to my insurance,\u201d wrote one user in YouTube and Twitter video posts of a Tesla scraping against a garage door frame while exiting in summon mode. \u201cSilly feature cost me time and money.\u201d  Tesla did not respond to a request for comment but Chief Executive Elon Musk on Wednesday tweeted that there were more than 550,000 Smart Summon uses in the first few days.  Insurance claims for such incidents will go through the car owner\u2019s traditional auto coverage, said Jennifer Dukarski, a lawyer in Ann Arbor, Michigan, who represents automotive suppliers in disputes about safety and autonomous car technology.  \u201cBut as the number of incidents build, you\u2019ll find someone who will entertain a class action dealing with a product defect,\u201d Dukarski said.  Automated features also raise the question of whether the owner or the auto manufacturer is at fault when accidents occur.  \u201cThe rationale for the owner being responsible is that the laws have not caught up to autonomous vehicles,\u201d said Keith McKenna, an insurance lawyer in New York who represents corporate policyholders.  If fully-automated cars someday becomes the norm, liability will shift to manufacturers and their insurance, McKenna said.  The technology is not sophisticated enough to be deemed \u201cdriverless\u201d under California\u2019s motor vehicle rules, the California Department of Motor Vehicles said, essentially leaving the app user outside of the car responsible for accidents.  Still, limitations to the app and other features make Tesla more responsible when accidents occur, said Mike Morgan, a Florida personal injury lawyer. His firm sued Tesla last year on behalf of a client who blames Tesla for his car crashing into a disabled vehicle.  \u201cYou are still responsible for your car and must monitor it and its surroundings at all times and be within your line of sight because it may not detect all obstacles,\u201d Tesla said in instructions for the new feature.  But it may be too late to avoid a crash when a user attempts to stop the car, Morgan said.  \u201cThese vehicles provide a false sense of human control,\u201d Morgan said.","297":"(Reuters) - When Tesla Inc TSLA.O reports second-quarter results after the bell on Wednesday, investors will be keen to see whether the electric carmaker has delivered a profit during the global pandemic that has sunk most of its internal combustion rivals deep in red ink.

On average, they expect an adjusted 11 cents loss per share and a net loss of $240 million, according to Refinitiv data. More bullish investors have sent Tesla\u2019s shares soaring in recent weeks and made it the world\u2019s most valuable automaker.  Tesla\u2019s April-June results also have wider ramifications. A profit would mark the company\u2019s first cumulative four-quarter net income, a goal it must accomplish to be added to the S&P 500 index, where it would be among the most valuable companies.  Some analysts have said that failing to reach that goal could send Tesla shares plummeting after they surged more than 275% so far this year.  Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, in the meantime, has poked fun at the company\u2019s naysayers and those who placed bets against him with short positions in the stock, by launching a limited edition of red satin \u201cshort shorts.\u201d  Earlier this month, Tesla surpassed expectations when it announced it had delivered more than 90,000 vehicles in the quarter, significantly beating analyst estimates and running counter to the wider auto industry trend.  But while vehicle deliveries increased 2.5% on a quarterly basis, production dropped nearly 20%, clouding the outlook for the company that had predicted it would deliver at least 500,000 vehicles by the end of the year, Investors have been closely following any revisions of that target.  Tesla\u2019s U.S. vehicle factory was shut for some six weeks during the second quarter on local regulators\u2019 orders. The company has ramped up production at its new Shanghai factory and sold more than 29,600 vehicles in China during the second quarter.  But as global unemployment remains high and the economic outlook uncertain, many consumers are expected to hold off on larger purchases, including vehicles.  Nord LB analyst Frank Schwope expects global auto production and sales to collapse by 15% to 25% worldwide in 2020, but said Tesla might be more insulated as its buyers remain committed.  Tesla plans to build a second plant in the U.S. Southwest as soon as the third quarter. It has not announced a location, but Texas and Oklahoma have been vying for the plant, which promises to create at least 5,000 jobs.","298":"FILE PHOTO: SpaceX owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk arrives on the red carpet for the automobile awards \"Das Goldene Lenkrad\" (The golden steering wheel) given by a German newspaper in Berlin, Germany, November 12, 2019.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Tesla Inc, struggling with delay in delivery of its higher-priced Model S and X luxury cars, said on Tuesday it will bring back lower-priced options for those cars and roll out upgrades to improve their driving range and re-charging speed.  The company, striving to improve margins and post a profit later this year, has laid off workers including about half of the team hired to deliver cars in the United States, and said it would close stores to lower costs.  Tesla has since said it will keep higher-volume stores open, while announcing a 3 percent price increase on some models.  The upgrades include a new drivetrain design and a new adaptive suspension system, increasing each vehicle's driving range, the company said in a blog post here ahead of its first-quarter results on Wednesday.  With the upgrades, the long-range version of Model S and X can now travel 370 miles (595.5 km) and 325 miles, respectively, on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cycle.  The lower-priced options, or the \u2018standard range\u2019 versions, of Model X and Model S were available for purchase on Tesla\u2019s website after Tuesday\u2019s announcement for $83,000 and $78,000, respectively. Estimated delivery of both cars was set for May.  Earlier in April, Tesla reported fewer-than-expected vehicle deliveries in the first quarter, with figures for the Model S sedans and Model X SUVs more-than-halving compared with the preceding quarter.  The Silicon Valley carmaker has faced a range of challenges over the past year as one of the leaders in electric vehicle technology sought to ramp up production, deliveries and sales of the Model 3 sedan seen as crucial to its long-term profitability.","300":"* Volkswagen readies mass production of electric cars  * VW to make 330,000 electric cars in Zwickau by 2021  * VW retooling China plants to make 600,000 electric cars  * VW set to become world No. 1 EV producer by 2025 -analyst  *  By Edward Taylor, Jan Schwartz and Joseph White  FRANKFURT\/ZWICKAU, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG is ramping up production of electric cars to around 1 million vehicles by end of 2022, according to manufacturing plans seen by Reuters, enabling the German carmaker to leapfrog Tesla Inc and making China the key battleground.  Volkswagen is readying two Chinese factories to build electric cars next year. The Chinese plants will have a production capacity of 600,000 vehicles, according to Volkswagen\u2019s plans, which have not been previously reported - revealing VW\u2019s ability to industrialise production faster than other pioneers in the electric vehicle market.  Tesla is still trying to reach its goal of making more than 500,000 cars a year by building a new factory in Shanghai, China, while VW can rely on an established workforce in two of its plants in Anting and Foshun to build zero-emission cars.  The scale and speed of VW\u2019s electrification push marks a shift in favour of established manufacturers that can use existing factories and profit from combustion-engined sport utility vehicles (SUVs) to scale up faster than startups.  \u201cThe truth is barriers to entry in autos remain high,\u201d said Max Warburton, an analyst at Bernstein Research. \u201cMaking cars is hard. The move to electric vehicles will be expensive, but will probably be led by traditional manufacturers.\u201d  VW is leveraging its large infrastructure of suppliers, factories and workers, long a handicap to its profitability, more aggressively than rivals BMW, Renault SA , General Motors Co and Tesla, which were all quicker to sell a custom-designed electric car.  Rather than adjusting production gradually, and using multi-powertrain platforms, Volkswagen is making a massive bet on a dedicated electric vehicle architecture, known as MEB, in the hope of increasing economies of scale sufficiently to push down the price of electric cars to around 20,000 euros ($22,262).  The Wolfsburg, Germany-based carmaker is retooling eight plants across the globe by 2022 to specialise in manufacturing electric cars, and license its electric MEB platform to rivals, senior VW executives told Reuters, putting it on track to become the world\u2019s largest maker of zero-emission vehicles.  Tesla has emerged as a serious competitor with a credible car, its Model 3, Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess told Reuters last week. But startups have a hard time entering mass production without sufficient production facilities, he said.  \u201cThe question is, can you expand your production quickly enough? The capital intensity is increasing,\u201d Diess said.  To fund its own electrification shift, the German carmaker aims to increase sales of VW SUVs, with combustion engines, to 40% of overall sales by 2020 from 23% in 2018.  The powerstation that supplies energy for VW\u2019s flagship e-vehicle factory in Zwickau, Germany, marked by two tall chimneys, was built to power production of the combustion-engined Volkswagen Golf.  Now Zwickau can piggyback off this infrastructure to ramp up production to 330,000 VW ID electric cars by 2021.  Volkswagen Group will increase economies of scale by rolling out electric vehicle platforms to its Audi, Skoda and Seat and Porsche brands.  Volkswagen Group will be in a position to build 22 million electric cars by 2028, of which 11.6 million could come out of Chinese factories, VW said.  PRODUCTION PAIN  VW\u2019s expansion push comes at a time when investors have started to question businesses delivering growth without real profit, a change in sentiment that is crippling the ability of several electric car pioneers to raise more cash.  Back in 2016, Tesla said it wanted to build more than 500,000 Model 3 cars by 2018, a goal it has failed to meet. This year it expects to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars, a target that includes selling all models.  Tesla\u2019s struggles have dampened optimism about how easy it is to enter the car business, making it harder for China\u2019s NIO, backed by internet company Tencent Holdings Ltd, as well as others like Faraday Future and Byton Ltd, to fund the next stage of growth: capital-intensive volume production and sales.  \u201cSo much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you.\u201d  After starting trial production runs at its factory in Shanghai, Tesla now hopes to reach its 500,000-vehicle target in the 12-month period ending June 30, 2020. Tesla is also looking for a site to start production in Europe.  Volkswagen is converting two German plants, Hanover and Zwickau, to build electric vehicles and will retool other factories including plants in China: Foshan which VW runs together with its joint-venture partner FAW-Volkswagen, and another in Anting, which VW runs together with SAIC.  It will retool plants in Emden and Dresden in Germany, Mlada Boleslav in the Czech Republic, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, in United States, as part of a 30 billion-euro ($33.24 billion)investment push into e-mobility by 2023.  As a result, Volkswagen Group will be the No. 1 electric vehicle producer globally by 2025, while Tesla is likely to remain a niche player, according to UBS autos analyst Patrick Hummel.  TECHNOLOGY INTERLOPERS  The cutthroat rivalry between automakers and software companies started when Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google presented a prototype autonomous vehicle in 2012, leading analysts and industry executives to fear a so-called Nokia moment. This occurs when a new player from the tech sector unveils a superior design, in the way that Apple Inc presented the iPhone in 2007, ending Nokia\u2019s dominance of the mobile handset business. Today, Tesla\u2019s cars are generally perceived as cutting-edge and potentially more sophisticated than VW\u2019s. Volkswagen\u2019s ID.3, which starts production this year, has an operating range of between 330 and 550 kilometers (205 to 341 miles), below the 560 km long-range Model 3 version offered by Tesla.  That is because Tesla has a sophisticated software algorithm to control how much electricity goes to the electric motor, air conditioning, seat heaters, in-car infotainment, and cooling system.  Volkswagen\u2019s edge is more blunt: price and massive economies of scale.  The ID.3 has a starting price of under 30,000 euros ($33,363) in Germany. By contrast, Tesla\u2019s Model 3 had an average selling price of $50,000 in the second quarter. The long-range version retails for 52,390 euros in Germany.  The VW vehicle\u2019s lower price comes from the carmaker\u2019s ability to place large orders which, by nature of their size, help drive down the price. Volkswagen is investing 50 billion euros ($55.5 billion) to buy battery cells and will also license its MEB electric car platform to rival carmakers to further increase economies of scale.  That is, Volkswagen will make that huge investment if suppliers can keep up.  \u201cThere is a lot of investment,\u201d Stefan Sommer, Volkswagen Group\u2019s board member responsible for procurement, told Reuters last month. \u201cBut even the big companies like Samsung, CATL, LG Chem, the big guys, SK, they hesitate to take so much money and invest because they are not seeing the market on the other side.\u201d  \u201cWe are now seeing the first battery plants, LG in Poland, CATL in Germany, they don\u2019t have the skilled workforce. That will be the bottleneck,\u201d Sommer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a learning curve everybody has to work through. This will cause some lags in supply. We have no other choice.\u201d  VW plans to license its electric MEB vehicle platform to rival Ford Motor Co, which will give VW $10 billion in revenue over the next six years.  Thomas Ulbrich, Volkswagen\u2019s member of the board who oversees production of electric vehicles, told Reuters, \u201cFord and Volkswagen\u2019s agreement will be a blueprint for further licensing deals.\u201d  In the short term, Volkswagen and its Chinese joint venture partners will invest 15 billion euros to produce 15 different electric cars for China alone by 2025.  \u201cThe first MEB-based vehicle is an SUV model,\u201d Volkswagen said about its China push.

A go-private deal at $420 a share announced by Musk in an Aug. 7 tweet would have wiped out short bets against Tesla and hidden the company\u2019s financials from the public eye.  But Musk\u2019s abrupt Friday announcement that he was dropping his plan and media reports of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) probe into his tweets have galvanized Tesla bears.  \u201cIt\u2019s such a ridiculous situation,\u201d said Brodie Ferguson, a 25-year-old Canadian whose interest in Tesla stems from watching videos about Musk\u2019s other engineering ventures.  \u201cIt\u2019s ... energized our skepticism,\u201d Ferguson, who said he has a bearish options position on Tesla shares, told Reuters via Twitter.  Ferguson is only one of thousands of Tesla bears who use Twitter to crowdsource financial data, photos, satellite imagery and video footage of Tesla facilities to shed light on the company\u2019s production and sales figures to support their view that the stock is overvalued.

Musk later apologized.  To keep tabs on Tesla inventory, @Latrilife monitors California lots where he said Tesla cars are kept before being shipped to distribution centers and posts the footage on Twitter.

Others use drones to gather footage of Tesla production facilities, scour Tesla\u2019s financial filings and pore over Musk\u2019s statements for inconsistencies.  Musk\u2019s Aug. 7 tweet that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d for the deal and a subsequent New York Times interview in which he described his critics as \u201csmartish\u201d sparked a frenzy of online lampoons of the 47-year-old billionaire CEO.  Short-sellers said all eyes will now be on mounting litigation against Tesla, the progress of the SEC probe, and Tesla\u2019s cash flow and debt.  Slideshow ( 7 images )  East Coast-based small business owner Paul Shust, who told Reuters he uses information posted on $TSLAQ FinTwit and has an options bets against Tesla, said he was so upset by Musk\u2019s Aug. 7 tweet that he wrote to SEC Commissioner Kara Stein that day, according to an email seen by Reuters.  Stein\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. The SEC has not commented on Musk\u2019s tweets.  Loss-making Tesla told investors earlier this month that it expects to show a profit in the third and fourth quarters and has reiterated that it does not plan to seek new capital from shareholders, something Wall Street analysts have questioned.  NO SHORT SQUEEZE  Wall Street is broadly divided on Tesla. Of 27 analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S, 10 have hold ratings on the stock, nine recommend buying and eight recommend selling.  Tesla is the most short-sold stock in the United States, with investors betting around $10.18 billion that the company\u2019s shares will fall, according to financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners.  Short-sellers borrow shares and then sell them, hoping to buy them back at a lower price and pocket the difference.  Musk has mocked short-sellers and called some of their allegations lies, while also saying their hostility has taken a toll on him and the company.  \u201cThe biggest risk short-sellers pose to Elon and the stock price is putting information out there,\u201d said Paul Huettner, who works for a Chicago-based advisory firm and said he took out options betting against Tesla after it missed its Model 3 production targets last year.  He focuses on crowdsourcing information on departures of Tesla executives and litigation relating to the company.  \u201cNo short-seller is preventing Elon from building cars,\u201d Huettner added.  Short-sellers are not alone in scrutinizing Tesla. Analysts at Switzerland\u2019s UBS hired engineers to pull apart a Tesla Model 3 to understand its production costs. The bank currently has a \u201csell\u201d rating on the stock.  While Tesla shares spiked the day of Musk\u2019s Aug. 7 tweet, they have since fallen around 9 percent as concerns grow over Musk\u2019s leadership. The dip has generated more than $942 million in paper profits for short-sellers, according to S3 Partners.","302":"A flagstore shop of electric carmaker Tesla is pictured in Berlin, Germany, November 13, 2019.

Last week Tesla told some holders of Model 3 reservations that they would not get their cars until 2019, eliciting howls of complaint on Tesla online fan forums. Tesla declined to comment.  GM dealers in California, the top U.S. market for electric vehicles, say brisk demand for Bolts is driven in part by frustrated Tesla buyers who are afraid they will lose a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit if they wait. The tax credit drops in value and eventually disappears once Tesla sells 200,000 electric vehicles in the United States, which Edmunds analyst Jeremy Acevedo expects Tesla to hit by the fall.  Tesla\u2019s Model 3 production troubles give rival auto makers a chance to snatch customers. Tesla has said that the net number of refundable $1,000 reservations for Model 3s was stable late last year and grew in recent weeks, with hundreds of thousands in line. But some buyers are running out of time or patience.  Chevrolet dealer Yev Kaplinskiy said his dealership located between San Francisco and Silicon Valley sold 15 Bolts last weekend, after Tesla\u2019s latest delay.  \u201cWe\u2019re getting the Tesla people who wanted their Model 3,\u201d Kaplinskiy said. \u201cWe ask them, \u2018What other cars are you interested in?\u2019 They\u2019re mostly Tesla. But they want the car now. They don\u2019t want to wait.\u201d Some of the weekend buyers had turned to Chevy because of the most recent Tesla delay, he said.  Chevrolet sent an email to some prospective buyers this week, announcing in bold case, \u201cBolt EV: Now available.\u201d  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The Bolt and Model 3 both start at about $35,000 and can travel more than 200 miles (322 km) on an electric charge, although the Tesla and its Chief Executive Elon Musk have received much more media attention.  While Tesla is struggling with production of the Model 3, GM sold 23,297 Bolts in 2017, with monthly sales mostly rising. Kelley Blue Book reported that Bolts are in relatively short supply as measured by days in inventory, which fell to 42 in January from a high of 65 in August. By comparison, the Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T Leaf, an electric car with shorter range, was in inventory for 202 days.  For a graphic on 2017 Bolt sales, click here: reut.rs\/2sxeVt9  Last Wednesday, some of those who made early reservations for the base version Model 3 received emails from Tesla saying their vehicles would not be delivered until early 2019, delayed from 2018.  \u201cI\u2019m feeling extremely fleeced by Elon - guy secured an interest free loan from me (reservation payment) for a car I hadn\u2019t seen before reserving, and just told me that it might be another year before I should receive it,\u201d wrote one person from Seattle, \u201c206er\u201d, who was among a handful on TeslaMotorsClub.com saying they were cancelling reservations after the new delay.  Reuters was unable to contact the posters or confirm that they were cancelling reservations.  \u201cMy objective...was always a $35,000 Tesla for the price of a decently optioned Civic (with full federal tax credit),\u201d 206er added.  Tesla is closing in on 200,000 U.S. electric vehicle sales thanks to the popularity of its luxury Model S sedan and Model X SUV. If it hits 200,000 U.S. electric vehicle sales in the third quarter, then the $7,500 tax credit would phase out in stages over 2019. GM also is getting close to the limit, having sold nearly 170,000 plug-in cars, including Bolts, Volts and others, through the end of last year, Green Car Reports estimated.  Sonoma Chevrolet General Manager Ken Scholl, said the subsidy had been a key draw for Bolts and a concern for those who had given up on a Tesla. \u201cIf I had 50 (Bolts) in December, we would have sold every one,\u201d he said.","306":"* S&P 500 flat after string of higher closes  * Bitcoin hits another record  * Spot gold rises (Updates prices throughout, adds European stocks close)  NEW YORK, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Global equity indexes were near unchanged on Tuesday, while bitcoin climbed to another all-time peak, extending gains in the wake of an endorsement from Tesla Inc.

REUTERS\/Joe Skipper  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk has put the board of Tesla on the spot. The $52 billion electric-car maker\u2019s chief executive on Sunday sent a tweet suggesting, without evidence, that one of the men involved in rescuing 12 Thai boys and their soccer coach from flooded caves was a pedophile. Such a gratuitous and potentially libelous act deserves punishment. The trouble is, Tesla\u2019s directors may be reluctant to mete it out.  The nine-member board is packed with Musk\u2019s allies. One of them is his brother, Kimbal. Lead independent director Antonio Gracias runs a private-equity fund Musk has backed and was a director at another of Musk\u2019s firms, SolarCity, before Tesla bought it in 2016. Others have connections to Musk\u2019s SpaceX venture.  And neither Tesla nor SpaceX has yet decided what to do with director Steve Jurvetson, on leave from both after his own venture-capital firm, DFJ, ousted him last November during an investigation into personal misconduct.  Even with a different board, there\u2019d still be a big problem: Musk\u2019s and Tesla\u2019s fortunes are essentially symbiotic. If his future were in question, the money-losing company would probably find it hard to raise capital, explain away missed deadlines and everything in between.  Musk\u2019s prominence also narrows down the board\u2019s options. Firing him for his \u201cpedo guy\u201d tweet could precipitate a crisis of confidence among investors. Unlike the eventual ouster of Travis Kalanick at privately held Uber, for a capital-hungry public company that might prove terminal.  Directors could consider stripping him of either the chairman or chief executive title. Or they could dock his compensation. KB Home boss Jeffrey Mezger lost a quarter of his bonus last year after a vulgar rant at neighbor Kathy Griffin. Removing 25 percent of what Musk could earn under his ambitious 10-year bonus package could deprive him of a potential $15 billion payout.  At the very least the board should require him to apologize and perhaps swear off Twitter. To do nothing would send a worrying message: that directors are unwilling or unable to rein in Musk\u2019s more troubling traits. Most shareholders may still be unfazed for now \u2013 the stock was only down around 3 percent by Monday afternoon.

On Wednesday, Musk strayed from the usual Q&A protocol with analysts that cover the electric car company and fielded more than a dozen straight questions from YouTube investment channel owner Galileo Russell, who had previously recommended buying Tesla shares on his HyperChange TV.

Tesla stock was on track for its biggest daily slump in two years as Wall Street questioned Musk\u2019s ability to lead the electric car maker. Investors also were worried about reports that regulators were pressuring Tesla\u2019s directors for details about how much information he shared with them.  Musk stunned markets last week with a tweet that he was considering taking Tesla private for $420 per share and that he had secured funding. The SEC has opened an inquiry related to his tweets, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.  The Times reported that efforts were underway to find a No. 2 executive to take pressure off Musk, who has struggled with production issues for Tesla\u2019s key Model 3 sedan and has been criticized for behaving erratically on Twitter.  \u201cThis past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career. It was excruciating,\u201d Musk said in the hour-long interview, in which he reportedly choked up more than once.  Musk also said he had no plans to relinquish his dual role as chairman and CEO. He said he was girding for \u201cat least a few months of extreme torture from the short-sellers, who are desperately pushing a narrative that will possibly result in Tesla\u2019s destruction.\u201d  With $11 billion worth of shares sold short, Tesla is the most shorted U.S. company, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm. On Twitter, Musk has frequently complained about short sellers and taunted them.  \u201cIf your plan is to take this company private, out of the public eye and the regulatory eye of the SEC, then people who have a fiduciary responsibility to their investors have to feel comfortable about the situation, and the New York Times article makes that harder,\u201d said Mike O\u2019Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.  The day's drop in Tesla's stock shaved $5 billion off its market capitalization, but still left it about $1 billion above General Motors' GM.N $51 billion stock market value.  Money-losing Tesla has been burning through cash as it has aggressively ramped up Model 3 production, a process Musk has called \u201cproduction hell\u201d. Tesla bulls are counting on Musk to exponentially raise production, leading to long-term profits.  \u201cEveryone is reacting to the interview that Musk gave, where it seemed like he was an exhausted, frustrated individual,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel, which does not own Tesla shares. \u201cThere is concern about the long-term strength of the company, perhaps even its viability if he\u2019s not able to be a strong leader.\u201d  Analysts at UBS this week questioned the profitability the Model 3, in a report that said Tesla could lose $6,000 on every base model.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of German carmaker Volkswagen is seen on a rim cap in a showroom of a Volkswagen car dealer in Brussels, Belgium July 9, 2020. REUTERS\/Francois Lenoir  The ID.4\u2019s driving range is less than Tesla\u2019s Model Y electric compact SUV, which offers more than 300 miles (483 km)between charges.  But Volkswagen is hoping to offset that by offering the ID.4 at a lower price than Tesla\u2019s Model Y. Customers can further benefit from federal and state electric vehicle subsidies for which Tesla no longer qualifies.  The ID.4 will initially come at a price of $39,995 and will be about $5,000 less expensive once the company begins building it in the United States, Volkswagen said.  By comparison, Tesla\u2019s Model Y is priced at $49,990, the Model X SUV comes at a price of $79,990 and its lowest-priced Model 3 sedan is $37,990. Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Tuesday said he is aiming to build a $25,000 electric car, but that is three years away.  The ID family is an integral part of the Volkswagen brand\u2019s ambitious plan to build 1.5 million electric vehicles a year by 2025. In the U.S. market, the ID.4 also is aimed at getting Volkswagen back on the shopping lists of consumers turned off by the brand\u2019s diesel emissions cheating scandal.  The ID.4 will be the first electric compact SUV that can sell for about $35,000 - aiming at a high-volume segment and the average price level of vehicles sold in the U.S. market, Volkswagen of America chief Scott Keogh told Reuters.  \u201cWe want volume,\u201d Keogh said.  Combined with three years of free charging on its Electrify America network, Volkswagen dealers will be able to offer the ID.4 for thousands of dollars less than a typical Tesla Model Y.  \u201cWe wanted to make sure not only do we have sufficient range, but do we have the price point?\u201d Keogh said.  The ID.4 launch will also test Volkswagen\u2019s U.S. dealers. The automaker is asking them to invest in charging stations and other infrastructure, and trying to build online selling capability for electric vehicles.  The ID.4, which will be assembled in the United States starting in 2022, is part of a family of electric vehicles expected to include a reincarnation of VW\u2019s popular Microbus van.  \u201cI want a volunteer army, not a draft army,\u201d Keogh said, describing his message to dealers at a meeting in Chattanooga, Tennessee, last November. Nearly all of VW\u2019s U.S. dealers have agreed to make the required investments, he said.  John Luciano, head of Volkswagen\u2019s U.S. dealer council, said that dealers who take advantage the automaker\u2019s subsidies for advertising costs can offset investments in charging infrastructure and other equipment.  \u201cIf you really pay attention, you can do it at almost no cost,\u201d said Luciano, who owns Volkswagen and Toyota stores in Amarillo, Texas.  \u201cHow many will I sell?

Tesla Inc TSLA.O has stood by safety claims for its Model 3 in the face of regulatory scrutiny, while documents showed the top U.S. automotive safety watchdog issued at least five subpoenas since last year seeking information about crashes involving the company's vehicles.  Tretyakov said was driving at around 100 km (62 miles) per hour -- the speed limit -- when the car crashed on its left side into the stationary tow truck that he had not noticed.  Footage of the incident on state TV channel Rossiya 24 showed the car by the side of the road engulfed in flames and thick black smoke. Two small explosions occurred within a few seconds of each other and the metal frame of the vehicle was all that remained after the fire, TV footage showed.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam\/File Photo  Under a major tax overhaul passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress late last year, incentives in the way of tax credits that lower the cost of electric vehicles are available for the first 200,000 such vehicles sold by an automaker. The tax credit is then reduced by 50 percent every six months until it phases out.  In July, Tesla said it delivered 200,000 electric cars to buyers in the United States, meaning tax credits will now begin to be lowered while rivals such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW AG and Audi AG will bring electric models to the market with a full tax credit in place.  Buyers of electric cars get full tax credit for the quarter in which the company hits the 200,000 delivery mark and the next, according to Internal Revenue Service regulation bit.ly\/2NxwsXn.  This means Tesla has until the end of the year to hand out full tax credits, which could invite a further rush of orders and hit the company\u2019s already strained production and delivery chain.  Tesla has scrambled to deliver the Model 3 - a mass-market sedan that it hopes is the key to success - and many customers have been waiting since early 2016.

Tesla\u2019s plan to issue shares and convertible debt comes after the company repeatedly pushed back forecasts for turning a profit. The company faces expensive challenges, including launching production in China, overhauling its U.S. retail and service operations and developing new models, including the high-volume Model Y SUV and a Semi commercial truck.  Many analysts had calculated that Tesla - which burned through $1.5 billion in the first quarter - would not be able to carry out its growth plans without new cash.  \u201cThe market seems to be breathing a sigh of relief. Now they need to get back to work, and start selling more cars,\u201d said Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin.  Shares of Tesla rose 4.3% to close at $244.10, while the yield on Tesla\u2019s existing $1.8 billion junk bond fell to its lowest level in over a month.  \u201cThis is how they pay for the factory in China, the Model Y, their 2020 goals, said Ross Gerber, chief executive of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki.  Raising $650 million in new shares and $1.35 billion in debt, while giving underwriters the option to buy an additional 15 percent of each offering, could potentially raise the proceeds to $2.3 billion.  Chief Executive Officer Musk would also pitch in $10 million of his own money, Tesla said in a filing.  For over a year, Musk had insisted that the money-losing Silicon Valley automaker had no need for a capital raise, saying that high Model 3 volume and efficiency would push the company to profit in all quarters of 2019. That changed with a $702 million loss in the first quarter, and warnings that profit would be delayed until the latter half of the year.  Raising capital should not be a substitute for operating effectively, Musk said last month, suggesting that a capital raise could be near. \u201cIt\u2019s healthy to be on a Spartan diet for a while,\u201d he said.  Before Tesla\u2019s announcement on Thursday, however, analysts speculating about a capital raise had cautioned that the company had missed optimal timing - last year\u2019s third quarter, when the company posted a profit.  Tesla has reported four profitable quarters since it went public in June 2010.  The company has made a series of moves to rework pricing strategies for its cars following the reduction of a $7,500 federal tax credit for Tesla buyers by half, a decline that hurt first-quarter deliveries.  Musk also has been distracted by a public feud with U.S. regulators. Shares in the company have dropped 28% since the beginning of the year.  LOWER COUPON  Tesla ended its first quarter with $2.2 billion in cash. In 2019, it expects capital expenditures of $2 billion to $2.5 billion and about $2.5 billion to $3 billion annually for 2020 and 2021.  Throughout its history, Tesla has raised funds through bank loans, equity sales, convertible notes, a junk bond sale, securitization of its vehicle leases and solar asset-backed notes.  Convertible bonds, which permit an issuer to repay creditors in new stock rather than cash if certain conditions are met, have been among Tesla\u2019s most preferred vehicles for raising capital. They typically allow a borrower to raise capital at a lower interest rate than an ordinary bond because the investor has the potential for a greater return should the conversion terms be met.  The convertible notes announced on Thursday are seen carrying a coupon rate of between 1.5% and 2.0% with a conversion premium of between 27.5% and 32.5% over the reference price for Tesla shares at the time of the sale, according to a trader who saw preliminary marketing materials for the deal.  The convert is being marketed with a higher conversion premium than its last convertible bond, issued in March 2017, meaning Tesla shares will have to rise by an even larger magnitude to trigger a conversion to equity.  Tesla\u2019s last convert was a $977.5-million security maturing in March 2022 that featured a 2.375% coupon with a 25% conversion premium to the stock\u2019s reference price of $262 per share at the time of the sale. That bond can be converted to equity at a price of $327.50 per share, which is currently around 36% above Tesla\u2019s current share price of around $240.  In March, Tesla had to repay a $920 million convertible in cash because the stock failed to reach the conversion price of around $360 per share. Only one of the convertibles it or its Solar City unit have issued has met the terms for conversion.  The yield on Tesla\u2019s existing $1.8 billion junk bond fell to its lowest level in over a month at just over 8 percent on Thursday after the news, roughly 2.7 percentage points above its 5.3% coupon.  Goldman Sachs and Citigroup will manage the offering. BofA Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank Securities, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse are the additional book-running managers.  Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have $507 million in outstanding personal loans to Musk, with his Tesla shares put up as collateral, according to Thursday\u2019s prospectus. If Tesla\u2019s stock falls, the banks could force him to sell some of those shares. Tesla\u2019s previous prospectus in 2017 showed Musk had $624 million in personal loans from banks, backed by his shares.  In a sign of Wall Street\u2019s concern about Tesla, Goldman Sachs recommended selling Tesla shares in an April 25 report, putting a 12-month price target of $200.","318":"(Adds more details from blog)  May 25 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Friday announced a number of key executive hires including former GE and General Motors executive James Zhou as its China CFO and Neeraj Manrao, a former Apple executive, as director of energy manufacturing.

The company\u2019s shares were down $19 at $282 in premarket trading. The stock has lost more than a quarter of its value since touching a high of $389.61 in September, mainly due to reports of bottlenecks around its Model 3 production.  \u201cInvestor feedback to the call was shock that a CEO would be dismissive and the general sentiment was that the defensiveness spoke volumes,\u201d said RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak, who lowered his price target on Tesla shares 8 percent to $280.  In a note titled \u201cThe Importance of \u2018Boring\u2019 Questions,\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s Jonas called into question Tesla\u2019s financial standing.  \u201cWhile they may be \u2018dry\u2019 in nature, we argue such questions are extremely important for a highly-levered and cash-hungry company,\u201d Jonas said.

Free cash flow, a key metric of financial health, widened to negative $1 billion in the first quarter from negative $277 million in the fourth quarter, excluding costs of systems for its solar business.  Musk had said Tesla does not need to raise cash this year.  Tesla has raised capital each year since its initial public. offering and issued debts twice in 2017.  The company plans to reach its weekly goal of producing 5,000 Model 3 cars in two months, after revising the target several times.  Tesla\u2019s use of robots to assemble Model 3s has led to more complexity and delays, which Musk acknowledged last month.  \u201cWe believe that Tesla is essentially learning how to become a manufacturing company on the fly,\u201d said Spak. \u201cWhile we don\u2019t have meaningful reason to doubt that Tesla can eventually achieve its targets, doing so in a timely manner without some growing pains could prove challenging.\u201d (Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Anna Driver)","320":"SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Tesla is making Elon Musk a lot richer without paying him a dime.  A blistering stock rally has bolstered the value of CEO Musk\u2019s 19% stake in the electric car maker by $16 billion since the start of 2020, to $30 billion.  Tuesday\u2019s steep climb in the share price could sweeten Musk\u2019s payday under his record-breaking compensation package, which is built on stock options that rely on market value targets. Two milestones have now been achieved that could see Musk unlock options worth $1.8 billion.  The controversial chief executive, who is also the majority owner and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, recently testified that he did not have a lot of cash as he successfully defended himself in a defamation lawsuit. He previously has taken loans using his Tesla shares as collateral.  Musk does not take a salary, choosing instead a risky options package that envisions the stock market value of Tesla rising to $650 billion over 10 years, a prospect that was derided by some investors when the deal was announced in 2018.  That target now looks less crazy. Shares of Tesla have rallied over 50% since the company posted its second consecutive quarterly profit last Wednesday, which was viewed as a major accomplishment for a company competing against established automotive heavyweights including General Motors Co and BMW.  Tesla shares have climbed about 400% since early June, helped by the company\u2019s better-than-expected financial results and ramped-up production at its new car factory in Shanghai.  On Tuesday, Tesla surged as much as 24% before falling back in the final minutes of the trading session to end the day up 13.7%. That put its market capitalization at $160 billion, almost twice the combined value of Ford Motor and General Motors.  The shares had also rallied on Monday, partly fueled by Panasonic Corp\u2019s saying its automotive battery venture with Tesla was profitable for the first time.  The options Musk was awarded in 2018 vest incrementally based on targets for Tesla\u2019s stock market value and its financial performance. The market capitalization would have to sustainably rise by $50 billion increments over the agreement\u2019s 10-year period, with the full package payout reached if the market cap reaches $650 billion, as well as the company\u2019s meeting revenue and profit targets.  Musk is on his way to seeing his first two tranches of options vest. He achieved operational targets on revenue and adjusted earnings last year.  The rise in Tesla\u2019s market capitalization last month to a target of $100 billion opened the way for Musk\u2019s first tranche of options to vest. With Tuesday\u2019s surging share price, the market capitalization blew past the second target of $150 billion, opening the way for the second tranche to vest. Tesla\u2019s market capitalization must stay at or above each target level for one- and six-month averages for each set of options to vest.  Tesla was valued at about $52 billion when shareholders approved the pay package in March 2018, a time when the company faced a cash crunch, production delays and increasing competition from rivals.  A full payoff for Musk would surpass anything previously granted to U.S. executives, according to Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisor that recommended investors reject the pay package deal at the time.  Musk currently owns about 34 million Tesla shares, and his compensation package would let him buy another 20.3 million shares if all his options tranches vest.  When Tesla unveiled Musk\u2019s package, it said he could in theory reap as much as $55.8 billion if no new shares were issued. However, Tesla has since awarded stock to employees and last year sold $2.7 billion in shares and convertible bonds, diluting the value of the stock.  Musk has transformed Tesla from a niche car maker with production problems into the global leader in electric vehicles, with U.S. and Chinese factories. So far it has stayed ahead of more established rivals including BMW and Volkswagen .  Many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth. More Wall Street analysts rate Tesla \u201csell\u201d than \u201cbuy,\u201d and the company\u2019s stock is the most shorted on Wall Street.","321":"(Reuters) - Jim Keller, a prominent executive who helped design chips at Apple Inc and Tesla Inc before joining Intel Corp two years ago, left the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker effective June 11, Intel said in a news post.  Intel said Keller resigned for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d but has agreed to become a consultant to the company for six months.  Keller, who has also helped engineer chips for Advanced Micro Devices, was seen by analysts as a win for Intel when hired in 2018, when the company was several years behind on delivering more powerful chips manufactured using new processes.  In an internal memo seen by Reuters, Murthy Renduchintala, Intel\u2019s chief engineering officer, said the company was \u201csad to see him go.  \u201cMany of us have witnessed first-hand Jim\u2019s technical strength in CPU design and passion for silicon engineering,\u201d Renduchintala wrote. \u201cI personally very much appreciated his efforts to help us advance Intel\u2019s product leadership.\u201d  Intel plans to reorganize its chip engineering efforts, with four executives - Sundari Mitra, Gene Scuteri, Daaman Hejmadi and Navid Shahriari - taking on new leadership roles reporting to Renduchintala, the memo said.","322":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Friday named Oracle Corp co-founder Larry Ellison, a shareholder and self-described close friend of Chief Executive Elon Musk, to its board to provide the independent oversight demanded by U.S. regulators after Musk tweeted about taking the electric carmaker private.  The move is meant to usher Tesla past months of turbulence following Musk\u2019s Aug. 7 tweet that he was considering taking the company private and had secured funding.  The fallout, which included the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subsequently filing fraud charges against Musk for what it said were his \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d tweets, led some investors to call for stronger board oversight of Musk.  The inclusion of Ellison puts one of the world\u2019s richest people with experience building a startup into a successful company on Tesla\u2019s board. He served as a director at Apple at a critical time for that company \u2013 in the five years after Steve Jobs returned to the helm of the then struggling computer maker in 1997, helping oversee one the greatest turnarounds in corporate history.  Joining Ellison on the board, effective Dec. 27, was Walgreens Boots Alliance\u2019s global head of human resources, Kathleen Wilson-Thompson.  Charles Elson, director of the corporate governance center at the University of Delaware, questioned adding a friend of Musk\u2019s and another director with no experience at an industrial company like Tesla.  \u201cWhy would you put a friend (on the board) if the idea of the two independent directors were to be objective,\u201d Elson said. \u201cInvestors who were hoping for two newly objective directors who could stand up to Mr. Musk would be rather disappointed by the choice.\u201d  Under a court-approved agreement with the SEC, Musk agreed to pay a $20 million fine and step aside as Tesla\u2019s chairman for three years to settle charges that could have forced his exit. Tesla also agreed to name the independent directors and a board committee to control Musk\u2019s communications.  SEC officials could not be reached to comment on Friday, but Harvey Pitt, the agency\u2019s former chairman, called the addition of Ellison a positive step.

Ellison bought 3 million shares of Tesla earlier this year. Through a spokeswoman, he declined to comment.  Tesla\u2019s shares closed up 5.6 percent at $333.87 on Friday.  Musk on Friday afternoon tweeted his welcome: \u201cExcited to have Larry Ellison & Kathleen Wilson-Thompson join the Tesla board!\u201d  In November, Tesla named director Robyn Denholm as board chair, fulfilling one of the SEC\u2019s demands. Denholm, who joined Tesla as an independent director in 2014 and agreed to step down as finance chief of Australian telecoms firm Telstra Corp Ltd, spent 11 years as a senior vice president at Sun Microsystems, a unit of Oracle.  Tesla said it conducted a \u201cthorough, expansive\u201d search process for the directors, calling Ellison a \u201cpreeminent entrepreneur\u201d and Wilson-Thompson \u201ca human resources leader\u201d and said both had a passion for sustainable energy. They bring the Tesla board count to 11 people.  The larger-than-life Ellison, like Musk, is known for making bombastic, brash public comments. He went on a diatribe attacking cloud computing at a 2008 analyst conference, which only served to highlight Oracle\u2019s slow move into the space. He undermined Oracle\u2019s business relationship with Hewlett Packard in 2010 in an email to the New York Times that chastised the board for firing its CEO and his friend, Mark Hurd, after a sexual harassment inquiry.  He rarely interacts with journalists or blogs, and has only tweeted once - a 2012 message promoting Oracle\u2019s cloud products.  \u201cVERY CLOSE FRIENDS\u201d  Ellison, said by Forbes magazine to be worth $55 billion, has in the past defended Musk.  \u201cI\u2019m very close friends with Elon Musk, and I\u2019m a big investor in Tesla,\u201d Ellison, 74, said on a Oct. 26 conference call with analysts.  \u201cThis guy is landing rockets,\u201d Ellison added about Musk, referring to his leadership of SpaceX. \u201cHe\u2019s landing rockets on robot drone rafts in the ocean, and you\u2019re saying he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. Well, who else is landing a rocket?\u201d  Wilson-Thompson, who could not be immediately reached for comment, spent 17 years at Kellogg Co before joining Walgreens, and serves on the boards of two U.S.-based manufacturing companies.  Musk has gained fans for his bold approach to business and technology, using his almost 24 million Twitter followers to promote Tesla, SpaceX and tunnel venture Boring Co.  But the August claim that he had the funding to take Tesla private, and a subsequent U-turn, stunned Wall Street. It all came as Musk was filmed briefly smoking marijuana during a live Web show and as he called a British diver in the Thai cave rescue a \u201cpedo.\u201d  Tesla\u2019s market cap exceeds that of traditional, established U.S. automakers that make millions of vehicles and billions of dollars in profits annually, and the company has garnered legions of fans despite repeated production issues.","323":"BEIJING (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O has dropped the standard-range variants of its Model X and Model S from its product lineup and adjusted prices across its range, in a sales push that comes days after the U.S. electric vehicle maker reported record deliveries.  To simplify its offerings, the automaker on Tuesday limited variants of its Model X sport-utility vehicle and Model S sedan to \u201cLong Range\u201d and the more expensive \u201cPerformance\u201d. It also trimmed the price of its now entry-level Long Range variants.  The discontinuation of the standard-range variants, however, means a rise in starting prices - to $84,990 for the Model X and $79,990 for the Model S, excluding potential buying incentives.  Tesla also lowered the starting price of its mass-market Model 3 to $38,990.  \u201cTo make purchasing our vehicles even simpler, we are standardizing our global vehicle lineup and streamlining the number of trim packages offered for Model S, Model X and Model 3,\u201d Tesla said in a statement.  \u201cWe are also adjusting our pricing in order to continue to improve affordability for customers.\u201d  Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted on Tuesday that the price of Tesla's full self-driving option is \"increasing by ~$1000 on August 16\".

Earlier this month, Tesla said global deliveries of its three models in the second quarter of this year rose 51% from the previous quarter to a record 95,200 vehicles. The Model 3 accounted for about 80% of the total, underscoring the vehicle\u2019s role as the linchpin of Tesla\u2019s growth strategy.  The automaker said it expected production and deliveries to continue growing in the third quarter.  In China, the world\u2019s largest market for electric vehicles, Tesla\u2019s changes on Tuesday pushed up the starting price of its Model X to 790,900 yuan ($115,068) and Model S to 776,900 yuan.  Tesla is building a factory in Shanghai where it initially plans to build Model 3 cars. It is taking orders for those China-made versions, which have a starting price of 328,000 yuan.","324":"Dieter Zetsche, chairman of the board of management of Daimler AG, attends a press conference on the second press day of the Paris auto show, in Paris, France, October 3, 2018.

The announcement of Tesla\u2019s investment, buried in Tesla\u2019s 2020 annual report, follows months of tweets by Musk related to cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, sometimes helping fuel its rally.  The cryptocurrency jumped 10% on Monday following Tesla\u2019s disclosure.  In a December exchange on Twitter, Musk asked MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, who recommended Tesla buy Bitcoin, about the possibility of \u201clarge transactions\u201d to convert some of Tesla\u2019s balance sheet to the cryptocurrency.  Saylor is a Bitcoin bull and his software company has bought around 71,000 bitcoins, currently worth close to $3 billion. MicroStrategy\u2019s stock jumped 18% on Monday, bringing its gain in 2021 to 146% as traders view it as a play on Bitcoin.  Replying in May to a tweet by author J.K. Rowling about Bitcoin, Musk wrote that massive debt taken on by central banks made Bitcoin more attractive. He added that he owned only a quarter of a bitcoin, which was trading below $10,000 at the time.  Last month, Musk added \u201c#Bitcoin\u201d to his Twitter profile, sparking a 14% surge in the digital currency, and in December he tweeted, \u201cBitcoin is my safe word.\u201d  Driven in part by interest from institutional investors, the price of Bitcoin has quadrupled since in the past four months, surging far beyond record highs set in 2017.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The electric carmaker has stuck to its forecast of delivering half a million vehicles in 2020 despite a global pandemic and economic upheaval that has sunk most of its internal combustion rivals deep into the red.  That means Tesla must deliver more than 181,600 vehicles in the last three months of the year - a 30% increase from record third quarter deliveries of 139,300 vehicles.  While several analysts believe that goal is attainable, others see a worsening macroeconomic environment ahead.  \u201cI\u2019m ... cautious about demand given the recessionary environment and accelerating pace of coronavirus infections, making it tough for the company to hit its 500K car sales target for the year,\u201d said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at investing.com.  Analysts on average expect Tesla to report net income of $593 million in the third quarter on revenue of $8.4 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  Several analysts, including Frank Schwope at Nord\/LB, believe the positive numbers are due to regulatory credits - payments Tesla receives from other carmakers to offset their emissions.  Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn said in July the carmaker expected credit revenue in 2020 to double from 2019 levels, but said that cash flow will eventually decline.  With recovery in the United States sluggish and Europe struggling with a second bout of the virus outbreak, Tesla analysts had pinned their hopes for growth on China, which has begun to recover as consumers shake off the pandemic\u2019s effects.  While Tesla does not break out regional sales, data from China\u2019s auto industry association CPCA showed Tesla Model 3 sedan sales remained roughly flat from July to September. Overall, Tesla sold a total of around 34,100 Shanghai-made Model 3s in the third quarter.  Third-quarter registration data from California, Tesla\u2019s largest U.S. market, on Tuesday showed Tesla vehicle registrations dropped 13% compared with last year.  Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note they hoped Tesla would provide investors with more details on Wednesday about the Chinese market and which countries compensated for lackluster demand in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.  Tesla plans to ramp up production over the coming years by expanding output at its Shanghai plant to 250,000 vehicles a year, including its crossover Model Y.

The settlement requires him to be more restrained on Twitter, prompting speculation that the agency could review the agreement after Musk\u2019s Oct. 4 tweet which came hours after a federal judge ordered him and the SEC to justify their settlement. Shares of the electric carmaker fell as much as 4 percent after that tweet.  \u201cI think it was an appropriate settlement; one that sent a message to the marketplace, letting CEOs know that if they speak, they need to speak accurately,\u201d Clayton said.","330":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Tuesday he is considering taking Tesla Inc private in what would be the largest deal of its type, moving the electric car maker out of the glare of Wall Street as it goes through a period of rapid growth under tight financial constraints.  \u201cAm considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured,\u201d Musk said on Twitter. At $420 per share, a deal would be worth $72 billion overall.  In a letter to Tesla employees published more than an hour later on the company\u2019s blog, Musk explained that going private would be \u201cthe best path forward.\u201d Such a move - over which no final decision had been made - would let Tesla \u201coperate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible,\u201d he wrote.  Tesla shares closed up 11 percent at $379.57, slightly below their all-time high.  Asked on Twitter whether Musk would continue to be CEO under such a scenario, he replied there would be \u201cno change.\u201d  Musk has been under intense pressure this year to turn his money-losing, debt-laden company into a profitable higher-volume manufacturer, a prospect that has sent Tesla\u2019s valuation higher than that of General Motors Co.  The company is still working its way out of what Musk called \u201cproduction hell\u201d at its home factory in Fremont, California, where a series of manufacturing challenges delayed the ramp-up of production of its new Model 3 sedan, on which the company\u2019s profitability rests.  The Silicon Valley company faces a make-or-break moment in its eight-year history as a public company as competition from European automakers is poised to intensify with new electric vehicles from Audi and Jaguar, with more rivals to follow suit next year.  Meanwhile, Tesla has announced plans to build a factory in Shanghai, China, and another in Europe, but details are scarce and funding unknown.  Going private is one way to avoid close scrutiny by the public market as Musk and the company face those challenges. Musk has feuded publicly with regulators, critics, short sellers and reporters, and some analysts suggested that less transparency would be welcomed by Musk.  \u201cMusk does not want to run a public company,\u201d said Gene Munster of Loup Ventures, as Tesla\u2019s ambitious mission makes it \u201cdifficult to accommodate investors\u2019 quarterly expectations.\u201d  Musk owns nearly 20 percent of the company. He said in his letter to employees he did not seek to expand his ownership.  A price of $420 per share would represent a nearly 23 percent premium to Tesla\u2019s closing price on Monday, which gave the company a market value of about $58 billion.  In his letter, Musk suggested a choice for shareholders of selling their shares for $420 each or remaining investors in a private Tesla. He said he hoped all current investors would remain were the company to go private.  He made no mention in his tweets nor his letter where the funding for a deal would come from, and the letter did not discuss funding for the plan.  Like any other investor, Musk is beholden to securities laws and several securities attorneys told Reuters he potentially could face lawsuits if it was proven he did not have secure financing at the time of his tweet.  The stock move could give Tesla some debt relief. It drove $2.3 billion of convertible debt past the level at which investors can swap it for stock at a profit; if that happens Tesla will not have to pay back the debt with cash.

REUTERS\/Joe Skipper\/File Photo  (GRAPHIC-Market value of Tesla, Ford, GM: tmsnrt.rs\/2n4mFjh)  BIGGEST GO-PRIVATE DEAL  If Musk were to succeed in taking Tesla private, it would be the largest leveraged buyout of all time, beating the record set by the $45 billion deal for Texas power utility Energy Future Holdings, which ended in bankruptcy in 2014.  Raising both the debt and equity required for such a deal would be a challenge. Many major Wall Street bankers contacted by Reuters said on condition of anonymity they were not aware of Musk\u2019s plans ahead of his tweets, and several expressed skepticism that a leveraged buyout of Tesla could be financed given the company\u2019s negative cash flow.  \u201cIt\u2019s unfathomable to me that anyone would finance the acquisition of such a liability-laden company that is losing so much money and have massive capex requirements going forward,\u201d said Mark Spiegel, portfolio manager of hedge fund Stanphyl Capital Partners, who holds a short position in Tesla and has been a vocal critic of Musk on Twitter.  The most obvious equity partners for Musk would be a sovereign wealth fund such as Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF) or major technology investment funds such as SoftBank Group Corp\u2019s Vision Fund, bankers said.  China\u2019s Tencent Holdings, which took a 5 percent stake in Tesla last year, is another possible partner.  Such foreign sources of capital would be subject to scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which looks closely at deals for potential national security risks.  Earlier on Tuesday, a source familiar with the matter said Saudi Arabia\u2019s PIF had bought a minority stake of just below 5 percent in Tesla.  UNORTHODOX ANNOUNCEMENT  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment on Musk\u2019s tweet, but the agency allows companies to use social media outlets like Twitter to announce key information in compliance with its fair disclosure rules if investors are alerted about which social media outlets will be used.  Tesla alerted investors in a 2013 SEC filing that they should follow Musk\u2019s Twitter feed for \u201cadditional information\u201d about the company. There is no reference to Musk\u2019s Twitter account on the company\u2019s investor relations page under \u201cinvestor communication,\u201d although Tesla\u2019s Twitter feed is included.  In his letter to employees, Musk wrote that, \u201cas the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market, being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company.\u201d  A short squeeze is a trading scenario that occurs from time to time in heavily shorted stocks, when bearish traders are forced to buy shares to avoid big losses - something that ends up pushing the stock only higher.  Short interest in Tesla on Tuesday stood at nearly $13 billion, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.

Just three S&P 500 members announced splits in 2020, down from 12 in 2011, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.  The success of the splits for Apple and Tesla could lead CEOs of other companies with high-priced stocks to consider their own splits.  Stock splits an endangered species on Wall Street  Both Silicon Valley companies have massive followings among individual investors. In recent sessions, Apple and Tesla were the two most-traded stocks at Fidelity\u2019s brokerage, with customers overwhelmingly buying.  Tesla\u2019s stock has surged over 70% since its split was announced on Aug. 11. Apple has jumped over 30% since it announced its split on July 30, along with a blowout quarterly report.  Trading at over $2,000 on Friday on a split-adjusted basis, Tesla's stock had among the highest price tags on Wall Street. Other companies with quadruple-digit stock prices included Amazon AMZN.O, at over $3,400, Google-parent Alphabet GOOGL.O, at over $1,600, and Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG.N, trading at over $1,300.  Apple\u2019s previous stock split was 7-for-1 in 2014, and this month\u2019s split was its fifth since going public in 1980.  Apple and Tesla\u2019s share splits applied to shareholders of record on Aug. 24.  Apple's market capitalization has surged above $2 trillion, and it overtook Saudi Aramco 2222.SE as the world's most valuable publicly listed company.  Tesla's stock has jumped almost 500% this year, while shares of General Motors Co GM.N and Ford Motor Co F.N fell due to fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.","333":"Jan 20 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc has signed an agreement to allow extraction of lithium from its geothermal wells in California, a project that could offer U.S. carmakers and battery producers a secure supply of the metal, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.  The venture has been in talks to supply Tesla Inc with lithium, a component for batteries to power electric cars, the newspaper reported here, citing people familiar with the company.  Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s geothermal wells could produce up to 90,000 tonnes of lithium a year worth $1.5 billion at current prices, the report said, citing a fundraising document.  \u201cWe see a lot of interest in getting North American supply as automakers start to get further into electric vehicles,\u201d the FT quoted Eric Besseling, a vice president at BHE Renewables, as saying.

The California company\u2019s stock has jumped nearly 20% since S&P Dow Jones Indices announced late on Monday it would add Tesla to Wall Street\u2019s most watched benchmark as of Dec. 21, a change that will force index funds to buy around $50 billion of its stock.  A blockbuster quarterly report in July cleared a major hurdle for Tesla\u2019s potential inclusion in the S&P 500, leading to speculation that the company, now with a market capitalization over $450 billion, might be added to the index and spark a surge in demand for its shares.  Up about 500% in 2020, Tesla has become the most valuable auto company in the world, by far, despite production that is a fraction of rivals such as Toyota Motor 7203.T, Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE and General Motors GM.N.  Its stock tumbled 21% in one session on Sept. 8 after it was left out of a group companies being added to the S&P 500, underscoring how much many traders expected it to be added.","335":"Slideshow ( 4 images )  (Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Wednesday became the highest-valued automaker as its shares surged to record highs and the electric carmaker\u2019s market capitalization overtook that of former front runner Toyota Motors Corp.  Tesla shares gained 5% in early morning trade to a record of $1,133, boosting the company\u2019s market cap to $209.47 billion - roughly $6 billion more than Toyota is currently valued by investors.  Tesla is now worth more than triple the combined value of U.S. automakers General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co.  The shares\u2019 meteoric rise, up more than 163% since the start of 2020, highlight growing confidence among investors about the future of electric vehicles and Tesla\u2019s shift from a niche carmaker into a global leader in cleaner cars.  After several years of losses, Tesla has delivered three straight profitable quarters since the third quarter of 2019 and surprised investors with solid first-quarter deliveries despite the virus outbreak.  Toyota, one of the world\u2019s most profitable automakers, sold 10.46 million vehicles during its 2019 financial year, ending on March 31, 2020. It reported net revenues of 30,226 billion yen, or roughly $281.20 billion, during that time.  Tesla, in comparison, ended 2019 with $24.6 billion in revenues, having delivered 367,200 vehicles last year. Chief Executive Elon Musk in the past said Tesla would deliver at least 500,000 vehicles in 2020, a forecast the company has not changed despite the coronavirus pandemic.  Tesla is expected to report second-quarter delivery numbers this week.","336":"Dec 18 (Reuters) - Tesla\u2019s grand entrance into the S&P 500 is expected to be preceded by a huge trade, with an unprecedented $80 billion of the electric car maker\u2019s stock changing hands by the end of the session on Friday.  Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla on Monday will become the most valuable company ever admitted to Wall Street\u2019s main benchmark, accounting for over 1% of the index. The electric car maker\u2019s shares have surged about 60% since mid-November, when its debut in the S&P 500 was announced.  Its addition to the S&P 500 will force index-tracking funds to buy over $80 billion worth of Tesla shares by the end of Friday\u2019s session so their portfolios correctly reflect the index, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Those funds will simultaneously have to sell other S&P 500 constituents\u2019 shares worth the same amount.  \u201cIndex managers will need to sell a large position across the other S&P 500 constituents in order to fund the addition of TSLA, which could lead to substantial impact across the entire index,\u201d Virtu ITG Canada\u2019s head of index research, Ivan Cajic, wrote in a report this week.  Actively managed funds that benchmark their performance against the S&P 500, many of which until now have avoided investing in one of Wall Street\u2019s most controversial stocks, will also be forced to decide whether to own Tesla.  While some investors view Musk as a visionary entrepreneur, others worry about missed production targets and corporate governance risk after Musk was forced to step down as chairman to settle fraud charges in 2018.  California-based Tesla\u2019s stock has surged almost 700% year-to-date, putting its stock market value at over $600 billion and making it the sixth most valuable publicly listed U.S. company, with many investors viewing it as wildly overvalued.  Tesla\u2019s meteoric rise has made it the most valuable auto company in the world despite production that is a fraction of rivals such as Toyota Motor, Volkswagen and General Motors.  Tesla is by far the most traded stock by value on Wall Street, with $18 billion worth of its shares exchanged on average in each session over the past 12 months, easily beating Apple, in second place with average daily trades of $14 billion, according to Refinitiv.  A blockbuster quarterly report in July cleared a major hurdle related to profitability that had prevented Tesla\u2019s inclusion in the S&P 500.  About a fifth of Tesla\u2019s shares are closely held by Musk, the chief executive, and other insiders. Since the S&P 500 is weighted by the amount of companies\u2019 shares actually available on the stock market, Tesla\u2019s influence within the benchmark will be slightly diminished compared to its overall value.","337":"LONDON, March 2 (Reuters) - British firefighters said they had brought a serious fire at a Tesla showroom in southern England under control hours after it broke out on Saturday morning.

It later said that Chief People Officer Gaby Toledano would not return from a leave of absence, just over a year after joining.  Later on Friday, Tesla named a new president of automotive operations, promoting eight-year Tesla employee and former Daimler truck exec Jerome Guillen into the role overseeing all automotive operations and reporting to Musk.

Viecha also restated Tesla\u2019s forecast that it will build 50,000 to 55,000 of its Model 3 sedans in the current quarter, and indicated the company\u2019s working capital will improve as production increases, Spak wrote.

The second price cut to the Model 3 this year now brings the cost of its least expensive variant to $42,900, according to the company's website here.  Tesla\u2019s customer referral incentive plan ended on Feb. 1 after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk had tweeted that the referral program was \u201cadding too much cost to the cars, especially Model 3\u201d.  Tesla delivered fewer-than-expected Model 3 sedans in the fourth quarter and cut prices for all its vehicles in the United States to offset a reduction in a green tax credit.  The company is rapidly increasing production of its Model 3 sedan and lower prices could help it reach a broader customer base than its pure luxury vehicles.

The link to the full blog is: here  FILE PHOTO: Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveils the Roadster 2 during a presentation in Hawthorne, California, U.S., November 16, 2017. Tesla\/Handout via REUTERS\/File Photo  Taking Tesla Private  The following email was sent to Tesla employees today:  Earlier today, I announced that I\u2019m considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420\/share. I wanted to let you know my rationale for this, and why I think this is the best path forward.  First, a final decision has not yet been made, but the reason for doing this is all about creating the environment for Tesla to operate best. As a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders. Being public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long-term. Finally, as the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market, being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company.  I fundamentally believe that we are at our best when everyone is focused on executing, when we can remain focused on our long-term mission, and when there are not perverse incentives for people to try to harm what we\u2019re all trying to achieve.  This is especially true for a company like Tesla that has a long-term, forward-looking mission. SpaceX is a perfect example: it is far more operationally efficient, and that is largely due to the fact that it is privately held. This is not to say that it will make sense for Tesla to be private over the long-term. In the future, once Tesla enters a phase of slower, more predictable growth, it will likely make sense to return to the public markets.  Here\u2019s what I envision being private would mean for all shareholders, including all of our employees.  First, I would like to structure this so that all shareholders have a choice. Either they can stay investors in a private Tesla or they can be bought out at $420 per share, which is a 20% premium over the stock price following our Q2 earnings call (which had already increased by 16%). My hope is for all shareholders to remain, but if they prefer to be bought out, then this would enable that to happen at a nice premium.  Second, my intention is for all Tesla employees to remain shareholders of the company, just as is the case at SpaceX. If we were to go private, employees would still be able to periodically sell their shares and exercise their options. This would enable you to still share in the growing value of the company that you have all worked so hard to build over time.  Third, the intention is not to merge SpaceX and Tesla. They would continue to have separate ownership and governance structures. However, the structure envisioned for Tesla is similar in many ways to the SpaceX structure: external shareholders and employee shareholders have an opportunity to sell or buy approximately every six months.  Finally, this has nothing to do with accumulating control for myself. I own about 20% of the company now, and I don\u2019t envision that being substantially different after any deal is completed.  Basically, I\u2019m trying to accomplish an outcome where Tesla can operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible, and where there is as little change for all of our investors, including all of our employees, as possible.  This proposal to go private would ultimately be finalized through a vote of our shareholders. If the process ends the way I expect it will, a private Tesla would ultimately be an enormous opportunity for all of us. Either way, the future is very bright and we\u2019ll keep fighting to achieve our mission.  Thanks,  Elon","351":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc has named director Robyn Denholm as board chair, fulfilling a demand by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to strip the job from Elon Musk, the electric car maker\u2019s wayward chief executive who has dragged the company through months of turbulence.  The appointment was required as part of a September deal Tesla struck with the securities regulator to settle fraud charges against Musk and Tesla. Legal experts said it was unclear if Denholm, who has been on Tesla\u2019s board for four years, was independent enough for Tesla to comply with the court-approved settlement.  Denholm, 55, joined Tesla as an independent director in 2014 and is the head of its audit committee. She was paid almost $5 million, mainly in stock options, by the company last year, making her the highest remunerated of its board members.  She is finance chief at Australian telecoms firm Telstra Corp Ltd and previously worked for Toyota in Australia, according to her LinkedIn profile. She will resign from Telstra to take the Tesla role full-time.  Whether she is independent enough to rein in public outbursts by Musk - who mocked the SEC as the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission\u201d on Twitter after the fraud charge settlement - is an open question.  Denholm sat on the board when Musk set production targets for the Model 3 car that were not met, and also when the chief executive tweeted that he had secured funding to take Tesla private, which prompted the SEC to file fraud charges against him.  The court-approved settlement of those charges requires Tesla to certify in writing that it has appointed an \u201cindependent\u201d chairman and to provide evidence and exhibits to make its case.  While the definition of \u201cindependent\u201d is typically broad, legal experts suggested the court could ultimately conclude Tesla was not in compliance with the letter of the settlement.  \u201cIt does violate the spirit of the settlement, which was to change the culture of the board so there was a check on Musk\u2019s worst instincts,\u201d said Stephen Diamond, a professor of corporate governance at Santa Clara University.  The SEC declined to comment beyond the court judgment.  Musk, who remains Tesla's biggest shareholder and the driving force behind its ambitious plans to reshape electric battery technology and car transport, tweeted here his approval of the appointment.  Robyn Denholm and Elon Musk. REUTERS\/Files  \u201cMusk, I believe, has a ton to do with the selection and he wants to be sure that they can see eye-to-eye,\u201d said Elazar Capital analyst Chaim Siegel.  Top proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass, Lewis & Co had each classified Denholm as an \u201cindependent\u201d director of Tesla in reports to the carmaker\u2019s investors earlier this year.  HUMBLE BEGINNINGS  Denholm pumped petrol at her parents\u2019 filling station before going on to study at Sydney University and joining accounting firm Arthur Andersen.  Since then, she has worked at Swiss power grid maker ABB Ltd, network gear firm Juniper Networks and computing firm Sun Microsystems. She has also been national manager of finance for Toyota Australia.  Telstra CEO Andy Penn said when he appointed her: \u201cRobyn has a proven track record as a global COO in a business focused on telecommunications networks.\u201d  Executive recruiter Patricia Lenkov, however, said that Denholm likely was not the right pick for the job, arguing Tesla needed a figure with more experience dealing with strong founders.  \u201cThere might be an element of risk here. She\u2019s not a proven entity in this kind of work,\u201d she said.  While Tesla is finally starting to make good on Musk\u2019s promises on production of the Model 3 sedan, seen as crucial to the company\u2019s future, it has lost senior executives for sales, human resources, manufacturing and finance in recent months.  Its vice president for manufacturing Gilbert Passin was reported last month to have left.  \u201cWe view the fact that Denholm has prior industry experience with Toyota positively,\u201d said CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson, adding it made sense that Tesla should seek to avoid the risk of a genuine outsider clashing with Musk.  The Silicon Valley billionaire\u2019s gift for self-promotion has made Tesla one of the world\u2019s most talked-about businesses but also caused public spats with journalists, analysts, Wall Street investors and even rapper Azealia Banks.  He is being sued for calling one of the divers behind this year\u2019s Thai cave rescue a \u201cpedo\u201d.  According to The Australian newspaper, Denholm said the only things that really disappoint her are rudeness and waste.  \u201cPoliteness costs you absolutely nothing. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you are the most senior person in the room, or the most junior,\u201d she told the paper in an interview a few years ago.

Rowe Price Inc funds who came to opposite conclusions about the carmaker during the second quarter, recent commentaries show, even before Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk started tweeting about taking the carmaker private.  The split opinion matters because the enthusiasm of top investors will determine how much money Musk would need to raise.  T. Rowe Price of Baltimore remained Tesla\u2019s third-largest investor with about 12 million shares at June 30, down 24 percent from the prior quarter.  A spokesman for the firm declined to comment.  Among other top holders, Baillie Gifford & Co and BlackRock Inc raised their stakes during the quarter by 3 and 7 percent respectively, filings show, while Fidelity funds as a group cut Tesla by 21 percent to 11.2 million shares.  Fidelity and BlackRock spokespeople declined to comment. A Baillie Gifford representative did not immediately comment.  Managers of the T. Rowe Price Global Technology Fund wrote in a June 30 semiannual report that in regards to Tesla, \u201cWe trimmed our position significantly as the stock rose, feeling that the risk\/return trade-off had grown less attractive at higher valuation levels.\u201d  The fund, led by Joshua Spencer, held 505,283 Tesla shares at the end of June, disclosures show, less than a sixth of the 3,192,850 shares held at the end of March, the biggest recent sale among funds tracked by Thomson Reuters Eikon. At Dec. 31 it had 2,250,300 Tesla shares.  Tesla has risen and fallen in Spencer\u2019s holdings before, which he has termed an \u201con-again, off-again relationship.\u201d  Tesla shares finished June at $342.95, up 29 percent from the end of the March. They closed Tuesday at $321.90, up 4 percent.  While Spencer\u2019s fund was selling Tesla, its second-largest buyer in the second quarter was T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund. It had 1,298,653 Tesla shares at June 30, up from 821,953 at March 31, disclosures show.  In a quarterly review as of June 30, managers led by Larry Puglia wrote they added shares \u201cas we were encouraged by the company\u2019s announcement of incremental progress toward its Model 3 production target.\u201d  \u201cThe company also reaffirmed its guidance of achieving positive earnings and cash flow in the second half of 2018 and reiterated that an additional capital raise would not be necessary to fuel operations through the end of the year,\u201d they wrote. (Reporting by Ross Kerber Editing by Chris Reese)","369":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O chief Elon Musk's refusal to answer \"boring\" Wall Street questions about finances sent the electric vehicle maker's shares down as much as 7 percent on Thursday, jarring investors and raising concerns about its ability to raise money in the future.  Tesla\u2019s bonds followed the shares lower and, with at least three brokerages cutting price targets for the stock, several wondered what it would now cost the company to raise more funds this year if need be.  In a conference call on Wednesday, Musk refused to answer questions from analysts on Tesla\u2019s capital requirements, saying \u201cboring questions are not cool.\u201d  Instead, he took over a dozen consecutive questions from YouTube investment channel HyperChange TV, which had previously recommended buying Tesla shares.  Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne dubbed the call, in which Musk talked of \u201cbarnacles, flufferbots, and bonehead bears\u201d, surreal.  Morgan Stanley\u2019s Adam Jonas said it was the most unusual he had heard in 20 years in the business, noting that \u201cthe analysts on the call represent the providers of capital that Tesla has throughout its history depended upon.\u201d  Some saw the call in even more stark terms.  Eric Schiffer, head of the Patriarch Organization, a Los Angeles-based private equity firm, called it \u201cthe single greatest CEO meltdown in American car history.\u201d  \u201cElon Musk\u2019s war on day traders and analysts from big banks is like him being on the earnings call with a suicide vest on and pulling the cord. It\u2019s horribly incompetent with investors and results in the stock getting hit by roaring missiles,\u201d Schiffer said, adding that he did not own Tesla shares \u201cfor reasons like this.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: SpaceX founder Elon Musk pauses at a press conference following the first launch of a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S., February 6, 2018.

The company\u2019s shares closed down 5.5 percent at $284.45 in New York. They have lost more than a quarter of their value since touching a high of $389.61 in September, hurt by reports of bottlenecks around production of the Model 3 sedan, seen as crucial to Tesla\u2019s profitability.  Musk has won legions of vocal fans for his soaring vision and bold promises, from making electric vehicles mainstream to sending rockets into space as the CEO of SpaceX.  But the entrepreneur has also exhibited erratic behavior in recent months, from late-night tweets and jokes about bankruptcy to a public spat with regulators investigating a fatality involving a Tesla.  Some investors said Musk\u2019s behavior was part of his appeal.  \u201cWe like Elon Musk and because he gets frustrated it only makes him human,\u201d said Gerald Sparrow of Sparrow Capital. \u201cWe focus on the numbers they produce, not the emotions.\u201d  On Wednesday, Tesla forecast lower capital spending for the year and a profit in the second half.  Musk as also bullish on upcoming projects, promising decisions soon on the construction of a new Model Y factory, and the location of a Chinese Gigafactory. He also pledged to reduce third-party contractors, saying their use had \u201creally gotten out of control.\u201d  \u201cSo we\u2019re going to scrub the barnacles on that front. You\u2019ve got barnacles on barnacles. So there\u2019s going to be a lot of barnacle removal.\u201d  Tesla is closely held, with co-founder Musk owning 22 percent and its top four investors, including him, over 40 percent - giving Musk a certain freedom to brush off analyst concerns.  Tesla's market capitalization of $51 billion exceeds that of Ford Motor Co F.N, which posted revenues of $156.7 billion last year versus Tesla's $11.8 billion.  MANUFACTURING ON THE FLY  Tesla has consistently fallen short of its promises on car production and has promised in the past it would not need to raise funds, before doing just that.  The company has raised capital each year since its initial public offering in 2010 and issued debt twice in 2017.  Tesla\u2019s free cash flow widened to negative $1 billion in the first quarter from negative $277 million in the fourth quarter, excluding costs of systems for its solar business.  The company plans to reach its weekly goal of producing 5,000 Model 3 cars in two months, after revising the target several times.  \u201cWe believe that Tesla is essentially learning how to become a manufacturing company on the fly,\u201d said RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak.  \u201cInvestor feedback to the call was shock that a CEO would be dismissive and the general sentiment was that the defensiveness spoke volumes.\u201d","370":"(Updates to close)  Dec 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended lower on Friday, pulled down by uncertainty around a coronavirus stimulus deal, while Tesla shares hit a lifetime high in anticipation of their addition to the S&P 500 next week.  All three major indexes hit record highs at the opening before retreating. The S&P 500 technology index, which has led gains this week, was the biggest drag on the overall benchmark index.  Electric-car maker Tesla Inc, which will become on Monday the most valuable company to be ever added to Wall Street\u2019s main benchmark index, traded in heavy volume.  \u201cYou\u2019re already seeing significant levels of volume in Tesla stock today, moving a lot higher as a lot of these different ETFs and mutual funds position ahead of the change to get us close to the price as possible for tracking error purposes,\u201d said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest, in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Investors are seeing increased trading volumes also due to the expiration of stock index futures, stock index options, stock options and single stock futures at the end of trade, also known as \u201cquadruple witching.\u201d The U.S. Congress looked increasingly unlikely on Friday to meet a deadline to agree on $900 billion in fresh COVID-19 aid and instead may pass a third stopgap spending bill to keep the government from shutting down at midnight.  Recent weak economic data has increased pressure on lawmakers to reach a deal.  \u201cInvestors definitely want to see something come through or like to see something come through on the stimulus front sooner rather than later as COVID cases continue to rise and economic data has shown that it is beginning to deteriorate,\u201d Bell said.  Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 115.51 points, or 0.38%, to 30,187.86, the S&P 500 lost 12.78 points, or 0.34%, to 3,709.7 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 9.11 points, or 0.07%, to 12,755.64.  The prospect of continued monetary and fiscal stimulus has helped stocks look past the economic impact of the pandemic, and set them up for strong annual gains, despite a rocky start to the year.

Many factories across China shut in late January for the Lunar New Year holiday that was originally due to end on Jan. 30 but which was extended in a bid to contain the spread of the new flu-like virus that has killed more than 700 people.  Tesla warned on Jan. 30 that it would see a 1-1.5 week delay in the ramp-up of Shanghai-built Model 3 cars as a result of the epidemic, which has severely disrupted communications and supply chains across China.  Tesla Vice President Tao Lin said this week that production would restart on Feb. 10 and that car deliveries from the plant would be temporarily delayed.  \u201cIn view of the practical difficulties key manufacturing firms including Tesla have faced in resuming production, we will coordinate to make all efforts to help companies resume production as soon as possible,\u201d Shanghai municipal government spokesman Xu Wei said.  The $2 billion Shanghai factory is Tesla\u2019s first outside the United States and was built with support from local authorities. It started production in October and began deliveries last month.  The Shanghai government also said on Saturday it would ask banks to extend loans with preferential rates to small companies and exempt firms in hard-hit sectors like hospitality from value-added tax, among other measures to prop up businesses during the epidemic.  Such assistance would also apply to foreign companies.","372":"FILE PHOTO: Tesla CEO Elon Musk leaves Manhattan federal court after a hearing on his fraud settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in New York City, U.S., April 4, 2019.

The SEC in February sought to have Musk found in contempt of a fraud settlement last year after the CEO tweeted details about Tesla production numbers that were not vetted by the electric vehicle company\u2019s attorneys.  Instead, U.S. District Court Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan ordered Musk and the SEC to try to resolve the dispute on their own. The parties have already requested one extension.  The SEC sued Musk last year for making fraudulent statements after he tweeted on Aug. 7 that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The parties later settled and Musk agreed to step down as chairman and have the company\u2019s lawyers pre-approve written communications, including tweets with material information about the company. Musk\u2019s lawyers have argued that the February tweet did not contain new information that was material to investors.","373":"WASHINGTON\/BENGALURU (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are looking into parking lot crashes involving Tesla Inc TSLA.O cars driving themselves to their owners using the company's Smart Summon feature, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Wednesday.  Several users have posted videos on social media of Tesla vehicles that appear to have been in near accidents. One posted a video of a Tesla striking a garage wall and another of a Tesla being struck by a vehicle backing up.  A Tesla software update last week added its Smart Summon feature for some customers. When the car is within 200 feet and in their line of sight, they use a phone app to summon the vehicle in a parking lot.(bit.ly\/2lxm0qN)  On its website, Tesla\u2019s description of Summon reads: \u201cYour parked car will come find you anywhere in a parking lot. Really.\u201d  Asked about reports of crashes, NHTSA said it \u201cis aware of reports related to Tesla\u2019s Summon feature. We are in ongoing contact with the company and we continue to gather information. Safety is NHTSA\u2019s top priority and the agency will not hesitate to act if it finds evidence of a safety-related defect.\u201d  Tesla did not respond to a request for comment, but Chief Executive Elon Musk on Wednesday tweeted that there were more than 550,000 Smart Summon uses in the first few days.  Tesla says users of Smart Summon should have a clear line of sight and check the surroundings. It said the vehicle \u201cwill maneuver around or stop for objects and notify you when detected.\u201d  Users can stop the car from driving by releasing the app\u2019s button, it says, adding, \u201cYou are still responsible for your car and must monitor it and its surroundings at all times and be within your line of sight because it may not detect all obstacles. Be especially careful around quick moving people, bicycles and cars.\u201d  While Tesla said Summon is to be used only in private parking lots and driveways, the feature breaks new ground by allowing operation of a vehicle without a driver behind the wheel. Federal vehicle safety regulations were written decades ago, before such technology existed.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Tesla reported Wednesday that it delivered 97,000 vehicles in the third quarter, fewer than some analysts had expected.  In addition to the crashes depicted on social media, there are also videos of several near misses.  In one Twitter video, a Tesla exits a parking space and starts to cross a driveway when an SUV nearly collides with the driverless car. A voice is heard gasping and exclaiming, \u201cOh my God!\u201d  The poster, Dallas-based solutions architect Roddie Hasan, commented that his \"first test of Smart Summon didn't go so well.\" (bit.ly\/2nEXk0O)  \u201c..A car pulled in from the road and around the corner into the lot, and I expected the Tesla to \u2018see\u2019 it and stop, however I had to take my finger off the (app) button when I saw that my Tesla wasn\u2019t slowing down,\u201d Hasan told Reuters.  Another Twitter user, Mark Solomon, also posted a video that showed his car was not able to park itself properly using the feature.  \u201cNot sure what the problem was but I think an older map of the parking lot was being used,\u201d he said.  \u2018PROFOUND MOMENT\u2019  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Tesla\u2019s website warns that drivers \u201care still responsible for your car and must monitor it and its surroundings at all times and be within your line of sight because it may not detect all obstacles. Be especially careful around quick moving people, bicycles and cars.\u201d  Other users had positive reviews. One posted a video of a white Tesla that slowly maneuvered around a parking lot for over a minute, ultimately arriving safely next to where the operator was standing.  \u201cIt was a very profound moment to see this technology live! People don\u2019t understand the depths and multitude of challenges to make this happen,\u201d the Twitter user, @problematique79, told Reuters.  The summon feature is one of a suite of automated driving features that Musk has promised customers who have paid $6,000 for optional \u201cFull Self Driving\u201d packages of hardware and software.  Automated driving features are one way Tesla hopes to stay ahead of traditional automakers, which have been more conservative about enabling vehicles to operate without drivers.","374":"SAN FRANCISCO - Tesla Inc TSLA.O Chief Executive Elon Musk shot back against U.S. securities regulators on Monday, arguing in a filing that his recent tweet about the electric vehicle maker's production volume did not violate his fraud settlement and he cannot be held in contempt.  Musk\u2019s \u201csingle, immaterial\u201d tweet to his more than 24 million Twitter followers claiming the electric vehicle-maker would produce around 500,000 cars in 2019 also complied with company\u2019s communication policy for senior executives, a condition of the settlement, lawyers for the Tesla chief wrote in a filing in federal court in Manhattan.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had asked the court to hold Musk in contempt, saying his Feb. 19 tweet violated a September fraud settlement barring him from sharing material information about Tesla on social media without the company\u2019s pre-approval.  \u201cThis contempt action, following Musk\u2019s sincerely-held criticism of the SEC on 60 Minutes, also reflects concerning and unprecedented overreach on the part of the SEC,\u201d the filing said.  In December, Musk said in a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview that: \u201cI do not have respect for the SEC.\u201d  The settlement between Musk, Tesla and the SEC resolved an SEC lawsuit over claims Musk made on Twitter in August that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The SEC called those tweets \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d and a go-private deal never materialized.  As part of that settlement, Musk stepped down as the company\u2019s chairman and he and Tesla agreed to pay $20 million each in fines.  FILE PHOTO: Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory groundbreaking ceremony in Shanghai, China January 7, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  The renewed public battle between Tesla\u2019s chief executive and the top U.S. securities regulator adds pressure on Musk, the public face of Tesla, who is struggling to make the company profitable after cutting the price of its Model 3 sedan to $35,000.  Tesla has backed off a plan to close all its U.S. stores and said it will instead raise prices of its higher-end vehicles by about 3 percent on average.  In the filing, Musk\u2019s lawyers said his tweet was a \u201cproud and optimistic restatement of publicly disclosed information.\u201d  Musk corrected his tweet four hours later to say that the \u201cannualized production rate\u201d at year-end 2019 would probably be about 500,000, with deliveries expected to be about 400,000.  Moreover, Musk has exhibited self-censorship in dramatically reducing the volume of tweets since the settlement, they wrote, adding that the SEC\u2019s request, if granted, would raise free speech issues.  \u201cThis self-censorship is reflective of his commitment to adhering to the Order and avoiding unnecessary disputes with the SEC,\u201d they wrote in the filing.  Musk called the regulator the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission\u201d on Twitter after the settlement, and tweeted that \u201csomething is broken with SEC oversight\u201d just one day after the agency started pursuing the contempt order.  Legal experts have said the SEC could now pursue multiple avenues, including a higher fine, imposing further restrictions on Musk\u2019s activities or removing him from Tesla\u2019s board or helm.  Tesla published a new communications policy in December for senior executives as part of the settlement. It called for Tesla\u2019s general counsel and a newly designated in-house securities law attorney to pre-approve any written statements about Tesla that could be material.  A disclosure controls committee, made up of board members Brad Buss, Antonio Gracias and James Murdoch, was tasked with overseeing compliance with the new policy.","375":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O and General Motors Co GM.N, which have lobbied Congress to lift a cap on electric vehicles eligible for a $7,500 tax credit, could get their way for up to four years under a new proposal from a Republican senator.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  On Thursday, Senator Dean Heller proposed legislation that would lift the current cap on electric vehicles eligible for tax credits. Reuters obtained a copy of the text of the previously unreported bill, which has not been posted on the Senate website.  Under current law, once a manufacturer hits 200,000 EVs sold, the tax credit phases out starting in the following quarter. Heller\u2019s bill lifts the individual manufacturer cap but would phase out the credit for the entire industry in 2022.  Last week, Tesla said orders for cars placed by Monday would be eligible for a full federal tax credit of $7,500 and these customers will get their cars delivered by the end of the year. Tesla said in July it had hit the 200,000 vehicle threshold, which under law will result in the tax credit being reduced by 50 percent for six months and then cut to $1,875 for another six months until it ends.  GM has said it expects to hit the 200,000 threshold by the end of the year.  Both GM and Tesla have lobbied Congress on the issue, according to federal disclosure reports and interviews with lawmakers. Tesla declined to comment.  GM declined to comment on the Heller bill but said it is important \u201cto provide a federal tax credit for consumers to help make electric vehicles more affordable for all customers.\u201d GM Chief Executive Mary Barra has called for lifting the cap.  Other automakers are split over whether to back the effort. Some automakers think the credit should be limited to vehicles below a certain price, while others argue Heller\u2019s bill would penalize automakers that have not started selling EVs in big numbers.  Last week, Senator John Barrasso a Republican who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, proposed legislation to end the EV tax credit entirely and impose a new tax on EVs to fund highway repairs.  Senate Democrats are opposed to Barasso\u2019s measure. \u201cRepealing a policy that helps combat climate change is the absolute wrong decision,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the tax-writing Finance Committee.  Last month, seven Democratic senators introduced legislation to lift the EV cap and extend it for 10 years. It would also allow buyers to use the tax credit as a \u201cpoint of sale rebate.\u201d","376":"(Reuters) - Elon Musk, the billionaire chief executive officer of Tesla Inc TSLA.O, went on Twitter to ask users if the electric carmaker should build a new gigafactory in Texas.  \"Giga Texas?\" Musk tweeted here, giving two options - \"hell yeah\" and \"nope.\" The poll garnered over 102,000 responses as of 11:15 p.m. PT Tuesday, with about 80% voting in favor of the new gigafactory.  Tesla currently has two gigafactories in the U.S. and one in Shanghai, China. The carmaker in November announced plans to build its first European factory and design center near Berlin.  During an earnings conference call last week, Musk said that Tesla needs to increase its battery capacity to produce high-capacity models like Cybertruck.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got to scale battery production to crazy levels that people cannot even fathom today. That\u2019s the real problem,\u201d he said.  Tesla shares have been on a tear recently, more than doubling the company\u2019s market value since the start of the year as more investors bet on Musk\u2019s vision. The stock, which closed up 14% on Tuesday at $887.06, has surged nearly 400% since early June.  The latest bump was partly fueled by a quarterly profit at Japanese battery maker Panasonic Corp's 6752.T battery business with the U.S. car maker.  Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Musk\u2019s Texas gigafactory tweet.","377":"NEW YORK, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Pretty much everyone on Wall Street has an opinion about Tesla.  The electric vehicle maker\u2019s stupendous rally in recent months has given shareholders something to cheer about, cost short sellers billions of dollars and vindicated legions of retail investors who have long adored Elon Musk\u2019s company.  Tesla shares have climbed nearly 320% since early June, helped by the company\u2019s better-than-expected financial results and ramped-up production at its new car factory in Shanghai.  Another factor driving this week\u2019s rally may be fund managers hurrying to raise their allocation of the stock, analysts said.  \u201cA lot of advisors and institutions, they jump in the bandwagon because they don\u2019t want to trail,\u201d said vocal Tesla bull Ross Gerber, president and chief executive of Gerber Kawasaki in Santa Monica, California. \u201cIf Tesla goes to $1,000 and they don\u2019t own it, what are they going to tell their clients?\u201d  Gerber trimmed his fund\u2019s position in the stock as the company\u2019s valuation soared. He hopes to buy more if the stock falls and said a fair valuation would be around $550.  THE BULLS  Retail investors have driven part of the surge, as staunch defenders of Tesla crowd Twitter, Reddit and other web sites.  Among Fidelity Investments customers, Tesla has been by far the most actively traded stock in recent sessions, with nearly 16,000 buy orders for the electric carmaker\u2019s shares. Twitter, ranked second overall in trading activity on Fidelity, had just over 2,000 buy orders.  The stock is held widely by institutional shareholders. Tesla\u2019s biggest institutional shareholders are Baillie Gifford, Capital World and Vanguard, according to Refinitiv data.  It also has an international following. Retail investors in South Korea have been trading Tesla shares at a furious pace in recent weeks, buying and selling $200 million worth of stock in January, according to the Korea Securities Depository. Volume in November stood at $43 million.  Tesla options positioning is also bullish. According to data from options analytics provider Trade Alert, skew turned deeply negative this week, meaning that demand for calls, used to position for further share gains, has surpassed demand for puts, used to guard against a fall in shares.  That\u2019s a departure from the usual dynamic in most stocks, in which options used for downside protection generally command prices higher than those for upside participation.  Tesla\u2019s biggest winner is Musk, who stands to earn more than $1 billion thanks to Tesla\u2019s recent rally. The company\u2019s market capitalization briefly exceeded $150 billion this week, the second target in his record-breaking compensation package that opens the way to options awarded to him vesting.  THE BEARS  Many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth. More Wall Street analysts rate Tesla \u201csell\u201d than \u201cbuy,\u201d and the company\u2019s stock is the most shorted on Wall Street, with nearly $18 billion sold short.  Those bearish investors plan to profit by selling borrowed shares and buying them back later at a lower price. Yet while short investors in Tesla have suffered paper losses of over $11 billion so far in 2020, they have mostly held their ground, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.  One seller in the December quarter was Saudi Arabia\u2019s public investment fund, according to a filing on Tuesday.  Some funds that reportedly hold short positions are London-based Crispin Odey, according to the Financial Times. Odey was not immediately available for comment.  The Financial Times also reported that Greenlight Capital, run by David Einhorn, had told investors last month it held a put option against Tesla, which would be a bet against the stock.

Currently the Model 3 electric sedans made at the carmaker\u2019s Chinese plant use nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries. The starting price for the vehicles is currently 271,550 yuan ($39,900) after factoring in government subsidies.  Tesla will announce the product change as early as Thursday, the two sources said.

REUTERS\/Kim Kyung-Hoon  TOKYO (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp may upgrade one of its battery plants in Japan to produce advanced-format battery cells for Tesla Inc if needed by the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) maker, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.  Panasonic, currently the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla, produces cells for the EV maker at their joint plant in the U.S. state of Nevada - the so-called Gigafactory - as well as at two plants in Japan.  The Japanese plants handle cylindrical lithium-ion \u201c18650\u201d cells, used to power Tesla\u2019s Model S and Model X vehicles, whereas the Nevada plant produces the newer, higher-energy density \u201c2170\u201d cells for the mass-market Model 3 sedan.  The Japanese production lines would only need minor changes to switch to 2170 cells from the 18650, said the person, who declined to be identified as the matter was private.  Japan\u2019s Nikkan Kogyo newspaper reported on Wednesday that the upgrade could take place in this financial year ending March 2020.  Panasonic in a statement said nothing has been decided.  The development comes after Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said Panasonic had been \u201ca constraint on Model 3 output since July\u201d.

No change to headline or text)  BOSTON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Elon Musk wants to take Tesla Inc private, but some of his big investors may not be able to follow.  Most passive funds would have to drop Tesla if it were removed from stock indexes, experts said on Monday.  Actively-managed funds might need complicated approvals to hold a stake in the company, no matter how much of a mark Musk has made to date as founder and chief executive of the electric carmaker.  \u201cOur inclination is that if we could go private with him, we would, but it\u2019s complicated,\u201d said one large Tesla investor, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  \u201cWe would have to call clients and ask for approval, but it\u2019s complicated. And I think it\u2019s complicated for many funds,\u201d the person said.  The uncertainty over how many investors could hold private shares, and would want to, would be a challenge for Musk because the final tally would dictate how much capital he would need to raise to buy out those who would sell the stock.  Musk blogged on Monday he was reaching out to top investors to see \u201cwhether they had the ability and desire to remain shareholders in a private Tesla.\u201d  One pool that would likely not be Musk\u2019s allies in the effort are big passive vehicles like the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund.  The fund held about 2 percent of Tesla\u2019s shares at June 30. The fund\u2019s holdings are based on an index tracking shares on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, according to its prospectus.  Vanguard spokeswoman Carolyn Wegemann declined to comment on Tesla but said by email, \u201cAs private companies are not included in indexes, any shares held in an index fund when a company goes private would likely be sold\/tendered.\u201d  A factor that could work in Musk\u2019s favor is that more of his top fund investors are active stockpickers. Active funds would generally have more leeway to continue to own Tesla after a go-private transaction.  According to researcher Morningstar, 19 percent of Tesla\u2019s fund ownership rests in passive portfolios, compared with 28 percent at General Motors Co and 56 percent at Ford Motor Co.  Tesla\u2019s largest active fund investors include some that have held private companies such as Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund. At June 29 it held securities of private companies like Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc according to a disclosure. A Fidelity spokeswoman declined to comment.  Private shares can be illiquid and hard to price, raising concerns of whether they are appropriate for public portfolios.  David Barclay, chief operating officer of the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business, said he knew of no case of a security remaining in an index fund after it went private.

Last week Tesla told some holders of Model 3 reservations that they would not get their cars until 2019, eliciting howls of complaint on Tesla online fan forums. Tesla declined to comment.  GM dealers in California, the top U.S. market for electric vehicles, say brisk demand for Bolts is driven in part by frustrated Tesla buyers who are afraid they will lose a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit if they wait. The tax credit drops in value and eventually disappears once Tesla sells 200,000 electric vehicles in the United States, which Edmunds analyst Jeremy Acevedo expects Tesla to hit by the fall.  Tesla\u2019s Model 3 production troubles give rival auto makers a chance to snatch customers. Tesla has said that the net number of refundable $1,000 reservations for Model 3s was stable late last year and grew in recent weeks, with hundreds of thousands in line. But some buyers are running out of time or patience.  Chevrolet dealer Yev Kaplinskiy said his dealership located between San Francisco and Silicon Valley sold 15 Bolts last weekend, after Tesla\u2019s latest delay.  \u201cWe\u2019re getting the Tesla people who wanted their Model 3,\u201d Kaplinskiy said. \u201cWe ask them, \u2018What other cars are you interested in?\u2019 They\u2019re mostly Tesla. But they want the car now. They don\u2019t want to wait.\u201d Some of the weekend buyers had turned to Chevy because of the most recent Tesla delay, he said.  Chevrolet sent an email to some prospective buyers this week, announcing in bold case, \u201cBolt EV: Now available.\u201d  The Bolt and Model 3 both start at about $35,000 and can travel more than 200 miles (322 km) on an electric charge, although the Tesla and its Chief Executive Elon Musk have received much more media attention.  While Tesla is struggling with production of the Model 3, GM sold 23,297 Bolts in 2017, with monthly sales mostly rising. Kelley Blue Book reported that Bolts are in relatively short supply as measured by days in inventory, which fell to 42 in January from a high of 65 in August. By comparison, the Nissan Motor Co Ltd Leaf, an electric car with shorter range, was in inventory for 202 days.  For a graphic on 2017 Bolt sales, click here: reut.rs\/2sxeVt9  Last Wednesday, some of those who made early reservations for the base version Model 3 received emails from Tesla saying their vehicles would not be delivered until early 2019, delayed from 2018.  \u201cI\u2019m feeling extremely fleeced by Elon - guy secured an interest free loan from me (reservation payment) for a car I hadn\u2019t seen before reserving, and just told me that it might be another year before I should receive it,\u201d wrote one person from Seattle, \u201c206er\u201d, who was among a handful on TeslaMotorsClub.com saying they were cancelling reservations after the new delay.  Reuters was unable to contact the posters or confirm that they were cancelling reservations.  \u201cMy objective...was always a $35,000 Tesla for the price of a decently optioned Civic (with full federal tax credit),\u201d 206er added.  Tesla is closing in on 200,000 U.S. electric vehicle sales thanks to the popularity of its luxury Model S sedan and Model X SUV. If it hits 200,000 U.S. electric vehicle sales in the third quarter, then the $7,500 tax credit would phase out in stages over 2019. GM also is getting close to the limit, having sold nearly 170,000 plug-in cars, including Bolts, Volts and others, through the end of last year, Green Car Reports estimated.  Sonoma Chevrolet General Manager Ken Scholl, said the subsidy had been a key draw for Bolts and a concern for those who had given up on a Tesla. \u201cIf I had 50 (Bolts) in December, we would have sold every one,\u201d he said.","386":"March 13 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc:  * TESLA SAYS BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE \u201cFOR\u201d THE CEO PERFORMANCE AWARD - SEC FILING Source text: (bit.ly\/2Fwvco9) Further company coverage:","387":"(Reuters) - Walmart Inc WMT.N has sued Tesla Inc TSLA.O, accusing it of \"years of gross negligence and failure to live up to industry standards\" that led to several fires at its stores with Tesla solar systems.  FILE PHOTO: Walmart's logo is seen outside one of the stores in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., November 20, 2018. REUTERS\/Kamil Krzaczynski  Walmart hired SolarCity to install solar panel systems on at least 244 of its stores. Tesla bought SolarCity in 2016, and Walmart alleges that Tesla did not fix the problems it inherited and was negligent itself.  Tesla has not responded to requests for comment or filed a response to the lawsuit. In Walmart\u2019s August 20 filing, though, the U.S. retailer describes its view of how the fight developed over several years.  The following is a timeline based on Walmart\u2019s lawsuit:  2010-2016  Walmart signs at least 244 contracts for solar systems with the company later bought by Tesla.  August 2012-2017  Tesla solar panels cause fires at Walmart stores in Long Beach, California, Milpitas, California and Lakeside, Colorado. They are not treated as related or systematic problems.  March-May 2018  Walmart stores in Beavercreek, Ohio, Denton, Maryland and Indio, California experience roof fires. Hours before the Indio fire started, Tesla had dispatched personnel to the store; Walmart believes this was to attend to a possible alert.  Walmart and Tesla begin joint inspections of sites lasting until December 2018.  Over the course of Walmart inspections it says it finds hotspots in solar panels\u2019 cracked sheets, compromising electrical insulation. It blames Tesla for failing to properly \u2018hire, train and supervise\u2019 its contractors.  It found Tesla put wires near sharp points and metal edges, used incorrect connectors that built up heat and failed properly to tighten connectors, used plastic tools with insufficient strength and plumbing tools, and improperly grounded systems, and kept poor records. During inspections, Walmart said, Tesla searched for problems with drones that lacked sufficient resolution to find panel \u201chotspots\u201d and put tape on hotspots which exacerbated heat buildup.  By August 2019, Walmart says it received 29 inspection reports from Tesla itself. Those identified 157 \u201caction items\u201d, 48 of which Tesla characterizes as \u201creflecting conditions that rendered the sites unsafe or potentially unsafe\u201d. Issues include improper wiring, poor grounding, broken solar panels with \u2018hotspots\u201d.  May 31-June 1, 2018  Walmart demands Tesla disconnect all of the solar systems, says that agreements materially breached. Tesla responds that it did not breach contract but agrees that it would be \u201cprudent\u201d to disconnect, inspect and fix systems. It subsequently disconnects the systems.  November 29, 2018  Walmart discovers a roof fire from a disconnected solar panel system on a store in Yuba City, California, due to sparking wires after insulation degrated.  Walmart says Tesla did not inform it about a ground fault alert it received between June 5 and Sept. 11, that year, at the same store. Walmart said such issues revealed Tesla\u2019s \u201cutter incompetence or callousness, or both.\u201d  January 2019  Tesla tells Walmart it has significantly enhanced its inspection protocols and begun a renewed series of site inspections aimed at reconnecting solar systems.  July 2019  Walmart concludes that Tesla is not doing what is needed to ensure safety. It sends its second notice of breach of contract and gives it 30 days to fix. Tesla responds to Walmart with what the retailer called \u201cunsubstantiated allegations\u201d, says fires were \u201cregrettable\u201d and that some issues did exist. It says it is willing to satisfy most of the requirements by Walmart.  Walmart concludes its plan is \u201cboilerplate\u201d and falls short.  August 2019  Walmart and Tesla trade letters. On Aug 20, Walmart files lawsuit against Tesla in New York State Supreme Court. It says: \u201cTesla has not reacted with the urgency that one would expect from a company that had installed solar panels that were catching on fire. Far from it: Tesla\u2019s cavalier responses have only confirmed Walmart\u2019s worries that its contractual counterparty is incapable of providing maintenance and inspection services sufficient to ensure the safety of Walmart\u2019s customers, employees, and property\u201d.","388":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Owning electric carmaker Tesla Inc\u2019s shares is close to the riskiest it has ever been, data by options database and analytics firm OptionMetrics showed on Wednesday.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  More than a month since Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted a proposal to take the company private, only to abandon the idea in subsequent weeks, traders in the options market remain nervous.  Tesla\u2019s one-month implied volatility skew, a measure of investor sentiment toward downside risk, is at about 14 percent, not far from a record high, according to the firm\u2019s data.  \u201cIf you own a long position in Tesla and you wanted to hedge it with an out-of-the-money put, it\u2019s becoming more and more expensive,\u201d said Garrett DeSimone, head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics.  Buying of put options conveys the right to sell shares at a fixed price in the future. Out-of-the-money puts are contracts that make money if the stock drops and are typically used by investors to protect against a fall in the share price.  \u201cIt is an indication that the market is concerned about large downside risk,\u201d said DeSimone.  One-month skew shot up as high as 18.5 percent in late August and has largely remained elevated since then. The only other time the measure was higher was in March, following a credit downgrade of the electric car maker by Moody\u2019s Investors Service.  The recent departure of two high-level executives, media reports of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe into Musk\u2019s tweets and the CEO being filmed smoking marijuana and wielding a sword on a webcast have weighed on Tesla\u2019s share price.  Tesla stock is down about 25 percent from the multi-month high of $387.46 reached on Aug 7. On Wednesday, the shares were up 3.2 percent.  Investors\u2019 skepticism about the fate of the shares is evident in the accumulation of large number of put contracts at the $50 strike price, expiring in September and mid-January.  The contracts make up the two largest blocks of open Tesla options and account for about 8 percent of all open Tesla contracts.  Put contracts conveying the right to sell the shares at $50 by Sept. 21, have grown to nearly 100,000 contracts from 37,000 contracts on Aug. 6, according to Thomson Reuters data. The January $50 puts have also logged an 11 percent increase over the same period.  \u201cI think it is the non-believers expressing their outlook that Tesla\u2019s stock price may be much lower,\u201d said Matt Amberson, founder at Chicago-based volatility and options data firm ORATS.  \u201cThe stock does not need to go down all the way to $50. If the stock went down quickly, the January 50 puts would rocket higher in value,\u201d he said.  The contracts may also reflect players in the credit market looking to hedge their risk, analysts said.  \u201cIf you own a lot of credit-related instruments in Tesla, a way of hedging the long-term value of that credit would be to buy put options,\u201d said DeSimone.  Tesla bonds have slumped in recent weeks on worries about Tesla\u2019s ability to generate cash to pay back debt.

The highly influential nonprofit organization, which tests and rates a variety of consumer products from appliances to vehicles, said it compared Cadillac\u2019s Super Cruise and Tesla\u2019s Autopilot with similar systems from Nissan Motor Co and Zhejiang Geely\u2019s Volvo Car Corp. Nissan\u2019s ProPilot Assist was ranked third and Volvo\u2019s Pilot Assist fourth.  Consumer Reports said it has been testing partially automated driving systems for several years but elected to conduct a formal study intended for publication, because \u201cwe are at a tipping point where they are now going mainstream,\u201d according to Jake Fisher, director of auto testing.  The organization said its tests, conducted on a private track and on public roads in Connecticut, were designed to measure the systems\u2019 ability to automatically control steering and speed in certain situations, while helping drivers pay attention and regain manual control of the vehicle when required.  The systems typically use cameras, radar and other sensors, as well as mapping data, to monitor location and traffic conditions and help keep a vehicle centered in the lane at a safe distance behind other cars.  Each system has limitations. Cadillac\u2019s Super Cruise, for instance, only functions on divided highways that have been mapped by GM. In contrast, Tesla\u2019s Autopilot can be used even on small, curvy roads with poor lane markings, but \u201coperates erratically in those situations,\u201d Consumer Reports said.  While they can help relieve driver stress and fatigue, Consumer Reports said, the partially automated systems are \u201cnot intended to be self-driving features.\u201d  The organization tested Super Cruise on the Cadillac CT6; Autopilot on the Tesla Model 3, Model X and Model S; ProPilot Assist on the Nissan Leaf and Infiniti QX50, and Pilot Assist on the Volvo XC40 and XC60.  Consumer Reports said Cadillac\u2019s Super Cruise did \u201cthe best job of balancing high-tech capabilities with ensuring the car is operated safely and the driver is paying attention.\u201d  Tesla\u2019s Autopilot was cited for its capability and ease of use, while Nissan\u2019s ProPilot Assist did a better job than Autopilot or Volvo\u2019s Pilot Assist in keeping drivers engaged.

REUTERS\/Tyrone Siu\/File Photo  With investors betting Tesla will soon raise capital, the stock fell 14% for the week to its lowest since January 2017, before the launch of the Model 3 sedan aimed at making the electric car maker profitable.  It was the worst weekly drop for Tesla since August last year, when Musk told the New York Times in a tearful interview that he was under major emotional stress.  In the options market, Tesla contracts changed hands at twice the usual pace, with sentiment leaning toward defensive bets, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.  Tesla\u2019s $1.8 billion junk bond sank half a cent to yield 8.42%, more than 3 percentage points above the bond\u2019s coupon rate of 5.3%. Its spread, or the premium investors demand for the added risk of holding Tesla debt rather than a safer U.S. Treasury security, widened by about 15 basis points to a near-record 611 basis points.  One positive development for Tesla: a U.S. District Court judge on Friday granted a request by Musk and the Securities and Exchange Commission for a second extension to resolve a dispute over Musk\u2019s use of Twitter.  On Wednesday, Tesla posted a worse-than-expected loss of $702 million for the March quarter. Musk said Tesla would return to profit in the third quarter and that there was \u201csome merit\u201d to raising capital.  (Graphic: Tesla's cash link: tmsnrt.rs\/2DyJjX6).  Musk is still battling to convince investors that demand for the Model 3, the company\u2019s first car aimed at the mass consumer market, is \u201cinsanely\u201d high, and that it can be delivered efficiently to customers around the world.  Tesla ended its first quarter with $2.2 billion in cash, down from $3.7 billion in the prior quarter, and the company is planning expansions including a Shanghai factory, an upcoming Model Y SUV, and other projects.  On Monday, Musk hosted a self-driving vehicle presentation, where he predicted Tesla would have over a million autonomous vehicles by next year. Some analysts perceived the presentation as a way to deflect attention from questions about demand, margin pressure, increasing competition and even Musk\u2019s ongoing battle with U.S. regulators.  Tesla\u2019s stock has now fallen 29 percent in 2019 and the company\u2019s market capitalization has declined to $41 billion from $63 billion in mid-December.

REUTERS\/Aly Song  (Reuters) - Tesla Inc will pay a 50-50 mix of stock and cash to holders of its bonds due in March, if they elect to convert the debt, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing a copy of the settlement notice.  Tesla has 0.25 percent convertible senior notes coming due in March. As of September 2018, it had an unpaid principal balance of $920,000.  Tesla declined to comment on the report.  Tesla\u2019s move to use both cash and equity to return debt suggests that the company, which in the past has struggled with cash burn, is on a sustained path to profitability.  The electric-car maker reported free cash flow of $881 million in its latest quarter - the first time since the third quarter of fiscal 2016 - and Chief Executive Officer Musk has said the company will be cash flow positive and profitable in all quarters going forward.  The company is expected to generate $390 million in free cash flow in the fourth quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.","393":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Thursday it would not be profitable in the first quarter, as it offered for the first time a $35,000 version of its Model 3 sedan and said its global sales would now be online-only, steps designed to increase demand and cut overhead costs for the electric vehicle maker.  Chief Executive Elon Musk\u2019s warning on profit during a conference call with members of the media, which did not include Reuters, contrasted with Tesla\u2019s statements last month that it was expecting a \u201cvery small\u201d net profit in the first quarter.  Shares of Tesla fell 3.4 percent after hours. Investors have voiced concerns about whether Tesla would be able to maintain profit margins through cost cutting - such as recent layoffs - as it reduces prices of its newest vehicle.  Still, the price drop could quell concerns from some analysts that demand for the higher-priced versions of the Model 3 was beginning to dry up in the United States, especially after a federal tax credit was cut in half this year.  \u201cTesla wants to drum up demand,\u201d said Elazar Advisors\u2019 Chaim Siegel. \u201cThere was a slowdown in the U.S. as the tax credits dropped. (There are) more tax credit hits later in the year too so they are trying to be proactive.\u201d  Musk has often shared that his strategy for Tesla was to build higher-priced cars - the Model S and X - whose success would ultimately usher in a $35,000 mass-market car, followed by an SUV, the Model Y, which is currently in development. But customers who reserved the Model 3 at that lower price have waited nearly three years since Musk first promised it.  An online-only sales strategy, along with other changes, would allow vehicle prices to fall by about 6 percent on average, Tesla said in a blog on its website bit.ly\/2IHjLw4. Over the next few months, Tesla will wind down \"many\" of its stores, while investing in its service system, it said.  Online-only sales represent a dramatic shift for the company that has prided itself on its boutique retail stores. In June 2017, Musk pledged to increase the number of stores, saying they had \u201cbarely touched the surface\u201d of what was possible.  As of the fourth quarter, Tesla said it recently opened 27 new locations, bringing its total of stores and service centers to 378.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Thursday was the third time this year that Tesla lowered the price on the Model 3, which recently started at $42,900.  The new $35,000 version has a top speed of 130 miles per hour (209 km per hour) and can go from zero to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds, Tesla said. For $2,000 more, Tesla offers a version with a range of 240 miles (386 km) and a top speed of 140 mph.  GAME CHANGER WITH SPEED BUMPS  A $35,000 Model 3 is a major shot in the arm for Tesla sales during a period of major challenges, including deliveries of the Model 3 to Europe and China and construction of a factory in Shanghai.  \u201cThis is a game changer,\u201d said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives. Since tax credits will continue to decline over 2019, \u201cthis is really exactly what the doctor ordered,\u201d he said.  He warned, however, there could be \u201cmore speed bumps ahead,\u201d if more sales volume exacerbates prior problems with deliveries and service to customers.  Musk declined to answer a question on what the profit margins of the $35,000 vehicle would be, according to the New York Times. Gross margins on the car were above 20 percent in the fourth quarter.  \u201cThe margin on the vehicle obviously is going to be very small if there\u2019s any margin there at all,\u201d said David Kudla, CEO of Mainstay Capital Management, which has a short position in Tesla.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  As part of cost-cutting efforts, Tesla last month reduced its full-time headcount by 7 percent, following a similar cut of 9 percent to its workforce in June 2018.  The price cut on the Model 3 comes three days after renewed tensions between Musk and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The agency petitioned a judge this week to have Tesla\u2019s CEO found in contempt of an October settlement between the parties. The SEC accuses Musk of having made material statements about production levels on Twitter without first having them vetted internally.  That settlement between Musk, Tesla and the SEC concerned Musk\u2019s August Twitter post in which he claimed to have \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private at $420 per share.  On Friday, Tesla is due to repay a $920 million convertible bond. Convertible issues give bondholders the right to trade their debt for equity after shares rise over a certain price. Tesla shares are currently about $40 below the $359.87 conversion price.  Tesla had $3.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of December.","394":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Wednesday said its solar factory in Buffalo, New York, would become the \u201cmanufacturing home\u201d for its electric vehicle Supercharger cabinets and other energy storage products as it seeks to meet employment targets tied to state subsidies.

But the company must add hundreds more workers in New York to meet next year\u2019s target.  Tesla employs 329 workers at the factory and about 300 others elsewhere in the state, the report said. It was required to have at least 500 employees in the state by April 30 of this year in exchange for $750 million in subsidies for the Buffalo facility, which is known as the RiverBend factory.  By this time next year, it must employ 1,460 workers in the state, including 500 at the factory, according to Empire State Development, the state\u2019s economic development arm.  Tesla also said it has invested $381.9 million total in New York state as of April 30, including $179.3 million in the previous year.  \u201cWe\u2019re committed to investing in Buffalo and the State,\u201d Tesla said in an emailed statement.  Tesla\u2019s manufacturing partner, Panasonic Corp, has about 400 employees at the Buffalo plant. It was not immediately clear whether those jobs are included in the count toward meeting the state targets. Panasonic manufactures solar cells and assembles panels at the factory for Tesla and others.  \u201cWe are pleased that Tesla is reporting that it has exceeded its job and investment commitments,\u201d Pamm Lent, spokeswoman for Empire State Development, said in an emailed statement. \u201cIn the coming weeks, ESD will perform the necessary due diligence to verify the data provided by Tesla.\u201d  Tesla\u2019s plan to manufacture solar products in New York has come under scrutiny as the company drastically scaled back the U.S. solar business it acquired in 2016 with the $2.6 billion purchase of SolarCity.  At the time, it planned to use the factory to make a trailblazing product called the Solar Roof, an energy system meant to look like normal roof tiles. But that product has been far slower to reach the market than promised, and Panasonic is shipping most of the cells originally intended for the Solar Roof to customers overseas. Panasonic has also sought other customers for its Buffalo-made panels.","395":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Friday asked a court to dismiss a securities fraud lawsuit by shareholders who said the electric vehicle maker gave false public statements about the progress of producing its new Model 3 sedan.  A Tesla dealership is seen in West Drayton, just outside London, Britain, February 7, 2018. REUTERS\/Hannah McKay  In a filing in federal court in San Francisco, Tesla said that its statements about the challenges the company faced with Model 3 were \u201cfrank and in plain language,\u201d including repeated disclosures by Chief Executive Elon Musk of \u201cproduction hell.\u201d  Tesla did not seek to hide the truth, its motion to dismiss said.  The company says its Model 3 has experienced numerous \u201cbottlenecks\u201d from problems with Tesla\u2019s battery module process at its Nevada Gigafactory to general assembly at its Fremont plant.  Tesla is under pressure to deliver the Model 3 to reap revenue and stem massive spending that has put Tesla\u2019s finances in the red. The ramp of the Model 3, Tesla said in the court filing, was \u201cthe first of its kind,\u201d with difficulties likely to crop up after it got underway.  The lawsuit filed last October seeks class action status for shareholders who bought Tesla stock between May 4, 2016 through October 6, 2017, inclusive. It said shareholders bought \u201cartificially inflated\u201d shares because Musk and other executives misled them with their statements.  Tesla made such statements during the lead-up to, and early production of, its Model 3 sedan and failed to disclose that the company was \u201cwoefully unprepared\u201d for the vehicle\u2019s production, the lawsuit said.  A hearing is scheduled for August.  The Tesla response chronicled disclosures of production bottlenecks the company faced in its third quarter of 2017 when it fell short of its targets.  Tesla\u2019s statements that its Model 3 production was \u201con track\u201d in May and August of 2017 - which plaintiffs argue were false - were made before production problems began to surface, Tesla argued.  Tesla said its \u201cgood faith belief\u201d in the Model 3 program is reflected in everything it has done: a $4 billion investment, the build-out of its Gigafactory battery factory in Nevada and the high-volume equipment it commissioned.","396":"FILE PHOTO: Elon Musk wears a protective mask as he arrives to attend a meeting with the leadership of the conservative CDU\/CSU parliamentary group, in Berlin, Germany September 2, 2020.

Earlier this month a U.S. appeals court reversed a lower-court decision against Qualcomm, which makes technology for connecting devices to mobile data networks. The court also vacated an injunction that would have required Qualcomm to change its patent licensing practices.  Qualcomm was fighting a May 2019 decision by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, in a case brought by the FTC. Koh sided with the FTC, writing that Qualcomm\u2019s practice of requiring phone makers to sign a patent license agreement before selling them chips \u201cstrangled competition\u201d and harmed consumers.  Automakers have increasingly put chips in vehicles to connect them to the internet, which requires them to sign patent agreements for communications standards such as 5G. The companies had previously argued that connected car prices could go up if Qualcomm won its case.  Qualcomm won its appeal of that ruling before the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in an Aug. 11 ruling by a three-judge panel. In a letter sent Monday, the automakers, as well as Qualcomm rivals Intel Corp INTC.O and MediaTek Inc 2454.TW, urged the FTC to seek an \"en banc\" rehearing of the case by the full appeals court.  \u201cIf allowed to stand, the panel\u2019s decision could destabilize  the standards ecosystem by encouraging the abuse of market power acquired through collaborative standard-setting,\u201d the group said.

The company\u2019s shares fell 8.7 percent, with four Wall Street brokerages cutting their price targets on the stock after deliveries of Tesla\u2019s higher-priced luxury cars - Model S and X - more than halved in the first quarter.  The implications of slowing deliveries on cash flow for a company saddled with billions of dollars in debt rattled bond investors, pushing the price of its $1.8 billion junk bond down by the most in seven months.  RBC analysts called Model S\/X deliveries \u201cvery disappointing\u201d and estimated the numbers would translate to a more than $1 billion shortfall in revenue compared to previous estimates.  The company had flagged in February that it expected to post a first-quarter loss as it launched its cheaper $35,000 version of the Model 3 sedan.  Musk, who is under pressure to deliver Model 3 to new international markets efficiently, has been engaged in a public disagreement with U.S. regulators stemming from his tweets about Tesla\u2019s production estimates.  His lawyers will argue on Thursday that he did not violate a fraud settlement with the U.S. SEC and should not be held in contempt, the latest twist in a high-profile battle between the billionaire and the government. [nL1N21L0WY]  \u201cWith Musk due in court to face the SEC imminently, Tesla remains one of the most absorbing companies we cover, and one which for good or ill, never ceases to surprise,\u201d Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Nicholas Hyett said before a Manhattan federal court hearing.  Musk\u2019s fight with the SEC has raised investor worries that it could lead to restrictions on his activities or even his removal from Tesla, while distracting him at a pivotal point in the company\u2019s expansion.  In the quarter, Tesla delivered 50,900 Model 3s, the linchpin of its growth strategy, falling short of analysts\u2019 estimate of 58,900, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Tesla also pinned the blame for the first-quarter delivery drop to longer transit times, which analysts said could impact cash flow, even though the company claimed it had sufficient cash on hand.  The company said it had delivered only half of the quarter\u2019s numbers by March 21, with 10,600 vehicles still in transit at the end of the quarter. By comparison, only 1,900 vehicles were in transit at the end of the fourth quarter.  Cowen and Co analysts said that the delivery and transit details suggested \u201ccash was likely dangerously low\u201d after Tesla paid off a $920 million convertible bond obligation in cash in the beginning of March.

Transporting equipment for a production line by air is costly and hardly ever done in the automotive industry, and the move underscores Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk\u2019s urgency to get a grip on manufacturing problems that have hobbled the launch of the high-volume Model 3 and pushed Tesla\u2019s finances deep into the red.  \u201cAs usual with Tesla, everything is being done in a massive hurry and money seems to be no obstacle,\u201d said one of the two sources.  Tesla on Friday declined to comment on whether it has shipped in any new production equipment from Europe.  Investors are closely watching Tesla and its high-profile, often brash CEO to see if the upstart electric vehicle maker can pull off high-volume production of the Model 3, a car with the potential to catapult the niche automaker to a mass producer and assure its financial stability.  But manufacturing missteps have led Tesla to repeatedly miss production targets for the sedan, and raised doubts about Musk\u2019s promises that the company will stop burning cash by the third quarter of this year. Tesla had free cash flow of negative $1 billion in the first quarter, and earlier this month disclosed that it could offer its Fremont, California, vehicle assembly plant as collateral for debt.  Engineers from Tesla\u2019s German engineering arm, Grohmann, are now reworking the battery production line at the Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada, in a bid to free up bottlenecks, the person said. The line will become more automated gradually over time, added the source, who was not authorized to speak for attribution.  Musk first disclosed plans for this line on a conference call with analysts in November, after complaining of problems with an original line built by a subcontractor.  Musk has told investors the new battery production line will help the carmaker achieve a quantum leap in productivity. The company has noted, however, that it will still be able to reach its target of building 5,000 Model 3s per week by June without the addition of the new line.

REUTERS\/James Glover II  But Tesla\u2019s lack of consistency in its factories has undercut Musk\u2019s production promises in the past.  Under time pressure to fix problems, Musk has now insisted the new production line should be a no-expenses-spared effort, the source said. That led to the decision to airlift the new production equipment to the United States from Europe, a step carmakers usually avoid by planning production equipment installations months or years ahead of a production launch.  The shipments of new equipment began arriving in Reno this week, the two sources told Reuters.  It is not clear when the new production system will be ready to start running. Robots frequently need to be recalibrated to adjust for minimal differences in the quality of raw materials they are working with or temperature and humidity differences. Steps to test the quality of materials and recalibrate robots have proven to be a bottleneck that Tesla managers had underestimated, the first source said.  Musk has repeatedly complained of \u201cmanufacturing hell\u201d trying to ramp up the Model 3, which began production, albeit slowly, last July.  In February, Musk said the main bottleneck was still its battery module production, saying Tesla had become \u201ca little overconfident, a little complacent\u201d in its ability to execute.  The Gigafactory\u2019s battery production is divided into four zones, two of which have experienced problems. Responsibility for two of these zones was originally delegated to subcontractors specialized in integrating complex systems, Musk said.  \u201cWe were promised they would work, and it just didn\u2019t work,\u201d Musk said during a February conference call. A new design for an automated system for those zones was nearing completion, Musk said in November, adding that Grohmann was \u201cworking on the issue and making very rapid progress.\u201d  One of the problems, both at the Gigafactory and at Tesla\u2019s Fremont vehicle manufacturing factory, has been the interface between Tesla and the subcontractors it hires. Sources have told Reuters of communication problems and high managerial turnover, which complicate the execution of big projects.  Musk said in early May he planned to rid the company of \u201cbarnacles\u201d \u2013 contractors and subcontractors \u2013 saying Tesla\u2019s reliance on them had become \u201cout of control.\u201d","413":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O extended its rally on Thursday ahead of its December debut in the S&P 500 .SPX, with its market value nearing $500 billion, highlighting the growing domination of mega-cap growth stocks within Wall Street's main benchmark.

FILE PHOTO: A Panasonic Corp's lithium-ion battery, which is part of Tesla Motor Inc's Model S and Model X battery packs, is pictured with the Tesla Motors logo during a photo opportunity at the Panasonic Center in Tokyo, Japan, November 19, 2013. REUTERS\/Yuya Shino\/File Photo  The Japanese electronics maker, the exclusive supplier of batteries to Tesla Inc TSLA.O, made the comments following questions from Reuters about whether the batteries contained Cuban cobalt.  Two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that some of the cobalt that Panasonic uses to make Tesla's batteries is mined in Cuba by Canadian supplier Sherritt International Corp S.TO.  Panasonic said it was unable to tell how much cobalt sourced from Cuba via its Canadian supplier ended up in the batteries it provided to the U.S. market \u201cdue to co-mingling of sources by its suppliers in several phases of manufacturing processes\u201d.  \u201cPanasonic has chosen to suspend its relationship with its Canadian supplier,\u201d a spokeswoman said, without naming the supplier. She added that Panasonic had used cobalt from the Canadian supplier for batteries used in the Tesla Model S and Model X, but only after February this year.  \u201cPanasonic has sought guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) regarding its interpretation of the scope of the U.S. ban on Cuban-origin imports,\u201d she said.  A U.S. Treasury official, who asked not to be named, said Treasury does not discuss investigations and could not confirm whether one existed.  The United States imposed sanctions on Cuba after Fidel Castro nationalized swathes of American assets more than 50 years ago.  Tesla, when asked for comment by Reuters, did not address questions about whether its batteries contained Cuban cobalt or whether that could potentially put the company in breach of sanctions.  A spokesman said: \u201cTesla is aiming to achieve close to zero usage of cobalt in the near future.\u201d  The electric vehicle maker, run by billionaire Elon Musk, said in May that it had been working for years to reduce the amount of cobalt it uses in its batteries.  Sherritt declined to comment on questions about whether it sold cobalt to Panasonic.  \u201cWe don\u2019t respond to questions about specific client activities,\u201d Sherritt\u2019s spokesman Joe Racanelli said.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been working in Cuba for 25 years and we sell our Class 1 nickel and cobalt that\u2019s refined from our facility in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, to customers in Europe and Asia.\u201d  SCRAMBLE FOR RESOURCES  An anticipated electric vehicle revolution has sent demand and prices for cobalt - a crucial component in car batteries - surging over the past two years.  Companies are under pressure to prove that the minerals they consume are sourced from mines that do not employ children or cause major environmental damage. Global cobalt supply is dominated by the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is riven by conflict and political instability.  Sherritt produces Cobalt at the Moa mine in Cuba, a 50-50 joint venture between the Canadian company and the state-owned General Nickel Company of Cuba.  Panasonic buys cobalt from Sherritt and the metal is then turned into specialized cobalt chemicals by a contractor, according to the sources.  Panasonic is also supplied with cobalt chemicals by Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd 5713.T, which produces most of its material in the Philippines, the sources said.  The sources said that Sumitomo supplied the bulk of the cobalt used in Tesla batteries. Reuters was unable to determine what proportion of the cobalt used in Panasonic\u2019s batteries made for Tesla came from Sherritt.  Sumitomo declined to comment on its supply chain.  When asked about a potential cobalt supply crunch, a Panasonic spokeswoman said, after the Reuters report, that the company \u201cwill secure its demand of cobalt from existing and new sources\u201d. The procurement from the Canadian supplier it suspended was not a majority, she added.","415":"BEIJING, Aug 30 (Reuters) - China will exempt 16 Tesla Inc electric vehicle (EV) models from purchase tax, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said in a statement on its website.

FRANKFURT, Nov 14 (Reuters) - To unclog bottlenecks last year at his Tesla Inc plant in California, Elon Musk flew in six planeloads of new robots and equipment from Germany to speed up battery production for its Model 3.  Now the Tesla CEO is trying to tap that German automation ecosystem directly with Tuesday\u2019s announcement that the electric carmaker will build a European car and battery factory near Berlin.  So far, Musk has failed in his plans to create a factory so highly automated that it allows Tesla to make cars more efficiently than much bigger rivals. As a result, the automaker has struggled to meet production goals and been hit with defections of key staff members to rival firms.  The new German factory is designed to help change all that.  \u201cEveryone knows German engineering is outstanding for sure. You know that is part of the reason why we are locating Gigafactory Europe in Germany,\u201d Musk said at a prestigious German car awards ceremony in Berlin late on Tuesday.  BMW has a factory in Leipzig, where it builds its i3 electric vehicle and it will source battery cells from a factory in Erfurt run by China\u2019s Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL)..  VW is retooling a plant in Zwickau to build 330,000 electric cars and German engineering giant Siemens AG, which has an industrial and technology hub in Berlin, last week said it met with Musk to discuss projects in the area of advanced manufacturing and car charging.  German carmakers and suppliers are tapping in to a 1 billion euro ($1.10 billion) fund set up by Germany to increase battery cell production and are further aided by a government-funded research facility to increase battery cell development know-how.  PRODUCTION GOAL  Tesla has yet to meet its goal of building more than 500,000 Model 3 cars by 2018. That goal was set back in 2016 and since then Tesla\u2019s production guru, Peter Hochholdinger, a former Audi production expert, quit to joined rival Lucid.  This year Tesla expects to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars, a target that includes selling all models.  By contrast, the Volkswagen brand delivered 6.24 million cars last year and is readying its global production network to build 22 million electric cars by 2028.  To ramp up manufacturing, Tesla started making its Model 3 in a tent, but the California-built cars often failed to meet German quality standards. In August, German car rental company Nextmove walked away from a 5 million-euro ($5.55 million) order for 85 Tesla Model 3 electric vehicles, following a dispute over how to fix quality issues.  POTENTIAL FOR AUTOMATION  Although Tesla has chosen a high-cost location, there is higher potential for automation with electric cars since they are less complex to build than combustion engined vehicles.  A combustion engined car has 1,400 components in the motor, exhaust system and transmission. By contrast, an electric car\u2019s battery and motor has only 200 components, according to analysts at ING.  While the average combustion engine takes 3.5 hours to make, and the average transmission requires 2.7 hours of assembly, an electric motor takes only about 1 hour to assemble, consultants at Alix Partners said in their Global Automotive Outlook study.  \u201cPersonnel is not a high cost factor in the production of electric cars,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said.  Today the biggest cost factor is still battery packs, which amount to between 30% and 50% of the cost of an electric vehicle.  QUALITY VS SCALE  By adding the \u201cMade in Germany\u201d quality, Tesla could significantly boost sales of its electric cars, which are already class-leading.

FILE PHOTO: Tesla CEO Elon Musk leaves Manhattan federal court after a hearing on his fraud settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in New York City, U.S., April 4, 2019. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  The letter cited a lack of demand, \u201cdesperate\u201d price cuts, layoffs, \u201cclosing-and-then-not-closing\u201d stores, closing service centers, slashing capital expenditures, rushed product announcements and \u201ca new effort to distract investors from the demand problem with hyperbole over TSLA\u2019s autonomous driving capabilities.\u201d  \u201cWe believe that right here, right now, the company appears to again be on the brink,\u201d the letter said. Greenlight is short Tesla stock, recently a profitable bet. Tesla\u2019s share price declined from $332.80 to $279.86 in the first quarter. On Friday, shares of Tesla were trading around $268 per share.  Tesla did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  Greenlight said its funds gained 11 percent over the first three months of 2019, slightly below the gain of the S&P 500 Index. Despite the gains so far this year, \u201cit continued to be a challenging environment for our investment style with growth stocks performing much better than value stocks,\u201d the letter said.  \u201cIn the context of this headwind and a sizable short portfolio, we are pleased with the quarterly result,\u201d it added.  Greenlight noted that last summer, Musk had promised Tesla would be profitable and cash flow positive in every quarter going forward. \u201cHe repeated that forecast as recently as the end of January,\u201d Greenlight said.  \u201cThat promise has failed to materialize. The question at hand is: in a few months will Musk be again bragging that he saved the company from the brink of failure, or will TSLA in fact fail this time?\u201d  Greenlight Capital and its founder Einhorn first rose to prominence for making a prescient call on Lehman Brothers\u2019 accounting troubles before the firm\u2019s collapse. Late last year, Greenlight compared Tesla to Lehman.  In Greenlight\u2019s letter, Einhorn said the fund\u2019s biggest gainers during the first quarter included AerCap Holdings, Brighthouse Financial, Deutsche Pfandbriefbank, General Motors and Green Brick Partners.  Einhorn said Brighthouse has been misunderstood because GAAP accounting requires that hedges get marked to market each quarter while liabilities are not.  \u201cThis creates a mismatch between how BHF\u2019s assets and liabilities are treated in response to market moves,\u201d Einhorn said. \u201cAll else being equal, BHF benefits from rising equity markets and higher interest rates, as the economic gain from lower expected claims more than offsets the company\u2019s losses on its hedges.\u201d","427":"MOSCOW, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Russia\u2019s main unofficial Tesla dealer hopes zero customs fees will lift sales of the U.S. vehicles, despite their relatively high price and a fledgling charging infrastructure.  Only 353 new electric cars were sold in Russia last year, including 81 Teslas, data from Autostat shows.  While Tesla has not officially entered the Russian market, Tesla Club helps customers, including businessmen and politicians, buy the cars abroad and maintain them.  The majority of electric vehicles sold in Russia, where there are significantly fewer charging points for electric vehicles than in Europe or the United States, were Nissan Leaf and Jaguar I-Pace vehicles.  \u201cCustoms fees have decreased, so demand has increased. People took it very well,\u201d Alexei Eremchuk, head of Tesla Club, Russia\u2019s unofficial dealership in Moscow, told Reuters.  Moscow cut customs fees for electric cars to zero from May, down from 48-54% for individuals and 15% for legal entities.  \u201cThis year the (Tesla) fleet (in Russia) may easily increase by 1,000 cars, including used ones,\u201d Eremchuk told Reuters.

The board announced the move in Tesla\u2019s first filing with regulators since Musk tweeted a week ago that he was considering taking the company private and had already secured funding for a $420-per-share offer, valuing Tesla at $72 billion.  Since that unorthodox announcement on Aug. 7, which has triggered investor lawsuits and an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Musk and Tesla have scrambled to bring order to the process of negotiating a deal.  Musk tweeted on Monday he was working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc and private equity firm Silver Lake as financial advisers. However, as of Tuesday, Goldman Sachs was still negotiating its terms of engagement with Musk, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Silver Lake was also not signed up officially as a financial adviser, as it is helping Musk explore how to take Tesla private with no compensation, Reuters reported on Monday.  Goldman Sachs and Silver lake declined to comment.  Musk\u2019s effort to associate his potential bid with some of Wall Street\u2019s most venerable institutions, even at the risk of misrepresenting their involvement, comes as pressure has been building on him to justify his pronouncement last week that funding for a deal had been \u201csecured.\u201d  Musk said on Monday he had held talks with a Saudi sovereign fund on a buyout that would take Tesla off the Nasdaq exchange - an extraordinary move for what is now the United States\u2019 most valuable automaker. Tesla has a market value of $60 billion, bigger than Detroit rivals General Motors Co or Ford Motor Co, which produce far more cars.  Tesla shares closed down 2.5 percent at $347.64 on Tuesday. They are still above $341.99, their closing price the day before Musk tweeted his plan to take Tesla private, which pushed the shares up 11 percent to an 11-month high.  NO FORMAL PROPOSAL  Tesla said in its statement on Tuesday the special committee had the authority to take any action on behalf of the board to evaluate and negotiate a potential transaction and alternatives to any transaction proposed by Musk.  That means three members of Tesla\u2019s board will now weigh whether it is advisable - or even feasible - to pursue what could be the biggest-ever go-private deal, and they are doing so before receiving a formal proposal from the CEO.  Musk has yet to persuade Wall Street analysts and investors that he can find the billions needed to complete the deal, or even such a deal is a good idea for a loss-making company.  \u201cDespite Elon Musk\u2019s frustration with being a public company, I think there are more advantages to remaining public,\u201d said CFRA analyst Efraim Levy, citing cheaper access to capital and media exposure due to interest in a public company.  Chaim Siegel, an analyst at Elazar Advisors, said it would be better for Tesla to remain a public company so investors can benefit from an \u201cearnings inflection\u201d if Musk fulfills his promise of making the company profitable later this year.

But corporate governance and shareholder voting advisers Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services said they do not consider Buss an independent director, due to his connections to solar panel installer SolarCity, which Tesla bought two years ago.  Denholm, the first woman on Tesla\u2019s board, is chief operations officer of telecom firm Telstra and the former chief financial officer of network gear maker Juniper Networks.

Volkswagen is readying two Chinese factories to build electric cars next year. The Chinese plants will have a production capacity of 600,000 vehicles, according to Volkswagen\u2019s plans, which have not been previously reported - revealing VW\u2019s ability to industrialise production faster than other pioneers in the electric vehicle market.  Tesla is still trying to reach its goal of making more than 500,000 cars a year by building a new factory in Shanghai, China, while VW can rely on an established workforce in two of its plants in Anting and Foshun to build zero-emission cars.  The scale and speed of VW\u2019s electrification push marks a shift in favour of established manufacturers that can use existing factories and profit from combustion-engined sport utility vehicles (SUVs) to scale up faster than startups.  \u201cThe truth is barriers to entry in autos remain high,\u201d said Max Warburton, an analyst at Bernstein Research. \u201cMaking cars is hard. The move to electric vehicles will be expensive, but will probably be led by traditional manufacturers.\u201d  VW is leveraging its large infrastructure of suppliers, factories and workers, long a handicap to its profitability, more aggressively than rivals BMW, Renault SA , General Motors Co and Tesla, which were all quicker to sell a custom-designed electric car.  Rather than adjusting production gradually, and using multi-powertrain platforms, Volkswagen is making a massive bet on a dedicated electric vehicle architecture, known as MEB, in the hope of increasing economies of scale sufficiently to push down the price of electric cars to around 20,000 euros ($22,262).  The Wolfsburg, Germany-based carmaker is retooling eight plants across the globe by 2022 to specialise in manufacturing electric cars, and license its electric MEB platform to rivals, senior VW executives told Reuters, putting it on track to become the world\u2019s largest maker of zero-emission vehicles.  Tesla has emerged as a serious competitor with a credible car, its Model 3, Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess told Reuters last week. But startups have a hard time entering mass production without sufficient production facilities, he said.  \u201cThe question is, can you expand your production quickly enough? The capital intensity is increasing,\u201d Diess said.  To fund its own electrification shift, the German carmaker aims to increase sales of VW SUVs, with combustion engines, to 40% of overall sales by 2020 from 23% in 2018.  The powerstation that supplies energy for VW\u2019s flagship e-vehicle factory in Zwickau, Germany, marked by two tall chimneys, was built to power production of the combustion-engined Volkswagen Golf.  Now Zwickau can piggyback off this infrastructure to ramp up production to 330,000 VW ID electric cars by 2021.  Volkswagen Group will increase economies of scale by rolling out electric vehicle platforms to its Audi, Skoda and Seat and Porsche brands.  Volkswagen Group will be in a position to build 22 million electric cars by 2028, of which 11.6 million could come out of Chinese factories, VW said.  PRODUCTION PAIN  VW\u2019s expansion push comes at a time when investors have started to question businesses delivering growth without real profit, a change in sentiment that is crippling the ability of several electric car pioneers to raise more cash.  Back in 2016, Tesla said it wanted to build more than 500,000 Model 3 cars by 2018, a goal it has failed to meet. This year it expects to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars, a target that includes selling all models.  Tesla\u2019s struggles have dampened optimism about how easy it is to enter the car business, making it harder for China\u2019s NIO, backed by internet company Tencent Holdings Ltd, as well as others like Faraday Future and Byton Ltd, to fund the next stage of growth: capital-intensive volume production and sales.  \u201cSo much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you.\u201d  After starting trial production runs at its factory in Shanghai, Tesla now hopes to reach its 500,000-vehicle target in the 12-month period ending June 30, 2020. Tesla is also looking for a site to start production in Europe.  Volkswagen is converting two German plants, Hanover and Zwickau, to build electric vehicles and will retool other factories including plants in China: Foshan which VW runs together with its joint-venture partner FAW-Volkswagen, and another in Anting, which VW runs together with SAIC.  It will retool plants in Emden and Dresden in Germany, Mlada Boleslav in the Czech Republic, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, in United States, as part of a 30 billion-euro ($33.24 billion)investment push into e-mobility by 2023.  As a result, Volkswagen Group will be the No. 1 electric vehicle producer globally by 2025, while Tesla is likely to remain a niche player, according to UBS autos analyst Patrick Hummel.  TECHNOLOGY INTERLOPERS  The cutthroat rivalry between automakers and software companies started when Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google presented a prototype autonomous vehicle in 2012, leading analysts and industry executives to fear a so-called Nokia moment. This occurs when a new player from the tech sector unveils a superior design, in the way that Apple Inc presented the iPhone in 2007, ending Nokia\u2019s dominance of the mobile handset business. Today, Tesla\u2019s cars are generally perceived as cutting-edge and potentially more sophisticated than VW\u2019s. Volkswagen\u2019s ID.3, which starts production this year, has an operating range of between 330 and 550 kilometers (205 to 341 miles), below the 560 km long-range Model 3 version offered by Tesla.  That is because Tesla has a sophisticated software algorithm to control how much electricity goes to the electric motor, air conditioning, seat heaters, in-car infotainment, and cooling system.  Volkswagen\u2019s edge is more blunt: price and massive economies of scale.  The ID.3 has a starting price of under 30,000 euros ($33,363) in Germany. By contrast, Tesla\u2019s Model 3 had an average selling price of $50,000 in the second quarter. The long-range version retails for 52,390 euros in Germany.  The VW vehicle\u2019s lower price comes from the carmaker\u2019s ability to place large orders which, by nature of their size, help drive down the price. Volkswagen is investing 50 billion euros ($55.5 billion) to buy battery cells and will also license its MEB electric car platform to rival carmakers to further increase economies of scale.  That is, Volkswagen will make that huge investment if suppliers can keep up.  \u201cThere is a lot of investment,\u201d Stefan Sommer, Volkswagen Group\u2019s board member responsible for procurement, told Reuters last month. \u201cBut even the big companies like Samsung, CATL, LG Chem, the big guys, SK, they hesitate to take so much money and invest because they are not seeing the market on the other side.\u201d  \u201cWe are now seeing the first battery plants, LG in Poland, CATL in Germany, they don\u2019t have the skilled workforce. That will be the bottleneck,\u201d Sommer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a learning curve everybody has to work through. This will cause some lags in supply. We have no other choice.\u201d  VW plans to license its electric MEB vehicle platform to rival Ford Motor Co, which will give VW $10 billion in revenue over the next six years.  Thomas Ulbrich, Volkswagen\u2019s member of the board who oversees production of electric vehicles, told Reuters, \u201cFord and Volkswagen\u2019s agreement will be a blueprint for further licensing deals.\u201d  In the short term, Volkswagen and its Chinese joint venture partners will invest 15 billion euros to produce 15 different electric cars for China alone by 2025.  \u201cThe first MEB-based vehicle is an SUV model,\u201d Volkswagen said about its China push.

(Reuters) - A Delaware judge ruled on Friday that Tesla Inc's TSLA.O board of directors must defend at a trial Chief Executive Elon Musk's multibillion dollar pay package, which a shareholder lawsuit said unjustly enriched the head of the electric vehicle company.  FILE PHOTO: Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk attends the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai, China August 29, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  Tesla estimated the 2018 compensation package was worth $2.6 billion when it received stockholder approval in March 2018, although stock analysts at the time said it could be worth up to $70 billion if the company - which has yet to post an annual profit - grew quickly.  The compensation award includes no salary or cash bonus for the Silicon Valley billionaire Musk, but sets rewards based on Tesla\u2019s market value rising to as much as $650 billion over the next decade.  On Friday, Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled against Tesla\u2019s request to dismiss the lawsuit by shareholder Richard Tornetta at an initial phase in the litigation because of the way the board approved the package.  As a result, the board must now defend against allegations that it breached its fiduciary duty in approving the package, and that the package unfairly enriches Tesla\u2019s CEO. The ruling opens the way for additional discovery into the decision-making process.  Tornetta had asked that the pay package be rescinded and the board of Tesla be overhauled to better protect investors.  The ruling turned on Tesla\u2019s compensation committee, which the company conceded was not independent of Musk, according to Slight\u2019s opinion. Had the package been negotiated by truly independent directors and approved by a majority of shareholders who were unaffiliated with Musk, Slights said he would have dismissed the lawsuit.  \u201cPlaintiff has well pled, however, that the board level review was not divorced from Musk\u2019s influence,\u201d Slights wrote.  Musk\u2019s compensation package passed shareholder approval with about 73 percent of votes cast, excluding votes by Musk and his brother Kimbal. The vote result indicated some, but not all, big investors were prepared to support a large payout at the founder-led company, which has struggled to produce its electric vehicles efficiently and profitably.  At the time, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services recommended voting against the compensation, noting that if achieved Musk\u2019s award would surpass anything previously granted to top U.S. executives.  Under the award, which involves stock options that vest in 12 tranches, Tesla\u2019s market value must increase to $100 billion for the first tranche to vest and rise in additional $50 billion increments for the remainder. The package does not require Tesla to hit profitability metrics.  Musk does not hold a majority of the Tesla\u2019s stock, but in a separate case, Slights determined that Musk\u2019s sway over Tesla made him in effect a controller from a legal standpoint. As a controller, the board is subject to a higher standard of legal oversight for decisions it makes regarding its relationship with Musk.  The judge did dismiss Tornetta\u2019s claim that the package amounted to a waste of corporate assets.

REUTERS\/Joe Skipper  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - So Tesla isn\u2019t going private after all. Chief Executive Elon Musk has pulled the plug on taking the $55 billion electric-car maker private, the company said late on Friday. The abysmal handling of the half-baked idea caps Musk\u2019s long record of overpromising and underdelivering.  It\u2019s now clear that his Aug. 7 tweet about taking Tesla off the public market at $420 a share with \u201cfunding secured\u201d was pie in the sky. He did not have the financing locked up, opening the door for the Securities and Exchange Commission to crawl all over the company.  The man who has spent chunks of the past few months living in the Tesla factory helping to ramp up production evidently had not considered how difficult it would be for both institutional and individual investors to keep a stake in a delisted enterprise - yet he assumed many of them would do so.  More basic considerations eluded him, too. The process, he wrote on Friday, \u201cwould be even more time-consuming and distracting than initially anticipated.\u201d It would have taken only a quick chat with a friendly Wall Street adviser to work that out.  The recent stress of his job undoubtedly plays a role. He\u2019s not sleeping well, he relies on Ambien and his emotions are running riot, a recent New York Times interview revealed. But his history of grandiose statements stretches back years; he first started making unrealistic pledges about Model 3 sedan production in 2016. He has routinely had to backtrack.  Even for a person of Musk\u2019s capabilities, he has taken on too much - and Tesla\u2019s board, packed with his family, friends and business associates, has allowed it. He is in sole charge with no obvious top lieutenant at Tesla, which has lost dozens of key employees in recent months. He is also chairman and CEO of rocket launcher SpaceX and runs the recently established Boring Co tunneling venture.  The consequences are now on display. Musk\u2019s judgment, epitomized by the buyout fiasco, looks increasingly faulty - just as Tesla needs cool heads to drive it to profitability. He and his board need a reality check. This kind of flip-flop makes his job harder to do \u2013 and should make it harder to keep.","433":"SEOUL (Reuters) - LG Chem, an electric vehicle battery supplier for Tesla, Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE and others, said on Friday it expects profitability in its battery business to rise in the second half, helping shares surge nearly 10%.  \u201cSales are expected to grow and profitability is expected to remain robust thanks to greater EV shipments for European automakers and increased sales for cylindrical EV batteries,\u201d LG Chem said.  The company did not mention Tesla, but it supplies small cylindrical-type batteries for the carmaker\u2019s China models.  LG Chem\u2019s energy solutions division, which makes batteries for smartphones and cars, swung to an operating profit in the second quarter, partly due to improved productivity at its Poland factory which caters to European customers like Volkswagen and Audi.  LG Chem said its factory utilization rates have normalized starting May after the coronavirus outbreak had led to temporary factory suspensions at automakers in the U.S. and Europe.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said the company would expand its business with Panasonic, CATL and LG Chem, adding that the real limitation to it\u2019s growth is battery cell production at an affordable price.  Musk said Tesla\u2019s Shanghai factories will produce some Model 3 sedans with the so-called lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries in volume starting later this year.  LG Chem said its batteries have an edge over the cheaper, LFP batteries from Chinese rival and Tesla supplier CATL, saying the latter\u2019s lower energy density makes it difficult to be used for longer-range, large cars.  \u201cThe LFP batteries can be used in relatively short-range cars which are sensitive to prices... We believe that our nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) batteries can be mainstream globally,\u201d said Chang Seung-se, senior vice president at LG Chem, referring to its nickel-based batteries.

Tesla\u2019s heavily-shorted shares rose as much as 6.4 percent to $364.78 in early trading, but sank after several analysts questioned whether Tesla would be able to sustain the Model 3 production momentum, which is crucial for the long-term financial health of the company.  \u201cIn the interim, we do not see this production rate as operationally or financially sustainable,\u201d said CFRA analyst Efraim Levy. \u201cHowever, over time, we expect the manufacturing rate to become sustainable and even rise.\u201d  Levy cut CFRA\u2019s rating on Tesla stock to \u201csell\u201d from \u201chold.\u201d  Tesla, which Chief Executive Elon Musk hailed on Sunday as having become a \u201creal car company,\u201d said it now expects to boost production to 6,000 Model 3s per week by late August, signaling confidence about resolving technical and assembly issues that have plagued the company for months.  Tesla also reaffirmed a positive cash flow and profit forecast for the year and announced that Doug Field, senior vice president of engineering, was stepping down after five years with the company.  Tesla has been burning through cash to produce the Model 3. Problems with an over-reliance on automation, battery issues and other bottlenecks have potentially compromised Tesla\u2019s position in the electric car market as a host of competitors prepare to launch rival vehicles.  While UBS analyst Colin Langan said there was some relief the company hit the Model 3 production target, he noted that second-quarter vehicle deliveries of 40,740 missed his expectation for 51,000 and the consensus estimate of 49,000.  He also questioned whether the company could keep up the faster production and its profit outlook.  \u201cWe\u2019re very worried about quality and if you read the reports online there\u2019s significant quality issues. They still haven\u2019t proven they can produce these profitably. The math is very challenging in getting to a sustained profit,\u201d said Langan.  Model 3 production tripled to 28,578 in the company\u2019s second quarter from the previous quarter, Tesla said.  The company said 11,166 Model 3 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the second quarter, and would be delivered early next quarter.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Reservations at the end of the second quarter stood at roughly 420,000. Tesla has delivered 28,386 Model 3 cars to date. Model 3 reservations totaled 450,000 at the end of the first quarter.  The company said it expects orders to grow faster than the production rate after it starts allowing potential customers to see and test drive Model 3s at local stores.  Despite originally touting the Model 3 as a $35,000 vehicle, Tesla has yet to begin building that basic version and instead is currently building a higher-priced model as it tries to come out of \u201cproduction hell.\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The prices of Tesla\u2019s three convertible bonds were little moved by hitting the production goal, suggesting that share price volatility discouraged bondholders from converting their securities into equity despite the positive production news.  As of Friday\u2019s close, 34.83 million Tesla shares or 27.5 percent of the shares available for trading were sold short and investors did not appear to be covering their positions ahead of Monday\u2019s announcement, according Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director at S3 Partners a financial analytics firm.  \u201cYou wonder are traders maxed out on risk on Tesla. At a certain point you\u2019re gorged. You can\u2019t take another bite,\u201d he said.  Tesla\u2019s milestone achievement did not alter a recommendation to short Tesla stock from David Kudla, founder and chief executive of Mainstay Capital Management in Grand Blanc, Michigan. Selling shares short is a bet the price will fall.  \u201cThe push to meet these self-imposed targets makes one question what cost was incurred to build these cars and how was quality adversely impacted,\u201d said Kudla, who is personally short Tesla stock.  \u201cWhether somebody is short at $361 or $300 they\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d","438":"FILE PHOTO: A logo of electric vehicle maker Tesla is seen near a shopping complex in Beijing, China, January 5, 2021.

FILE PHOTO: A Tesla logo is seen at a groundbreaking ceremony of Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory in Shanghai, China January 7, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  The two agencies are investigating several crashes involving the use of Tesla\u2019s driver assistance system Autopilot including a fatal crash in California in March 2018. NHTSA, the auto safety regulator, can demand a recall if it believes a defect poses an unreasonable risk, while the NTSB makes safety recommendations.  A spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Department that oversees NHTSA said late on Friday that \u201cNHTSA\u2019s Crash Investigation Division assigned a Special Crash Investigation team to investigate the crash\u201d, while the NTSB said it is sending a team of three \u201cto conduct a safety investigation\u201d.  A report on Friday\u2019s crash released by the Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Department did not indicate if Autopilot was engaged at the time of the crash that killed the 50-year-old Tesla Model 3 owner.  The report said the Tesla struck a tractor trailer and the roof was sheared off as it passed underneath the trailer and came to a rest three-tenths of a mile south of the collision. The driver was pronounced dead at the scene.  Tesla declined to comment on Friday.  Some Tesla drivers say they are able to avoid putting their hands on the wheel for extended periods when using Autopilot, while Tesla advises drivers that they must keep their hands on the steering wheel and pay attention at all times while using Autopilot.  NHTSA is also probing the January 2018 crash of a Tesla vehicle apparently traveling in Autopilot that struck a fire truck in Culver City, California, a May 2018 crash in Utah of a Tesla in Autopilot mode and a May 2018 Tesla accident in Florida that killed two teenagers and injured another but was not in Autopilot mode.  The NTSB is investigating three earlier Tesla incidents being reviewed by NHTSA, as well as an August 2017 Tesla battery fire in California, in which an owner ran the vehicle into his garage.  Friday\u2019s crash is similar to the first fatal Tesla crash linked to Autopilot use.  In May 2016, a Tesla Model S driver was killed near Williston, Florida, using Autopilot when he slammed into a tractor trailer that also sheared off the vehicle roof.  The incident raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.  The NTSB said in September 2017 Tesla lacked proper safeguards that allowed the driver \u201cto use the system outside of the environment for which it was designed and the system gave far too much leeway to the driver to divert his attention.\u201d  In January 2017, NHTSA said its review found no evidence of defects in the 2016 fatal Autopilot crash that would require a recall.","440":"BOSTON (Reuters) - With a volatile chief executive and a potential breakthrough product starting production, Tesla Inc TSLA.O is a challenging stock to hold.

The Center for Auto Safety and Consumer Watchdog, both non-profit groups, sent a letter to the FTC saying that consumers could be misled into thinking, based on Tesla\u2019s marketing and advertising, that Autopilot makes a Tesla vehicle self-driving.  Autopilot, released in 2015, is an enhanced cruise-control system that partially automates steering and braking. Tesla states in its owner\u2019s manual and in disclaimers that when the system is engaged, a driver must keep hands on the wheel at all times while using Autopilot.  But in the letter, the groups said that a series of ads and press releases from Tesla as well as statements by the company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, \u201cmislead and deceive customers into believing that Autopilot is safer and more capable than it is known to be.\u201d  \u201cTesla is the only automaker to market its Level 2 vehicles as \u2018self-driving\u2019, and the name of its driver assistance suite of features, Autopilot, connotes full autonomy,\u201d the letter read.  \u201cThe burden now falls on the FTC to investigate Tesla\u2019s unfair and deceptive practices so that consumers have accurate information, understand the limitations of Autopilot, and conduct themselves appropriately and safely,\u201d it read.  Two U.S. Tesla drivers have died in crashes in which Autopilot was engaged. The most recent crash, in March, is being investigated by safety regulators.  Tesla has said the use of Autopilot results in 40 percent fewer crashes, a claim the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration repeated in a 2017 report on the first fatality, which occurred in May 2016.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk told shareholders on Tuesday Tesla has secured rights to 10,000 acres in Nevada where it aims to produce lithium from clay deposits using a process developed internally.  The move would make Tesla the first company in the world to commercially produce the white metal from clay. Lithium is produced either from brine, commonly found in South America, or spodumene hard rock, usually in Australia.  In Nevada, Tesla plans to mix clay with table salt and then add water, which it says causes a reaction where the salt would leach out with lithium, which can then be extracted. The leftover clay would be put back in the earth to mitigate environmental damage.  \u201cIt\u2019s a very sustainable way of obtaining lithium,\u201d said Musk, who did not say where in Nevada the company had obtained the lithium rights or whether development has started.  The plan drew backlash almost immediately, with critics describing Musk\u2019s plan as too simplistic and light on details. Returning rock to the earth after minerals are extracted, for instance, is already common industry practice through the use of tailings dams.  \u201cThis plan from Tesla brings up a lot more questions than it answers,\u201d said Chris Berry, an independent lithium industry consultant. \u201cAre we just supposed to take Elon Musk\u2019s word for it that the cost will be lower than existing lithium projects?\u201d  Palo Alto, Calif.-based Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Nevada already has several lithium clay projects under development, including one from Lithium Americas Corp LAC.TO that has been seeking federal permit approval for more than a decade and another from ioneer Ltd INR.AX.  Lithium Americas has said it is confident it can successfully extract lithium from clay through a process that involves acid leaching. Tesla said its process won\u2019t involve acid, fueling further questions.  \u201cIf producing lithium in commercial amounts at battery quality grades from clay was feasible, why isn\u2019t it already being done?\u201d said Berry.  Any lithium project from Tesla would require an intensive application process for necessary permits that could stretch on for years.  \"Mining lithium is very challenging,\" said Pedro Palandrani of the Global X Lithium & Battery Technology ETF LIT.P, which holds shares in Tesla and lithium producers. \"If Tesla really wants to fly solo, we're talking about four to five years to really see any kind of lithium production.\"  Tesla\u2019s plan also would likely require substantial amounts of water, forcing the company to battle with cattle ranchers for access to underground reservoirs in the arid state.  Albemarle Corp ALB.N operated the only existing U.S. lithium mine at a site roughly 200 miles (322 km) north of Las Vegas until it shut it down last month.  Operational since the late 1960s, the site produced less than 5,000 tonnes of lithium per year, a relatively small amount and far less than Tesla would need.","466":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chief Executive Elon Musk barked at engineers on the Fremont, California assembly line. Tesla Inc tapped workers from other departments to keep pumping out the Model 3 electric sedans, disrupting production of the Model S and X lines. And weekend shifts were mandatory.  Tesla pulled out all the stops in the final week of June to meet its goal of making 5,000 Model 3s in a week, according to employees who spoke to Reuters. The sedan is essential to put money-losing Tesla on a path to profitability and prove that the electric car company can master mass production.  Whether Tesla can do it week in and week out - and without relying on overtime and extra hands - is another question, and one that weighed on investors.  Shares closed down 7.2 percent at $310.86 on Tuesday.  Leading up to Sunday morning\u2019s production milestone, Musk paced the Model 3 line, snapping at his engineers when the around-the-clock production slowed or stopped due to problems with robots, one worker said.  Tesla built a new line in just two weeks in a huge tent outside the main factory, an unprecedented move in an industry that takes years to plan out its assembly lines, and said the tented production area accounted for 20 percent of the Model 3s produced last week.  \u201cThey were borrowing people from our line all day to cover their (Model 3) breaks so the line would continue to move,\u201d said a Model S worker on Sunday.  \u201cThey\u2019ve been throwing Model 3s ahead of the S to get painted to try to assure that they make their goal of 5,000,\u201d the worker said. \u201cThe paint department can\u2019t handle the volume.\u201d  Because of the focus on the Model 3, the S line was about 800 cars behind schedule to enter the paint shop, the worker said.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Any potential disruption of the Model S and X lines could threaten Tesla\u2019s target of building 100,000 of those vehicles in 2018. Tesla built 49,489 of those cars in the first half of this year.  Tesla said there had been no disruption to S and X productivity and noted it also built 1,913 of those vehicles during the last week of the quarter along with its Model 3s. A spokesperson also said workers from the S and X line had volunteered to help out on the 3 line.  Tesla built a total of 28,578 Model 3s in the second quarter, and 40,989 since production began last July, the company said.  Last week\u2019s big push also brought a rewrite of the employee attendance policy. After mandatory weekend shifts were assigned, two workers said, Tesla rescinded a policy promising workers at least one week\u2019s notice before weekend work.  \u201cThe manager and supervisor are verbally going around and saying: \u2018If you don\u2019t come in, you\u2019ll be written up\u2019,\u201d one of the workers told Reuters last week.  Some employees are worried the frenetic pace plus long hours could burn out workers. One employee said they were told to keep working until they met their daily production mark, not when their shifts ended.  \u201cThey said starting tomorrow be prepared to work up to 12 hours,\u201d said the Model S employee on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be basically 12 hours from now on and I\u2019ve got a feeling it\u2019s going to be six days a week.\u201d  To make its number, Tesla was willing to \u201cspend any kind of money,\u201d a Gigafactory worker said, pointing to the new battery assembly-line flown in from Europe via cargo planes to the Gigafactory in May.

Musk\u2019s compensation is exclusively made up of a series of potential stock options rewards based on market capitalization and operational goals. To secure Musk\u2019s fourth tranche, Tesla still must hit a goal related to revenue or profitability, and that could happen in the company\u2019s third-quarter report, the date of which has yet to be announced.  (Graphic: Elon Musk's expanding payout - )  Tesla\u2019s stock was down 0.8% at mid-day on Tuesday, but the company\u2019s six-month average market capitalization rose, thanks to a strong rally in recent months.  Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 8.44 million Tesla shares at $70 each, about a sixth of their current price.  At Tesla\u2019s current stock price of $420, Musk would theoretically be able to sell the shares related to the upcoming tranche, plus three other tranches that vested in recent months, for a combined profit of $11.8 billion, or almost $3 billion per tranche.  Musk\u2019s first tranche was worth about $700 million in May, when it vested, but its value has increased along with Tesla\u2019s stock price.  The Silicon Valley billionaire\u2019s pay package, which surpasses anything previously granted to top U.S. executives, was controversial when it was approved by shareholders. The median compensation for Tesla employees last year was about $58,000, according to a company filing.  Tesla\u2019s stock has surged 400% in 2020 as the company increased sales of its Model 3 sedan, giving it stock market value of almost $400 billion. After Tesla last week said it delivered a record 139,300 vehicles in the third quarter, investors are now awaiting the company\u2019s quarterly financial report.  While investors focus on gross margins, free cash flow and earnings per share in that report, adjusted EBITDA will be key to Musk\u2019s personal finances. EBITDA, which stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is a non-GAAP operating metric that Tesla further customizes by excluding the cost of stock-based compensation, including Musk\u2019s.  In the four quarters through June, Tesla\u2019s adjusted EBITDA reached $4.42 billion, just short of a $4.5 billion milestone that would open the way for Musk\u2019s next options tranche.  JPMorgan estimated in a recent client note that Tesla will report adjusted EBITDA of $1.183 billion for the September quarter, which would raise Tesla\u2019s rolling four quarters of adjusted EBITDA to $4.52 billion. That, along with Tuesday\u2019s increase in the company\u2019s six-month average market capitalization, would qualify Musk for his next options payout.","471":"(Corrects to say share offering was priced at $243, not $244.10, in headline and first paragraph)  May 3 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Friday its offering of 3.1 million shares was priced at $243 per share and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk will buy shares worth up to $25 million.

Cao, Xiaopeng and Zoox could not be immediately reached for comment.  Tesla is building a vehicle assembly facility in Shanghai, putting it in direct competition with Xiaopeng and other Chinese companies in the world\u2019s largest electric vehicle market.  Its Autopilot is a driver assistance system that handles some driving tasks and allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel, although the company stresses it still requires driver supervision and does not make the vehicle autonomous.

Xiaopeng, which debuted an electric car in Las Vegas last year, counts Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Foxconn Technology Co Ltd among its investors.  The company, also known as Xpeng Motors, employs at least five former Tesla employees, the U.S. carmaker alleged in the lawsuit.  Apple Inc last year accused here one former employee of stealing trade secrets related to self-driving cars and joining Xiaopeng's U.S. subsidiary.  Several companies are racing to develop the technology required to make cars drive on their own and lawsuits against former employees have become common as firms strive to keep proprietary information in-house.  Alphabet Inc's Waymo self-driving vehicle unit took here Uber Technologies to court after a former employee stole thousands of confidential documents and became chief of Uber's self-driving car project. Uber later paid $245 million to settle the case.

The settlement would also require Tesla to appoint two new independent directors, the report said.  Musk reportedly refused to sign the deal as he felt by settling he would not be truthful to himself and he wouldn\u2019t have been able to live with the idea that he agreed to accept a settlement and any blemish associated with that, the report said.  Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  \u201cI\u2019m not sure if they can settle with the SEC after turning down the opportunity, but you never know,\u201d Ivan Fienseth, an analyst with Tigress Financial Partners said.  The SEC on Thursday filed a lawsuit against Musk accusing him of fraud and sought to remove him from his role saying he made a series of \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d tweets about potentially taking the company private.  Shares of Tesla dived 11 percent on Friday as Wall Street worried the lawsuit could force Musk to step down and make it difficult for the loss-making carmaker to raise more capital.  Several worried that the SEC action was also just the beginning of a legal battle with authorities, short sellers and other investors over Musk\u2019s actions that could cost Tesla heavily.  \u201cThe SEC civil action may lead to Musk\u2019s exit from Tesla (either permanently or temporarily) and the Musk premium in the shares dissipating,\u201d Barclays analyst Brian Johnson said.  Musk, 47, is the public face of Tesla, and has driven it to the verge of profitability with a costly ramp-up of production of its Model 3 sedan over the past year.

The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) awarded a 250 megawatt (MW) grid services contract to Neoen's 300 MW Victorian Big Battery, which will use Tesla Inc's TSLA.O Megapack technology.  Neoen said the battery would be operating by the end of 2021 and would help the state reach its goal of 50% renewable power by 2030. It declined to say how much it would cost to build.  The state will pay A$84 million over the 11 years to 2032 for the \u201chumongous battery\u201d to boost power flow between Victoria and New South Wales during summer months, Victoria\u2019s energy minister Lily D\u2019Ambrosio told an online media briefing.  \u201cBy securing one of the biggest batteries in the world, Victoria is taking a decisive step away from coal-fired power and embracing new technologies that will unlock more renewable energy than ever before,\u201d she said.  AEMO held a tender on behalf of the state for services to prevent blackouts as Victoria increasingly relies on variable wind and solar power.  If there is a sudden drop in power supply, the battery will be called on to discharge energy of up to 250 MW within seconds, giving the market operator time to dispatch other generation and storage to keep the system stable, AEMO said.  The Victorian Big Battery is double the size of Neoen\u2019s recently expanded Hornsdale Power Reserve, Australia\u2019s first energy storage site, built in 2017, following a string of blackouts.  The Australian Energy Council, which represents the country\u2019s main power producers, opposed the state\u2019s intervention in the market, as it would affect returns that other generators would get during summer peak periods.","476":"FILE PHOTO: A 2018 Tesla Model 3 electric vehicle is shown in this photo illustration taken in Cardiff, California, U.S., June 1, 2018.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk last week blamed a wait for government approval in Norway, its biggest market after the United States and China, for not being able to move faster in addressing growing complaints from consumers.  The Norwegian Consumer Council said on July 4 Tesla had climbed to fourth place in the first six months of 2018 in the list of companies Norwegians complain about the most, up from 24th in 2017.  Musk tweeted in response: \u201cNorwegians are right to be upset with Tesla. We are having trouble expanding our service facilities in Oslo especially.

FILE PHOTO: A Tesla logo on a Model S is photographed inside of a Tesla dealership in New York, U.S., April 29, 2016. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  Wall Street analysts and investors have raised doubts about demand and the Silicon Valley automaker\u2019s ability to sort out recent delivery issues, particularly after a disastrous first quarter when deliveries slumped 31%.  \u201cWe are increasingly comfortable that they should reflect an even better in the third quarter, and probably their first hundred thousand in a quarter,\u201d Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said.  Tesla delivered 95,200 vehicles in the second quarter, beating analysts\u2019 average estimates, but did not comment on when it would return to profitability.  Shares of the company were up 6.4% at $238.92, their highest in nearly two months. Up to Tuesday close, the stock had lost nearly one-third of its value so far this year.  Tesla\u2019s first quarter was hurt by logistics issues at international ports and a drop-off in U.S. orders after a tax credit was halved, which spurred concerns that demand for Tesla\u2019s electric cars may have peaked.  While Musk has been trying to convince investors that demand remains high for Tesla cars and delivery could be made efficiently, some analysts remained skeptical about Tesla\u2019s ability to deliver on its promise and maintain margins.  Needham analysts said they remain cautious about Tesla\u2019s ability to remain profitable and maintain healthy margins, with Credit Suisse analysts also echoing a similar view.  In the quarter, Tesla delivered 77,550 Model 3s - seen as linchpin for its growth into a mass-market company. That compared with analysts\u2019 average estimate of 73,144, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Tesla \u201chas a shot at being profitable this quarter on a non-GAAP (adjusted) basis, even with materially pressured automotive gross margins\u201d.  Tesla still faces multiple challenges, including starting production in China in the backdrop of U.S.-China trade tensions and overhauling its production process at a time when several of its top executives are leaving the company.  \u201cThese are undeniably strong numbers, but given Tesla\u2019s recent history of significant swings in performance from quarter-to-quarter we remain cautious for now,\u201d Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Nicholas Hyett said.","478":"FILE PHOTO: The view of Tesla Inc's U.S. vehicle factory which was open for business on March 18, despite an order by the Alameda county's sheriff's office to comply with a three-week lockdown in the San Francisco Bay Area, in order to rein in the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID), in Fremont, California, U.S., March 18, 2020.

Still, a Reuters analysis of Tesla's and other luxury carmakers' operating profit per vehicle - a metric closely watched by auto executives - shows Tesla still has a long way to go before reaching the steady profits of rivals Porsche PSHG_p.DE, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.  (For a graphic comparing vehicles' profitability, click )  At an average of roughly $17,750 per vehicle, operating profit at luxury carmaker Porsche, for example, has been stable over the past four years. Mercedes\u2019 and BMW\u2019s profit per vehicle have been closer to $3,000.  At Tesla, on the other hand, operating results fluctuated between a loss of nearly $20,500 per vehicle in the third quarter of 2017 and a profit of nearly $5,000 per vehicle in the third quarter of 2018.  Calculating profits per vehicle allows for better comparison across the auto industry. Reuters selected Porsche, BMW and Mercedes because their cars compete in similar price segments and for a like-minded customer base.  Tesla\u2019s rally in recent months has been fueled by its unexpected third-quarter profit, a production ramp-up at its new factory in China and better-than-expected car deliveries. Tesla\u2019s stock was up 1% on Tuesday.  While analysts on average expect Tesla to report another profitable quarter, it would be only the fifth such quarter since 2010. For the December quarter, analysts on average expect Tesla to post revenue down 2.9% to $7.02 billion and adjusted net income of $305 million, or $1.72 per share.  Options traders expect more volatility after Tesla releases its fourth-quarter results late on Wednesday.  As of Tuesday, Tesla options implied an 11% swing for the shares in either direction by Friday. Over the last eight quarters, the stock moved 9.5% on average after Tesla reported results, according to options analytics company Trade Alert.  Porsche last year released its first fully-electric sports car, while Mercedes and BMW have released their own electric vehicle versions. General Motors and Ford Motor are gearing up to launch their own electric vehicles.  While the German carmakers still largely rely on combustion engine-powered cars and are struggling to persuade customers to pay a premium for electric vehicles, they have a century of manufacturing and a well-developed global sales network behind them.  As Musk\u2019s nears the first tranche of a record pay package that depends in part on increasing Tesla\u2019s market capitalization, the carmaker\u2019s stock remains among the most divisive on Wall Street.  While Tesla\u2019s recent progress has cheered supporters, many investors remain skeptical of the company\u2019s ability to consistently deliver profit and cash flow. As well as repeatedly missing targets in recent years, Musk\u2019s mercurial behavior has come under scrutiny from financial regulators and shareholders.  Tesla\u2019s market capitalization must be sustained at or above $100 billion for both a one-month and six-month average in order to trigger the vesting of a $346-million tranche of options that are the first part of Musk\u2019s record-breaking pay package.  (Graphic: Elon Musk's big payout, )  In the past 30 days, short bets against Tesla have decreased by almost $660 million to $14 billion, eclipsing the $12.9 billion worth of short positions against much-larger Apple and making Tesla the most shorted stock on Wall Street, according to S3 Partners, a financial technology and analytics firm.

FILE PHOTO: A Tesla Model S electric car is seen at its dealership in Seoul, South Korea July 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Kim Hong-Ji  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) made the unusual recall request in a formal Jan. 13 letter to Tesla, saying it had tentatively concluded the 2012-2018 Model S and 2016-2018 Model X vehicles pose a safety issue. Automakers usually agree to voluntary fixes before the auto safety agency formally seeks a recall.  The agency said touchscreen failures posed significant safety issues, including the loss of rearview or backup camera images, exterior turn-signal lighting, and windshield defogging and defrosting systems that \u201cmay decrease the driver\u2019s visibility in inclement weather.\u201d  NHTSA had required Tesla to respond to its recall demand by Jan. 27. Tesla agreed that same day to the recall, the company said.  Tesla said in its filing with NHTSA that \u201cin the interest of bringing administrative closure to the investigation and to ensure the best ownership experience for our customers\u201d it agreed to a voluntary recall.  NHTSA opened a probe in June 2020 into complaints that media control unit (MCU) failures led to touchscreen displays not working.  The agency said other automakers issued numerous recalls for similar safety issues stemming from the touchscreen failure.  NHTSA said in November when it upgraded its probe that it reviewed 12,523 claims and complaints about the issue.  NHTSA said last month that \u201cduring our review of the data, Tesla provided confirmation that all units will inevitably fail given the memory device\u2019s finite storage capacity.\u201d  Many complaints had said Tesla required owners to pay to replace the unit once warranties expire. Tesla will replace the defective part and reimburse customers who paid to replace a part that failed because of lifetime wear.  Tesla acknowledged the problem but said if the display was not working, \u201cthe driver can perform a shoulder check and use the mirrors. If the screen is not visible to control the climate control and defroster settings, the driver will be able to manually clear the windshield.\u201d  The recall will begin March 30. NHTSA sought a recall of 158,000 vehicles but Tesla said the recall does not include some vehicles with upgraded processors built after March 2018.  Tesla said 88% of U.S. owners have gotten over-the-air updates to some functionalities that may be lost if displays fail.","482":"(Adds Altmaier, reaction to Tesla plans)  BERLIN, Nov 24 (Reuters) - European countries are intensifying cooperation on battery cell production for electric cars, and will extend this cross-border approach into new industrial areas such as hydrogen technology, the German economy minister said on Tuesday.  \u201cWe want to support the creation of a complete value chain for battery cells in Europe, from the processing of raw materials to battery cell production to recycling,\u201d Peter Altmaier told an economic conference in Berlin.  The German government is supporting local production of battery cells with 3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) to reduce dependence on suppliers from Asia.  The EU has green-lit such state support as part of its Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) scheme.  Altmaier said he was confident that European manufacturers would have a 30% market share by 2030 by manufacturing the most innovative and environmentally friendly battery cells.  Increased cooperation on battery cells should become a blueprint for other European industrial projects such as hydrogen technologies, Altmaier added.  European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said Brussels was looking into suitable hydrogen projects and details were likely next year.  The German government has passed a 9-billion-euro hydrogen investment plan as part of a stimulus package to help its economy recover from the coronavirus shock and accelerate a shift towards green technology.  Altmaier also welcomed an announcement by Tesla CEO Elon Musk during the conference that his company plans to turn its new e-cars factory near Berlin into one of the world\u2019s largest battery production plants.  It will be the fourth Tesla Gigafactory - producing cars and batteries - and the first in Europe. The company plans to have the factory up and running by July 1, 2021 to start building its electric crossover, the Model Y.  Among companies benefiting from IPCEI state support are German battery maker Varta, BMW, chemical group BASF as well as Peugeot and its German Opel subsidiary.  The economy ministry expects the battery cell initiative to create more than 20,000 new jobs over the next 10 years. This is likely to offset losses caused by weaker demand for combustion engines.

FILE PHOTO: Markus Duesmann, board member of German luxury carmaker BMW attends the company's annual news conference in Munich, Germany, March 21, 2018. REUTERS\/Michael Dalder\/File Photo  New Audi boss Markus Duesmann is assembling a team of about 200 engineers within parent company Volkswagen Group VOWG_p.DE to develop a new computer-driven vehicle system, he told Reuters.  Dubbed \u201cProject Artemis\u201d after the Ancient Greek goddess of hunting, the plan is to chase down - and overtake - Tesla, widely viewed as the industry leader in software.  \u201cWhen it comes to digitalisation we are lagging behind - for now,\u201d Duesmann said in an interview at Audi\u2019s headquarters in Ingolstadt, southern Germany.  With the advent of self-driving cars, vehicles need processors and software operating systems to analyse data from radar, lidar, and camera sensors to calculate driving reflexes so cars can navigate and avoid accidents on their own.  In the past, bigger cars with more powerful engines were automatically better. Now computing power and intelligence will be a key metric for defining what is premium, forcing Audi and Volkswagen to retool the way they design cars.  \u201cTechnical development of vehicles is no longer organised according to a vehicle\u2019s size, but by the car\u2019s electrical and electronic architecture,\u201d Duesmann said, explaining that premium and value models would now differentiate themselves according to their computing power and sensor levels.  To build the new system, Duesmann is assembling a \u201cresults oriented\u201d engineering team to work on accelerating development of a scalable vehicle platform.  \u201c(Project) Artemis will be smaller than a Formula One team. I am thinking around 200 staff,\u201d he said.  \u201cTo develop a new car with so many new features in this period until 2024 is so demanding that it is probably without precedent. That\u2019s why we have decided to work with a separate unit,\u201d said Duesmann, who is also head of research at Volkswagen Group.  The idea is that an agile development group will be less encumbered by the bureaucracy within Volkswagen Group, which owns brands including Bugatti, Bentley, Porsche, Skoda, and Lamborghini, as well as Audi and VW.  VW has more than 10,000 employees working in research and development at the company\u2019s Wolfsburg headquarters alone.  Artemis will be led by Alexander Hitzinger, who was responsible for autonomous driving at Volkswagen and built up the Porsche racing team that won Le Mans endurance race in 2015, 2016, 2017. Hitzinger also worked at Apple, where he set up and managed product development for autonomous vehicles.  The Artemis team will harness the engineering know-how within Volkswagen Group, but also have the authority to use outside partners.  \u201cIf we gain speed with a supplier or with a software company, we will consider it. Speed is extremely important,\u201d Duesmann said. China will also play a role, Duesmann added, declining to elaborate.  Project Artemis will sit alongside Volkswagen Group\u2019s Car.Software organisation, also based in Ingolstadt.  \u201cThey need each other,\u201d Duesmann said, adding many of Artemis\u2019s staff would remain embedded within Volkswagen Group brands, but receive instructions from Ingolstadt.  \u201cThe result will be a common concept which is scalable for all of us,\u201d Duesmann said. \u201cThe first model will be an Audi.\u201d","484":"BENGALURU (Reuters) - Billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla Inc will set up an electric-car manufacturing unit in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, according to a government document seen by Reuters on Saturday.

Tesla and the office of Karnataka state chief minister did not immediately respond to Reuters\u2019 request for comments.  Musk has tweeted several times about the company\u2019s impending foray into India. In December, the Tesla CEO confirmed in an exchange on Twitter that Tesla will launch in the country in 2021.  India has been keen to reduce its oil dependence and cut down on pollution, but its efforts to promote electric vehicles have been stymied by a lack of investment in manufacturing and infrastructure such as charging stations.  To boost investment, India plans to offer $4.6 billion in incentives to companies setting up advanced battery manufacturing facilities, Reuters reported last year.","485":"Slideshow ( 4 images )  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that U.S. automakers Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co and Tesla Inc had been given the green light to produce ventilators and other items needed during the coronavirus outbreak.  \u201cFord, General Motors and Tesla are being given the go ahead to make ventilators and other metal products, FAST! @fema Go for it auto execs, lets see how good you are?\u201d he said on Twitter.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked a federal court in Manhattan to hold Musk in contempt after he tweeted about Tesla\u2019s production volume, saying he breached the agreement requiring him to get company approval before sharing any material information on social media.  The renewed public battle between Tesla\u2019s CEO and the SEC adds pressure on Musk, the public face of the electric vehicle-maker who is struggling to make it profitable after cutting the price of its Model 3 sedan to $35,000.  Musk on Feb. 19 tweeted to his more than 24 million Twitter followers that Tesla would make around 500,000 cars in 2019.  He corrected the tweet four hours later to say the annualized production rate at year-end 2019 would probably be about 500,000, with deliveries of about 400,000.  A lawyer for Tesla and Musk told the SEC that the CEO believed the substance of the tweet had been pre-approved and disseminated when the company released fourth-quarter earnings in January.  The September settlement between Musk, Tesla and the SEC resolved an SEC lawsuit over claims Musk made on Twitter in August that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The SEC called those tweets \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d and a go-private deal never materialized.  As part of that settlement, Musk stepped down as the company\u2019s chairman and he and Tesla agreed to pay $20 million each in fines.  Musk had called the regulator the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission\u201d after the settlement, and tweeted that \u201csomething is broken with SEC oversight\u201d just one day after the SEC started pursuing the contempt order. Hours later, U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan set a March 11 deadline for Musk to respond.  Legal experts have said the SEC could now pursue multiple avenues, including a higher fine, imposing further restrictions on Musk\u2019s activities or removing him from Tesla\u2019s board or helm.  Tesla published a new communications policy in December for executives as part of the settlement. It called for Tesla\u2019s general counsel and a newly designated in-house securities law attorney to pre-approve any written statements about Tesla that could be material.  A disclosure controls committee, made up of board members Brad Buss, Antonio Gracias and James Murdoch, was tasked with overseeing compliance with the new policy.

FILE PHOTO: Nico Hulkenberg of Germany celebrates with mechanics after winning with his Porsche 919 Hybrid number 19 the Le Mans 24-hour sportscar race in Le Mans, central France, June 14, 2015.  While Volkswagen, the world\u2019s largest automaker, has been rolling out electric vehicles from the ID.3 compact to the high end Porsche Taycan, analysts say it needs a more comprehensive system that integrates electric power with new self-driving and infotainment technologies if it hopes to overtake Tesla.  It has turned to Hitzinger, whose ability to conceptualise clean-sheet designs and manage projects helped Porsche develop a racecar that won the Le Mans endurance race in 2015, 2016, 2017.  After a stint working on Apple\u2019s autonomous cars, Hitzinger now heads up Volkswagen\u2019s \u201cProject Artemis\u201d, named after the Ancient Greek goddess of hunting, with the aim of chasing down electric car pioneer Tesla.  \u201cAt Porsche, I always thought of a vehicle as a comprehensive system. This is a very important point. It is what Tesla does well,\u201d he explained in a video interview.  The task of building a car has gotten more complex with the advent of electric and autonomous driving technologies, forcing new battery-driven powertrains to compete for electricity with camera, radar, and lidar sensors, plus infotainment systems.  Rather than stitching together separately designed systems, Artemis wants to create something new and seamlessly integrated, from the ground up, Hitzinger told Reuters.  \u201cThe idea behind Artemis is to have a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle. When something is optimised, this has knock-on effects and these need to be understood.\u201d  Allocating processing power between propulsion, automated driving and infotainment systems such as satellite navigation and music streaming is a key challenge, he said.  But it\u2019s not the only one.  \u201cThe human-machine interface, the interior design, the exterior design, aerodynamics and the range are all interconnected. If I modify something on the exterior, it will impact the aerodynamics and the efficiency,\u201d Hitzinger said.  Volkswagen Group, whose brands range from budget Seats and Skodas to high-end Audis and Bentleys is now focussing on developing systems that can handle all these new demands.  The car, which is due to be produced in 2024, will make use of components developed for Porsche and Audi\u2019s premium electric vehicle platform, PPE. The group\u2019s factory in Hanover, Germany, is being retooled to build an electric sport-utility vehicle for Audi, Bentley and Porsche.  Having a small team of highly qualified engineers, who are empowered to take decisions unencumbered by the corporate bureaucracy of the Volkswagen empire, should end up producing a better vehicle more quickly.  Project Artemis will have between 200 and 250 staff once Hitzinger is done hiring, up from 10 at present.  \u201cI am putting the team together on a top down basis. The managers come first. Then I look for A-players, who will attract other A-players. I don\u2019t want managers, but people who love to develop technologies, who are prepared to take risks,\u201d he said.  Artemis will seek to draw on existing skills within the Volkswagen Group, such as expertise in making vehicle bodies at Audi, but take the lead in developing new techniques which speed up production and improve the customer experience.  \u201cWe want to set new standards for what a customer can do in a vehicle and how he interacts with the car,\u201d Hitzinger said.  He declined to elaborate on what user experiences the new car would offer, citing the confidential nature of the project.  He also declined to comment on a power struggle unfolding at Volkswagen, which has convened its executive committee to meet on Tuesday to decide whether to extend CEO Herbert Diess\u2019s contract.","489":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O will eliminate some color options for its electric cars to streamline production, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted on Tuesday, as the company intensifies its efforts to ramp up production.

FILE PHOTO: A Volkswagen E-Golf electric vehicle is displayed at the Canadian International Auto Show in Toronto, Ontario, Canada February 18, 2020. REUTERS\/Chris Helgren\/File Photo  Berlin\u2019s 130 billion euros ($147.41 billion) coronavirus stimulus plan follows French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s pledge to make France the top producer of clean vehicles in Europe.  Germany doubled electric car subsidies, lowered value added tax (VAT) to 16% from 19%, and rejected an auto industry request to incentivise vehicles with internal combustion engines in favour of a plan to increase charging infrastructure.  German fuel stations will be required to provide electric vehicle charging, transforming opportunities to refuel zero-emission cars that consumers have shunned in part because of concerns over their range.  Electric cars, which made up only 1.8% of new passenger car registrations in Germany last year, will be boosted by a 6,000 euro incentive for electric cars that cost below 40,000 euros.  This brings consumer incentives for electric cars in Germany to 9,000 euros once a 3,000 euro manufacturer stipend is included.  According to Germany\u2019s Federal Office for Economy and Export, BAFA, the cars eligible for the full subsidy include the BMW i3, Hyundai\u2019s Ioniq and Kona models, Kia\u2019s E-Nero, Peugeot\u2019s electric 208, Renault\u2019s Zoe and Tesla\u2019s Model 3.  Tesla and VW, which is readying a mass market push for its ID3 model, will be well-placed to flood the market with the help of the stimulus measures, analysts said. Tesla\u2019s Model S and the Mercedes EQC are eligible for subsidies, but not for the full amount.  German new car sales fell 49.5% in May following a 61.1% slump in April, leaving thousands of petrol and diesel engine cars unsold and analysts questioning whether demand will recover from a coronavirus-induced slump.  \u201cThe lowering of VAT will hardly provide an impetus,\u201d said Peter Fuss, a partner at EY, adding electric cars were still too niche to lift the overall market.  Germany will overhaul its motor vehicle tax. From January 2021, cars with emissions higher than 95 grams of CO2 per kilometre will face increased levies. This benefits hybrid vehicles in the short term, but a staggered CO2 tax treats them as only an interim way to cut pollution.  The average emissions of a new car last year in Germany was around 150.9 grams of CO2 per kilometre. The popularity of SUVs increased average emissions of new cars to 154.8 grams per kilometre in May.  Berlin\u2019s plans are a rebuff to the German auto industry\u2019s lobbying efforts and are more radical than the French programme, which includes a scrappage scheme that boosts sales of petrol and diesel vehicles.  \u201cThe VDA regrets that the stimulus plan only partially included the auto industry\u2019s proposals for a broad and immediate economic impulse,\u201d German auto industry association VDA said on Thursday.  Environment campaigners welcomed the investment in electric transport that chimes with European Union ambitions to cut net emissions to zero by 2050.  \u201cThis is exactly what\u2019s needed to support jobs and help us emerge stronger and greener from the COVID crisis,\u201d Stef Cornelis, Germany director for campaign group Transport & Environment, said.","492":"WASHINGTON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc\u2019s handling of Chief Executive Elon Musk\u2019s proposal to take the carmaker private and its failure to promptly file a formal disclosure has raised governance concerns and sparked questions about how companies use social media.  Musk stunned investors last Tuesday by announcing on Twitter that he was considering taking Tesla private in a potential $72 billion transaction and that \u201cfunding\u201d had been \u201csecured.\u201d  Tesla\u2019s shares closed up 11 percent before retrenching after the Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had asked Tesla why Musk announced his plans on Twitter and whether his statement was truthful.  Musk provided no details of his funding and as of Thursday Tesla\u2019s board had not received a financing plan from Musk, Reuters reported, leaving investors and the broader market clamoring for more information.  Putting aside whether Musk misled anyone, the unorthodox manner in which he announced the news and Tesla\u2019s failure to promptly clarify the situation with a regulatory filing is a corporate governance lapse that raises questions about how companies use social media to release market-moving news, securities lawyers said.  \u201cManagement buyouts or other take-private transactions already suffer from serious information asymmetry between management and public shareholders,\u201d said Gabriel Rauterberg, a University of Michigan law professor.  SEC rules typically require companies to file an 8-K form within four business days of a significant corporate event.  While several securities lawyers said Musk\u2019s tweets alone did not trigger this obligation, such a filing would be prudent given the unusual circumstances, David Axelrod, a partner at law firm Ballard Spahr LLP, said.  \u201cAn 8-K would provide some more details, it would say what stage negotiations are in, and provide more information than 53 characters in a tweet,\u201d he added.  SEC guidelines published in 2013 allow companies and their executives to use social media to distribute material information, provided investors have been alerted that this is a possibility. Tesla did this in a 2013 filing.  But such disclosures have to be full and fair, meaning the information is complete and accessible by all investors at the same time, a bar that Musk\u2019s tweets may not have met.  \u201cTwitter is not designed to provide full and fair disclosure. That doesn\u2019t mean that you couldn\u2019t, but in a series of 20 to 30 characters I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re getting full disclosure,\u201d said Zachary Fallon, a former SEC attorney and principal at law firm Blakemore Fallon.  Tesla and the SEC did not reply to requests for comment on Sunday.  Securities lawyers said there was also a question mark over whether Musk selectively disclosed information on the possible terms of the deal when he subsequently replied to followers, two of whom claim in their handles to be investors.  Those tweets were not immediately visible to all followers of Musk\u2019s main feed until he retweeted them.  The 47-year-old billionaire\u2019 s history of joking about Tesla and using twitter to bait his critics, also appears to have undermined trust in Musk\u2019s feed as a reliable source of company information, with many investors initially believing Tuesday\u2019s tweet was a prank.  \u201cMusk\u2019s irreverence and showmanship is part of the Tesla brand, I get that, but I don\u2019t think the securities laws do,\u201d said Fallon.

FILE PHOTO: The Tesla logo is seen on a car in Los Angeles, California, U.S., July 9, 2020. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  Merger activity within the S&P 500 .SPX has historically been the biggest reason companies leave the index, and could provide an opening for a company like Tesla, said two sources familiar with how the committee has made decisions.  While some in the market have questioned the quality of Tesla\u2019s earnings, it was still widely expected to gain entry to the benchmark.  \u201cIt will go into the S&P. There\u2019s no way it cannot at some point,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s in the penalty box right now while they just assess the situation.\u201d  While Tesla\u2019s valuation \u201cseems absolutely crazy\u201d the company cannot be ignored, he added.  A spokesman for S&P declined to comment. Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Picking which companies make it in the S&P 500 is part science, part art. There are formal criteria a company is expected to meet, around things like profitability, share float and market capitalization, but the index committee has leeway in deciding who makes the cut.  The S&P 500\u2019s aim is not to beat the market, but to emulate the performance of its 11 sectors, as well the 156 sub-industries within those sectors.  Tesla, as an automaker, is part of the consumer discretionary sector, which currently has an 11.4% weighting in the index. That sector also includes companies like retailers, home builders and restaurants.  The index committee aims to pick the companies that best represent their industries, while keeping the weighting of the sector in check against the others, which include information technology, health care, and financials, so the index\u2019s performance matches that of the overall market, one source said.  Mergers among companies in the index give committee members - the names of whom S&P does not make public - additional opportunities to readjust weightings based on the ever-changing dynamic of the market.  Tesla\u2019s shares, for instance, have skyrocketted more than 300% this year, making it the world\u2019s most valuable automaker, and changing the entire sector\u2019s footprint. Since the S&P\u2019s latest index decision, Tesla stock is down more than 10%.  When Tesla in July reported its fourth-straight quarterly profit, one condition for S&P 500 entry, many investors believed it was destined for admission, helping fuel the rally in the company\u2019s shares.  But Tesla was not on the list of new additions announced Sept. 4 ahead of the index\u2019s quarterly rebalancing on Sept. 18.  The committee\u2019s decision \u201ccan only have come from a collective and committed view that (Tesla) is profoundly over-valued and sits on shakier fundamentals than its mega market cap indicates,\u201d said DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas.  Still, he said he was \u201csurprised\u201d Tesla was not admitted.  The omission came as Tesla\u2019s latest earnings showed the sale of emissions credits to other carmakers helped make up for losses in its core autos business.  At any moment there are 25 to 50 companies that technically qualify to be in the index, but are not in, and a handful of those are companies the committee agrees are acceptable candidates when discussed in its monthly meetings, one source said.  With a big name like Tesla, it is tempting to look for a big exit from the index, the person said, adding that the committee tracks announced mergers, which are opportunities to make unscheduled additions.

He also sent shockwaves throughout the investment banking world, which reacted to the news with both excitement and bewilderment.  This is because no company of Tesla\u2019s size has ever been taken private by financial investors as Musk has suggested, as opposed to being acquired by a bigger company. Moreover, the standard method of doing so, saddling the company with debt in a so-called leveraged buyout, is not an option for Tesla given that is already servicing a debt mountain of some $11 billion and is not making any money. It reported an operating loss in 2017 of $1.6 billion.  Debate over the deal\u2019s feasibility has polarized bankers. During one conference call at an investment bank last week, discussion on whether the deal represented a major opportunity or a fools\u2019 errand degenerated into a shouting match, according to one of the bankers who provided the details on condition that neither he nor the bank, which decided not to pursue a role, are disclosed.  \"Given the size of a deal, the company's debt capacity and cash flow, bankers seem similarly chary about this deal happening anytime soon,\" said Stefan Selig, a former top Bank of America Corp BAC.N banker who is the founder of financial and strategic advisory firm BridgePark Advisors LLC, which is not involved in the deal.  Bankers aspiring to advise on the deal are courting Musk and Tesla\u2019s special board committee that will independently consider the merits of Musk\u2019s expected offer.  Working for Musk could also come with reputational risk, given that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the factual accuracy of his assertion on Twitter that funding for the deal was secured, sources have said.  However, many bankers said this would not be a deterrent given the magnitude of the potential deal.  \u201cThat\u2019s likely not enough to color a banker\u2019s view on whether or not there is an opportunity,\u201d said Ted Smith, a co-founder and partner of Union Square Advisors, a technology boutique investment bank. Union Square is not trying to win a role in the Tesla deal.  Musk, who owns about a fifth of Tesla, said in a blog post (link - bit.ly\/2B9n7Ea) last week the effective size of the deal would be much smaller than the $72 billion equity valuation of his offer, because, according to his estimate, two-thirds of the company's shareholders would choose the option he will offer them of \"rolling\" their stakes and continue to be investors in a private company, rather than cash out.  Musk also said that Saudi Arabia\u2019s PIF, which became a Tesla shareholder earlier this year with a stake of just under 5 percent, could help him fund the cash portion of the deal, through sources close to the secretive sovereign wealth fund have played down that prospect.  TROPHY DEAL  There is no precedent for major institutional shareholders and thousands of mom-and-pop investors rolling their stakes in a transaction of this size, and legal experts have warned that carrying this out would require navigating a regulatory minefield.  If the deal was structured like a leveraged buyout, advisers to Tesla could earn $90 million to $120 million in fees, while advisers to Musk\u2019s investor group would earn $30 million to $50 million, and debt financing fees could reach $500 million, according to estimates from financial advisory firm Freeman & Co.  However, if the Tesla deal is done with equity partners and little debt, as Musk envisions, the fees would be substantially lower, according to Freeman, making it more of a trophy rather than a lucrative assignment for bankers.  Last week, bankers at Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N decided to take the plunge by offering to advise Musk. Goldman bankers have had close ties with him for more than a decade, leading Tesla's initial public offering in 2010. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.  Morgan Stanley equity research analysts said on Tuesday they had ceased coverage of Tesla, and sources confirmed that the bank was also close to being hired by Musk.  Tesla has declined to comment on the matter.  This is despite Morgan Stanley currently advising aspiring Tesla rival Lucid Motors Inc on attracting a potential investment from PIF, sources told Reuters. Morgan Stanley has been a top financier of Tesla over the years, making it a prime candidate to arrange any debt financing needed, the sources said.  Morgan Stanley declined to comment.  Still up for grabs is the financial advisory mandate to be awarded by Tesla's special committee. Evercore Partners Inc EVR.N, which advised Tesla two years ago in its $2.6 billion acquisition of renewable energy company SolarCity and is also advising PIF on its potential investment in Lucid Motors, is one of the banks vying to advise Tesla's special committee, according to the sources. Evercore declined to comment.  Other investment banks vying for the Tesla special committee financial advisory role include Centerview Partners, Lazard Ltd LAZ.N, Moelis & Co MC.N, and Perella Weinberg Partners LP, according to the sources. The banks did not respond to requests for comment.

After several years of production troubles and delays at Tesla, Panasonic is beginning to see its decade-old partnership with the U.S. company become a profit driver.  Panasonic announced in October that it was developing a new battery cell designed by Tesla, one that would help Tesla halve battery costs and ramp up battery production 100-fold by 2030.  \u201cFrom the next business year we want to end the question of whether (the Tesla) business will be profitable or not,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Hirokazu Umeda said on a call.  The Japanese electronics conglomerate is also planning to add a new production line at the Nevada factory it owns with Tesla, and is looking at building a lithium-ion battery business in Norway in a bid to tap European carmakers.  Panasonic plans to start test production for the new line - for Tesla\u2019s 4680 battery - in the financial year beginning April 1, Umeda said.  The Japanese company, which gets revenue from product lines ranging from bicycles to hair dryers, said it was also benefiting from pandemic-driven buying of home appliances and sales of 5G equipment. But these were offset by weakness in businesses such as in-flight entertainment systems.  Its new forecast of 230 billion yen ($2.2 billion) for the year to end-March - up from 150 billion yen - is still 22% below the previous year.  More than a third of that profit will come from sales of appliances.  Under outgoing Chief Executive Kazuhiro Tsuga, Panasonic has shifted away from its low-profit home electronics business to focus on housing fixtures, car electronics and batteries for electric vehicles.  The company announced in November that Tsuga would step down in April after nine years at the helm and that Yuki Kusumi, the current head of its automotive business, would take over.  For the three months ending Dec. 31 the company posted a 30% rise in operating profit to 130.2 billion yen, above a Refinitiv estimate of 74.6 billion yen from four analysts.

The settlement comes as a trial is scheduled to start on March 16 in Delaware in which shareholders seek $2.6 billion in damages, the entire cost of the SolarCity deal.  A lawyer for Musk and a spokesman for Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Tesla shareholders have alleged Musk breached his fiduciary duties, squandered Tesla\u2019s assets and unjustly enriched himself by pushing to buy the money-losing solar company in which he was the biggest investor.  The settlement covered five current directors, Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio Gracias, Stephen Jurvetson and Kimbal Musk. Brad Buss, who was a director at the time of the SolarCity deal, was also part of the settlement, which was paid from insurance policies, according to court documents.  Bloomberg reported the settlement was worth $60 million.  \u201cPlaintiffs probably think they have a cleaner shot on the merits if the only issues they have to raise are with Elon Musk and Elon Musk\u2019s actions,\u201d said Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School.  The case was brought in the Court of Chancery in Delaware, where Tesla is incorporated, by an individual investor and five investment funds.  Tesla said in a statement to Reuters in September the allegations were \u201cbased on the claims of plaintiff\u2019s lawyers looking for a payday, and are not representative of our shareholders.\u201d  The suit represents another legal headache for Musk, who in the past two years has settled a lawsuit by securities regulators over his use of Twitter and won a defamation trial brought by a British cave explorer.  Musk and the Tesla board also are scheduled to defend Musk\u2019s pay package at a trial in Delaware next year.  At the heart of the current case are allegations that Musk and the other board members did not fully disclose the depth of SolarCity\u2019s problems, or their own conflicts.  SolarCity was founded in 2006 by Musk and his cousins, Lyndon Rive and Peter Rive, who were the company\u2019s CEO and chief technology officer as well as directors. Musk was SolarCity\u2019s chairman and largest shareholder, and five of Tesla\u2019s directors were direct or indirect owners of SolarCity stock.  Entering 2016, SolarCity\u2019s stock was on a sharp downward trajectory and the company was slashing its workforce and bleeding cash.  Tesla touted synergies of combining the companies in the all-stock deal, which was approved by Tesla shareholders.  After the deal closed, Tesla slashed its solar sales force and ended a solar marketing deal with Home Depot. Quarterly solar installations plummeted and are well below levels SolarCity enjoyed in its heyday.  Tesla has said Musk\u2019s involvement in deal discussions and all other material information were accurately described to shareholders in public filings before the deal closed.  On Wednesday, Tesla reported its second straight quarterly profit, sending its stock surging to an all-time high.

The automaker\u2019s website showed it is looking to fill 14 roles including architectural designer and senior finance manager. Most of the positions are senior in level and require at least six years\u2019 experience, the job descriptions showed.  Tesla did not respond to Reuters\u2019 requests for comment. The 21st Century Herald newspaper, which reported the job postings on Tuesday, said Tesla began advertising the roles on Sunday.  Tesla last month signed agreements with Shanghai authorities to build its first factory outside the United States, which would double the size of the EV maker\u2019s global manufacturing.  Chief Executive Elon Musk on an earnings call this month said the factory would cost around $2 billion and that the EV maker planned to fund the project with local debt.

Sales in China rose 64% to $669 million and its other segment, which covers the rest of the globe, rose by more than a billion dollars to $1.83 billion, a regulatory filing showed.  \u201cMusk & Co. are laser-focused on Europe and China for growth, while domestically, core demand is fading relative to other regions,\u201d Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said, adding that U.S. growth will remain more challenging going forward.  In its earnings report earlier this month, Tesla reported a nearly 8% drop in total revenue to $6.30 billion, missing analysts\u2019 average estimate of $6.33 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. It did not break down sales by geography in the report.  The company, however, surprised investors with a quarterly profit, making good on Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk\u2019s promise, as it delivered a record 97,000 cars.  The company has said it plans to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles for all of 2019, and that it was \u201chighly confident in exceeding 360,000 deliveries this year.\u201d  The drop in sales in its domestic market in the latest reported quarter compares with a 55% rise in the second quarter ended June.  Tesla did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the reason for the fall in the U.S. market.  Tesla is expanding its service in other markets including China and Europe, as Musk is under pressure to make Tesla sustainably profitable, while still spending on major initiatives ranging from a Shanghai factory and assembly-line to upcoming models such as the Model Y SUV and a Semi commercial truck.  The company forecast capital expenditure to be slightly below $1.5 billion in 2019.  In the filing, Tesla also said it had a provision for warranty of $138 million in the third quarter versus $187 million last year.

All three major U.S. stock indexes opened at record highs as traders cheered upbeat economic data from China, but quickly pared gains in the absence of any new information on an initial Sino-U.S. trade agreement.  The world\u2019s top two economies announced their Phase 1 deal earlier this month, but have since disclosed few concrete details. Beijing said this week it was in close contact with Washington on the pact.  \u201cThese moves are expected in the absence of anything earth-shaking happening,\u201d said Katrina Lamb, head of investment strategy and research at MV Financial, in Bethesda, Maryland.  \u201cWe\u2019ve had such a long run so far that it now feels a bit overstretched.\u201d  Robust U.S. economic data, relatively loose monetary policy and hopes of an imminent trade truce between Beijing and Washington have sent the S&P 500 index to several record highs this month.  The benchmark index is about half a percentage point shy of logging its best year since 1997, while the Nasdaq has now posted 11 straight opening records, crossing the 9,000 mark on Thursday.  Signaling resilience in the global economy, data on Friday showed China\u2019s industrial profits grew at the fastest pace in eight months in November.  Still, some analysts have cautioned that weakness in Chinese demand remains a risk for company earnings next year.

The Nasdaq Composite was down 8.14 points, or 0.09%, at 9,014.25.

T. Rowe Price Group Inc funds, once the No. 2 Tesla shareholder after Musk, cut their holdings by nearly a quarter to 11.9 million shares in the three months ended June 30, according to a filing on Tuesday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The disclosure comes days after Fidelity Investments, another top-10 shareholder, said in an earlier filing it cut its Tesla stake by 21 percent during the quarter.  Musk faces investor lawsuits claiming fraud and a reported SEC probe after sending a tweet on August 7 that there was \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private. No investors have confirmed their involvement.  Tesla\u2019s board named a special committee on Tuesday to evaluate any plans to go private but said it had not seen a firm offer.  It was not clear why T. Rowe Price and Fidelity reduced their Tesla holdings or whether they support a move by the company to go private. During the second quarter, investors were focused on the company\u2019s efforts to turn out new Model 3 sedans without burning cash at a faster pace.  In addition to stock, Fidelity and T. Rowe Price retained a type of bond issued by Tesla that can convert to stock under certain conditions, their filings showed.  A representative of Tesla did not respond to inquiries from Reuters. Fidelity and T. Rowe Price declined to comment.  CFRA analyst Efraim Levy said there could be many reasons why the funds trimmed their positions. Some also may not be allowed to hold the company\u2019s stock if it goes private.  \u201cA lot of these mutual funds, who are the large shareholders, they can\u2019t necessarily buy and hold private company\u2019s stock,\u201d he said.

Slideshow ( 5 images )  Another brokerage, Baird, cut its price target for the company to $340 from $400, saying concerns over demand, credibility and noise around the company have kept incremental buyers out of the market.  \u201cThe departure of key executives, price discounting, and extraordinary cost-cutting efforts add to the narrative of a company facing real potential stress,\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s Jonas said.  An early backer of Tesla, Jonas in 2011 set a price target of $70 on the stock when it was trading around $23, a year after its IPO at $17 apiece. In 2017, he said the Tesla Network alone, Musk\u2019s plan for a robotaxi fleet, was worth $76 a share.  His bear case doesn\u2019t ascribe any value to robocabs but if the plan works, Jonas, who was once criticized in a New York Times article for being a cheerleader for Tesla, has a bull-case price target of $391.  The market action follows hot on the heels of a $2.7 billion fundraising round by the company two weeks ago that was oversubscribed, but has done little to settle the nerves of holders of Tesla\u2019s existing debt.  Its $1.8 billion high-yield bond due in 2025 with a 5.3% coupon weakened for a third straight day in European trading, with its price edging below 82 cents on the dollar and the yield up to 9.16% after touching a record high 9.25% overnight.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  The spread of its yield over Treasury securities, a gauge of the added compensation demanded by investors for holding Tesla rather than safer government debt, widened to nearly 693 basis points.  By comparison, the average spread on corporate bonds rated \u201cB\u201d - roughly the same as \u201cB-\u201d rated Tesla - is 442 basis points, according to ICE BofAML bond index data.  It was also among Wall Street\u2019s more heavily shorted stocks, with about a fifth of its float on the line.  \u201cFAANG stocks continue to dominate the list of most shorted U.S. equities ... but Tesla continues to hold the number 1 or number 2 spot since 2016,\u201d according to financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners.  Of 31 analysts who cover the stock, 10 now recommend buying Tesla shares, nine are neutral and 12 recommend selling, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. The median price target is $250.19, a fifth above the current market.  While cutting their price target, Baird analysts reiterated their outperform rating, saying Tesla was \u201cpositioned to outperform over the long run, as it increases profitability, generates free cash flow and ramps up production of innovating products\u201d.","517":"* Tesla shares up after Musk says co to meet Model 3 goal  * Facebook falls after data security issue, weighs on Nasdaq  * Indexes up: Dow 0.80 pct, S&P 0.38 pct, Nasdaq 0.23 pct (Changes comment, adds details, updates prices)  June 6 (Reuters) - Wall Street edged higher on Wednesday as banks stocks lifted the S&P 500 and the Dow, while gains for Amazon and Tesla helped the Nasdaq notch another day of record gains.  Tesla shares rose 6.1 percent after billionaire Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk reassured shareholders that building 5,000 of its mass-market Model 3 cars per week by the end of June was \u201cquite likely\u201d.  However, Facebook fell 1.3 percent after the social networking company confirmed it had collaborated with at least four Chinese companies that involved sharing certain user data.  Technology stocks have been on a tear in the recent days, resilient to issues that have roiled the financial markets including trade talks between the United States and its partners, geopolitical worries and rising interest rates.  \u201cThere\u2019s a strong fundamental background and evidence that effects of tax reforms are still largely ahead, and in the real economy they are starting to flow through,\u201d Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta, Georgia said.  Facebook and Google parent Alphabet, in the largest-ever shakeup of the stock market\u2019s broad business sectors, will move from the top-performing technology sector to telecommunications and media stocks.  Analysts have said that the move could inject more volatility into the markets as funds tracking these indexes will be forced to trade billions of dollars of stock to realign their holdings by a Sept. 28 effective date.  U.S. officials were weighing an offer by China to import an extra $70 billion of American goods over a year as Beijing tries to defuse a potential trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies, according to sources.  U.S. President Donald Trump is due to attend a G7 summit in Canada later this week, where leaders were likely to discuss the global economy and concerns about U.S. trade policy.  Trump last week pushed on with imposing the tariffs \u2014 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum \u2014 on Canada, the EU and Mexico, with Mexico retaliating by putting tariffs on American products ranging from steel to pork and bourbon.  The benchmark U.S. Treasury yield rose to a near two-week high after data showed that U.S. trade deficit unexpectedly fell to a seven-month low in April, supporting the view of an acceleration of domestic economic growth in the second quarter.  Bank stocks often trade in line with Treasury yields, as higher rates can boost their profits. The S&P banking index was up 1.8 percent.  At 11:56 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 199.27 points, or 0.80 percent, at 24,999.25, the S&P 500 was up 10.50 points, or 0.38 percent, at 2,759.30 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 17.86 points, or 0.23 percent, at 7,655.72.

REUTERS\/Noah Berger\/File Photo  \u201cJust want to [sic] that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work,\u201d Musk, a frequent critic of investors betting against the electric car company, wrote on Twitter. \u201cAnd the name change is so on point!\u201d  The tweet came five days after Musk settled SEC charges that he misled investors in tweets on Aug. 7, including that there was \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take his Palo Alto, California-based company private at $420 per share.  Musk agreed to pay a $20 million fine, and step aside as Tesla\u2019s chairman for three years, to settle charges that could have forced his exit from Tesla. The company also accepted a $20 million fine, despite not being charged with fraud.  Tesla and the SEC declined requests for comment.  Former SEC lawyers questioned the wisdom of Musk\u2019s latest tweet, but said it was unlikely to jeopardize the settlement, which prevents Musk from denying wrongdoing or suggesting that the regulator\u2019s allegations were untrue.  \u201cI don\u2019t think the SEC would look at this as a denial of the facts alleged,\u201d said Peter Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit. \u201cBut you don\u2019t take gratuitous shots at the SEC. There\u2019s no real upside.\u201d  Shares of Tesla closed down $12.97, or 4.4 percent, at $281.83, and fell another 2.1 percent to $276 following Musk\u2019s tweet after market hours.  The tweet came less than four hours after U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan ordered Musk and the SEC to explain by Oct. 11 in a joint letter why their settlement was fair and reasonable and would not hurt the public interest.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Nathan said it was her regular practice to request such letters.  \u201cShe may want to know why Tesla is paying a fine because the CEO doesn\u2019t know when to shut up,\u201d said Adam Pritchard, a University of Michigan law professor and former SEC lawyer.  Musk\u2019s tweet on Thursday received more than 2,500 responses, with some users questioning the billionaire\u2019s judgment.  \u201cSeriously? You know you still need their help convincing a judge that your penalty was sufficient... Maybe a 420M fine would have been more appropriate?\u201d one Twitter follower said. The proposed take-private price was $420 a share.  Musk replied, \u201cthe opposite is true.\u201d  He has used Twitter to criticize short-sellers betting against his company.  In a separate rambling tweet, he took another shot at short-sellers and accused BlackRock Inc of enabling them by saying, \u201cThe big funds can & will [sic], as they\u2019re suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket [sic] make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for \u2018passive\u2019 index tracking.\u201d  BlackRock declined to comment on Musk\u2019s tweet.  DEFERENCE TO SEC  The settlement also required Tesla\u2019s board to implement procedures for reviewing Musk\u2019s communications with investors, which include tweets.  Thomas Gorman, a partner at Dorsey & Whitney in Washington, D.C., said Musk might argue that the latest tweet might be a mere \u201cpersonal lament,\u201d and not a violation of the settlement.  For her part, Nathan may have limited room to intervene, after a federal appeals court curbed the ability of judges to reject SEC settlements.  One such judge was Jed Rakoff, a colleague of Nathan\u2019s who objected to the SEC policy of letting some corporate defendants settle without admitting or denying wrongdoing, as Musk did.  But in 2014, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Rakoff\u2019s rejection of a $285 million SEC settlement with Citigroup Inc, saying he should have given \u201csignificant deference\u201d to the regulator.  The 2nd Circuit has jurisdiction over Nathan\u2019s court, and lawyers said Musk\u2019s settlement would likely win approval, though orders such as Nathan\u2019s are not too common.  \u201cIn and of itself it\u2019s not an ominous sign,\u201d said Jordan Thomas, a partner at Labaton Sucharow and former SEC lawyer. \u201cThe vast majority of settlements like this are approved by courts.\u201d  Pritchard said before Musk\u2019s tweet that he saw no \u201cserious chance\u201d for a rejection of Musk\u2019s settlement, based on 2nd Circuit precedent. \u201cThis is just a hoop to be jumped through,\u201d he said.

Tesla started delivering China-made Model 3 electric sedans from its $2 billion Shanghai factory in December, but some buyers said on Chinese social media that the control units in their cars run on HW2.5 chips, which are less advanced than the HW3.0 chips listed on their specification sheets.  The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology urged Tesla on Tuesday to ensure product consistency, quality and safety, according to a statement on the ministry\u2019s website.  HW3.0 chips are necessary for the Full Self-Driving mode in Tesla\u2019s driver assistance system, a feature that is optional when customers order Tesla cars.  In a post on its Weibo account last week, Tesla said the swap was due to a lack of supply of the HW3.0 chips and the company would replace the chip for customers who received cars with the HW2.5 systems.  Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Tesla\u2019s production and delivery plans in Shanghai have been disrupted by a coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 3,100 people in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.

By building a plant in Germany, Tesla will be able to add the \u201cMade in Germany\u201d accolade. Berlin also has earmarked financial support for manufacturing electric car battery cells.  Musk, in a tweet, said that Tesla will build batteries, powertrains and vehicles, starting with Model Y lower-priced sports utility vehicle at the Berlin factory.  Last month, Tesla said it expected its European factory to start production in 2021. The carmaker is also gearing up to open its factory in Shanghai.  Musk made the announcement about the Berlin plant at the Golden Steering Wheel awards ceremony in Germany. He said the factory will be near the new Berlin airport. Musk had said in June last year that Germany is the frontrunner for its first factory in Europe.  \u201cTesla is coming to Brandenburg with a big investment,\u201d Dietmar Woidke, state premier of Brandenburg, which surrounds Berlin, said in a statement. \u201cWe lobbied for this for a long time in intensive talks and with good arguments.\u201d  The company is yet to prove it can be consistently profitable. Tesla has said it expects to be cash flow positive, but faces big investments with the launch of new factories and development of products including a pickup truck and a semi-truck.  Musk\u2019s appearance at the awards ceremony is another example of Tesla\u2019s efforts to co-opt marketing tactics employed by German manufacturers, which have a reputation for quality.  Tesla, for instance, has tested its cars on the Nordschleife, the notorious northern loop of the Nuerburgring racing track, as a way to burnish the brand\u2019s reputation for reliability and sporting prowess.  The company has an engineering firm in Pruem, Germany, that specializes in automated manufacturing systems for battery-making plants.  In October, Reuters reported that Tesla is aiming to start production for its factory in China amid uncertainties around orders, labor and suppliers.","523":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O has temporarily suspended its Model 3 assembly line in what the company said on Monday was a planned production pause, as the automaker continues to face challenges ramping up its new sedan.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  It was the second time since February that Tesla has temporarily shut down its production line for the Model 3 at its Fremont, California plant.  \u201cThese periods are used to improve automation and systematically address bottlenecks in order to increase production rates,\u201d a Tesla representative said on Monday.  BuzzFeed, which first reported the news, said workers were expected to use vacation days or stay home without pay during the four- to five-day production pause.  After repeated delays in production of its Model 3 sedan, Tesla is now trying to catch up to a target of building 2,500 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter. Problems within its heavily roboticized assembly line have complicated those efforts.  On Friday, Musk acknowledged for the first time that he had overrelied on automation in the Model 3 assembly line, a stunning concession from Tesla\u2019s leader who has previously scoffed at competitors\u2019 manufacturing prowess and bragged about creating an \u201cAlien Dreadnought\u201d within the Fremont factory by 2018.  \u201cYes, excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake,\u201d Musk tweeted on Friday. \u201cTo be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated.\u201d  He also tweeted on Friday that Tesla would be profitable and cash flow positive in the third and fourth quarters, with no need to raise money.  Many analysts dispute this analysis, which hinges on a rapid rise in production of the Model 3 sedan. Delays and lower-than-expected volume have postponed revenue from cars being delivered to customers from reaching Tesla\u2019s bottom line.  Shares did not move after hours after falling 3 percent on Monday, pressured by Musk\u2019s acknowledgement, a report alleging that Tesla undercounted worker injuries - which the company denies - and an amended lawsuit originally filed last year that alleges Musk misled investors about Model 3 production.  In February, Tesla suspended production of its Model 3 for four days in what it said was planned work to adjust equipment in order to improve automation and address bottlenecks. It warned of possibly more periods of downtime in coming months.  Automakers generally do stop or slow production of new models to iron out problems with the production system, although Tesla took shortcuts with the testing of its production line in order to get to market more quickly, shortcuts that some experts say have resulted in early manufacturing problems.","524":"RIYADH (Reuters) - Elon Musk told investors this week that \u201cobviously, the Saudi sovereign fund has more than enough capital needed\u201d to finance taking Tesla private.  FILE PHOTO: Elon Musk, founder, CEO and lead designer at SpaceX and co-founder of Tesla, speaks at the International Space Station Research and Development Conference in Washington, U.S., July 19, 2017. REUTERS\/Aaron P. Bernstein\/File Photo  The fund is estimated to have over $250 billion in assets. But it is not that simple.  The Public Investment Fund (PIF) has many claims on its resources, both financial and political.  More than half of its assets are tied up in large Saudi companies whose stocks could be difficult to sell en masse.  The PIF has made substantial commitments to other technology companies or investments, including a $45 billion agreement to invest in a giant tech fund led by Japan\u2019s Softbank.  Then there\u2019s $3.5 billion invested in U.S. ride-sharing firm Uber, the $1 billion pumped into Virgin Group\u2019s space ventures, and another $20 billion tentatively committed to an infrastructure investment fund planned with Blackstone.  There is also pressure to spend money at home, where a slumping economy has driven unemployment among Saudi citizens to record highs.  \u201cThey could handle part of taking Tesla private, but not necessarily a large part of it and certainly not all of it,\u201d a banker at a major Gulf firm operating in Saudi Arabia said.  Musk has not put a formal buyout proposal to Tesla\u2019s board, the company said on Tuesday.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The Tesla CEO has said he does not believe he would need to raise the full $72 billion value placed on Tesla by his $420-a-share bid because he expects many existing shareholders \u2013 including himself with 20 percent of the company \u2013 to roll their shares into a private Tesla.  The Saudi PIF already holds about a 5 percent stake in Tesla.  Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who heads the PIF, is driving to diversify the Saudi economy beyond oil exports by developing new industries. Participation in a Tesla deal could bring Saudi Arabia closer to developing a domestic car industry or playing a role in Musk\u2019s electric battery manufacturing or space activities.  What Prince Salman, PIF managing director Yasir al-Rumayyan and other officials of the fund decide will be crucial to Musk\u2019s take-private effort.  Musk said on Monday that al-Rumayyan had voiced support for Tesla going private and that talks with the PIF, along with other investors, were continuing.  Spokesmen for the fund, as well as Saudi government officials, have so far declined any comment on Musk\u2019s statements. But bankers familiar with the secretive PIF said on Tuesday they had seen no sign yet of it preparing to commit to a Tesla deal.  ILLIQUID ASSETS  Those bankers added that although the fund is huge, many of its assets are not liquid and readily available cash is limited.  The PIF said last October that it had some $230 billion of assets under management, and analysts think this figure has now probably swelled to more than $250 billion, largely as a result of a rise in the Saudi stock market.  But stock exchange data shows $140 billion or more of the PIF\u2019s assets are in big Saudi companies such as Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) and National Commercial Bank.  These could not be monetized quickly without driving down prices in the local stock market, while selling many of them would conflict with another of the PIF\u2019s declared roles, to helps Saudi firms \u201cgrow into regional and global leaders\u201d.  Meanwhile, in Saudi Arabia\u2019s illiquid market, selling real estate to raise money does not look like a near-term option.  \u201cThe PIF is not nearly as liquid as people might like to think,\u201d an international banker who deals with the fund said.  However, the PIF may get two infusions of cash in the coming months and is seeking to raise between $6 billion and $8 billion in its first commercial loan, sources have told Reuters, adding that there was no mention of any acquisition linked to the debt.  And national oil giant Saudi Aramco said last month it was working on a possible purchase of a strategic stake in SABIC from the PIF. A complete purchase of the PIF\u2019s 70 percent holding would give the fund about $70 billion.  Bankers expect the Aramco purchase to take at least several months to negotiate, however, and the PIF has already committed itself to large projects planned to stimulate the Saudi economy.  These include a $500 billion business zone in the northwest of the country, multi-billion dollar real estate developments in Mecca and Medina, and a huge entertainment area outside Riyadh.  \u201cIf it spends tens of billions of dollars overseas and the domestic economy is still slumping, it won\u2019t look good to some Saudis,\u201d the Gulf banker said.","525":"(Repeats to additional subscribers; no change to headline or text)  DETROIT, March 3 (Reuters) - General Motors Co executives on Wednesday will tackle one of their toughest tasks: Persuading investors that a Detroit automaker can catch up with Elon Musk and Tesla Inc as vehicles go electric.  Even as global markets reel from coronavirus fears, Tesla\u2019s valuation is outpacing that of GM and most other legacy automakers. On Tuesday, Tesla\u2019s market cap hovered around $144 billion, more than three times GM\u2019s $45 billion.  GM is by far the larger manufacturer by volume, and generates more cash and profits. But in the electric vehicle market, Tesla is the leader.  Last year, Tesla sold 367,500 electric vehicles globally, including 223,000 in the United States. GM sold just 16,400 Chevrolet Bolt EVs to U.S. buyers, and 60,000 Baojun E-Series models in China with joint venture partner SAIC Motor .  GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra and President Mark Reuss have ramped up electric vehicle development over the past three years, focusing on a proprietary battery, a low-cost flexible vehicle design and a blueprint for high-volume production, mainly in China.  The company has revealed its electric vehicle strategy in incremental steps - announcing the Hummer brand will be reborn as an electric pickup and partnering with Korean battery maker LG Chem to build a $2.3 billion battery plant near a shuttered GM car plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM is now trying to put the broader picture into focus for investors.  GM has said it aims to reduce the cost of battery cells - the single greatest expense in electric vehicles - to less than $100 per kilowatt-hour. That in turn could slash the cost of battery packs for electric vehicles like the Chevrolet Bolt EV by up to 45%, experts say.  GM is also developing an advanced battery, in partnership with LG Chem and Japan\u2019s Honda Motor Co, that will be smaller than current EV batteries, can be charged more quickly and will provide more energy.  Musk has told investors that Tesla has battery cost and range breakthroughs in the works that it will describe at a \u201cBattery Day\u201d in April.  Barra has said GM plans to spend more on electric vehicles than on gasoline-powered cars over the next five years. But it has not put a figure on how much it will invest in its efforts to rival Tesla and traditional competitors such as Volkswagen AG or Ford Motor Co as the electric vehicle market develops.  Barra has, however, promised that GM will make money on electric cars by 2021.

The disappointing results come after shares of the electric carmaker led by CEO Elon Musk surged nearly 700% over the past 12 months, a valuation rooted in expectations that Tesla will quickly and profitably expand.  Investors had hoped for a significant increase over the company\u2019s 2020 delivery goal of half a million vehicles, but Tesla provided only a vague outlook and did not state a concrete delivery goal.  \u201cOver a multi-year horizon, we expect to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries. In some years we may grow faster, which we expect to be the case in 2021,\u201d Tesla said in a statement.  The fuzzy guidance also comes after Musk fanned hopes during an October earnings call. Asked by an analyst whether Tesla aimed to deliver 840,000 to 1 million vehicles in 2021, based on its factories\u2019 current maximum capacity, Musk responded the target was \u201cin that vicinity,\u201d while another Tesla executive said the company would provide guidance next quarter.  Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer, Zachary Kirkhorn, said on Wednesday the company was \u201cworking extremely hard\u201d to manage through a global shortage of semiconductors that has vexed the auto industry, but did not elaborate.  Tesla delivered 180,570 vehicles during the fourth quarter, a quarterly record, even though it narrowly missed its ambitious 2020 goal of half a million deliveries.  \u201cAfter Tesla\u2019s unprecedented run in 2020, investors were anticipating a substantial earnings beat and another big target for car deliveries in 2021,\u201d said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com.  Investors and analysts during an earnings call were keen to learn more about Tesla\u2019s pace of growth, including when it would book more revenue for its automated driving features, but they received few concrete answers.

COMPETITION HEATING UP  While Tesla has increased deliveries overall, the company on Wednesday said the average sales price per vehicle dipped 11% on a yearly basis, with more consumers switching to the less expensive Model 3 and Model Y.  Net income excluding share-based compensation payouts to Musk rose to $903 million from $386 million last year, but the company fell short of average analyst expectations for a $1.08 billion quarterly profit, according to data from Refinitiv.  At $10.74 billion, Tesla quarterly revenue slightly surpassed analyst expectations of $10.4 billion.  Under Musk\u2019s leadership, Tesla significantly expanded its footprint in 2020, bucking a pandemic and economic upheaval with steady sales and profitable quarters at a time when many carmakers reported losses. Its success allowed Tesla to join the S&P 500 Index, defying long-term skeptics who had bet against the company.  The high-profile CEO, who is also at the helm of rocket maker SpaceX, said on Wednesday he expects to run Tesla for several more years, but added it would \u201cbe nice to have a bit more free time on my hands.\u201d  Throughout 2020, Tesla ramped up production in China and last month began selling its locally made Model Y sport utility vehicle there at a price analysts say will disrupt the conventional premium car market. But the company faces growing competition by local challengers, including Nio Inc and Xpeng Inc.  Tesla has also begun building vehicle and battery manufacturing factories near Berlin, Germany, and Austin, Texas, and on Wednesday said it remained on track to start deliveries from each location this year.  But within the auto industry, the race is now on to develop electric vehicles to meet emissions targets and challenge Tesla\u2019s market lead.  Several carmakers are slated to release new EV models this year, including sport utility vehicles to compete with the Model Y, such as Ford Motor Co\u2019s Mustang Mach-E and Volkswagen AG\u2019s ID.4. Challenges to Tesla\u2019s yet-to-be released Cybertruck come from General Motors Co\u2019s electric Hummer truck.  Tesla on Wednesday said Cybertruck volume production would begin in 2022.  Competitors\u2019 uptick in EV sales will also dry up Tesla\u2019s income from environmental regulatory credits, which it sells to other automakers.  In the fourth quarter, $401 million, or 4% of Tesla\u2019s automotive revenue, came from those credits.","527":"TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T unveiled a completely redesigned hydrogen-powered fuel cell sedan on Friday in its latest attempt to revive demand for the niche technology that it hopes will become mainstream.

The new Mirai model boasts longer driving range than its predecessor and completely redesigned fuel cell stack and hydrogen tanks, the company said.  \u201cWe wanted to make a car that people really want to buy, not just because it\u2019s an eco car,\u201d Yoshikazu Tanaka, chief engineer of the new Mirai, said at the unveiling.  \u201cWe wanted something that\u2019s fun to drive.\u201d  Its sporty redesign with longer wheelbase and lower-slung chassis is a marked departure from the first-generation Mirai, which looks like a bulked-up Prius hybrid.  The new car also has a 30% improvement in driving range over the previous iteration\u2019s approximately 700 kilometers (435 miles), according to the company.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Tanaka said the latest Mirai would cost less to make than its predecessor, because of a shift to mass production. The current model is mostly assembled by hand.  Costing consumers about 5 million yen ($46,500) after subsidies in Japan, the original Mirai is one of three fuel cell cars available to consumers. Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS sells the Nexo, while Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T leases out the Clarity.  Toyota has sold fewer than 10,000 of the Mirai, a fuel cell sedan it touted as a game changer at its launch five years ago. By contrast, Tesla sold 25,000 of battery-powered Model S sedans in its first year and a half.  Toyota declined to disclose a price for the model and said it would be available from late next year in Japan, North America and Europe.","528":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Friday said it had opened a formal investigation into around 115,0000 Tesla vehicles over a front suspension safety issue.  The auto safety regulator said it was opening a preliminary evaluation into 2015-2017 Model S and 2016-2017 Model X vehicles after receiving 43 complaints alleging failure of the left or right front suspension fore links.  Tesla in February 2017 issued a service bulletin describing a manufacturing condition that may result in front suspension fore link failures, NHTSA said.  Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.  The 2017 service bulletin said some vehicles have \u201cfront fore links that may not meet Tesla strength specifications. In the event of link failure, the driver can still maintain control of the vehicle but the tire may contact the wheel arch liner.\u201d  NHTSA said 32 complaints involved failures that occurred during low-speed parking maneuvers, while 11 occurred while driving. Another eight complaints may also involve the same issue, NHTSA added.  The agency said \u201cthe complaints appear to indicate an increasing trend, with ... three of the incidents at highway speeds reported within the last three months.\u201d  On Nov. 20, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Tesla in the U.S. District Court in California over suspension issues in Model S and X vehicles, claiming defects that can result in the front and rear suspension control arm assembly components prematurely failing.  In October, Tesla told NHTSA it was recalling around 30,000 Model S and Model X vehicles in China for front suspension link issues at the request of Chinese regulators \u201cbecause the environment in China required stronger suspension due to local roads and driving conditions.\u201d Tesla is also issuing a separate rear suspension link recall in China for the Model S vehicles.  But Tesla told NHTSA it did not believe there was any suspension defect and said no U.S. recall was needed, calling the issue \u201cexceedingly rare.\u201d It added it is unaware of any related crashes, injuries, or deaths worldwide.  Last week, NHTSA said it was expanding a separate probe into nearly 159,000 Tesla Model S and Model X vehicles.  NHTSA had opened a preliminary evaluation in June over touchscreen failures. The agency said the failure can result in the loss of rear-camera image display when in reverse and reduced rear visibility when backing up. It can impact defogging ability and audible chimes relating to Autopilot and turn signals.  That probe now covers 2012-2018 model year Tesla Model S and 2016-2018 Model X vehicles. The preliminary investigation covered 63,000 Tesla Model S cars.","529":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Deadly crashes involving Tesla Inc TSLA.O and Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] vehicles operating entirely or in part under automated systems have made a once-abstract problem very real for auto industry lawyers gathered at a recent conference.  A Tesla charging station is seen in Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S. September 28, 2017. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  It is crucial that companies accurately outline limitations of automatic driving systems and the circumstances in which they can and cannot take over steering, braking and lane-keeping, attorneys for the U.S. units of carmakers including Hyundai 011760.KS, Toyota 7203.T, Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE and supplier company Continental CONG.DE said at a recent legal conference.  \u201cThe OEMs (carmakers) right now are trying really hard to accurately describe what this equipment can do and can\u2019t do,\u201d said Tom Vanderford, associate general counsel at Hyundai, at a conference last Friday in Phoenix, Arizona attended by Reuters.  The American Bar Association conference took place just a few miles from the scene of a fatal accident involving an Uber test vehicle in autonomous mode. The crash cranked up pressure on the self-driving vehicle industry to prove its software and sensors are safe.  On Thursday, Tesla came under more pressure from regulators and consumer groups for its response to a deadly crash in California of a Tesla vehicle operating on Autopilot, the name the company uses for an enhanced cruise control system.  Fully automated vehicles are not expected to become available to consumers for several years. However, increasingly sophisticated driver assistance features are already sold under various names, carrying disclaimers warning that drivers cannot rely on the systems to safely operate the car in all circumstances.  Such technologies include collision avoidance systems that steer the car away from pedestrians. There are also automatic braking systems and audio and visual alerts when cameras, radar or other sensors detect obstacles.  David Cades, a human factor scientist at engineering consulting firm Exponent, said terminology matters in descriptions of these systems because people might misuse or misunderstand the technology.  Cades, who has testified in automotive cases as an expert witness, said automakers should not use the term \u201ccollision avoidance system.\u201d Instead, he urged manufacturers to use terms such as \u201ccollision mitigation systems.\u201d  \u201cEven in naming and marketing these systems care needs to be taken in how they are promoted,\u201d Cades said.  John Gersch, managing counsel at Toyota and another conference participant, pointed to a promotional video shown at the conference, in which Tesla TSLA.O touts its Autopilot semi-automated system.  \u201cThe overreliance issue is probably the most serious issue with all these systems, so that goes with Tesla that was shown there,\u201d said Gersch.  Even though its marketing materials feature the automatic system, Tesla\u2019s owners manual tells buyers that they are required to keep their hands on the wheel at all times before activating the system.  The family of a driver killed last month in a Tesla car crash has hired law firm Minami Tamaki LLP to explore legal options, the firm said on Wednesday, adding the Autopilot feature was defective and probably caused his death. Tesla in a statement said Walter Huang, the victim in the California crash, \u201cwas well aware that Autopilot was not perfect.\u201d Tesla added that Huang told his family that Autopilot \u201cwas not reliable in that exact location\u201d of the crash. It said he took his hands off the wheel \u201cseveral times\u201d before the crash.  Investigating a 2016 fatal crash, the National Transportation Safety Board last year said Autopilot lacked safeguards, giving too much leeway to the driver to divert attention. The NTSB in a statement on Thursday urged Tesla to act on the safety recommendations in that report.  Following the 2016 accident, Tesla introduced more frequent warnings to drivers to keep their hands on the wheel. After three warnings, the software now blocks Autopilot until the driver stops and restarts.  \u201cTesla warns, but in products liability warnings don\u2019t protect you against design defect claims,\u201d said University of South Carolina law professor Bryant Walker Smith, who focuses on automated driving.  Car accident litigation usually turns on a driver\u2019s alleged negligence. By contrast, a lawsuit involving automated technology could scrutinize whether the system had a design defect.  Smith said plaintiffs suing Tesla could point to alternative designs, such as General Motors Co's GM.N semi-autonomous Super Cruise system which tracks eye movement to monitor whether a driver pays attention.  GM says Super Cruise relies on a pre-defined map and only allows hands-off driving on designated highways and only when the driver is paying attention to the road.  Any litigation arising from accidents involving fully or partially automated vehicles could also pit software suppliers against vehicle manufacturers.  Industry lawyers said carmakers increasingly indemnify smaller technology companies working on self-driving features.  But Tammy Fanning, deputy general counsel for parts maker Continental, which manufactures radar for blind spot detection systems, told the conference the general automotive liability chain will not change.  \u201cFrom a product liability perspective it will all stay the same: suppliers will be paying for everything in the end, every recall, all replacements,\u201d Fanning said.","530":"NEW YORK\/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle start-up NIO Inc NIO.N priced its shares near the bottom of its targeted price range in its U.S. initial public offering, according to sources familiar with the matter, dragged down by investor concerns about the prospects of chief competitor Tesla Inc TSLA.O.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  Tesla\u2019s struggle to meet its production targets and an abandoned attempt by chief executive Elon Musk to take it private have weighed not just on its own stock, but also on peers looking to develop mass-market electric cars.  Chinese electric carmakers are seeking capital to develop autonomous driving and battery technologies. Beijing wants to rapidly expand China\u2019s production to curb vehicle emissions, boost energy security and promote high-tech industries.  NIO priced its shares at $6.26, just above the low end of its $6.25 to $8.25 target price range, according to four sources familiar with the process. The deal will value the firm at $6.41 billion. It is due to begin trading on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \u201cNIO\u201d.  Earlier, one source told Reuters the deal would price at $6.25 a share.  A representative for NIO did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  NIO, founded by Chinese entrepreneur William Li in 2014, sold $1 billion in shares in the IPO, making it the third-biggest U.S. listing by a Chinese firm this year.  At the start of the IPO process, NIO had hoped for a valuation of as much as $20 billion, according to one person familiar with the company\u2019s plans.  The IPO comes as China-U.S. trade tensions involving tit-for-tat tariffs have knocked back global stock markets.  NIO, backed by Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd 0700.HK, plans to use the IPO proceeds for research and development of products and technology, marketing and developing manufacturing facilities.  Its other backers include investment firms Hillhouse Capital Group, Sequoia Capital and a private equity fund established by Baidu Inc BIDU.O.  NIO incurred a net loss of $502.6 million in the first six months of 2018 on $6.95 million in revenues. In June, it began customer deliveries of its ES8 pure-electric, seven-seat sport-utility vehicle, which the company sees as a rival to Tesla\u2019s Model X.  NIO said in its listing prospectus that as of the end of August, it had delivered about 1,600 ES8s and had another 15,778 unfulfilled reservations for the vehicle.  It also plans to launch a second, lower-priced electric sport-utility vehicle, the ES6, by the end of this year.  Start-up electric carmakers such as WM Motor Technology Co and Xpeng Motors have also raised billions of dollars from heavyweight investors including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA.N, Baidu and Tencent.  Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley led NIO\u2019s IPO. Also involved were Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and UBS.","531":"April 10 (Reuters) -  * TESLA HAS FURLOUGHED AROUND HALF OF ITS U.S. SALES AND DELIVERY EMPLOYEES THIS WEEK - CNBC, CITING COMPANY INSIDERS Source: cnb.cx\/3ccUWSf Further company coverage:","532":"STOCKHOLM, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Volvo Cars\u2019 luxury performance brand Polestar unveiled online its first fully electric sedan on Wednesday, with a price and driving range to rival Tesla\u2019s mass market Model 3.  The Polestar 2 will cost about 59,900 euros ($68,100) for its launch edition and can be driven for around 275 miles before it needs recharging - broadly in line with the Model 3\u2019s current price in Europe of 58,800 euros and 260 miles range.  The Model 3 and Polestar 2 are cheaper than most of the electric models launched by traditional premium carmakers so far, as Tesla and Polestar bet mass market customers are on the verge of adopting battery technology. Both have also promised even lower prices later on.  Polestar\u2019s launch comes as Tesla is trying to ramp up Model 3 sales in Europe and China, where recent government subsidies and programmes are boosting the take up of electric vehicles. A cut in subsidies in the United States, in contrast, in dampening demand in the Californian start-up\u2019s home market.  Tesla was dealt a setback this month after influential U.S. magazine Consumer Reports withdrew its endorsement for the Model 3, citing reliability problems. Analysts say Polestar has strong engineering as it is built on the Volvo platform.  Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath told Reuters he hoped to sell \u201cnorth of\u201d 50,000 Polestar 2s in the 2-3 years after deliveries start from the first half of 2020, but said how much production capacity the company sets up would depend on market conditions.  \u201cIf the market develops fine, I don\u2019t think the production volume will be the limitation. It depends much more on how the car resonates with the market, how the market develops and how the tariffs develops,\u201d he said.  Carmakers including Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW are beginning deliveries of premium electric cars unveiled over the past year as they try to muscle in on a market that Tesla has dominated so far.  Securing the electric market has become increasingly important as demand for traditional combustion engine vehicles slows in China and Europe, partly due to tariffs stemming from Washington\u2019s trade war with Beijing.  Although electric carmakers have also been affected, with Tesla having adjusted Model 3 prices in China after tariffs, Ingenlath said he expected electric sales to be supported by government subsidies and as the market grows from a low base.  Electric vehicle sales forecasts support this view. tmsnrt.rs\/2PuORFo  Polestar 2 is the first of five fully electric vehicles that Volvo Cars, owned by China\u2019s Geely, has promised.  The car will be available for online order initially in China, the United States and Canada as well as six European launch markets, and Ingenlath said he expected the three continents to each account for roughly a third of sales.  Volvo, which owns half of Polestar with the rest held by its parent Geely, said earlier this year it was talking to investors about raising funds to support Polestar\u2019s electrification costs. Ingenlath said it was too early to give an update on how that was progressing.

The company had earlier said it chose a location near Berlin for a new design centre and plant to make batteries, powertrains and vehicles, offering a major boost to the German capital.  Berlin\u2019s minister in charge of economic affairs, Ramona Pop, said the move could create 6,000 to 7,000 jobs in production alone, with hundreds or even thousands more in areas such as design, software or research.  \u201cBrexit (uncertainty) made it too risky to put a Gigafactory in the UK,\u201d Musk told industry website Auto Express.

Tesla shares jumped as much as 6.9 percent in morning trade, recouping a third of its losses from a week dominated by bad news about its credit rating and a crash involving a car using its semi-autonomous driving technology.  But with the company again missing its own 2,500 target for weekly production at the end of the first quarter, doubts remained among analysts and fund managers about Tesla\u2019s ability to keep production growing to a promised 5,000 Model 3s per week in three months time.  Musk\u2019s $50-billion dollar company, involved in a raft of projects ranging from trucks to a Roadster sports car and a factory in China, said it would also churn out 2,000 of the Model 3 cars next week and promised output would climb rapidly through the second quarter.  The Model 3 is the most affordable of Tesla\u2019s cars to date and is the only one capable of transforming the niche automaker into a mass producer amid a sea of rivals entering the nascent electric vehicle market.  \u201c(Tesla is) laying the groundwork for Q3 to have the long-sought ideal combination of high volume, good gross margin and strong positive operating cash flow,\u201d the company said in the filing.  \u201cAs a result, Tesla does not require an equity or debt raise this year, apart from standard credit lines.\u201d  Jefferies analysts had estimated that Tesla needed $2.5 billion to $3 billion of fresh equity to fund the Model 3 ramp-up and several other Wall Street brokerages have predicted the company would need more funds this year to fund its wide range of technology initiatives.  SKEPTICS  Some analysts said there were signs that the company might have prioritized the cheaper car, seen as crucial to its profitability, over its Model X SUV and more-established and expensive Model S sedan.  Last week, Barclays analyst Brian Johnson warned investors to be wary of a brief \u201cburst rate\u201d of Model 3 production that was not sustainable.  \u201cTesla may have stockpiled batteries amid Fremont downtime, allowing production to be higher in the final week of 1Q,\u201d Johnson wrote. \u201cAny such \u2018beat\u2019 is unlikely to be sustainable, and questions remain on Tesla\u2019s ability to sustainably reach 2,500\/week, let alone 5k\/week.\u201d  First-quarter deliveries totaled 29,980 vehicles, out of which 11,730 were Model S and 10,070 were Model X.

While Tesla had promised to reach 2,500 cars per week in the first quarter which ended March 31, the Model 3 weekly numbers it gave were for the seven days to April 2. Tesla declined to give production figures for the week to March 31.  Tesla shares peaked at $389 last September and have been declining steadily since, but analysts continue to give the company the benefit of the doubt as a big bet on the future of high-tech electric and self-driving vehicles.  Meanwhile, investors raised their bets against Tesla shares by 10 percent since mid-March, according to data provided by S3 Partners LLC on Tuesday, betting the market has misjudged the electric car maker\u2019s prospects.

The outgoing chief executive of Twenty-First Century Fox is the leading candidate to oversee Elon Musk, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday. He\u2019d be a better pick than any of the $44 billion electric-car maker\u2019s other directors. But Musk\u2019s tweet denying the story is a reminder that Tesla and its investors need a strong outsider to keep the boss under control.  Replacing Musk with an independent chair is required as part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which alleged Musk made false and misleading statements via Twitter about a potential buyout of the company.  Murdoch is one of only three Tesla directors who safely qualify as independent. The others have too much history with Musk. Murdoch also has experience as an executive at big public companies like Twenty-First Century Fox. True, he worked alongside his tycoon father, Rupert - but at least he knows how to deal with an entrenched shareholder-executive. Murdoch has no background in cars. though. And he had to step down as executive chairman of News International in 2011 after a phone-hacking scandal.  Moreover, Musk\u2019s latest micro-missive reinforces how neither Murdoch nor the rest of the board has proved able to rein him in. Publicly commenting on the chairman search gives the impression that the chief executive is playing a central role, when he should have little to no say in it. Another part of the SEC deal requires the board to set up \u201cadditional controls and procedures to oversee Musk\u2019s communications.\u201d  To date, directors have either supported Musk \u2013 as they did after he rejected the initial settlement offered by the SEC \u2013 or remained silent about controversial remarks. They haven\u2019t obviously curbed the CEO\u2019s penchant for going public with unrealistic business targets, either.  That all makes appointing a respected outsider a better option than Murdoch. That could be former Ford Motor boss Alan Mulally, erstwhile Boeing CEO Jim McNerney or even a hard-nosed finance type like Goldman Sachs and White House alum Gary Cohn.

The move comes as states and cities around the United States experiment with ways to safely reopen their economies after the coronavirus outbreak shuttered businesses and forced tens of millions of Americans out of work.  Musk over the weekend threatened to leave California for Texas or Nevada over his factory\u2019s closure. His move has highlighted the competition for jobs and ignited a rush to woo the billionaire executive by states that have reopened their economies more quickly in response to encouragement from U.S. President Donald Trump.  In an email on Monday, Tesla referred to an order on Thursday by California\u2019s governor allowing manufacturers to resume operations and said that as of Sunday, previously furloughed employees were back to their regular employment status.  \u201cWe\u2019re happy to get back to work and have implemented very detailed plans to help you keep safe as you return,\u201d according to the email seen by Reuters and titled \u201cFurlough Has Ended And We Are Back To Work in Production!\u201d  Musk in a tweet said production was resuming on Monday, adding that he would join workers on the assembly line. \u201cIf anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me,\u201d he wrote.  Health officials in Alameda County, where the Fremont factory is based, late on Monday said they were aware that Tesla had opened beyond the so-called minimum basic operations allowed during lockdown, and had notified the company it could not operate without a county-approved plan.  Slideshow ( 11 images )  In a statement, officials said they expected a proposal from Tesla later on Monday and \u201chope Tesla will likewise comply without further enforcement measures.\u201d The statement did not specify consequences and said officials would not comment further.  The county\u2019s lockdown order says violations are punishable by fine, imprisonment or both.  A spokeswoman for the Fremont Police Department on Monday said her office was enforcing the lockdown order at the direction of the health department and had been advised that the county is working with Tesla directly.  Separately on Monday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said California should do whatever is necessary to help the electric carmaker reopen its only U.S. vehicle factory if it wants to keep the company in its state.  California Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday said he spoke to Musk several days ago and that the Tesla founder\u2019s concerns helped prompt the state to begin its phased reopening of manufacturing last week.  \u201cI have not only known that company but I have known its founder for many, many years,\u201d Newsom said in his daily coronavirus press briefing. \u201cI have great reverence for their technology, for their innovative spirit, for their leadership.\u201d  Slideshow ( 11 images )  Tesla, which also has a vehicle plant in Shanghai and is building another in Berlin, on Saturday sued the county, alleging it had violated California\u2019s constitution by defying Newsom\u2019s orders allowing manufacturers to reopen.  Musk has discussed opening a second U.S. factory outside California in the past. In a tweet in February, he solicited comments on potentially opening a factory in Texas.  Since his threat to leave California on Saturday, officials from Texas, Georgia, Utah, Oklahoma and Nevada have reached out to Musk on Twitter, encouraging him to relocate to their state.

The legal complaint on behalf of 14 families from Congo was filed on Sunday by International Rights Advocates, a U.S.-based human rights non-profit, against Tesla Inc, Apple Inc, Alphabet Inc, Microsoft Corp and Dell Technologies Inc..  The companies were part of a system of forced labor that the families claimed led to the death and serious injury of their children, it said.  It marked the first time the tech industry jointly has faced legal action over the source of its cobalt.  Images in the court documents, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington D.C., showed children with disfigured or missing limbs.  Six of the 14 children in the case were killed in tunnel collapses, and the others suffered life-altering injuries, including paralysis, it said.  \u201cThese companies - the richest companies in the world, these fancy gadget-making companies - have allowed children to be maimed and killed to get their cheap cobalt,\u201d Terrence Collingsworth, an attorney representing the families, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Cobalt is essential in making rechargeable lithium batteries used in millions of products sold by the tech industry.  More than half of the world\u2019s cobalt is produced in Congo.  Global demand for the metal is expected to increase at 7% to 13% annually over the next decade, according to a 2018 study by the European Commission.  In response to a request for comment, Dell said in an email that it has \u201cnever knowingly sourced operations\u201d using child labor and has launched an investigation into the allegations.  Tesla, Apple, Google, Microsoft and Glencore did not immediately respond for comment.  The lawsuit said the children, some as young as 6 years old, were forced by their families\u2019 extreme poverty to leave school and work in cobalt mining owned by the British mining company Glencore. Glencore has previously been accused of using child labor.  Some children were paid as little as $1.50 per day, working 6 days a week, it said.  \u201cStarve or go risk your life to try to eat. Those are the choices for these people,\u201d said Collingsworth.  The legal complaint argued that the companies all have the ability to overhaul their cobalt supply chains to ensure safer conditions.  \u201cI\u2019ve never encountered or documented a more severe asymmetry in the allocation of income between the top of the supply chain and the bottom,\u201d said Siddharth Kara, a researcher on modern slavery who is an expert witness in the case.  \u201cIt\u2019s that disconnect that makes this perhaps the worst injustice of slavery and child exploitation that I\u2019ve seen in my two decades research,\u201d Kara said.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  LONDON (Reuters) - Tesla\u2019s shift to a magnetic motor using neodymium in its Model 3 Long Range car adds to pressure on already strained supplies of a rare earth metal that had for years been shunned because of an export ban by top producer China.  Efforts by governments around the world to cut noxious emissions produced by fossil fuel-powered cars is driving demand for electric vehicles and the metals used to make them, such as lithium and cobalt which are key ingredients for batteries.  Now the spotlight is on neodymium. Several auto makers already use permanent magnet motors that rely on the metal because they are generally lighter, stronger and more efficient than induction motors that are based on copper coils.  But it is the switch to neodymium by Tesla, an auto maker that has staked its future solely on the electric vehicle, that is showing the way the industry is moving and the direction of demand for the rare earth metal.  Research group imarc estimates the market for the neodymium-iron-boron magnet used in the motors is now worth more than $11.3 billion, with demand for the magnets rising at a compound annual growth rate of 8.5 percent between 2010 and 2017.(For a graphic on Neodymium market balance click reut.rs\/2FD6bUb)  \u201cSome electric car motors use the permanent magnet technology, probably the most famous is the Tesla Model 3 Long Range. All the other Tesla models -- Model X and Model 3 standard -- use induction motors,\u201d said David Merriman, a senior analyst at metals consultancy Roskill.  Global demand of 31,700 tonnes for neodymium last year already outstripped supply by 3,300 tonnes, he said. Demand was expected to climb to 34,200 tonnes this year and 38,800 tonnes in 2019, leaving larger deficits.  \u201cTesla\u2019s decision to switch to permanent magnets has completely changed the dynamics of the market,\u201d said a source at a fund manager that specializes in metals.  The price of neodymium is now about $70 a kg, well below the $500 hit after China held back shipments to Japan in 2010 during a row over disputed islands but it is still 40 percent higher than at the start of 2017.(For a graphic on neodymium prices click reut.rs\/2DlOHtE)  China, which resumed neodymium exports in 2015, imposed strict export quotas across a range of rare earth metal in 2010, saying it wanted to curtail pollution and preserve resources.  COSTLY PROCESS  \u201cPeople seem to have forgotten China\u2019s export ban. It could happen again. China is really the main producer, no one else has invested as much in rare earths,\u201d a rare earth trader said.  Despite their name, rare earths are found in many places around the world, but the process of extraction is difficult and expensive, as it requires separating multiple different metals from a single deposit. This is unlike the much simpler process, for example, of recovering copper from ore.(For a graphic on Rare Earth Producers click reut.rs\/2Fu5HnE)  China has invested heavily in the rare earth metals process but its crackdown on mining, smelting and other polluting industries is forecast to slow supply. It already helped push the neodymium price to a two-year high of $96 in September.  \u201cRare earth production is as bad as you can get in terms of environmental damage,\u201d the trader said. \u201cChina used its dominant position before, what\u2019s to stop it doing so again?\u201d  Such supply concerns are encouraging automakers to search for ways of cutting down neodymium use. Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said last month it had found a way to cut use of the metal in electric motors by about a fifth.  The Japanese firm said it had developed a magnet which replaced some of the neodymium with more abundant and cheaper rare earths -- lanthanum and cerium. Toyota aims to use the magnets in electric vehicle motors within the next 10 years.  Other manufacturers of electric vehicles that use permanent magnets include BMW BMWG, Nissan 7201.T and Geely 0175.HK.  Several companies produce rare earth metals outside China, including London-listed Rainbow Rare Earths RBWR.L and Canada-listed Namibia Rare Earths NRE.V.  But, for now, auto makers making permanent magnet motors remain heavily reliant on China, which according to Roskill accounted for 85 percent of global output of rare earth oxide estimated at 161,700 tonnes in 2017.  Morgan Stanley analysts estimate electric vehicles will total 50,000 units in 2020 or 2.3 percent of the total, rising to 400,000 in 2025 or 17.4 percent, and 975,000 in 2030 or 40.9 percent.","548":"Oct 5 (Reuters) - Shares of Tesla Inc fell as much as 4 percent on Friday, after Chief Executive Elon Musk stirred nerves about the settlement of his securities fraud lawsuit by mocking the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Twitter.

China Construction Bank 0939.HK601939.SS (CCB), Agricultural Bank of China 1288.HK601288.SS (AgBank), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China 601398.SS1398.HK (ICBC) and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank 600000.SS (SPDB) are among the banks which have agreed to give Tesla the financial support, one source with direct knowledge said.  The Chinese banks earlier this year already offered Tesla a 12-month facility of up to 3.5 billion yuan, which is due to be repaid on March 4, 2020, according to a filing the automaker made to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  That new loan will be partially used to roll over the previous 3.5 billion yuan debt, according to the first source. The second source said the rest will be used on the factory and Tesla\u2019s China operations.  The new loan\u2019s interest rate will be pegged at 90% of China\u2019s one-year benchmark interest rate, the same as the 3.5 billion yuan loan, the first source said. This is a rate that China banks offer to their best clients.  Tesla, CCB, AgBank, ICBC and SPDB did not immediately respond to Reuters\u2019 requests for comment.  Tesla broke ground on the factory in January and has started producing vehicles from its Shanghai plant. It aims to build at least 1,000 Model 3 cars a week by the end of this year.

It ties the crypto asset class to a nearly trillion dollar and highly visible company that we are confident put substantial resources into vetting the decision and structure (and after its analysis, was confident moving forward). We also believe this will spark other companies (private and public) to explore Tesla\u2019s decision and determine whether they should look to do something similar.

The two posts on the Tesla human resources department\u2019s official WeChat account mark the first time the California-based automaker has looked to hire for such roles in China.  Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Its billionaire chief executive Elon Musk said on Twitter last month the firm would \u201csoon\u201d announce timings for solar projects in China and Europe, without providing more details.  One post says Tesla is seeking project managers to design and execute solar projects for commercial or residential customers, while a second seeks managers to develop photovoltaic energy storage projects.  The roles are advertised as based at its $2 billion factory in Shanghai, which started delivering China-made Model 3 electric sedans at the end of last year.  Tesla moved into the solar business in 2016 with its $2.6 billion purchase of California-based SolarCity, and has said it is keen to develop its energy business.  Its solar services include Solar Roof, a power generating system meant to look like normal roof tiles, and Powerwall, which can store power generated by solar panels.

Tesla fans cheered the signs of a manufacturing jump while business analysts said the company needed to fulfill the spirit of the settlement by appointing a strong independent chair and new directors.  The electric carmaker\u2019s shares sank last week after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Musk of securities fraud and sought to ban him from company leadership, pointing to a long drawn-out fight that could have undermined Tesla\u2019s operations and ability to raise capital.  Instead, under a settlement announced at the weekend, Tesla and Musk will pay $20 million each to the regulator and Musk will step down as chairman but stay as CEO, keeping one of America\u2019s best-known corporate figures in place.  In a sign of the manufacturing process improving, Musk in an email to employees on Saturday said the company was \u201cvery close to achieving profitability\u201d. He added, \u201cTo be certain, we must execute really well tomorrow.\u201d Sunday was the last day of the quarter.  Automotive news website Electrek reported here on Monday that Tesla had produced 53,000 of its Model 3 sedans in the third quarter, up from 28,578 in the previous three months and making good on a promise in August it would produce 50,000 to 55,000 of the cars. It produced about 80,000 vehicles overall, the site said.  Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Relief at the settling of the lawsuit drove the biggest one-day gain in Tesla shares in more than five years.  \u201cThe stock was down so much on Friday because it was unclear if he would remain with the company at all given what the SEC was pushing for,\u201d said Garrett Nelson from CFRA Research.

As part of the settlement with the SEC, Tesla will also appoint an independent chairman and two independent directors, responding to calls on Wall Street to relieve the pressure on Musk and provide more balance in the carmaker\u2019s management.  \u201cThis is one of the best cases for appointing an independent chair we have seen in a while,\u201d said Courteney Keatinge, research director for proxy adviser Glass, Lewis & Co.  \u201cHis behavior hasn\u2019t been great for a while. And I think this kind of behavior has a ripple effect, when there isn\u2019t steady leadership at the top.\u201d  Lawyers said the settlement and size of the fine might give more ammunition to short-sellers pursuing separate cases against Musk for manipulating company shares through the Aug. 7 tweet, as well as to a probe by the Justice Department.  But several experienced litigators also said that, while the DOJ probe is separate, the SEC\u2019s settlement might mark the end of official action against Tesla and Musk.  \u201cThe standard of proof for any potential criminal charge is higher than that of a civil case, which the SEC had,\u201d said Jay Dubow, a former branch chief in the SEC\u2019s enforcement division.  \u201cIt is possible that the DOJ investigation does not result in any criminal charges at least in part because the DOJ could determine that the SEC\u2019s action resolved the matter and that no further governmental action is required.\u201d  Neither Musk nor Tesla admitted or denied the SEC\u2019s findings under the settlement, which still must be approved by a court.","556":"PORTLAND, Ore.\/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Daimler AG DAIGn.DE unveiled on Wednesday an all-electric big rig truck it promises to have in production in 2021, as the German automaker mounts a major challenge to European and American rivals, including new entrants like Tesla Inc TSLA.O.  President and CEO of Daimler Trucks North America Roger Nielsen unveils the all-electric eCascadia big rig truck at an event at Portland International Raceway, in Portland, Oregon, U.S., June 6, 2018. REUTERS\/Eric Johnson  Truck buyers anticipate global regulation to curb pollution from trucks and see advantages from lower fuel and maintenance costs of electric vehicles, but a fleet technology switch is far from certain given challenges of cost, charging infrastructure, range, and the potential for heavy batteries to constrict payloads.  Daimler\u2019s Freightliner eCascadia is an 18-wheeler with a 250-mile (400 km) range, aimed for regional distribution and port services, while Tesla has said that its Semi - which it expects to build by 2020 - will be suited to longer-distance runs with a 500-mile range.  Daimler on Wednesday also unveiled a medium-duty Freightliner eM2 106, with a range of up to 230 miles, designed for local distribution, such as beverage delivery, which some analysts see as the \u201csweet spot\u201d of the emerging electric truck market.  Daimler said it will deliver a total of 30 prototypes on the two models to customers later this year for field-testing and expects to have the trucks in production in 2021.  Daimler, as the world\u2019s largest truck maker, has much to lose as competition for electrified trucks intensifies.  The company's Illinois-based rival, Navistar International Corp NAV.N, and its partner Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, which is spending $1.7 billion on electric drives, autonomous vehicles and cloud-based systems by 2022, aim to launch their own medium-duty truck in North America by late 2019.  Daimler, with a $66.4 billion market capitalization and best-known for its luxury Mercedes-Benz brand, has a 40 percent share of the roughly $39 billion North American heavy-duty truck market.  Local delivery \u201cmakes an enormous amount of sense because it doesn\u2019t have the long-range requirements, yet puts on enough miles on a daily basis where you can get fuel savings,\u201d said Tim Denoyer, a senior analyst at consultancy ACT Research.  CRUCIAL BATTERIES  Success for the larger class 8 trucks would hinge on lowering battery costs: \u201cWhile electric truck sales will be fairly significant in coming years, I don\u2019t think it will displace diesel anytime soon especially in highway, long-haul trucking where obviously battery capacity and range anxiety present itself,\u201d Denoyer said.  The company will use batteries from German firm Akasol, a spokesman for Daimler told Reuters. No final sourcing decisions on batteries have been made, however, he said.  Akasol buys lithium cells and adapts them to battery systems used by bus makers Daimler and Volvo among others as well as in industrial vehicles, locomotives and ships. Reuters reported earlier this week, citing sources, that Akasol is preparing for a Frankfurt stock market listing before the summer break.  Daimler Trucks North America Chief Executive Officer Roger Nielsen said the truck\u2019s payload had been curbed by the size of batteries.  \u201cOverall, this is an ideal application for customers whose routes have a distinct radius and whose operating model provides time for battery recharge,\u201d he said.  A heavy-duty commercial truck runs up to 100,000 miles a year, and Tesla has promised a 20-percent saving on current per-mile operating costs, to some skepticism.  Tesla also has more than 450 reservations for its truck and expects to have a head start, although its plans are still developing and the roll-out of its Model 3 sedan has been plagued by production problems. CEO Elon Musk plans to start production in 2020 but there is no Tesla truck factory yet.  Martin Daum, head of Daimler\u2019s trucks and buses divisions, took a jab at Tesla when asked during an interview with Reuters whether Daimler would start accepting truck reservations with cash down payments, as Tesla does to raise funds.  \u201cWe don\u2019t need the down payments to finance our investments,\u201d Daum said after flashing a smile. \u201cWe give (customers) prototypes. We don\u2019t charge for that. It\u2019s gaining knowledge on their side, as well as on our side. Then we sell the trucks and then we deliver the trucks. We don\u2019t need any pre-orders.\u201d  Daimler also announced a new research and development center for autonomous driving in Portland, which will work with existing facilities in Stuttgart, Germany, and Bangalore, India on getting self-driving freight trucks on the road.  Stuttgart-based Daimler will invest more than 2.5 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in R&D at its truck operations by 2019, with more than 500 million euros earmarked for electric heavy-duty commercial vehicles, connectivity and self-driving technology.  Daimler Trucks expects a strong second half of the year but second-quarter business remains challenging, finance chief Jochen Goetz said, citing problems in the supply chain. He also said the truckmaker would focus on executing its previous savings plan and aim to lower costs by 1.4 billion euros as planned by 2019.","557":"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The head of the Berlin engine plant run by Mercedes-Benz has defected to rival Tesla TSLA.O, German union IG Metall said on Wednesday, calling on employees to protest over his departure.

Last month, a source told Reuters that a Tesla manager who oversaw the construction of the electric carmaker\u2019s Gruenheide plant, had left his position.  Daimler said on Wednesday that Reif, 57, the manager of its Mercedes-Benz Berlin plant, which makes powertrains, would go into early retirement at the end of the year, at his own request.  German unions have lamented the fact that traditional carmakers are cutting investment into combustion engine technologies as regulators clamp down on emissions and as demand for vehicles is hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.  IG Metall said there would be a protest in front of the Mercedes factory on Thursday and called on Daimler to present solutions that would help to guarantee the future of the plant.  The union said Daimler managers had outlined cost savings plans and union officials fear the Berlin plant\u2019s future is at risk.  Daimler said Clemenz Dobrawa, who currently heads up the Mercedes-Benz battery manufacturing plant in Kamenz, had taken over leadership of the Mercedes-Benz plants in Hamburg and Berlin earlier this month.  \u201cThanks to his activity as representative in Kamenz, he brings important know-how for the transformation toward electromobility,\u201d Daimler said, adding the Berlin plant would be restructured to serve an \u2018Electric First\u2019 strategy.","558":"Breakingviews  Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Ganfeng, which supplies lithium used in rechargeable batteries to electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla TSLA.O, had flagged last month that it expected a sharp decline in first-half earnings. On Wednesday, it said its net income totaled 295.8 million yuan ($41.70 million) for January to June, versus a restated figure of 725.3 million yuan a year earlier.  Revenues rose 21% to 2.82 billion yuan thanks to bigger sales volumes, Jiangxi-based Ganfeng said, but slumping lithium prices meant the company was unable to cash in.  Prices of lithium carbonate, a chemical used in EV batteries, have dropped nearly 20% this year to around $9.25 per kg amid an \u201cavalanche\u201d of supply, consultancy CRU said last week.  Last week Ganfeng's rival Tianqi Lithium 002466.SZ reported an 85% plunge in net profits for the first half.  Still, Ganfeng said abundant supply and falling prices of spodumene, a mineral mined for its lithium content, \u201ccan greatly reduce raw material costs\u201d for the company, which converts the spodumene into lithium chemicals, and \u201cbuffer the impact\u201d of low lithium prices.  Ganfeng has interests in mines in Australia, Argentina and Canada and around 70,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent of annual conversion capacity in China.  It said last month that it expected first-half profits to fall by 45-65%, saying it would record losses of 119.14 million yuan from changes in fair value as a result of fluctuations in shares it holds.  In the second quarter alone, Ganfeng\u2019s net profit totaled 43.1 million yuan, according to Reuters calculations. That marks Ganfeng\u2019s worst quarterly result since the fourth quarter of 2016, when it made a 21.4 million yuan loss, Refinitiv Eikon data shows.","560":"DETROIT (Reuters) - Tesla Inc and Wall Street made 2020 the year that the U.S. auto industry decided to go electric.  FILE PHOTO: Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk speaks onstage during a delivery event for Tesla China-made Model 3 cars at its factory in Shanghai, China January 7, 2020. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  Tesla\u2019s market capitalization surged above $600 billion, making the once wobbly startup founded by billionaire Elon Musk worth more than the five top-selling global vehicle making groups combined. The exclamation point came on Friday when Tesla rose to a record high in frantic trading ahead of the stock\u2019s much anticipated entrance into the benchmark S&P 500 index..  For 2021, all signs point toward the industry accelerating its shift toward electrification, a turning point as historically momentous as the launch of Ford Motor Co\u2019s moving assembly line for the Model T or General Motors \u2019 2009 bankruptcy.  Tesla\u2019s ascent came the same year that activist hedge funds and other investors ratcheted up pressure on corporations to fight climate change. Evidence is growing that more investors have concluded the century-long dominance of internal combustion engines - \u201cICE\u201d in industry slang - is headed toward a close within a decade.  From London to Beijing to California, political leaders also embraced plans to start phasing out internal combustion engine-only vehicles as early as 2030. Pressure to cut greenhouse gas emissions undermines the logic for significant new investments in ICE engines. Thousands of manufacturing jobs are currently tied to internal combustion in the United States, Britain, Germany, France, Japan and other countries.  Other powerful forces also shook the auto industry\u2019s status quo this year. The COVID-19 pandemic stripped away the sales and profits that incumbent automakers had counted on to fund methodical transitions to electric vehicles. China\u2019s rapid recovery from the pandemic exerted an even more powerful gravitational pull on industry investment.  WILL CONSUMERS PLUG IN?  This was the year GM Chief Executive Mary Barra and other top industry executives began to echo Tesla\u2019s Musk, saying electric vehicle battery costs could soon achieve parity with internal combustion technology. Still, it remained to be seen whether consumers, particularly in the United States, are ready to say goodbye to petroleum-fueled pickup trucks and SUVs.  The best-selling vehicles in the United States remain large, petroleum-burning pickup trucks. Demand for these vehicles powered a recovery for Detroit automakers after the pandemic forced factories to shut down in the spring.  The best electric vehicle and battery makers could field models that match internal combustion upfront cost as soon as 2023, brokerage Bernstein wrote in a report.  \u201cICE game over with BEV ~ 2030,\u201d Bernstein\u2019s auto analysts wrote, using the industry\u2019s acronyms for internal combustion engine and Battery Electric Vehicle.  The shift toward electric vehicles is speeding a parallel transformation of vehicles into largely digital machines that get much of their value from software that powers rich visual displays and features such as automated driving systems.  Across the industry, century-old manufacturers such as Daimler AG are scrambling to hire programmers and artificial intelligence experts.  The capability of software to manage autonomous driving systems, electricity flows from batteries and data streaming to and from vehicles is replacing horsepower as a measure of automotive engineering achievement.  Tesla\u2019s use of smartphone-style over-the-air software upgrades was once a unique feature of the Silicon Valley brand. In 2020, the best-selling model line in the United States, the Ford F-150 pickup, was redesigned to offer over-the-air software updates, making the technology as mainstream as it gets.  THE PANDEMIC AND CHINA  In the best of times, traditional internal-combustion vehicles would have faced huge costs and disruptions to their workforces to evolve to electric, software-intensive vehicles. But the shock delivered by the coronavirus pandemic gave manufacturers much less money and time to adapt.  Consultancy IHS Markit forecasts that global vehicle production will not match 2019 levels again until 2023. Automakers will have produced 20 million fewer vehicles by 2023 than they could have built had output stayed at 2019 levels.  \u201cOnly the most agile with a Darwinian spirit will survive,\u201d said Carlos Tavares, the Peugeot SA chief who will lead the combined Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler when that merger is completed.  The pandemic also elevated the importance of China to the industry\u2019s future. That country\u2019s swift recovery from the pandemic amplified the gravitational pull of its huge market on automotive investment, despite anti-China rhetoric from U.S. and European politicians.  China\u2019s drive to reduce dependence on petroleum is compelling automakers to shift investment toward battery electric and hybrid vehicles, and re-center design and engineering activities to Chinese cities from traditional hubs in Nagoya, Wolfsburg and Detroit. Tesla said it will establish a design and research center in China.  Daimler AG Chief Executive Ola Kaellenius put it bluntly in October: \u201cWe need to look at our production footprint and where it makes sense, shift our production,\u201d he said during a video call. \u201cLast year we sold around 700,000 passenger cars in China. The next biggest market is the U.S. with between 320,000 and 330,000 cars.\u201d","561":"FILE PHOTO: The Tesla logo is seen on a car in Los Angeles, California, U.S., July 9, 2020.

The announcement comes nearly three years after Chief Executive Elon Musk promised the car at that price to appeal to the mass market. Tesla said its sales would now be online-only around the world and it would close many stores.  \u201cShifting all sales online, combined with other ongoing cost efficiencies, will enable us to lower all vehicle prices by about 6 percent on average, allowing us to achieve the $35,000 Model 3 price point earlier than we expected,\u201d Tesla said in a blog on its website.  This is the third time this year that Tesla has lowered the price on the Model 3, which recently started at $42,900. A U.S. federal tax credit began phasing out for Tesla in January, effectively raising the price of cars by $3,750.  The new $35,000 version has a top speed of 130 miles per hour (209 km per hour) and can go from zero to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds, Tesla said. For $2,000 more, Tesla offers a version with 240 miles (386 km) of range and a top speed of 140 mph.  A $35,000 Model 3 is a major shot in the arm for Tesla during a period of major challenges for the Silicon Valley company and could put to rest concerns among some analysts that demand for Tesla\u2019s vehicles might be constrained in 2019. Besides the Model 3, Tesla is developing a new Model Y SUV for 2020 production, while beginning to build a factory in Shanghai.  Tesla stunned the automotive world after its reservations list for the promised $35,000 Model 3 ballooned to over half a million orders in 2017. Tesla no longer discloses the number of reservations, but many analysts believe those on the list are still waiting for this cheaper version.  The news comes three days after renewed tensions between Musk and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The agency petitioned a judge this week to have Tesla\u2019s CEO found in contempt of an October settlement between the parties. The SEC accuses Musk of having made material statements about production levels on Twitter without first having them vetted internally.  That settlement between Musk, Tesla and the SEC concerned Musk\u2019s August Twitter post in which he claimed to have \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private at $420 per share. As part of the settlement, Musk stepped down from his chairmanship role and he and Tesla agreed to pay $20 million each in fines. On Friday, Tesla is due to repay a $920 million convertible bond. Convertible issues give bondholders the right to trade their debt for equity after shares rise over a certain price. Tesla shares are currently about $40 below the $359.87 conversion price.  Tesla had $3.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of December.","565":"SHANGHAI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - U.S. electric carmaker Tesla Inc said it will start taking orders in China on Friday for a lower-priced version of its Model 3 vehicle, whose price will start at 433,000 yuan ($64,300.56).

The development comes at the tail end of a Sino-U.S. trade war characterised by tit-for-tat tariffs on goods and services as varied as metals and cars, which bumped up prices of U.S. made goods in China.  It also comes after Tesla suspended production at its San Francisco Bay Area plant due to the broader impact of the coronavirus, with plans to resume normal operation on May 4.  Tesla said it aims to start delivering Shanghai-made Long Range Model 3 cars from June this year, priced 339,050 yuan after subsidies.  The rear-wheel drive variant, with a driving range of over 600 kilometres before needing to be recharged, differs from the imported version which was all-wheel drive and priced 439,900 yuan.  The locally made Performance Model 3, for which deliveries are slated for the first quarter next year, will be priced 419,800 yuan, the California-based automaker said without specifying the price after subsidies. Imported Performance Model 3 vehicles were priced 509,900 yuan.

Some of the industry\u2019s most prominent players are suffering heavy losses amid soured short bets.  David Einhorn\u2019s Greenlight Capital fund is down 19 percent, posting some of the industry\u2019s worst returns, as Tesla was the fund\u2019s second largest loser in the second quarter, the fund manager told investors in late July.  Musk has been in a vocal war with short sellers, needling prominent investors who bet against Tesla, which is one of the most heavily-shorted stocks. Musk on Tuesday tweeted that going private would end \u201cnegative propaganda from shorts.\u201d  The average long-short hedge fund is up just 0.7 percent for the year to date, according to Hedge Fund Research, while the average short-focused mutual fund or exchanged traded fund is down nearly 6 percent for the year, according to Lipper. The benchmark S&P 500 index by comparison is up 7 percent for the year.  \u201cThe major shorts have remained steadfast to their convictions,\u201d said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners.  Yet short-sellers say that rising interest rates may soon make betting against rising prices once again profitable as companies find it more expensive to borrow.  \u201cOne of the challenges we\u2019ve been facing is that some of the business models which are really bad in our opinion keep thriving because they get acquired or they can still get debt financing,\u201d said Bimal Shah, an associate portfolio manager of the Thornburg Long\/Short Equity fund.  Shah\u2019s fund has been increasing its short exposure as interest rates rise, he said, and has been adding to its bets in sectors including technology, healthcare and consumer discretionary companies.  \u201cWe are starting to see some really juicy shorting opportunities now,\u201d Shah said.  Overall, short interest - a measure of how many shares of a given company are held by short-sellers - has been increasing yearly since 2016, and is up 6.1 percent for the year so far, according to S3 Partners.  The total value of short interest topped $1 trillion for the first time on record this year, S3 Partners said, pushed higher in part by large short bets on companies including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd , Amazon.com Inc, and Apple Inc.  Brian Culpepper, a portfolio manager of the James Long-Short Fund, said that the breadth of gains in the stock market has made it difficult to find profitable shorts.  The U.S. tax cuts passed by Congress last December has helped earnings among S&P 500 index companies who have reported their second quarter results rise by an average of 24.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data, nearly double the 12.3 percent earnings growth rate during the same quarter last year.  The broad gains in the stock market will likely slow as the effects of the tax cut are more fully priced into the market, Culpepper said.  \u201cAs the stock market becomes more condensed into a few overall names, our percentage of shorts will increase,\u201d he said.

REUTERS\/Ralph Orlowski  The German automaker, the inventor of the modern car, is championing \u201cEinsitzkomfort\u201d - the sensation customers experience when they recline in one of the plush seats.  That\u2019s along with \u201cUebertragungsverhalten\u201d, or the seat\u2019s ability to absorb bumps in the road, and \u201cLangstreckenkomfort\u201d, or long-range comfort features, the vehicle\u2019s moustachioed chief engineer Juergen Weissinger told Reuters.  The growing lexicon of engineering features is a sign of Mercedes\u2019 determination to push the boundaries of automotive refinement as it tries to reclaim high-tech bragging rights that have been hijacked by electric car pioneer Tesla.  It has led the Lastenheft, or engineering blueprint, of the S-Class to expand from a pamphlet into a huge tome.  \u201cThe Lastenheft for this S-Class which was conceptualised in 2014 is now 689 pages long,\u201d Weissinger said at the Daimler-owned company\u2019s factory in Sindelfingen.  \u201cThat\u2019s a fivefold increase from 30 years ago.\u201d  Seats, and rear seats in particular, have emerged as a key battleground in the car industry, where the rise of automated driving has made the passenger experience as important as that of the driver.  Tesla has accelerated the pace of industry innovation by using remote software updates to introduce quirky features such as \u201cfart mode\u201d, which emits a farting sound over car speakers for the amusement - or not - of passengers.  Mercedes also wants to persuade drivers it has thought of everything.  \u201cThe essence of the S-Class is comfort and security in a luxury package,\u201d Weissinger said, explaining the seats have 19 internal motors - eight for adjustments, four for massage, five for ventilation, one for lumbar support and one to move a monitor attached to the backrest.  Seats also have embedded speakers, so customers can \u201cfeel\u201d sound.  Ten different massage programmes are available, including one that pulsates in time to music and a heated one that uses vibration motors and inflatable air chambers in the seat.  Four radial fans in the cushion, and two in the backrest, can also cool passengers down.  There are safety innovations too, including digital headlights that can fire warning beams at inattentive pedestrians or project lines ahead to help a driver steer between objects.  Navigation is aided by a three-dimensional augmented reality display, while a high-tech driver assistance system allows the car to drive in automated mode at up to 60 kilometres an hour.  This so-called Level 3 automation system will be introduced first in Germany in 2021, Mercedes said.  The new S-Class can be ordered in Germany from mid September, and will be in dealerships in December. Market launch in the United States and China will start in February 2021.","569":"FILE PHOTO: China-made Tesla Model 3 electric vehicles are seen at the Gigafactory of electric carmaker Tesla Inc in Shanghai, China December 2, 2019.

Tesla plans to increase prices of imported Model 3 vehicles with longer range and those with performance function, which are currently priced at 439,900 yuan ($62,495.56) and 509,900 yuan, respectively.  The move comes as Tesla, which is building a car plant in Shanghai, aims to deliver China-made Model 3 sedans, which are priced at 355,800 yuan, to customers before Jan. 25 next year.  It was unclear by how much Tesla plans to increase the China prices. The sources declined to be named as they are not authorized to speak to media.  Tesla declined to comment.  The electric vehicle maker began production in the Shanghai factory in October on a trial basis and aims to produce at least 1,000 Model 3 cars a week by the end of this year.  The plant\u2019s mass production schedule is crucial for Tesla\u2019s hopes of raising its annual production rate to 500,000 vehicles by the end of this year.  The $2 billion factory, Tesla\u2019s first car manufacturing site outside the United States, is the centerpiece of its ambitions to boost sales in the world\u2019s biggest auto market and avoid higher import tariffs imposed on U.S.-made cars.","570":"NEW YORK, June 12 (Reuters) - The surging share price for automaker Tesla Inc this month has slammed short-sellers of the stock with more than $2 billion in losses on paper so far in June, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners.  Tesla shares are up 20.5 percent in June, on pace for their biggest monthly gain month since August 2014, boosted by optimism the company can meet production targets for its Model 3 sedans.  The sharp gains have caught short-sellers in a tough spot, putting their mark-to-market losses for June to $2.09 billion, S3 data showed.  Short-sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares with the hope of buying them back later at a lower price.  \u201cIn all of 2017, they (short-sellers) were down $3.4 billion. To lose $2 billion in a month, stands out as one of the biggest losses for a stock that I have seen,\u201d said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 in New York.  With Tesla shares up about 2 percent in late afternoon trading on Tuesday, shorts were down $278 million in mark-to-market losses, in addition to $549 million in losses on Monday, said Dusaniwsky. That makes it the worst performing stock for short sellers this year, he said.  On Tuesday, Tesla shares rose as much as 6.9 percent to a 3-1\/2 month high of $354.97, before paring gains on news that the electric carmaker would cut 9 percent of its staff, or several thousand jobs, across the company as it seeks to reduce costs.  Tesla short interest stands at $12.6 billion, with 37.9 million or nearly 30 percent of the share float, sold short, according to S3 data.  Shares of heavily shorted companies can at times get pushed higher as traders rush to buy stock to cover their short bets, triggering what is known as a \u2018short squeeze.\u2019 That has not happened so far for Tesla, according to S3 data.  There has only been a small drop in the number of shares sold short in June.  \u201cWith almost 80 million shares traded in June this slight short covering did not move Tesla\u2019s stock price,\u201d said Dusaniwsky.  \u201cThis is the biggest cry wolf on Wall Street - everyone says short squeeze, and it never is.

FILE PHOTO: A charging plug is seen on an electric vehicle (EV) at the second media day for the Shanghai auto show in Shanghai, China April 17, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  New energy vehicle (NEVs) sales fell for a tenth straight month in April, plummeting 43% from a year earlier in a market that has now got 50-or-so established start-ups competing with domestic giants like Geely, state-owned FAW Group, and foreign marques like Tesla Inc and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE.  \u201cThe difficulties that EV start-ups have encountered, such as the auto sales decline, harsh fundraising environment and subsidies reduction, all started last year,\u201d said Brian Gu, president of Alibaba-backed Xpeng Motors.  \u201cThe outbreak will aggravate these issues that already had existed,\u201d said Gu, whose firm delivered 16,000 vehicles in 2019.  Despite subsidies to EV makers and tax breaks for buyers, industry watchers fear electric vehicles could become an even harder sell after the plunge in global oil prices, which has made the technology a less attractive bet for consumers and investors alike.  Even Buffett-backed long-established EV maker BYD reported 85% profit drop in the first quarter due to the slide in sales caused by coronavirus.  Still, Cui Dongshu, secretary general at China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), noted some of the leading EV startups managed \u201cokay\u201d sales in the first quarter, listing Nio Inc, Xpeng Motors and Li Auto as examples.  But the downswing does not bode well for China\u2019s chances of hitting a target for NEVs - a category that includes plug-in hybrids, battery-only electric vehicles and vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells - to account for 25% of all automobile sales by 2025 compared with the current 5%.  CUTTING COSTS, SEARCHING FOR FUNDING  An investor in WM Motor, which sold nearly 17,000 vehicles last year, expected EV makers still producing on a smaller scale to fall by the wayside during this contraction in the market.  \u201cThose who had not launched mass production of their car models by 2019 would probably die. The outbreak is going to accelerate their death,\u201d the investor, who requested anonymity, said.  WM Motor, backed by Baidu Inc, said it had cancelled performance bonuses due to failure to meet 2019 targets and delayed payments of annual bonuses and employee subsidies due to the economic challenges arising from the coronavirus epidemic.  Some smaller EV makers have resorted to salary cuts and lay-offs, according to employees.  Volatile financial markets have made it harder for firms to drum up funding from share issues. During the first quarter, China\u2019s EV makers only secured $200 million of new funding, according to PitchBook data.  Gu declined to comment on plans for an IPO by Xpeng, which launched P7 sedan models on April 27 and plans to export G3 sport-utility vehicles to Norway.  \u201cOnly the top-tier EV makers will be able to attract attention from investors in this environment,\u201d said Gu, adding that Xpeng kept an open mind for diversified sources of capital.  Li Auto, also known as CHJ Automotive, has filed for a U.S. initial public offering, aiming to raise at least $500 million, sources told Reuters in January. And its founder has since said the firm has sufficient cash reserves to weather the impact from virus.  Other firms have turned to the state for funding.  Nio, a trailblazer among these start-ups, set up a new entity, Nio China, which secured a 7 billion yuan ($986.78 million) investment from state-controlled investors.  Luchi Motor, one of China\u2019s earliest EV startups, sold a controlling stake to the investment company of Henan province in March, after it failed to deliver cars as scheduled.","574":"(Reuters) - Shares of Tesla Inc fell over 3.5 percent on Monday after Chief Executive Elon Musk directed abuse on Twitter at one of the British cavers involved in the rescue of 12 Thai children last week.  A number of analysts and investors, requesting anonymity, told Reuters that Musk\u2019s comments were adding to their concerns that his public statements were distracting him from Tesla\u2019s main business of producing electric cars. The stock sell-off knocked almost $2 billion off the company\u2019s market value.  Tesla shares were at $307.20 in after-hours trading on Monday from Friday\u2019s close of $318.87.  James Anderson, a partner at Tesla\u2019s fourth-largest shareholder, asset manager Baillie Gifford, called the weekend\u2019s events \u201ca regrettable instance\u201d and said he had reiterated to the company the need for \u201cpeace and execution\u201d of its core business.  The billionaire entrepreneur\u2019s spat with British caver Vernon Unsworth started last week, after rescue teams rejected Musk\u2019s offer of a mini-submarine created by his rocket company SpaceX to help rescue a 12-member soccer team and their coach trapped inside a flooded cave in the northern province of Chiang Rai.  \u201cHe can stick his submarine where it hurts,\u201d CNN quoted Unsworth as saying last week. \u201cIt just has absolutely no chance of working.\u201d  Musk shot back on Sunday on Twitter: \u201cWe will make one (video) of the mini-sub\/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problemo.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Tesla spokespeople and lawyers did not respond to emails and phone calls from Reuters requesting comment on Musk\u2019s comments on Twitter.  Musk gave no evidence for alleging Unsworth was a pedophile. Unsworth said he would consider taking legal action against Musk over the remarks, in comments filmed in Chiang Rai on Monday by Australia\u2019s 9News.  \u201cIt\u2019s not finished. No justification. At the end of the day we were here to rescue 12 young boys. I don\u2019t really understand the guy. Obviously it\u2019s a bruised ego. I\u2019ll take advice when I get back to London,\u201d Unsworth told 9News.  Reuters could not immediately reach Unsworth for comment.  His wife, Voranan Rattawipakhun, told Reuters on Monday that her husband would return to Britain on July 19, where he will speak to lawyers.  A police officer in the Chiang Rai district where Unsworth has lived for seven years, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said that no charges or complaints had ever been filed against Unsworth.  In a Tweet, Musk had proposed \u201ca tiny kid sized submarine\u201d for the rescue. He showed a test of the submarine in a Los Angeles swimming pool on July 9.  Last week, Narongsak Osottanakorn, the leader of the rescue operation in Thailand, rejected Musk\u2019s mini-submarine as not suitable for the task. Musk responded on Twitter on July 10, calling Osottanakorn \u201cnot the subject matter expert.\u201d  Musk also regularly uses Twitter to criticize media reports on Tesla, which has struggled to meet its own production targets for its Model 3 sedan, which is seen as key to the company\u2019s profitability.","575":"July 22 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Wednesday beat analysts\u2019 estimates for second-quarter revenue, helped by better-than-expected vehicle deliveries despite disruptions caused by the coronavirus crisis.

REUTERS\/Bobby Yip  NEW YORK\/WASHINGTON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tesla shareholders may soon find out what their company is really worth. The Securities and Exchange Commission is pushing to have Elon Musk removed as both chief executive and board member at the $53 billion electric-car maker, accusing him in a lawsuit on Thursday of making \u201cfalse and misleading statements\u201d about a plan to take it private. Tesla would be depleted without Musk, but also more rationally valued.  The insight the SEC sheds into Tesla\u2019s inner workings would be funny if there weren\u2019t so much money at stake. An example: Musk picked the $420 price at which he planned to buy Tesla shares, the filing suggests, partly because he thought his girlfriend \u201cwould find it funny\u201d \u2013 that number being slang for smoking cannabis. Musk\u2019s cavalier style could now be his undoing, if the SEC does manage to get him unseated. Tesla\u2019s stock fell more than 10 percent in after-hours trading.  The speed of the SEC\u2019s action adds gravity. It often takes the agency at least a year to bring allegations. Elizabeth Holmes, the chief executive of venture-funded medical testing firm Theranos, didn\u2019t face SEC charges until two years after her company had been banned by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services from running a lab. She was fined and barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years.  Even after factoring in Thursday\u2019s post-market decline, Tesla still trades at a turbocharged 31 times estimated earnings for 2020. That\u2019s high for a carmaker that has serially failed to hit its targets, and is largely down to the premium investors afford Musk himself. Assume the shares of a Musk-less Tesla stabilize around 11 times 2020 earnings \u2013 roughly 50 percent higher than BMW\u2019s multiple. It would then be worth some $14 billion, three-quarters less than at Thursday\u2019s close.  At that price, Tesla could even be an attractive takeover target. Much, though, depends on it first being able to speed past a looming liquidity crunch. The company is burning cash and has $1.2 billion of debt that comes due by March. The SEC throwing the book at Musk is a seismic event, but it isn\u2019t the only problem that could force Tesla onto a dramatically different path.","578":"Dec 1 (Reuters) - A former Tesla Inc factory employee will pay Elon Musk\u2019s electric car maker $400,000 after it accused him of tipping reporters about alleged production inefficiencies and delays, a court filing shows.  The payment by Martin Tripp, a former process technician at Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada, was part of a settlement detailed in a Monday filing with the federal court in that city. It requires approval by Chief Judge Miranda Du.  Tesla and Musk became embroiled in a public dispute with Tripp in June 2018, when it fired and then sued him.  The Palo Alto, California-based company accused Tripp of writing software to hack into its manufacturing operating system, stealing trade secrets, and making false claims to reporters about information he stole.  Du has said Tripp characterized himself as a whistleblower who had identified production inefficiencies and delays in Tesla\u2019s effort to produce 5,000 Model 3 cars each week.  In September, the judge dismissed Tripp\u2019s defamation counterclaim over statements from Tesla, including an email to employees where Musk accused him of \u201csabotage,\u201d saying Tripp did not show actual malice.  According to the court filing, Tripp did not contest Tesla\u2019s claims that he stole trade secrets, and acknowledged that his counterclaims were funded by a short seller of Tesla stock.

I was caught by surprise by the cathode manufacturing process and the new aluminum-based alloys.\u201d  Gary Koenig, an associate professor at the University of Virginia: \u201cIt seems like often people are looking for a new type of battery, but changing things like form factor can make a big difference, and a lot of the Battery Day discussion mentioned those advances. Making processing easier and faster, and even successfully making the (battery) wider or electrodes thicker, can make relatively big improvements at the larger pack level.\u201d  \u201cAs Musk mentioned, battery electrode processing involves adding and later removing solvent, so it seems intuitively like there should be a way to cut out that step. The solvent addition really helps to blend the multiple desired components, so getting good adhesion and mixing without the solvent I expect to be challenging.\u201d","581":"TOKYO, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has started using batteries that Panasonic Corp designed for Tesla Inc in some of its plug-in hybrids sold in China, the Nikkei business daily reported on Friday.  Toyota is using Panasonic\u2019s cylindrical batteries in its new Corolla and Levin plug-in hybrid sedans launched in China this year, the Nikkei said, without citing sources.

Musk and Tesla will pay $20 million each, bring in two independent directors and have the billionaire step down as board chairman to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that Musk misled investors by tweeting he had financing for a go-private deal.  That settlement must still be approved by a court, and does not end the Justice Department probe disclosed by Tesla into Musk\u2019s tweets or lawsuits by short-sellers and other investors alleging losses and securities law violations.  \u201cThe real worry for the company is not the SEC but private actions that follow a settlement like this,\u201d said Charles M. Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cBy paying that size fine, it bolsters investors\u2019\u201d claims over stock market losses, he said.  Neither Musk nor Tesla admitted or denied the SEC\u2019s findings as part of the settlement.  Musk settled with the SEC after advisers persuaded him the terms were favorable and a lengthy court fight would not be in the best interest of the company, a person familiar with the deal said. Musk had wanted to personally pay the fine for money-losing Tesla but the SEC rejected that proposal, the person said.  Tesla shares plunged around 14 percent on Friday, the day after the SEC charged Musk with misleading investors, and are down 30 percent since his Aug. 7 tweet saying he was considering taking the company private at $420 a share.  Investor claims could result in substantial settlements in cash or equity, Elson said. An equity settlement could end up diluting Musk\u2019s roughly 19 percent stake in Tesla, further reducing his influence on the board.  Still, Tesla shares could stabilize on Monday on investor relief that the penalties were not higher and that the public face of Tesla will remain in the CEO role under added oversight, analysts said.  Tesla is expected to release third-quarter production this week, and investors are watching to see if it hit targets for the Model 3, a high-volume car. Whether Tesla made a profit likely will not be known until it reports financial results for the quarter.  The settlement disclosed by the SEC on Saturday \u201cis a positive outcome for Elon Musk, Tesla and ultimately shareholders,\u201d wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak, who added he expects Tesla shares to recoup some of their losses from last week.  An expanded board and new chairman offers hope \u201ca true check on Elon will emerge and there will be greater accountability\u201d over Musk\u2019s statements and business targets, Spak added.  Tesla and Musk ended up accepting harsher penalties than the SEC originally proposed to settle the claims, according to the person familiar with the deal. The SEC initially was ready to accept a fine of a few million dollars and Musk\u2019s removal as chairman for two years, but raised its demands after Musk balked at that offer, the person said.

If so, according to a summary judgment ruling issued Tuesday by Vice-Chancellor Joseph Slights of Delaware Chancery Court, Delaware law presumes that he wielded coercive influence over Tesla shareholders who voted to approve the company\u2019s $2.6 billion acquisition of the Musk startup SolarCity in 2016.  Tesla shareholders, represented by Grant & Eisenhofer, Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check and Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, contend that Musk pushed Tesla to rescue SolarCity from insolvency, breaching his fiduciary duty and wasting Tesla assets. Tesla directors, including Musk, have argued throughout the long-running litigation that the SolarCity acquisition process was unconflicted and that the deal was approved by shareholders in a fully informed, non-coerced vote. (All of the directors except for Musk agreed last month to a $60 million, insurance-funded settlement of shareholders\u2019 claims.) Vice-Chancellor Slights is scheduled to oversee a 10-day trial of shareholders\u2019 claims next month.  Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.  The key to the case is the standard of review that the Chancery judge will apply to shareholders\u2019 claims. Shareholders have a vastly better chance of tagging Musk with liability if they can persuade the vice-chancellor to evaluate the deal\u2019s entire fairness, rather than deferring to the board\u2019s business judgment \u2013 a standard that pretty much dooms shareholders\u2019 M&A claims.  Musk\u2019s alleged control of Tesla is, in turn, the critical factor in determining which standard should apply. When there\u2019s no controlling shareholder, Delaware law gives wide latitude to boards\u2019 decisionmaking. Under the state Supreme Court\u2019s 2016 decision in Corwin v. KKR Holdings, directors of companies that have no controlling shareholder are entitled to business judgment deference even if the sales process was flawed, as long as the deal ended up being approved by a majority of shareholders. But Corwin doesn\u2019t shield directors of companies that are under the sway of a controlling shareholder. To protect minority shareholders from the controller\u2019s potentially conflicting interests, those deals are subject to judicial review of their entire fairness.  Vice-Chancellor Slights already ruled, back in 2018, that Tesla shareholders plausibly alleged Musk\u2019s control in their complaint. The judge denied Tesla directors\u2019 motion to dismiss the case at the pleading stage, concluding that shareholders\u2019 allegations about Musk\u2019s voting interest, outsized influence at the company and domination of the SolarCity deal process added up to an inference that Musk wielded the power of a controlling shareholder.  But that 2018 decision only entitled shareholders to move ahead with discovery. Last summer, the board\u2019s lawyers at Cravath Swaine & Moore and Ross Aronstam & Moritz told the judge that investors had failed to establish in discovery that they\u2019re entitled to entire fairness review. In a motion for summary judgment, the board\u2019s lawyers argued (among other things) that the case record showed no evidence that Musk somehow coerced independent shareholders to approve the SolarCity acquisition. So, according to the board\u2019s brief, the business judgment standard must apply to a deal that was conditioned upon \u2013 and subsequently approved in \u2013 an uncoerced, fully-informed shareholder vote.  \u201cThere is nothing in the record that could support a finding that the sophisticated institutional investors here were willing to risk breaching their own fiduciary duties to their clients out of fear of some alleged \u2018potent retributive capacity\u2019 on the part of Musk,\u201d the board\u2019s brief said.  Shareholders argued in their summary judgment brief that Vice-Chancellor Slights must apply the entire fairness standard regardless of Musk\u2019s control because the board was hopelessly conflicted and shareholders were duped into backing an acquisition that was misrepresented in Tesla\u2019s proxy disclosures.  In Tuesday\u2019s decision, the vice-chancellor mostly denied both sides\u2019 requests for summary judgment, concluding that he needs to delve more deeply into the facts to decide which standard of evaluation to use.  Importantly, though, he held that shareholders don\u2019t have to come up with specific evidence that Musk coerced independent shareholders to approve the SolarCity deal. Delaware law, he said, presumes that controlling shareholders have \u201cinherently coercive\u201d power over their fellow investors.  \u201cA conflicted controller has strong incentives to engage in transactions that benefit him to the detriment of the corporation and its other stockholders,\u201d Vice-Chancellor Slights wrote. \u201cAnd, as an 800-pound gorilla in the board room and at the ballot box, the controller has retributive capacities that lead our courts to question whether independent directors or voting shareholders can freely exercise their judgment in approving transactions sponsored by the controller. In these circumstances, shareholders are entitled to an independent review where the controller is made to explain why the transaction\u2019s process and price were fair.\u201d  Defense lawyers had argued that Delaware precedent on controlling shareholders\u2019 inherently coercive power only addresses pleading-stage litigation. Once a case moves past discovery, they argued, shareholders have to provide proof that the controlling shareholder swayed the vote. Otherwise, their brief said, the shareholder vote should be treated as uncoerced \u2013 and the deal should be reviewed under the business judgment standard.  Vice-Chancellor Slights hailed that \u201cingenious\u201d argument \u2013 but rejected it. Delaware courts developed their precedent on the coercive power of controlling shareholders because they understand how the world works, he said: The ability to control is self-fulfilling. And though the vice-chancellor conceded that even some of the Delaware jurists who originated the theory have subsequently questioned it in a law review article, the presumption that a controlling shareholder has inherently coercive power remains good law.  Of course, Slights said, to invoke the entire fairness standard of review, investors must still show that Musk was, in fact, a controlling shareholder by dint of his outsized influence at the company. And even if shareholders clear that hurdle, Musk can still prove at trial that the SolarCity deal was fair, which is exactly what defense lawyers have been arguing since the case began.  I emailed Evan Chesler of Cravath and shareholder counsel Christine Mackintosh of Grant & Eisenhofer for comment on Vice-Chancellor Slights\u2019 decision but didn\u2019t hear back.

REUTERS\/Carlos Barria  (Reuters) - Startup Lordstown Motors Corp RIDE.O said on Monday it remained \"on track\" to begin building electric pickup trucks next September at a former General Motors Co GM.N plant in northeastern Ohio.  Less than two years old, Lordstown Motors plans to pit its battery-powered Endurance pickup against a raft of competitors from other newcomers such as Rivian and Nikola, as well as established manufacturers such as GM, Ford Motor Co F.N and Tesla Inc TSLA.O.  Because the market for electric pickups is untested, demand from consumers and commercial fleets is uncertain.  That hasn\u2019t hampered investor enthusiasm. Shares in Lordstown Motors, which went public in late October, were up nearly 10% at $19.64 in mid-morning trading after surging more than 12% earlier on Monday.  In a statement early Monday, Lordstown Motors said it had begun building a plant to assemble battery packs and wheel-mounted \u201chub\u201d motors for the Endurance pickup, and plans to hire 1,500 employees by the end of 2021.

(Reuters) - Elon Musk\u2019s multi-billion dollar compensation package should be rescinded and the board of Tesla Inc should be overhauled to better protect investors in the electronic car company, according to a law suit filed by a shareholder on Thursday.  Elon Musk speaks at Boring Company community meeting in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California, U.S. May 17, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  The lawsuit accused the board of corporate waste and Musk, the company\u2019s chief executive officer and chairman, of unjust enrichment.  The lawsuit is seeking class action status.  Tesla said in a statement that the lawsuit \u201cseeks to take the power from our shareholders and instead give it to plaintiffs lawyers. We will respond accordingly.\u201d  Musk received the support of the company\u2019s shareholders in March for a package that Tesla estimated to be worth $2.6 billion.  A Morgan Stanley analyst estimated the package could be worth up to $70 billion if the company continues to grow quickly. While the award of the pay package cooled speculation that Musk might be planning to quit, it was also criticized for its unprecedented size.  Proxy advisory services ISS and Glass Lewis both had recommended shareholders reject the package.  \u201cThe new E. Musk compensation plan is so large it dwarfs the pay package of every other public company CEO,\u201d said the complaint by Richard Tornetta that was unsealed on Thursday in Delaware\u2019s Court of Chancery.  Tesla\u2019s statement noted that Musk gets nothing unless the company\u2019s market value doubles and continues to increase until it becomes one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies.  Much of the complaint describing the how the pay package is unfair was redacted.  The complaint said Tornetta obtained corporate records from Tesla as permitted under Delaware corporate law. Companies sometimes provide that information only if a shareholder signs a non-disclosure agreement.  The lawsuit was unsealed days after shareholders rejected a shareholder proposal to strip Musk of the chairman role.  That had represented the strongest challenge yet to Musk\u2019s grip on the Silicon Valley car maker, which also faces production setbacks and expectations by many analysts that it will need to raise new cash.  The case was assigned to Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights. In March, Slights ruled against Tesla\u2019s request for an early dismissal of a shareholder class action challenging the company\u2019s acquisition of SolarCity Corp, a renewable energy company.  The lawsuit alleged that Musk used his power over Tesla\u2019s board to buy SolarCity at a price that unfairly benefited Musk, a large shareholder in SolarCity.  The SolarCity deal closed in November 2016.  That case is proceeding to trial.","586":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc will unveil its Model Y on March 14 at an event in LA Design Studio, Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Sunday.  \"Model Y, being an SUV, is about 10 percent bigger than Model 3, so will cost about 10 percent more & have slightly less range for same battery,\" Musk said in a tweet here  The Shanghai Gigafactory, based in eastern China, aims to manufacture Model 3 and Model Y cars, with annual capacity of 250,000 vehicles.

But his record shows he is more of a fast learner who forged alliances with firms that had technology Tesla lacked, hired some of their most talented people, and then powered through the boundaries that limited more risk-averse partners.  Now, Musk and his team are preparing to outline new steps in Tesla\u2019s drive to become a more self-sufficient company less reliant on suppliers at its \u201cBattery Day\u201d event on Sept. 22.  Musk has been dropping hints for months that significant advances in technology will be announced as Tesla strives to produce the low-cost, long-lasting batteries that could put its electric cars on a more equal footing with cheaper gasoline vehicles.  New battery cell designs, chemistries and manufacturing processes are just some of the developments that would allow Tesla to reduce its reliance on its long-time battery partner, Japan\u2019s Panasonic, people familiar with the situation said.  \u201cElon doesn\u2019t want any part of his business to be dependent on someone else,\u201d said one former senior executive at Tesla who declined to be named. \u201cAnd for better or worse - sometimes better, sometimes worse - he thinks he can do it better, faster and cheaper.\u201d  Tesla has battery production partnerships with Panasonic, South Korea\u2019s LG Chem and China\u2019s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) that are expected to continue.  But at the same time, Tesla is moving to control production of cells - the basic component of electric vehicle battery packs \u2014 at highly automated factories, including one being built near Berlin, Germany and another in Fremont, California where Tesla is hiring dozens of experts in battery cell engineering and manufacturing.  \u201cThere has been no change in our relationship with Tesla,\u201d Panasonic said in a statement provided by a company spokeswoman.  \u201cOur relationship, both past and present has been sound. Panasonic is not a supplier to Tesla; we are partners. There\u2019s no doubt our partnership will continue to innovate and contribute to the betterment of society.\u201d  Tesla did not respond immediately to a request for comment.  MAKE EVERYTHING  Since he took over the fledgling company in 2004, Musk\u2019s goal has been to learn enough - from partnerships, acquisitions and talent recruitment - to bring key technologies under Tesla\u2019s control, people familiar with Tesla\u2019s strategy said.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  They said the aim was to build a heavily vertically integrated company, or a digital version of Ford Motor Co\u2019s iron-ore-to-Model-A production system of the late 1920s.  \u201cElon thought he could improve on everything the suppliers did - everything,\u201d said former Tesla supply chain executive Tom Wessner, who is now head of industry consultancy Imprint Advisors. \u201cHe wanted to make everything.\u201d  Batteries, a big chunk of the cost of an electric car, are central to the Musk method. While subordinates have argued for years against developing proprietary Tesla battery cells, Musk continues to drive toward that goal.  \u201cTell him \u2018No\u2019, and then he really wants to do it,\u201d said a third former Tesla veteran.  The changes in battery design, chemistry and production processes Tesla expects to reveal next week are aimed at reworking the math that until now has made electric cars more expensive than carbon-emitting vehicles with combustion engines.  Reuters reported in May that Tesla is planning to unveil low-cost batteries designed to last for a million miles. Tesla is also working to secure direct supplies of key battery materials, such as nickel, while developing cell chemistries that would no longer need expensive cobalt as well as highly automated manufacturing processes to speed up production.  \u2018STRAIGHT FOR MARS\u2019  Panasonic is partnered with Tesla at the $5 billion Nevada \u201cGigafactory\u201d, while CATL and LG Chem supply cells to Tesla\u2019s Shanghai factory, where battery modules and packs are assembled for its Model 3 sedan.  Panasonic recently said it is planning to expand its production lines in Nevada, which supply the cells that then go into the battery modules assembled next door by Tesla.  But the Nevada Gigafactory partnership almost didn\u2019t happen, according to two former Tesla executives. Musk ordered a team to study battery manufacturing in 2011, according to one former executive, but eventually partnered with Panasonic in 2013.  Now, Tesla is testing a battery cell pilot manufacturing line in Fremont and is building its own vast automated cell manufacturing facility in Gruenheide in Germany.  The roller-coaster relationship with Panasonic mirrors other Tesla alliances.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  During its development alliance with Germany\u2019s Daimler, which was an early investor in Tesla, Musk became interested in sensors that would help keep cars within traffic lanes.  Until then the Tesla Model S, which Mercedes-Benz engineers helped refine, lacked cameras or sophisticated driver assistance sensors and software such as those used in the Mercedes S-Class.  \u201cHe learned about that and took it a step further. We asked our engineers to shoot for the moon. He went straight for Mars,\u201d said a senior Daimler engineer said.  Meanwhile, an association with Japan\u2019s Toyota, another early investor, taught him about quality management.  Eventually, executives from Daimler and Toyota joined Tesla in key roles, along with talent from Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as rival carmakers Ford, BMW and Audi.  THE MUSK SPIN  Some relationships did not end well, however.  Tesla hooked up with Israeli sensor maker Mobileye in 2014, in part to learn how to design a self-driving system that evolved into Tesla\u2019s Autopilot.  \u201cMobileye was the driving force behind the original Autopilot,\u201d said a former Mobileye executive, who declined to be named.  Mobileye, which is now owned by Intel, also recognized the risk of sharing technology with a fast-moving startup like Tesla, which was on the brink of collapse at the end of 2008 and now has a market value of $420 billion.  But Tesla and Mobileye had an acrimonious and public split after a driver was killed in 2016 when a Model S using the Autopilot system crashed.  At the time, Amnon Shashua, who is now Mobileye president and chief executive, said Tesla\u2019s Autopilot was not designed to cover all possible crash situations as it was a driver assistance system, not a driverless system.  The former Mobileye executive said there was no question of Tesla improperly using their technology.  U.S. tech firm Nvidia followed Mobileye as a supplier for Autopilot, but it too was ultimately sidelined.  \u201cNvidia and Tesla share a common strategy of developing software-defined vehicles powered by high-performance AI computers. Elon is very focused on vertical integration and wanted to make his own chips,\u201d said Nvidia\u2019s senior director of automotive, Danny Shapiro.  In addition to partnerships, Musk went on an acquisition spree four years ago, buying a handful of little-known companies - Grohmann, Perbix, Riviera, Compass, Hibar Systems - to rapidly advance Tesla\u2019s expertise in automation. Maxwell and SilLion further boosted Tesla\u2019s ability in battery technology.  \u201cHe learned a lot from those people,\u201d said Mark Ellis, a senior consultant at Munro & Associates, which has studied Tesla extensively. \u201cHe leveraged a lot of information from them, then put his spin on making it better.\u201d","589":"SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The board of Tesla Inc said on Friday the company would remain public, following a tumultuous two weeks for the carmaker after its chief executive announced he was considering a deal to go private.

These two very different towns have one thing in common: They are both on the short list to land a $1.1 billion vehicle assembly plant for Tesla Inc TSLA.O - and up to 20,000 new jobs.  With a decision expected within a few weeks, the Austin-versus-Tulsa contest is heating up as Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, stoke a bidding war over tax breaks and other concessions that would reduce the factory\u2019s cost.  Travis County, home to Austin, is expected to vote this week on a portion of ten-year tax rebates totaling more than $65 million. The company told Texas officials the new plant would create at least 5,000 jobs, while Oklahoma officials were told about the creation of at least 7,000 jobs in the near term and up to 20,000 positions down the line.  But some Austin residents have told officials they are skeptical about subsidizing what is now the world's most valuable auto company, after previously turning away Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.  \u201cInstead of focusing to get people a living wage ... you\u2019re giving tax breaks to a company that\u2019s worth billions.

Tesla in public filings with Travis County said local and state tax incentives \u201cserve a critical role\u201d in getting the new factory under way and successfully compete against longstanding industry rivals. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment for this story.  In Oklahoma, Tesla fever is on full display.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  That Golden Driller statue? It was recently repainted by a local Tesla fan club to look something like Musk, sporting a Tesla logo on its chest and a belt buckle emblazoned with the company\u2019s name.  Musk himself flew in on July 3 to visit the undeveloped site overlooking Tulsa that would house the new factory, which would build Model Y sport utility vehicles and Tesla\u2019s futuristic Cybertruck. Musk met with the state\u2019s governor under a white tent in the sweltering summer heat, according to pictures posted on Twitter by Oklahoma\u2019s governor, Kevin Stitt.  Oklahoma officials were scheduled to make their pitch to dozens of senior Tesla executives in a Zoom call on Monday afternoon.  \u201cThe response here continues to be overwhelming,\u201d said Oklahoma Commerce Secretary Sean Kouplen. \u201cIn the time that we\u2019re in, having something positive to hold on to or grab is really making a difference.\u201d  Even local retailers have caught the Tesla bug. Kouplen\u2019s children came home the other day with a photo of a special Tesla-themed snow-cone sold by a local store, and a Tulsa pizzeria has promised to give out free pies to all Tesla employees.  Tulsa, once known as the \u201cOil Capital of the World,\u201d is trying to remake its image with a $1 billion renovation of its downtown, including hip coffeehouses, raft races, jazz clubs and efforts to attract white-collar workers who can work remotely.  A new video featuring testimonials from engineers who recently relocated to Tulsa has been viewed 200,000 times, including by Musk, according to Oklahoma officials.  Several websites attempting to appeal to Tesla have sprung up. One, called \u201cBig F*cking Field,\u201d purports to be in the voice of a plot of land and includes humorously fake endorsements by the likes of Thomas Edison.  \u201cWe were the original oil boom town in the \u201820s and it\u2019s a cool way of saying something is changing,\u201d said Jacob Johnson, the creator of the websites and a Tulsa-based digital marketing executive.  In its search for a new plant site, Tesla short-listed eight central U.S. states and received incentive packages from many others, but only Tulsa and Travis County remain in the running. The company told Texas officials its plant would create more than 5,000 mainly low-skilled jobs at an average salary of $47,000.  Oklahoma has signed a nondisclosure agreement about its incentives package, but Kouplen claimed the bid was not only competitive but better in parts than Travis County\u2019s. It includes business and personal tax breaks, most of which were already guaranteed under state law, which meant they would not require the kinds of public votes that have been delayed several times in Austin.  Details on the Travis County tax breaks emerged only during public hearings and it remains unclear whether the state of Texas would provide additional incentives. Governor Greg Abbott\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment.  Squeezing states for incentives is not new to the auto industry. Tesla itself received some $1.4 billion in incentives to build a battery plant in Nevada in 2014 and Alabama attracted German carmaker Mercedes-Benz DAIGn.DE with a $253 million package in the 1990s.  Those outlays now pale compared with the wealth of Musk, who is in reach of a payday potentially worth $1.8 billion as the company\u2019s stock rally continues. Tesla shares have more than quadrupled so far this year as the company increased vehicle sales and is expected to return a second-quarter profit.","592":"Nov 15 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc has cut prices on its residential solar systems by as much as 25 percent in a bid to lift lagging sales after the company streamlined its sales and marketing organization, a company official told Reuters.  Effective on Thursday, price quotes for potential solar customers will be between $3,000 and $5,000 lower, representing savings of between 15 and 25 percent, according to Sanjay Shah, the company\u2019s senior vice president of energy operations.  Since Tesla\u2019s acquisition two years ago of SolarCity, which at the time was the nation\u2019s largest residential solar company, the company has sharply cut the vast sales organization that underpinned its rapid growth.  Last year, Tesla stopped selling solar door-to-door, and earlier this year it ended a long-standing deal to sell solar at 800 Home Depot stores - a relationship that some analysts estimated brought in roughly half Tesla\u2019s solar sales but added up to $7,000 to the cost of a residential system.  That has come alongside a big drop in installations. Tesla deployed just 93 megawatts of solar in the third quarter, down from SolarCity\u2019s more than 200 MW a quarter in early 2016.  Shah said, with lower prices, customer will seek out Tesla at its stores and online.  \u201cEvery customer wants a greater value in terms of price,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you do that the customer comes to you rather than you going to the customer.\u201d  He said the price cuts should make Tesla \u201chighly competitive\u201d and added that the company ultimately wants to be the lowest cost solar provider in the country.  Solar energy systems from large installers average about 10 percent more expensive than those sold by smaller companies, according to a 2017 report by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a U.S. government research lab.  Shah said Tesla\u2019s premium solar products are more-efficient than most other panels, and should not be compared to standard systems on price.  The price cuts are made possible in part by the savings Tesla has produced from streamlining its sales operations. By selling directly through its web site and roughly 100 retail stores, Tesla has been able to cut sales and marketing costs in half, Shah said.  Shah joined the company six months ago from Amazon and has focused on making its solar supply chain more efficient, reducing sales and marketing costs, and bringing down the time it takes for rooftop systems to be installed, he said.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Friday it had received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over forecasts it made about Model 3 production in 2017, a set of targets the electric vehicle company failed to hit on time.  The SEC issued subpoenas over \u201ccertain projections that we made for Model 3 production rates during 2017 and other public statements relating to Model 3 production,\u201d Tesla said in a quarterly filing on Friday. A subpoena can compel a company to turn over materials that the requesting agency wants to review.  The SEC had also issued subpoenas in connection with Chief Executive Elon Musk\u2019s previous statements that he was considering taking the company private, it said.  Both the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice are looking at whether Tesla misled investors about its business.  \u201cTo our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred,\u201d Tesla wrote in its filing.  The SEC declined to comment.  The company also said on Friday that 44 percent of its third-quarter net profit was from previously undisclosed regulatory credits.  Investors have been trying to ascertain if the worst is over for the Silicon Valley company amid the fallout from Musk\u2019s short-lived plan in August to take the company private, and determine if Tesla has finally stabilized its rocky Model 3 production and can build the car at a profit.  Following the launch of the Model 3 last year, Tesla repeatedly missed aggressive production targets for the new vehicle, blaming \u201cmanufacturing bottlenecks.\u201d  Jay Dubow, a partner with Pepper Hamilton LLP and former branch chief in the SEC\u2019s enforcement division, said the agency was likely looking at whether Tesla\u2019s projections had been \u201cbased on fact or not.\u201d  \u201cIt is possible for another SEC enforcement action down the road if it turns out that the projections were purposefully or recklessly made without a basis,\u201d Dubow said.  Tesla is already facing a proposed class action shareholder lawsuit claiming that the company and top executives made false statements about the readiness of the Model 3 for volume production. The lawsuit cites repeated promises in 2017 that Tesla was \u201con track\u201d to build 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of that year at its factory in Fremont, California.  Tesla finally met that target in June of this year.  Tesla has denied the claims, saying it disclosed production bottlenecks once identified, and pointing to Musk\u2019s public statements that the company was undergoing a period of \u201cproduction hell\u201d in 2017.  A Tesla spokesperson told Reuters last week that the company had received a voluntary request from the Department of Justice for documents related to Model 3 production forecasts, but had not received a subpoena.  ZERO EMISSION CREDITS  Tesla has weathered a rocky few months in the wake of Musk\u2019s tweets that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d for a deal, later scuttled, to take Tesla private. Musk and Tesla settled with the SEC in September after the agency sued for fraud.  The settlement required Tesla and Musk to pay a fine of $20 million each and for Musk to give up his chairman role for three years.  Last week, investors were cheered by the company\u2019s third-quarter net profit, wider margins and positive cash flow, which sent shares climbing.  The company said then it had booked $52 million in \u201czero emission vehicle\u201d credit sales. It did not say at the time that it had gained another $137 million in regulatory credits, which contributed to nearly half of the profit.  Tesla also said in its quarterly filing that it planned to start building about 3,000 Model 3 vehicles per week in Shanghai in the initial phase of its Gigafactory 3, to reduce the impact of tariffs.  Model S and Model X sales in China will likely continue to be hurt by recently increased tariffs imposed by the Chinese government on U.S.-manufactured vehicles, it said.  Tesla shares closed up less than half a percent to $346.41 on Friday.","594":"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE is paring back the variety of combustion-engined cars and retooling more factories to build electric vehicles in an effort to keep up with rival Tesla TSLA.O, the chief executive of the world's largest carmaker said.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of German carmaker Volkswagen is seen on a rim cap in a showroom of a Volkswagen car dealer in Brussels, Belgium July 9, 2020. REUTERS\/Francois Lenoir  German factories in Emden and Hanover will be converted to build electric cars as part of a 73 billion euros ($86 billion) investment plan to ramp up development of zero-emission and self-driving cars, the company said on Monday.  \u201cOur business so far has been running valuable brands. To increase brand value, driving margins,\u201d Herbert Diess explained in a call with investors and analysts on Monday. \u201cWe have to be seen as a tech company.\u201d  On top of focussing on achieving economies of scale in electric and combustion engine components, Volkswagen is seeking to also gain expertise in software programming, so it can build and develop intelligent self-driving vehicles.  \u201cYes, it is going to be a race with Tesla,\u201d Diess said.  \u201cThey are also ramping up fast. We have more different body styles, and when it comes to an established dealership network, we should have an advantage over Tesla,\u201d Diess said.  Policymakers have clamped down on exhaust emissions, forcing carmakers to accelerate the development of low-emission technology or face a penalty of 95 euros for each gram of excess CO2 they emit in Europe.  The Volkswagen factory in Hanover will be retooled to build the all-electric VW ID.BUZZ microbus, as well as large premium-branded electric sports utility vehicles for Audi, Bentley and Porsche, which will share common vehicle underpinnings.  \u201cThe rationale was keeping those cars together in one manufacturing site,\u201d Diess explained.  The VW factory in Emden will be retooled to build electric cars and production of the combustion-engined VW Passat sedan will be shifted to a factory in Bratislava, Slovakia where VW will also build the next generation Skoda Superb.  SUVs SALES PAY FOR CLEANER TECH  Low end Volkswagen variants will see their prices increased or be struck from the lineup altogether, Diess said, adding that European policymaker proposals for further tightening emissions rules are effectively putting combustion engines at risk.  \u201cSo long as you have to burn coal to make electric vehicles\u2019 run it doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d Diess said, commenting about the need for burning fossil fuels to generate power for the electricity grid.  \u201cIt would make a lot more sense to postpone those targets because those engines are really clean now,\u201d Diess said of his wish to see combustion engined cars on sale for longer.  Volkswagen needs the profits from combustion engined sports utility vehicles to generate the cash for investing in cleaner technologies, he said.  Shifting the Golf segment of passenger cars to becoming electric will take up to a decade, the carmaker said. It has also forced managers to question the need for some of the more exotic niche brands.  VW is legally separating its Lamborghini supercar and Ducati motorbike brands, confirming an earlier Reuters report, as the German automaker seeks to streamline its operations and focus on mass-producting electric cars.  \u201cWe are working on our Italian legal structure,\u201d Diess said, referring to the creation of a separate legal entity for housing the Lamborghini, Ducati and the Italdesign design studio.  Luxury brands which owe their attractiveness in large part due to high horsepower high-cylinder combustion engines, may not fit in to the era of intelligent, networked vehicles which provide on-demand mobility, Diess said.  \u201cAre those really valuable in the new world, we don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Diess said.  The CEO said on Monday that Volkswagen would miss its CO2 compliance target this year by \u201ca gram or so\u201d but would meet emissions goals for 2021 thanks to a mass production push of electric vehicles.  He saw business recovering next year, with the company planning for a return to pre-COVID crisis levels in 2022, he added.","595":"BEIJING, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Friday said it had started delivering Model 3 cars in China, slightly ahead of schedule.

REUTERS\/Joe Skipper\/File Photo  The UAW, which is seeking to represent workers at Tesla\u2019s facility in Fremont, California, filed the complaint with the National Labor Relations Board late on Wednesday.  Musk in a tweet on Monday said there was nothing stopping Tesla workers from joining a union, but \u201cwhy pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing?\u201d  The union says Musk violated the National Labor Relations Act, which prohibits employers from making threats or promises to workers to discourage them from joining unions.  Tesla in a statement said Musk\u2019s comment simply recognized that other automakers whose workers are represented by the UAW do not provide stock options.  \u201cUAW organizers have consistently dismissed the value of Tesla equity as part of our compensation package,\u201d the company said.  In a separate tweet, Musk accused the UAW of driving General Motors and Chrysler to bankruptcy and losing \u201c200,000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect.\u201d  He was apparently referring to effects of the crisis in the U.S. auto industry in 2008-2010.

In August, based on a separate UAW complaint, the NLRB found that Tesla had violated workers\u2019 rights by requiring them to sign a confidentiality agreement that could bar them from talking about their working conditions and safety issues at the California plant.  In October, the UAW filed yet another complaint with the NLRB accusing Tesla of firing 400 workers who supported the union\u2019s campaign. The electric carmaker is also facing lawsuits accusing it of discriminating against black, gay, and older workers. Tesla has denied those claims.  Williams told reporters that a decision on when to hold a unionization vote at the Tesla plant will not come until a new UAW president is seated later this year.  A challenge for the union and its organizers has been the high rate of worker turnover at Tesla.","597":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - With Tesla Inc's TSLA.O shares briefly dipping below the $300 level on Thursday, the electric carmaker ceded its seat as the most shorted U.S. stock to Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, according to data from financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Their view vastly differs from that of traditional analysts and institutional investors, who want to hear updates on Tesla\u2019s 2020 cash flow and potential moves to boost demand during a prolonged recession due to the epidemic.  Submitting questions for Tesla's earnings call on a website here, retail investors want to learn about Tesla's steps to expand into the robotaxi market, the company's self-driving technology and even plans to create airless tires to reduce maintenance costs.  Of the top 50 questions, only four refer to the novel coronavirus, with one investor asking what safeguards Tesla would implement to protect employees at U.S. factories. Another probed whether Tesla had plans to expand into the grocery delivery market, where demand has skyrocketed during the pandemic.  Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk early Wednesday morning tweeted \u201cFREE AMERICA NOW\u201d and shared an opinion article arguing that severe lockdown orders have not saved many lives, tweeting \u201cGive people their freedom back.\u201d  Analysts expect Musk to provide details on Tesla\u2019s plans to restart factory operations after its only U.S. vehicle factory near San Francisco was forced to close at the end of March. The company originally said it would resume operations on May 4, but Bay Area health officials on Monday extended shelter-in-place orders to the end of May.  Investors can vote for a particular question on the website and Tesla management generally answers the most popular ones during an earnings call.  Currently, the No. 1 retail investor question is whether Musk will stick to his target for a 50% compound annual growth rate over the next five to 10 years, or whether a 40% target would be more realistic.  Many analysts expect Tesla to have a compound annual growth rate of around 20%.  Analysts on average expect March quarter revenue to jump 30% to $5.9 billion, according to Refinitiv, down from an initial February estimate of $6.7 billion.  Tesla in early April reported strong vehicle deliveries in the first three months of 2020 - a time when other U.S. carmakers grappled with a slump in sales as virus woes and lockdown restrictions began taking hold.  The company in mid-February raised $2 billion in a stock offering, and investors on Wednesday will probe whether that covers the company\u2019s cash burn at a time when Tesla ramps up production of its new Model Y sport utility vehicle.","599":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Tesla Inc blew past $500 billion in market value on Tuesday as investors snapped up its shares in the run-up to its debut in the S&P 500, extending a meteoric rally that has seen it surge over 500% this year.

Analysts questioned whether the $2,000 price cut on all models signaled lower demand in the United States, and ultimately whether the move would undermine nascent profitability at the Silicon Valley automaker, which has never posted an annual profit.  \u201cIn our view, this move could suggest that what many bulls assume to be a substantial backlog ... for Tesla may be less robust,\u201d wrote Bank of America analyst John Murphy in a client note.  Chief Executive Elon Musk, who has often set goals and deadlines that Tesla has failed to meet, surprised investors by delivering on his pledge to make Tesla profitable in the third quarter, for only the third time in its 15-year existence. But the company is unprofitable for the first nine months of 2018, and cash flow remains a concern for investors.  Musk has been under intense pressure to deliver on his promise of stabilizing production for the Model 3, which is deemed crucial for easing a cash crunch and achieving long-term profitability. It said it was churning out almost 1,000 Model 3s daily, broadly in line with Musk\u2019s promises but slightly short of Wall Street expectations.  The company said it would begin delivering Model 3s to Europe and China in February.  The price cut of $2,000 beginning on Wednesday on the Model 3 - as well as on its higher-priced Model S and Model X - took the market by surprise and weighed on the stock, pushing it down 6.8 percent to close at $310.12, after falling as much as 10 percent during the session.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  The lower price comes as automakers expect U.S. new vehicle sales to weaken in 2019, and amid increased competition from new electric vehicle entrants. Tesla sales benefited from a $7,500 federal tax credit on electric vehicles throughout 2018, but that full credit expired at the end of 2018, and new buyers will now receive only half that amount.  Under a major tax overhaul passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress in 2017, tax credits that lower the cost of electric vehicles are available for the first 200,000 such vehicles sold by an automaker. The tax credit is then reduced by 50 percent every six months until it phases out.  \u201cThe price cut is what\u2019s driving the stock lower, as it openly acknowledges the sunset of subsidy dollars is a material headwind,\u201d said Craig Irwin, an analyst with Roth Capital Partners.  But some said fears of eroded demand were overblown. Gene Munster of Loup Ventures calculated that the lowered tax credit equaled, on average, a 3 percent discount on a Tesla. If Tesla had a demand issue, therefore, the company would have cut its prices by more than 3 percent, he wrote in a note.  General Motors sold its 200,000th electric vehicle in the United States in 2018, similarly triggering a phase-out of the federal tax credit, a source said on Wednesday. GM declined to comment.

Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Nicholas Hyett estimated in a client note that if Tesla continues to deliver cars at the current rate, the price cut will mean $700 million in lost revenue in 2019.  Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, meanwhile, said the price cut was \u201ca potential positive\u201d for demand, \u201cbut not what the bulls wanted to hear on the impact to profitability and ultimately the bottom line.\u201d  Tesla delivered 63,150 Model 3s in its fourth quarter, falling short of FactSet estimates of 64,900. Tesla said that based on its own compilation of analysts\u2019 forecasts, its delivery numbers were in line with market expectations.  Bank of America analyst John Murphy wrote that the numbers were in line with market consensus, though below the bank\u2019s estimate of 71,500 Model 3s.  Total deliveries rose from the third quarter to 90,700 cars, but missed forecasts, which had been influenced by analysts\u2019 expectations of a surge in buyers looking to cash in on the tax credit before year-end.  Reuters calculated that Tesla\u2019s third-quarter pretax profit was around $3,200 per vehicle delivered. That would mean a $2,000 price cut could eliminate more than half of that gain. For the first nine months of 2018, the company suffered a third-quarter loss per vehicle delivered of $8,019.  Overall, total production rose 8 percent to 86,555 vehicles. The company churned out 61,394 Model 3s, up from a total of 53,239 Model 3s in the third quarter.  \u201cTesla disappointed the market. The deliveries are below our estimates and the consensus estimates. I don\u2019t expect that Tesla operates in the black in 2019,\u201d said Frank Schwope, an analyst with NORD\/LB.","609":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Wednesday its general counsel Dane Butswinkas is leaving the electric carmaker just two months into the job, the latest in a string of top-level departures at the company.

REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol\/File Photo  Butswinkas, who joined Tesla in December and was reporting to Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, will return to his previous role as the company\u2019s outside counsel at law firm Williams & Connolly.  Jonathan Chang, Tesla\u2019s vice president of legal department, will replace Butswinkas effective immediately, the company said in an email statement to Reuters. Before joining Tesla in 2011, Chang was its outside counsel at law firm Latham & Watkins.  Tesla hired Butswinkas as an outside counsel last year to help settle a case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after Musk tweeted that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 a share.  Musk later settled the charges with the U.S. regulator by agreeing to pay a $20 million fine and relinquishing his position as Tesla\u2019s chairman for three years.  Butswinkas is the latest among the dozens of high-profile executives to leave Tesla over the past two years even as the carmaker struggles to ramp up production of Model 3 sedans, which is seen as crucial for the its long-term profitability.  Tesla, which last month missed Wall Street profit targets for the last quarter of 2018, said Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja would leave after 11 years with the company.  Tesla is facing increased competition from new electric vehicle entrants and was last month forced to cut U.S. prices for all its vehicles to offset lower green tax credits, a move that could impact its margins.  In a bid to save capital and produce cheaper Model 3 cars, Tesla has cut jobs and ended a customer referral program.  Investors continue to worry whether Tesla, which has never posted an annual profit, would be able to ramp up production of Model 3 cars.  In a tweet on Tuesday, Musk estimated that Tesla would make around 500,000 Model 3s in 2019. He quickly clarified that the delivery target this year would be 400,000 cars.  Shares of the company were down 1 percent in morning trading.","610":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Elon Musk\u2019s lawyers said that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission failed to satisfy its heavy burden of showing that the Tesla Inc chief executive should be held in contempt, and the tweet prompting its contempt motion was both proper and \u201cnot material.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: SpaceX founder Elon Musk looks on at a post-launch news conference after the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft, lifted off on an uncrewed test flight to the International Space Station from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S., March 2, 2019. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  In a Friday filing in Manhattan federal court, Musk\u2019s lawyers also said their client \u201crespects his obligations\u201d to the electric car company, its shareholders and the court.  Musk is trying to avoid being held in contempt for violating his October 2018 fraud settlement with the SEC, for having tweeted at 7:15 p.m. EST on Feb. 19 to his over 24 million Twitter followers that Tesla could build around 500,000 vehicles in 2019.  SEC spokesman Ryan White declined to comment.  Musk\u2019s settlement, including $20 million civil fines for both him and Tesla, resolved an SEC lawsuit over an Aug. 7, 2018 Twitter post in which Musk said he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take his Palo Alto, California-based company private at $420 a share.  The SEC said Musk committed a \u201cblatant\u201d violation of that settlement by tweeting about Tesla\u2019s production outlook without first seeking approval from the company\u2019s lawyers.  In a Monday filing, the SEC went farther, complaining that Musk had never after the settlement sought pre-approval for any Tesla-related tweets.  But in Friday\u2019s filing, Musk\u2019s lawyers said the SEC had conceded during settlement talks that Tesla-related tweets were not subject to a broad pre-approval requirement.  They also said the tweet was not material because it simply restated old news, used generalities, was \u201caspirational and optimistic,\u201d and did not move Tesla\u2019s share price.  \u201cThe key question is whether Musk complied with Tesla\u2019s policy, not whether the SEC is satisfied with Tesla\u2019s policy,\u201d Musk\u2019s lawyers wrote. \u201cMusk\u2019s belief that the 7:15 tweet did not require pre-approval was correct.\u201d  Musk has until March 26 to tell U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan whether he wants an evidentiary hearing on the contempt motion. The SEC has said no hearing is necessary.  The October settlement required Musk to step down as Tesla\u2019s chairman. Legal experts said a contempt finding could subject him to a higher fine, further restrictions on his activities, or even removal from Tesla\u2019s board or as chief executive.

The link to the full blog is: here  Taking Tesla Private  The following email was sent to Tesla employees today:  Earlier today, I announced that I\u2019m considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420\/share. I wanted to let you know my rationale for this, and why I think this is the best path forward. First, a final decision has not yet been made, but the reason for doing this is all about creating the environment for Tesla to operate best. As a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders. Being public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long-term. Finally, as the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market, being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company. I fundamentally believe that we are at our best when everyone is focused on executing, when we can remain focused on our long-term mission, and when there are not perverse incentives for people to try to harm what we\u2019re all trying to achieve. This is especially true for a company like Tesla that has a long-term, forward-looking mission. SpaceX is a perfect example: it is far more operationally efficient, and that is largely due to the fact that it is privately held. This is not to say that it will make sense for Tesla to be private over the long-term. In the future, once Tesla enters a phase of slower, more predictable growth, it will likely make sense to return to the public markets. Here\u2019s what I envision being private would mean for all shareholders, including all of our employees. First, I would like to structure this so that all shareholders have a choice. Either they can stay investors in a private Tesla or they can be bought out at $420 per share, which is a 20% premium over the stock price following our Q2 earnings call (which had already increased by 16%). My hope is for all shareholders to remain, but if they prefer to be bought out, then this would enable that to happen at a nice premium. Second, my intention is for all Tesla employees to remain shareholders of the company, just as is the case at SpaceX. If we were to go private, employees would still be able to periodically sell their shares and exercise their options. This would enable you to still share in the growing value of the company that you have all worked so hard to build over time. Third, the intention is not to merge SpaceX and Tesla. They would continue to have separate ownership and governance structures. However, the structure envisioned for Tesla is similar in many ways to the SpaceX structure: external shareholders and employee shareholders have an opportunity to sell or buy approximately every six months. Finally, this has nothing to do with accumulating control for myself. I own about 20% of the company now, and I don\u2019t envision that being substantially different after any deal is completed. Basically, I\u2019m trying to accomplish an outcome where Tesla can operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible, and where there is as little change for all of our investors, including all of our employees, as possible. This proposal to go private would ultimately be finalized through a vote of our shareholders. If the process ends the way I expect it will, a private Tesla would ultimately be an enormous opportunity for all of us. Either way, the future is very bright and we\u2019ll keep fighting to achieve our mission. Thanks, Elon","612":"(Adds CureVac statement)  July 2 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc is building mobile molecule printers to help make the potential COVID-19 vaccine being developed by CureVac in Germany, the electric-car maker\u2019s CEO Elon Musk tweeted on Wednesday.  CureVac, an unlisted German company, has said it is developing portable, automated mRNA production units that it calls printers and which Musk described as \u201cRNA microfactories\u201d.  They are being designed to be shipped to remote locations, where they can churn out its vaccine candidate and other mRNA-based therapies depending on the recipe fed into the machine.  But for the immediate pandemic use - should its vaccine candidate win market approval \u2013 it has production sites with regulatory approval in Germany with a capacity to produce hundreds of millions of doses.  The company, based in Tuebingen and backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, is a pioneer of the so-called messenger RNA approach, which is also pursued by BioNTech and its partner Pfizer as well as Moderna .  A spokeswoman for CureVac confirmed it was working with Tesla\u2019s Grohmann Automation unit on an exclusive printer prototype.  RNA molecules are single-stranded versions of the DNA double-helix. Thanks to their recurring molecular pattern, they can be produced in a relatively simple biochemical process that do not require genetically modified living cells, which are needed to produce most other biotech drugs.  CureVac is also building a new stationary site that could increase its output tenfold to billions of doses.  The \u201cmicrofactories\u201d would be built at Tesla Grohmann Automation in Germany, Musk said in a Twitter thread late on Wednesday night.  Tesla acquired the company that develops automated manufacturing systems for batteries and fuel cells in 2016 to expand its production.  Musk did not elaborate on his plans. Tesla was not immediately available to comment.  Musk, who is known for making impromptu announcements on Twitter, said in March that Tesla had extra FDA-approved ventilators that could be shipped free of cost to hospitals within regions where the electric-car maker delivers.","613":"FILE PHOTO: Newly manufactured cars are seen at a port in Dalian, Liaoning province, China April 10, 2020.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has until March 19 to file a brief, and U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan gave both parties until March 26 to request an evidentiary hearing.  The SEC had asked the court to hold Musk in contempt, saying his Feb. 19 tweet violated a September fraud settlement barring him from sharing material information about Tesla on social media without the company\u2019s preapproval.

When he said that funding for the buyout was secured, Musk said, he was referring to a promise he believed he had received from the managing director of Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. The Saudi fund, he said, had been encouraging him for nearly two years to use its capital to take Tesla private. At a meeting on July 31, after the Saudis acquired a 5 percent stake in Tesla on the public markets, the fund official told Musk it was too bad the company hadn\u2019t previously worked with the Saudis to take Tesla private, according to Musk. The fund official, Musk said, suggested it wasn\u2019t too late to change that.  \u201cHe strongly expressed his support for funding a going private transaction for Tesla at this time,\u201d Musk wrote in his blog post. \u201cI understood from him that no other decision makers were needed and that they were eager to proceed. I left the July 31st meeting with no question that a deal with the Saudi sovereign fund could be closed, and that it was just a matter of getting the process moving. This is why I referred to \u2018funding secured\u2019 in the August 7th announcement.\u201d  The market responded to Musk\u2019s blog post by dumping Tesla shares. The share price fell from a high of nearly $363 just after Monday\u2019s opening to a low of $349 at around noon Monday. (Shares bounced back to over $353 on Monday afternoon.)  Musk and Tesla may have been trying to stanch the stream of revelations that has followed Musk\u2019s tweet: The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Aug. 8 report that the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Musk\u2019s statement; an August 10 Bloomberg story that Tesla was only in the early stages of devising a plan to fund a go-private deal; and Reuters scoops that the Tesla board hadn\u2019t received a financing plan from Musk before his tweet and that Saudi sovereign wealth fund \u201chas shown no interest\u201d in bankrolling a buyout.  But two plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers who filed shareholder class actions against Tesla on Friday told me Monday that Musk\u2019s blog will make it easier for them to pursue investor fraud claims.  \u201cThe blog post is as close as you\u2019re going to get to an admission that funding was not secured when Musk tweeted,\u201d said Reed Kathrein of Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, which filed a securities class action against Musk and Tesla on Friday night in San Francisco federal court. \u201cIt confirms what we thought.\u201d  Tesla declined to comment in response to an email asking whether Musk\u2019s blog post on Monday will make it easier for investors to claim securities fraud.  The Hagens Berman suit, as well as a similar class action filed about an hour earlier by Keller Lenkner, alleges that Musk\u2019s original \u201cfunding secured\u201d tweet and several followup postings artificially inflated the price of Tesla shares. The Keller Lenkner suit claimed Musk was manipulating Tesla\u2019s share price to punish Tesla short-sellers betting against the company\u2019s prospects.  Some short-sellers were so spooked by the spike in Tesla\u2019s share price after Musk\u2019s go-private tweets that they rushed to buy shares to cover their positions. Both Kathrein of Hagens Berman and Travis Lenkner of Keller Lenkner told me many of the hedge funds that have taken short positions in Tesla stock avoided the buying frenzy that followed Musk\u2019s Aug. 7 tweets. Investors who didn\u2019t buy Tesla shares after the Musk tweets cannot be part of the securities fraud class actions because, under U.S. Supreme Court precedent, only investors who trade shares based on corporate misrepresentations \u2013 as opposed to investors who just hold their positions \u2013 are considered to have been affected by the fraud.  When plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers filed their lawsuits late Friday, they could not cite evidence that Musk knew buyout financing wasn\u2019t actually secure at the time he tweeted that it was. The class actions argued that Tesla\u2019s subsequent statements and actions implied uncertainty about the funding of any go-private deal: Why, for example, would Musk and Tesla now be holding meetings with bankers and other funding sources if the buyout financing were as secure as Musk represented it to be?  Musk\u2019s blog post, Lenkner said, removes any ambiguity. \u201cThe statement makes it clear \u2013 funding was not secure when Musk tweeted,\u201d he said.  Kathrein said Musk may have posted his explanation about Saudi funding to show that he really believed the money was in place when he tweeted that his financing was secure. In securities class actions, shareholders have to prove defendants acted with the intention of defrauding shareholders. But Kathrein said the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 decision in Omnicare v. Laborers District Council Construction Industry Pension Fund holds that corporations can\u2019t pretend statements of fact are unactionable opinions.  The quick drop in Tesla\u2019s share price as the market absorbed Musk\u2019s disclosure, Kathrein said, will also help investors prove that Musk\u2019s original tweet artificially inflated Tesla\u2019s value. The share price corrected itself, under this theory, when Musk\u2019s blog post on Monday revealed the truth that Tesla\u2019s buyout funding is not secured. Stock drops following this kind of \u201ccorrective disclosure,\u201d as this is known, are usually at the heart of securities fraud class actions because they allow investors to show the impact of the misrepresentation.  Not just short-sellers are included in the Tesla fraud class actions. Even long-term Tesla investors who bought shares after Musk floated that $420 per share buyout prospect in his Aug. 7 tweet would be part of the investor classes posited in the Hagens Berman and Keller Lenkner suits.  So what was the impact of Musk\u2019s tweet? Both Kathrein and Lenkner estimated that damages could run to $1 billion \u2013 though I should caution that it\u2019s way too early to put a definitive number on Tesla\u2019s exposure. Lenkner said his scratchpad estimate is based on the millions of Tesla shares \u2013 more than $11 billion worth \u2013 traded on Aug. 7 and 8. Even if the share price was inflated by only 10 percent, Lenkner said, the high volume of trading leads to big potential damages.  The first hint of investor losses will come in about two months, when shareholders file briefs vying to lead the fraud litigation against Tesla. Typically, under the 1995 law governing private securities class actions, federal judges appoint the shareholder or group of shareholders with the biggest losses to head up the case. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers use a variety of methodologies to calculate damages so it will be interesting to see their assessment of how Musk\u2019s tweet affected share price.  It will also be interesting to see which Tesla investors end up bidding to lead the litigation. The two who have so far filed suits are relatively small investors. One spent about $1 million in Tesla share purchases after Musk\u2019s tweets, the other, about $500,000. But shareholders now have two months to decide whether to compete to be in charge of the case. Lenkner said his firm is in discussions with hedge funds that had larger short positions in Tesla and bought shares to cover a portion of their shorts in the initial run-up following Musk\u2019s tweet.  \u201cHedge funds that might normally be hesitant to sign up as a lead plaintiff might look at this and see there\u2019s something there,\u201d Lenkner said.

Musk has played up the support Tesla is getting from Chinese authorities as the company invests in the country\u2019s first wholly foreign-owned car plant in Shanghai, due to come online later this year.  Until then, Tesla has to import U.S.-made cars with substantial customs duties, putting it at a disadvantage against locally-made, government-subsidized electric vehicles from rivals such as Nio Inc, Byton and XPeng Motors.  Financial publication Caixin had first reported about China\u2019s customs authorities blocking the cars.  A total of 1,171 Model 3 sedans arrived at north China's Tianjin Port, after 84 such cars were imported via the port in February, China's state news agency Xinhua reported here on Tuesday.  The first shipment of Model 3 cars arrived in Shanghai on Feb. 22, and deliveries started at the end of the month, according to media here reports.  Tesla\u2019s Shanghai factory, made possible by raising funds from local banks at low interest rates, plans to start making Model 3s at the end of this year and eventually produce cars at a rate of 10,000 per week.  Tesla has cut prices in China several times in the last few months to make its cars \u201cmore affordable\u201d and revive sales hit by Sino-U.S. trade tensions.  To cut costs and support its drive to generate profit, Tesla last week launched a $35,000 version of its Model 3 sedan and said its global sales would now be online-only.","622":"BERLIN, Feb 20 (Reuters) - A German court ruled on Thursday that Tesla Inc can continue to clear forest near the capital Berlin to build its first European car and battery factory, in a defeat for local environmental activists.

REUTERS\/Edgard Garrido  SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean supplier of Tesla Inc said on Friday it had agreed to buy a shuttered auto factory from General Motors\u2019 local unit to start contract manufacturing of electric vehicles.  The deal comes after GM closed one of its four South Korean plants in late May and let go thousands of workers, as part of a global restructuring drive which culminated in a major financial support package from the South Korean government.  GM did not disclose the sales price of the Gunsan factory, but auto parts maker Myongshin said it would buy the land and buildings of the GM facility for 113 billion won ($99.5 million)on June 28.  Myongshin, also a Hyundai Motor supplier, is part of a consortium which would initially spend a total of 200 billion won on the factory to produce 50,000 EVs starting 2021 and 150,000 EVs in 2025, according to a statement by a provincial government.  \u201cWe aim to close this deal as soon as possible to ensure that there will be ongoing economic activity,\u201d GM Korea said in a statement.

The U.S. automaker, which started delivering Model 3 electric sedans from its Shanghai factory in December, plans to add lines to make more battery packs, electric motors, and motor controllers, according to the document submitted by Tesla to Shanghai government.  Tesla, which as of end-December used about 70% imported parts for the cars it made in China, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.  But according to the document, Tesla wants to almost double its annual building capacity for cooling pipes, a key part in a car\u2019s heat management system, to 260,000 sets a year from 150,000. It did not provide capacity details for other parts.  The planned production line will not include battery cell manufacturing but will package out-sourced battery cells at the plant, the document said.  Tesla has previously said it wants to localize its entire supply chain in China by the end of this year.  The company is also building an additional stamping line to speed up car production in Shanghai, according to construction documents seen by Reuters.

Upbeat earnings from Microsoft and Mercedes maker Daimler, along with a ceasefire in northern Syria had also lifted the mood, though trade and Brexit uncertainties and some below-par German data prevented more sizable gains.

The case comes as Tesla has struggled to ramp up production of the Model 3, a sedan intended for volume production that is key to the company achieving long-term profitability.  Edris Rodriguez Ritchie, an attorney for the NLRB, said Tesla asked workers to sign confidentiality agreements that were \u201coverly broad\u201d in preventing them from publicly discussing their working conditions.  Tesla has denied the allegations and described them as an effort to make Chief Executive Elon Musk look bad.

The spotlight remained on bitcoin as it reached a record above $47,000, building on a nearly 20% surge overnight that was the biggest since 2017, after Tesla Inc announced a $1.5 billion investment in the digital asset. The dollar index weakened 0.2% to 90.75 in the Asian session, and dipped to 90.963 for the first time since Feb. 1. The U.S. currency has been in retreat since Friday, when disappointing jobs data knocked the wind out of a two-week run that had lifted it to a more than two-month high of 91.6.

FILE PHOTO: A Panasonic Corp's lithium-ion battery is pictured with the Tesla Motors logo during a photo opportunity at the Panasonic Center in Tokyo, Japan, November 19, 2013. REUTERS\/Yuya Shino  This is the first time Panasonic, a leading cell provider for the world\u2019s top electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla, has outlined these targets, putting down a marker in a highly competitive sector to stay ahead of the game.  Panasonic introduced the \u201c2170\u201d lithium-ion cells, with the nickel-cobalt-aluminium (NCA) cathode chemistry, for Tesla\u2019s Model 3 in 2017. Researchers say it already has the highest energy density at above 700 watt-hour per litre.  With an even higher density, these cells could help increase how much an EV can run on a single charge, while also paving the way for smaller batteries and roomier car interiors.  A cobalt-free version on the other hand would cut reliance on a costly and controversial component, which makes batteries stable but poses ethical issues given controversial labour conditions in top producer the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk has long said he wants to move to zero-cobalt battery cells.  Panasonic has already cut cobalt content to under 5% in the NCA cathode and plans to improve its batteries in stages, its U.S. EV battery chief Yasuaki Takamoto told Reuters.  But the firm has declined to link its battery roadmap to Tesla\u2019s future models.  Panasonic recently lost its status as Tesla's exclusive battery supplier. The U.S. firm has partnered with South Korea's LG Chem 051910.KS and China's CATL 300750.SZ.  CATL is supplying Tesla with low-cost lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries that contain no cobalt.  According to Takamoto, the average density of LFP battery cells is less than half the level of Panasonic\u2019s latest NCA batteries. He did not name any companies.  \u20182170\u2019 CELLS  Panasonic has already developed technologies resulting in a more than 5% increase in the energy density of \u201c2170\u201d cells.  From September, the firm will start converting lines at its factory in Nevada that it operates with Tesla as it prepares to further boost the energy density of the cells, Takamoto said.  To control safety risks associated with higher density and less cobalt, Panasonic is adjusting the composition and design for better thermal stability, Takamoto said.  He also noted there will be various battery requirements coming into play as EV usage diversifies.  Tesla\u2019s Musk has promised to reveal significant battery advances during a \u201cBattery Day\u201d presentation scheduled for Sept 22. Tesla plans to introduce an EV battery that will last one million miles later this year or early next, which it jointly developed with CATL.","649":"FILE PHOTO: A Tesla super charger is shown at one of the company's charging stations in San Juan Capistrano, California, U.S., May 30, 2018.

The SEC on Thursday filed a lawsuit against Musk accusing him of fraud and sought to remove him from his role saying he made a series of \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d tweets about potentially taking the company private.  Shares of Tesla dived 11 percent on Friday as Wall Street worried the lawsuit could force Musk to step down and make it difficult for the loss-making carmaker to raise more capital.

Short-sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price. Tesla is the most shorted U.S. stock.  Until Wednesday, Tesla short-sellers had, on paper, been up $276 million for the year.

Tesla shares rallied $48.70 to $349.54 a day after the manufacturer said it would produce its new Model 3 sedan at a profit, following several recent weeks in which output had stabilized.  The update buoyed hopes that the company led by Elon Musk will stanch its losses.  Tesla\u2019s rapid cash burn and struggles at turning a profit have made it a favorite target for shorts, including big names such as Jim Chanos, head of Kynikos Associates, and billionaire hedge fund manager David Einhorn\u2019s Greenlight Capital fund.  Since the beginning of 2016, Tesla is the fourth-worst performing U.S. short bet, and short-sellers have lost $4.70 billion on a net basis over that period, according to S3 data.  A sharp rally in the electric car maker\u2019s shares since early April has hurt short-sellers.

Another source said LG Chem agreed to supply batteries for Tesla\u2019s China plant, without elaborating.  LG Chem is expanding its China battery capacities and modifying some manufacturing facilities in Nanjing to make a different type of auto battery, according to the first source.  The company currently mainly makes pouch-type auto batteries, but as a major battery maker, it is not hard for it to revamp facilities to make cylindrical auto batteries that Tesla uses, the source and separate people familiar with the matter added.  The source said Tesla is still likely to use Panasonic batteries in the initial phase of production and source from other suppliers including local names in the future.  A third person said Tesla may source batteries from CATL 300750.SZ later, as the Chinese battery maker does not have much experience in making cylindrical batteries used by Tesla.  All of the sources declined to be identified because of the confidentiality of the deal.  Tesla did not immediately respond to Reuters\u2019 request for comment.

The day's jump increased Tesla's stock market value by $30 billion, eclipsing the entire value of Ford Motor Co F.N, currently at $25 billion.  JMP Securities increased its price target to $1,500 from $1,050 after Tesla on Thursday reported higher-than-expected second-quarter vehicle deliveries, defying plummeting sales in the wider auto industry as the coronavirus pandemic slammed the global economy.  \u201cWe believe that the question to be considered is not whether the stock is expensive on current valuation measures, but what the company\u2019s growth and competitive position signal about the stock\u2019s potential for the next several years,\u201d JMP Securities analyst Joseph Osha wrote in a client note. Tesla\u2019s annual sales could hit $100 billion by 2025, he predicted.

The milestone comes less than a month after Tesla\u2019s stock crossed $420, the infamous price at which Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk had tweeted he would take the electric car maker private.  Musk tweeted he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private in August 2018, when its shares were trading in the mid-$330s, only to later give up under investor pressure and regulatory concerns.  Tesla shares were last up 1.4% at $555 after the bell, building on a 7.2% gain during trading when brokerage New Street Research raised its price target to $800.  Tesla\u2019s market value also puts Musk a step closer to earning the first $346 million tranche of options in a record-breaking pay package.  The $100 billion valuation needs to stay for both a one-month and six-month average in order to trigger the vesting of the first of 12 tranches of options granted to Musk to buy Tesla stock.  Tesla, which is already valued more than Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co combined, has seen its stock more than double in the last three months, fueled by a rare quarterly profit in October, news of production ramp-up in its China factory and better-than-expected annual car deliveries.

REUTERS\/Denis Balibouse\/File Photo  Zetsche, who bows out as CEO on May 22, said the German luxury carmaker needed to find a way to rebuild margins after research and development (R&D) costs at Mercedes-Benz ballooned.  \u201cThere are many challenges ahead. We are in a situation of an economic slowdown. It is not going to be easier going forward,\u201d he said on the sidelines of the launch event near Oslo.  Pressure to develop electric and autonomous cars has led R&D costs at Mercedes-Benz passenger cars to rise to 14 billion euros ($15.7 billion) from around 8 billion euros four years ago, Zetsche said.  At the same time, China, the world\u2019s largest car market, has seen sales momentum slowing for nine months in a row, with a 5.2 percent fall in sales in March.  Mercedes-Benz\u2019s large electric car will hit showrooms this summer, years after Tesla launched its Model S in 2012.  Daimler has been cautious about embracing mass production of electric vehicles at Mercedes-Benz amid concerns about operating range and customer acceptance.  The company took a 9.1 percent stake in Tesla for around $50 million in May 2009 to learn about battery technology, but sold its stake for a $780 million profit in 2014.  Daimler launched an electric car under the smart brand in 2010, but waited until 2014 to build an electric Mercedes-Benz B-Class.  Daimler, like other manufacturers, has struggled to make electric cars profitable, although the cost of battery packs is expected to fall as they invest in ramping up battery cell production.  ING analysts say the total cost of ownership, including fuel prices, could reach parity between electric and combustion engined vehicles by 2025.  In an effort to make a profit with electric cars, Daimler has opted to manufacture the Mercedes EQC in a way that enables it to be built on the same production line as a combustion engined car, retooling existing plants.  Daimler is investing more than 10 billion euros to expand the electric EQ model range and is building battery cell production facilities.  The Mercedes EQC will have an operating range of 445-471 kms, with a base version costing below 60,000 euros to make it eligible for Germany\u2019s electric car environmental bonus.  Asked whether Daimler was too late to the electric vehicle trend, Zetsche said: \u201cFor the past 40 years I have heard that German manufacturers have missed all the important trends. But apparently customers still like cars from manufacturers that have missed the boat.\u201d  Zetsche took over as CEO of DaimlerChrysler in 2006 and took the decision to sell Chrysler, returning Mercedes to the top selling luxury brand globally in 2016 and defending the title ever since.  Zetsche said Daimler\u2019s future hinged on making electric cars profitably.  \u201cWe need to prove that we can earn adequate margins, and the capital market wants to proof points. We are working on making this a reality.\u201d","668":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc and Chief Executive Elon Musk were sued twice on Friday by investors who said they fraudulently engineered a scheme to squeeze short-sellers, including through Musk\u2019s proposal to take the electric car company private.  The lawsuits were filed three days after Musk stunned investors by announcing on Twitter that he might take Tesla private in a record $72 billion transaction that valued the company at $420 per share, and that \u201cfunding\u201d had been \u201csecured.\u201d  In one of the lawsuits, the plaintiff Kalman Isaacs said Musk\u2019s tweets were false and misleading, and together with Tesla\u2019s failure to correct them amounted to a \u201cnuclear attack\u201d designed to \u201ccompletely decimate\u201d short-sellers.  The lawsuits filed by Isaacs and William Chamberlain said Musk\u2019s and Tesla\u2019s conduct artificially inflated Tesla\u2019s stock price and violated federal securities laws.  Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on the proposed class-action complaints filed in the federal court in San Francisco. The company is based in nearby Palo Alto, California.  Short-sellers borrow shares they believe are overpriced, sell them, and then repurchase shares later at what they hope will be a lower price to make a profit.  Such investors have long been an irritant for Musk, who has sometimes used Twitter to criticize them.  Musk\u2019s Aug. 7 tweets helped push Tesla\u2019s stock price more than 13 percent above the prior day\u2019s close.  The stock has since given back more than two-thirds of that gain, in part following reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had begun inquiring about Musk\u2019s activity.  Musk has not offered evidence that he has lined up the necessary funding to take Tesla private, and the complaints did not offer proof to the contrary.  But Isaacs said Tesla\u2019s and Musk\u2019s conduct caused the volatility that cost short-sellers hundreds of millions of dollars from having to cover their short positions, and caused all Tesla securities purchasers to pay inflated prices.  Tesla\u2019s market value exceeds $60 billion, and its shares closed Friday up $3.04 at $355.49.  According to his complaint, Isaacs bought 3,000 Tesla shares on Aug. 8 to cover his short position.  The proposed class period in Isaacs\u2019 lawsuit runs from the afternoon of Aug. 7 through the next day, and in Chamberlain\u2019s lawsuit runs from Aug. 7 to Aug. 10.  The cases are Isaacs v Musk et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-04865; and Chamberlain v Tesla Inc et al in the same court, No. 18-04876.","669":"(Updates to add Jim Keller\u2019s departure in April)  May 15 (Reuters) - Electric carmaker Tesla Inc has seen a flurry of senior executive exits in recent months at a time when the company is looking to speed up production of its Model 3 sedan, a mid-market car crucial to its success and future profitability, and developing multiple new vehicles, including a Semi truck.

Tesla Inc appears on the verge of joining the S&P 500, a major accomplishment for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk that would unleash a flood of new demand for the electric car maker\u2019s shares, which have already surged 500% over the past year.  Higher-than-expected second-quarter vehicle deliveries, announced last week, have analysts increasingly confident the company will show a profit in its quarterly report on July 22. That would mark Tesla\u2019s first cumulative four-quarter profit, a key hurdle to be added to the S&P 500.  With a market capitalization of about $250 billion, Tesla would be among the most valuable companies ever added to the S&P 500, larger than 95% of the index\u2019s existing components. It would have a major impact on investment funds that track the index.  For a graphic on Tesla potentially in the S&P 500:  While analysts and investors have recently become more confident of Tesla\u2019s addition, an S&P Dow Jones spokeswoman declined to comment about specific changes to the index.  Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones, had to look back to the dot-com era to recall a comparable situation. In 1999, Yahoo surged 64% in five trading days between the announcement that it would be added to the index on Nov. 30 and its inclusion after the close of trading on Dec. 7. Yahoo\u2019s market capitalization at the time was about $56 billion.  FILE PHOTO: Tesla electric vehicles for test driving are parked in Hanam, South Korea, July 6, 2020. REUTERS\/Kim Hong-Ji  For a graphic on Yahoo's 1999 S&P 500 debut: tmsnrt.rs\/3iOlA8o  \u201cThe lesson learned from Yahoo was that when you have an up and coming issue that may possibly go into the index, you should already own a little of it,\u201d said Silverblatt. \u201cIf you had to get into that stock, you were paying a heck of a premium compared to owning it a week earlier.\u201d  Funds that attempt to identically track the S&P 500 have at least $4.4 trillion of assets, according to S&P Dow Jones, and those funds would need to buy Tesla shares quickly to avoid errors tracking the index\u2019s performance.  Ivan Cajic, head of index & ETF research at Virtu Financial estimates index managers would need to own roughly 25 million shares of Tesla stock, currently worth $34 billion.  \u201cYou have all the index funds that have no choice but to include it,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. \u201cThat is one reason why it has been so strong here, in anticipation of that.\u201d  Additionally, actively managed investment funds that benchmark their performance to the S&P 500 will be forced to decide whether to buy Tesla shares. Such funds manage trillions of dollars in additional assets.  \u201cEven if you don\u2019t like Tesla and you think it\u2019s overvalued, the fact that it is going into the index would mean trillions of dollars would have some kind of position,\u201d said Jim Bianco, head of Bianco Research in Chicago. \u201cAs part of their benchmark, portfolio managers would not be able to ignore it.\u201d  Up 43% in just the past eight sessions, Tesla is among the most loved - and hated - stocks on Wall Street. It is the U.S. stock market\u2019s purest play bet on the rise of renewable energy and the decline of fossil fuels, and Tesla\u2019s Model 3 sedan has made major inroads among consumers.  For a graphic on As Tesla rallies, short bets hit record levels:  However, short sellers are betting $19 billion that Tesla\u2019s shares will fall, the largest short level on record for a U.S. company, in dollars, according to S3 Partners.  Bears point to looming competition from Porsche, General Motors and other longer-established rivals. They are also skeptical of Tesla\u2019s corporate governance under Musk, who in 2018 agreed to pay $20 million and step down as chairman to settle fraud charges.  Traders betting Tesla could be added to the S&P 500 have almost certainly contributed to the recent rally. However, Bianco warned that the stock could reverse if Tesla is not added to the S&P 500.","671":"A trader looks up at a chart on his computer screen while working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the market opening in New York on July 11, 2013. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tesla is getting a lesson in buyout realities. Elon Musk\u2019s stated desire to take the money-losing carmaker private has set Wall Street all atwitter. But Dun & Bradstreet\u2019s $5.4 billion leveraged buyout, announced on Thursday, is a reminder of what it usually takes: a mature, mediocre, profitable firm. That\u2019s a better bet than capital-draining dreams of domination.  Dun & Bradstreet has been in business for more than 175 years, but has barely grown in a decade. Indeed, this stagnation was one reason the company\u2019s former chief executive, Robert Carrigan, left earlier this year. Yet the firm\u2019s business of tracking and analyzing corporate credit and risk remains a mainstay for clients and will for many years to come.  This stability, and the fact the business doesn\u2019t require a huge amount of capital, is attractive to buyers CC Capital, Cannae Holdings and funds affiliated with T.H. Lee. The company should have just under $400 million of net operating profit after tax next year, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S. That\u2019s about a 6 percent return, which isn\u2019t particularly interesting. But throw in some cost cuts, and even minor growth, and the potential gains become more palatable, especially considering the firm\u2019s stability means it can take a lot of leverage.  Now compare that to Tesla. The 15-year old company makes some very attractive cars, but not a profit \u2013 though Musk has been saying that\u2019ll happen by the end of this year. Plans to expand autos, trucks, solar power and power storage will require massive investment to compete against giant multinationals with lots of production experience. And much of the firm\u2019s value seemingly resides in the mercurial Musk, who also devotes his attention to trying to colonize space and burrowing under the earth.  Moreover, buyouts are inherently risky for even the best dealmakers. CC Capital, for example, was founded by Chinh Chu after he spent 25 highly profitable years at Blackstone. Yet one of this shop\u2019s first purchases was a company called Constellation Healthcare Technologies. It went bust this year and regulators charged CHT\u2019s former executives with falsifying documents to sell the company.  When it comes to buyouts, boring, reliable and trustworthy are the big draws.","672":"BOSTON (Reuters) - Information about Elon Musk's efforts to take Tesla Inc TSLA.O private is scarce. But some small investors wonder if top funds have an edge.  FILE PHOTO: Tesla Motors Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk pauses during a news conference in Tokyo September 8, 2014. REUTERS\/Toru Hanai\/File Photo  In a blog post on Monday bit.ly\/2Oy3vLE, the Tesla chief executive said he would sound out some of his largest shareholders on the idea. The list could include T. Rowe Price Group Inc TROW.O and Fidelity Investments, which each have had a good run with the stock.  Some stockholders worry the meetings could yield details not available to smaller investors, a tension that is emerging more often as big funds own larger stakes in companies and stress their frequent talks with U.S. corporations.  Some small investors say they do not expect a level informational playing field when it comes to Tesla, whose shares have been whipsawed by Musk\u2019s unpredictable tweets.  Adam Grossman, principal of Mayport Wealth Management in Newton, Massachusetts said he has avoided owning Tesla for clients except through indexes, partly to limit the risk of missing out on color Musk could share with a small circle.  \u201cIf you\u2019re a big portfolio manager and able to sit in a room with Elon Musk, you\u2019ll pick up information\u201d not available to others, Grossman said in an interview on Thursday.  Practically, small investors are going to be left out of the loop by Musk\u2019s outreach, said Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer of investment manager KraneShares, with an estimated several thousand Tesla shares.  Big funds speaking with Musk \u201care going to be getting the proverbial keys to the kingdom, and others are on the outside,\u201d Ahern said.  A Tesla spokesman did not comment for this article.  Musk said in his blog he needed to be forthcoming with top shareholders about his plans to take Tesla private at $420 per share. \u201cHowever, it wouldn\u2019t be right to share information about going private with just our largest investors without sharing the same information with all investors at the same time,\u201d he wrote, leading to his public announcement of his intentions.  A plan would also need regulatory and shareholder approval, Musk wrote.  Harvard Law School professor John Coates said U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules on fair disclosure allow the selective sharing of some details if recipients agree not to trade until what they are told becomes public. But it is hard to know how those limits might play out for Musk\u2019s outreach.  \u201cWith Tesla however nothing normal is normal. So who knows,\u201d Coates said via email.  This month is not the first time Musk has lifted the curtain on his talks with top holders. In June 2016 Musk mentioned talking with institutions about combining Tesla and SolarCity Corp, [SCTY.N] a deal that came together later that year. reut.rs\/2nGAFgN  Representatives for Fidelity and T. Rowe Price declined to comment. Neither firm has shared its thinking about Musk\u2019s take-private idea or said much to explain their second-quarter share sales. Collectively T Rowe funds cut their Tesla stakes by 24 percent to 11.9 million shares at June 30, while Fidelity funds cut their stakes 21 percent to 11.2 million at the same point, filings show.  Unlike index funds that would likely have to sell a privatized Tesla, both big firms run funds with big stakes in closely held companies.  To be sure, not all of Tesla\u2019s smaller investors are concerned about Musk sharing details selectively. Louis Albanese, managing partner of Catamount Wealth Management, with about 8,000 Tesla shares, said the key is that all shareholders eventually receive the same buyout offer, as he expects.  \u201cIt\u2019s not like these guys are going to get $420 (per share), and everybody else gets $350,\u201d Albanese said.","673":"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk on Tuesday landed a deal with Chinese authorities to build a new auto plant in Shanghai, its first factory outside the United States, that would double the size of the electric car maker's global manufacturing.  The deal was announced as Tesla raised prices on U.S.-made vehicles it sells in China to offset the cost of new tariffs imposed by the Chinese government in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s heavier duties on Chinese goods.  Musk was in Shanghai Tuesday, and the Shanghai government in a statement said it welcomed Tesla\u2019s move to invest not only in a new factory in the city, a center of the Chinese auto industry, but in research and development, as well. China has long pushed to capture more of the talent and capital invested by global automakers in advanced electric vehicle technology.  Tesla plans to produce the first cars about two years after construction begins on its Shanghai factory, ramping up to as many as 500,000 vehicles a year about two to three years later, the company said.  That would make Tesla\u2019s Shanghai plant large by auto industry standards, where most factories are tooled to build 200,000 to 300,000 vehicles a year, and roughly equivalent to the planned annual production at Tesla\u2019s plant in Fremont, California.  Tesla shares rose 1.5 percent in U.S. trading even as some analysts questioned where the money-losing company will get the capital required to build and staff such a large plant.  Musk has said Tesla will be cash-flow positive this year. Analysts have predicted it will raise capital to fund a list of new projects, including launching an electric semi truck, a pickup truck, a compact SUV and new battery and vehicle production facilities that Musk has proposed for China and Europe.  \u201cI am sure that Tesla needs fresh money at the latest next year,\u201d said Frank Schwope, an analyst with NORD\/LB.  The Shanghai government suggested it could help with some of the capital costs. \u201cThe Shanghai municipal government will fully support the construction of the Tesla factory,\u201d its statement said.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Tesla said Tuesday\u2019s announcement will not impact U.S. manufacturing operations, which continue to grow.  MUSK\u2019S PURSUIT OF A CHINA PLANT  China is the largest market for electric vehicles, and most forecasters predict that electric vehicle sales in the country will accelerate rapidly as government regulation drives toward a goal of 100-percent electric vehicles by 2030.  More than 28 million vehicles were sold in China last year, and annual sales are forecast to top 35 million by 2025. That would be more than double the current U.S. market, where new light vehicle sales run at about 17 million vehicles a year.  Musk was talking about building a Chinese factory long before the Trump administration proposed punitive tariffs on Chinese goods. China until recently levied 25-percent tariffs on imported cars, and for decades automakers have been moving to build more vehicles in the markets where they are sold to neutralize currency shifts and trade policy reversals.  Chinese authorities' decision to grant Tesla permission to move forward lands as President Trump is fighting to stop U.S. manufacturers from responding to his trade policy by shifting production overseas, as U.S. motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc HOG.N said it would do last month.  Against the backdrop of trade conflict with Washington, China is using its power to draw investment from the global auto industry. German automakers on Monday and Tuesday dominated a list of deals between China and Germany focused on the development of electric vehicles and technology for connectivity and self-driving cars.  BMW BMWG.DE agreed with partner Brilliance Automotive Group Holdings 1114.HK to up production capacity at joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive to 520,000 BMW brand vehicles in 2019.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Capacity at BMW Brilliance Automotive\u2019s (BBA) two production sites will outstrip BMW\u2019s U.S. plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, for the first time. BMW said last week it would be unable to fully absorb a new Chinese 25-percent tariff on imported U.S.-made models and would have to raise prices on the vehicles it makes in Spartanburg.  Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, meanwhile, said it will cooperate with China's FAW Group 000800.SZ on technologies including e-mobility, connectivity and autonomous cars.  Tesla has been in protracted negotiations to open its own factory in China to help bolster its position in the country\u2019s fast-growing market for electric cars and to avoid high import tariffs.  Tesla hiked prices in China over the weekend to a level more than 70 percent higher than in the United States amid mounting trade frictions between Washington and Beijing that have seen several U.S. imports, including cars, subjected to retaliatory tariffs of 25 percent.  Musk had previously criticized China\u2019s tough auto rules for foreign businesses, which would have required it to cede a 50-percent share in the factory. After China announced in May that it planned to scrap by 2022 the rules on capping foreign ownership of new-energy vehicle ventures, Tesla registered a new electric car firm in Shanghai.  \u201cThe Shanghai plant will certainly improve Tesla\u2019s positioning in China and allow it to locally produce and avoid import tariffs. The relaxation of the 50\/50 rule for JVs in China uniquely benefits Tesla because they did not have an existing JV in China\u201d as rivals do, said Tasha Keeney, an analyst with ARK Invest.","674":"Jan 21 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc has reached a settlement with Michigan to allow the electric carmaker to directly sell vehicles in the state, a person familiar with the agreement said on Tuesday.

FILE PHOTO: Tesla CEO Elon Musk arrives at Manhattan federal court for a hearing on his fraud settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in New York City, U.S., April 4, 2019. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  The SEC had asked U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan to hold Musk in contempt over a Feb. 19 tweet in which the agency said he had improperly posted material information about Tesla\u2019s vehicle production outlook without first seeking approval from its lawyers.  In an order on Friday, the judge gave both sides until April 18 to reach a resolution. If they do not, the judge said she would decide whether to hold Musk in contempt. If he is held in contempt, the judge will allow the parties to weigh in on possible sanctions.  The case has high stakes for Tesla.  When the SEC initially sued Musk in September, it had asked for his removal. The two sides settled in October, with Musk agreeing to step down as Tesla\u2019s chairman. The agreement also called for pre-approval of Musk\u2019s written communications that could be material to the company.  At a court hearing on Thursday, the SEC suggested that greater oversight of Musk\u2019s communications, including the threat of new fines if he backslides, would be an adequate remedy.  \u201cThis was a warning. I don\u2019t think he gets a second warning,\u201d said Marc Leaf, a former SEC lawyer in New York.  In a statement on Thursday, Musk stood by his actions.  \u201cI have great respect for Judge Nathan, and I\u2019m pleased with her decision today. The tweet in question was true, immaterial to shareholders, and in no way a violation of my agreement,\u201d he said in the statement released by Tesla.  The October settlement resolved a lawsuit over a tweet last Aug. 7 in which Musk said he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private at $420 per share.  The Feb. 19 tweet said: \u201cTesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019,\u201d meaning 500,000 vehicles. Four hours later Musk corrected himself, saying annualized production would be \u201cprobably around\u201d 500,000 by year end, with full-year deliveries totaling about 400,000.  The SEC said the first of the Feb. 19 tweets conflicted with Tesla\u2019s Jan. 30 outlook, when it targeted annualized Model 3 production exceeding 500,000 as soon as the fourth quarter, and projected 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries this year.  At the time the SEC also said that Musk had violated their agreement by sending a tweet that had not been vetted by Tesla\u2019s lawyers and he should be held in contempt. It did not say what penalties it wanted imposed, raising the question of whether it would again seek his removal or propose lesser measures.  Musk\u2019s lawyers countered that the first Feb. 19 tweet contained nothing new, and that the SEC had conceded during settlement talks that Musk did not need pre-approval for all tweets about Tesla.","678":"FILE PHOTO - Elon Musk, founder, CEO and lead designer at SpaceX and co-founder of Tesla, speaks at the International Space Station Research and Development Conference in Washington, U.S., July 19, 2017.

Tel Aviv-based Cortica says its technology enables self-driving cars to identify moving parts in its environment and make informed decisions, even predicting changes likely to occur in its surroundings.  The Globes financial news website said the discussions with Cortica could lead to an investment or even an acquisition. Officials at Cortica could not be reached for comment.  Cortica has raised nearly $70 million since it was founded in 2007. Investors include Hong Kong-based Horizons Ventures and Russia's Mail.ru Group MAILRq.L, according to Start-Up National Central.  Tesla previously collaborated with Israeli company Mobileye but the companies parted ways in 2016 after a fatal crash involving a Tesla Model S using Autopilot, a semi-automated system designed to assist with driving but not replace the driver.  Intel INTC.O acquired Mobileye last year for $15.3 billion.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday he had met Musk and that they discussed the potential of solar energy generation in the Negev desert.  Musk\u2019s visit to Israel was highlighted by several websites, including Globes, after he posted a video of himself on Instagram at a bar in Jerusalem.","679":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said on Sunday it was \"unhappy\" that electric car maker Tesla Inc TSLA.O made public information about the crash of its Model X vehicle on Autopilot that killed the driver last month.

A Tesla spokesperson declined to comment.  The board\u2019s reaction to Tesla was first reported by the Washington Post Sunday evening.  O\u2019Neil was responding to Tesla\u2019s announcement on Friday that the Tesla Model X involved in the crash had activated its Autopilot system moments before the March 23 mishap.  The driver, 38, died at a nearby hospital shortly after the vehicle hit a concrete highway divider near Mountain View, California. The mishap involved two other vehicles.  \u201cThe NTSB is looking into all aspects of this crash including the driver\u2019s previous concerns about the autopilot,\u201d said O\u2019Neil. \u201cWe will work to determine the probable cause of the crash and our next update of information about our investigation will likely be when we publish a preliminary report, which generally occurs within a few weeks of completion of field work.\u201d  Last week, the company said that a search of its service records did not \u201cfind anything suggesting that the customer ever complained to Tesla about the performance of Autopilot. There was a concern raised once about navigation not working correctly, but Autopilot\u2019s performance is unrelated to navigation.\u201d  In its announcement on Friday, the company said that shortly before the crash, the vehicle\u2019s \u201cAutopilot was engaged with the adaptive cruise control follow-distance set to minimum.\u201d  Autopilot allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel for extended periods under certain conditions. Tesla requires users to agree to keep their hands on the wheel at all times before they can use Autopilot. Users, however, routinely brag they can use the system to drive hands-free.  In its Friday statement, Tesla also said vehicle logs from the accident showed no action had been taken by the driver right before the crash and that he had received earlier warnings to put his hands on the wheel.  The statement did not say why the Autopilot system apparently did not detect the concrete divider.","680":"* Dollar index little changed after Friday payrolls fall * Jobs data takes shine off dollar rebound * Ethereum gains on futures debut * Bitcoin hits record high after Tesla purchase * Graphic: World FX rates tmsnrt.rs\/2RBWI5E (Adds details on Bitcoin, updates prices) By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, Feb 8 (Reuters) - The dollar was flat to slightly higher on Monday in choppy trading after falling sharply on disappointing U.S. jobs data last week, as investors continued to see a faster U.S. recovery than in most countries and were also focused on rallying crypto currencies after Tesla announced a $1.5 billion investment in bitcoin. The dollar index was at 91.033,, up 0.05% on the day. On Friday, it fell as low as 90.981 after data showed the U.S. economy created fewer jobs than expected in January and job losses in December were greater than initially reported. \"We view Friday's non-farm payrolls report as a speed bump rather than a roadblock for the emerging growth divergence narrative,\" Mark McCormick, global head of FX strategy at TD Securities in Toronto, said in a research note. \"Stepping back from this single report, we still see growth expectations moving in the U.S.' favor, especially versus Europe. Since the end of the first lockdowns last year, the U.S., Japan, and Canada are the lone G10 countries to have seen growth expectations rise for next year,\" he added. Speculators have been reducing short positions - bets the dollar will weaken - on the currency. Some analysts have flagged the likelihood that the same speculators will be forced out of their short positions by a rise in the dollar. Net bearish bets on the dollar by speculators fell to $29.95 billion for the week ended Feb. 2, compared with a net short position of $33.81 billion for the previous week, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. Francesco Pesole, FX strategist at ING, said that even if the U.S. dollar recovery stalls, \"we could continue to see evidence of a USD short squeeze in the coming weeks.\" The euro was down modestly at $1.2037 against the dollar. In a note to clients, J.P. Morgan strategists said they \"have growing confidence of underperformance of EUR vs USD.\" Investor morale in the euro zone unexpectedly fell in February as lockdowns to suppress the COVID-19 caseload left their mark on the economy, which lost touch with other regions in the world as they recovered further, a survey by Sentix showed. Sentix's investor sentiment index for the euro zone fell into negative territory, dropping to -0.2 from 1.3 in January. A Reuters poll had pointed to a reading of 1.9. The British pound bought $1.3732, little changed against the dollar. The dollar was quoted at 105.215 yen, having pulled back from a three-month high reached on Friday. In the cryptocurrency market, bitcoin hit another record high of $44,899 after Tesla Inc said on Monday it had invested around $1.5 billion in the virtual currency and expects to begin accepting payment with it for its cars and other products in the near future.. Bitcoin was last up 11.7% at 43,345. Ethereum hit a record high of $1,779.43 after the listing of futures for the cryptocurrency on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange late Sunday.

The Justice Department asked Tesla for documents about Musk\u2019s announcement, Tesla said, describing it as a \u201cvoluntary request.\u201d The company said it was co-operating and that the matter \u201cshould be quickly resolved.\u201d  The probe by the Justice Department, which can press criminal charges, comes on top of a civil probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission and shareholder lawsuits.  The Justice Department declined to comment. Bloomberg reported earlier that federal prosecutors had opened a criminal fraud investigation. Tesla did not say whether the Justice Department probe was criminal or civil.  Musk surprised investors on Aug. 7 with his plan to take Tesla private, tweeting that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d for a deal that would have valued the company at $72 billion. In a separate tweet, he wrote: \u201cInvestor support is confirmed.\u201d  Tesla\u2019s shares rose after his tweet, but investors in the company\u2019s bonds and convertible debt were skeptical that the tens of billions of dollars needed for the buyout would materialize.  After two weeks of uncertainty, particularly over funding, Musk abruptly abandoned the plan on Aug. 24, saying it would be even more time-consuming and distracting than anticipated, and that \u201cmost of Tesla\u2019s existing shareholders believe we are better off as a public company.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: Founder and CEO of Tesla Motors Elon Musk speaks during a media tour of the Tesla Gigafactory, which will produce batteries for the electric carmaker, in Sparks, Nevada, U.S. July 26, 2016. REUTERS\/James Glover II\/File Photo  Tesla\u2019s stock, which has lost about 25 percent since its gains after Musk first tweeted about going private, fell 3.5 percent to $284.50 on Tuesday.  The SEC has already opened an inquiry into Musk\u2019s tweets, according to one person with direct knowledge of the matter, and short-seller Citron Research has sued Musk over the truthfulness of his tweet about secured funding. The SEC has not commented on the case.  The SEC has in the past month sent subpoenas also to investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc and buyout firm Silver lake as they were hired by Tesla to explore the going-private deal, the New York Times said. [nyti.ms\/2NnLG66]  Goldman Sachs and Silver Lake did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Tesla biggest institutional investor Baillie Gifford said last week it was questioned by the SEC about Musk\u2019s plans to take the electric carmaker private. An executive with the asset manager said the chief executive needed help running the company.  STRONG GOVERNMENT CASE?  \u201cAny criminal investigation takes this up a level and creates more danger for the company and Musk,\u201d said Peter Henning, a lawyer who has worked for the SEC and the Justice Department.  To charge Musk with a crime, the Justice Department would need to show that he intended to manipulate Tesla\u2019s stock price, said Henning, now a law professor at Wayne State University.  For a civil enforcement action, the SEC would only need to show that Musk acted negligently, which is easier to prove, he said. The SEC could subject Musk to civil sanctions such as fines, relinquishing improper profits and a ban on running public companies.  If the Justice Department brings criminal charges against Musk and a trial results in a guilty verdict, the 47-year-old billionaire could face jail time, in addition to any financial penalties, said Jay Dubow, a former branch chief in the SEC\u2019s enforcement division.  Musk\u2019s public antipathy to short-sellers of Tesla - who have sold stock and hope to make a profit by buying it back for less later on - may help the government make the case that he intended to hurt them by claiming funding was secured, said Eric Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business.  \u201cMusk said \u2018funding secured,\u2019 which is not a prediction, but a statement in the past tense which seems like a fact, and this could be a strong case from the government side,\u201d said Gordon.  Musk\u2019s recent behavior, which included smoking marijuana during a video interview, has raised concerns about his leadership, with several Wall Street analysts and some investors urging Tesla to appoint a strong second-in-command.  He has been under intense pressure to prove he can deliver consistent production numbers for the Model 3 sedan, which is crucial to Tesla\u2019s plan to become a mass-market automaker.","682":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pretty much everyone on Wall Street has an opinion about Tesla TSLA.O.  FILE PHOTO: Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk walks next to a screen showing an image of Tesla Model 3 car during an opening ceremony for Tesla China-made Model Y program in Shanghai, China January 7, 2020. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  The electric vehicle maker\u2019s stupendous rally in recent months has given shareholders something to cheer about, cost short sellers billions of dollars and vindicated legions of retail investors who have long adored Elon Musk\u2019s company.  Tesla shares have soared by nearly 320% since early June, helped by the company\u2019s better-than-expected financial results and ramped-up production at its new car factory in Shanghai.  After surging 36% over Monday and Tuesday, the stock by Friday had settled back to a gain of about 15% for the week. On Friday afternoon, it was down marginally at $747.11.  Another factor driving this week\u2019s surge may be fund managers hurrying to raise their allocation of the stock, analysts said.  \u201cA lot of advisors and institutions, they jump in the bandwagon because they don\u2019t want to trail,\u201d said vocal Tesla bull Ross Gerber, president and chief executive of Gerber Kawasaki in Santa Monica, California. \u201cIf Tesla goes to $1,000 and they don\u2019t own it, what are they going to tell their clients?\u201d  Gerber trimmed his fund\u2019s position in the stock as the company\u2019s valuation soared. He hopes to buy more if the stock falls and said a fair valuation would be around $550.  THE BULLS  Retail investors have driven part of the surge.  Among Fidelity Investments customers, Tesla has been by far the most actively traded stock in recent sessions, with nearly 16,000 buy orders for the electric carmaker\u2019s shares. Twitter, ranked second overall in trading activity on Fidelity, had just over 2,000 buy orders.  On Monday, when Tesla shot up 20% in its biggest one day rally since 2013, clients at TD Ameritrade - millennials in particular - overwhelmingly took profits after having bought the stock for months, said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at the online brokerage.  Tesla\u2019s biggest institutional shareholders are Baillie Gifford, Capital World and Vanguard, according to Refinitiv data.  It also has an international following. Retail investors in South Korea have been trading Tesla shares at a furious pace in recent weeks, buying and selling $200 million worth of stock in January, according to the Korea Securities Depository. Volume in November stood at $43 million.  Tesla options positioning is also bullish. According to data from options analytics provider Trade Alert, skew turned deeply negative this week, meaning that demand for calls, used to position for further share gains, has surpassed demand for puts, used to guard against a fall in shares.  That\u2019s a departure from the usual dynamic in most stocks, in which options used for downside protection generally command prices higher than those for upside participation.  (Graphic: Investors rev up Tesla volatility bets - )  Tesla\u2019s biggest winner is Musk, who stands to earn more than $1 billion thanks to Tesla\u2019s recent rally. The company\u2019s market capitalization briefly exceeded $150 billion this week, the second target in his record-breaking compensation package that opens the way to options awarded to him vesting.  (Graphic: Elon's big payout - )  THE BEARS  Many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth. More Wall Street analysts rate Tesla \u201csell\u201d than \u201cbuy,\u201d and the company\u2019s stock is the most shorted on Wall Street, with nearly $18 billion sold short.  Those bearish investors plan to profit by selling borrowed shares and buying them back later at a lower price. Yet while short investors in Tesla have suffered paper losses of over $11 billion so far in 2020, they have mostly held their ground, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.  One seller in the December quarter was Saudi Arabia\u2019s public investment fund, according to a filing on Tuesday.  Some funds that reportedly hold short positions are London-based Crispin Odey, according to the Financial Times. Odey was not immediately available for comment.  The Financial Times also reported that Greenlight Capital, run by David Einhorn, had told investors last month it held a put option against Tesla, which would be a bet against the stock. A spokesman for Greenlight declined to comment.","683":"FILE PHOTO: Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk dances onstage during a delivery event for Tesla China-made Model 3 cars in Shanghai, China January 7, 2020.

The stock dropped 2.8 percent to $280.74, the lowest level since late May, following a 4.2 percent decline on Tuesday after Mercedes introduced its first fully electric car in Stockholm.  The $1.8 billion high-yield bond Tesla issued a year ago hit a record low price on Wednesday. It also became more expensive to insure Tesla\u2019s bonds against default.  Tesla\u2019s stock has lost a quarter of its value since Aug. 7, when Musk tweeted that he had secured funding for a previously undisclosed plan to take Tesla private.  Musk on Aug. 24 abandoned that plan, but he faces lawsuits and a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the factual accuracy of his tweet that funding for the deal was \u201csecured.\u201d The incident is weighing on investor confidence and has hurt the credibility of Musk, long viewed by Tesla supporters as its most valuable asset.  Also raising concerns about Musk\u2019s leadership and focus as Tesla struggles to increase production of its Model 3 mass market sedan, BuzzFeed News reported late on Tuesday that Musk, in an email to the news site, called British cave diver Vernon Unsworth a \u201cchild rapist.\u201d  Musk in July apologized to Unsworth for similar insults he made on Twitter following the rescue of a dozen Thai schoolboys and their football coach from a cave in Thailand.

A Tesla spokeswoman said Tesla\u2019s Model X SUV, as measured by the European system, has a range of 565 km (351 miles). Under stricter standards used by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Tesla\u2019s range is measured at 295 miles (475 km).  Falling prices for Tesla's bonds on Wednesday showed deepening concerns about the company's dwindling cash pile. Its $1.8 billion junk bond maturing in August 2025 88160RAE1= dropped more than a point in price to a record low 85.75 cents on the dollar.

Left, whose reports at Citron Research often push stock prices lower, said in his proposed class-action complaint on Thursday that Musk\u2019s issuance of materially false and misleading information harmed short-sellers like himself, as well as those hoping Tesla\u2019s stock price would rise.  The shareholder lawsuit is one of at least seven targeting Musk since he stunned investors by announcing on Twitter on Aug. 7 that he might take Tesla private for $420 per share, in a $72 billion transaction for which \u201cfunding\u201d had been \u201csecured.\u201d  That announcement drove Tesla\u2019s share price up more than 13 percent from its close the prior day. Musk announced on Aug. 24 that Tesla would stay public.  Tesla did not respond to requests for comment on Left\u2019s lawsuit, which was filed in San Francisco federal court.  Short-sellers borrow shares they believe are overpriced, sell them, and then repurchase shares later at what they hope will be lower prices to make profits.  Known as an activist investor, Left was among the first short-sellers to challenge Canadian drug company Valeant, which he called a \u201cpharmaceutical Enron\u201d after the failed energy company, before its stock price plunged amid worries about its business practices and regulatory probes.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Valeant is now called Bausch Health Companies Inc BHC.TO.  Musk has long used Twitter to criticize short-sellers, and Left said his conduct violated federal securities laws.  \u201cDefendant Musk artificially manipulated the price of Tesla securities with objectively false tweets in order to \u2018burn\u2019 the company\u2019s short-sellers,\u201d Left said.  \u201cIn the succeeding days, the truth regarding the supposedly \u2018secure\u2019 financing needed to effectuate the going-private transaction began to emerge, exposing the fraudulent scheme,\u201d he added.  The proposed class period runs from Aug. 7 to Aug. 17, over which time Left said he bought and sold many millions of dollars of Tesla shares.  That period ended after the New York Times published an interview in which Musk, who owns about one-fifth of Tesla, described severe stress he faced running the Palo Alto, California-based company.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Finally, on the evening of Aug. 24, a Friday, Musk, by then facing U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission scrutiny into the factual accuracy of his \"secured\" tweet, blogged here that Tesla would remain public, citing investor resistance.  \u201cThe sentiment, in a nutshell, was \u2018please don\u2019t do this,\u2019\u201d he wrote.

The electric carmaker, which will join the S&P 500 on Monday after rallying nearly 700% this year, ranks near the highest in implied volatility - or expectations for stock moves embedded in options prices - on the index.  Still, analysts say Tesla\u2019s shares will have a miniscule effect on broader market gyrations, based on past activity. If Tesla had been added to the S&P 500 on Thursday, it would have increased one-month implied volatility on the benchmark index by just 0.15 points, to 17.08 from 16.93, according to Susquehanna.  \u201cWe do not think it is going to have a huge impact,\u201d said Christopher Murphy, Susquehanna\u2019s co-head of derivatives strategy.

(Reporting by Philip George in Bengaluru; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)","696":"(Reuters) - Chief Executive Elon Musk has never sought pre-approval for a single tweet about Tesla Inc since striking a court-approved deal about how to communicate important information about the electric vehicle maker, the top U.S. securities regulator told a judge on Monday.  The Securities and Exchange Commission is doubling down on the government\u2019s demand to find the Tesla CEO in contempt of a previous fraud settlement that required him to have the company pre-approve any tweets that could materially impact the automaker.  The ongoing public battle between Tesla\u2019s chief executive and the SEC piles pressure on Musk, the public face of Tesla, who is struggling to make the company profitable after cutting the price of its Model 3 sedan to $35,000.  The SEC said a Feb. 19 tweet that Musk sent to his more than 24 million Twitter followers claiming the electric vehicle-maker would build around 500,000 cars in 2019 was \u201ca blatant violation\u201d of the agreement.  The SEC asked Tesla in late February whether any of Musk's tweets had been pre-approved since that policy was adopted, according to the filing bit.ly\/2HsMiUr in federal court in Manhattan.  Tesla responded, after more than two weeks, to say simply: \u201cNo.\u201d  \u201cIt is therefore stunning to learn that, at the time of filing of the instant motion, Musk had not sought pre-approval for a single one of the numerous tweets about Tesla he published in the months since the court-ordered pre-approval policy went into effect,\u201d the SEC said in the filing.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The regulator last month alleged that Musk had violated a September settlement of fraud charges by tweeting material information about Tesla without pre-approval from the company.  In response, Musk had argued that his \u201csingle, immaterial\u201d tweet was in compliance with the settlement, and that the SEC\u2019s push to find him in contempt infringed on his free speech.  Lawyers for Musk said the tweet complied with the company\u2019s communication policy for senior executives and was a \u201cproud and optimistic restatement of publicly disclosed information.\u201d  The SEC said in Monday\u2019s filing that the pre-approval policy agreed in the settlement was designed to include a wide variety of his comments, not just those that were deemed material by the regulator\u2019s standards.  The fraud settlement between Musk, Tesla and the SEC resolved a lawsuit brought by the regulator over claims Musk made on Twitter in August that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The SEC called those tweets \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d and a go-private deal never materialized.  As part of that settlement, Musk stepped down as the company\u2019s chairman and he and Tesla agreed to pay $20 million each in fines.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Tesla has backed off a plan to close all its U.S. stores and said it will instead raise prices of its higher-end vehicles by about 3 percent on average. Last week, Tesla unveiled its Model Y crossover SUV, targeted to begin production in 2020.  Musk called the regulator the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission\u201d on Twitter after the settlement, and tweeted that \u201csomething is broken with SEC oversight\u201d just one day after the agency started pursuing the contempt order.  Legal experts have said the SEC could pursue multiple avenues, including a higher fine, imposing further restrictions on Musk\u2019s activities or removing him from Tesla\u2019s board or helm.  Tesla published a new communications policy in December for senior executives as part of the settlement. It called for Tesla\u2019s general counsel and a newly designated in-house securities law attorney to pre-approve any written statements about Tesla that could be material.  A disclosure controls committee, made up of board members Brad Buss, Antonio Gracias and James Murdoch, was tasked with overseeing compliance with the new policy.

Explaining his reversal in a late-night blog post on Friday, the billionaire CEO said that taking the company private \u201cwould be even more time-consuming and distracting than initially anticipated,\u201d and that \u201cmost of Tesla\u2019s existing shareholders believe we are better off as a public company.\u201d  It was on Aug. 7 that Musk first surprised investors with his plan by tweeting that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d for a go-private deal, which would have had a value of $72 billion. In a separate tweet, he wrote: \u201cInvestor support is confirmed.\u201d  Musk and Tesla are facing investor lawsuits and a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the truthfulness of the CEO\u2019S Aug. 7 tweets, according to an Aug. 8 report by the Wall Street Journal.  The SEC declined to confirm that report to Reuters. A Tesla spokesman declined to comment.  \u201cThe SEC will continue its investigation until it\u2019s satisfied that it is on top of the facts,\u201d said Stephen Crimmins, an attorney with Murphy & McGonigle who spent 14 years at the SEC, where he prosecuted hundreds of securities cases.  \u201cWhat happened on Friday will be of interest to the SEC because it will allow them to probe whether Musk\u2019s pulling back from the go-private somehow indicates that he did not have a reasonable basis for his statement. They will be asking questions of him and others involved in the decision as to why he reversed course.\u201d  Musk has stuck to his original statement that he believed a deal was possible, and one person familiar with the discussions told Reuters that Musk was serious about taking the carmaker private.  But acting in good faith may not be enough to help Musk escape the regulator\u2019s gaze.  U.S. securities law requires public company executives to have a \u201creasonable basis\u201d on which to make representations to the investing public, and that would likely be the focus of an SEC probe, said three securities lawyers.  It remains unclear what Musk meant by \u201cfunding secured.\u201d In an Aug. 13 statement, Musk said that he left a July 31 meeting with the managing director of Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund \u201cwith no question that a deal ... could be closed.\u201d  The Saudi fund had earlier acquired a just-below 5 percent stake in Tesla on the open market. But the fund has made no comment on whether it had promised to back a much larger Tesla go-private deal.  \u2018FUNDING SECURED\u2019  Musk said on Friday he believed there was plenty of potential funding to take the company private, but he did not provide any further details to bolster his \u201cfunding secured\u201d assertion.  Teresa Goody, CEO of law firm Goody Counsel and a former SEC attorney, said Musk\u2019s statement on Friday appeared to undermine his Aug. 7 tweet that investor support was confirmed.  She also raised concerns about a second comment Musk made on Friday, where he said it had become apparent that compliance restrictions would prevent many of Tesla\u2019s institutional shareholders from holding private Tesla equity.  Both statements are likely to raise further questions among SEC officials as to whether Musk had performed sufficient due diligence to have had a reasonable basis for his Aug. 7 tweets, she said.  Another statement in the blog that could catch the eye of SEC officials is Musk\u2019s reference to his discussion with Tesla\u2019s board on Thursday, during which both parties decided not to pursue the deal, said M. Ridgway Barker, a partner and chair of the corporate finance practice at law firm Withersworldwide.  Such discussions are unlikely to be subject to legal privilege and the SEC could subpoena minutes of the meeting, he said.  \u201cIf the board discussion included that the deal is not financeable, or prohibitively expensive, that is going to cast further doubt over Musk\u2019s claims,\u201d he said.

The Tesla logo is seen on a car in Los Angeles, California, U.S., July 9, 2020. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/Files  Glass Lewis said its recommendation changed due to the satisfactory action taken by Tesla regarding liability insurance for its directors.  Tesla will hold its annual shareholder meeting on Sept. 22.  Glass Lewis said it changed its recommendation due to the move by Tesla\u2019s board to replace its earlier liability insurance policy with a 90-day interim arrangement to resume evaluating more traditional options for liability insurance.  In June, Glass Lewis had joined Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) in opposing the chairwoman\u2019s re-election to the board.  The recommendation was based on corporate governance concerns due to an insurance arrangement with Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, after Tesla\u2019s decision to not renew its liability policy for directors and officers over high premiums quoted by insurers.  \u201cWe are concerned that this D&O arrangement gives the company\u2019s independent directors a direct, personal financial dependency upon the CEO they are tasked with overseeing,\u201d Glass Lewis had said in its earlier recommendation.  On Tuesday, the proxy adviser said that while Glass Lewis still regarded the revised policy as \u201cunorthodox and potentially conflicting\u201d, it at least showed that Tesla responded to concerns from shareholders and related parties regarding the earlier policy.  \u201cWhile we do not believe that recommending shareholder opposition to any director is warranted based solely on this issue at this time, we may recommend holding certain directors accountable should the company ultimately fail to commit to a less problematic D&O arrangement,\u201d Glass Lewis said.  Denholm, a company director for nearly six years, was named Tesla chairwoman in November 2018 at a time when investors were demanding more robust oversight of Musk\u2019s activities and public outbursts.","709":"BEIJING, April 9 (Reuters) - China\u2019s quality watchdog said on Monday that Tesla Inc will recall a total of 8,898 Model S vehicles in the country from June 28.

KTVU FOX 2\/via REUTERS  The NTSB\u2019s action means Tesla may not gain access to some information obtained by the agency\u2019s investigators before it is made public, but frees the company to vigorously defend the Autopilot technology.  The war of words on Thursday between the Silicon Valley automaker run by billionaire Elon Musk and the NTSB stood in stark contrast to efforts this week by Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi and Facebook Inc chief Mark Zuckerberg to defuse conflicts with regulators.  Tesla \u201cviolated the party agreement by releasing investigative information before it was vetted and confirmed by the NTSB,\u201d the safety board said in a statement. Releasing incomplete information often leads \u201cto speculation and incorrect assumptions about the probable cause of a crash, which does a disservice to the investigative process and the traveling public,\u201d the agency said.  Tesla in return blasted the NTSB, saying the company chose on Tuesday to withdraw from the agreement as a formal party before the agency revoked its status.  Tesla said it had \u201cbeen clear in our conversations with the NTSB that they\u2019re more concerned with press headlines than actually promoting safety\u201d and accused the agency of violating its own rules while trying to prevent Tesla from disclosing all the facts.  \u201cWe don\u2019t believe this is right and we will be making an official complaint to Congress,\u201d Tesla added, saying it would make an open records request to \u201cunderstand the reasoning behind their focus on the safest cars in America while they ignore the cars that are the least safe.\u201d  NTSB spokesman Christopher O\u2019Neil said the agency declined to comment on Tesla\u2019s allegations.  The NTSB has three pending probes into Tesla crashes.  Tesla\u2019s initial statement announcing its withdrawal did not disclose that the NTSB was revoking its status.  Driver Walter Huang died after a March 23 crash and vehicle fire in a Tesla Model X near Mountain View, California, prompting investigations by the NTSB and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  Tesla\u2019s announcement late on Wednesday in California came after the company publicly blamed the driver for the crash and made statements about the incident that drew criticism from the NTSB.  Autopilot is a semi-autonomous system that handles some driving tasks. Tesla has said it warns drivers that they are always responsible for the safe operation of the vehicle.  U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said in a statement he was \u201ctroubled by Tesla\u2019s reckless disregard of its legal obligations to NTSB - potentially compromising NTSB\u2019s ability to conduct a thorough and robust investigation into the company\u2019s flawed Autopilot system.\u201d  AUTOPILOT  NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt told Reuters on Tuesday the agency had a good working relationship with Tesla but that companies must follow the rules. He and Musk spoke on Friday and again on Wednesday when he told the company it was revoking its status.  \u201cIt is unfortunate that Tesla, by its actions, did not abide by the party agreement,\u201d Sumwalt said in the NTSB statement on Thursday. Tesla said that \u201ceven though we won\u2019t be a formal party, we will continue to provide technical assistance to the NTSB.\u201d  Huang\u2019s family said on Wednesday it had hired law firm Minami Tamaki LLP to explore legal options, adding the firm believed the Autopilot feature probably caused his death. The firm said its preliminary review of the crash suggested Autopilot was defective.  The NTSB has not disclosed any findings.  Tesla has said Huang had activated Autopilot and it was in operation at the time of the crash. Vehicle logs from the accident showed no action was taken by Huang before the crash and that he had received warnings from the system to put his hands on the wheel, the company said.  Tesla said the Autopilot system always reminded drivers to be alert and keep their hands on the wheel.  The NTSB confirmed earlier this week it had two other pending investigations of Tesla crashes, including an August 2017 Tesla battery fire in Lake Forest, California, after an owner lost control and ran the vehicle into his garage. The investigation into that fire was first reported by Reuters on Wednesday.  The agency previously faulted Tesla in a 2016 fatal crash in Florida in which Autopilot was engaged. Sumwalt said in 2017 that \u201csystem safeguards were lacking\u201d and \u201cTesla allowed the driver to use the system outside of the environment for which it was designed and the system gave far too much leeway to the driver to divert his attention.\u201d Tesla said it had made improvements in the system since the crash.","712":"(Reuters) - Electric carmaker Tesla Inc said on Tuesday it had hired Snapchat maker Snap Inc\u2019s vice president of monetization engineering, Stuart Bowers, as VP of engineering, to work on its Autopilot software and other projects.

The California-based firm said in a statement that Chinese customers will be allowed to place orders for a long range, rear-wheel-drive Model 3 variant whose price will start at 433,000 yuan ($64,300.56).  Previously, the starting price for a Model 3 in China was 499,000 yuan, for an all-wheel-drive long range version. Tesla said earlier this year that it plans to start delivering Model 3 cars to customers in China in March.  Tesla currently imports all the cars it sells in China but is in the process of building a factory in Shanghai that will manufacture Model 3 cars in the initial phase.  Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said on a post earnings call on Wednesday that Tesla\u2019s Fremont factory is focused almost entirely on building Model 3s for China and Europe.  \u201cIt\u2019s very important to get those cars, especially to China, as soon as possible. We hope the trade negotiations go well , but it\u2019s not clear. But we need to get them there while there\u2019s sort of a de facto - sort of a truce on the tariff war,\u201d Musk said.  Tesla has sent two ships and at least one cargo plane with Model 3 vehicles to China, a logistics source familiar with the matter said.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The company said in October that its China sales have been hammered after Beijing raised tariffs on imports of U.S. autos to 40 percent in July. China has since temporarily suspended the additional 25 percent tariff, reducing it to the 15 percent level.  Tesla has adjusted prices of its U.S.-made cars in China to keep its cars affordable in the country, a move also aimed at helping it fend off competition from a swathe of domestic electric vehicle startups such as Nio Inc, Byton and XPeng Motors.  Tesla has said that it wants to start production at its Shanghai plant in the second half this year and is aiming to build 3,000 Model 3 vehicles per week.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in a lawsuit that Musk had made a series of false and misleading statements and caused volatility in the company\u2019s shares with tweets last month which raised the potential of taking Tesla private before swiftly withdrawing the idea.  Musk, 47, is the public face of Tesla and J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman questioned how easy it would be for the $50-billion manufacturer, which is still losing money, to raise funds at affordable rates without him.  \u201cWe are concerned that decreased confidence in Tesla on the part of investors may impact the company\u2019s ability to raise capital on amenable terms,\u201d Brinkman said.  Four early research notes from Wall Street analysts and brokerages all said that Musk might have to resign.  The Silicon Valley billionaire said overnight he had done nothing wrong and Tesla\u2019s board reiterated its support for him.  \u201cThe SEC civil action may lead to Musk\u2019s exit from Tesla (either permanently or temporarily) and the Musk premium in the shares dissipating,\u201d Barclays analyst Brian Johnson said.  Shares were last down 10.8 pct at $274.17 in trading before the bell in New York, which would wipe about $6 billion off Tesla\u2019s market value.  Gene Munster, managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, said the lawsuit adds further distraction at a critical 6-month juncture in the company\u2019s viability.  \u201cDespite this, we think the company will survive,\u201d he said.  The SEC\u2019s lawsuit, filed in Manhattan federal court, caps a tumultuous two months set in motion on Aug. 7 when Musk told his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take Tesla private at $420 per share, with \u201cfunding secured\u201d.  The regulator charged that Musk \u201cknew or was reckless in not knowing\u201d that his tweets were false and misleading.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Musk\u2019s email, widely posted on social media and authenticated for Reuters by a source familiar with the matter, also said the company had on average produced 900 Model 3 cars per day this week, bringing it closer to a target of 7,000 per week.  Tesla shares were up about 1% after a volatile opening. They rose on the Reuters confirmation of the email, which appeared to counter concerns that demand was dropping after a first-quarter drop in sales.  Shares this week have traded at their lowest since late 2016 and were down for six consecutive sessions.  The communication is one of the first about sales by Musk following an agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that requires a securities lawyer to review his tweets and other communications that have material information.  Demand for Tesla\u2019s Model 3 sedan and other cars has moved to the top of investors\u2019 list of worries after the company reported slack first-quarter demand against a backdrop of U.S.-China trade tensions.  Musk\u2019s focus on cost-cutting has underscored broader concerns about whether Tesla has enough cash to fund its operations while it tries to turn a profit.  In the email sent late on Wednesday, Musk said the company had racked up over 50,000 net new orders this quarter as of Tuesday.  \u201cIt\u2019s the usual Elon Musk scheme: spread positive mood with good news. Elon is a marketing man, but the Tesla reality is sobering,\u201d Nord LB analyst Frank Schwope said.  Tesla declined to comment on whether the email to staff required review under the agreement or if it had been reviewed. The SEC had sued Musk for fraud over his use of Twitter.  The April settlement called for \u201cthe pre-approval of an experienced securities lawyer employed by the company of any written communication\u201d for topics including \u201cproduction numbers or sales or delivery numbers (whether actual, forecasted or projected) that have not been previously published via pre-approved written communications issued by the company.\u201d  Jay Dubow, former branch chief in the SEC\u2019s enforcement division and a partner with Pepper Hamilton LLP, said, \u201cIf Musk made the communication publicly, then I believe it needs to be approved in advance by the company consistent with the settlement agreement. If the email was internal only, and was leaked, that is likely outside of the SEC\u2019s settlement.\u201d  Tesla had reported a 31% fall in first-quarter deliveries and had warned that profit would be delayed until the latter half of the year as it struggled with shipments of Model 3 to China and Europe due to longer transit time.  The carmaker is building a factory in China to produce Model 3 in the world\u2019s largest auto market and to escape a rise in tariffs on cars imported from the United States.  \u201cWhile we are critical of Tesla\u2019s execution, we think people have been way too eager to assume the worst case scenario,\u201d said Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin, who has a \u201cneutral\u201d rating on the stock.  \u201cTesla is the EV industry leader for a reason, and we expect the company to remain successful.\u201d","717":"A Tesla sign is seen during the China International Import Expo (CIIE), at the National Exhibition and Convention Center in Shanghai, China November 6, 2018. REUTERS\/Aly Song - RC191FE8E020  HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk is finally getting his adult supervision. Robyn Denholm, finance chief at Australian telecom operator Telstra, will move from her boardroom seat at Tesla to the head of the table \u2013 and oversee the $60 billion electric-car maker\u2019s erratic chief executive full-time. She will have to get tougher, though.  Having an independent chair is a plus, even if it was forced on Musk by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A regulatory settlement followed his excessively confident public statements about a potential deal to take Tesla private. The company has plenty on its plate, from the hands-on task of ramping up vehicle production to keeping investors sweet and dealing with the continuing fallout from Musk\u2019s overcooked remarks.  Denholm has the kind of record that ought to help, at least once she has fully extracted herself from Telstra in six months. Her professional background includes roles involving autos at Toyota and technology at Juniper Networks. Her experience also encompasses operational matters and finance, both important at Tesla.  That said, Denholm doesn\u2019t step into the job with a clean sheet. Since 2014, she has been among the directors who allowed Musk far too much leeway. She chaired the company\u2019s audit committee and was involved in Tesla\u2019s bizarre $2.6 billion acquisition of SolarCity, another pet Musk project, whose activities have since dwindled. She even has the dubious honour of being named in at least one investor lawsuit.  Chairing the Tesla board full-time solves Denholm\u2019s globe-trotting commute. Moreover, last year she collected eyebrow-raising remuneration of nearly $5 million from the automaker, more than three times the roughly $1.5 million she was paid in the year to June for her full-time job Down Under. That may help explain why she is going all-in on Musk just a month after taking the CFO job at Telstra.  Musk says he is looking forward to working with his new boss. A chair and a CEO should ideally be in sync. But to provide the checks and balances the SEC and investors clearly want, Denholm is also going to have stand up to Musk more often than the board on which she sat has done thus far.","718":"April 24 (Reuters) - U.S. electric pickup truck startup Rivian Automotive LLC said on Wednesday that Ford Motor Co invested $500 million in the company, which is seen as one of the major rivals to Tesla Inc.

FILE PHOTO: SpaceX founder Elon Musk speaks at a press conference following the first launch of a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S., February 6, 2018. REUTERS\/Joe Skipper\/File Photo  Below are several questions and answers on SpaceX, its shareholders, valuation and customers.  WHAT DID MUSK SAY WHEN HE COMPARED SPACEX AND TESLA?  In a letter here on Tesla's website, Musk said that taking the company private would shield Tesla from the scrutiny of Wall Street and its demand for positive quarterly results. Musk pointed to SpaceX to explain the benefits of private ownership.  \u201cSpaceX is a perfect example: it is far more operationally efficient, and that is largely due to the fact that it is privately held. This is not to say that it will make sense for Tesla to be private over the long term. In the future, once Tesla enters a phase of slower, more predictable growth, it will likely make sense to return to the public markets.\u201d  Musk said in a tweet that he hoped all current investors would stay with Tesla when it went private and had a \u201cspecial purpose\u201d fund structure in mind to accomplish that. A special purpose vehicle is a structure that pools investors into a single entity. Private market experts say they are unclear how that would work.  WHAT IS SPACEX?  Founded in 2003, Hawthorne, California-based SpaceX has upended the space industry with its relatively low-cost reusable Falcon 9 rockets. The company has completed more than 50 successful Falcon launches and snagged billions of dollars in contracts, including from NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense. In February it test-launched the Falcon Heavy, the most powerful operational rocket in the world.  WHO OWNS SPACEX?  A Musk trust owns 54 percent of the outstanding stock of SpaceX, and has voting control of 78 percent of the outstanding shares, according to a 2016 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, SpaceX\u2019s most recent.  No other shareholder owns 10 percent or more. Alphabet's Google Inc GOOGL.O invested $900 million in January 2015, Google said. Five Fidelity Investments funds had a collective stake worth roughly about $436 million, according to disclosures from March and June, the most recent available.  After raising $450 million last year and another tranche of $214 million this year, the company is valued at about $25 billion.  Other investors include venture capitalists and private investors such as Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Founders Fund, Valor Equity Partners and Capricorn.  A SpaceX spokeswoman declined to comment on its shareholders, future or current investors, or its capital structure. She referred to comments that Musk has made publicly.  CAN EMPLOYEES, SMALL INVESTORS BUY AND SELL SHARES?  Employees get stock units or options to buy shares they can sell after several years, according to people familiar with the matter.  SpaceX is a regular sponsor of stock sales for investors and employees to cash out. Musk said that every six months, employees and external shareholders can buy and sell shares. Two people who have worked at SpaceX and an investor confirmed the process, although they say it is tightly controlled, with SpaceX determining who can sell, who can buy, as well as how often sales are held.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  One former SpaceX employee, who still owns shares, said the last selling period was in March and the previous selling window was in August 2017.  The former employee added that SpaceX workers are given ample opportunities to sell shares in the secondary market.  \u201cFor most folks who own Tesla and SpaceX, they recognize these are long-term investments,\u201d the ex-employee said. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to completely ignore it when it\u2019s always in the news and there\u2019s so much volatility.\u201d  Musk said he wants all Tesla investors to continue to hold private company stock.  \u201cWould create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelity\u2019s SpaceX investment,\u201d he wrote in a tweet.  The Fidelity funds own shares in SpaceX that were purchased directly, and not through a special purpose fund.  Other SpaceX investors have stakes in the company through the special purpose funds, or special purpose vehicles. In those cases, many investors put money into a single fund, and that fund takes a stake in the company, according to a SpaceX investor.  Generally, companies do not know the identities of investors in the special purpose vehicles, although they are typically professional, and not retail, investors, who for various reasons are unable to directly invest in a highly valued startup.  Regulations cap the number of investors in a private company at 2,000.  DOES NASA CARE IF ITS CONTRACTORS ARE PUBLIC OR PRIVATE COMPANIES?  NASA has selected both private and public companies for space services. For example, it hired Northrop Grumman Corp NOC.N and SpaceX for cargo resupply missions to the International Space Station, and partnered with Boeing Co BA.N and SpaceX as the companies develop rocket-and-capsule vehicles for carrying astronauts to the space station.","721":"(Reuters) - A central Texas county that includes Austin on Tuesday approved a plan to provide millions in tax subsidies to Tesla Inc TSLA.O if it builds a $1.1 billion vehicle factory in the area.

A Tesla spokesman rejected the claims.  \u201cIt\u2019s patently obvious there is no merit to this lawsuit,\u201d a Tesla spokesman told Reuters in an email.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Tesla\u2019s stock has recovered in the runup to the event scheduled and it gained 1.4% in early trading on Monday, helped by a leaked email from Musk that said the company was hopeful of racking up record car deliveries in the third quarter.  Many analysts expect Musk to unveil battery improvements extending the Palo Alto, California automaker\u2019s lead over General Motors, Volkswagen and other rivals.  Tesla options are pricing in a stock move of around 17% - up or down - by Friday, said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group.  Tesla\u2019s stock has more than made up for a historic slump on Sept. 8 after it was unexpectedly left out of a group companies joining the S&P 500, and it has surged over 400% year to date. Still, Tesla remains below its Aug. 31 record high close.  Analysts, including those with neutral ratings on Tesla\u2019s stock, expect major advances from Musk.  \u201cWe (and the market) expect the announcements to be significant, cementing Tesla\u2019s cost and technology lead for several more years,\u201d UBS analyst Patrick Hummel wrote in a client note on Sept. 11, adding he expects a new dry electrode cell technology to help speed manufacturing and lower costs.  Batteries make electric cars cost more than gasoline-powered ones, so the ability to produce low-cost, long-lasting batteries could put Tesla cars on a more equal footing and help usher in mainstream acceptance.  Musk in August suggested on Twitter that Tesla may be able to mass produce batteries with 50% more energy density in three to four years, which could even enable electric airplanes.  A much hyped \u201cAutonomy Investor Day\u201d in April last year failed to stop a five-month decline in the company\u2019s stock. At that 2019 event, Musk said that Tesla robotaxis with no human drivers would be available in some U.S. markets in 2020, continuing a habit of making bold pronouncements and setting deadlines Tesla does not meet.  \u201cEven if Tesla provides overly ambitious aspirations at Battery Day, we nevertheless expect the event to reinforce Tesla\u2019s long-term growth narrative \u2013 central to the stock, while also reinforcing investor perception that Tesla is ahead of other automakers,\u201d Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy wrote in a Sept. 16 research note.  New battery cell designs, chemistries and manufacturing processes are just some developments that would allow Tesla to reduce its reliance on its long-time battery partner, Japan\u2019s Panasonic.  Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne said in a recent client note he expects Tesla to announce it is bringing battery cell production in-house, and for Musk to focus on work done on \u201cmillion mile\u201d batteries.  Eight Wall Street analysts recommend buying Tesla\u2019s stock, while 10 recommend selling and another 15 are neutral. The median average price target is $305, which is 31% below Friday\u2019s close.  Underscoring many investors\u2019 concerns that Tesla\u2019s stock has become overvalued, it is trading at about 150 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, about double its five year average, according to Refinitiv.","724":"Tesla Model 3s are shown charging in an underground parking lot next to a Tesla store in San Diego,California, U.S., May 30, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk has eked out some breathing space for Tesla. The $50 billion electric-car maker burned less cash last quarter. It also started cutting 9 percent of its workforce. Along with producing more Model 3s, the company\u2019s volatile chief executive reckons that should turn the company profitable in the second half of the year.  Tesla incinerated more than $400 million of greenbacks in the quarter to June. That\u2019s fewer than the $700 million it ran through in the first three months of the year and better than expected by Wall Street analysts. Musk even apologized on Wednesday\u2019s earnings call for deriding some of their questions as \u201cboring\u201d and \u201cbonehead\u201d in May.  His outfit now has $2.2 billion in cash. If he manages to tow Tesla out of the red by the end of 2018, there\u2019s a chance the figure won\u2019t dip below the $1.5 billion or so needed to keep the factory gates open, as estimated by Citigroup.  Tesla, though, also ended the second quarter with an extra $400 million of accounts payable \u2013 in other words, bills from suppliers and the like. That\u2019s not necessarily problematic, but it could mean the reduction in the cash burn is not as big or as sustainable as it appears.  What\u2019s more, Tesla has $1.1 billion of bonds coming due by February. Assume another $300 million of cash outflows before the company turns profitable and the carmaker would have under $800 million in readies by the middle of next year\u2019s first quarter.  That means it has to go from constantly burning cash to generating decent amounts before the end of this year if it\u2019s to avoid having to raise more equity.  Many investors are still believers. Tesla\u2019s shares are still worth a whopping 35 times the mean of analysts\u2019 estimates for 2020 earnings, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S. Others, though, are unconvinced. Tesla bonds trade at around 89 cents on the dollar. And the stock has fallen almost a fifth from its peak in June.  Distractions like Musk\u2019s badmouthing last month of a diver involved in rescuing the Thai boys trapped in a cave haven\u2019t helped. If the boss fails to start churning out cash in the next few months, he could be in for more market punishment.","725":"TOKYO, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Shares of Panasonic Corp jumped more than 8% in early Tuesday trade after the Japanese electronics conglomerate the previous day reported its first quarterly profit at its U.S. battery venture with Tesla Inc .

Tesla said Nextmove chose not to take delivery of the cars.  Nextmove said its Model 3 vehicles had paint defects, faulty wiring, scratches on the dashboard, faulty wheels and condensation in the headlights.

Tesla said it was in the process of resolving the issues and had provided replacement vehicles.  \u201cWe believe the customer\u2019s decision not to take delivery of its remaining Model 3 orders wasn\u2019t entirely due to quality issues, but was largely influenced by their frustration with an unrelated dispute from earlier in the year,\u201d Tesla said in a statement, without elaborating further.

And Tesla\u2019s volatile and broadly underperforming stock is one reason why, they said.  Convertible securities feature the income and protections of a low-yielding bond but offer the potential to profit far more from a jump in the stock price that triggers repayment in shares rather than cash.  In the new deal, being sold alongside $650 million in new shares, Tesla is looking to offer an interest rate below the coupon on its previous convertible from two years ago, even though interest rates today are broadly higher. There is also a higher bar for taking advantage of the stock price.  Investors, however, said the new deal in fact looks appealing when compared with Tesla\u2019s existing convertibles, which now feature even leaner yields and, because the stock has been so wobbly, an even lower chance at striking a rich equity conversion before those bonds mature in the next three years.  \u201cWith this new bond, you have five years until the bond is supposed to pay off. They don\u2019t have to be successful, they don\u2019t have to hit a home run. They just have to stay in business to refinance this in five years,\u201d said Geoffrey Dancey, managing partner and portfolio manager at Cutler Capital Management.  The fundraising - which could top $2 billion in total - is easing Wall Street concerns about the carmaker, which has struggled to maintain profitability, and its ability to overcome a drop in sales and build new product lines. Tesla shares, which had fallen by nearly 10% in the two years since its last convertible was sold, ended more than 4% higher on Thursday.  The new convertible bond is seen carrying a coupon of between 1.5% and 2.0% with a conversion premium of between 27.5% and 32.5% over the reference price for Tesla shares at the time of the sale, according to a trader who saw preliminary marketing materials for the deal on Thursday.  While those appear to be poorer terms for investors than the 2.375% coupon on the $977.5 million convertible bond maturing in March 2022, it is superior to the current yield to maturity on that 2022 bond at around 1%, Dancey said.  On its face, the conversion premium being touted, with a midpoint at 30%, also compares unfavorably to the 2022 bond\u2019s lower conversion premium of 25%. But the underperformance of the stock, which closed at $244.10 on Thursday, means holders of the 2022 bond need at least a 34% rise in the stock to a price of$327.50 in order to trigger a conversion.  \u201cThe terms of the convertible look reasonable, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll have any issue selling,\u201d said Dancey, who may buy some of the new bonds. He does not have an existing position.  Another boost to demand could come from the legion of short sellers of Tesla shares who often buy convertibles as a hedge, a common arbitrage used by hedge funds, said Eli Pars, co-chief investment officer at Calamos Investments. More than 25% of Tesla\u2019s public float of stock is sold short.  \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything that would make me think this would have any trouble getting done,\u201d Pars said. Calamos has positions in convertibles from both Tesla and its solar panel-making unit, Solar City, according to its most recent SEC filing.  \u201cWith convertible bonds there are many opportunities for things to turn out OK,\u201d he said.  Ross Gerber, chief executive of investment manager Gerber Kawasaki, known for his bullish positions on Tesla said the \u201cnoise\u201d surrounding Tesla - including Chief Executive Elon Musk\u2019s recent court fight with the SEC over his tweets - had rattled some of his clients.  \u201cWhen we build a portfolio, Tesla will be a part of it. But what we\u2019ll probably be doing is adding more on the convertible side not on the equity side,\u201d he said.","734":"BEIJING (Reuters) - China will exempt Tesla Inc's TSLA.O electric vehicles from its purchase tax, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) said on Friday, a concession made amidst trade tensions with the United States.

Tesla\u2019s Model S residual values are falling, Einhorn wrote, noting he has been frustrated by power windows and touch screen problems in his own Model S sedan and got rid of the vehicle as his lease ended.  The company\u2019s more affordable Model 3 got modest reviews and bad publicity, which Einhorn said was \u201cprobably having a negative impact on the brand.\u201d He said he doubted the car could be \u201cproduced profitably anytime soon, if ever\u201d and criticized the company\u2019s plan to rush cars to customers.

Earlier this month, he apologized to British caver Vern Unsworth after making insulting comments that pushed Tesla shares down.  Einhorn, along with fellow hedge fund manager Jim Chanos, is one of the electric carmaker\u2019s fiercest critics, accusing it of putting \u201cdangerous products\u201d on the road and saying it was burning through cash.  Despite Einhorn\u2019s steady complaints, Tesla\u2019s stock price has raced ahead, turning his own short bet into a wreck that rivals say he should have trimmed.  His own investors have complained about Einhorn\u2019s stubbornness and criticized his unwillingness to say how much he has lost on the bet and come up with specific ideas to improve the portfolio\u2019s long-running underperformance.  Einhorn acknowledged mistakes and said the fund\u2019s returns over the past three years have been \u201cfar worse than we could have imagined.\u201d He also said several investors have run out of patience and asked for their money back. A filing from the end of March showed Greenlight had assets of roughly $4 billion.  \u201cRight now the market is telling us we are wrong, wrong, wrong about nearly everything,\u201d he wrote.

Slideshow ( 6 images )  Sporting signature Polestar gold seat belts, the Polestar 2 will cost about 59,900 euros ($68,100) for its launch edition and can be driven for around 275 miles before it needs recharging - broadly in line with the Model 3\u2019s current price in Europe of 58,800 euros and about 260 miles range.  The Model 3 and Polestar 2 are cheaper than most of the electric models launched by traditional premium carmakers so far, as Tesla and Polestar bet mass market customers are on the verge of adopting battery technology. Both have also promised even lower prices later on.  Polestar\u2019s launch comes as Tesla is trying to ramp up Model 3 sales in Europe and China, where recent government subsidies and programs are boosting the take up of electric vehicles. A cut in subsidies in the United States, in contrast, is dampening demand in the Californian start-up\u2019s home market.  Tesla was dealt a setback this month after influential U.S. magazine Consumer Reports withdrew its endorsement for the Model 3, citing reliability problems. Analysts say Polestar has strong engineering as it is built on the Volvo platform.  Polestar\u2019s chief executive told Reuters he hoped to sell \u201cnorth of\u201d 50,000 Polestar 2s annually within two or three years after deliveries start from the first half of 2020, but said how much production capacity the company sets up would depend on market conditions.  \u201cIf the market develops fine, I don\u2019t think the production volume will be the limitation. It depends much more on how the car resonates with the market, how the market develops and how the tariffs develop,\u201d Thomas Ingenlath said.  Carmakers including Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW are beginning deliveries of premium electric cars unveiled over the past year as they try to muscle in on a market that Tesla has dominated so far.  Securing the electric market has become increasingly important as demand for traditional combustion engine vehicles slows in China and Europe, partly due to tariffs stemming from Washington\u2019s trade war with Beijing.  Although electric carmakers have also been affected, with Tesla having adjusted Model 3 prices in China after tariffs, Ingenlath said he expected electric sales to be supported by government subsidies and as the market grows from a low base.  Electric vehicle sales forecasts support this view.  Made at Polestar\u2019s facility in China, the Polestar 2 is the first of five fully electric vehicles that Volvo has promised.  The car, which Polestar hopes to largely offer via a Netflix-style monthly subscription model that covers insurance and maintenance costs, will be initially sold in China, United States, Canada and six European markets.  Ingenlath said he expected Asia, North America and Europe to each account for roughly a third of sales, though China would be slightly larger.  Volvo, which owns half of Polestar with the rest held by its Chinese parent Geely, said earlier this year it was talking to investors about raising funds to support Polestar\u2019s electrification costs. Ingenlath said it was too early to give an update on how that was progressing.","743":"BEIJING (Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Thursday it planned to start making electric vehicle (EV) chargers in China in 2021, part of the U.S. carmaker\u2019s push to boost sales in the world\u2019s biggest car market.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Tesla on Tuesday night released a beta, or test version, of what it calls a \u201cFull Self Driving\u201d software upgrade to an undisclosed number of \u201cexpert, careful\u201d drivers. The release prompted online posts by excited recipients who shared video snippets of their car driving apparently autonomously on city streets at night.  During a Tesla earnings call on Wednesday, Chief Executive Elon Musk said the latest upgrade was planned to be widely released by the end of this year, with the system becoming more robust as it collected more data.  \u201cNHTSA has been briefed on Tesla\u2019s new feature, which represents an expansion of its existing driver assistance system. The agency will monitor the new technology closely and will not hesitate to take action to protect (the) public against unreasonable risks to safety,\u201d the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement.  NHTSA in July said its special crash investigation team had \u201clooked into 19 crashes involving Tesla vehicles where it was believed some form of advanced driver assistance system was engaged at the time of the incident.\u201d  Musk for years has promised self-driving for the company\u2019s vehicles but missed several self-imposed deadlines.  Researchers, regulators and insurance groups say true self-driving is still years away and more complex than companies anticipated several years ago. They have criticized Tesla\u2019s promotion of its existing semi-automated Autopilot system as dangerously misleading.  A consortium of self-driving technology companies, Partners for Automated Vehicle Education (PAVE), which includes Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co and Google\u2019s self-driving unit Waymo, criticized Tesla\u2019s approach.  \u201cPublic road testing is a serious responsibility and using untrained consumers to validate beta-level software on public roads is dangerous and inconsistent with existing guidance and industry norms,\u201d PAVE said in a Thursday statement.  Autopilot and similar advanced driver assistance systems can provide steering, braking and acceleration support under limited circumstances, generally on highways.  Tesla's website describes the new software release as \"Autosteer on City Streets,\" saying the system requires active driver supervision and does not make the car autonomous. here  Tesla owners can purchase \u201cFull Self Driving\u201d for $8,000 in hopes of eventually receiving the upgrade. Musk said early Thursday the price would rise by $2,000 on Monday, but later in the day tweeted U.S. price hikes would be pushed to Thursday next week. Similar price increases will apply in other countries as the test version was released there, he added.  On Twitter, Tesla owners receiving the test version posted videos of their experience, claiming the car \"literally sees everything,\" setting indicators on its own and navigating turns even without clear lane markings. bit.ly\/3kpgvUu  They also posted a picture of the software update release notes, which said the system \u201cmay do the wrong thing at the worst time,\u201d urging drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay extra attention.

The filing was part of a lawsuit by Tesla shareholders alleging the company\u2019s board breached its duties to investors by approving the $2.6 billion acquisition of the struggling company, which was run by Musk\u2019s first cousins and of which he was a chairman and the largest stakeholder. The former SolarCity operations have been a drag on Tesla, with panel installations slumping since they were acquired.  Defendants asked the Delaware Court of Chancery judge to dismiss the case before it heads to a trial in March. Shareholder lawsuits that survive a motion to dismiss often settle before trial, which in this case might involve a payment to shareholders by Musk as well as money from directors\u2019 insurance.  Tesla did not immediate respond to a request for comment on the allegations revealed in the documents.  The suit represents another legal headache for Musk, the high-profile entrepreneur who settled a lawsuit by U.S. securities regulators last year over his use of Twitter and is being sued by for defamation by a British diver who said Musk falsely branded him a pedophile. Just last week, a Delaware judge ruled that Tesla must defend at trial Musk\u2019s multibillion-dollar pay package.  According to the filing, Musk was informed at a SolarCity board meeting in October 2015 that SolarCity needed to raise up to $300 million and was slashing its solar installation forecast for the year. The company issued $113 million in convertible notes a month later, of which Musk bought $10 million.  By February 2016, SolarCity management told the board its cash balances were forecast to drop below amounts required for a key line of credit for several months of the year. A default on that line of credit would trigger defaults on other debt instruments, the filing said.  Despite the bad news, Musk proposed the acquisition of SolarCity to the Tesla board later that month after a Lake Tahoe family vacation with his cousin, SolarCity Chief Executive and founder Lyndon Rive.  SolarCity did not disclose the details of its liquidity concerns to investors.  At a meeting of Tesla\u2019s board on June 20, 2016, Musk advocated to fellow board members an initial acquisition price of $28.50 per share for SolarCity - a 30% premium to its market price - even though Tesla\u2019s financial adviser, Evercore, had recommended $25 to $27 a share.  The board ultimately approved an exchange ratio that represented a share price of $26.50 to $28.50 a share, though the offer was lowered later prior to the deal closing.  Once Tesla made the offer for SolarCity on June 21, Musk publicly recused himself from the deal. But according to the filings he held frequent meetings with Evercore and pushed investors in a series of phone calls to support the purchase.  \u201cI could not be recused from all discussions ... I needed to voice my opinion, obviously,\u201d Musk said during questioning under oath by lawyers for the suing shareholders.  In the meantime, Musk assured Rive that he would \u201chave covered\u201d with respect to cash needs until the acquisition closed as SolarCity \u201cwas running crazy close\u201d to its liquidity covenants, the documents said.  The companies said SolarCity accepted the offer on Aug. 1, 2016. The stock swap offer valued SolarCity at $25.37 a share, less than the initial proposal, and in line with the Evercore proposal. Shareholders approved the deal on Nov. 17.  At the time, Musk called the merger a \u201cno brainer\u201d that would create a renewable energy powerhouse, but many on Wall Street have billed it as a bailout of an affiliated firm. Tesla has since gutted its solar sales force and faced an 85% drop in installations.

NHTSA is also probing the January 2018 crash of a Tesla vehicle apparently traveling in Autopilot that struck a fire truck in Culver City, California, a May 2018 crash in Utah of a Tesla in Autopilot mode and a May 2018 Tesla accident in Florida that killed two teenagers and injured another but was not in Autopilot.  The NTSB is investigating three earlier Tesla incidents being reviewed by NHTSA, as well as an August 2017 Tesla battery fire in California, in which an owner ran into his garage.  Friday\u2019s crash is similar to the first fatal Tesla crash linked to Autopilot.  In May 2016, a Tesla Model S driver was killed near Williston, Florida, using Autopilot when he slammed into a tractor trailer that also sheared off the vehicle roof.  The NTSB said in 2017 Tesla lacked proper safeguards allowing the driver \u201cto use the system outside of the environment for which it was designed and the system gave far too much leeway to the driver to divert his attention.\u201d  In January 2017, NHTSA said its review found no evidence of defects in the 2016 fatal Autopilot crash that would require a recall.  Tesla says its Autopilot software reduces a driver\u2019s \u201coverall workload\u201d and will \u201csteer, accelerate and brake for you within almost any lane. It will also automatically change lanes on most highways to overtake other cars or navigate to interchanges and exits.\u201d  Tesla says the feature \u201cshould not be used on highways that have very sharp turns or lane markings that are absent, faded, or ambiguous.\u201d","756":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc shares were down 2% on Wednesday, as analysts remained divided on the electric-carmaker\u2019s chances of meeting delivery and production targets in the months ahead, despite Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk\u2019s reassurances at an annual shareholder meeting.

And this year, it\u2019s going to be pretty similar at least sort of 60% to 80% growth of the total vehicle fleet, maybe more than that, \u201d Musk said.  Analysts at Cowen & Co, however, questioned the 47-year old billionaire\u2019s comment, saying \u201cMusk claims that sales have far exceeded production, but the data doesn\u2019t suggest\u201d.  \u201cBasic microeconomic theory would suggest that goods or services that don\u2019t have a demand problem, don\u2019t see their prices lowered by half a dozen times in 4-5 months.\u201d  The company has lowered prices for its vehicles multiple times in the past few months to boost sales of its models.  In the first quarter ended March, Tesla reported a 31% fall in deliveries, sparking concerns about the company\u2019s ability to make profits and meet its delivery targets while it grapples with issues related to cash flow and manufacturing.  However, Baird analyst Ben Kallo, rated four out of five stars for his accuracy on estimates for Tesla, believes \u201cbear arguments will be disproven in the coming weeks and months\u201d.  He also expects the carmaker, which witnessed steady demand over the past few weeks, to be cash flow positive in the second quarter.  At least eight Wall Street brokerages cut their price target for Tesla in May to an average of $280.31 a share, according to Refinitiv data. Shares of the company have fallen by around $120 in 2019 and were trading at around $222 before the bell on Wednesday.  Of the 31 analysts who cover the stock, only 12 now recommend buying Tesla shares, while another 12 have a \u201csell\u201d rating and the rest have \u201chold\u201d.  \u201cThere is clearly a somewhat healthy level of demand, but maybe not as aggressive as what Tesla management would like.

A review by the influential magazine on Monday said the car, despite many positives, had \u201cbig flaws,\u201d including braking slower than a full-sized pickup truck. That criticism adds to headaches for Musk, already facing pressure over a series of crashes, production issues, and the company\u2019s finances.  \u201cIf Tesla can update the brakes over the air - an industry first - we\u2019d be happy to retest our Model 3,\u201d said Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports\u2019 director of automotive testing.  In mass-market, mid-sized cars, vehicles recommended by Consumer Reports account for over 80 percent of the category\u2019s sales volume, Barclays analyst Brian Johnson wrote in a client note.  Musk in a tweet late on Monday acknowledged the brake issue and said that the magazine\u2019s tests had used two early versions of the car before improvements had been made.  \u201cLooks like this can be fixed with a firmware update,\u201d Musk tweeted, saying Tesla aimed to roll out a solution a few days. \u201cWith further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs.\u201d  Musk said he would ask Consumer Reports to retest using a more recently built car.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  The Silicon Valley company uses so-called \u201cover-the-air updates\u201d (OTAs) to send software fixes and improvements to its cars.  Tesla stock, down more than $100 a share since September, fell 3.3 percent to $275.01 on Tuesday. The shares had finished almost 3 percent higher on Monday, helped by news of plans to deliver higher-priced, more profitable versions of the Model 3.  The Model 3 began production in July, but the rollout has been hampered by production bottlenecks. The company now plans to build 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of June.  Musk said the variability in stopping distance was due to a braking system calibration algorithm and could indicate some Model 3s took longer to stop than others.  \u201cIf so, we will address this at our expense. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update.\u201d  Tesla has had a fraught relationship with Consumer Reports in the past. A year ago, the magazine pulled its top ranking for Tesla\u2019s flagship Model S sedan due to the automaker\u2019s failure to install an emergency braking feature, but later reinstated it after Tesla performed an OTA to add that feature.  The magazine also did not recommend Tesla\u2019s Model X SUV, calling it \u201cmore showy than practical.\u201d  Neil Saunders, managing director of consumer research house GlobalData Retail, said the braking reports would not deter Tesla fans, \u201cit might raise doubts among the more casual buyer.\u201d","758":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Tuesday that a Tesla Model S was in Autopilot mode and the driver\u2019s hands were off the wheel when it struck a fire truck in Culver City, California, one of a series of crashes the board is investigating involving Tesla\u2019s driver assistance system.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The 2014 Model S Autopilot system was engaged continuously for the final 13 minutes 48 seconds of the trip before the vehicle struck a fire truck parked on Interstate-405 in January 2018, the NTSB safety board said in documents posted on Tuesday.  The board plans to issue a report detailing the crash\u2019s probable cause on Wednesday.  The driver kept his hands off the wheel for all but 51 seconds of the final drive segment and received numerous alerts to place his hands back on the wheel, the documents showed. Tesla Inc did not immediately comment.  The fire truck was unoccupied and the driver was not injured in the incident.  \u201cI was having a coffee and a bagel. And all I remember, that truck, and then I just saw the boom in my face and that was it,\u201d the man behind the wheel told the NTSB.  The report says the Tesla was following a vehicle for an extended period at a speed of around 21 miles per hour (33.8 kph) when the vehicle ahead changed lanes seconds before the crash  After the vehicle in front shifted, the Tesla began accelerating toward the driver-set cruise control speed of 80 mph (129 kph) and hit the parked fire truck while going 30.9 mph. The system did not detect the driver\u2019s hands on the wheel for the final 3 minutes and 41 seconds of the crash.  He did not remember precisely what he was doing at the time of the crash but could have been changing the radio or drinking coffee. Records show the driver was not using his cellphone to text or talk at the time of the crash, the NTSB said.  Tesla\u2019s Autopilot was engaged during at least three fatal U.S. crashes, including fatal March 2018 crashes of a 2018 Model 3 in Delray Beach, Florida and in Mountain View, California of a Model X. Both of those crashes remain under investigation by the NTSB and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The agencies are also investigating other crashes and battery fires involving Tesla vehicles.  The crashes raised questions about the driver-assistance system\u2019s ability to detect hazards and has sparked concern about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.  While Tesla drivers say they are able to avoid holding the steering wheel for extended periods while using Autopilot, Tesla advises drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention while using the system.  In May 2016, a Tesla Model S driver was killed near Williston, Florida, while Autopilot was engaged, when he slammed into a tractor trailer.

The two companies were responding to a report by Japan\u2019s Nikkei that said they had frozen previous plans to raise the capacity of the plant, which supplies battery packs for Tesla cars.  \u201cBoth Tesla and Panasonic continue to invest substantial funds into Gigafactory,\u201d a Tesla spokesperson said.  \u201cThat said, we believe there is far more output to be gained from improving existing production equipment than was previously estimated.\u201d  Giving no details of its sources, the Nikkei reported that financial issues had led the companies to rethink plans to expand the capacity of Gigafactory 1 by another 50 percent next year.  The business daily said the companies had already together invested $4.5 billion in the facility and had been planning to expand the plant\u2019s capacity to the equivalent of 54 gigawatt hours (GWh) a year in 2020 from 35 GWh at present.  The 35 GWh capacity can produce batteries for about 500,000 electric vehicles a year, a source familiar with Tesla\u2019s plans said, meaning that the previously planned expansion would have made the capacity enough for around 770,000 electric vehicles.  \u201cPanasonic established a battery production capacity of 35 GWh in Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory 1 by the end of March 2019 in line with growing demand,\u201d Japan-based Panasonic said in an email.  \u201cWatching the demand situation, Panasonic will study additional investments over 35 GWh in collaboration with Tesla.\u201d  Neither company had made public their detailed future development plans for the site, although Panasonic said in October it was in talks to add to its investment and take capacity over the 35 GWh.  Tesla slid 2.8 percent on the Nasdaq Thursday, while Panasonic shares rose 2.6 percent in midday Tokyo trade Friday.  \u201cPanasonic shares have been dragged down by various Tesla woes,\u201d Masayuki Otani, chief market analyst at Securities Japan. \u201cTurning cautious about further investments is good for Panasonic.

In February, Tesla said it had agreed to buy U.S. energy storage company Maxwell Technologies Inc, sending shares in Panasonic lower.  Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk also said in November the U.S. company would manufacture all its battery modules and packs at its new Shanghai factory and planned to diversify its sources.  The Nikkei report said Panasonic would also suspend its planned investment in Tesla\u2019s new Shanghai plant and would instead provide technical support and a small number of batteries from the Gigafactory.  The Japanese company said in October it would prioritize building additional capacity at the Gigafactory over China.  Lower-than-expected car deliveries by Tesla in the first quarter spooked stock and bond investors earlier this month, adding to Wall Street\u2019s concerns about its future cashflow.

Tesla earlier this month closed a $2.7 billion offering of stock and convertible notes, giving it much needed cash as it ramps up production.  Musk in an email to employees, seen by Reuters, said its net proceeds from the offering gave Tesla only 10 months to achieve breakeven at the rate it was burning cash in the first quarter.  \u201cThat is why, going forward, all expenses of any kind anywhere in the word, including parts, salary, travel expenses, rent, literally every payment that leaves our bank account must (be) reviewed,\u201d Musk said.  Tesla\u2019s attempts to cut costs are not new. In April 2018, in an email sent to employees, Musk said he had instructed his finance team to \u201ccomb through every expense worldwide\u201d to find possible cuts.  More recently, Tesla laid off 9 percent, and 7 percent of its workforce in June 2018, and January, respectively.

Increasing the availability of sustainable energy is a major challenge as cars move from combustion engines to battery-driven electric motors, a shift which will take two decades, Musk said in a talk hosted by Berlin-based publisher Axel Springer.  \u201cIt will take another 20 years for cars to be fully electric. It is like with phones, you cannot replace them all at once,\u201d Musk said in a talk streamed on the Bild.de web site, adding that around 5% of vehicles are replaced every year.  Once electric cars become the norm, electricity from intermittent generating energy sources such as wind and solar will need to be stored, probably through battery technology, he said.  \u201cTogether with large battery packs, both things need to be combined, wind power with battery packs and solar energy,\u201d Musk said.

Reflecting the mixed fourth-quarter report, shares of the Palo Alto, California-based company, which are up 10 percent since the start of the year, were barely changed in extended trading.  Money-losing Tesla\u2019s long-term viability depends on annually selling billions of dollars of Model 3s, the new sedan that starts at $35,000, about half the price of its flagship Model S.. Tesla said that net reservations for the new model were stable during the fourth quarter.  Production delays blamed on battery issues resulted in only 1,550 deliveries in the fourth quarter, far below the 4,100 vehicles expected by analysts - meaning revenue from the highly anticipated vehicle has yet to hit Tesla\u2019s bottom line.  But obstacles to production of 5,000 vehicles by the end of the second quarter \u201cwere getting smaller with every week,\u201d Musk told analysts on a conference call. Once at that production rate, Tesla could begin to generate sustained positive operating income \u201cat some point in 2018,\u201d Musk said.  \u201cI\u2019m cautiously optimistic that we will actually be GAAP profitable with no asterisk,\u201d he added. Using that accounting method, Tesla lost nearly $2 billion last year.  Tesla posted its biggest-ever quarterly loss, but the loss was not as wide as analysts were expecting, and revenue just topped targets.  CASH BURN  Musk reiterated a bold goal to produce 1 million vehicles annually by 2020, with plans to make capital investments related to the upcoming Model Y SUV toward the end of this year. Nearly two years ago, Musk proclaimed that Tesla would produce 500,000 vehicles in 2018, which Model 3 troubles has made near impossible.  A Tesla dealership is seen in West Drayton, just outside London, Britain, February 7, 2018. REUTERS\/Hannah McKay  Analyst Jamie Albertine at Consumer Edge Research said there was a trade-off between accelerating growth and vehicle quality, and it was better not to rush Model 3 production and risk a recall. Tesla\u2019s reiteration of its production target for the quarter was good news, he said.  Tesla Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja said that more than 50 percent of Tesla\u2019s spending was on the Model 3, underscoring that project\u2019s importance and its high cost.  Tesla burned through $3.4 billion last year, and $787 million in the fourth quarter alone, and said capital spending in 2018 would be \u201cslightly more\u201d than in 2017 due to expanded production at its Fremont factory and Nevada Gigafactory.  Other upcoming capital needs include the recently unveiled Tesla Semi, the Model Y and a factory in China.  Tesla ended the fourth quarter with $3.37 billion in cash, just below the $3.5 billion in the previous quarter, which had been boosted by a $1.8 billion debt sale. For the first time, Tesla securitized its leases, raising $546 million earlier this month in securitized notes backed by Model S and X lease payments.  Still, Tesla\u2019s cash burn eased in the quarter, in part thanks to customer deposits for the just unveiled Semi truck and Roadster, inventory reduction of finished vehicles and some Model 3 capital spending deferred to the first quarter.  The niche carmaker has made inroads among luxury car buyers with the advanced technology and innovative design in its Model S sedan and Model X SUV.  Still, it faces a wave of electric vehicles from competitors on the horizon. Global automakers from Ford Motor Co F.N to Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE are cumulatively investing $90 billion in electrification over the next five years, with luxury models from Audi and Tata Motors Ltd's Jaguar TAMO.NS due to hit showrooms this summer.  Amid that sales pressure, Musk announced that Jon McNeill, president of global sales and service, and seen by some as a possible successor to Musk, was leaving the company. He will join U.S. ride hailing company Lyft as its new chief operating officer.  Despite the competitive environment, Tesla's stock has soared 35 percent in the last year, making the company the second-most valuable U.S. automaker, with a market capitalization of $56.1 billion, just behind General Motors Co GM.N, which had net revenue of $145.6 billion in 2017.  Musk scored a clear victory on Tuesday with the successful launch of the world\u2019s most powerful rocket, Falcon Heavy, made by his private company SpaceX. But some analysts have questioned whether his myriad of other interests, from space exploration to tunnel boring technology, are a distraction at a critical time within Tesla.  Net loss widened to $675.4 million, or $4.01 per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 from $121.3 million, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier.  Total revenue rose to $3.29 billion from $2.28 billion.  Excluding items, the company lost $3.04 per share, above the $3.12 per share loss expected by analysts.","764":"BEIJING\/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O boss Elon Musk urged miners to produce more nickel, a key ingredient in the batteries that power the company's electric cars, warning the current cost of batteries remained a big hurdle to the company's growth.  FILE PHOTO: A Tesla car is seen in Los Angeles, California, U.S., July 9, 2020. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  \u201cTesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way,\u201d Musk said on a post-earnings call on Wednesday.  Nickel makes batteries energy dense so cars can run further on a single charge, and Tesla needs the metal more than ever as it looks to ramp up production of trucks and solar projects that use a lot of nickel.  Musk\u2019s call for greater nickel mining comes even as prices for battery materials wallow around rock bottom.  However, traders and analysts say the kinds of volumes Tesla would need are unlikely to make a compelling business case for miners to invest in increased production, nor are they likely to boost prices in the medium term.  Tesla currently sources nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) batteries from South Korea's LG Chem Ltd 051910.KS and nickel-cobalt-aluminium (NCA) batteries from Japan's Panasonic Corp 6752.T.  These companies indirectly buy nickel from mining companies in a long auto supply chain. Tesla doesn\u2019t disclose which nickel miners are in its supply chain.  Given Tesla\u2019s focus on sustainability, the company is likely to prefer to buy from miners of higher-grade nickel sulphide, which requires less power to process than laterite ore, said Lachlan Shaw of National Australia Bank.  There are three key suppliers - Brazil's Vale VALE3.SA, which operates in Canada using some hydropower, Russia's Norilsk Nickel GMKN.MM and BHP Group's operations BHP.AX in Western Australia. \"Vale is in the box seat,\" he said.  While electric vehicles consume a much smaller amount of nickel than traditional industries such as stainless steel makers, EVs are expected to be the quickest growth market for nickel miners.  Nickel consumption in EV battery materials is expected to soar 64% between 2019 and 2025, research firm Wood Mackensie said, although it added that satisfying this demand could be challenging for an industry that has been slow to add capacity in a timely and cost-effective manner.  \u201cHe needs nickel, so he hopes nickel prices will go lower and lower,\u201d said a China-based nickel trader. \u201cPrices will not be impacted in the short-term because the market is in surplus.\u201d  Nickel hit a 14-month low of $10,865 a tonne CMNI3 in March but has since recovered to $13,180, still down by some 30% from five-year peaks seen in September. Prices rallied 2.6 percent partly on Tesla's bullish outlook, a trader said.  Tesla on Wednesday posted a second-quarter profit, but Musk said he would prioritise growth over profit going forward, and focus on making Tesla vehicles more affordable.  \"The real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at affordable price. That's the real limit,\" Musk said, adding the company would expand its business with Panasonic 6752.T and CATL 300750.SZ and \"possibly with others\".

Tesla has set a target to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles in 2019, which means it must deliver almost 105,000 vehicles in its final quarter to meet the low end of its full-year forecast.  While supporters view Tesla as a growth stock, analysts on average expect the company to report a 7% drop in revenue and a non-GAAP loss of $82 million for the September quarter, according to Refinitiv data. Full-year revenue is seen increasing 15%, far less than Tesla\u2019s revenue growth of over 80% in 2018.  \u201cGiven the decelerating revenue growth in 2019 and ongoing gross margin pressure, we expect net losses to exceed the losses in 2018, placing more pressure on what we see as an already expensive valuation,\u201d Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill wrote in a client note on Thursday.  The Model 3 sedan was meant to propel Tesla to sustainable profitability, but that has yet to happen during the car\u2019s two years on the market. While production problems initially hampered sales, some investors now worry about soft demand for the vehicle, as well as waning sales of its higher-end vehicles that are more profitable for Tesla.  Musk has pushed back his target of turning a profit a number of times, most recently targeting the fourth quarter of 2019, with the September quarter to be break-even.  Many on Wall Street have grown skeptical of Musk\u2019s pronouncements, such as his prediction last April that self-driving Tesla taxis would be available in some U.S. markets next year.  Underscoring investors\u2019 doubts about Tesla\u2019s progress with autonomous-driving technology, a U.S. regulator said on Wednesday it was looking into parking lot crashes involving Tesla cars driving themselves to their owners using a recently launched Smart Summon feature.  After slumping in early 2019, Tesla\u2019s stock has stabilized since June, but it remains down 31% year to date.  To turn profitable, Musk has put a lid on costs while investing in initiatives such as building a $2 billion factory in Shanghai, as well as planned future models, such as the Model Y SUV and a commercial truck.  Tesla aims to start production at its China factory this month, but it is unclear when it will meet year-end production targets due to uncertainties around orders, labor and suppliers, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.  \u201cThe company has yet to prove it can produce its vehicles at scale profitability, and we question management\u2019s projections of what the steady state of demand is for the current product lineup and roadmap,\u201d Cowen analysts wrote in a note to clients.","766":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O Chief Executive Elon Musk has said Sept.15 is the tentative date for the company's shareholder meeting as well as \"Battery Day\", at which the electric-car maker is expected to reveal significant advances in battery technology.

An existing $7,500 U.S. tax credit for electric vehicles (EVs), which allows taxpayers to deduct a part of the cost of buying an electric car, phases out over 15 months once an automaker hits 200,000 cumulative EV sales, which Tesla hit in July 2018.

Model 3 registrations, which accounted for about three-fourth of the total, halved to 10,694.  Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.  \u201cOne can assume that Tesla has hit peak performance in the U.S. because they have not exceeded their 2018 results for five months now,\u201d said Shane Marcum, vice-president of Cross-Sell.

Tesla shares recovered to $266.13, up 3 percent, Thursday after a sell-off prompted by a Moody\u2019s debt downgrade and news that safety regulators are investigating a Model X-involved fatality.  In an email to employees viewed by Reuters, Tesla Senior Vice President of Engineering Doug Fields wrote that production of Tesla vehicles is \u201cwell into the 200\u2019s on every single line.\u201d  Field gave reasons why Tesla needs to get to 2,500 vehicles a week, including: \u201cThere are an incredible number of people who \u2018short\u2019 Tesla stock, which means they profit when we fail. And lately the story is the same: \u2018Tesla can\u2019t do high-volume production\u2019. I find that personally insulting, and you should too. Let\u2019s make them regret ever betting against us.\u201d  Tesla must \u201cquickly break through the 300 cars\/day barrier, and keep going,\u201d the email continued.  Tesla did not immediately comment on the email, which was previously reported by Bloomberg News.  Doubts that Tesla could meet its production targets and concerns about cash reserves were behind Moody\u2019s downgrade of Tesla last week. The ratings agency cited the likelihood of a new capital raise, which it estimated at over $2 billion, in part to cover approximately $1.2 billion in convertible bonds coming due by March 2019.  The downgrade, together with a fatality involving a Model X that is currently being investigated by safety regulators, sent shares down 12 percent for the week, even after Thursday\u2019s rebound. That made it Tesla\u2019s worst week in nine months.  Tesla shares are still above the $255.73 level, the price when Tesla last announced a capital raise in March last year to raise $1.15 billion.  Moody\u2019s and other analysts have predicted Tesla will soon have to sell more shares to replenish cash reserves and pay for expansion of Model 3 production and new vehicles such as the Tesla Semi electric commercial truck and a compact sport utility vehicle.  As of Dec. 31, Tesla had $3.4 billion in cash and securities. Moody\u2019s estimated approximately $500 million in cash was needed for normal operations and forecast cash burn this year of about $2 billion.  Beyond the $2 billion that Moody\u2019s predicted Tesla would seek in the near-term, it said the company would likely need to raise additional capital during the second half of 2019.  Chief Executive Elon Musk has promised to build 10,000 Model 3s per week by some point in 2018 after meeting a 5,000-per week target by the end of the second quarter. Tesla built only 2,425 Model 3s in its fourth quarter.

The company maintained its profit forecast for the year through March at 300 billion yen, compared with an average estimate of 293.94 billion yen from 19 analysts.  Panasonic has turned its focus away from low-margin consumer electronics and bet on businesses that sell to automakers as well as to corporations such as factory-owners and firms that automate processes.  But the shift has failed to lift profits at a time when the U.S.-China trade war has hit industrial purchases and output, and the global car market is contracting.  Tesla is also yet to show sustained profits.

S3 said the day\u2019s losses pushed the aggregate year-to-date performance of short-sellers in Tesla into the red. Short-sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price. Tesla is the most shorted U.S. stock.  Tesla short-sellers had been up $276 million in year-to-date mark-to-market profits prior to the day\u2019s rally, and the short-sellers\u2019 paper losses have now swelled to $831 million for the year, S3 data showed.  \u201cWe are not seeing a large amount of buy to covers yet,\u201d said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 in New York, referring to traders buying shares to close out an existing short position.  \u201cWith such a large price move on the open, most short sellers that are looking to cover are waiting for a retracement before placing buy-to-cover orders,\u201d he said.  Tesla shares were up 14.5 percent at $344.5 in late afternoon trading, a day after the company said it would produce its new Model 3 sedan at a profit, following several recent weeks in which output had stabilized.  The update buoyed hopes that the company led by Elon Musk will stanch its losses.  Tesla\u2019s rapid cash burn and struggles at turning a profit have made it a favorite target for shorts, including some big names such as Jim Chanos, head of Kynikos Associates, and Billionaire hedge fund manager David Einhorn\u2019s Greenlight Capital fund.  Since the beginning of 2016, Tesla is the fourth worst performing U.S. short bet, and short-sellers have lost $4.70 billion on a net basis over that period, according to S3 data.  A sharp rally in the electric car maker\u2019s shares since early April has hurt short-sellers.  On Tuesday, Einhorn told investors that his bet against the stock had turned into heavy second-quarter losses at his Greenlight Capital fund.  \u201cLong term short sellers will probably shrug off this loss, as they were down billions in the past and not only kept their positions but built them up,\u201d said S3 Partners\u2019 Dusaniwsky.  \u201cBut I would imagine shorter term momentum short sellers would be quick on the trigger to exit their positions after suffering a 10 percent loss in just one day,\u201d he said.","772":"(Reuters) - A federal judge narrowed Tesla Inc's TSLA.O lawsuit against a former employee it accused of hacking into its computers and leaking proprietary data to a reporter.

But she refused to dismiss some other Tesla claims, including that Tripp\u2019s alleged unauthorized use of data might have violated a Nevada computer crimes law, and that his conduct justified punitive damages.

Chief Executive Elon Musk\u2019s announcement on Thursday that the electric vehicle maker would close \u201cmany\u201d of its stores around the world to sell cars online-only removes the only retail outlet for solar sales since Musk pulled the plug on a partnership with Home Depot last June.  \u201cSolar is now the stepchild at Tesla. They\u2019ve made two decisions in a row that deal crippling blows to the solar business and they may be regretting the Home Depot idea,\u201d said Frank Gillett, principal analyst at Forrester Research. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel thoughtfully done, it\u2019s rushed. Basically it will hurt them from a brand and marketing point of view,\u201d Gillett said.  When Tesla made its offer for SolarCity - a debt-laden solar-panel sales and installation company founded by two of Musk\u2019s cousins - its stock price was down 70 percent from its all-time high. Musk cast the deal as a \u201cno-brainer\u201d rife with synergies, in which customers could be sold both cars and solar energy systems.  That has not yet proven to be the case, and Tesla\u2019s solar business has been shrinking as selling the Model 3 sedan became Tesla\u2019s priority. As part of company-wide layoffs last June, Tesla closed about a dozen solar installation facilities.  Tesla said all sales for its energy and solar products around the world would now be online only, too.  \u201cThe majority of our residential solar and Powerwall orders are already placed outside our retail stores, including online or via referral, and we believe this shift to online sales, paired with a dedicated energy adviser from our support team, will result in the best, most seamless customer experience in the industry,\u201d a Tesla spokesman told Reuters.  Tesla cited a cut in prices of its residential solar systems by as much as 25 percent in November, representing savings of between $3,000-$5,000 on average, helped by streamlining its sales operations, and said the shift to online sales would unlock additional cost efficiencies. [nL2N1XQ1O6  Ending the deal with Home Depot, whose stores generate high foot traffic, took a huge bite out of Tesla solar sales. In the fourth quarter, the company deployed 73 megawatts of retrofit solar systems, down 21 percent from the prior quarter and well below SolarCity\u2019s more than 200 megawatts a quarter in early 2016. Total energy generation and storage revenue fell 7 percent from the prior quarter to $371.5 million.  Besides selling private-label and third-party solar panels, Tesla sells energy storage systems for home and business use, so-called Powerwalls and Powerpacks. Tesla has said nearly all Powerwall-only orders are placed via the web or certain third-party solar installers.  Installations of the solar roof tiles unveiled by Musk in 2016 are at a \u201cslow pace,\u201d Tesla said in its 2018 annual report, due to design changes. Progress at Tesla\u2019s solar factory in Buffalo, New York, where the tiles are to be manufactured, meanwhile, has been stalled by assembly-line problems.  One former solar seller laid off in January told Reuters that 70 percent of leads on solar had come from Home Depot. Upper management at Tesla \u201cdidn\u2019t appreciate the significance\u201d of the deal with the big-box retailer, the source said.  \u201cIf you want to go mass volume, you have to go after the customers,\u201d the source said. \u201cSolar isn\u2019t sexy enough to have the customer come to you.\u201d  Musk said Tesla will still keep open a small number of stores in high-traffic locations as galleries and information centers, where details about energy products will also be offered.  When customers order a car on Tesla\u2019s website, they are alerted during the configuration process to the possibility of ordering solar or other energy products.  In January, Tesla said it was \u201cstill in the process of transitioning our sales channel from former partners to our Tesla stores and training our sales team to sell solar systems in addition to vehicles.\u201d  But former solar salespeople told Reuters that Tesla had already put solar on the back burner, with Tesla-branded panels not even available for installations in the latter half of 2018.  \u201cThey\u2019d tell us the focus of the company is the Model 3,\u201d said one former seller, who left the company in January. \u201cThe Model 3 has to be successful or there\u2019s no company.\u201d (Reporting by Alexandria Sage; Editing by Greg Mitchell and Leslie Adler)","774":"TOKYO (Reuters) - A pickup in production of Tesla Inc's TSLA.O Model 3 cars, after earlier delays, has resulted in occasional battery cell shortages, a Panasonic Corp 6752.T official said on Thursday in a sign Tesla is in overdrive to meet its end-June forecast.

Panasonic is the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla\u2019s current production models, producing them in Japan as well as at Tesla\u2019s so-called Gigafactory in the U.S. state of Nevada, which Panasonic jointly operates.  It also has a joint plant with Tesla to produce solar cells and modules at a new factory in Buffalo, New York.  But tying its fortunes to Tesla\u2019s, which has struggled with production bottlenecks, has sometimes looked like a risky bet.  A fatal crash in California earlier this year involving a Tesla car and another one in Florida last year has drawn regulatory scrutiny and hurt shares.  Tesla said earlier this month that it was cutting several thousand jobs across the company as it seeks to reduce costs and become profitable, without endangering the critical production ramp-up for the sedan, a closely watched metric.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say the delay (in Tesla\u2019s Model 3 production) had no impact on our business, but we are in close communications with Tesla and working to steadily improve production,\u201d Ito said.  Panasonic sees batteries as central to its plan to boost automotive business revenue to 2.5 trillion yen by the year through March 2022 from 1.8 trillion yen ($16.3 billion)estimated for this financial year.  To reduce the risk of over-relying on Tesla, Panasonic has teamed up with Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T to jointly develop batteries for electric vehicles.  At the shareholders meeting, Panasonic Chief Executive Kazuhiro Tsuga said all solid-state batteries, next-generation batteries considered more stable, are unlikely to hit the automotive market anytime soon, even though the company was engaged in their development.  \u201cWe believe we can continue to improve performance of today\u2019s lithium-ion batteries at least until around 2025,\u201d Tsuga said.

The capital expenditure cost of Gigafactory 3 is estimated to be $2 billion, Musk said on the conference call.  Tesla will need to raise debt because manufacturing challenges have left the company with a shortage of cash.

Wall Street analysts and investors have raised doubts about demand and the Silicon Valley automaker\u2019s ability to sort out recent delivery issues, particularly after a disastrous first quarter when deliveries slumped 31%.  \u201cWe are increasingly comfortable that they should reflect an even better in the third quarter, and probably their first hundred thousand in a quarter,\u201d Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said.  Tesla delivered a record number of 95,200 vehicles in the second quarter, beating analysts\u2019 average estimates, but did not comment on when it would return to a profit.  Shares of Tesla were set to open at their highest in two months. Up to Tuesday close, the stock had lost nearly one-third of its value so far this year.  Tesla\u2019s first quarter was hurt by logistics issues at its international ports and a drop-off in U.S. orders after a tax credit was halved, which spurred concerns that Tesla may have tapped a limited market for electric cars at premium prices.  While Musk has been trying to convince investors that demand remains high for Tesla cars and delivery could be made efficiently, some analysts remained skeptical about Tesla\u2019s ability to deliver on its promise.  The CEO has repeatedly said Tesla could deliver a record number of cars in the second quarter, beating the 90,700 it sent to customers in the final quarter of last year.  In the quarter, Tesla delivered 77,550 Model 3s - seen as linchpin for its growth into a mass-market company. That compared with analysts\u2019 average estimate of 73,144, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  \u201cThese are undeniably strong numbers, but given Tesla\u2019s recent history of significant swings in performance from quarter-to-quarter we remain cautious for now,\u201d Nicholas Hyett, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said.

Details of the agreement were unclear. In Chinese, a preliminary agreement could refer to mere acknowledgment through to a statement of intent.  The talks come as Tesla looks to localize battery cell production in the face of mounting competition from a swathe of domestic EV makers in the world\u2019s largest car market, where a Sino-U.S. trade war is increasing the cost of U.S. imports.  Tesla said it received quotes from Tianjin Lishen to supply batteries for the Shanghai plant but did not proceed further.  \u201cWe have not signed any agreement of any kind with them,\u201d a Tesla spokeswoman told Reuters.  Lishen told Reuters that it had not signed any agreement with Tesla to supply batteries to the factory.  The first source reiterated that a preliminary agreement was signed. The second source said Tesla\u2019s supplier certification process usually took a long time to be finalised. The people declined to be identified because the discussions were private.  Japan's Panasonic Corp 6752.T is currently Tesla's exclusive battery cell supplier. Its shares closed down 2.7 percent after the Reuters report. It also announced a joint venture with Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Tuesday to make electric vehicle (EV) batteries.  Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said in November the U.S. company would manufacture all its battery modules and packs at the Shanghai factory and planned to diversify its sources.  \u201cCell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner,\u201d Musk said in a tweet in November.  Panasonic said in a statement it was studying various possibilities with regards to Tesla\u2019s Shanghai plant, but nothing had been decided. It declined to comment on the possibility of losing exclusive-supplier status with Tesla.  Other battery makers in the running for contracts could include Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd 300750.SZ and LG Chem Ltd 051910.KS.  Tesla broke ground on the $2 billion so-called Gigafactory, its first in China, earlier this month and plans to begin making Model 3 electric vehicles (EV) there by the end of the year.  Musk has said the factory will produce \u201cmore affordable\u201d vehicles for the Chinese auto market.  APPLE SUPPLIER  Lishen, which says its clients range from Apple AAPL.O and Samsung Electronics 005930.KS to Geely 0175.HK and Hyundai Motor 005380.KS, has joined other battery makers in aggressively pursuing contracts with the rapidly growing EV industry.

Panasonic and Toyota on Tuesday announced a joint venture that leverages the heft of one of the world\u2019s largest automakers and one of the world\u2019s biggest battery makers to expand their EV push.  The joint venture builds on the agreement that the pair announced in late 2017 on joint development of batteries with higher energy density in a prismatic cell arrangement.  It would also help Panasonic cut its heavy reliance on Tesla, whose production delays have weighed on the Japanese company\u2019s earnings.  Panasonic planned to shift most of its prismatic battery-related equipment and facilities in Japan and China to the joint venture, while those producing batteries for Tesla would remain under the company, a source said.","783":"Tesla Inc.

In recent months, Tesla\u2019s shares have had a run of good fortune on the back of a rare quarterly profit reported in October, news of production ramp-up in its China factory and upbeat early deposits for its recently launched electric pickup truck.  Orders for the company\u2019s Cybertruck have reached close to the record set by its Model 3 sedans in 2016.  \"Whoa \u2026 the stock is so high lol,\" Musk tweeted on Monday, after Tesla shares crossed the $420 mark.

FILE PHOTO: SpaceX founder Elon Musk pauses at a press conference following the first launch of a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S., February 6, 2018. REUTERS\/Joe Skipper\/File Photo  With a debt load of about $10.5 billion and the possibility of an impending cash shortfall, Wall Street expects the luxury electric carmaker may need to raise funds before long.  Tesla Chief Executive Musk said late on Friday he would heed shareholder concerns and no longer pursue a $72 billion take-private deal, abandoning an idea that stunned investors and may draw regulatory scrutiny.  None of that has done anything to help it with a looming issue: cash.  Tesla, which has had just one quarter of positive free cash flow since the fourth quarter of 2013, has $1.3 billion in debt coming due in the next 12 months. Meanwhile it has just $1.3 billion of cash on hand after backing out $942 million of customer deposits on cars.  With analysts forecasting a slowed, but continued, cash burn in the second half of 2018, Tesla may need to borrow up to $2 billion by the end of the year to stay afloat.  In response to a request for comment, a Tesla representative referred to Musk\u2019s statement on the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call when he said the company planned to pay its convertible debt with internally generated cash flow.  DEBT RAISING  The most likely option, according to analysts, is a convertible debt issue. Musk has historically favored convertible bonds to raise capital, and Tesla and its SolarCity unit each have three issues of convertible senior notes, worth a total of $4.2 billion.  Convertibles give owners the right to trade their debt for equity after shares rise over a certain price. They allow holders to benefit from a rising share price, while also offering bond-like protection if it falls.  The one challenge of using more convertible debt, however, is \u201cthat it drives more short sellers to your stock. And Musk does not want that,\u201d said Jeffrey Osborne, senior research analyst, Cowen Inc.  Frequently, convertible bond owners will hedge their positions by selling the underlying stock short. Moreover, the dilution caused by conversion could also pressure a stock, drawing the interest of short sellers.  Of the $1.3 billion Tesla has coming due in the next 12 months, $230 million is from a SolarCity convertible due on Nov. 1, and another $920 million from a Tesla convertible due on March 1, 2019. Tesla\u2019s shares, at $319.27, are a long way from the $560.64 needed to convert the SolarCity debt but have traded above the $359.87 March 2019 debt conversion price.  Musk could also choose to offer convertible bond investors the opportunity to exchange their debt for equity below either or both strike prices, although that could require some assurances on the company\u2019s fundamentals.  Tesla's mountain of debt: reut.rs\/2Mwlh5z  STRAIGHT DEBT  Tesla could issue straight debt akin to the 5.3 percent coupon junk bond coming due in 2025. That bond however, is trading well below par at 87.13 cents on the dollar, and so it would be unlikely that Tesla could get the sort of favorable terms they secured in their last offering.  Krishna Memani, chief investment officer of OppenheimerFunds, which is among Tesla\u2019s top 10 bondholders, said that the level of scrutiny Musk would have to go through \u201cwould be meaningfully higher in any new issuance.\u201d  EQUITY  Equity markets have historically been friendly to Tesla, however Musk said, on the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call, that he would not tap them for cash. \u201cWe\u2019ll not be raising any equity at any point... I have no expectation of doing so; do not plan to do so.\u201d  The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened an investigation into Musk for potentially misleading investors when he tweeted that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d for a $420 a share take-private deal, according to media reports.  LEASE\/ASSET-BACKED SECURITY DEAL  Tesla could securitize automotive leases backed by drivers\u2019 monthly payments as it did earlier this year when it sold $546 million of bonds backed by leases on Model S and Model X cars.  There are two problems with issuing new asset-backed securities.  The first is that old vehicles may not sell for as much as expected given the increasing competition Tesla is facing in the electric vehicle space. Second, leases as a percentage of vehicles sold have fallen dramatically as it is not possible to lease a Model 3 sedan. While roughly 20 percent to 30 percent of Model S and Model Xs were leased, the Model 3 must be paid for in cash.","786":"(Corrects price to $39,900 from $39,000 in paragraph 2)  Nov 25 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc shares rose 4% on Monday after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted over the weekend that the company had already received 200,000 orders for its futuristic Cybertruck pickup.

A wheel of a prototype of the Tesla Model 3 on display in front of the factory during a media tour of the Tesla Gigafactory, which will produce batteries for the electric carmaker in Sparks, Nevada, U.S. July 26, 2016. REUTERS\/James Glover II\/File Photo  A former member of Tesla\u2019s internal investigations team, Karl Hansen, filed a tips, complaints and referrals form to the SEC about the Gigafactory on Aug. 9, Hansen\u2019s attorney Stuart Meissner said in a news release. Whistleblowers can receive 10 percent to 30 percent of penalties the SEC collects.  Tesla said it took the allegations that Hansen brought to the electric car maker seriously and investigated.  \u201cSome of his claims are outright false. Others could not be corroborated,\u201d Tesla said in the statement.  The SEC declined comment.  The complaint sent to the SEC comes amid intense focus on the company and Chief Executive Elon Musk, whose tweets about taking the company private last week set off a scramble to determine whether he violated securities law in stating that funding for the deal was \u201csecured.\u201d  Hansen alleged that Tesla, at the direction of Musk, installed surveillance equipment at the Gigafactory outside Reno, Nevada to eavesdrop on the personal cellphones of employees while at work, according to Meissner.  Hansen also claims that Tesla did not disclose to investors that thieves stole $37 million in copper and other raw materials during the first half of 2018, according to his attorney.  Hansen alleges Tesla failed to disclose that it received written notice from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration about a Tesla employee possibly engaged in selling cocaine and crystal methamphetamine from the Nevada factory on behalf of a Mexican drug cartel, according to Meissner who did not release the whistleblower filing he said his client made to the SEC.  Reuters could not reach Hansen for comment.  Hansen alleges that he found ties between the Tesla employee and members of the cartel and urged Tesla to disclose that information to the DEA, his attorney said in the news release.  The DEA said it does not notify non-law enforcement entities about investigations.  \u201cNotifying associates of a target of an investigation would likely derail enforcement efforts or compromise the investigation altogether,\u201d the agency said in a statement.  Sheriff Gerald Antinoro of Storey County, where the Gigafactory is located, declined to comment on the allegations of drug dealing. The sheriff did say Tesla reported two thefts but did not disclose what was taken.  \u201cTesla refused to do so and instead advised him that Tesla would hire \u2018outside vendors\u2019 to further investigate the issue,\u201d Meissner said in the news release.  Hansen was subject to retaliation and fired on July 16 after raising the issues internally, he said.  Hansen is the second Tesla employee to file a whistleblower complaint with the SEC.  Martin Tripp, another former Gigafactory worker represented by Meissner, told the SEC that Tesla inflated the number of Model 3s being produced each week, that it used punctured batteries in its vehicles, and that it reused scrapped parts in vehicles \u201cwithout regard to safety,\u201d according to his attorney.  Tesla denies those claims.  Tripp\u2019s tip to the SEC was filed after he was fired, sued by Tesla for hacking trade secrets and transferring internal documents to third parties.  Musk, in a company-wide email, accused an unnamed Telsa employee of \u201cquite extensive and damaging sabotage to our operations.\u201d","788":"SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 24 (Reuters) - When Tesla Inc posts third-quarter results on Wednesday, Chief Executive Elon Musk may show off a long-promised quarterly profit, as production of his Model 3 electric sedan takes off. But the real question is whether any such gains will be sustainable.  Since May, Musk has pledged to post quarterly profits in the second half of this year as it gained traction with production, and deliveries, of its new Model 3 sedan.  The results end a turbulent quarter in which U.S. security regulators accused Musk of securities fraud for misleading tweets and forced him to forgo the chairman role in a settlement.  Short sellers who bet against the company celebrated - until noted short-seller Citron Research on Tuesday reversed course, saying it believed the Model 3 was a \u201cproven hit.\u201d  \u201cWhile the media has been focused on Elon Musk\u2019s eccentric, outlandish and at times offensive behavior, it has failed to notice the legitimate disruption of the auto industry that is currently being dominated by Tesla,\u201d Citron wrote.  Tesla has been trying to minimize spending and maximize revenue, cutting jobs and restructuring while trying to fast-track vehicle deliveries of the Model 3 to customers, to meet a promise to be cash flow positive and profitable in the third and fourth quarters.  Tesla scheduled its earnings release earlier than usual - most likely, because it is expecting to report a profit, Mainstay Capital Management strategist David Kudla said.  The chief question for investors will be whether Tesla is profitably building the new Model 3, which would mean that its earnings would rise as volume improves. Model 3 margins first turned \u201cslightly positive\u201d in the second quarter, Tesla said, after months of manufacturing problems.  Tesla delivered 55,840 Model 3s in the third quarter, worth more than $3 billion in revenue at $59,000 per car - the average price paid without add-ons. That\u2019s a rise from $1 billion in the second quarter.  More sales of the higher-priced versions of the Model 3, which carry fatter margins, will help profitability. The all-wheel drive and performance versions help get Tesla closer to its goal of third-quarter Model 3 margins of 15 percent, with 20 percent margins expected for the fourth.  Musk also could face questions of whether he will introduce a $35,000 Model 3, which Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said was a double-edged sword: if Tesla doesn\u2019t, some customers will be angry, and if it does, margins likely will be further pressured.  Investors are likely to look hard for one-off boosters to the bottom line.  Tesla gets \u201czero emission vehicle\u201d credits for its electric cars and can sell them to other manufacturers that have to meet California regulatory goals. It may have been stockpiling them, since it has posted only a gain of $50 million in such credits this year, versus the $360 million it booked in 2017.  Such credit sales pushed Tesla to a profit in its third-quarter of 2016, one of two times it has been in the black so far.  If Tesla cuts capital expenditures, research and development on upcoming vehicles or new hiring, investors will ask whether that reflects improving efficiency or delay of necessary spending.  Musk also has promised to be cash flow positive, and investors will watch whether its rocky delivery system is improving. Shortening the time cars are in transit so that revenue can hit the books more quickly would shorten its cash conversion cycle, boosting cash flow.  The outspoken CEO also is sure to be pressed on the claim, repeated since April, that Tesla has no need to raise new capital. It is a claim that some analysts have questioned, given the funding needs for the many projects on Tesla\u2019s radar, which include a Model Y SUV, a heavy-duty truck and a new factory in China.  Some analysts have estimated the company will need to raise $2 billion by the end of 2018 to fund operations and the nearly $1.8 billion in debt coming due by November 2019. The company has about $9.5 billion in long-term debt.

REUTERS\/Evgenia Novozhenina  Although bitcoin has become more of a household name in recent years, it is still mostly used as an investment product rather than a form of payment.  A handful of mainstream brands have allowed customers to make purchases with bitcoin through third-party processors, but Tesla suggested it might accept bitcoin directly as part of a broader plan to incorporate the cryptocurrency into its investment portfolio.  The company made the disclosures in a section of its quarterly securities filing that also detailed its purchase of $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin. If customers buy Teslas with bitcoin, the company may or may not liquidate those payments right away - which some experts read as an indication that Tesla might hold on to at least some of the coins and not sell them automatically.  A Tesla representative did not immediately respond to a request for more details.  If Tesla were to accept bitcoin payments the way some other major companies have, customers would transfer bitcoins from their \u201cdigital wallets\u201d to another entity that converts them into, say, dollars and sends the sum to Tesla.  For example, companies including AT&T Inc and Microsoft Corp have accepted bitcoin through BitPay, a cryptocurrency payment processor.

Shoppers can also buy items from merchants that have never officially accepted bitcoin by using payment cards that convert the cryptocurrency into U.S. dollars ahead of the transaction.  One digital currency enthusiast, Mason Borda, told Reuters he bought a Tesla Model 3 in 2016 using bitcoin through a company called Shakepay. It allowed him to load up a one-time-use credit card with his bitcoin. Tesla received a cash payment.  Borda, chief executive of cryptocurrency software company TokenSoft, said he regrets the purchase, because of how bitcoin values have soared. When Borda bought the car, each bitcoin was worth about $400. As of Monday, however, it was worth over $44,000. That means the $130,000 spent on the vehicle would be worth more than $14 million in bitcoin today.  \u201cI recommend against purchasing big-ticket items with Bitcoin,\u201d he said. The \u201cnovelty\u201d of doing so can quickly fade if the price rises dramatically, he said.  Tesla may eliminate the middle man and create its own processing system that can be used to accept bitcoin and liquidate the payments whenever management chooses to, experts said.  That would be an unusual step, because bitcoin is so volatile: even payments giant PayPal Holdings Inc, which expects to allow cryptocurrencies on its network by mid-year, will settle transactions through Paxos Trust Company - meaning neither the merchant nor PayPal will have to hold the virtual coins.  Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk, who also helped launch PayPal, has expressed enthusiasm about cryptocurrencies online and industry sources say he has the technological expertise to build the required infrastructure.  If Tesla goes that route, customers would transfer bitcoin into the automaker\u2019s own system. The company will probably have to set a guaranteed exchange rate with customers for a very short period of time, said CoinShares Chairman Danny Masters.  \u201cThey will likely continue to price Teslas in dollars and then say, \u2018Wire us dollars or send us bitcoin and if you send us bitcoin, the price is good for five minutes,\u2019\u201d he said.","795":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc\u2019s vice president of production at its Fremont factory, Peter Hochholdinger, has left after three years with the electric-car maker, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.

He was tasked with improving production for Tesla's luxury Model S sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle as well as helping build a cost-effective manufacturing program for the Model 3 sedan, the company had said reut.rs\/2KFSyd2 in his appointment memo.  At Volkswagen, Hochholdinger spent 22 years supervising the production of Audi A4, A5 and Q5 models. When Audi set up a new production facility in Mexico, he served as an adviser.  Both Tesla and Hochholdinger did not respond to requests for comment.  Demand for Tesla cars has been one of the major concerns of investors amid escalating U.S.-China trade tensions. The company reported a 31% fall in first-quarter deliveries and warned that profit would be delayed until the latter half of the year.  Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, however, said last month that the company was on course to deliver a record number of cars in the second quarter.  Musk reiterated the claim on Tuesday after automotive news website Electrek reported that the company faces delivery bottlenecks at the close of the second quarter.  Electrek was also the first to report here on Hochholdinger's exit from Tesla.  Earlier on Wednesday, Wedbush analysts lowered their current quarter delivery forecast to 84,000 units from an earlier forecast of 88,000 units, adding that Tesla hitting its quarterly delivery target is an \u201cunlikely event\u201d.

LATEST  - Tesla  - OPEC  DEALERS OR NO DEALERS. Fresh from zooming past Toyota Motor to become the world\u2019s most valuable carmaker, Tesla on Thursday unveiled surprisingly good global sales numbers for the second quarter. Elon Musk\u2019s Silicon Valley upstart delivered almost 91,000 vehicles, some 5% lower than the same period last year, despite a coronavirus-prompted production shutdown and a roughly one-third drop in U.S. sales at Ford Motor and General Motors.  It probably helped that Tesla models are quite expensive, so buyers may have been more immune to Covid-19\u2019s economic fallout. But the electric-car maker, unlike traditional rivals, is not reliant on dealerships to hawk its vehicles, so already kept human contact to a minimum. Neither that resilience nor its longer-term sales outlook can justify Tesla shares trading at more than 70 times estimated 2022 earnings, using Refinitiv data. But it has conferred another useful advantage on Musk\u2019s firm. (By Antony Currie)  HERDING CATS. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries\u2019 July 15 meeting is shaping up to be a corker. OPEC and allies like Russia have since May cut global supply by 9.7 million barrels per day to offset an epic coronavirus-related demand slump. But laggards like Nigeria and Angola have been letting the side down by pumping more than their fair share.  De facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia wants the miscreants to compensate for their overproduction by cutting more in future months. Lacking Riyadh-level sovereign wealth buffers, Angola is yet to play ball. Meanwhile, oil prices continue to oscillate around $40 a barrel as heartening news on falling U.S. crude stocks is offset by fears of a spike in virus infections. Saudi will do well to correctly call the right level of cuts and stop fellow oil producers getting the hump. (By George Hay)  REVERSE GEAR. Citing Covid-19, Chinese electric-car startup Byton is suspending production from July 1 to reorganise itself, and is raising funds to address unpaid salaries. That will cramp its IPO plans, and is another sign of trouble in the world\u2019s biggest EV market, which was struggling before the pandemic hit. Sales of new energy vehicles fell 23.5% year-on-year to 82,000 units in May, according to an industry association, even while overall auto sales rose 14.5%.  Byton, which has yet to sell a single car, is hardly the only cash-strapped EV maker, but its peers are faring better. New York-listed Nio announced this week it had substantially completed cash injections into its China operation, while Alibaba-backed Xpeng has started deliveries of its P7 electric sedan, which will challenge Tesla\u2019s Model 3. But barring a startling demand revival, the coronavirus looks set to accelerate consolidation. (By Sharon Lam)  RETAIL RELIEF. The death of the high street is greatly exaggerated. That\u2019s the message from Associated British Foods\u2019 latest trading update. The $21 billion owner of Primark said that although retail sales tanked 75% from March 1 to June 20, since reopening its sales were only down 12% versus last year. And in June, when 90% of its stores reopened, revenue was ahead of last year\u2019s levels in Ireland and England. Investors responded with a near-8% share bounce.  Lockdown was a boon to the grocery business. Long-life goods like Ryvita and Dorset Cereals were in high demand from housebound consumers. This delivered a 9% sales boost from March to June. A rush of sugar sales from higher prices in Europe also delivered a 3% bump since the beginning of the year. This took the edge off the lockdown hit to Primark. But with fast-fashion enthusiasts back, the retail recovery may be faster than expected. (By Aimee Donnellan)  POSH PUSH. Ikea\u2019s latest Paris shopping trip offers a glimpse of the post-pandemic future. Ingka Group, which operates the flat-pack furniture giant\u2019s stores, is splashing 130 million euros on a new store in the French capital that will flog more small accessories rather than three-seater sofas. Its choice of the wealthy Rue de Rivoli looks a punt on deeper-pocketed urban dwellers spending their cash on quick trips rather than trekking to Ikea\u2019s big warehouses.  The shift could put Ikea in good stead for a prolonged recession. Unemployment in America topped 13% in May while in Europe it was near 7% in April. With reduced cash flow, consumers may prefer to redecorate their homes rather than move altogether. Ingka\u2019s Parisian splurge is unlikely to be a one-off. The Swedish furniture group is also eyeing assets in Germany. And with rival retailers collapsing, it faces less competition.

Tesla reported quarterly profit below analysts\u2019 expectations on Wednesday and surprised investors by announcing that Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja, 56, would leave and handover the reins to 34-year-old Zach Kirkhorn, its vice president of finance.  JPMorgan analysts were among those warning that Ahuja\u2019s leaving deprived the company of long automotive industry experience and relative stability in a company which has seen a steady stream of senior staff come and go since 2016.  Analysts were also concerned by Tesla\u2019s indication that it is only making cars for China and Europe right now, and expects a gap of about 10,000 vehicles between production and deliveries due to vehicles in transit at the end of the first quarter.  \u201cThis is a strong indication that demand in the U.S. for both the mid-range and long-range Model 3 versions has largely been exhausted, and the company is still working through the estimated ~6.8k of unsold Model 3 inventory,\u201d Cowen analysts said.  Still, the fall in Tesla shares was less than that suggested by initial pricing after Wednesday\u2019s results and also far smaller than some of the swings in one of the past year\u2019s most volatile Wall Street stocks.  The company, which is striving to stabilize production and deliver consistent profit, ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash and said it had \u201csufficient cash on hand\u201d to pay a $920 million convertible bond maturing in March.  Of the 31 brokerages covering Tesla, 10 have a \u201cbuy\u201d or higher rating, 10 \u201chold\u201d and 11 have a \u201csell\u201d or lower rating and their median price target is 327.50.  Only four changed their price targets on the stock on Thursday, with two raises and two cuts. Wedbush cut its price target by $50 to $390.  While Tesla is pumping money into a Shanghai factory, which it hopes to bring on line around the end of this year with a target of producing 500,000 vehicles a year, several analysts questioned whether that investment will pay off.  \u201cTesla serves the purpose of a \u2018stalking horse\u2019 to the fast growing domestic Chinese EV industry, but we believe it has limited to zero terminal value in a region where a number of domestic champions should emerge,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts said.","802":"June 11 (Reuters) - Shares of Tesla Inc rose as much as 5 percent on Monday after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted that its Autopilot driver assistance system will get full self-driving features following a software upgrade in August.  Autopilot, a form of advanced cruise control, handles some driving tasks and warns those behind the wheel they are always responsible for the vehicle\u2019s safe operation. But a spate of recent crashes has brought the system under regulatory scrutiny.  \"To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety.

It was my opinion at the time and I stand by that opinion.\u201d  Unsworth\u2019s lawsuit focuses on three Musk tweets on July 15, 2018, five days after the diver helped complete the rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach from the cave.  Musk\u2019s first tweet questioned Unsworth\u2019s role in the rescue, while the second said, \u201cSorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.\u201d The third tweet, in response to a follower who asked Musk about the second tweet, said \u201cBet ya a signed dollar it\u2019s true.\u201d  Unsworth, 64, said the tweets harmed his reputation by branding him a pedophile and a liar, and said on Wednesday they left him \u201chumiliated, ashamed, dirtied.\u201d  His lawsuit seeks unspecified damages from Musk, who told the court this week his net worth is around $20 billion.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Legal experts are closely watching the case because it is believed to be the first major defamation lawsuit brought by a private individual to go to trial over a tweet.  Musk, 48, who was questioned throughout the afternoon on Tuesday by Unsworth\u2019s lawyer, has maintained his composure. He apologized to Unsworth, and suggested to jurors the stress of working 80 to 100 hours a week during a challenging period for Tesla contributed to the outburst.  Jurors are expected to begin deliberations Friday after Judge Stephen Wilson formally instructs them before the two sides give closing arguments. Wilson rejected a motion from Musk\u2019s lawyers to dismiss the case.  UNSWORTH\u2019S REPUTATION  The Unsworth trial has revived discussion of Musk\u2019s erratic behavior during 2018, when he also used Twitter to float a leveraged buyout proposal for Tesla that was scuttled and ultimately led to Musk paying $20 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission complaint.  For most of this year, however, Musk, who has nearly 30 million Twitter followers, has largely kept his public comments focused on Tesla\u2019s new models and improved profitability and on the technical progress of SpaceX.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Musk\u2019s lawyers on Thursday tried to weaken the defamation argument, suggesting Unsworth\u2019s reputation was unsullied and that he even tried to profit from his role in the rescue, which won him plaudits from the Thai and British governments.  Asked if there was talk of his being a pedophile at a 10 Downing Street event where he stood next to Theresa May, then Britain\u2019s prime minister, Unsworth said: \u201cNot that I recall.\u201d  Unsworth\u2019s legal team called expert witness Jim Jansen who said the Musk tweets were disseminated widely in the news media - 490 English language articles in 33 countries.  They also called Unsworth\u2019s estranged wife who gave him a character endorsement, despite the fact that Unsworth is living with his girlfriend part of the time in Thailand.  The \u201cpedo-guy\u201d tweet was \u201ctotally false\u201d, she said.  In his own testimony, Musk dismissed his tweets as an \u201coff the cuff\u201d response to watching a replay of Unsworth\u2019s CNN interview, at a time he felt overworked from running Tesla, which makes electric cars, and SpaceX, a rocket company that offered the mini-submarine.  To win his lawsuit, Unsworth needs to show Musk was negligent in publishing a falsehood that clearly identified him and caused him harm. He does not need to show that Musk acted with \u201cactual malice,\u201d which is much tougher to prove.","804":"FILE PHOTO: Tesla electric vehicles for test driving are parked in Hanam, South Korea, July 6, 2020.

FILE PHOTO: Tesla Motors Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk pauses during a news conference in Tokyo September 8, 2014. REUTERS\/Toru Hanai\/File Photo  CEO Elon Musk\u2019s suggestion on Tuesday that he wanted to take Tesla private at $420 a share, putting a value of $72 billion on the carmaker, had some investors wondering whether getting such a huge deal completed would signal that Wall Street has become overheated after nearly a decade of gains following the 2008 financial crisis.  \u201cA mega-LBO of a company notorious for its cash burn rate would be the clear sign that this is the ultimate market top,\u201d Mike O\u2019Rourke, Chief Market Strategist at JonesTrading, wrote in a client note. \u201cThis is the type of behavior often witnessed at market extremes.\u201d  Still, others took the opposite view, seeing Tesla as an exception to the rule. The company draws both love and hate on Wall Street, being simultaneously favored by institutional investors like Fidelity and also the most heavily shorted major stock on the market.  \u201cI don\u2019t think that the Tesla news tells us much of anything about the broader market,\u201d said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas. \u201cInstead, it is just a reflection of Elon Musk\u2019s personality and how much he hates being accountable to shareholders and short-term measures of success.\u201d  Indeed, a deal is far from done and may never materialize. Pointing to the rate at which Tesla is burning through cash, growing competition from other electric carmakers, and its difficulty hitting production targets, analysts and investors were skeptical that lenders would be willing to finance what would likely be the largest leveraged buyout in U.S. history.  In addition, leveraged buyouts usually depend on growing earnings to determine how much debt can be serviced to complete the buyout, but Tesla has never yet produced an annual profit, so dealmakers said any buyout transaction for Tesla could probably not involve placing much more debt on the company.  Tesla lost nearly $2 billion last year as it struggled to ramp up production of its Model 3 sedan, and while Musk said last week that the company would become consistently profitable starting in the September quarter, he has failed to reach many targets in the past.  VALUE EXPLOSION  Compared with its peers, Tesla\u2019s valuation has had a runaway ride. At $63 billion, Tesla\u2019s stock market value is already larger than General Motors, at $53 billion.  Reflecting shareholders\u2019 expectations that Tesla will grow its production exponentially, its market capitalization is equivalent to about $626,000 for every car it sold last year, compared to GM\u2019s valuation of about $5,500 per car it sold.  If Musk\u2019s deal were to be done, it would be larger than the $44 billion buyout of TXU Corp in 2007, which was the largest ever, and would even top it in inflation-adjusted terms of $55 billion.  Musk\u2019s $420 per share deal would also top the 1988 $30 billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco, now seen by many as the high-water mark of excess on Wall Street during that decade. Inflation adjusted, it would be $63 billion.  His per share price would represent a 23 percent premium over the previous day\u2019s close, although that is not that rich compared with some recent deal premiums.  A Tesla buyout at current valuations may be an ominous signal that investors are finding it difficult to find earnings growth after nearly a decade of economic recovery. Merger and acquisition activity on a quarterly basis hit multi-year peaks in 2000 and in 2007, just before significant stock market declines.  Global leveraged buyouts reached $154 billion in the first seven months of 2018, up 15 percent from the same period last year but still below the $464 billion in the first seven months of 2007, according to Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence.  \u201cIf you look at past market cycles and you look at crescendos in M&A activity or LBO activity or IPO activity ... those things tended to crest within 12 months of a market top,\u201d said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina.  \u201cWhether this is that point in time, we won\u2019t know until we get past it but it\u2019s definitely a consideration in terms of the market psychology.\u201d","811":"March 19 (Reuters) - Hundreds of Twitter users welcomed on Thursday an offer by Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, to make ventilators for coronavirus sufferers, after the United States appealed for donations of respirator masks to combat a shortage.  On Wednesday, the World Health Organization said it was in talks with China and others to help ramp up supplies of health equipment, while General Motors and Ford Motor said they were in talks with White House officials.  \u201cWe will make ventilators if there is a shortage,\u201d Musk said on Twitter, responding to a fan\u2019s suggestion that the billionaire repurpose a factory for the task.  The comment immediately drew hundreds of replies urging him to act.  \u201cIf, for whatever reason, you don\u2019t believe there currently is a shortage, by all estimates, there will be,\u201d said a social media user with the handle Internetchilla. \u201cPlease help.\u201d  The Trump administration on Tuesday urged U.S. construction companies to donate respirator masks to hospitals and healthcare providers fighting the virus, amid a nationwide shortage.  Companies such as Apple supplier Foxconn have refitted production lines to make masks and similar items after stores in many countries ran out and suppliers were overwhelmed by the spread of the virus.  An Italian start-up used a 3D printer to replicate respirator valves, saying it would hand them to hospitals for free. Italy is battling the world\u2019s worst outbreak outside China.  Last month, Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD said it was making 5 million masks and about 300,000 bottles of hand sanitizers a day.  On Wednesday, Tesla agreed to reduce the number of active workers at its California vehicle factory, a county spokesman said, amid regional lockdowns to rein in the virus.  The company employs more than 10,000 workers at its sole U.S. auto factory in Fremont.  Musk is not the first chief executive to offer help with medical supplies on Twitter, however.  SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son offered a million free virus tests this month. A day later, following criticism that he risked overwhelming medical facilities, he offered to donate a million free masks.

Musk in a conference call on Wednesday, addressing the company\u2019s largest quarterly loss to date, said the electric car maker would not need to raise more cash and that capital expenses would be slightly below $2.5 billion in 2018, lower than most analysts\u2019 estimates.  But it was his remorse for prior remarks to analysts that highlighted the call. Previously, he insulted some analysts - turning off investors and shareholders, and knocking $2 billion off the company\u2019s market cap.  \u201cI would like to apologize for being impolite on the prior call. Honestly, I think there is really no excuse for bad manners. I was kind of violating my own rule in that regard,\u201d he said.  In the previous quarter, Musk called questions posed by two analysts \u201cboring\u201d and \u201cboneheaded\u201d, and refused to answer them.  This quarter, not only was Musk\u2019s tone non-confrontational, but he apologized to both analysts.  \u201cMusk displayed a noticeably more muted tone, opening the Q&A with an apology for his behavior last quarter, and answering questions with few fireworks,\u201d said Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, who was one of the analysts targeted by Musk.  Shares of the company were up 12.2 percent to $337.68.  Tesla ended the second quarter with $2.78 billion in cash after spending $610 million in capital expenses.  Barclays analysts suggested Tesla tapped into the credit line for $458 million, which boosted its end-of-quarter cash reserves.  On Wednesday, Musk reiterated a target of producing 6,000 Model 3 sedans per week by late August. After Tesla produced 5,000 per week in July following several delays in reaching that target, analysts were concerned whether it could maintain the production rate.  \u201cAfter three quarters where investors have been in the dark with respect to estimating Model 3 volumes and margins, Q2 felt like there might finally be some light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d Evercore analysts wrote. \u201cCome Q3, we may even be able to see the end of the tunnel, or Elon\u2019s \u2018Production Hell\u2019.\u201d  Tesla had a record loss of $718 million in the second quarter, but investors and analysts focused on the positives, and more importantly on Musk\u2019s behavior on the conference call.

Most recently he ran into trouble for abusing a British caver who helped rescue 12 boys from a flooded Thailand cave.","815":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc's TSLA.O Elon Musk could settle with U.S. regulators who have sued to remove him from the electric carmaker's leadership, but he is prepared to fight the securities fraud lawsuit against him in court, sources said on Friday as shares plunged about 14 percent.  Musk, Tesla\u2019s chairman and chief executive, has been directly involved in almost every detail of its product development and technology strategy, and is credited as the driving force behind the loss-making company\u2019s ability to raise capital.  The cost of insuring Tesla debt against default rose to its highest price ever on Thursday and the plummeting share price attracted new short sellers, who bet against the stock. Short sellers notched $1.27 billion Thursday alone in paper profits, according to S3 Partners, which said Tesla recently regained the title of most-shorted U.S. stock.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused Musk on Thursday of tweeting false and misleading information in August about financing for his now-abandoned plan to take the company private, and said it was seeking to remove him as an officer or director.  The billionaire entrepreneur said he had done nothing wrong and the company\u2019s board said it supported him.  The Wall Street Journal on Friday, citing a person familiar with the matter, reported that Musk believed he had a verbal deal for financing from Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund to take Tesla private.  Musk last month in a blog said he left a July 31 meeting with the fund\u2019s managing director \u201cwith no question that a deal with the Saudi sovereign fund could be closed.\u201d  The SEC in its suit said the meeting between Musk and the fund \u201clacked discussion of even the most fundamental terms of a proposed going private transaction.\u201d  Musk, 47, walked away at the last minute from a settlement with the SEC that would have required him to give up key leadership roles at the company for two years and pay a nominal fine, according to reports on Friday.  But sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, told Reuters that while Musk was ready to go to trial he could still settle. They did not discuss possible terms.  CNBC reported that Musk had turned down an SEC deal to give up his role as chairman, while Fox Business Network reported that Musk had been offered a temporary ban as CEO.  Aeisha Mastagni, a portfolio manager for the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, a Tesla investor, said she was concerned about the board\u2019s ability to oversee Musk and the company and that she would welcome changes to Tesla\u2019s board.  \u201cI think this board is insular, ripe with conflicts; it\u2019s the poster child for bad corporate governance,\u201d she said.  The board also lacks a director who could take over for Musk, said investment adviser Cornerstone Capital\u2019s research chief, John Wilson. \u201cThe problem for investors is that an investment in Tesla is an investment in Elon Musk,\u201d he said.  Musk has hired Stephen Best at Brown Rudnick, who successfully defended internet billionaire Mark Cuban in an insider trading case, according to people familiar with the plans who also asked not to be identified. He also hired former Assistant U.S. Attorney Chris Clark of Latham & Watkins to defend him in the case, the people said.  Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The SEC declined to comment on the settlement reports.  One person with knowledge of the SEC\u2019s thinking said on Friday that the SEC civil lawsuit or a potential settlement did not preclude further action by the Justice Department, which has a higher standard of proof to make a criminal case.  The Justice Department declined to comment.  In a previous fraud case over blood-testing firm Theranos, the Justice Department brought criminal charges three months after the SEC announced its settlement with the company\u2019s founder Elizabeth Holmes.  \u201cThe SEC wouldn\u2019t delay its case for the DOJ,\u201d said Teresa Goody, CEO of law firm Goody Counsel and a former SEC attorney.  A parking sign is shown at a newly installed Tesla Super Charging station in Carlsbad, California, U.S. September 14, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  UNCERTAIN FUTURE  At least five research firms said Musk might have to resign following the SEC lawsuit.  \u201cI think it was a big mistake to turn down the settlement offer,\u201d CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson said.  Some analysts said the SEC\u2019s action was the beginning of a legal battle with authorities, short-sellers and other investors over Musk\u2019s actions that could cost Tesla heavily.  Musk has driven the company to the verge of profitability with a costly ramp-up of production of its Model 3 sedan over the past year.  Electric vehicle news site Electrek reported that Tesla had produced 51,000 Model 3s with a couple of days left in the quarter, hitting its goal of 50,000 to 55,000 Model 3s.  \u201cThe bottom line is, what he did was stupid, it was wrong, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be thrown out,\u201d said a large Tesla investor, who asked not to be identified due to sensitivity of the situation.  \u201cMy guess is he\u2019ll pay a big fine. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if as a settlement to the SEC he drops his chair of the board\u201d role.  Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at financial analytics firm S3 Partners, said in an email that he had seen several hundred thousand shares of new short selling in Tesla.  Short interest in Tesla shares totals nearly $10.2 billion, with more than 33.1 million shares sold short, roughly 26 percent of its float, he said.  Shares fell 13.9 percent to $264.77, wiping about $7 billion off Tesla\u2019s market value.

Workers carry building materials for a new Tesla showroom in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, China October 25, 2019. REUTERS\/Yilei Sun  The moves mark a departure from the approach chief executive Elon Musk announced in March, when he said the company would shut many of its retail stores worldwide to cut costs.  Tesla had already treated China, the world\u2019s biggest electric vehicle market, differently than elsewhere. The company and Musk openly disdain marketing, but in China Tesla has offered racing events and showroom parties.  \u201cBuilding cars from the Shanghai factory is just the first step,\u201d Tesla vice president Tao Lin said at an industry conference last month in Beijing. \u201cNext we must deliver cars very well to our customers and provide very good after-sales service.  Tesla plans to turn some of its showrooms in China into one-stop shops called \u201cTesla Centers\u201d that also serve as delivery sites and offer maintenance support, two sources familiar with the matter said.  The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media, said the rollout would start in Shanghai and Guangzhou.  In coming months, the company also plans to double its service centers to 63 from 29 and boost fast charging stations by 39% to 362, according to Tesla planning documents seen by Reuters.  \u201cExpanding the service network is very important to boost customer confidence,\u201d Tesla China general manager Wang Hao told Reuters, adding the firm would build more charging stations in China next year at a \u201cfaster pace.\u201d  \u201cThere is growing sales potential from more inland cities, and a need to prepare for growing repair and maintenance demands to avoid complaints,\u201d one of the sources said.  Tesla, most of whose service centers are in China\u2019s coastal regions and big provincial capitals, will open new ones in the northwestern city of Urumqi, southwestern city of Kunming and \u201cIce City\u201d Harbin in the north, the documents showed.  The sources cautioned that plans might change depending on the circumstances.  Tesla\u2019s corporate headquarters in the United States did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.  Its efforts to boost its physical presence in China comes as the carmaker has started trial production at the $2 billion Shanghai plant, its first overseas factory, ahead of mass production by the end of December.  Tesla has said it should be able to build 3,000 Model 3 sedans a week in its initial phases. That is nearly four times the number of imported Model 3 vehicles sold in China per month this year, according to figures from research firm LMC Automotive.  RISING COST BURDEN  The expansion plan is likely to increase financial strain on Tesla, which has been burning cash because of heavy losses and capital expenditure.  Tesla has had negative free cash flow every quarter but five over the past decade, but positive free cash flow of $371 million in the three months that ended in September, thanks to record deliveries and reduced costs.  It was not immediately clear how much Tesla would need to spend to expand its sales and after-sales network in China.  Tesla operates about 48 showrooms in mainland China. In contrast, BMW BMWG.DE, Daimler's DAIGn.DE Mercedes Benz, and Audi NSUG.DE, which will have electric sport-utility vehicle models in China by the end of this year, all have more than 500 sales outlets there.  Although Tesla might not need to have as many showrooms as its rivals, it should have more than it currently does, experts said.  \u201cChinese consumers are willing to examine cars in a physical store, so car manufacturers need to have a certain store network in various places,\u201d said Cui Dongshu, secretary general of China Passenger Car Association.  Maintaining growth momentum in China has become even more crucial to Tesla, as its U.S. revenue tumbled 39% in the third quarter, its first decline in more than two years. By contrast, sales in China rose 64% to $669 million.  Tesla is also expanding its sales and delivery workforce in China: It has held several hiring events in Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen for sales and delivery staff in recent months, according to recruitment advertisements posted on social media.  At a Tesla service center in Beijing, customers said more maintenance and charging facilities would encourage them to drive farther.  \u201cIt is definitely good thing. If it is convenient enough, I will drive my car to more cities,\u201d said Niu Siliang, a 60-year-old retired man who owns a Model X SUV.","817":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc has agreed to buy energy storage company Maxwell Technologies Inc for $218 million in an all-stock deal that could help the electric car maker produce batteries that hold more energy and last longer at a time when it needs to cut costs and faces growing competition.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  Tesla is rapidly increasing production of its Model 3 sedan and needs to lower the price to reach a broader customer base than its pure luxury vehicles.  Maxwell executives told investors in January that it had developed and patented a \u201cdry electrode\u201d technology that could significantly increase the driving range and reduce the cost of electric vehicle batteries. In a presentation, Maxwell said it expected strategic alliances \u201cwithin six months\u201d centered around this technology.  The company also makes ultracapacitors, which discharge energy faster than batteries and are seen as complementing battery technology.

Volvo-owner Geely Holding Group last May announced a deal with Maxwell and described the company\u2019s ultracapacitor technology as helping to deliver \u201cpeak power\u201d for hybrid cars.  \u201cTesla needs Maxwell\u2019s solvent-free battery electrode manufacturing for a viable path to lower battery costs,\u201d said Craig Irwin of Roth Capital Partners. \u201cReal competitors are coming now, so Tesla needs to move fast.\u201d  Maxwell\u2019s customers also include General Motors and Lamborghini.  The offer values each Maxwell share at $4.75, representing a 55 percent premium to the stock\u2019s closing price on Friday, the companies said. Maxwell shares rose to trade at $4.58.  Currently, Japan\u2019s Panasonic Corp is the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla cars.  Tesla chief Elon Musk had highlighted the importance of ultracapacitors back in 2013.  \"I'm a big fan of ultracapacitors. Was going to do my PhD at Stanford on them. But we need a breakthrough in energy density...,\" Musk had tweeted here.  Tesla also sells power storage, often in conjunction with its solar power business, and ultracapacitors could be used in backup systems for homes and for utility power grids.  Maxwell expects the deal, which has already been approved by its board, to close in the second quarter of 2019, or shortly thereafter.

Rowe Price Group Inc raised its stake in the electric car maker by nearly half in the July-September quarter, according to a regulatory filing on Wednesday, an apparent vote of confidence for embattled CEO Elon Musk.  A subsidiary of T. Rowe that manages the company\u2019s mutual funds increased its investment in Tesla to 10.2 percent during a tumultuous quarter for the Palo Alto, California-based car maker, highlighted by controversial tweets by Musk about taking the company private.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Musk for fraud over his tweets, and the incident clouded the company\u2019s better-than-expected quarterly results in early August, which lifted shares 16 percent in a single session.  T. Rowe Price Associates held 17.4 million shares of Tesla at the end of September, according to a filing with the SEC. It had reported it owned 11.93 million shares, equivalent to 6.99 percent, at the end of the April-June quarter, according to data from Refinitiv.  Wall Street concerns that Musk\u2019s statements on Twitter were distracting him from Tesla\u2019s main business also rose during the quarter as the Tesla chief repeatedly tweeted abuse at a British cave diver involved in the rescue of 12 Thai children.  T. Rowe Price is among Tesla\u2019s largest institutional shareholders, along with Edinburgh-based Baillie Gifford & Co and U.S. fund manager Fidelity.  A T. Rowe Price spokesman declined to comment about the company\u2019s investment in Tesla.  Tesla and Musk have agreed to pay $20 million each to financial regulators to settle charges by the SEC that Musk misled investors. As part of the agreement, Musk will step down as the company\u2019s chairman but remain as chief executive officer.  After Musk took to Twitter last Thursday to mock the SEC, Tesla\u2019s stock fell 7 percent. It has lost a quarter of its value since the end of June and is at a six-month low.  Tesla shares were down 1.79 percent at $258.10 on Wednesday.  Tesla has been struggling to ramp up production of its Model 3 sedan as older automakers including General Motors and BMW prepare their own offerings of electric vehicles.

(Reporting by Noel Randewich Editing by Paul Simao and Susan Thomas)","819":"(Repeats to widen distribution)  NEW YORK, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Elon Musk\u2019s take-private plans for Tesla Inc have evaporated, but the company\u2019s looming debt needs remain.  With a debt load of about $10.5 billion and the possibility of an impending cash shortfall, Wall Street expects the luxury electric carmaker may need to raise funds before long.  Tesla Chief Executive Musk said late on Friday he would heed shareholder concerns and no longer pursue a $72 billion take-private deal, abandoning an idea that stunned investors and may draw regulatory scrutiny.  None of that has done anything to help it with a looming issue: cash.  Tesla, which has had just one quarter of positive free cash flow since the fourth quarter of 2013, has $1.3 billion in debt coming due in the next 12 months. Meanwhile it has just $1.3 billion of cash on hand after backing out $942 million of customer deposits on cars.  With analysts forecasting a slowed, but continued, cash burn in the second half of 2018, Tesla may need to borrow up to $2 billion by the end of the year to stay afloat.  In response to a request for comment, a Tesla representative referred to Musk\u2019s statement on the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call when he said the company planned to pay its convertible debt with internally generated cash flow.  DEBT RAISING  The most likely option, according to analysts, is a convertible debt issue. Musk has historically favored convertible bonds to raise capital, and Tesla and its SolarCity unit each have three issues of convertible senior notes, worth a total of $4.2 billion.  Convertibles give owners the right to trade their debt for equity after shares rise over a certain price. They allow holders to benefit from a rising share price, while also offering bond-like protection if it falls.  The one challenge of using more convertible debt, however, is \u201cthat it drives more short sellers to your stock. And Musk does not want that,\u201d said Jeffrey Osborne, senior research analyst, Cowen Inc.  Frequently, convertible bond owners will hedge their positions by selling the underlying stock short. Moreover, the dilution caused by conversion could also pressure a stock, drawing the interest of short sellers.  Of the $1.3 billion Tesla has coming due in the next 12 months, $230 million is from a SolarCity convertible due on Nov. 1, and another $920 million from a Tesla convertible due on March 1, 2019. Tesla\u2019s shares, at $319.27, are a long way from the $560.64 needed to convert the SolarCity debt but have traded above the $359.87 March 2019 debt conversion price.  Musk could also choose to offer convertible bond investors the opportunity to exchange their debt for equity below either or both strike prices, although that could require some assurances on the company\u2019s fundamentals.  STRAIGHT DEBT  Tesla could issue straight debt akin to the 5.3 percent coupon junk bond coming due in 2025. That bond however, is trading well below par at 87.13 cents on the dollar, and so it would be unlikely that Tesla could get the sort of favorable terms they secured in their last offering.  Krishna Memani, chief investment officer of OppenheimerFunds, which is among Tesla\u2019s top 10 bondholders, said that the level of scrutiny Musk would have to go through \u201cwould be meaningfully higher in any new issuance.\u201d  EQUITY  Equity markets have historically been friendly to Tesla, however Musk said, on the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call, that he would not tap them for cash. \u201cWe\u2019ll not be raising any equity at any point... I have no expectation of doing so; do not plan to do so.\u201d  The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened an investigation into Musk for potentially misleading investors when he tweeted that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d for a $420 a share take-private deal, according to media reports.  LEASE\/ASSET-BACKED SECURITY DEAL  Tesla could securitize automotive leases backed by drivers\u2019 monthly payments as it did earlier this year when it sold $546 million of bonds backed by leases on Model S and Model X cars.  There are two problems with issuing new asset-backed securities.  The first is that old vehicles may not sell for as much as expected given the increasing competition Tesla is facing in the electric vehicle space. Second, leases as a percentage of vehicles sold have fallen dramatically as it is not possible to lease a Model 3 sedan.

It held the fifth and sixth spots in 2018 and 2017, respectively.  At jobs site Glassdoor, Tesla\u2019s overall company rating fell to 3.2 out of 5.0 stars based on reviews written in the first quarter from a high of 3.6 in 2017, according to historical data compiled by Glassdoor at Reuters\u2019 request. The average rating of the nearly 1 million employers reviewed on the site is 3.4.  In the first quarter, Elon Musk\u2019s CEO approval rating dropped to 52% from 90% in 2017.  Tesla\u2019s \u201crecommend to a friend\u201d rating fell to 49% in the first quarter from a high of 71% two years prior, the Glassdoor data showed.  Similarly, Glassdoor ratings for culture and values, career opportunities, senior leadership and six-month positive business outlook all fell. Only \u201cwork-life balance\u201d and \u201ccompensation and benefits\u201d remained static. No metrics improved.  The reviews are anonymous and Glassdoor says it does not verify identities or employment status.  Told of the rankings, a Tesla spokeswoman said the company remains a highly sought after employer. Tesla received over half a million job applications in 2017 and again in 2018 and expects to exceed that figure in 2019, she said.  Tesla also made Forbes list of \u201cMost Innovative Companies\u201d last year. Employer branding specialist Universum ranked Tesla and sister company SpaceX as the most attractive employers for engineering students.  As Musk prepares to talk up future growth at Tesla\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday, the car maker is weathering a difficult period. Two years after the official launch of its Model 3 sedan, intended to catapult Musk\u2019s company to volume car producer status, Tesla is still struggling to reach its targets.  Tesla lost $700 million in the first quarter and saw a drop in vehicle deliveries, raising concerns about consumer demand and shipping logistics.  Wall Street is also souring on Tesla, with the company\u2019s shares falling 39% so far this year. Analysts have cut their ratings after the company announced lower deliveries and worries over the company\u2019s direction.  Of the two current and 16 former employees who spoke with Reuters since January, some praised Musk as a visionary but said his management style and the exodus of executives have left a void in leadership.  Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer retired in January and the company\u2019s top lawyer left in February after two months on the job. The head of communications is leaving this month. Those positions have been filled.  Tesla had 48,817 full-time employees at the end of 2018, according to SEC filings, after a 9% headcount reduction throughout the company announced in June 2018. Tesla announced it would lay off another 7% of its workforce in January.  In a company-wide email last month, Musk said all expenses would be reviewed, including by him, adding that current spending could quickly eat up Tesla\u2019s recent capital raise. Tesla declined to comment on whether Musk was signing off on each new hire.  Tesla has 1,100 jobs posted on its website, down from 2,510 in January, according to statistics provided by job-post scraping site Thinknum. Many show vacancies since October.  Tesla said job postings differ from jobs open, as one posting could represent multiple openings.

REUTERS\/Tyrone Siu  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tesla\u2019s big-ideas man is sweating the small stuff. Chief Executive Elon Musk told employees on Tuesday that the $60 billion electric-car maker will cut 9 percent of its staff, in an acknowledgement that it\u2019s hard to change the world while not being sustainably profitable. It\u2019s more of a signal than an actual maneuver, but it matters, particularly to the financial community Musk has at times alienated.  Tesla has never made a profit and isn\u2019t about to start, if analysts are to be believed. Those polled by Eikon on average think the company will have positive earnings in the third quarter of next year. Paring the workforce back to 37,000, near where it stood in December, won\u2019t tip the balance. Consensus estimates have the company making a pre-tax loss of $1.5 billion in the current calendar year. Even if it managed to halve its total sales and administration outlays, estimated at $2.9 billion, it would still lose money.  The way Tesla would grow into its heady valuation \u2013 nearly 40 times estimated earnings for 2020 \u2013 is by driving up its top line, rather than cutting its office costs. If the company can produce enough cars, at a high enough margin, its operating expenses will dwindle in proportion to gross profit. The big variable is how many of its Model 3 vehicles Tesla can kick out. Its current run rate is 3,500 a week, and Musk is aiming for 5,000 and then 10,000 a week in time. The new round of job cuts won\u2019t touch the factory floor.  Pink slips don\u2019t build cars, and sacking staff is never a happy affair. But it may help restore confidence among Tesla\u2019s doubters. Musk is more interested in the long-term vision than this year\u2019s profit, and didn\u2019t endear himself to analysts when he lashed out at \u201cbonehead\u201d questions during the company\u2019s first-quarter earnings conference call. That said, he has conceded that Tesla needs to be profitable, and pledged to comb through the company\u2019s costs.  An investment in Tesla is mostly a bet that Musk can keep to his word on the big picture. But especially for those concerned about his high rate of cash consumption, trimming costs moves the needle in his favor.","824":"SAN FRANCISCO\/BENGALURU, India (Reuters) - Tesla Inc deliveries fell 31 percent in its first quarter as the electric car maker struggled with its first shipments of the Model 3 sedan to Europe and China due to longer transit times.  FILE PHOTO: A Tesla car is seen in Santa Monica, California, United States, October 23, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  But the Silicon Valley carmaker reaffirmed its guidance to deliver between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles this year, and said U.S. orders for its new Model 3 - which was recently made available for $35,000 - outpaced what the company was able to fulfill in the quarter.  Tesla, whose delivery numbers missed analysts\u2019 expectations, said it had only delivered half of the quarter\u2019s numbers by March 21, with 10,600 vehicles still in transit at the end of the quarter. By comparison, only 1,900 vehicles were in transit at the end of the fourth quarter.  \u201cOverall, the Street was expecting an apocalyptic quarter and Model 3 deliveries were better than feared by many,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, who noted the overall number was \u201cclearly rocky.\u201d  Lower deliveries in the first quarter had been expected, as Tesla shifted for the first time to delivering its new Model 3 to China and Europe in January and February, amid a slowdown in demand in North America and after a $7,500 tax credit was cut in half at the end of 2018.  On Wednesday, Tesla said net income in the quarter would be negatively impacted by the lower delivery and recent price cuts. The company warned in February that it would post a first-quarter loss.  Tesla delivered 50,900 Model 3s in the quarter, falling short of analysts\u2019 estimates of 58,900, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Tesla delivered a total of 63,000 vehicles, including 12,100 Model S sedans and Model X SUVs. That was less than half the 27,550 Model S and Xs delivered in the fourth quarter.  Analyst Ives called S and X numbers poor, with Tesla focused on Model 3.  Total production fell 10.92 percent to 77,100 vehicles from 86,555 vehicles in fourth quarter. The company churned out 62,950 Model 3s, up from a total of 61,394 Model 3s in the fourth quarter.  The Model 3 is the linchpin of Tesla\u2019s growth strategy and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk is under pressure to deliver the vehicle to new international markets efficiently, while guarding working capital.  Musk has been engaged in a public battle with U.S. regulators stemming from his tweets about Tesla\u2019s production estimates and a judge will hear the case on Thursday.  Although Tesla said in late February that it would soon begin selling its originally promised $35,000 version of its Model 3 sedan to its North American customers, the change came too late to make a marked difference in its quarterly deliveries.  NEW CHALLENGES  Delivering its Model 3 to international markets posed new challenges for Tesla. Musk tweeted that the company encountered \u201cmany unexpected challenges\u201d when Model 3s came through the Belgian port of Zeebrugge in early February. More recently, misprinted labels delayed Model 3s entering through Shanghai.  The arrival of the Model 3 in Norway led to a surge in market share for Tesla in that country, with the car the biggest seller in Norway in March.  Still, some analysts have questioned the sustainability of global demand as European rivals roll out competing electric vehicles.  Too many vehicles in transit can put a strain on Tesla\u2019s working capital. Before Tesla\u2019s release, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimated that working capital could be tapped by as much as $800 million in the quarter due to such vehicles.  Tesla said it ended the quarter with \u201csufficient cash on hand.\u201d  As the company strives to improve margins and post profit later in 2019, the company has laid off workers, including about half of the team hired to deliver cars in the United States, and said it would close stores to lower costs. It has since said it would keep higher-volume stores open, while announcing a 3 percent price increase on some models.  Shares of Tesla closed up 2 percent on Wednesday to $291.81, before the announcement.","825":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc's TSLA.O settlement with U.S. regulators will help soothe investors calling for more oversight of Chief Executive Elon Musk, experts said, even as it gives ammunition to short-sellers pursing separate cases and to a probe by the Justice Department.  FILE PHOTO: A Tesla logo adorns a 'Model S' car in the dealership in Berlin, Germany, November 18, 2015. REUTERS\/Hannibal Hanschke\/File Photo  Musk and Tesla will pay $20 million each, bring in two independent directors and have the billionaire step down as board chairman to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that Musk misled investors by tweeting he had financing for a go-private deal.  That settlement must still be approved by a court, and does not end the Justice Department probe disclosed by Tesla into Musk\u2019s tweets or lawsuits by short-sellers and other investors alleging losses and securities law violations.  \u201cThe real worry for the company is not the SEC but private actions that follow a settlement like this,\u201d said Charles M. Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cBy paying that size fine, it bolsters investors\u2019\u201d claims over stock market losses, he said.  Neither Musk nor Tesla admitted or denied the SEC\u2019s findings as part of the settlement. Neither responded to requests for comment.  Musk settled with the SEC after advisers persuaded him the terms were favorable and a lengthy court fight would not be in the best interest of the company, a person familiar with the deal said. Musk had wanted to personally pay the fine for money-losing Tesla but the SEC rejected that proposal, the person said.  Tesla shares plunged around 14 percent on Friday, the day after the SEC charged Musk with misleading investors, and are down 30 percent since his Aug. 7 tweet saying he was considering taking the company private at $420 a share.  Investor claims could result in substantial settlements in cash or equity, Elson said. An equity settlement could end up diluting Musk\u2019s roughly 19 percent stake in Tesla, further reducing his influence on the board.  Still, Tesla shares could stabilize on Monday on investor relief that the penalties were not higher and that the public face of Tesla will remain in the CEO role under added oversight, analysts said.  Tesla is expected to release third-quarter production this week, and investors are watching to see if it hit targets for the Model 3, a high-volume car. Whether Tesla made a profit likely will not be known until it reports financial results for the quarter.  The settlement disclosed by the SEC on Saturday \u201cis a positive outcome for Elon Musk, Tesla and ultimately shareholders,\u201d wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak, who added he expects Tesla shares to recoup some of their losses from last week.  An expanded board and new chairman offers hope \u201ca true check on Elon will emerge and there will be greater accountability\u201d over Musk\u2019s statements and business targets, Spak added.  Tesla and Musk ended up accepting harsher penalties than the SEC originally proposed to settle the claims, according to the person familiar with the deal. The SEC initially was ready to accept a fine of a few million dollars and Musk\u2019s removal as chairman for two years, but raised its demands after Musk balked at that offer, the person said.","826":"NEW YORK\/BOSTON (Reuters) - Several Tesla Inc TSLA.O shareholders have told Reuters they are concerned that the electric car maker will have to pay more to fund its growth if it becomes a private company and loses the ability to sell new shares to stock market investors.  The issue has come to the fore as a special Tesla board committee considers Chief Executive Elon Musk\u2019s idea of taking the loss-making company private in a deal that could be worth as much as $72 billion.  Tesla, whose bonds are rated \u201cjunk\u201d by credit rating agencies due to its $11 billion debt pile and its negative cash flow, has tapped the stock market six times in the last eight years through share sales, raising nearly $4.3 billion, according to data from Dealogic.  Without that ready access to capital, Tesla investors who would consider keeping their stake in a private Tesla - as Musk has suggested - wonder how Tesla would fund itself as a private company.  \u201cIt ultimately comes down to if you can afford to be private and if you can get funding, and what the cost of that funding is,\u201d said Craig Birk, chief investment officer for Personal Capital Advisors Corp, a Tesla shareholder which owned about 97,000 shares as of June 30.  Musk shocked investors last week with a tweet that he was considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420 a share and that funding was \u201csecured.\u201d  He elaborated on Monday that he believed Saudi Arabia\u2019s PIF, a new shareholder in Tesla, could provide the necessary funding, although sources close to the sovereign wealth fund have played down that prospect.  The 47-year-old entrepreneur and engineer said this week he believes two-thirds of existing Tesla shareholders would roll over their holdings into a private company, rather than cash out, and that he was still talking with major shareholders and advisers before settling on a structure for a deal. It remains unclear how any deal would be financed.  FILE PHOTO: A Tesla sales and service center is shown in Costa Mesa, California, U.S., June 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  LACK OF LIQUIDITY  Musk has cited his long-running vendetta with short-sellers, who are betting that Tesla\u2019s stock will go down, as well as Wall Street\u2019s short-term focus on quarterly earnings, as reasons to take the company private. The implications for the company\u2019s funding, however, show that exiting the stock market will likely come with costs for Tesla.  Musk said on Monday he did not want to saddle Tesla with more debt, meaning it would then have to rely on private fundraising rounds like Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and other venture-backed companies, likely incurring a much higher cost of capital.  Estimates on how expensive private equity fundraising is compared with secondary share sales in the stock market vary. Venky Ganesan, investing partner at Menlo Ventures, said in an interview that the cost of capital - the rate of return required by an investor to persuade them to make a given investment - averages 17 percent to 18 percent for private companies compared with 6 percent to 7 percent for public companies.  \u201cThe primary downside of going private is the higher cost of capital that investors demand for the lack of liquidity, being able to buy and sell at a fair price at short notice,\u201d Jacobs Thomas, professor of accounting and finance at Yale School of Management, wrote on the university\u2019s website earlier this month in a post on Tesla.  The issue of funding is not merely academic. Tesla burnt through $3.4 billion of cash last year and has said it expects to invest another $2.5 billion this year.  Musk has said repeatedly since April that Tesla has no need to raise new capital. But analysts expect Tesla will require billions of dollars more over the next several years to fund its expansion plans and to develop new electric premium vehicles to take on German rivals.  On top of that, the company\u2019s battery Gigafactory outside Reno, Nevada is still only partially complete, and Musk has said that an announcement about a European plant will likely come by the end of this year.  Another big-ticket item for Tesla is its recently announced China factory in Shanghai, although Musk has said funding for the roughly $2 billion cost would come from local debt.  NEW CARS IN DEVELOPMENT  Getting access to cheap capital is a constant challenge for automakers, which can spend $1 billion or more engineering a single new model and bringing it to mass production, only to have the vehicle flop because of a cyclical sales slump or a shift in market tastes.  Mainstream automakers have historically failed to earn their cost of capital of about 9 percent because investments in new models, new technology and production equipment do not generate sufficient profits, the late Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI chief executive Sergio Marchionne said in an April 2015 investor presentation.  Three new vehicles are in development at Tesla, the Model Y compact SUV, a new $200,000 Roadster and an electric heavy-duty truck that Musk unveiled last November, with production start dates in 2019 and 2020.  Analysts say that a lot will depend on the forecasts that investors make on the company\u2019s profitability for the next few years. The quicker Tesla can turn a sizeable profit, the easier it will be able to fund itself.  \u201cTesla is clearly capital-intensive... but it\u2019s also a disruptor that\u2019s growing like crazy, perhaps making it more akin to high-growth tech companies,\u201d Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a research note on Thursday.","827":"(Reuters) - Shares of Tesla ended sharply lower in their S&P 500 debut Monday, with losses accelerating after news of potential future competition from Apple.  Tesla ended down 6.5% from a record high in the previous session, its steepest one-day drop in over a week. Losses steepened towards the end of the session after Reuters reported that Apple is targeting 2024 to produce a passenger vehicle that could include its own breakthrough battery technology.  The company\u2019s shares had opened down nearly 5%.  The decline in Tesla\u2019s shares accounted for about 0.1 percentage points of the S&P 500\u2019s 0.4% decline for the day, according to Refinitiv data.  The electric car maker, headed by billionaire Elon Musk, is the most valuable company ever admitted to Wall Street's main benchmark and accounted for a 1.69% weight in the index ahead of Monday's trading. The shares had surged almost 60% since mid-November, when Tesla's debut in the S&P 500 was announced here, and have soared almost 700% so far in 2020.  Tesla jumped 6% on Friday in frantic trading ahead of its S&P 500 entry.  GRAPHIC: Tesla joins the S&P 500 -  Tesla\u2019s addition to the S&P 500 led index-tracking funds to buy $90 billion of shares by the end of Friday so their portfolios reflected the index, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices\u2019 analyst Howard Silverblatt. The change was effective prior to the open of trading on Monday, and Tesla is replacing Apartment Investment and Management Co.  Actively managed funds that benchmark their performance to the S&P 500 must now decide whether to buy shares of Tesla, and risk underperforming if Tesla\u2019s recent rally continues and they do not own the shares.  \u201cWe put off that decision because we really believe the stock was running up into its inclusion in the S&P and that those who are in it for the arbitrage would sell starting today, and at least today, we are right,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.  California-based Tesla\u2019s rally has put its market value at about $616 billion, making it the sixth most valuable publicly listed U.S. company, although many investors view it as wildly overvalued.  Silverblatt said the S&P 500\u2019s 2021 price\/earnings ratio rises to 22.6 from 22.3 following Tesla\u2019s addition.  Tesla is by far the most traded stock by value on Wall Street, with $18 billion worth of its shares exchanged on average in each session over the past 12 months, easily beating Apple, in second place with average daily trades of $14 billion, according to Refinitiv.  About a fifth of Tesla\u2019s shares are closely held by Musk, the chief executive, and other insiders.","828":"April 4 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc\u2019s $1.8 billion junk bond price fell by the most in seven months and the cost to insure its debt against default surged on Thursday after a bigger-than-expected drop in first-quarter deliveries.

Clark\u2019s attorney, David Weisbrod, did not immediately return a call seeking comment.  A 19-year-old British man and a 22-year-old man in Orlando, Florida, have also been charged under U.S. federal law with aiding the attack, the Justice Department said.  Clark netted at least $100,000 from the scheme by using the celebrity accounts to solicit investments from unsuspecting Twitter users, state officials said.  Mason Sheppard, a 19-year-old from Bognor Regis, Britain, who used the alias Chaewon, was charged with wire fraud and money laundering while Orlando-based Nima Fazeli, 22, nicknamed Rolex, was accused of aiding and abetting the crimes, according to a Justice Department statement.  In the hack, fraudulent tweets soliciting investments in the digital currency bitcoin were posted in mid-July by 45 verified Twitter accounts, including those belonging to Biden, former President Barack Obama and billionaire Bill Gates.

Call options, which convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future, were particularly busy and logged significant price gains on the day.  One block of 714 Tesla call options, betting on the shares rising above $365 by the end of the week, were bought for 85 cents, for a total outlay of $60,690. Just hours later they were worth $1.3 million on paper.  Other near-dated bullish contracts also registered sharp gains.

Short-sellers, who had been saddled with sharp losses earlier this month after Tesla shares soared following quarterly results, suffered paper losses of about $1.3 billion and were now $3.03 billion in the red for the year, according to S3.  \u201cTesla\u2019s volatility makes it more of a trading stock than a value play,\u201d said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 in New York.  \u201cBoth longs and shorts are susceptible to wild price moves which can easily swing a trader\u2019s book from profit to loss in a single day, which may be the reason they are in the name in the first place,\u201d he said.  If the share price rises to the buyout price of $420 and the number of shares sold short does not change, year-to-date paper losses could swell to $4.45 billion, according to S3.  That could lead to a short squeeze - where bearish traders are forced to buy shares to avoid big losses, pushing the stock higher - Dusaniwsky said.

The logo of the German car manufacturer Audi is pictured at the training center during a media tour in San Jose Chilapa, Mexico April 19, 2018. REUTERS\/Henry Romero  Audi\u2019s image has been tarnished by regulatory probes investigating what role its engineers may have played in designing engine management software to cheat modern emissions tests.  Audi will launch more than 20 electrified vehicles by 2025 thanks to an ability for using parent Volkswagen's VOWG_p.DE new MEB modular platform and vehicle underpinnings jointly developed with premium sibling Porsche, it said.  That\u2019s slightly more ambitious than the 20 electrified vehicles Audi had previously guided for. Audi said it would launch the cars without undermining its 8-10 percent operating margin target.  Audi declined to provide details about how many fully battery electric, and how many hybrid cars it will sell by 2025. Last year, it sold about 16,000 semi-electric vehicles and it still lacks a fully electric model in its lineup.  The Ingolstadt, Germany-based brand, which delivered 1.88 million cars globally in 2017 currently offers three plug-in hybrid vehicles.  In August, Audi will launch the e-tron sport utility vehicle, its first serial all-electric model.

REUTERS\/Wolfgang Rattay  The fortunes of battery makers in South Korea, Japan and China are linked to Tesla, the EV market leader, as they supply its factories in Nevada and Shanghai.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday the carmaker aims to lower electric vehicle prices to $25,000 each by producing new batteries with cheaper costs and longer range.  Musk said that it will take about three years to fully achieve this goal-- disappointing investors and wiping $50 billion off its market value -- but analysts said plans for in house production would put pressure on suppliers to lower prices.  \u201cTesla will have more power in negotiating prices and therefore overall battery costs will fall further,\u201d said Rho Woo-ho, an analyst at Meritz Securities.  Shares in South Korea's LG Chem 051910.KS finished 1.4% lower after falling as much as 5.5% while Panasonic 6752.T ended down 3.7% and China's CATL 300750.SZ was down 1.7%.  A Panasonic spokeswoman said the company is \u201cconsidering a variety of options\u201d when asked if Panasonic would partner with Tesla on new cell production, but added that nothing has been determined at this time.  \u201cWe value our relationship with Tesla and look forward to enhancing our partnership,\u201d the company said.  LG Chem declined to comment. A source familiar with the company said it is open to cooperating with Tesla on the new batteries.  CATL said in a statement it also planned research and investment in nickel rich chemistry, large cells and integrated structure, which are part of Tesla\u2019s technology development roadmap, and saw them as key factors in making electric vehicles mainstream.  \u2018INSANELY DIFFICULT\u2019  Tesla said it plans to achieve 100 gigawatt hours of internal battery capacity in 2022 and 3,000 gigawatt hours by 2030 -- roughly 85 times greater than the capacity of its Nevada plant by 2030.  \u201cThis 100 gigawatt hours are supplemental to what we buy from suppliers,\u201d Musk said, reiterating that Tesla will continue to use its existing cell suppliers.  Tesla currently produces batteries in partnership with Panasonic at its Nevada factory, while LG Chem and CATL supply cells to its Shanghai factory.  Tesla said it has started ramping up production of its new batteries at a pilot line near its vehicle plant in Fremont, California, but the production yield is not high.  \u201cIt is insanely difficult to scale up,\u201d Musk said at the company\u2019s closely watched \u201cBattery Day\u201d presentation. \u201cThere is a clear path to success but a ton of work to do,\u201d he said.

The end result? They decided not to invest in any.  \u201cThere are too many uncertainties from when a company tells a story in the early stage, to when it produces a sample car and raises funds, to the eventual mass production,\u201d said Wei, managing director at Shanghai-based Sailing Capital.  Wei, who declined to name the EV makers his team visited, said he thinks only a few of them will survive. Sailing instead decided to invest in an EV parts supplier, he added.  His concerns reflect what bankers describe as increasingly tough funding times for Chinese EV makers which must jostle for attention in a crowded sector and produce convincing arguments about future profitability despite government cuts to EV subsidies and plans to phase them out.  Numerous setbacks plaguing Tesla Inc in its quest for sustained profitability as well as a dramatic slide in sales and problems with some cars at Chinese startup Nio Inc have also put investors on their guard.  This year, Chinese EV makers have raised just $783.1 million as of mid-June compared with $6 billion for the same period a year earlier and $7.7 billion for all of 2018, according to data provider PitchBook.  One Hong Kong-based banker said he had been approached by at least a dozen EV makers seeking new funds but had to pass on most of them as they were not able to set themselves apart from the crowd.  Even fundraising efforts that have gotten off the ground are not moving as fast as EV makers would like.  \u201cIt is challenging,\u201d said the banker who began working on one fundraising this year. \u201cIf you can get a meeting with investors, you can always tell a story, but some don\u2019t even reply to your requests for a meeting.\u201d  He declined to be identified as the negotiations were not public.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  SUBSIDY WOES  Eager to curb smog and jump-start its own auto industry, China has said it wants so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs) - which also include hybrids, plug-in hybrids and fuel cell cars - to account for a fifth of auto sales by 2025 compared with 5% now.  Those ambitions have spawned a plethora of EV startups competing not just with each other, but also global automakers and Tesla, which plans to start production in China this year.  About 330 EV firms are registered for some sort of subsidy, government data shows, although the number of more well established startups is much smaller, at around 50.  But amid criticism that some firms have become overly reliant on government funds, Beijing has reduced subsidies, raised the standards needed for vehicles to qualify and flagged they will end altogether after 2020.  That has led to sharp slowdown as vehicle prices rise. Sales of NEVs in May rose just 1.8% from a year earlier compared with 18.1% in April, and 62% growth for 2018.  Surviving in the current funding environment, requires much cost discipline, Daniel Kirchert, CEO at Nanjing-based EV maker Byton, told Reuters.  \u201cGiven the current situation, it is not enough for any startup to come up with good products and be fast to market. At least it\u2019s equally important to manage cost. Not only fixed costs but variable cost,\u201d he said.  Byton, which is backed by state-owned automaker FAW Group and battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co (CATL) is one of a few EV makers with a fundraising round in train, seeking $500 million.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Others include Leap Motor, backed by state-owned Shanghai Electric Group Corp and Sequoia Capital China, which is seeking $372 million as well as CHJ Automotive, founded by serial entrepreneur Li Xiang, which wants to raise as much as $500 million.  Those with successful funding under their belts this year include Baidu Inc-backed WM Motor Technology Co Ltd which closed a $446 million round in March, according to PitchBook.  Some have obtained money outside private equity. E-Town Capital, a Beijing government investment firm, will invest 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) in a joint venture with Nio, which could help Nio build its own plant.  TESLA, NIO WEIGH  But overall, industry funding prospects are much bleaker, particularly as Tesla and Nio struggle.  Founder Elon Musk told Tesla employees last month the $2.7 billion the company recently raised would give it just 10 months to break even at the rate it burned cash in the first quarter. Shares in the industry pioneer have slid 32% in the year to date.  Nio\u2019s shares have been hit harder, down 60% this year on a cut to its delivery outlook, a halving in first-quarter sales from the previous quarter, increased competition and reduced subsidies. Its reputation has also been hurt after three vehicles caught on fire and by the inadvertent shutting down of a car on Beijing\u2019s prestigious Changan Avenue after the driver initiated a software update.  Nio declined to comment.  \u201cSome of the listed EV industry leaders are currently underperforming in the secondary trading market and that has created pressures for the sector\u2019s short-term outlook,\u201d said Brian Gu, president of EV startup Xpeng Motors and a former senior JP Morgan banker.  \u201cWe are seeing investors become more cautious, selective and keenly focused on the frontrunners. I think this trend is likely to persist,\u201d he said.  An investor in WM Motor was more downbeat about the willingness of private equity investors to fund the industry.  \u201cNio is probably the best among Chinese EV start-ups. Look where it stands now - how can that make us comfortable about writing cheques for other EV start-ups?\u201d said the investor who also held Nio shares but sold them this year.","846":"Nov 17 (Reuters) - Shares of Tesla Inc rose 11% before the bell on Tuesday, adding around $40 billion to the value of the electric carmaker and giving another boost to the fortune of billionaire Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk.  S&P Dow Jones Indices confirmed after markets closed on Monday that they would add the company to Wall Street\u2019s main index from Dec. 21, firing the starting gun on a major reorganization of investment funds that track the basket of stocks.  At $400 billion, Tesla\u2019s market capitalization is a hundred times that of the S&P\u2019s smaller companies, according to Refinitiv data, and potentially making it the biggest ever addition to the index.  S&P DJI said the addition of the car company would require investment funds indexed to the S&P 500 to sell about $51 billion worth of shares of current member companies so that their portfolios correctly reflect the index.  \u201cPotentially one of the pushbacks on adding Tesla to the S&P was the elevated stock price,\u201d Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy wrote in a note. \u201cThe stock\u2019s recent pullback provides better opportunity for index trackers to build positions.\u201d  Bolstered by a decade of stock market gains, the combined market capitalization of the S&P 500 now totals close to $32 trillion, and S&P DJI data at the start of this year showed investments indexed to it reached $4.6 trillion.  If the pre-market gains hold, Tesla\u2019s own value will top $440 billion, more than the S&P gained on Monday after news emerged of successful COVID-19 vaccine trial data from Moderna Inc.  The run in to Tesla\u2019s addition next month may see more speculative buying.  In 1999, Yahoo surged 64% in five trading days between the announcement that it would be added to the index and its inclusion. Yahoo\u2019s market capitalization at the time was only $56 billion.  \u201cThe 12% move is probably a short squeeze more than anything else,\u201d said Mark Taylor, sales trader at Mirabaud Securities, London.  \u201cI believe in letting the dust settle for a few days and see how things pan out in terms of how much tracker money has gone behind this.\u201d (Reporting by Subrat Patnaik, Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru and Noel Randewich in San Francisco; editing by Patrick Graham)","847":"Jan 15 (Reuters) - Tesla challenger Nio Inc said on Wednesday it was exploring financing and strategic opportunities with Guangzhou Automobile Group, but the talks are in preliminary stage.

REUTERS\/Aly Song  The people declined to be named as the plan has not been made public. They did not offer detail on the price change.  China allowed the yuan to weaken past the 7-per-dollar level on Monday for the first time in more than a decade, after which the U.S. government labeled China a currency manipulator, raising the stakes in the trade dispute between the two countries.  China firmly opposes the currency manipulator label saying it has not used and will not use the yuan to cope with the U.S. trade frictions.  The sharp drop in the yuan comes days after U.S. President Donald Trump stunned financial markets by vowing to impose 10% tariffs on the remaining $300 billion of Chinese imports from Sept. 1, abruptly breaking a brief ceasefire in a trade war that has disrupted global supply chains and slowed growth.  Tesla currently imports all the cars it sells in China, but it is in the process of building a factory in Shanghai that will manufacture Model 3 cars in the initial phase and help it minimize the impact of the trade war and tariffs.  If enacted, this would be the first case of a planned price adjustment by an importer since the yuan fell this week and points to the growing pressure that importers are facing.  Tesla broke ground on the Shanghai factory in January and its Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has said the firm aims to finish initial construction this summer and start production of the Model 3 toward the end of the year.  Deliveries of all models in the second quarter this year rose 51% from the first quarter to 95,200 vehicles, including 77,550 Model 3s, 17,650 Model S and X.  Last month, Tesla globally dropped the standard-range variants of its Model X and Model S from its product lineup and adjusted prices across its range.  In China, the world\u2019s largest electric vehicle market, the trade frictions between China and the U.S. has caused Tesla to adjust its multiple times over the past year because of the tariff changes.  Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters\u2019 request for comment.","850":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla Inc has asked the Trump administration to exempt the Chinese-made car computer \u201cbrain\u201d of its new Model 3 sedan from 25 percent tariffs imposed in August, saying they threaten the electric carmaker\u2019s bottom line.

Led by tech billionaire Elon Musk, Tesla is among a host of companies, including No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co, to warn of growing costs related to the tariff war between the world\u2019s two largest economies.  The Chinese-made computer, used by Tesla in the car assembled in Fremont, California, was among $16 billion in imports that were hit with 25 percent tariffs by the United States Trade Representative\u2019s Office in 2018.  In a redacted request posted on a government website by the USTR on Dec. 17, Tesla did not identify the supplier of the computer. But it said it had been unable to find another manufacturer \u201cwith the required specifications, at the volume requested and under the timelines necessary for Tesla\u2019s continued growth.\u201d  Tesla, which called the Model 3\u2019s computer \u201cthe brain of the vehicle,\u201d added that \u201cchoosing any other supplier would have delayed the (Model 3) program by 18 months with clean room setup, line validation, and staff training.\u201d  Using a new supplier \u201csubstantially increases the risk of poor part quality that could lead overall vehicle quality issues that would impact the safety of our vehicles and the consumer acceptance of the final product,\u201d Tesla added in its request for tariff relief.  Tesla declined to comment on the tariff matter on Friday. But it has been aggressively cutting costs as it works to meet production goals for the Model 3, which has become a top-selling luxury sedan on the U.S. market alongside the larger Model S.  Other automakers have sought similar exemptions but have not yet received an answer.  GM in late July sought an exemption to a 25 percent U.S. tariff on its Chinese-made Buick Envision sport utility vehicle. The Envision accounted for nearly 15 percent of U.S. Buick sales last year, even as sales fell by 27 percent.  In October, GM also sought exclusions for about two dozen parts, including push button ignition switches and transmission bearings. Nissan Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV have also filed exclusion requests for parts, while Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] asked for an exclusion for electric bikes rented through the Uber app.  The Trump administration has imposed 25 percent tariffs on a total of $50 billion in annual Chinese exports and 10 percent tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese exports. The tariffs were in response to what the Trump administration calls China\u2019s unfair trade practices.","851":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O announced record quarterly car production on Tuesday but warned of major problems with selling cars in China due to new tariffs that would force it to accelerate investment in its factory in Shanghai.  In July, China raised tariffs on imports of U.S. autos to 40 percent amid a worsening trade war with the United States. Tesla said the combination of tariffs and transportation costs was hurting Tesla sales in the world\u2019s biggest electric car market, sending shares down 2 percent to $304.37.  \u201cTaking ocean transport costs and import tariffs into account, Tesla is now operating at a 55 percent to 60 percent cost disadvantage compared to the exact same car locally produced in China,\u201d the company said.  The California-based electric carmaker, emerging from several months of turmoil stemming from its tweeting Chief Executive Elon Musk, said it produced 80,142 vehicles in the third quarter, a 50 percent jump from its prior quarter as the company strives to master volume production.  Tesla has scrambled to get the Model 3 into the hands of customers, many of whom have been waiting since early 2016. Vehicles have piled up in lots around California awaiting transport, and Musk said last month that Tesla had moved from \u201cproduction hell to delivery logistics hell.\u201d  Tesla delivered 83,500 cars, including 55,840 Model 3 sedans, which topped Wall Street forecasts.  As the quarter drew to a close on Sept. 30, Musk invited Tesla owners to volunteer at delivery centers to help new owners picking up their Model 3s, answering questions and giving vehicle overviews.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam\/File Photo  Tesla reduced the number of Model 3s in transit to customers to 15 percent of total Model 3s delivered from 60 percent in the second quarter, a figure watched by analysts as an indicator of future revenue and of Tesla\u2019s efficiency.  But the company in its release did not reiterate Musk\u2019s oft-repeated promise that Tesla would be profitable and cash flow positive in both its third and fourth quarters. Tesla is expected to release quarterly financial results next month.  Musk wrote in an email to employees on Saturday the company was \u201cvery close to achieving profitability\u201d but for that it must stabilize a brutal ramp-up in output whose targets it has consistently struggled to meet.  Tesla has been burning cash and holding out the promise that churning out Model 3s at volume and a profit could ease its crunch. The figures announced on Tuesday did not specify profit margins for the new car, although Tesla sold mostly higher-priced variants.  \u201cBottom line is cash is tight,\u201d wrote Gene Munster, head of research at brokerage Loup Ventures, who estimated that Tesla needs $1.5 billion to sustain operations. It ended the second quarter with about $2.3 billion. \u201cThis is a step in the right direction, but more work remains.\u201d  Tesla also is recovering from a fight with U.S. securities regulators over whether Musk misled investors when he tweeted in August that he was considering taking the company private and had secured funding.  Tesla and Musk reached a settlement on Saturday where the billionaire will step down as the company\u2019s chairman but remain as chief executive.  On average, Tesla produced about 4,000 Model 3s per week during the quarter. It first hit a goal of building 5,000 vehicles in a week at the end of June, and had hoped to reach a new target of making 6,000 Model 3s per week by the end of August.  CHINA PLANS  Amid the worsening of President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China, Tesla said it was speeding up construction of its Shanghai Gigafactory but provided no details.  Musk in July landed a deal with Chinese authorities to build a new combined auto and battery plant in Shanghai, its first outside the United States and a key to doubling its global capacity. Local debt, he said, would finance the factory, which Tesla estimated would cost about $2 billion.  Tigress Research analyst Ivan Feinseth said Musk \u201ccontinues to downplay\u201d the need for cash to fund projects beyond the China plant.  \u201cI believe he will need to raise additional money even if he is profitable for this quarter as he as projected,\u201d said Feinseth, citing the cost of the upcoming electric semi-truck and the Model Y SUV.","852":"Aug 27 (Reuters) - A federal judge in San Francisco has dismissed a lawsuit in which Tesla Inc shareholders accused the carmaker of misleading the public about the progress on production of its Model 3 vehicle.

Tesla shares rose as much as 5.5 percent to $273.88 before easing to $271.63 in early-afternoon trade on Nasdaq. Despite the gains, the stock is still down more than 20 percent since Aug. 6, the day before Musk said on Twitter he would take the company private and claimed he had secured funding to do so.  Judge Alison Nathan of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York approved a motion filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission outlining the agreement with Tesla and Musk.  A Tesla spokesperson confirmed the settlement, but said the automaker would make no further comment on the matter.  Under an agreement with the SEC, Musk has agreed to pay a $20 million fine and step aside as Tesla\u2019s chairman for three years to settle charges that could have forced his exit from Tesla.  The company will also pay a $20 million fine, despite not being charged with fraud.  The government lawsuit threatened Tesla and Musk with a long fight that could have undermined its operations and ability to raise capital.

Musk has gained legions of fans for his bold approach to business and technology, using his 23 million Twitter followers to promote Tesla, his rocket company SpaceX, and tunnel venture Boring Co.  But the Aug. 7 claim that he had the funding to take Tesla private, and a subsequent U-turn, stunned Wall Street and came as Musk was filmed briefly smoking marijuana during a live Web show and when he called a British diver in the Thai cave rescue a \u201cpedo.\u201d  The Financial Times reported last week that outgoing Twenty-First Century Fox Inc CEO James Murdoch, a son of Fox mogul Rupert Murdoch, was the lead candidate to replace Musk as chairman.

Thanks to Musk\u2019s vision and showmanship, Tesla\u2019s valuation has at times eclipsed that of traditional, established U.S. automakers that make millions of vehicles and billions of dollars in profits annually, and the company has garnered legions of fans despite repeated production issues.","856":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Wednesday reported a 36 percent slide in solar installations and said it had implemented a new selling strategy months after ending a partnership to sell the rooftop systems in busy Home Depot stores.

Chief Executive Elon Musk said the compact SUV, built on the same platform as the Model 3, would first debut in a long-range version with a range of 300 miles (482 km) priced at $47,000.  A standard version, to be available sometime in 2021, would cost $39,000, with a 230-mile range. The vehicles can be configured to include 7 seats for an additional $3,000.  After the event, Tesla\u2019s website included a page to \u201cdesign and order\u201d the more expensive, long range version of the vehicle with rear-wheel drive, available next year. Ordering the car requires a $2,500 refundable deposit.  Musk unveiled the vehicle at a short 40-minute event at Tesla's design studio in Hawthorne, outside Los Angeles, that was streamed live online. (www.tesla.com\/modely).  Each of Tesla\u2019s vehicles, from the Roadster to the latest Semi, were driven onstage before the blue Model Y appeared.  Small SUVs are the fastest-growing segment in the United States and China, the world\u2019s largest auto market, where Tesla is building a factory, making the Model Y well positioned to tap demand.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Tesla has enjoyed little competition thus far for its sedans, but competition for electric SUVs is heating up as Tesla tries to master a new set of economics from the luxury line that made its reputation.

Shares of Tesla are down 24 percent from an August high of $379.57, when Musk tweeted that he was taking Tesla private.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  That plan - later scrapped - ushered in a period of turmoil at the company, from Musk\u2019s public battles with regulators, a flurry of securities lawsuits, cost cutting and layoffs.  Tesla, two weeks ago, said it would close most stores and use savings to cut the price of most cars by 6 percent. But last week, Tesla reversed course and said it would leave many stores open and raised prices back by about 3 percent.  Musk has promised an easier production ramp of the Model Y as it shares about three-quarters of its parts with the Model 3 and would need only half the capital expenditures of the sedan.  The risk is \u201cquite low\u201d Musk told analysts in January. Tesla would \u201cmost likely\u201d build the Model Y at Tesla\u2019s battery factory in Nevada, he said at the time. Musk gave no new details about where the Model Y would be produced at Thursday\u2019s event.  Still, the Model Y, like all Tesla models, has already seen pre-production delays.

The memo, which the paper said was sent by a global supply manager, described the request as essential to Tesla\u2019s continued operation and characterized it as an investment in the car company to continue the long-term growth between both players.

The company has cooperated in responding to what it called a \u201cvoluntary request\u201d for documents from the Department of Justice in September, a Tesla spokesperson said. The agency has the ability to press criminal charges.  \u201cWe have not received a subpoena, a request for testimony, or any other formal process, and there have been no additional document requests about this from the Department of Justice for months,\u201d the spokesperson said in an email.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation is examining whether Tesla misstated information about the production of its Model 3 sedans and misled investors about its business going back to early 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources.  In recent weeks, FBI agents have contacted former Tesla employees to seek testimony in the criminal case, according to the report. The ex-employees received subpoenas earlier in the probe, and FBI agents recently have sought to interview a number of them, the sources said.  Any focus on Tesla\u2019s past statements about Model 3 production targets would broaden the probe by the agency, which Tesla said last month was looking at statements made by Chief Executive Elon Musk about a go-private deal that was later called off.  Tesla first disclosed in September that the DoJ was investigating Musk\u2019s tweets about having \u201cfunding secured\u201d for a deal to take Tesla private, saying the agency had asked for documents about such statements.

The company on Wednesday posted a profit and positive cash flow, making good on pledges made by Musk earlier this year, as the company ramps up volume of its new sedan.  MODEL 3 CHALLENGES  Tesla and Musk already face a proposed class action shareholder lawsuit claiming that the company and its top executives made false statements about the readiness of the Model 3 for volume production.  The car, which the money-losing company is banking on to turn a profit, was introduced to the public in early 2016 to great fanfare, with repeated promises throughout 2017 that Tesla was \u201con track\u201d to build 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of that year at its factory in Fremont, California.  Such statements were fraudulent, according to the lawsuit, given that the automated assembly lines to build the car in such volume were behind schedule.  Tesla has denied the claims in the lawsuit, saying it disclosed production bottlenecks once they were identified, and citing Musk\u2019s public statements that the company was undergoing a period of \u201cproduction hell\u201d in 2017.  Tesla only reached a goal to build 5,000 Model 3s per week in June, although current production has fallen short of that.  Musk and Tesla only recently settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over Musk\u2019s Aug. 7 tweets. The SEC sued him for fraud, calling his claims \u201cfalse and misleading,\u201d before reaching a settlement.  Both Tesla and Musk must pay a $20 million fine, and Musk must give up his chairman role for three years as the company appoints an independent chair.

A look at Tesla's cash position","878":"NEW YORK, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Elon Musk\u2019s suggestion on Tuesday that he would like to take Tesla Inc private may provide something the electric car maker needs: a little debt relief.  The 11 percent jump in Tesla\u2019s stock price following Musk\u2019s public musings on possibly buying the company from existing shareholders drove $2.3 billion of convertible debt past the level at which investors can swap them for stock at a profit.  Tesla shares ended the day at $379.57, within reach of their all-time high and more than 5 percent above the bonds\u2019 conversion price of $359.8676.  \u201cThis is great news for any bondholder any way you spin it,\u201d said Ross Gerber, chief executive of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management who owns both the convertibles and the stock.  \u201cMost of these bonds are convertible notes, so we can choose to convert into stock at a huge profit,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a boon for any bondholder at Tesla, because most of the bonds are convertible notes.\u201d  Convertibles give bondholders the right to trade their debt for equity after shares rise over a certain set price.  The $2.3 billion in debt that investors can now take in equity rather than cash removes pressure from the cash-strapped company which has about $9.5 billion in long-term debt, according to its latest financial statements.  After first issuing a tweet that he was mulling the idea of taking Tesla private, Musk on Tuesday said in a letter to employees that he would prefer to run Tesla as a private company to allow it to operate away from the attention it receives due to its notoriously volatile stock price.  While no final decision has been made, he suggested a buyout price of $420 per share.  Investors like billionaire George Soros now have the option to take advantage of Tesla\u2019s recovering share price, as the company\u2019s $920 million convertible bond due in March 2019 passed its $359.8676 conversion rate.  Soros Fund Management LLC took a $35 million stake in the 2019 Tesla convertible bonds in May of 2018.  The company\u2019s $1.38 billion convertible bond due in March 2021 also passed the same conversion rate.  The convertibles have oscillated between being in and out of the money several times over the last year.  They first rose above the conversion price in June 2017 and Tesla\u2019s stock price hit a record high of $389.61 in September last year. The stock then plunged to as low as $244.59 in April as the company struggled to meet production targets for its Model 3 sedan and Moody\u2019s Investors Service cut Tesla\u2019s credit rating deep into junk-bond territory.  Tesla on Aug. 1 reported that it had ended the second quarter with $2.78 billion in cash after spending $610 million in capital expenses, while its negative free cash flow narrowed.  Tesla has been burning through cash as manufacturing problems have thwarted its ability to meet production targets for its Model 3 sedan.  The company also has a $1.8 billion high-yield bonds, which rose to 92 cents on the dollar on Tuesday, up half a cent and the highest since mid-June.

Chief Executive Elon Musk said in tweets at the weekend that Tesla would focus initially on delivering the fully-loaded Model 3s, which come with a full range of bells and whistles but not its vaunted autopilot feature.  \u201cCost of all options, wheels, paint, etc is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15 percent quicker & with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track,\u201d Musk tweeted.  A BMW M3 starts at $66,500 while Tesla\u2019s own Model S starts at $74,500.  Analysts say Tesla\u2019s future growth hinges on the success of the Model 3, its most affordable vehicle to date at a base price of $35,000. The company has so far struggled to ramp up production and failed to reach a series of weekly production targets.  Musk, whose refusal to answer questions from some analysts in a call earlier this month prompted a fall in shares, said that Tesla had to focus on delivering higher-priced Model 3s first, or it would \u201cdie\u201d.  The company, which is undergoing a \u201cthorough reorganization\u201d to contend with production problems, senior staff departures and recent crashes involving its electric cars, is striving to reach a production rate of 5,000 cars per week.  \u201cWith production, 1st you need achieve target rate & then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money & die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k\/wk to ship $35k Tesla & live,\u201d Musk said.  On Friday, proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) backed a shareholder proposal to separate Musk\u2019s current chairman and CEO roles, suggesting that shareholders would be better served by having Musk focus on running the company. .  The recommendation by ISS echoed one made earlier last week by rival proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Tesla is seen at a branch office in Bern, Switzerland March 25, 2020. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  Musk's Tesla TSLA.O has recently acquired a licence that will enable the carmaker to trade electricity across western Europe and the company has also been surveying customers in Germany about potentially using Tesla electricity in their cars.  Such moves, consultants and energy industry executives say, could set the stage for the company - possibly with one or more partners - to take on established utilities in Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest power market and autos heartland.  Tesla declined to comment about its energy market plans.  Generating and trading power could help Tesla lower the running costs of its cars at a time rival automakers, including Germany's BMW BMWG.DE, Audi NSUG.DE, Porsche [PSCH.UL] and Mercedes DAIGn.DE, are churning out new electric models.  It could also step up competition to utilities such as Vattenfall [VATN.UL] and EnBW EBKG.DE, which are investing in electric mobility services too, but which like peers RWE RWEG.DE and E.ON EONGn.DE are lumbered with the cost of winding down fossil fuel and nuclear power plants.  Tesla already sells solar panels and the Powerwall battery storage system for homes, but now appears to be looking at selling electricity directly to customers and using the home storage systems to provide services to the grid.  In June, the company became a member of the Paris-based EPEX Spot power exchange, a platform used to trade much of western Europe\u2019s intraday cross-border electricity.  A month later, it surveyed German customers about their interest in energy services.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cWhat would encourage you to switch from your existing energy supplier?\u201d, the survey said, according to a copy seen by Reuters.  \u201cWould you buy a Tesla photovoltaic system and home storage (Tesla Powerwall) if you could switch to a specially designed Tesla electricity tariff?\u201d, it added.  Tesla also asked potential energy customers whether they would allow the company to control when cars would charge.  This could allow it to coincide charging with cheap electricity rates during off peak hours, consultants and industry executives said.  It could also open the way for Tesla to use power stored by customers to help balance the electricity grid, an increasingly important service in Germany as it becomes ever more dependent on volatile wind and solar power.  Companies offering similar services in Germany include Shell-owned RDSa.L sonnen, virtual power plant operator Next Kraftwerke, and power aggregator Lichtblick.  RENEWABLE ENERGY  Tesla\u2019s interest in renewable energy was one of the factors that led it to choose Brandenburg state around Berlin as the site for a new factory, a person familiar with the company\u2019s deliberations told Reuters.  In the first half of this year, some 65% of the electricity on the Brandenburg grid was generated from renewable sources, mostly wind. But like other areas in the north of the country, it often wastes energy because Germany\u2019s networks are limited in how much green power they can transport over long distances.  Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory 4 in Brandenburg will on its own require 100 megawatts (MW) of power and up to 400 MW if battery cell production is also launched, according to transmission grid operator 50Hertz.  Tesla is a long way from building up enough battery assets to deliver frequency regulation at grid scale, say specialists such as utility Axpo. But the company has made several steps to expand its energy activities in recent months.  In May, it applied for a UK licence to supply power, according to the Telegraph newspaper. It also uses a platform to bring users of its solar and Powerwall battery system into the electricity market in Australia.  \u201cThe next and obvious step for Tesla is to get into production, especially of renewable power,\u201d said consultant Berthold Hannes, who has 30 years of energy advisory experience.  \u201cTesla could use its own locations, for example the roofs of plants or the sites of charging points, and alternatively, or in addition, it could take stakes in solar plants or wind parks,\u201d he said.  Germany pioneered the solar power market, and is in the process of laying a policy framework that will make it easier for decentralised power generation and supply.  \u201cTesla\u2019s long-term plan definitely includes tackling the energy industry in a bigger way, though it\u2019s questionable whether it invests enough at the moment in that area,\u201d said a former member of Tesla management, who declined to be named.  Thomas Deser, a portfolio manager at Union Investment, said it was unlikely Tesla would enter the German electricity distribution business on its own - \u201cbut it could do so with a competent partner from the energy industry.\u201d","885":"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla Inc has obtained permission to start selling its Shanghai-made Model Y sports utility vehicle in China.  The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology published the approval on its website on Monday.  Tesla, now sells its Model 3 electric cars in China and has been building new car manufacturing capacity in Shanghai to make its Model Y SUVs. It applied for the Shanghai-made Model Y SUV sales permission earlier this month.  It started delivering vehicles made in its Shanghai factory last December and sold more than 13,000 vehicles in China in October.  The company has started exporting China-made Model 3 cars to Europe and said last week it plans to also start making electric vehicle chargers in China in 2021.","886":"NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - Lawyers for Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk will argue on Thursday that he did not violate a fraud settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and should not be held in contempt, the latest twist in a high-profile battle between the billionaire and the government.  Musk\u2019s fight with the SEC, to play out in a Manhattan federal court hearing, has raised investor worries that it could lead to restrictions on his activities or even his removal from Tesla, while distracting him at a pivotal point in the electric car maker\u2019s expansion.  Tesla, which built its reputation on luxury cars, has faced several production challenges with its Model 3 sedan, which it is counting on to reach the mass market, recently offering a version starting at $35,000.  The SEC on Feb. 25 accused Musk of violating his Oct. 2018 settlement by posting material information about Tesla on Twitter six days earlier, without first seeking approval from company lawyers.  Musk has countered that the information was not material, and did not need to be vetted.  The battle concerns a tweet that Musk sent to his more than 24 million Twitter followers: \u201cTesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019,\u201d meaning 500,000 vehicles.  Four hours later, Musk corrected himself, saying annualized production would probably be around 500,000 by year end, with full-year deliveries totaling 400,000.  The SEC said the earlier tweet contrasted with Tesla\u2019s Jan. 30 forecast that it would deliver about 400,000 vehicles this year.  Musk\u2019s lawyers countered that the earlier tweet merely restated a forecast he had given on Jan. 30, when he said Model 3 production could total 350,000 to 500,000 vehicles.  They have also said the SEC had conceded during settlement talks that Musk did not need pre-approval for all tweets about his Palo Alto, California-based company.  It is rare for the SEC to seek a contempt finding, though some legal experts said the regulator has a strong case over Musk\u2019s earlier tweet.  \u201cIt seems pretty clear that this particular tweet was not run through the scrubbing system that Tesla was supposed to have in place,\u201d said Stephen Diamond, who teaches securities law at Santa Clara University School of Law.  MUSK SAYS SEC \u2018BROKEN\u2019  A contempt finding by U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan could subject Musk to new sanctions such as a higher fine or removal from Tesla\u2019s board or as chief executive, legal experts said.  James Cox, a Duke University law professor, said Nathan was unlikely to impose a severe penalty such as giving up control over Tesla.  \u201cWe have to understand that Tesla is at a very important point in its history, and I don\u2019t think any judge would want to be viewed in hindsight as the cause of the demise of Tesla,\u201d he said.  \u201cShe could give him a good tongue-lashing, and tell him this is it, and next time she\u2019s not going to be so nice,\u201d Cox added.  The settlement resolved an SEC lawsuit that accused Musk of violating securities laws by tweeting last Aug. 7 that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private at $420 per share.  That tweet sent Tesla\u2019s share price up as much as 13.3 percent. Musk\u2019s privatization plan was at best in an early stage, however, and financing was not in place.  In settling, Musk agreed to step down as Tesla\u2019s chairman, and the company said it would adopt procedures to oversee all of Musk\u2019s communications, regardless of format, and pre-approve written communications that could be material to the company.  Tesla and Musk also agreed to each pay $20 million civil fines.  The legal battle, which began in September, has not stopped Musk from being an outspoken critic of the SEC.  He has since labeled the SEC the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission,\u201d recalling his attacks against hedge funds and other investors who sell Tesla stock short, hoping it will fall.  In a December interview with CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Musk said he did not have respect for the SEC. He also said his tweets had not been reviewed in advance since the settlement.  And in the early morning of Feb. 26, after the SEC filed its contempt motion, Musk tweeted: \u201cSomething is broken with SEC oversight.\u201d","887":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O set a record for quarterly vehicle deliveries in a triumphant response to months of questions about demand for its luxury electric cars, sending shares up 7% after hours on Tuesday.  Tesla did not comment on profit - which is still elusive - but the robust deliveries could help jumpstart investor sentiment on Tesla, which has been challenged in recent months. Before Tuesday\u2019s after-hours spike, Tesla shares were down about a third from the beginning of the year.  Brushing aside concerns about demand that have dogged the company all year, Tesla said orders during the second quarter exceeded deliveries, despite buyers getting a smaller tax credit.  A $7,500 U.S. federal tax credit was cut in half at the end of last year, fell to $1,875 on Monday and expires at the end of the year.  \u201cWe believe we are well positioned to continue growing total production and deliveries in Q3,\u201d the company said in a statement.  Tesla delivered 77,550 Model 3s in the quarter, the company\u2019s latest sedan and linchpin of the company\u2019s growth strategy. That compared with analysts\u2019 average estimate of 73,144, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Deliveries of all models rose 51% from the first quarter to 95,200 vehicles, including 17,650 Model S and X. Analysts on average were expecting total deliveries of 89,084.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has repeatedly said Tesla could deliver a record number of cars in the second quarter, beating the 90,700 it sent to customers in the final quarter of last year.  Tuesday\u2019s numbers helped take the sting off a difficult first quarter, in which deliveries plunged and the company lost $702 million.  That fraught quarter \u2013 hurt by logistics issues at Tesla\u2019s international ports and a drop-off in U.S. orders after the tax credit was halved \u2013 spurred worries that Tesla may have tapped a limited market for electric cars at premium prices.  Despite the positive second-quarter delivery numbers, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives cautioned that \u201cthe Street remains skeptical.\u201d  Demand and profitability will remain the two main drivers to buoy Tesla shares in coming quarters, Ives told Reuters, signaling that Tesla\u2019s challenges are far from over.  Garrett Nelson of CFRA Research noted that second-quarter deliveries were likely artificially boosted by customers pulling forward their vehicle purchases before the July 1 tax credit cut, warning that could result in a \u201csignificant retracement\u201d in deliveries in the third quarter.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  Tesla did not repeat its prior forecast that it would post a second-quarter loss but return to profit in the third quarter.  A big challenge for Tesla has been how to deliver its vehicles efficiently and swiftly to customers around the world. An improved system for logistics helped in the second quarter, Tesla said, without providing more detail.  In prior quarters, Tesla has diverted employees from all parts of the company to help with deliveries in an all-hands-on-deck effort to meet delivery goals. That has proved to be an expensive and inefficient way to meet targets, which reduces potential profit margins on each vehicle.  The delivery numbers included 10,600 vehicles that had been in transit at the end of the first quarter.  The company has pledged to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles in 2019, a goal many analysts predict will be difficult to meet.  Overall, total production rose 13% to 87,048 vehicles compared with the first quarter. The company churned out 72,531 Model 3s in the second quarter, up from a total of 62,950 Model 3s in the preceding quarter.  Tesla said that going forward, it would no longer disclose how many vehicles were in transit at the end of each quarter due to production changes that made the number less relevant. At the end of the second quarter, over 7,400 vehicles were in transit.","888":"(Corrects paragraph 2 to say battery business with Tesla narrowed losses, instead of generating profits)  * Maintains annual profit forecast at 300 bln yen  * Q2 sales down 2.5% to 1.95 trillion yen  TOKYO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp on Thursday reported a 12% drop in its second-quarter operating profit as the Japanese firm was hurt by the Sino-U.S. trade war and higher development costs related to its automotive business in Europe.  Still, its September-quarter earnings of 83.9 billion yen ($772.06 million) beat analysts\u2019 average estimate of 62.74 billion yen, according to Refinitiv data, as the battery business with Tesla Inc narrowed its losses.  A year earlier, Panasonic, the exclusive battery cell supplier for new electric vehicles (EVs) made by Tesla Inc , had earned 95.2 billion yen.  The company maintained its profit forecast for the year through March at 300 billion yen, compared with an average estimate of 293.94 billion yen from 19 analysts.  Panasonic has turned its focus away from low-margin consumer electronics and bet on businesses that sell to automakers as well as to corporations such as factory-owners and firms that automate processes.  But the shift has failed to lift profits at a time when the U.S.-China trade war has hit industrial purchases and output, and the global car market is contracting.  Tesla is also yet to show sustained profits. The Japanese company\u2019s chief executive, Kazuhiro Tsuga, has admitted he underestimated development costs for car components and risks associated with Tesla.  The electric carmaker surprised investors last week with a quarterly profit that sent its shares soaring.  Panasonic said on Thursday its automotive business, which includes car batteries, recorded an operating loss of 12.7 billion yen compared with a 7.1 billion yen loss in the year-ago quarter.  While Tsuga has promised to expand into \u201csolutions services\u201d for business customers by leveraging the company\u2019s expertise in various industries, he is yet to detail what that growth strategy would look like.  Tsuga is expected to hold a strategy briefing on Nov. 22. He was scheduled to attend an earnings briefing on Thursday, but cancelled earlier this week.

Every domestic automaker landed in the bottom half of the magazine\u2019s new-car reliability rankings, which include data collected for more than 500,000 vehicles. The survey, which ranked 29 brands in the U.S. market, was released on Wednesday.  \u201cIt\u2019s the complexities that have really dragged down Tesla,\u201d said Jake Fisher, the magazine\u2019s director of auto testing. \u201cThe majority of the problems that we\u2019re seeing with Tesla truly are mechanical issues.\u201d  The Model S appears similar to the model launched six years ago, but Tesla has made significant mechanical and software changes over the past few years, including making air suspension and all-wheel-drive standard, he said. That can hurt reliability as more complexity is added.  Toyota Motor Corp\u2019s Lexus and Toyota brands took the top two spots, as they have for six consecutive years. The survey results can be found at CR.org\/reliability.  The magazine\u2019s annual survey of new vehicle reliability predicts which cars will give owners fewer or more problems than their competitors, based on data collected. Its scorecard is influential among consumers and industry executives.  Tesla\u2019s ranking slid to No. 27, ahead of only General Motors Co\u2019s Cadillac brand and Volvo.  The Model S, which starts at $74,500, dropped to \u201cBelow Average\u201d from \u201cAbove Average\u201d last year, and its overall score denied it Consumer Reports\u2019 \u201cRecommended\u201d tag. Owners reported suspension problems and other issues, including the extending door handle, the magazine said.  Tesla\u2019s Model X SUV remained \u201cMuch Worse Than Average\u201d with ongoing problems, including the falcon-wing doors and center display screen. The Model 3 sedan, seen as key to Tesla\u2019s profitability, debuted with \u201cAverage\u201d reliability.  In May, Consumer Reports recommended the Model 3 after its latest tests showed a software update improved the car\u2019s braking.  Tesla is scheduled to report third-quarter results after the market closes on Wednesday.  Other domestic brand rankings included: Ford Motor Co\u2019s Ford and Lincoln brands at No. 18 and 20; GM\u2019s Buick, Chevrolet and GMC brands at No. 19, 23 and 25; and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles\u2019 Dodge, Jeep, Chrysler and Ram brands at No. 21, 22, 24 and 26, respectively.  Rounding out the survey\u2019s top five were Japan\u2019s Mazda Motor Corp, which registered the biggest gain, by nine spots; Subaru and Hyundai Motor Co\u2019s Kia brand. (Reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit; Editing by Dan Grebler)","890":"LOS ANGELES\/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Electric car maker Tesla Inc\u2019s move last week to cut 9 percent of its workforce will sharply downsize the residential solar business it bought two years ago in a controversial $2.6 billion deal, according to three internal company documents and seven current and former Tesla solar employees.  The latest cuts to the division that was once SolarCity - a sales and installation company founded by two cousins of Tesla CEO Elon Musk - include closing about a dozen installation facilities, according to internal company documents, and ending a retail partnership with Home Depot Inc that the current and former employees said generated about half of its sales.  About 60 installation facilities remain open, according to an internal company list reviewed by Reuters. An internal company email named 14 facilities slated for closure, but the other list included only 13 of those locations.  Tesla declined to comment on which sites it planned to shut down, how many employees would lose their jobs or what percentage of the solar workforce they represent.  The company said that cuts to its overall energy team - including batteries to store power - were in line with the broader 9 percent staff cut.  \u201cWe continue to expect that Tesla\u2019s solar and battery business will be the same size as automotive over the long term,\u201d the company said in a statement to Reuters.  The operational closures, which have not been previously reported, raise new questions about the viability of cash-strapped Tesla\u2019s solar business and Musk\u2019s rationale for a merger he once called a \u201cno brainer\u201d - but some investors have panned as a bailout of an affiliated firm at the expense of Tesla shareholders. Before the merger, Musk had served as chairman of SolarCity\u2019s board of directors.  The installation offices that the internal email said were targeted for closure were located in California, Maryland, New Jersey, Texas, New York, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Arizona and Delaware.  The company also fired dozens of solar customer service staffers at call centers in Nevada and Utah, according to the former Tesla employees, some of whom were terminated in last week\u2019s cuts. Those employees spoke on condition of anonymity because making public comments could violate the terms of their severance packages.  \u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult few days - no one can deny this,\u201d a Tesla manager wrote in a seperate internal email, sent to customer service employees shortly after the cuts were announced.  Tesla has been burning through cash as it tries to hit a target of producing 5,000 Model 3 electric sedans per week after production delays. The company faces investor pressure to turn a profit without having to tap Wall Street for additional capital.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The total number of cuts to the solar workforce remained unclear. Some personnel at facilities closing down were being transferred to other sites, the current and former employees said. SolarCity employed about 15,000 people at the end of 2015 but has since cut thousands of workers.  Ending the Home Depot partnership, which allowed for solar sales in about 800 stores, is part of Tesla\u2019s larger effort to absorb SolarCity into its high-end brand and sell through 90 of its 109 U.S. retail stores and its website, the company said.  \u201cTesla stores have some of the highest foot traffic of any retail space in the country,\u201d Tesla said.  Analysts questioned Tesla\u2019s plans for the solar business in light of the latest cuts to staff and retail operations.  \u201cIn effect they seem to be saying, \u2018We have no strategy for selling solar,\u2019\u201d said Frank Gillett, an analyst at Forrester Research, adding that the SolarCity purchase \u201clooks pretty awful right now.\u201d  FALLING SALES  In the first quarter of this year, Tesla installed 76 megawatts of solar systems - down from SolarCity\u2019s more than 200 MW a quarter in early 2016, when it was the leading player in the industry. In announcing quarterly results in February, Tesla said growth in solar deployments would resume later this year.  Tesla\u2019s falling solar sales also could jeopardize the future of a joint venture with Panasonic, announced as Tesla moved to acquire SolarCity in 2016, to produce solar modules at a new factory in Buffalo, New York.  Tesla has an agreement with New York state requiring the company to spend $5 billion within 10 years. If Tesla fails to meet that obligation and others, the company may be required to pay tens of millions of dollars in penalties at various milestones, could lose its lease, or be forced to write down the assets, the company told investors in a May filing.  In response to questions from Reuters, Tesla said it is meeting its hiring and spending commitments for the factory.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  In March, a Delaware judge ruled against a Tesla motion to dismiss a lawsuit by the company\u2019s shareholders over the SolarCity deal. The lawsuit alleged Tesla\u2019s board of directors breached its duties to shareholders by approving the merger.  SolarCity founder Lyndon Rive, who is Musk\u2019s first cousin and left Tesla last year, did not respond to a request for comment.  HIGH MARKETING COSTS  The move to end the longstanding Home Depot partnership blindsided many staffers because Tesla had announced an expansion of the arrangement as recently as February.  GTM Research analyst Austin Perea estimated the partnership has recently accounted for about half of sales, in part because of previous Tesla moves to cut back on other sales and marketing costs.  Such third-party retail partnerships are among the most expensive means of generating solar sales, according to the clean energy research firm, in part because retailers take a cut of each sale.  The cost of winning a customer through a store like Home Depot can be up to $7,000 per system, according to GTM Research, compared with a national average of $4,000 per installation.  Home Depot spokesman Stephen Holmes said the retailer\u2019s relationship with Tesla would last through the end of the year, adding that Home Depot would continue a partnership with Tesla competitor Sunrun in an undisclosed number of stores.  Over the past year, Tesla has stepped up efforts to sell solar and batteries for energy storage in its retail stores, something Musk said last year was \u201ca much more efficient channel for demand generation.\u201d  At the same time, Tesla stopped door-to-door sales, once among SolarCity\u2019s most successful means of reaching new customers, and salespeople were no longer allowed to hold local events or buy online leads, the former employees said.  Such tactics are standard practice across most of the competitive residential solar industry.  The Home Depot partnership was costly but also integral to Tesla\u2019s solar panel sales, a former employee told Reuters.  \u201cIt\u2019s an expensive account,\u201d the former employee said, \u201cbut it does bring in all the revenue.\u201d","891":"FILE PHOTO: A logo of Tesla Motors on an electric car model is seen outside a showroom in New York June 28, 2010.

Einhorn said his hedge fund and Tesla had \u201csome similarities and some differences\u201d.  \u201cWe both struggled last year. However, a key difference is that Greenlight\u2019s business has generated real profits for our investors since we began in 1996,\u201d Einhorn said.  Greenlight Capital first rose to prominence for making a prescient call on Lehman Brothers\u2019 accounting troubles before the firm\u2019s collapse.  Last year, it compared Tesla to Lehman and earlier this year said the company appeared to be \u201con the brink\u201d of failure.  Investors in the past have shown impatience with Tesla\u2019s failures to meet financial and production targets. The carmaker, however, put some concerns to rest after delivering a surprise profit in its third quarter.  Musk invited Einhorn to meet him and tour Tesla\u2019s facilities to learn about the company\u2019s progress.  \u201cFinally, please allow us to send you a small gift of short shorts to help you through this difficult time,\u201d Musk said, signing off as \u201cTreelon Musk.\u201d  Einhorn welcomed the offer to learn more about Tesla.  \u201cI think facility visits would be fun (can we start in Buffalo?). I might learn the difference between your alien dreadnought factory and cars made by hand in a tent.\u201d","893":"FILE PHOTO: The company logo is pictured on a Tesla Model X electric car in Berlin, Germany, November 13, 2019. REUTERS\/Fabrizio Bensch  (Reuters) - Tesla's TSLA.O stock extended its recent rally on Wednesday following a surge in China car registrations and after Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of the electric car maker with a \"buy\" recommendation.  Shares of the Silicon Valley automaker rose nearly 2%, bringing their gain this week to 26% as traders look beyond the short-term impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which has forced Tesla to close its California factory, furlough workers and cut salaries.  Tesla\u2019s China car registrations jumped 450% in March, month on month, data from auto consultancy LMC Automotive showed. Overall auto sales in China plunged 43.4% in March, as a coronavirus pandemic continued to depress demand.  In a note late on Tuesday, Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney started coverage of Tesla with a $864 price target, compared to its latest price of $723.  \u201cWe believe that the combination of Tesla\u2019s product leadership (including its over-the-air updates to continue to improve vehicle performance), brand\/early-mover advantage, vertical integration, and the long development cycles in autos (new cars can take 2-4 years to develop) will help Tesla to maintain a strong market position,\u201d Delaney wrote.  Wall Street has long been divided over Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk. Supporters expect Tesla to become a dominant global car maker, with a fleet of driverless taxis, while many skeptics doubt Tesla can become sustainably profitable.  Goldman Sachs\u2019 previous Tesla analyst, David Tamberrino, had a \u201csell\u201d rating and a $158 price target as of last June, the lowest on the street at that time.  Previously, in 2016, Goldman Sachs attracted attention when it upgraded Tesla to \u201cbuy\u201d just hours before the car maker announced a $2 billion stock offer with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley acting as joint lead bookrunners.  Tesla\u2019s stock has doubled from its March low and remains down 20% from its record high close in February, before fears about the impact of the coronavirus on the global economy triggered a deep stock market sell-off.","894":"FILE PHOTO: The Tesla logo is seen on a car at Tesla's new showroom in Manhattan's Meatpacking District in New York City, U.S., Dec. 14, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  (Reuters) - A former Tesla Inc factory employee will pay Elon Musk\u2019s electric car maker $400,000 after it accused him of tipping reporters about alleged production inefficiencies and delays, a court filing shows.  The payment by Martin Tripp, a former process technician at Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada, was part of a settlement disclosed on Monday and approved that day by Chief Judge Miranda Du of the federal court in Reno.  Tesla and Musk became embroiled in a public dispute with Tripp in June 2018, when it fired and then sued him.  The Palo Alto, California-based company accused Tripp of writing software to hack into its manufacturing operating system, stealing trade secrets, and making false claims to reporters about information he stole.  Du has said Tripp characterized himself as a whistleblower who had identified production inefficiencies and delays in Tesla\u2019s effort to produce 5,000 Model 3 cars each week.  In September, the judge dismissed Tripp\u2019s defamation counterclaim over statements from Tesla, including an email to employees where Musk accused him of \u201csabotage,\u201d saying Tripp did not show actual malice.  According to a court filing describing the settlement, Tripp did not contest Tesla\u2019s claims that he stole trade secrets, and acknowledged that his counterclaims were funded by a short seller of Tesla stock.  The filing was signed by Tripp and a Tesla lawyer.  The case is Tesla Inc v Tripp, U.S. District Court, District of Nevada, No. 18-00296.","895":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is pursuing a contempt order against Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk, saying he violated a fraud settlement by tweeting material information without preapproval, sending the firm\u2019s shares down 5 percent.  The SEC\u2019s request potentially could reopen a turbulent chapter for the electric vehicle maker in which regulators last year accused Musk of fraud for making misleading tweets about plans to take the company private, and demanded that he be stripped of his CEO title.  Musk, Tesla and the SEC settled the lawsuit, and part of the settlement called for any material statements made by Musk on social media to be vetted in advance by the company.  In a court filing on Monday, the regulator pointed to a Musk Feb. 19 tweet: \u201cTesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019,\u201d noting that Musk did not seek or receive preapproval before publishing this tweet, which was inaccurate and disseminated to over 24 million people.  \u201cMusk has thus violated the court\u2019s final judgment by engaging in the very conduct that the preapproval provision of the final judgment was designed to prevent,\u201d the SEC wrote in its motion filed on Monday in federal court in Manhattan.  The motion asks the judge to issue an order that would put the onus on Musk to show why he should not be held in contempt for violating the settlement.  Musk corrected his tweet four hours later to say that the \u201cannualized production rate\u201d at year-end 2019 would probably be about 500,000, with deliveries expected to be about 400,000.  Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Musk shot back on Twitter on Monday night, tweeting: \u201cSEC forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript, which clearly states 350k to 500k. How embarrassing \u2026\u201d.  Musk was referring to comments made by him in January to analysts that Tesla would make \u201cmaybe on the order of 350,000 to 500,000 Model 3s, something like that this year\u201d.  FILE PHOTO: Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk participates in a \"fireside chat\" at the National League of Cities (NLC) 2018 City Summit in Los Angeles, California, U.S. November 8, 2018. REUTERS\/Kyle Grillot  Tesla and Musk agreed in September to pay $20 million each to the SEC, and the billionaire stepped down as the company\u2019s chairman but remained as chief executive. In the settlement, the agency pulled back from its original demand that Musk, who is synonymous with the Tesla brand, be barred from running Tesla, a sanction many investors said would be disastrous.  The settlement was approved by a U.S. judge in October, who can now decide whether its terms have been violated.  \u201cNO RESPECT\u201d  Musk provoked the SEC even after the settlement was signed, calling the agency the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission\u201d on Twitter in October.  In a December interview with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d, Musk said none of his tweets had been censored since the settlement, and that only those that could cause Tesla stock to move would need to be reviewed.  \u201cI want to be clear. I do not have respect for the SEC,\u201d he said, adding that he respected the justice system.  In its fourth-quarter shareholder letter, Tesla said that, barring unexpected challenges with the new Shanghai factory, Tesla targeted annualized Model 3 production of over 500,000 units sometime between the fourth quarter, and the second quarter of next year.  In a response to the SEC\u2019s demand for information regarding the Feb. 19 tweet, a lawyer for Tesla and Musk said the CEO\u2019s tweet was meant to reiterate information already approved, then disseminated when the company released fourth-quarter earnings results in January.  Although the tweet was not pre-approved, the lawyer wrote, Musk believed its substance had been \u201cappropriately vetted, pre-approved and publicly disseminated.\u201d Moreover, the lawyer said, the statement was made outside of market trading hours.  It was not immediately clear what the repercussions would be were Musk to be found in contempt, as such a citation does not necessarily mean the original agreement is now null and void.  The SEC could seek a so-called bar order, removing him from Tesla\u2019s board, or could ask for a lesser penalty, like a monetary fine, said Stephen Diamond, a professor of corporate governance at Santa Clara University.  The SEC could also ask the court to reopen the original settlement for renegotiation, he said, perhaps asking that the original charges be reinstated.  \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty unusual situation,\u201d Diamond said, adding that \u201call bets are off\u201d.  Tesla\u2019s board has added new members as part of the settlement, moves that some outsiders hope will increase oversight of Musk. Board member Robyn Denholm also was made chairwoman after Musk was stripped of that role, but she has not commented on the new incident.  Charles Elson, director of the corporate governance center at the University of Delaware, said Tesla\u2019s board \u201cneeds to seriously reconsider the company\u2019s relationship with Mr. Musk\u201d.  \u201cThe board needs to act. End of story. And if they don\u2019t, the question is how responsible are they?\u201d","896":"FILE PHOTO: SpaceX founder Elon Musk smiles at a press conference following the first launch of a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S., February 6, 2018.

FILE PHOTO: A Tesla logo is seen at a groundbreaking ceremony of Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory in Shanghai, China January 7, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo - RC1BB6CDF460  The warranties will be sold in partnership with Endurance Warranty Services LLC and insurance company AmTrust Financial. Frisco, Texas-based Xcelerate already specializes in leasing Tesla vehicles to commercial customers.  A vehicle warranty acts like an insurance policy to cover vehicle repairs. Third-party policies are commonplace for traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.  As electric vehicles age and enter the used-car market, dealers have complained customers often refuse to buy them without this coverage, said Xcelerate vice president for sales Milad Davoodi, who previously worked as Tesla\u2019s global manager for trade-in and used vehicle operations.  \u201cThe only way to get an extended warranty agreement from Tesla is if you buy the vehicle new from Tesla,\u201d Davoodi said. \u201cIf you bought a car from a dealer, you\u2019re not qualified.\u201d  \u201cThis was a problem that had to be solved.\u201d  The product, X-Care EV Protection, covers all fully-electric vehicles on the market, such as Nissan Motor Co Ltd\u2019s Leaf and General Motors Co\u2019s Bolt, and will be sold through dealers plus directly online.  Xcelerate\u2019s product comes as Tesla has ramped up production of the Model 3.  Tesla delivered 145,610 Model 3s in 2018 and has promised to build 7,000 per week at its Fremont, California, factory by the end of 2019.  Davoodi said as the Model 3 is relatively new, it is hard to know what long-term problems it will experience, but so far some vehicles have had issues with suspensions, trunk latches, camera sensors and harnesses, he said.  Repair bills for some items could be high. The replacement cost for the unit controlling the 17-inch touchscreen in Tesla models is $3,000, Davoodi said.  The cost for a four-year, 50,000 mile extended warranty on a Model 3 if bought before the car hits the 5,000 mile mark is $3,200.  A warranty on a comparable passenger car with an internal combustion engine would generally be higher because it has more moving parts that are subject to wear and tear, industry analysts said.  The new warranty covers most major components, but does not include the drive battery pack or motor. Davoodi said Xcelerate is looking at the possibility of add-on coverage for the battery and motor.","900":"FILE PHOTO: Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveils the Roadster 2 during a presentation in Hawthorne, California, U.S., November 16, 2017.

FILE PHOTO: German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier attends the weekly cabinet meeting at the Chancellery in Berlin, Germany, October 2, 2019. REUTERS\/Michele Tantussi\/File Photo  The decision, announced by Tesla TSLA.O Chief Executive Elon Musk late on Tuesday, will see the U.S. electric vehicle pioneer build its first European factory and design centre near Berlin.  The move boosts Germany\u2019s efforts to position itself as an electromobility and battery cell production centre and will allow Tesla to produce cars \u201cMade in Germany\u201d as it seeks to burnish its reputation for reliability and sporting prowess.  The investment also cuts against the grain of troubled German trade ties with the United States, where President Donald Trump is threatening to hit the German auto sector with tariffs on cars imported to the United States.  \u201cWe see it as recognition of Germany as a location for making cars,\u201d Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said of Tesla\u2019s investment.  \u201cWe think we now have the chance, in the coming years, to become an important international centre in this future-oriented sector,\u201d he said.  The plan is also a shot in the arm for Germany as a centre for manufacturing after BMW and Mercedes in recent years chose to build new factories in Hungary, where production costs are lower, and after its auto industry was hit hard by Volkswagen\u2019s admission in 2015 that it cheated U.S. diesel emissions tests.  Germany\u2019s auto sector retains a reputation for top quality, however, and Berlin - which lost most of its manufacturing industry after the division of the city following World War Two - has morphed into a tech hub in the last decade.  Government spokesman Steffen Seibert said there had been no meeting between Musk and Chancellor Angela Merkel to seal the deal, but added recent measures to boost electric mobility made Germany a more attractive site.  The investment comes after Germany in September unveiled tax incentives to push electric cars and infrastructure after the government acknowledged it would miss a target to get one million electric cars on the road by 2020.  Now the government wants to have 10 million electric vehicles and 1 million charging stations by 2030.  Germany\u2019s environment ministry said the country\u2019s renewable energy drive was also attractive for a company like Tesla. \u201cTesla is a company that would like to have its energy come exclusively from renewable energy and Germany is a country with a clear goal (on renewables),\u201d a spokeswoman said.  \u2018NEW GOLDEN AGE\u2019  Tesla\u2019s proposed factory will be within commuting distance of Poland, where labour costs are cheaper, a rival manufacturer - who also looked at the site - told Reuters.  Still, Berlin\u2019s minister in charge of economic affairs, Ramona Pop, told public broadcaster RBB there had been talks about creating 6,000 to 7,000 jobs in production alone, with hundreds or even thousands more in areas such as design, software and research.  Brandenburg premier Dietmar Woidke said he had \u201clobbied for this for a long time\u201d. His state surrounding Berlin has, like much of the former Communist East, faced structural challenges since reunification in 1990.  Any official support given to Tesla would be in accordance with European Union rules, Woidke added.  \u201cSubsidies have not yet been discussed,\u201d Altmaier added. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Tesla - if it invests in Germany and creates jobs here, will be treated like all other companies in the automobile and automotive industry.\u201d  For a company yet to prove it can be consistently profitable, investing in high-cost economy is not without risks.  Alexander Ulrich, industry policy spokesman for the far-left Linke, said his party would support subsidies to Tesla, but only it adhered to \u201ccollective wage agreements and worker participation (in management) ... from day one.\u201d","906":"Slideshow ( 3 images )  (Reuters) - A machine used for paper recycling caught fire Thursday night at Tesla Inc's TSLA.O Fremont, California, campus, outside the company's car production factory, but manufacturing was not affected, the company said.

The fire happened in a tent used for recycling purposes on the south side of the company\u2019s campus, a company spokeswoman said on Friday.  \u201cLast night, the structure outside our factory that houses the cardboard and other wood and paper products that are being recycled caught fire,\u201d the spokeswoman said, adding that no injuries were reported, and the company was investigating the cause.

The Tesla spokeswoman said the production tent was not affected by the fire.  The Thursday fire is the latest in a series of blazes at the Fremont plant. The company suffered a fire earlier this month, according to an email sent to workers by Musk.  Tesla has been burning through cash as it tries to hit a target of producing 5,000 Model 3 electric sedans per week after production delays.

Flags fly over the Tesla Inc. Gigafactory 2, which is also known as RiverBend, a joint venture with Panasonic to produce solar panels and roof tiles in Buffalo, New York, U.S., August 2, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Repeated hold-ups since the Buffalo, New York plant opened last year have forced Tesla's partner in the joint venture, Panasonic 6752.T, to seek other buyers for the components it had built to sell to Tesla, according to a Panasonic employee, a former Panasonic employee and a former Tesla employee. The issues have also rattled the faith of state officials in Tesla's ability to deliver on investment and employment promises it made in exchange for $750 million in state subsidies.  The production challenges add to doubts over Tesla\u2019s cash-strapped solar operations as it focuses on boosting production of its better-known electric vehicles, which have also seen repeated production delays. Tesla acquired the solar business in 2016 in a controversial $2.6 billion purchase of SolarCity - a sales and installation company founded by two of Musk\u2019s cousins - but the business has been shrinking ever since.  (For a graphic showing the decline in Tesla's solar business, see: tmsnrt.rs\/2KjWlYU )  The \u201cSolar Roof\u201d produced at the New York factory is designed to look like a normal roof while generating electricity, a combination that has proved challenging.  \u201cAesthetic look is the key point that Elon is always not satisfied with,\u201d said another former Tesla employee, who works in Fremont, California. \u201cThat\u2019s the big issue.\u201d  In a call with Tesla investors last week, Musk said \u201chundreds\u201d of homes already had solar roofs, but the company clarified the estimate in its statement to Reuters, saying it included systems that had been partially installed or were \u201cbeing scheduled for install.\u201d  In California, the nation\u2019s leading solar market, there were twelve Tesla roof systems connected to the grid as of May 31, all in Northern California, according to records from the state\u2019s three investor-owned utilities. The cost per watt for those systems was listed at nearly $6, according to the records. That\u2019s about double the national average for solar systems.  Tesla began accepting $1,000 deposits from customers for the Solar Roofs in May 2017, seven months after it unveiled a prototype.  Tesla confirmed in a statement to Reuters that it has been seeking to improve on its production process for the solar roof at the New York plant.  \u201cWe are steadily ramping up Solar Roof production in Buffalo and are also continuing to iterate on the product design and production process,\u201c the company said in the statement. \u201cWe plan to ramp production more toward the end of 2018.\u201d  The company did not detail its current production and did not comment on its component purchases from partner Panasonic, which shares space in the factory and plans to produce Tesla solar panels and photovoltaic cells for the roofs.  Panasonic has been selling some of the solar panels it produces in Buffalo under its own brand instead of selling them to Tesla, Panasonic said in a statement.  Slideshow ( 9 images )  It has also been shipping a large volume of the photovoltaic cells it produces in Buffalo as samples to prospective buyers because of low demand from Tesla, according to the Panasonic employee and a former Tesla employee.  Panasonic declined to comment on the shipments of cell samples to other customers but said in a statement that it has not yet completed sales to buyers other than Tesla or signed alternate supply deals.  \u201cWe believe Tesla will use Panasonic cells when it mass-markets the Solar Roof,\u201d the company said in a statement.  Some New York state lawmakers worry Tesla may fail to hold up its end of the bargain. The state provided $350 million to build the factory, along with $274.7 million for equipment and $125.3 million \u201cfor additional specified scope costs,\u201d according to a Tesla filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The subsidy package requires Tesla to employ 1,460 people in Buffalo, including 500 at the plant, within two years of the facility\u2019s completion, and to spend $5 billion in the state over a decade.  Empire State Development, the state\u2019s economic development arm, is overseeing the agreement. The agency believes Tesla is currently meeting its obligations, said spokeswoman Pamm Lent, adding that the company would face penalties of $41.2 million a year if it falters.  Republican New York state Assemblyman Ray Walter, who represents a district near the factory, said it concerned him that only a small portion of the plant appeared functional when he toured it in March.  \u201cAfter investing $750 million of taxpayer money, we want it to work out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just does not look like it\u2019s heading down that path.\u201d  Tesla said in its statement that the facility now employs about 600 people and is on track to meet all of its commitments.  None of the Tesla sources could provide a production figure for the solar roof, saying only that output was low and frequently interrupted. They said only the textured black version of the solar roof had been produced so far, one of four varieties Tesla is marketing.  Several of the sources at the plant said Musk had never visited the site; Tesla declined to comment.  EQUIPMENT IN BOXES  Panasonic recently produced about 1,900 conventional 325-watt solar panels per day at the plant, meant to be sold under the Tesla brand, and about 2,000 5.5-watt photovoltaic cells per day that were intended for the solar roof, according to two Panasonic sources, one who recently left the company.  That would put annualized production at about a quarter of Tesla\u2019s target for the plant, which is 1 gigawatt per year by 2019. And Tesla isn\u2019t buying most of the cells being produced, according to the Panasonic employee.  \u201cWe have been entertaining outside customers,\u201d the employee said.  Tesla is also turning to other suppliers to deal with the aesthetic concerns, using cells from JA Solar because they reflect light differently, said a current Tesla employee and a former Tesla employee. The current employee said a similar Panasonic cell was now undergoing testing and would be used in future versions of the solar roof.  JA Solar declined to comment.  Panasonic started cell production at the factory in February, but recently shut down manufacturing to install new equipment on its production lines, the Panasonic employee said. Full production will restart in September, the employee said.  For now, wooden crates filled with unused equipment are sitting around the factory, according to the Panasonic employee and three other employees with knowledge of the plant operations. Some of that equipment has become obsolete over the past couple of years as technology has changed, two of the workers said.  MIXED REVIEWS  One of the few customers that has taken delivery of the Solar Roof is Tri Huynh, 39, who works in business development in Silicon Valley. Huynh said he paid about $100,000 for the system, which included three Tesla Powerwall home batteries to store the power produced.  It took two weeks and a dozen workers to install, compared to a day for most traditional panel systems.  \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic. I love it,\u201d he said, adding he was saving hundreds of dollars a month in power costs. \u201cI\u2019m a tech guy, so I kind of wanted the latest technology.\u201d  Warren Jason, a retired technology entrepreneur who is building an 11,000-square-foot house in the Hollywood Hills, is not so pleased.  He put down $1,000 to reserve a roof in early 2017 but it has not yet arrived, and he has been unable to get details to give to his architect and engineers.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been begging Tesla for information,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been extremely frustrating.\u201d","908":"July 2 (Reuters) - Shares of billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla Inc fell in volatile trading on Monday as investors pocketed some profits after the company announced it had hit a production milestone for its Model 3 cars.  Tesla shares were last down 2.5 percent at $334.23 in brisk trading after the company said it met a long-elusive weekly production target of 5,000 Model 3 cars, reaffirmed its financial guidance and committed to increase production to 6,000 per week by late August.  Earlier in the session the heavily shorted stock had risen as high as $364.78, up 6.4 percent. Trading volume was 1.5 times the 10-day moving average.  But the pullback in shares showed that investors were not won over by the news as they eyed lower-than-expected delivery numbers, the financial impact of ramping up production and the quality of the cars being built.  While UBS analyst Colin Langan said there was some relief the company hit the target, he noted that second-quarter vehicle deliveries of 40,740 missed his expectation for 51,000 and the consensus estimate of 49,000.  He also questioned whether the company could keep up the faster production and its profit outlook.  \u201cWe\u2019re very worried about quality and if you read the reports online there\u2019s significant quality issues. They still haven\u2019t proven they can produce these profitably. The math is very challenging in getting to a sustained profit,\u201d said Langan.  While Tesla forecast positive net income for the third and fourth quarters, Langan was less optimistic, saying he does not expect a net profit in the third quarter and that a fourth-quarter net profit could be temporary as the average price of the cars sold will likely come down in 2019.  Tesla stock rose 10 percent on June 6 when Musk said the company was on track to hit the 5,000 weekly target. The stock continued to rise for much of June, ending trading on Friday 17.8 percent higher than the closing price on June 5.  \u201cThe stock had already priced in hitting the target,\u201d said Langan.  David Kudla, founder and chief executive of Mainstay Capital Management in Grand Blanc, Michigan, said Monday\u2019s news did not change his recommendation to short Tesla stock. Selling shares short is a bet that the share price will fall  \u201cThe push to meet these self-imposed targets makes one question what cost was incurred to build these cars and how was quality adversely impacted,\u201d said Kudla, who is personally short the stock.  \u201cWhether somebody is short at $361 or $300 they\u2019re going to be fine. In a month second-quarter earnings will come out and that\u2019s when we\u2019ll see how financials are impacted,\u201d he said.  As of Friday\u2019s close, 34.83 million Tesla shares or 27.5 percent of the shares available for trading were sold short, according Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director at S3 Partners a financial analytics firm.  Short sellers had not covered their positions ahead of Monday\u2019s announcement, according to Dusaniwsky who said it was too soon to report on Monday\u2019s short activity.  \u201cI\u2019m surprised there wasn\u2019t more activity long and short on Friday,\u201d he said. \u201cYou wonder are traders maxed out on risk on Tesla. At a certain point you\u2019re gorged. You can\u2019t take another bite.\u201d","909":"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Bitcoin stalled just short of the $50,000 mark on Monday and other cryptocurrencies slipped, as investors took profit from a record-breaking rally that is being driven by a worldwide shift in investor and public attitudes towards digital assets.  FILE PHOTO: A collection of bitcoin (virtual currency) tokens are displayed in this picture illustration taken Dec. 8, 2017. REUTERS\/Benoit Tessier\/Illustration\/File Photo  Bitcoin fell as much as 5.6% to $45,914 in Asian trading hours, after having posting a record high of $49,714.66 on Sunday. Rival crypto ethereum slid more than 8%, though both later pared some of those losses.  The dip, for now, taps the brakes on a surge that has vaulted the cryptocurrency from the fringes of finance to Wall Street, as big investors and large companies have begun to take the digital asset seriously and started to buy a lot of it.  Bitcoin is up about 20% in the week since electric carmaker Tesla Inc announced it had $1.5 billion in bitcoin and would accept the currency as payment. It has gained more than 60% for the year to date and more than 1,100% since last March.  \u201cThere\u2019s this unadulterated wave of big players (buying) that has continued to push the price higher,\u201d said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone. \u201cWe might be seeing one or two big funds just cashing out,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe big question is: OK, you want to buy the pullback, but how big is the pullback that we are talking about?\u201d  Lunar New Year holidays in Hong Kong and China also kept a lid on moves in Asia, while a tweet from Tesla boss and crypto advocate Elon Musk appeared to weigh on the price of dogecoin, which he had previously promoted.  \u201cIf major dogecoin holders sell most of their coins, it will get my full support,\u201d he tweeted.  Dogecoin, a dog-themed currency created as a joke has been volatile in recent weeks owing to a number of Musk tweets referring to it.  It has dropped 18.3% to $0.0536 in the past 24 hours according to CoinDesk. Ethereum last sat at $1,740, about 7% below last week\u2019s record high of $1,879.  GO WEST  Bitcoin\u2019s rise has a cryptocurrency that is still hardly used for transactions on the verge of $50,000 - a far cry from software developer Laszlo Hanyecz\u2019s 2010 purchase of two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins.  But in contrast to previous speculative bitcoin rallies, driven by traders mostly in Asia, gains in the past few months have been driven by a seismic shift in U.S. investors\u2019 attitude.  Tesla\u2019s investment followed multimillion-dollar bitcoin purchases by business software firm MicroStrategy and a number of Wall Street fund managers, such as billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller, sounding positive on the asset.  Bloomberg reported on Saturday that Morgan Stanley\u2019s investment arm is also weighing a bet on bitcoin.  Meanwhile, bitcoin has made strides toward being a medium of exchange, with PayPal allowing customers to use bitcoin at its merchants and Mastercard preparing to permit cryptocurrency use across its vast network.  Bank of NY Mellon last week said it formed a new unit to help clients own and trade digital assets and Japanese financial conglomerate SBI Holdings is in talks with foreign firms for its own crypto joint venture.  \u201cIn the crypto space, these institutions coming to the party are seen as steps towards acceptable and possible usage,\u201d said Michael McCarthy, chief strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.  Bitcoin has been the most prominent beneficiary, he said, but price moves in other cryptocurrencies - such as EOS, which has more than doubled since late December according to CoinDesk - show that the door remains open to rivals.  \u201cThe race is on amongst those candidates,\u201d he said.","910":"The body of a Tesla Model S is transported by an automated crane at the Tesla factory in Fremont, California October 1, 2011.

The electric car maker told Reuters on Wednesday production of 100,000 Model S and Model X vehicles is now possible in a two-shift cycle with minimal overtime, compared with three shifts and considerable overtime earlier.  Tesla was responding to a CNBC report that said the company was churning out a high ratio of flawed parts leading to costly rework and production delays, citing several current and former employees.  The company\u2019s shares closed down 4.4 percent at $326.63 on Wednesday.","911":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O posted its second quarterly profit in a row as vehicle deliveries hit a record and the company said it would comfortably make more than half a million units this year, pushing its shares to new highs.  The delivery forecast, higher by more than a third than last year\u2019s production, suggests Tesla is looking at a steadier chapter after years of steep losses, production troubles and clashes between chief executive Elon Musk and U.S. regulators.  The electric carmaker\u2019s stock, which has nearly doubled in the past year, jumped 13% after hours on Wednesday, cracking the $600 mark for the first time.  Tesla said that the manufacturing process at its new Shanghai factory, which started delivering Model 3 sedans a month ago, was running as expected and that it would increase production of the mass-market cars because of strong demand in China.  The $2 billion Shanghai factory is key to Tesla\u2019s growth strategy. There it aims to produce 150,000 Model 3 sedans and later increase output to 250,000 a year, including the Model Y.  But the company warned of a 1-1.5 week delay in the ramp of Shanghai-built Model 3 cars because China ordered a shutdown of the factory after a new coronavirus breakout that has killed 170 people and infected thousands.  \u201cThis may slightly impact profitability for the quarter but is limited as the profit contribution from Model 3 Shanghai remains in the early stages,\u201d Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer Zachary Kirkhorn said on a post-earnings call.  The company is evaluating whether it will be hurt by the virus and whether the supply chain for cars built in its Fremont, California plant will be affected, he said.  Tesla said it started production of the new electric crossover utility vehicle Model Y at the Fremont factory this month and plans to deliver the first cars by the end of March, ahead of schedule.  Tesla already starting Model Y production was the most notable item in the release, Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin wrote in a note.  \u201cFor a company that has always been late, this is a big improvement,\u201d he said.  Tesla super chargers are shown in Mojave, California, U.S. July 10, 2019. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Tesla initially did not expect to make the Model Y until late 2020 and then moved up the forecast to this summer, finally beating that deadline by several months.  COST CONTROL  The results indicate that Tesla is controlling costs better, a metric that investors have questioned Musk on before and that he was quick to talk about on the call.  \u201cIn 2019, we managed to generate more than $1 billion of free cash flow while building a factory in Shanghai in record time and while building parts of Model Y production,\u201d he said.  Tesla\u2019s cash balance increased to $6.3 billion and total operating expenses rose less than 1% to $1.03 billion in the December quarter.  And while its revenue per unit delivered rose by only 3% in the fourth quarter, operating profits per vehicle rose by roughly 19%.  (Graphic: )  Tesla, which last week overtook Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE as the second-most valuable carmaker behind Japan's Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, still trails luxury carmaker rivals on steady profits per vehicle, a key metric.  (Graphic: )  Some analysts have questioned the more than $104 billion valuation, but investors are betting that Tesla has overcome its many struggles and can compete with larger, better capitalized rivals to lead the industry in technological innovation for next-generation cars.  The company\u2019s debt pile is high as well, amounting to $13.42 billion at the end of 2019.  Tesla reported a 4.9% operating margin in the fourth quarter and said Model Y production and the Shanghai factory ramp-up were likely to weigh on margins temporarily.  Its new initiatives, which also include the construction of its first European factory in Germany, an electric pickup truck, a new generation of the Tesla Roadster and automated driving features, are also likely to put a strain on its cash pile.  Net income attributable to common shareholders fell to $105 million, or 56 cents per share, for the three months ended Dec. 31, from $140 million, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier.  Revenue rose to $7.38 billion from $7.23 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $7.02 billion.

In a filing on Monday, the SEC said that in a tweet on Feb. 19 Musk had broken a promise made last year to have his public statements vetted by the company\u2019s board, part of the deal.  The regulator did not say what remedy it wanted the court to impose, but the commitment was part of a settlement that headed off demands from the SEC for Musk to resign as Tesla CEO, seen by investors in the company as a substantial risk to its future.  Musk, who initially on Monday accused the SEC of failing to read the company\u2019s annual reports, followed up with another tweet in the early hours of Tuesday.  \u201cSomething is broken with SEC oversight,\u201d he wrote.

It did not provide figures or a timeframe for its plans to triple cylindrical battery capacity.  LG Chem, along with CATL, supplies batteries for Tesla\u2019s made-in China models, while Panasonic makes batteries for Tesla\u2019s U.S-made cars.  LG Chem also said it was developing \u201cnew form-factor\u201d cylindrical batteries which will boost energy density five-fold and power by six-fold, without elaborating.  These are similar to targets that Tesla announced last month for its new batteries to be made in-house, called 4680 cells, to enable a 16% increase in range for Tesla vehicles.  The CEO of LG Chem, which has production facilities in Poland, the United States, South Korea and China, shared a plan to build another site in Europe in an interview last week.

Its battery division, which also includes small batteries used in Apple\u2019s iPhones, saw operating profit more than double from a year earlier to 169 billion won, thanks to rising cylindrical battery sales, new EV launches by European automakers and higher sales of new mobile devices.  Operating profit at the mainstay petrochemical business also more than doubled to 722 billion won, as the coronavirus crisis lifted demand for home appliances and hygiene products like surgical gloves.

In an announcement on Thursday, Elon Musk-led Tesla also lowered the prices on all of its cars by up to 6 percent. It was the third cut this year for the Model 3 after a $2,000 price cut in January and a $1,100 reduction last month.  \u201cTaken in conjunction with the introduction of the $35k Model 3, we view this (price cuts) as confirmation that demand for Tesla vehicles has softened,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a client note.  Tesla said it now expects to record a loss in the first quarter after being \u201coptimistic\u201d about being profitable in every quarter of 2019.  The company attributed the potential loss to one-time charges and said it would likely be profitable in the second quarter.  Tesla shares were last down 3.5 percent at $308.75  Investors have wondered whether Tesla, which has never posted an annual profit, will need to raise more capital to fund its expansion and pay off billions of dollars of maturing debts in coming years. The company is due to repay a $920 million convertible bond on Friday.  Since unveiling the Model 3 in 2016, Musk has been promising a $35,000 version. A lower-priced Model 3 is seen critical to its long-term viability as it needs to reach more customers who can afford the vehicles to offset slowing sales of costlier sedans.  The lower price could expand the Model 3 market by about 600,000 cars in the United States alone, based on historical sales figures for similarly priced sedans, Baird analyst Ben Kalo wrote in a note to clients.  The new shorter-range Model 3 will now be less expensive than its gasoline-powered counterparts such as a $37,500 Audi A4, $41,000 Mercedes C Class and the BMW 3 Series priced at $40,000.  To save costs on its cheaper Model 3 version, Tesla plans to close most of its 250 stores and sell cars online.  \u201cWe do not think this was the original plan envisaged by Tesla management and bullish investors,\u201d JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note.  \u201cThe Model 3 would prove more difficult and more expensive to manufacture than was originally projected, such that the firm would struggle to earn its targeted above industry average 25 percent gross margin as it transitions toward industry average pricing,\u201d they said.

FILE PHOTO: Tesla Motors Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk pauses during a news conference in Tokyo September 8, 2014. REUTERS\/Toru Hanai\/File Photo  Explaining his reversal in a late-night blog post on Friday, the billionaire CEO said that taking the company private \u201cwould be even more time-consuming and distracting than initially anticipated,\u201d and that \u201cmost of Tesla\u2019s existing shareholders believe we are better off as a public company.\u201d  It was on Aug. 7 that Musk first surprised investors with his plan by tweeting that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d for a go-private deal, which would have had a value of $72 billion. In a separate tweet, he wrote: \u201cInvestor support is confirmed.\u201d [L2N1VG01J]  Musk and Tesla are facing investor lawsuits and a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the truthfulness of the CEO\u2019S Aug. 7 tweets, according to an Aug. 8 report by the Wall Street Journal.  The SEC declined to confirm that report to Reuters. A Tesla spokesman declined to comment.  \u201cThe SEC will continue its investigation until it\u2019s satisfied that it is on top of the facts,\u201d said Stephen Crimmins, an attorney with Murphy & McGonigle who spent 14 years at the SEC, where he prosecuted hundreds of securities cases.  \u201cWhat happened on Friday will be of interest to the SEC because it will allow them to probe whether Musk\u2019s pulling back from the go-private somehow indicates that he did not have a reasonable basis for his statement. They will be asking questions of him and others involved in the decision as to why he reversed course.\u201d  Musk has stuck to his original statement that he believed a deal was possible, and one person familiar with the discussions told Reuters that Musk was serious about taking the carmaker private.  But acting in good faith may not be enough to help Musk escape the regulator\u2019s gaze.  U.S. securities law requires public company executives to have a \u201creasonable basis\u201d on which to make representations to the investing public, and that would likely be the focus of an SEC probe, said three securities lawyers.  It remains unclear what Musk meant by \u201cfunding secured.\u201d In an Aug. 13 statement, Musk said that he left a July 31 meeting with the managing director of Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund \u201cwith no question that a deal ... could be closed.\u201d  The Saudi fund had earlier acquired a just-below 5 percent stake in Tesla on the open market. But the fund has made no comment on whether it had promised to back a much larger Tesla go-private deal.  \u2018FUNDING SECURED\u2019  Musk said on Friday he believed there was plenty of potential funding to take the company private, but he did not provide any further details to bolster his \u201cfunding secured\u201d assertion.  Teresa Goody, CEO of law firm Goody Counsel and a former SEC attorney, said Musk\u2019s statement on Friday appeared to undermine his Aug. 7 tweet that investor support was confirmed.  She also raised concerns about a second comment Musk made on Friday, where he said it had become apparent that compliance restrictions would prevent many of Tesla\u2019s institutional shareholders from holding private Tesla equity.  Both statements are likely to raise further questions among SEC officials as to whether Musk had performed sufficient due diligence to have had a reasonable basis for his Aug. 7 tweets, she said.  Another statement in the blog that could catch the eye of SEC officials is Musk\u2019s reference to his discussion with Tesla\u2019s board on Thursday, during which both parties decided not to pursue the deal, said M. Ridgway Barker, a partner and chair of the corporate finance practice at law firm Withersworldwide.  Such discussions are unlikely to be subject to legal privilege and the SEC could subpoena minutes of the meeting, he said.  \u201cIf the board discussion included that the deal is not financeable, or prohibitively expensive, that is going to cast further doubt over Musk\u2019s claims,\u201d he said.","919":"Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk speaks at an opening ceremony for Tesla China-made Model Y program in Shanghai, China January 7, 2020.  LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk is giving his rivals the heavy metal blues. By securing 6,000 tonnes a year of cobalt directly from mining giant Glencore\u2019s Democratic Republic of Congo operations, the Tesla boss is guaranteeing plentiful supplies of the battery ingredient while minimising headaches over its provenance. With China hoovering up more and more of the blue metal, he\u2019s also putting the squeeze on electric vehicle competitors like General Motors and Volkswagen.  DRC should wield more power over the cobalt market than Saudi Arabia does over the oil one. Its south-eastern Katanga region is home to two-thirds of the metal\u2019s available reserves. But DRC\u2019s reputation for conflict and strife makes it risky and expensive to get at. Hence why Musk has always expressed a preference for engineering cobalt out of Tesla car batteries.  Securing a quarter of Glencore\u2019s Katanga Copper Company\u2019s cobalt, around 4% of world output, suggests that preference is still some way from reality. It\u2019s nearly four times what Tesla used in 2019, according to consultancy Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. By focusing on the only non-Chinese cobalt miner in DRC, Musk is also minimising the risk of labour abuse expos\u00e9s, especially when Covid-19 is hampering normal on-the-ground supply-chain auditing. Glencore\u2019s more mechanised operations make it unlikely that cobalt from rocks dug out by DRC\u2019s legions of pick-wielding informal miners, some of them children, finds its way into Tesla batteries. That\u2019s less verifiable with smaller-scale Chinese producers.  Musk\u2019s Western rivals will find it harder to find similar peace of mind, especially as Volkswagen, BMW and General Motors\u2019 vehicle batteries all use more cobalt. This year, Glencore\u2019s DRC mines will produce 26,000 tonnes of cobalt ore, about 18% of global supply. Chinese operators like China Molybdenum, will produce another 37%. Yet off-take agreements with miners like Glencore, which sends half its DRC cobalt ore to Chinese processors like Gem Jiangsu Cobalt Industries, mean that Chinese refineries control almost 70% of the world\u2019s refined cobalt, according to BMI.  With Tesla and China tying up almost three-quarters of the world\u2019s available supplies, there will be less for everybody else. The metal is currently fetching just $30,000 a tonne, a third of its 2018 peak, due largely to a glut of supply from DRC\u2019s informal miners. As and when prices recover, Musk will be insulated.","920":"June 23 (Reuters) - A central Texas county may decide as early as next week whether to approve millions in tax subsidies to Tesla Inc if it builds a $1.1 billion vehicle factory in their community.  Commissioners in Travis County, which includes Austin, heard conflicting opinions from residents in a hearing on Tuesday.  Tesla has said it wants to start building a large vehicle assembly plant in the southwestern United States as early as the third quarter of this year, and the company is also still considering another location in Oklahoma.  Tesla has asked Travis County for an 80% rebate on its property taxes for 10 years, then a 65% rebate for the next 10 years. The rebate would be worth $14.7 million in the first 10 years.  \u201cWe will take no action today, will be back on the agenda next week. We might make a decision then, depending on the court\u2019s readiness,\u201d County Judge Samuel Briscoe said at the end of Tuesday\u2019s virtual hearing of the county commissioner\u2019s court.  During the nearly four-hour session, residents spoke both in favor and against the factory.  \u201cInstead of focusing to get people a living wage...you\u2019re giving tax breaks to a company that\u2019s worth billions. It makes no sense,\u201d said Silvia Zuvieta-Rodriguez, a student at the University of Texas.  Several participants voiced concerns over Tesla\u2019s friction during the coronavirus pandemic with officials in the California county where its sole U.S. vehicle factory is located.  Other residents said they felt honored that Tesla chose the community, calling the company\u2019s potential move to the area a \u201cgame changer\u201d and an \u201cincredible chance.\u201d  \u201cPlease, let\u2019s not miss this opportunity and give this up to another city,\u201d said resident Diane Webb.  Tesla executives told the meeting the new factory would create at least 5,000 jobs, the majority for low-skilled workers. A county official said many low-skilled individuals had become unemployed during the coronavirus pandemic.  Tesla said the average annual salary would be roughly $47,000, an income considered low by the county\u2019s health and human services division.  Tesla has pledged to invest at least 10% of its tax rebate in community education and housing programs, but some residents questioned the use of taxpayer money to subsidize low-paying jobs.

Musk, Tesla\u2019s chairman and chief executive, has been directly involved in almost every detail of its Tesla\u2019s product development and technology strategy, and is credited as the driving force behind the loss-making company\u2019s ability to raise capital.  The cost of insuring Tesla debt against default rose to its highest price ever on Thursday and the plummeting share price attracted new short sellers, who bet against the stock. Short sellers notched $1.27 billion Thursday alone in paper profits, and Tesla recently regained the title of most-shorted U.S. stock, according to S3 Partners.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused Musk on Thursday of tweeting false and misleading information in August about financing for his now-abandoned plan to take the company private, and said it was seeking to remove him as an officer or director. Musk said he had done nothing wrong and the company\u2019s board said it supported him.  Musk, 47, walked away at the last minute from a settlement with the SEC that would have required him to give up key leadership roles at the company for two years and pay a nominal fine, according to reports on Friday.  But sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, told Reuters that while Musk was ready to go to trial he could still settle. They did not discuss possible terms.  CNBC reported that Musk had turned down an SEC deal to give up his role as chairman, while Fox Business Network reported that Musk had been offered a temporary ban as CEO.  Musk has hired Stephen Best at Brown Rudnick, who successfully defended internet billionaire Mark Cuban in an insider trading case, according to people familiar with the plans who also asked not to be identified. He also hired former Assistant U.S. Attorney Chris Clark of Latham & Watkins to defend him in the case, the people said.  Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The SEC declined to comment on the settlement reports.  One person with knowledge of the SEC\u2019s thinking said on Friday that the SEC lawsuit or a potential settlement did not preclude further action by the Justice Department.  The Justice Department declined to comment.  In previous fraud cases such as blood-testing firm Theranos, the Justice Department brought criminal charges three months after the SEC announced its settlement with the company\u2019s founder Elizabeth Holmes.  The Justice Department\u2019s criminal probes typically take longer since the standard of proof is higher than the SEC\u2019s civil cases, said legal experts.  \u201cA lot of the time they do work together, but the DOJ\u2019s investigation may go on longer. The SEC wouldn\u2019t delay its case for the DOJ,\u201d Teresa Goody, CEO of law firm Goody Counsel and a former SEC attorney.  UNCERTAIN FUTURE  At least five research firms said Musk might have to resign following the SEC lawsuit.  \u201cI think it was a big mistake to turn down the settlement offer,\u201d CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson said.  Some analysts said the SEC\u2019s action was the beginning of a legal battle with authorities, short-sellers and other investors over Musk\u2019s actions that could cost Tesla heavily.  Musk has driven the company to the verge of profitability with a costly ramp-up of production of its Model 3 sedan over the past year.  Electric vehicle news site Electrek reported that Tesla had produced 51,000 Model 3s with a couple of days left in the quarter, hitting its goal of 50,000 to 55,000 Model 3s.  \u201cThe bottom line is, what he did was stupid, it was wrong, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be thrown out,\u201d said a large Tesla investor, who asked not to be identified due to sensitivity of the situation.  \u201cMy guess is he\u2019ll pay a big fine. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if as a settlement to the SEC he drops his chair of the board\u201d role.  Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at financial analytics firm S3 Partners, said in an email that he had seen several hundred thousand shares of new short selling in Tesla.  Short interest in Tesla shares totals nearly $10.2 billion, with more than 33.1 million shares sold short, roughly 26 percent of its float, he said.  Shares were last down 13 percent at $267.46 in afternoon trading, wiping about $7 billion off Tesla\u2019s market value.  The SEC\u2019s lawsuit, filed in Manhattan federal court, caps a tumultuous two months set in motion on Aug. 7 when Musk told his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take Tesla private at $420 per share, with \u201cfunding secured.\u201d  The regulator charged that Musk \u201cknew or was reckless in not knowing\u201d that his tweets were false and misleading.","922":"(Repeats with no changes to text)  BEIJING, March 10 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc plans to increase its production capacity for certain car parts at its $2 billion factory in China, according to a government document seen by Reuters, as it pushes to localise its supply chain in the world\u2019s biggest auto market.  The U.S. automaker, which started delivering Model 3 electric sedans from its Shanghai factory in December, plans to add lines to make more battery packs, electric motors, and motor controllers, according to the document submitted by Tesla to Shanghai government.  Tesla, which as of end-December used about 70% imported parts for the cars it made in China, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.  But according to the document, Tesla wants to almost double its annual building capacity for cooling pipes, a key part in a car\u2019s heat management system, to 260,000 sets a year from 150,000. It did not provide capacity details for other parts.  The planned production line will not include battery cell manufacturing but will package out-sourced battery cells at the plant, the document said.  Tesla has previously said it wants to localise its entire supply chain in China by the end of this year.  The company is also building an additional stamping line to speed up car production in Shanghai, according to construction documents seen by Reuters.  The Shanghai factory is key to Tesla\u2019s growth strategy. There it aims to produce 150,000 Model 3 sedans and later hike output to 250,000 a year, including the Model Y, according to a Shanghai government filing in 2018.  The company aims to deliver more than 500,000 vehicles globally by end-2020.  Tesla\u2019s production and delivery plans in Shanghai, however, have been disrupted by a coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 3,100 people in the world\u2019s No.2 economy.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Trump told Reuters in an interview in January that \u201cwe have helped to build China because they have taken out so much money in terms of trade deficits with this country.\u201d  He added that \u201cwhen China or another country charges us 50 percent tariffs \u2013 more than that in some cases \u2013 and we charge them nothing, that\u2019s not fair.

Those are problems for Tesla, which wants to expand its presence in China\u2019s growing electric vehicle market without compromising its independence or intellectual property.  China said last year it would gradually reduce its auto import tariffs.  Musk noted that a U.S. car \u201cgoing to China pays 25% import duty, but a Chinese car coming to the US only pays 2.5%, a tenfold difference.\u201d  He asked Trump: \u201cDo you think the US & China should have equal & fair rules for cars?

How can the chief executive deliver on his many goals without a fresh infusion of outside cash?  FILE PHOTO: A Tesla car charges at a charging station in Beijing, China, April 18, 2017. REUTERS\/Thomas Peter\/File Photo  The California-based Tesla faces a crucial time in its 15-year history. Production setbacks with its new Model 3 - the hotly anticipated sedan Tesla vowed would push electric vehicles into the mainstream - have cast a shadow over Musk\u2019s promises and judgment. A host of new projects in the pipeline, from a semi truck to an SUV, now appear to some analysts as expensive, time-consuming distractions, even as rival automakers come to market with their own electric offerings.  A capital raise would raise alarm bells with investors as the company continues to burn money. Tesla reports first-quarter results on May 2.  Understanding Musk\u2019s bullish prediction is a complex accounting exercise that relies on multiple best-case scenarios. These include: building a promised 5,000 Model 3 sedans per week by the end of the second quarter; curtailing or deferring high spending that added up to $3.4 billion in capital expenditures in 2017; and improving gross margins.  The dearth of information about Tesla\u2019s multiple capital-intensive projects - from the Model Y crossover this year, the partially built battery Gigafactory in Nevada, and the Semi truck and Roadster, forecast to begin production in 2019 and 2020 - complicates the task.  \u201cThere are a lot of moving parts there,\u201d Andrew Walker of Rangeley Capital, which holds a small short position in Tesla, said on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s just so many questions and such a black box, it\u2019s very difficult to determine going forward.\u201d Shorts bet that a share price will fall.  Tesla shares were up 1 percent at $283.67 on Thursday afternoon. Its shares have fallen over 9 percent so far this year.  UBS analyst Colin Langan has estimated that Tesla - which ended 2017 with $3.37 billion in cash - could fall below a cushion of $1 billion at the end of June due to estimated negative free cash flow of $1.6 billion in the first half of the year. Some, like Bernstein, put that estimate higher, at negative $1.8 billion.  Subtracting another $1.2 billion for 2018 debt refinancing and accrued liabilities reduces Tesla\u2019s cash level to $600 million, UBS calculates. Using a more bullish free cash flow model, such as Morgan Stanley\u2019s first-half estimate of negative $880 million, Tesla would still hover just above the cushion, at $1.3 billion.  \u201cTesla may not \u2018need\u2019 to raise funds, but many investors expect that the company will very much \u2018want\u2019 to,\u201d wrote Morgan Stanley\u2019s Adam Jonas in a note published last week.  Much hinges on efficient, volume production of the Model 3 along with tight spending control.  Tesla aims to build 3,000-4,000 Model 3s per week next month, up from more than 2,000 Model 3s today, and to increase production to 5,000 by the end of the second quarter.  Building 5,000 Model 3s per week priced at $44,000 would yield revenue of $2.64 billion per quarter, although efficiency determines how much of that trickles down to the bottom line.  But those calculations may be moot. Morgan Stanley\u2019s Jonas noted that \u201cno investor that we have spoken to expects Model 3 production of 5k\/week by the end of 2Q\u201918.\u201d  \u2018LOSING CREDIBILITY\u2019  Tesla has repeatedly underestimated its capital requirements and has raised money, whether through equity or debt, even after claiming it had no need to do so.  \u201cThe company\u2019s financial predictions may be losing credibility within the financial community,\u201d wrote Cowen & Co analyst Jeffrey Osborne in a note to clients earlier this month.  Since March, short interest in the stock has risen sharply to 30 percent of float, or shares available for trading.  Currently, analysts, on average, predict Tesla will not reach profitability on a non-GAAP basis until the first quarter of 2019. According to Thomson Reuters data, analysts see adjusted losses of $217.6 million and $40.1 million in the third and fourth quarters, respectively, after revising estimates downward to twice the losses they expected at the end of 2017.  They expect, on average, negative cash flow of $125 million and $67 million in the third and fourth quarters.  Other one-off factors influencing profit include the sale of zero emission vehicle (ZEV) credits or deposits from Model Y customers. Musk\u2019s recent admission that he erred in adding too much automation into the Model 3 assembly line could also prove an expensive mistake to unwind.  The Model 3 targets a 25 percent gross margin when fully ramped, but with production line stoppages and the need to hire 400 more hourly workers, the vehicle\u2019s negative margins today could be further pressured in the short-term.  With all that in mind, a 2018 capital raise, according to UBS\u2019s Langan, is \u201ca question of when, not if.\u201d","927":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  BOSTON (Reuters) - One day after Tesla Inc posted its third quarterly profit in a row, hedge fund manager David Einhorn, one of the electric carmaker\u2019s best-known critics, lobbed questions about the company\u2019s financials at its two top executives.  Taking to Twitter on Thursday, Einhorn asked Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk and chief financial officer Zach Kirkhorn about Tesla\u2019s accounts receivable, costs, idled factories and the impact of currency market movements on the company.  \u201cCan you or (Zack) explain,\u201d Einhorn wrote, misspelling the CFO\u2019s first name in the tweet. Without answers, the investor added, he would continue to wonder \u201cif not only your accounts receivable are suspect, but your income statement as well.\u201d  Einhorn has 48,000 followers on Twitter and his message hit a nerve after Musk on Wednesday overshadowed his company\u2019s strong first quarter results with comments about stay-at-home restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus. Musk called for an end to California\u2019s stay-at-home orders, describing them as \u201cfascist\u201d and a \u201cserious risk\u201d to his business.  The hedge fund manager\u2019s Thursday tweet was retweeted nearly 700 times and liked more than 2,500 times. Representatives for Einhorn and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Einhorn and Musk have a history of taunting each other on social media.  Greenlight Capital\u2019s Einhorn has long bet that Tesla\u2019s share price would drop, holding onto a view that has hurt his portfolio. In January, Einhorn told his investors in a letter that his negative view on Tesla is reflected by his purchase of put options. In the first quarter Greenlight Capital lost 21.5%, an investor said.  Tesla reported a first quarter profit of $1.24 per share, beating analysts\u2019 forecasts for a loss of 36 cents per share. Strong demand for its Model 3 vehicle and the sale of regulatory credits helped fuel the gain. Tesla\u2019s share price has surged 91% since January, recovering quickly from a sharp slump in March when stocks tumbled amid fears over the coronavirus outbreak.","928":"BEIJING (Reuters) - China\u2019s electric vehicle startups are on the charge again, thanks to Tesla.  An Aiways U5 electric car is displayed at a company store in Shanghai, China September 22, 2020. Picture taken September 22, 2020. REUTERS\/Aly Song  The country\u2019s growing fascination with the U.S. pioneer\u2019s sleek designs and cutting-edge technology is giving a string of second-wave home-grown Tesla wannabes the traction to raise more funding, expand production and boost sales.  Chinese EV startups NIO, XPeng Inc, Li Auto and WM Motor have raised more than $8 billion between them this year and now rival Aiways is planning to go public, its co-founder and President Fu Qiang told Reuters.  Speaking ahead of the Beijing auto show which starts on Saturday, Fu said the relative success of U.S. initial public offerings (IPO) by XPeng and Li Auto had helped fuel the company\u2019s ambitions to list.  Since it was founded in 2017 in Shanghai, Aiways has raised \u201cno more than 10 billion yuan\u201d and it will need to secure more funding from some private equity funds and other investors, said Fu, the former head of Volvo Cars China who has also been an executive at Mercedes-Benz, Skoda and FAW-Volkswagen.  \u201cIPO is also in our plans, and we\u2019re planning to push ahead with it,\u201d Fu said, adding that Aiways would most likely be listed within China, declining to elaborate further.  China has been the world\u2019s fastest-growing EV market for years helped by generous state purchase subsidies but the sales boom started to sputter last year as Beijing began cutting back financial support and watering down other pro-EV policies.  Some prominent Chinese EV startups such as Byton and Singulato have struggled and NIO\u2019s future looked in doubt last year. But a surge in Tesla\u2019s market value - and its sales in China - suggest the country\u2019s EV dream is far from over.  \u201cAs Tesla stock goes, so goes the fate for electric vehicle startups,\u201d said China auto expert Mike Dunne. \u201cFunds are flowing like a river in spring again. Tesla could end up pulling everyone into the future sooner than expected.\u201d  \u2018JUST OUT OF THE GATE\u2019  Tesla\u2019s sales in China in the first eight months of 2020 have nearly tripled from a year ago to 73,658 cars, according to consulting firm LMC Automotive, despite the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Some Chinese auto executives say cars made by the company from Palo Alto, California are achieving the status of Apple\u2019s first iPhones in China and with so many potential technological advances still to come, that gives them hope.  Fu believes the revived interest in EVs in China is partly because EV owners are fascinated by intelligent driving functions, as well as the interactive, so-called connected services that many newer models are starting to come with.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  \u201cToday\u2019s smart, connected cars aren\u2019t that smart. We\u2019re just out of the gate and are in a stage that could be described as iPhone 1 or the original iPhone,\u201d Aiways President Fu said. \u201cAs that gets developed step-by-step, in the near future we will get to iPhone 8, iPhone 9 and iPhone 10.\u201d  Dunne, too, said Tesla was the primary factor sustaining interest in EVs among consumers and investors in China, and elsewhere in the world. Tesla\u2019s shares have surged 10-fold over the past 12 months and it became the world\u2019s most valuable car company in July.  And cheaper running costs are also a significant factor.  Cui Yihua, who sells aquariums in the eastern city of Suzhou, Jiangsu province, switched from his gas-guzzling Audi Q7 to save cash and chose an electric-blue Aiways U5 sports-utility vehicle (SUV) after also test-driving a Tesla Model 3, saying he liked the U5\u2019s interior design, its colour and extra space.  \u201cI have charging facilities in my housing compound, in the parking garage downstairs. I put a 100-yuan deposit down for charging and I\u2019ve been using it for two weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s negligible compared to gasoline-fueled cars.\u201d  PRIVATE OWNERS  Automakers in China that were part of the initial wave of EV startups sold or leased many of their cars to drivers working for ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing and rival taxi services who were spurred on by rebates and other policy support for EVs.  Now, Fu and NIO co-founder and Chief Executive William Li believe China\u2019s EV marketplace is driven more by private car owners and their pure interest in electric cars.  That\u2019s most evident in the performance of Tesla\u2019s Model 3 sedan, which is perceived by many consumers as fairly affordable at about 270,000 yuan ($39,750) after purchase subsidies.  Credit also goes to Wuling, a General Motors Co joint venture, whose Hongguang Mini EV has become China\u2019s best-selling electric car this year, in part because its cheapest model sells for just 28,800 yuan.  To be sure, some companies hit hard by the initial slowdown in EV sales are still in limbo. Byton has suspended its business for six months through January and is working on a restructuring of its operations, a spokeswoman said.  Singulato, meanwhile, is operating on a limited capacity and is looking for further funding to finish developing two cars and launch them, a senior company source told Reuters.  But executives say raising funds has become markedly easier this year, and their confidence levels are climbing too.  NIO, for example, has raised $3.8 billion this year to get back on track, mostly through state-affiliated funds in the eastern Chinese province of Anhui, and also with commercial paper and additional shares, its spokesman said.  WM Motor, backed by China\u2019s most widely used internet search engine Baidu, raised $1.5 billion this week. XPeng Inc and Li Auto raised $1.5 billion and $1.1 billion respectively through U.S. listings in July and August.  \u2018DEMAND IS REALLY STRONG\u2019  While sales of what China defines as new energy vehicles (NEV) - all-electric cars, plug-in electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles - started to contract more than a year ago, they jumped 26% in August after a 19.3% rise in July, which ended 12 months of year-on-year declines.  LMC Automotive expects sales of passenger NEVs to fall 8.9% this year but surge 48.4% in 2021 to hit 1.52 million vehicles, or 7% of expected passenger car sales. LMC\u2019s Shanghai-based analyst Alan Kang expects NEV sales to accelerate mainly because Beijing recently enacted tougher green-car quotas for carmakers.  Fu said sales of the Aiways U5, its first model, have gained momentum since April to surpass 1,400 in the three months through August, when it also unveiled its sportier SUV U6 ion.  Within a year, he thinks Aiways could reach sales of 10,000 cars in China, with another 3,000 from Europe, where it has started selling in Germany. It plans to expend into Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland.  In NIO\u2019s case, sales of its ES8 and ES6 models zoomed to 10,331 vehicles in the second quarter, half of its 2019 sales and almost matching sales of 11,348 for all of 2018, when only its seven-seater ES8 SUV was on offer.  NIO\u2019s overall gross margin turned positive in the second quarter and hit 9.7% for vehicle sales. Operating losses shrank nearly 65% from a year earlier to 1.1 billion yuan.  \u201cWe think we have decisively overcome the difficulties of last year,\u201d Chief Executive Li, who says he still flies economy to save the company money, told Reuters.  \u201cDemand is really strong. If you place an order with us right now you will need to wait for a really long time to pick up your new car,\u201d Li said. \u201cOur main challenge in the fourth quarter is to improve our production capability.\u201d","929":"May 21 (Reuters) - Consumer Reports on Monday said that flaws with Tesla Inc\u2019s Model 3 sedan prevented it from earning its recommendation.

Tesla\u2019s stopping distance of 152 feet from 60 mph was far worse than any contemporary car tested by Consumer Reports and about seven feet longer than the stopping distance of a Ford F-150 full-sized pickup, the magazine said.

FILE PHOTO: Tesla CEO Elon Musk arrives at Manhattan federal court for a hearing on his fraud settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in New York City, U.S., April 4, 2019. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton\/File Photo  U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan extended the deadline by one week to April 25, in response to a Thursday court filing where both sides requested the extension and said \u201cdiscussions are ongoing.\u201d  Nathan had been asked to hold Musk in contempt over a Feb. 19 tweet that the SEC said violated an earlier settlement with the agency.  If Musk and the agency fail to resolve the dispute, the judge said she would rule on the contempt request.  The SEC sued Musk last year after he tweeted on Aug. 7 that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The agency said the tweet, which sent Tesla\u2019s share price up as much as 13.3 percent, violated securities laws. Musk\u2019s privatization plan was at best in an early stage and financing was not in place.  Musk settled the lawsuit, agreeing to step down as chairman and have the company\u2019s lawyers pre-approve written communications with material information about the company, including tweets.  In February, the SEC accused Musk of violating that settlement by sending a tweet about Tesla\u2019s production that had not been vetted by the company\u2019s attorneys, and asked U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan to hold him in contempt.  Musk\u2019s lawyers have argued that the tweet did not contain new information that was material to investors, and that Musk did not need pre-approval for all tweets about Tesla under the settlement.  At an April 4 hearing, a lawyer for the SEC said that if Musk were found in contempt, the agency would ask the judge to require him to submit regular reports about his Twitter use, and to pay a series of progressively higher fines for any future violations.  Nathan declined to rule on the contempt motion at the hearing, instead ordering Musk and Tesla to meet and try to resolve the dispute on their own.  Musk is worth $20.7 billion, according to Forbes magazine. He has been chief executive of Tesla since 2008 and has more than 25 million followers on Twitter.  The Palo Alto, California-based company built its reputation on luxury cars, but has faced several production challenges with its Model 3 sedan, which it hopes will reach a mass audience.  The Feb. 19 tweet that prompted the SEC\u2019s contempt motion said: \u201cTesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019,\u201d meaning 500,000 vehicles.  Four hours later, Musk corrected himself, saying annualized production would be \u201cprobably around\u201d 500,000 by year end, with full-year deliveries totaling about 400,000.  The SEC said the earlier tweet conflicted with Tesla\u2019s Jan. 30 outlook, when it targeted annualized Model 3 production exceeding 500,000 as soon as the fourth quarter, and projected 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries this year.  Musk\u2019s lawyers have argued that the first tweet did not contain new information that was material to investors, and that Musk did not need pre-approval for all tweets about Tesla under the settlement.  Musk has been an outspoken critic of the SEC throughout his legal dispute with the SEC, which he once dubbed the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission.\u201d  In the early morning of Feb. 26, after the regulator filed its contempt motion, Musk tweeted: \u201cSomething is broken with SEC oversight.\u201d","932":"BEIJING\/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. carmaker Tesla Inc has hiked prices on its Model X and S cars by about 20 percent in China, the first automaker to do so in the world\u2019s top automotive market in response to mounting trade tensions between the countries.  The move is the earliest indication of how much higher Chinese tariffs on certain U.S. imports will flow through to buyers, with other automakers likely to follow suit or shift a greater portion of production to China.  \u201cIt\u2019s only chapter one of this story,\u201d said James Chao, a Shanghai-based analyst at consultancy IHS Markit, who expects more companies worldwide to be hurt by the trade spat.  China slapped retaliatory tariffs of 25 percent on imports of several U.S. products, including cars, after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods.  China\u2019s tariffs are expected to hurt automakers, firms that make industrial components in the United States, and producers of soybean, whisky and other agricultural items.  For Tesla especially, rapidly burning cash and struggling to turn a profit, China is key. Sales in the country accounted for about 17 percent of its revenue last year.  In May, Tesla slashed up to $14,000 off its Model X in China after Beijing said it would cut import tariffs to 15 percent from 25 percent for most vehicles from July 1.  But the latest retaliatory tariffs mean importers will have to fork out a total 40 percent duty on all U.S.-made cars they sell in China.  Tesla\u2019s price hikes kicked in over the weekend.

These prices are more than 70 percent higher than in the United States where the basic Model S sedan sells for $74,500.  \u201cRaising the prices is going to hurt sales, but money-losing Tesla has to raise prices because they can\u2019t afford to fully absorb the higher costs of the tariffs,\u201d CFRA research analyst Efraim Levy said. \u201cConsidering they claim to be capacity-constrained, they should be able to shift sales elsewhere.\u201d  NEW TESLA PLANT  Tesla\u2019s price increases come as it plans to build a factory in Shanghai to serve the Chinese market. The company ships more than 15,000 cars a year to China.  CEO Elon Musk is expected to visit Shanghai on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the plans. Musk will also visit Beijing on Wednesday and Thursday, Bloomberg added, quoting one of the sources.  Tesla did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.  Analysts were divided on whether the price hikes will bother affluent buyers in China where, in big cities like Shanghai and Shenze, it is considered a status symbol to own a Tesla.  \u201cTesla consumers are a unique group of rich people. They want more of a brand image and product experience, price is less of a concern,\u201d said Yale Zhang, head of Automotive Foresight.  IHS Markit\u2019s Chao, however, said many wealthy Chinese buyers were becoming more price conscious.  Other foreign automakers that could announce price increases in China include German automakers BMW and Daimler AG.  BMW recently said it was unable to \u201ccompletely absorb\u201d the new tariffs, while Daimler has flagged that it \u201caims to maintain a competitive position\u201d in China. Both firms import U.S.-produced cars into the Asian nation.  Ford Motor Co has, however, said it would not hike prices on its imported cars for now, crimping its profit margins.","933":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk personally owes $507 million to Wall Street banks involved in Tesla\u2019s stock and debt sale, backed by his stake in the electric car maker, a company filing showed on Thursday.  FILE PHOTO: Tesla CEO Elon Musk leaves Manhattan federal court after a hearing on his fraud settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in New York City, U.S. April 4, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The lending was disclosed in Tesla\u2019s prospectus on Thursday to raise up to $2.3 billion with new shares and convertible debt, and it was $117 million less than the personal loans to Musk disclosed in Tesla\u2019s previous prospectus in 2017.  Still, Tesla said that if the price of its stock falls and the banks force Musk to sell some of his shares, that could create additional pressure on the stock.  Tesla jumped over 4% after Tesla disclosed capital raising plans, which soothed investors\u2019 recent concerns about the Palo Alto, California company and pulled its stock up from two-year lows.  Musk, who owns 20% of Tesla, has taken personal loans from Wall Street banks for years. A Tesla 2017 prospectus showed $624 million in loans to Musk.  The filing on Thursday showed Musk owed money to three banks working on the capital increase.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc has $213 million in loans outstanding to Musk, while he owes Morgan Stanley $209 million, and another $85 million to Bank of America Corp . Goldman was not mentioned as a personal lender to Musk in the 2017 filing.  Those loans are backed by Musk\u2019s shares in Tesla, currently worth a total of around $8 billion. If Tesla\u2019s stock declines, then Musk could be forced to sell some of those shares under terms of the loan, according to the Tesla filing.  Mark Williams, a professor of finance at Boston University, said that investment banks can run into conflicts of interest with their deals with companies, their founders and CEOs, testing their rules to keep different businesses separate.  \u201cThis is particularly true in the case of Tesla where you have an aggressive and vocal CEO who is prone to pushing the legal limits and gain terms that might run counter to Goldman\u2019s conflict of interest policies,\u201d Williams said.  Goldman and Citigroup Inc, the top-line book runners in Thursday\u2019s capital raise, both have \u201csell\u201d ratings on Tesla\u2019s stock, which is unusual but not exceptional on Wall Street.  At the end of 2018, Musk and his trust had 13.4 million Tesla shares pledged as collateral for personal debts, according to another filing. That is down from 13.8 million shares at the end of 2017.  Tesla, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs declined to talk about the loans. Tesla has a policy that caps executives\u2019 borrowings at a quarter of the value of the shares pledged as collateral.  With Tesla repeatedly pushing back forecasts for turning a profit, its stock has dropped 27% year to date.  Musk plans to buy another $10 million worth of shares as part of the sale announced on Thursday.","934":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. electric car maker Tesla cut the starting price of its Chinese-made Model 3 sedans on Thursday by about 8% to 249,900 yuan ($36,805), once Chinese subsidies for electric vehicles are taken into account, according to its China website.  Previously, the starting price for Model 3 sedans made in Tesla\u2019s Shanghai factory with a standard driving range was 271,550 yuan, after state purchase subsidies.  Sources told Reuters that the standard range Model 3 sedans would now come with lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries which are cheaper than the nickel-cobalt-manganese (NMC) cells it used previously.  Tesla did not disclose what batteries the cheaper version uses.  The price for Model 3 vehicles with a longer range is now 309,900 yuan, down from 344,050 yuan.  Tesla started to deliver cars from the Shanghai factory in December, helping it save on shipping costs and tariffs for imported models.

REUTERS\/Kim Kyung-Hoon\/File photo  TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan\u2019s Panasonic Corp has appointed its head of automotive business Yuki Kusumi as the company\u2019s next chief executive officer, replacing Kazuhiro Tsuga, who was the architect of a partnership with Tesla Inc.  The 55-year-old will take the reins on April 1, Panasonic said on Friday, after a three-decade career at the company which has seen Kusumi lead the automotive component business and the TV operations, much like his predecessor. Tsuga, 63, will become chairman.  The change comes as Panasonic has begun to benefit from a partnership with Tesla, which was central to the incumbent chief\u2019s strategy.  Strong sales of Tesla electric vehicles (EV) have allowed Panasonic\u2019s battery business to eke out profits this year, following several years of production troubles and delays at the U.S. partner.  Kusumi also oversaw the launch of a joint battery venture with Toyota Motor Corp in April, which took over Panasonic\u2019s business in thin, rectangular-shaped prismatic batteries, a different format from cylindrical batteries used in Tesla EVs.  Under Tsuga\u2019s 8-year leadership, Panasonic has shifted its focus away from low-margin consumer electronics to batteries, factory machines and components. Panasonic\u2019s partnership with Tesla includes a $1.6 billion bet on a battery joint venture in Nevada, which was signed in 2014.  The company focus on business customers, however, has yet to generate stable profits, and the new chief is likely to be tasked with further overhauling a sprawling business portfolio that ranges from facial steamers to bicycles.  Price pressure on the battery business for Tesla could also intensify as the U.S. company has outlined a plan to halve the cost of its EV batteries and bring more production of the key auto component in-house.  Panasonic said separately that it would change to a holding company structure in April 2022, to clarify responsibilities of each business division and speed up decision-making processes.","936":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Wednesday it was lowering the price of its Model 3 sedan for the second time this year, moves that come in the wake of Tesla losing a tax credit that made its cars more affordable for U.S. buyers.  The company is ramping up production of the Model 3 and trying to make it more accessible for mainstream car buyers. Tesla has also been cutting costs as it looks to turn in profits this year.  A U.S. federal tax credit began phasing out for Tesla in January, effectively raising the price of cars by $3,750. Tesla said on Tuesday it had cut the Model 3 price by $1,100, following a cut of as much as $2,000 in January.  That leaves the starting price of a Model 3 at $42,900, still substantially above the $35,000 price Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk originally promised.  Musk told a Twitter user that the company is \u201cdoing everything we can\u201d to drop the Model 3 base price to $35,000, without credits. \u201cIt\u2019s a super hard grind,\u201d he wrote.  The billionaire in the past few months has been pushing for cost-cutting initiatives, like cutting jobs and ending a customer referral program. Tesla said in a statement that ending the costly referral program allowed it to cut the Model 3 price.  The referral program that ended at the beginning of February gave new buyers six months of free charging and prizes for existing owners such as launching personal photos into deep space or invites to a Tesla event.  Tesla delivered fewer-than-expected Model 3 sedans in the fourth quarter.

Panasonic, which is contributing about $1.6 billion to Tesla\u2019s $5 billion \u201cGigafactory\u201d, \u201cwould consider additional investment if we are requested to do so,\u201d Yoshio Ito, the chief of Panasonic\u2019s automotive business, said at a media roundtable in response to a question about whether the Japanese firm would increase its investment.  Panasonic is the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla\u2019s current production models, producing them in Japan as well as at the Gigafactory, which Panasonic jointly operates.

FILE PHOTO: A car enthusiast cleans the windshield of his Studebaker cabriolet during a parade on the Place de la Concorde organized as part of the Paris auto show, which is celebrating its 120th edition, in Paris, France, September 30, 2018. REUTERS\/Benoit Tessier\/File Photo  A new BMW 3-series sedan, the latest in a line of cars that defined the concept of a premium sports sedan, will aim to reinvigorate a range that has ceded ground to SUVs and electric drives, while the Mercedes GLE marks an attempt to take an SUV to a new level, with some autonomous driving features.  And the Peugeot e-Legend concept stands for what automakers need to do next, and fast: design electrified vehicles that are both appealing and profitable.  The new generation BMW BMWG.DE 3-series sedan will immediately fight for attention with a different car bearing the \"3\" designation - Tesla Inc's TSLA.O electric Model 3.  Tesla\u2019s Model 3 is now out-selling the BMW model in the United States, although the BMW 3 remains the bigger seller by far worldwide.  Tesla\u2019s all-electric car challenges BMW and other traditional premium brands for technological leadership with software that can be constantly upgraded to improve the car\u2019s performance and driver experience, and to add features.  The new BMW 3-series will also fight for attention in Paris - as in the marketplace - with the worldwide shift to SUVs. That phenomenon will be represented by the new generation of the Mercedes DAIGn.DE GLE sport utility, among other models.  CONFLICTED RESPONSE  The new GLE, which goes on sale next year, will come with a new, 48-volt electronic suspension system that can vary the shock absorbing function at each wheel, individually. Inside the cabin, drivers and passengers can view information on two 12.3- inch screens.  The GLE also takes another step toward automating the process of driving, with a system that can steer and vary the speed of the car within a marked lane up to 37 miles per hour. The GLE can effectively pilot itself in rush hour traffic jams.  Mercedes will offer in the GLE a 48-volt electrical system that gives the vehicle an electric boost away from stops. That offers a modest reduction in fuel consumption at a time when regulators worldwide want automakers to eliminate their oil-burning, internal combustion technology and go all-electric.  The GLE highlights the auto industry\u2019s conflicted response to the regulatory and consumer pressure to dump diesel technology and accelerate the shift to all-electric vehicles.  Petroleum-fueled SUVs such as the Mercedes GLE generate the bulk of profits for global automakers. All-electric Tesla gets praise for its innovation, but is scrambling to show a profit in the third quarter after a tumultuous year.  FANTASY CAR  The challenge for established automakers is to design electric cars compelling enough to persuade consumers to pay a profitable premium to own them.  Legacy automakers have tended to produce electric cars that are drab, small or strange.  PSA Group's PEUP.PA Peugeot e-Legend concept aims to break that pattern with a battery-powered homage to the 1968 Peugeot 504 that looks like it could have starred in a late 1960s French New Wave movie.  While not destined for production, the e-Legend does reflect a dilemma facing automakers like PSA - and its track-racing boss Carlos Tavares - over how to reconcile connected, autonomous cars with more traditional product traits such as driving pleasure, where their expertise really lies.  While the Peugeot fantasy car is self-driving, it can also be driven manually, or flipped into a \u201csharp\u201d autonomous mode that accelerates and steers more aggressively - because, as the company said in promoting the concept, \u201cboredom is not part of our DNA\u201d.","939":"Nov 24 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk indicated in a tweet on Sunday that the company now has 187,000 orders for its electric pickup truck, up 41,000 in about 24 hours.

It would have to be a state-by-state proposition,\u201d Edmonds said.  Tesla last week said it was launching an insurance service designed to give drivers in California, its biggest market, lower rates because of safety features on its electric vehicles.  The company did not name an insurance partner, but the California Department of Insurance website showed Tesla was licensed as a broker to conduct business on behalf of the State National Insurance Company Inc, a unit of Markel Corp MKL.N.  Chief Executive Elon Musk has been one of the strongest proponents of the idea that car insurance rates should plummet as driver-assist and self-driving technology become standard.  U.S. insurers say they currently do not have sufficient data to validate auto industry promises of safety benefits from automated driving systems, citing automakers\u2019 reluctance to provide detailed information on models sold with those features, a lack of consistent standards, drivers\u2019 unpredictable use of the systems and higher repair costs.  Tesla is one of the few manufacturers whose vehicles are largely standard-equipped with advanced driver assistance features, including cameras monitoring lane keeping and recording vehicle surroundings.

REUTERS\/Jason Reed  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk\u2019s 2019 is shaping up to be a matter of flourish or fold. Tesla\u2019s chief executive presided over a $139 million fourth-quarter profit, unveiled after markets closed on Wednesday. Trouble is, it took cost cuts at the $53 billion electric-car maker to eke out even that, which was less than half the profit in the previous three months \u2013 itself Tesla\u2019s first black ink in ages.  One big challenge is slowing growth. Revenue from automotive sales increased just 3.3 percent in the fourth quarter from the third, despite a big push to persuade Americans to buy vehicles before a $7,500 tax credit for Tesla buyers was halved at the end of December. The company has since dropped prices on all its vehicles.  The implication may be that U.S. demand for the supposedly mass-market Model 3 is tapering off. It may change once Tesla starts selling the $35,000 version. But that\u2019s 41 percent below the average sticker price to date, so the company will have to sell far more cars to make up the revenue. And rivals from BMW to General Motors are spending heavily to erase Tesla\u2019s electric-vehicle lead.  Meanwhile, automotive-sales costs increased faster than the unit\u2019s top line. Tesla is bringing down some expenses, including a nearly $200 million cut to capital expenditure in the final three months of the year. Earlier this month, Musk said he would lay off 7 percent of the workforce.  The net result so far is that Tesla had some $3.7 billion of accessible cash on its balance sheet at the end of 2018, though a quarter of that is probably needed to pay off a convertible bond coming due in March. The question is whether that\u2019s enough.  Slowing sales growth and lower prices could mean less free cash flow. Meanwhile, Musk may need to invest more to fund developments like the Model Y and the Semi truck.  Also, the cuts may prove damagingly deep. Customer gripes already abound. Owners have taken to social media to detail everything from faulty software to dodgy paint jobs. Cold weather has prompted complaints about poor battery life.  The company can get over all this if it electrifies Model 3 sales overseas once it starts shipping large volumes to Europe and China. Without that boost, Musk will struggle to demonstrate Tesla\u2019s staying power.","945":"July 22 (Reuters) - Tesla will build its next factory near Austin, Texas, Chief Executive Elon Musk announced late on Wednesday.

The cut is Tesla\u2019s second this week for the high-end sedan, following a 4% cut to $71,990 on Tuesday.

Tesla introduced its Model S in 2012, but in recent years the car has faced competition from the automaker\u2019s less expensive, mass-market Model 3 sedan, launched in 2017, which currently starts at $37,990. The Model S makes up only around 5% of Tesla\u2019s unit volume, said a Credit Suisse analyst in a client note on Wednesday.  The analyst said the Model S price reduction was likely in response to price cuts by electric vehicle startup Lucid Motors, which sells its luxury sedan Air model at a starting price of $69,900. That includes a $7,500 U.S. government electric vehicle tax credit, for which Tesla vehicles are no longer eligible.  The price cuts also come as competition in the electric vehicle market - long dominated by Tesla - heats up, with several automakers launching new electric vehicles next year.  Germany's Daimler AG DAIGn.DE is scheduled to release an electric version of its Mercedes-Benz S-class luxury sedan, the EQS, next year.

His remarks overshadowed an otherwise successful quarter that took many investors by surprise as automaker peers were hit by a slump in consumer demand and forced factory shutdowns.  Shares of the company were up 8.8% at $871 in extended trade.  Tesla's profitable quarter comes just a day after Detroit-based rival Ford Motor Co F.N reported a $2 billion first-quarter loss and forecast losing another $5 billion in the current quarter as the coronavirus pandemic hits demand.  General Motors Co GM.N on Monday suspended its dividend and share buybacks and will report earnings May 6.  How Tesla fares in the current quarter and the remainder of the year will be an important test of the company\u2019s durability. If Tesla can limit its losses, or even continue its profit streak and outperform legacy automakers, it will be in a stronger position to take sales from rivals weakened by the coronavirus disruption.  Tesla produces a fraction of the cars of its rivals but has a much larger stock market value on expectations of tremendous growth.  On the biggest disruptions to Tesla has been the government-ordered shutdown of its factory in Fremont, California, which sits idle since March 24 with stay-at-home orders running until at least May 31.  On a conference call on Wednesday, Musk said he did not know when Tesla could resume production in California and called the state stay-at-home order a \u201cserious risk\u201d to the business.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cTo say that they cannot leave their house and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist. This is not democratic, this is not freedom. Give people back their goddamn freedom!\u201d  Late on Wednesday, the Tesla CEO doubled down on his stance, in response to a journalist\u2019s tweet that quoted Musk\u2019s remarks of calling the stay-at-home orders fascist. \u201cHell yeah!!\u201d, Musk said on Twitter.  Musk tweeted on March 6 that \u201cthe coronavirus panic is dumb\u201d but later offered to supply hospitals with free ventilators.  Tesla said it could not predict how quickly vehicle manufacturing and global supply chains will normalize, saying it would revisit full-year guidance for net income and cash flow when it reports current-quarter results in three months.  Musk said that while other carmakers were cutting back, Telsa was ramping up investment. He said Tesla might announce the location of a new U.S. factory in one to three months.  Tesla in January said it expected positive quarterly cash flow and positive net income going forward. The company on Wednesday did not update its previous forecast of delivering half a million vehicles by the end of 2020.  The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the new coronavirus has disrupted demand for cars, with automakers including Tesla forced to furlough workers and close factories.  Vehicle demand in the United States has dropped as much as 80% in some hard-hit areas in March, but some analysts said sales appeared to recover slightly in April.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Tesla on Wednesday said it expected production at its vehicle factories in Fremont, California and in Shanghai, China to ramp up gradually through the second quarter.  The company said operations at its Shanghai plant were progressing better than expected, with production rates of its Model 3 sedan expected to hit 4,000 units per week, or 200,000 per year, by mid-2020.  Company-wide automotive gross margins in the first quarter jumped to 25.5%.  But of the $5.1 billion in overall automotive revenue, nearly 7% were due to regulatory credits - money Tesla receives from other automakers that buy the company\u2019s carbon emissions credits to meet stricter regulation. Revenue from those credits nearly tripled from the last quarter.  Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Nicholas Hyett also flagged that Tesla\u2019s free cash flow was negative last quarter and improved only modestly on a yearly basis.  \u201cThe immediate future doesn\u2019t look like the ideal time to be selling premium priced cars, so perhaps it\u2019s no surprise guidance has been paused,\u201d Hyett said.  Tesla said its free cash flow had been impacted by growing inventory due to coronavirus shutdowns.  Tesla shut down the California factory just as it was ramping up production of its new electric crossover utility vehicle Model Y, which it expects to generate record demand and higher profit margins.  Tesla on Wednesday said the Model Y was already contributing profits, marking the first time in the company\u2019s history that a new vehicle is profitable in its first quarter.  Excluding items, Tesla posted a profit of $1.24 per share. Analysts had expected a loss of 36 cents per share.  Tesla shares are up 91% for the year to date as of Wednesday\u2019s close, after recovering from a sharp slump in March.  The Tesla CEO in particular appeared critical of the coronavirus-related restrictions in California as he agreed with a tweet suggesting the state\u2019s hospitals were laying off staff and going bankrupt. He also referenced data saying hospitals in California \u201chave been half empty\u201d.  Musk seemed to be supportive of the way the lockdown was being lifted in Germany as the European nation began to gradually and tentatively reopen.  \u201cVery sensible,\u201d Musk tweeted late on Wednesday responding to a media report on how Germany was lifting its restrictions.","949":"Jan 22 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Wednesday crossed $100 billion in market valuation for the first time, further extending its lead over Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co.  The electric-car maker has seen its stock more than double in the last three months, fueled by a rare quarterly profit in October, news of production ramp-up in its China factory and better-than-expected annual car deliveries.  Shares of the company were up 3.7% at $567.5 in early trading.

Total deliveries came in at a record 97,000 units for the quarter, but was below analysts\u2019 estimates of 97,477 vehicles, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The company, led by billionaire Elon Musk, is under pressure to ramp up production, while proving that there is sustainable demand for its vehicles and that it can turn a profit, even as traditional luxury car makers begin to roll out their own electric models.  The company has set a target to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles in 2019, which means that it needs to deliver at least 104,800 vehicles in its final quarter to meet the low end of its full-year forecast.  \u201cLooks like the 360k bottom end of 2019 forecast is starting to look a bit iffy,\u201d Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin said.  The company\u2019s Model S and X vehicles are also facing challenges from the recently launched all-electric SUVs from Audi and Jaguar Land Rover.  Deliveries of the two high-priced models fell 1.4% to 17,400 from the second quarter and came in below analysts\u2019 estimates of 18,829 vehicles.  The company also delivered 79,600 Model 3 sedans in the third quarter, beating estimates of 79,470, but the pace of growth was just 2.6% from the previous quarter.  The Model 3 is the linchpin of Tesla\u2019s growth strategy and Musk is under pressure to deliver the vehicle to new international markets efficiently, while guarding working capital.

REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  Tesla said its orders in the third quarter exceeded deliveries and that it was therefore entering the fourth quarter with a backlog.  CHINA FACTOR  China is emerging as a major market for Tesla and the company plans to start production this month at its new Shanghai plant.  The California-based company is aiming to produce at least 1,000 Model 3s a week from the factory by the end of this year, the centerpiece of its ambitions to boost sales in the world\u2019s biggest auto market and avoid higher import tariffs imposed on U.S. cars.  The plant\u2019s mass production schedule is crucial for Tesla\u2019s hopes of reaching its total production rate at an annualized 500,000 vehicles by the end of this year.  It was, however, unclear when it would meet its year-end production targets due to uncertainties around orders, labor and suppliers, according to a Reuters report.  As the company strives to improve margins and post profit for the second half of 2019, Musk has been trying to cut spending.  Musk had previously said that Tesla aims to be profitable in the fourth quarter, with the third quarter to be break-even. The company said it was focusing less on profit and more on volume growth, capacity expansion and cash generation.  Under pressure to meet his repeated promises to make Tesla sustainably profitable, Musk is trying to contain costs while still spending on major initiatives from a Shanghai factory and assembly-line to upcoming models such as the Model Y SUV and a Semi commercial truck.  Tesla also announced that it had entered into a debt facility agreement of up to 5 billion yuan ($700 million) to finance vehicles-in-transit to China.  Separately, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Wednesday that U.S. regulators are looking into parking lot crashes involving Tesla cars driving themselves to their owners using the company\u2019s Smart Summon feature.

But in China, the world\u2019s biggest electric vehicle market where Tesla is gearing up for a major sales push, that tune has started to change as the automaker promotes racing events, showroom parties with DJs and a line of Chinese Tesla stickers for chat apps.  Case in point: Wang Yubo, a 30-year-old marketing executive and Tesla car owner, was invited by the company to burnish his driving skills at a Shanghai racing track this month.  \u201cI learned how to push my Model 3 to its limits,\u201d said Wang, who writes both enthusiastic and critical blogs about Tesla and occasionally races his car with friends.  Tesla is expanding its focus beyond products to service, says Leo Liu, head of the company\u2019s China driving school which aims to teach people \u201cto make full use of their cars\u201d.  It held three such events for auto reporters, social media influencers and a handful of owners in August - one in Beijing and two in Shanghai and plans to expand to other big cities such as Guangzhou and Chengdu.  \u201cWe are also thinking of having more difficult ones on ice tracks in winter this year,\u201d Liu said, adding that more owners will be invited in the future.  While Tesla hasn\u2019t embarked on conventional TV or billboard advertising, the U.S. firm\u2019s China Chief Tom Zhu has been working on strategies this year to boost the brand\u2019s appeal, frequently seeking ideas and opinions from marketing and sales experts, sources familiar with the discussions said.  The sources were not authorised to speak to the media and declined to be identified. Tesla declined to comment.  BIG FACTORY, BIG PLANS  Helping raise his profile in China, Musk is currently visiting the country and on Thursday held a discussion with Alibaba\u2019s Jack Ma at an AI industry event, although they avoided controversial issues like the U.S.-China trade war.  Tesla\u2019s new efforts to reach customers in China come as the Silicon Valley automaker is preparing to open a big vehicle assembly factory in Shanghai and confront fierce competition in the luxury electric vehicle market it invented.  The firm\u2019s first overseas factory is due to start production by the end of the year and Tesla has said it should be able to build 3,000 Model 3 vehicles a week in its initial phases.  That would translate to nearly four times the number of imported Model 3 vehicles sold in China per month this year, according to figures from research firm LMC Automotive.  The plant is slated to have annual output capacity of 250,000 vehicles after production of the Model Y is added.  \u201cWe have to learn how to manage a larger sales and after-sales system as production is growing to a completely different level,\u201d said one source. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are doing these events now.\u201d  The sources added, however, that Tesla is spending far less than what a conventional carmaker in China would be spending on marketing.  In Tesla\u2019s favour, it has been exporting cars to China since 2014 and remains the benchmark that other automakers in China often compare their electric vehicles to when they advertise.  The launch of the Model 3 for the Chinese market in late February has also gone well, sending Tesla\u2019s China revenue jumping 42% to $1.5 billion in the first half - equivalent to 13.5% of total revenue.  But Tesla in China doesn\u2019t have the headstart in all-electric vehicles that it had in the U.S. market when it debuted the Model S in 2012.  Chinese startup Nio Inc sells two premium all-electric SUVs, Jaguar has launched is I-PACE SUV and BMW has its i3 hatchback and i8 sportscar. By the end of the year, Audi will have two all-electric SUVs on the market while Daimler\u2019s Mercedes will have one.  The U.S firm also doesn\u2019t expect Musk\u2019s cult status to propel sales to the same extent it does elsewhere, the sources said.  Most Chinese do not have easy access to his Twitter feed followed by nearly 28 million, although Tesla translates some of his less controversial tweets on its Weibo account.  In addition to chat app stickers that express various emotions - a market strategy also used by other automakers - Tesla is partnering with Tencent\u2019s QQ Music streaming service in organising parties with DJs at showrooms.  Both marketing tactics are China-only developments, the sources said.  Social media users have noticed much more activity on Tesla\u2019s Weibo account in recent months while company has also held several roundtables with reporters and internet influencers throughout China since July.  According to sources, executives explained pricing strategy and expansion plans for its charging network and said they wanted to improve communication with the public.  By contrast, in the United States Tesla rarely grants media access to its executives beyond earnings calls and product launches.  \u201cTesla has finally realised the importance of adjusting to China,\u201d said Wang. \u201cGiven time, it will become more mature.\u201d (Reporting by Yilei Sun in Shanghai and Alexandria Sage in San Francisco; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)","958":"(Reuters) - Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk did not admit liability in this weekend\u2019s $20 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. But lawyers for shareholders suing Tesla in for securities fraud said the SEC\u2019s case against Musk and his company will help the private litigation in at least two ways.  The most important boost comes from the SEC\u2019s Sept. 27 complaint, which contains detailed allegations about the agency\u2019s investigation of Musk\u2019s Aug. 7 claim to have secured financing for a deal to take Tesla private at $420 per share.  Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast  The SEC complaint detailed Musk\u2019s own account of a crucial meeting with a sovereign wealth fund that was allegedly the basis of his tweet floating the go-private deal. The SEC also outlined Musk\u2019s communications with Tesla board members about the meeting and recounted some of the reaction within the company to Musk\u2019s tweet. According to the SEC, that evidence showed Musk\u2019s tweets about the go-private deal \u201cwere premised on a long series of baseless assumptions and were contrary to facts that Musk knew.\u201d  Shareholders\u2019 lawyers say investors can incorporate the SEC\u2019s factual allegations in the private litigation. Plaintiffs in securities class actions are not permitted to obtain discovery from defendants until their cases have survived initial defense dismissal motions. The SEC, however, was able to get crucial evidence, including testimony from Musk. Because the agency made that evidence public in its complaint, class action lawyers can now make use of it.  That evidence increases the likelihood that the private class action will survive any attempt by Tesla to end the litigation quickly, according to shareholders\u2019 lawyers Reed Kathrein of Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, Francis McConville of Labaton Sucharow and Travis Lenkner of Keller Lenkner. Kathrein, McConville and Lenkner all represent shareholders who have sued Tesla for securities fraud in San Francisco federal court.  \u201cWe can plead the facts in the SEC complaint that we didn\u2019t have,\u201d Kathrein said. \u201cThat can get us past Tesla\u2019s motion to dismiss.\u201d  McConville said there have been previous cases in which judges have allowed shareholders\u2019 lawyers in private cases to incorporate facts from regulators\u2019 complaints. He cited, for example, a class action in Manhattan federal court alleging that Barclays secretly favored high frequency traders. The bank argued that shareholders could not rely on allegations developed by the New York attorney general, but U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin rejected that argument in a 2015 opinion (105 F.Supp.3d 330).  Tesla is represented in the private securities litigation by Fenwick & West. I emailed Fenwick lawyers Dean Kristy and Jennifer Bretan to ask about shareholders\u2019 lawyers\u2019 take on the consequences of the SEC case but didn\u2019t hear back. The company and Musk are permitted, under the SEC settlement, to deny liability in the private shareholder litigation. Tesla will almost certainly argue that investors cannot prove Musk intended to deceive them in his Aug. 7 tweets and that he had a reasonable basis to believe he was being truthful.  The second potentially significant consequence of the SEC\u2019s case, according to shareholders\u2019 lawyers, is that the settlement could nudge hedge funds off the sidelines and into leadership of the investor class action.  Several investors have already filed prospective class actions against Tesla and its board members. Those cases are being overseen by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of San Francisco. Under the statutory rules for securities class actions, investors who want to be named to lead the consolidated case must file notice by Oct. 9.  So far, mostly small Tesla investors have surfaced. Only one well-known investor, activist shortseller Andrew Left of Citron Research, has filed a suit and staked a claim to lead the case. That\u2019s not a big surprise. Hedge funds like those that held big short positions in Tesla stock are historically reluctant to initiate shareholder class actions.  But the SEC settlement could change the calculation for institutional Tesla investors, according to shareholders\u2019 lawyers. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to be an instigator,\u201d said Lenkner. \u201cThere\u2019s a different public profile if you\u2019re acting after a government regulator has already said there\u2019s misconduct and reached a settlement.\u201d  Hedge funds may even have a fiduciary responsibility to step up to lead the investor class action, Lenkner said. Assuming the case survives Tesla\u2019s dismissal motions, damages calculations will be shaped, according to Lenkner and Kathrein, by how the lead investor and its lawyers define shareholder losses and frame the time period of the alleged fraud.  \u201cThe ability to control the case from the beginning is important,\u201d Lenkner said. \u201cWhen you have a government settlement and these alleged facts, that starts to move the needle toward \u2018This is something you must do\u2019 rather than \u2018This is something you should do.\u2019\u201d  Kathrein agreed: \u201cNow you don\u2019t look like an angry investor,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at, what should you do to protect your client base.\u201d  All three plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers said they are talking to investors with large Tesla stakes about the prospect of stepping up to lead the case. (Shareholders do not have to file their own lawsuits at this point but can simply file a motion to serve as the lead investor in the cases already before Judge Chen.) They\u2019re anticipating a lot of action in the Tesla docket before that Oct. 9 deadline.  \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 10 years,\u201d said McConville. \u201cThis is by far the most newsworthy, buzzworthy case we\u2019ve been involved with.\u201d","959":"FRANKFURT\/DETROIT (Reuters) - Robots are not efficient enough for Tesla\u2019s new car factory in Germany, which plans to replace hundreds of them with giant aluminium casting machines to build simpler chassis parts, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.  FILE PHOTO: Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk attends an opening ceremony for Tesla China-made Model Y program in Shanghai, China January 7, 2020. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  The electric carmaker has struggled to raise production volumes through hi-tech automation and was forced to fly in a new production line from Germany to Nevada in 2018 after robots failed to coordinate seamlessly at the U.S. factory.  For the new Model Y, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has said he will replace 70 components glued and riveted into the car\u2019s rear underbody with a single module made using an aluminium casting machine.  That\u2019s just the start of a new automation drive, with the vehicle\u2019s front module and other parts to come, the source said.  \u201cWill be amazing to see it in operation! Biggest casting machine ever made. Will make rear body in a single piece, including crash rails,\u201d Musk said on Twitter on Aug. 13. He did not say where or when the new machine would be rolled out.  Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.  Tesmanian, a blog specialising in Tesla news, said on Monday the company\u2019s new plant in Brandenburg, near Berlin, would be supplied with eight \u201cGigapress\u201d machines.  Car bodies have traditionally been made by assembling multiple stamped metal panels, which has helped carmakers to design crumple zones to absorb energy during a crash, but Musk is charting a new course at the Brandenburg plant.  \u201cHe wants the car\u2019s body to be made from modules, as few of them as possible,\u201d the source explained. \u201cHe sees casting as the new way forward. Like casting a toy car out of metal.\u201d  The Gigapress, which is the size of a small house, will be supplied by Italy\u2019s IDRA Srl, and forms a key part of Musk\u2019s drive to reinvent \u201cthe machine that builds the machine,\u201d the source added.  IDRA declined to comment. IDRA has previously said it has supplied its first ever Gigapress to a North American auto manufacturer, without naming it.  Musk\u2019s push to reduce manufacturing complexity comes as German carmakers BMW, Mercedes and Audi face pressure from their workers to preserve domestic assembly jobs which are under threat as regulators push electric cars that have fewer components than combustion-engined ones.  Aluminium has proven cumbersome to use in large components because it is difficult to stamp into complex shapes. To get intricate ridges and other shapes, aluminium pieces have needed to be glued or riveted, since welding deforms the metal.  Injecting molten aluminium into a cast and having robots pull out the moulded metal allows Tesla to combine several manufacturing steps.  Sandy Munro, chief executive officer of manufacturing consulting firm Munro & Associates and a previous critic of some of Tesla\u2019s manufacturing processes, lauded its improvements.  \u201cWe were very critical of Tesla when we first started on their vehicles. The gaps were horrific, the weld spatter was everywhere. Nothing fit,\u201d Munro said during a recent presentation with consultants Frost & Sullivan. But the switch from the Model 3 to a larger vehicle, the Model Y, resulted in a step change in manufacturing improvements, he said.  Tesla has already reduced the rear underbody to two parts, forming the largest piece of aluminium that Munro has seen in 30 years of analysing components. \u201cThis is the biggest casting we have seen in a car company. This is just spectacular,\u201d he said.","960":"FILE PHOTO: A Tesla logo is seen at a groundbreaking ceremony of Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory in Shanghai, China January 7, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Shares of Tesla Inc TSLA.O fell as much as 14% on Thursday on concerns about the impact of the coronavirus on the electric-car maker's vehicle registrations in China.  Data from LMC Automotive showed that 3,563 Tesla vehicles were registered in China in January, up from 853 vehicles a year earlier, but down from the 6,613 vehicles registered in December.  Tesla registrations fluctuate significantly from month to month, LMC data showed. The automaker typically delivers many more vehicles in the final month of a quarter than in the first month. In October 2019, Tesla owners registered just 763 vehicles, LMC data showed.  Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.  The selloff in Tesla shares highlights the growing concern about the health of the Chinese auto market as the government and companies contend with the disruption of the coronavirus outbreak.  China Association of Automobile Manufacturers had earlier said here that overall vehicle sales fell by almost a fifth in January, hurt by Lunar New Year holidays that started earlier than last year and by the coronavirus disruptions.  The electric-car maker said here earlier this month that the outbreak would delay deliveries of its Model 3 cars in China.  While the virus originated in China\u2019s Wuhan province late last year, local governments began imposing travel curbs and warning residents to avoid public spaces in the last two weeks of January.  Tesla shares were trading down at $685 and were set for their fourth consecutive session of losses.

FILE PHOTO: Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk talks at the Automotive World News Congress at the Renaissance Center in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 13, 2015. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook\/File Photo  Last month, Musk took to Twitter to announce that he was considering taking Tesla private for $420 per share and had secured funding. On Thursday, the SEC in a lawsuit outlined a detailed timeline of events leading to Musk\u2019s going-private tweet and its aftermath, as follows.  ** January 2017 - The SEC noted that Musk began a series of three or four in-person meetings with representatives of a sovereign investment fund. Reuters later identified the fund as Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund.  During these meetings, according to Musk, the lead representative of the fund verbally expressed interest in making a large investment in Tesla and establish a production facility in the Middle East, the SEC said.  ** July 31, 2018 - In the first meeting in months, lasting 30-45 minutes, the fund\u2019s lead representative told Musk that the fund had recently bought almost five percent of Tesla\u2019s stock, expressed interest in taking Tesla private and confirmed that he was empowered to make investment decisions for the fund.  -- Musk later stated that he assumed without confirming that the lead fund representative was proposing a \u201cstandard\u201d going-private transaction, but acknowledged that the terms of any such deal were not discussed. Nothing was exchanged in writing, and there was no discussion of confidentiality, the SEC said.  -- The SEC said the meeting lacked discussion of even the most fundamental terms of a proposed going-private transaction. There was no discussion of any dollar amount or specific ownership percentage, acquisition premium to be offered to Tesla shareholders, restrictions on foreign ownership, regulatory hurdles, or board approval process.  ** August 2 - After the U.S. market closed, Musk sent an email with the subject, \u201cOffer to Take Tesla Private at $420,\u201d to Tesla\u2019s board, chief financial officer, and general counsel.  -- Musk explained his reasons for wanting to take Tesla private, including that being public \u201c[s]ubjects Tesla to constant defamatory attacks by the short-selling community, resulting in great harm to our valuable brand.\u201d  -- The SEC said that according to Musk, he had calculated the $420 price per share based on a 20 percent premium over that day\u2019s closing share price, because he thought 20 percent was a \u201cstandard premium\u201d in going-private transactions.  Musk picked $420 because he had recently learned about the number\u2019s significance in marijuana culture and thought his girlfriend \u201cwould find it funny, which admittedly is not a great reason to pick a price,\u201d Musk said in his email to the board, the SEC noted.  -- Before Musk\u2019s July 31 meeting with the sovereign investment fund, Tesla\u2019s stock had closed at about $298 per share and a 20 percent premium over that price would have indicated a price of about $358, the SEC noted in its lawsuit.  ** Aug. 3: In response to Musk\u2019s email, Tesla\u2019s board had a telephone meeting, where Musk told board members that he wanted existing investors to stay with the company. At least one board member told Musk that it would be \u201creally difficult for small investors\u201d to remain shareholders in private Tesla, the SEC quoted Musk as saying.  ** Aug. 6 - Musk discussed a potential going-private transaction with a private-equity fund partner with previous experience in such deals. He told the partner that the number of Tesla shareholders needed to execute the transaction would be below 300. At the time, Tesla had over 800 institutional shareholders and many more individual investors, the SEC noted, adding that according to the partner, the transaction structure that Musk was contemplating was \u201cunprecedented.\u201d  ** Aug. 7 - Musk tweeted at about 1248 ET, during market hours: \u201cAm considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\u201d  -- He went on to post several Twitter posts and engaged with other Twitter users regarding his go-private plans. He did not notify Nasdaq prior to publishing his tweets, as required by the stock exchange\u2019s rules.  -- At this point, the SEC noted, Musk had not made several necessary checks, including not having further discussion with the sovereign fund, providing the board more details, or contacting existing Tesla shareholders to assess their interest in remaining invested in Tesla as a private company.  -- Twelve minutes after Musk\u2019s first tweet, Tesla\u2019s head of investor relations sent a text to Musk\u2019s chief of staff asking: \u201cWas this text legit?\u201d  -- About 35 minutes after Musk\u2019s initial tweet, Tesla CFO Deepak Ahuja sent him a text message, \u201cElon, am sure you have thought about a broader communication on your rationale and structure to employees and potential investors. Would it help if [Tesla\u2019s head of communications], [Tesla\u2019s General Counsel], and I draft a blog post or employee email for you?\u201d  Musk responded, \u201cYeah, that would be great.\u201d  -- Tesla shares closed up nearly 11 percent on Aug. 7.  ** Aug. 10 - Three days after his tweet, Musk contacted the sovereign wealth fund for the first time since their July 31 meeting, the SEC said.  ** Aug. 13 - Tesla published a blog post attributed to Musk called \u201cUpdate on Taking Tesla Private\u201d.  In the post, Musk attempted to walk back his Aug. 7 tweets, saying when he first tweeted his intention, it was based on his impression that there was \u201cno question\u201d that a deal with the sovereign fund could be closed and that it was \u201cjust a matter of getting the process moving.\u201d  ** Aug. 24 - Post published on Tesla\u2019s public blog announced that Musk had abandoned the process of attempting to take Tesla private.  ** September 27 - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Musk for fraud and sought to remove him from Tesla.  -- Up to Thursday\u2019s close, Tesla shares had fallen about 10 percent since Aug. 6.","964":"SHANGHAI, July 10 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Tuesday signed agreements with Shanghai authorities that will allow it to open a plant in the Chinese city with an annual capacity of 500,000 cars, local media reported.

The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which issued the statement, and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating a fatal crash in March in which the driver was using Autopilot.  Following that fatality, Tesla pointed to a 2017 NHTSA report on a May 2016 fatality involving a driver using Autopilot. The report said crash rates fell by 40 percent after installation of Autopilot\u2019s Autosteer function, and noted that this number was derived from Tesla airbag deployment data.  The agency said on Wednesday its crash rate comparison \u201cdid not evaluate whether Autosteer was engaged\u201d and \u201cdid not assess the effectiveness of this technology.\u201d  The agency described the Autopilot analysis in the 2017 report as a \u201ccursory comparison\u201d of airbag deployment rates before and after installation of the feature to determine whether models with Autosteer had higher crash rates. Such a finding \u201ccould have indicated that further investigation was necessary,\u201d the agency said.  Tesla declined to comment.  In March, Tesla said that over a year ago, the U.S. government found that its first iteration of Autopilot reduced crash rates by as much as 40 percent. \u201cInternal data confirms that recent updates to Autopilot have improved system reliability,\u201d it added.  On Jan. 19, 2017, Musk tweeted: \u201cThe data show that the Tesla vehicles crash rate dropped by almost 40 percent after Autosteer installation.\u201d Autosteer, a system that automatically keeps the vehicle in the center of a lane, is part of the Autopilot technology package.  The 2017 NHTSA probe found no evidence of a defect. Investigations into the death of Walter Huang, the driver in the March 23 Tesla car crash, are ongoing.  The NTSB confirmed last month it had two other pending investigations of incidents involving Tesla vehicles, including an August 2017 Tesla battery fire in Lake Forest, California, after an owner lost control and ran the vehicle into his garage.  The NTSB previously faulted Tesla in a 2016 fatal crash in Florida in which Autopilot was engaged.

A man is seen next to Panasonic Corp's logo at Panasonic Center in Tokyo, Japan, February 2, 2017. REUTERS\/Kim Kyung-Hoon  Business with Tesla has yet to contribute to profit. Yet Panasonic said it was in talks to add to its $1.6 billion investment and take capacity at the so-called Gigafactory over the 35 Gigawatt hours (GWh) it is set to reach by March-end.  Panasonic is the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla cars. As production of the automaker\u2019s mass-market Model 3 accelerated in the July-September quarter, Panasonic had to send more engineers and spend more to increase cell production.  The higher costs, as well as slower demand for factory automation equipment in China amid an escalating Sino-U.S. trade war, pushed Panasonic\u2019s July-September operating profit down 15 percent to 95.2 billion yen ($840.92 million).  The result compared with the 112.60 billion yen average of 7 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.  Last week, Tesla reported a net profit, positive cash flow and wider-than-expected margins for the quarter. The automaker is averaging roughly 4,300 Model 3s a week which, though below its 5,000 target set for June, was enough to boost earnings.  The Model 3 was the best-selling car in the United States in terms of revenue in July-September, and fifth best-selling car in terms of volume, Tesla said.  Asked about any intention to invest in Tesla\u2019s planned plant in China, Panasonic Chief Executive Kazuhiro Tsuga at an earnings briefing on Wednesday said the firm \u201cwill put priority on building additional capacity at the Gigafactory over China\u201d.  Tsuga said Panasonic has been discussing details of the capacity hike plan with Tesla, but declined to comment further.  \u201cInvestment for capacity beyond 35 GWh means that Tesla would also need to make substantial investment in vehicle production, so we will closely align with each other,\u201d he said.

FILE PHOTO: Flags fly over the Tesla Inc. Gigafactory 2, which is also known as RiverBend, a joint venture with Panasonic to produce solar panels and roof tiles in Buffalo, New York, U.S., August 2, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Effective on Thursday, price quotes for potential solar customers will be between $3,000 and $5,000 lower, representing savings of about 15 to 25 percent, according to Sanjay Shah, the company\u2019s senior vice president of energy operations.  Tesla said the $3,000 to $5,000 in savings was an average and that the actual amount could be lower or higher depending on the size of the rooftop system and where a home is located.  Since Tesla\u2019s acquisition two years ago of SolarCity, which at the time was the largest U.S. residential solar company, the company has sharply cut the vast sales organization that underpinned its rapid growth.  Last year, Tesla stopped selling solar door-to-door, and earlier this year it ended a long-standing deal to sell solar at 800 Home Depot Inc HD.N stores - a relationship that some analysts estimated brought in roughly half of Tesla's solar sales but added up to $7,000 to the cost of a residential system.  That has come alongside a big drop in installations. Tesla deployed just 93 megawatts of solar in the third quarter, down from SolarCity\u2019s more than 200 MW a quarter in early 2016.  Shah said that with lower prices, customers will seek out Tesla at its stores and online.  \u201cEvery customer wants a greater value in terms of price,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you do that the customer comes to you rather than you going to the customer.\u201d  He said the price cuts should make Tesla \u201chighly competitive\u201d and added that the company ultimately wants to be the lowest-cost solar provider in the United States.  Solar energy systems from large installers on average are about 10 percent more expensive than those sold by smaller companies, according to a 2017 report by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a U.S. government research lab.  Shah said Tesla\u2019s premium solar products are more efficient than most other panels, and should not be compared with standard systems on price.  The price cuts are made possible in part by the savings Tesla has produced from streamlining its sales operations. By selling directly through its website and roughly 100 retail stores, Tesla has been able to cut sales and marketing costs in half, Shah said.  Shah joined the company six months ago from Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and has focused on making its solar supply chain more efficient, reducing sales and marketing costs, and bringing down the time it takes for rooftop systems to be installed, he said.  Tesla shares closed 1.3 percent higher at $348.44 on the Nasdaq on Thursday.","980":"A parking lot of predominantly new Tesla Model 3 electric vehicles is seen in Richmond, California, U.S. June 22, 2018.

Tesla shares closed up 2.8 percent at $291.72 on Wednesday after the report.  The Model 3 sedan is seen as crucial to Tesla\u2019s profitability at a time when it is battling to reverse production shortfalls, confronting reports of crashes involving its vehicles and facing increased skepticism over its finances.  The update improved the Model 3\u2019s overall score enough for a recommendation, said Consumer Reports, which had also raised other concerns such as the car\u2019s wind noise, stiff ride and uncomfortable rear seat.  \"Really appreciate the high quality critical feedback from @ConsumerReports. Road noise & ride comfort already addressed too. UI improvements coming via remote software update later this month,\" Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said in a tweet here in response to the report.  During the retest, Consumer Reports found that Model 3 stopped at 133 feet from 60 mph, matching Tesla\u2019s earlier claims on the car\u2019s braking distance.  Musk had acknowledged the brake issue last week, saying that the magazine\u2019s tests had used two early versions of the car and that a firmware update could improve braking distance beyond initial specs.  Jake Fisher, director of automotive testing at Consumer Reports, said he had never seen a car that could improve its track performance with an over-the-air update in his 19-year career at the magazine.  Fisher, however, said the car controls are \u201ca bit distracting and cumbersome\u201d to use, with too many steps on screen to do routine functions.  \u201cI don\u2019t think this will ever be a very highly rated control system just because there are so few hard buttons or controls,\u201d he told Reuters.  Fisher remained hopeful Tesla will bring changes to improve Model 3\u2019s user experience, and said the company may consider a traditional transponder key in addition to the car\u2019s keyless system.  Consumer Reports said it would test another Model 3, after Musk told the magazine that the electric car maker had already made changes to address the three other issues flagged in its initial report.","982":"FILE PHOTO: A Tesla charging station is seen in Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S. on September 28, 2017.

The recommendations by the top proxy adviser echo those made earlier this week by rival Glass Lewis, although ISS did side with Tesla and recommend investors vote for Musk\u2019s brother and current director Kimbal Musk.  Union-affiliated activist CtW Investment Group has criticized the three Tesla directors up for election this year as being too close to Elon Musk or unqualified.  In its report, ISS wrote that Gracias, CEO of Valor Management Corp, is not sufficiently independent for key board committees. It also cited concerns regarding the lack of performance-based elements in Tesla\u2019s pay plan in recommending the vote against Gracias, a compensation committee member.  ISS wrote that Murdoch is \"overboarded\" since he serves as the CEO of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOXA.O and on other boards.  A Tesla director not up for election this year because of the board\u2019s staggered election schedule is Steve Jurvetson. He has been on leave from Tesla\u2019s board since November when he also resigned from venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ) amid an internal DFJ probe into sexual harassment allegations made against him, which he denied.

Autopilot, a form of advanced cruise control, handles some driving tasks and warns those behind the wheel they are always responsible for the vehicle\u2019s safe operation, Tesla has said.  In a Twitter post on Monday, Musk denied a Wall Street Journal report that Tesla had rejected a system that would have tracked driver eye movement when using Autopilot for cost reasons.  \u201cThis is false,\u201d Musk wrote. \u201cEyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg,\u201d Musk said. He said Tesla\u2019s record of a fatality every 320 million miles compared with last year\u2019s national average of 86 million miles, per safety regulators.  Tesla\u2019s record of miles driven could not be confirmed by Reuters.  In another Twitter message on Monday, Musk said the \u201cprobability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla,\u201d saying Tesla would begin reporting safety numbers beginning in the second quarter.  On Monday, firefighters in Switzerland said a fatal accident involving a Tesla may have set off a fire in the car\u2019s battery. [L5N1SL7R8] It was the latest accident involving a Tesla.  A Tesla Model S sedan was traveling at 60 miles (97 km) per hour when it smashed into a fire truck stopped at a red light about 20 miles south of Salt Lake City, Utah, on Friday night, according to police. [L3N1SL52C]  Police said on Monday that the driver, who suffered a broken ankle, said she had been using Autopilot before the crash.  The National Transportation Safety Board said it was not investigating the Utah crash.  Tesla said it had not yet received car data and did not yet know the facts, including whether Autopilot was engaged.  The NTSB said last week it was investigating a Tesla accident in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on May 8 that killed two teenagers and injured another - the agency\u2019s fourth active probe into crashes of the company\u2019s electric vehicles.","989":"SAN FRANCISCO\/BOSTON (Reuters) - Shareholders of electric car company Tesla Inc approved a compensation package potentially worth $2.6 billion for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk on Wednesday, though by a lower margin than U.S. CEOs typically receive on pay votes.  Elon Musk speaks at a press conference following the first launch of a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S., February 6, 2018. REUTERS\/Joe Skipper  Excluding votes by Musk and his brother Kimbal, the measure passed with about 73 percent of votes cast. Including the Musk votes, the award passed with about 80 percent support, Tesla said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.  The compensation award includes no salary or cash bonus for the Silicon Valley billionaire, but sets rewards based on Tesla\u2019s market value rising to as much as $650 billion over the next 10 years.  The vote result indicated some, but not all big investors were prepared to support a large payout at the founder-led company. If achieved, the award surpasses anything previously granted to top U.S. executives, according to proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services, which had recommended votes against the compensation.  Musk could own as much as $55.8 billion in Tesla stock and more than a quarter of the electric car company in the next decade if he hits all targets of the new plan.  \u201cAt $2.6 billion, the grant value is unprecedented and sets the new high-water mark for an individual executive equity award at a U.S. public company,\u201d ISS wrote last month. ISS said it valued the award even higher, at $3.7 billion.  Shares of Tesla are down 18 percent from a year high reached in September. The company has faced pressure on multiple fronts, from a cash crunch and production delays to increasing competition from rivals. Some investors are concerned that Musk is distracted by too many projects including his SpaceX rocket launches.  Compensation for the CEOs of large U.S. companies is typically approved by around 95 percent of votes cast in annual \u201csay on pay\u201d advisory votes. Musk\u2019s potentially huge payout meant extra scrutiny. The vote total was 63,014,339 \u201cfor\u201d votes and 23,407,632 against.  John Trentacoste, partner at pay consultant Farient Advisors, said the 73 percent support level shows \u201cthere is support, but skepticism\u201d among investors for Musk\u2019s pay plan.  Noting the 95 percent typical support level for CEO pay, he said Musk\u2019s big payout has been roundly criticized. Ultimately the result, he said, \u201cis not great comparatively, but for the amount of fodder that\u2019s been around on this pay plan, I think it could be worse.\u201d  Ahead of the vote tally, compensation consultant Brent Longnecker said any result above 70 percent would prompt Tesla to \u201cbreathe a sigh of relief.\u201d  SOME OPPOSITION  Before Tesla began a special shareholder meeting on Wednesday, a spokesman for T. Rowe Price Group, Tesla\u2019s fourth-largest investor with about 6 percent of its shares, told Reuters Musk\u2019s pay plan \u201cis well aligned with shareholders\u2019 long-term interests.\u201d But a smaller investor, the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System (CalSTRS), said it planned to vote no.  CalSTRS is one of the nation\u2019s largest public pension plans but only the 59th largest investor in Tesla, with a 0.13 percent stake.  \u201cGiven the size of the award, we believe the potential dilution to shareholders is just too great. In addition, we have concerns about the lack of focus on profitability for the company, and the one profitability metric that is used excludes the cost of stock-based compensation,\u201d CalSTRS\u2019 Director of Corporate Governance, Anne Sheehan, said in a statement.  Under the proposed award, which involves stock options that vest in 12 tranches, Tesla\u2019s market value must increase to $100 billion for the first tranche to vest and rise in additional $50 billion increments for the remainder.  Tesla was valued at about $53.47 billion at Wednesday\u2019s close, according to Thomson Reuters data. Its shares had fallen nearly 12 percent since the pay plan was announced, but rose 2 percent on Wednesday to close at $316.53.  Tesla has been struggling to manufacture its Model 3 sedan - for which it holds about 500,000 advance reservations - and has repeatedly pushed back production timelines.  The company has been burning through cash and expects spending to rise this year, even as a host of upcoming projects demand attention and capital, including the new Tesla Semi and the Model Y crossover.  A wave of electric vehicles on the horizon from rivals are also adding pressure. Global automakers from Ford Motor Co to Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE are cumulatively investing $90 billion in electrification over the next five years, with luxury models from Audi and Tata Motors Ltd's Jaguar due this summer.","990":"NEW YORK\/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Tesla Inc TSLA.O Chief Executive Elon Musk on Thursday of fraud and sought to remove him from his role in charge of the electric car company, saying he made a series of \"false and misleading\" tweets about potentially taking Tesla private last month.  In a lawsuit, the regulator described Musk surprising members of his own team and investors with a series of tweets, starting with the Aug. 7 announcement that he was thinking of taking Tesla private. Twelve minutes after the first tweet, Tesla\u2019s head of investor relations texted Musk\u2019s chief of staff to ask whether Musk\u2019s announcement was \u201clegit\u201d, the SEC said.  Musk, 47, is the public face of Tesla and losing him would be a big blow for the money-losing car maker which has a market value of more than $50 billion, chiefly because of investors\u2019 belief in Musk\u2019s leadership.  The Department of Justice, which has the authority to press criminal charges, has also questioned the company about Musk\u2019s tweets, the company said this month.  Tesla shares tumbled 12 percent in after-hours trading.  \u201cElon is Tesla and Tesla is Elon and that\u2019s great when Elon is scoring touchdowns and grand slams but not so great when there are negative things tied to him,\u201d said Karl Brauer, executive publisher at car research firm Kelley Blue Book.  Musk said he had done nothing wrong. \u201cThis unjustified action by the SEC leaves me deeply saddened and disappointed,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIntegrity is the most important value in my life and the facts will show I never compromised this in any way.\u201d  Tesla\u2019s board said they are \u201cfully confident\u201d in Musk.  The SEC\u2019s lawsuit, filed in Manhattan federal court, caps a tumultuous two months set in motion on Aug. 7 when Musk told his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take Tesla private at $420 per share, with \u201cfunding secured\u201d.  On Aug. 24, after news of the SEC probe had become known, Musk blogged here that Tesla would remain public, citing investor resistance.  The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that the SEC filed the lawsuit after a proposed settlement with Musk fell apart. The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Thursday.  In its lawsuit, the SEC said Musk calculated the $420 price per share based on a 20 percent premium over that day\u2019s closing share price and because of the number\u2019s slang reference to marijuana. The lawsuit, which cites emails and text messages between Musk and Tesla executives, quoted Musk as saying he thought his girlfriend \u201cwould find it funny, which admittedly is not a great reason to pick a price\u201d.  After the initial tweet, Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer asked Musk \u201cwould it help\u201d if executives drafted a blog post or employee email to explain his tweet. Musk responded, \u201cYeah, that would be great.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk reveals the Tesla Energy Powerwall Home Battery during an event in Hawthorne, California, U.S., April 30, 2015. REUTERS\/Patrick T. Fallon\/File Photo  Musk had not discussed the $420 figure with any potential funding source before he broached the subject to Tesla\u2019s board in an Aug. 2 email, the SEC said.  The SEC said its investigation into Tesla is ongoing.  The move to bar Musk as an officer of any public company was a rare move for the SEC against the CEO of such a well-known firm.  \u201cThe lesson for CEOs is that the rules apply to everyone including highly successful visionaries,\u201d said Charles Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.  Teresa Goody, CEO of law firm Goody Counsel and a former SEC attorney, said the SEC had acted quickly but that most such SEC lawsuits are usually settled without going to a jury trial. Settlements can take some time to reach if the defendant is unwilling to budge on the SEC\u2019s key demands.  RECKLESSNESS?  The SEC lawsuit comes as Tesla has been struggling to deliver its new Model 3 sedan, which is key to the company\u2019s future profitability, after a long series of production issues and delays.  Musk has long used Twitter to criticize short-sellers betting against his company, and already faced several investor lawsuits over the Aug. 7 tweets, which caused Tesla\u2019s share price to gyrate.  According to the SEC, Musk \u201cknew or was reckless in not knowing\u201d that his tweets about taking Tesla private at $420 a share were false and misleading, given that he had never discussed such a transaction with any funding source.  The SEC said Musk met for less than an hour with three representatives of Public Investment Fund, at the company\u2019s Fremont, California, plant on July 31 during which the lead representative for the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund expressed interest in taking Tesla private if the terms were \u201creasonable,\u201d according to the lawsuit.  Musk acknowledged the meeting lacked discussion of \u201ceven the most fundamental terms\u201d of the deal and nothing was set in writing, according to the lawsuit. A week later, Musk announced his plan to the world without having discussed the matter again with the fund or looked at many of the logistics of going private, the SEC said.  Late in the day of Musk\u2019s initial announcement of his plans, the head of investor relations was asked whether there was a verbal or written commitment of funding.  \u201cI actually don\u2019t know, but I would assume that given we went full-on public with this, the offer is as firm as it gets,\u201d the head of investor relations responded, according to the lawsuit.  The SEC said that Musk did not communicate with the fund representatives again until three days after his tweets.","991":"FILE PHOTO: A row of new Tesla Model 3 electric vehicles is seen at a parking lot in Richmond, California, U.S., June 22, 2018.

Abbott said during an interview with the Wichita Falls CBS affiliate that he thinks Texas is a perfect fit for Tesla TSLA.O. A spokesman for Abbott confirmed to Reuters the governor spoke with Musk over the weekend.  \u201cI\u2019ve had the opportunity to talk to Elon Musk and he\u2019s genuinely interested in Texas and genuinely frustrated with California,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to wait and see how things play out.\u201d  Abbott did not provide details of the conversation. John Wittman, the governor\u2019s communications director, said there was not yet any discussion of incentives to entice Tesla away from California.  Tesla did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  Musk last Thursday had told employees that limited production would restart at the Tesla factory in Fremont, after California Governor Gavin Newsom said that manufacturers in the state would be allowed to reopen under an easing of coronavirus containment measures. But officials in Alameda County, where Fremont is located, said its own lockdown measures had not been lifted and the factory could not yet reopen.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Musk on Saturday tweeted: \u201cIf we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen (sp) on how Tesla is treated in the future.\u201d  President Donald Trump weighed in on Tuesday, tweeting that California should let Tesla get back to work.  On Monday, Musk said production was resuming at the factory in defiance of the county order and that if anyone had to be arrested, it should be him. On Tuesday, employee parking lots that were deserted on Friday were packed with cars. Trucks could be seen driving in and out of the factory grounds.  Musk is no stranger to Texas. His SpaceX spacecraft manufacturer has a launch site in the southern tip of the state near the village of Boca Chica.  Richard Cortez, the top executive in Hidalgo County just to the west of the SpaceX launch site, urged Musk in a letter to consider the area for Tesla, saying the region\u2019s heavy presence of automotive plants straddling the U.S.-Mexico border could quickly meet the electric car maker\u2019s needs.  Cortez, in an interview with Reuters, underscored that manufacturing plants in his county have never been under any orders to close because of the coronavirus pandemic.  In addition to its vehicle plant in California, Tesla has a battery plant in Sparks, Nevada, and a factory in Buffalo, New York, that produces solar panels and other energy generation and storage products.","995":"FILE PHOTO: Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory groundbreaking ceremony in Shanghai, China January 7, 2019.

He added that Sigma would prefer to ship its lithium directly to Tesla in California, although that can only happen once makers of cathodes, one of the two main battery components, set up shop in the United States.  Gardner said he is a \u201cbig fan\u201d of Tesla, to the point where he tried to import one of the company\u2019s Model 3 sedans for personal use into Brazil, where the electric car maker has no dealerships. He gave up after discovering the car would cost $75,000 given Brazilian import taxes, rather than the roughly $35,000 U.S. price including tax credits.  Sigma, which would be among the world's lowest-cost suppliers of the mineral, has also held informal talks with German automakers Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE and BMW BMWG.DE.  \u201cHaving options to get lithium from other jurisdictions and that you can supply over the long term, that\u2019s what all of them are interested in and we think Sigma can do that,\u201d Gardner said.  Sigma in April struck an alliance with Japan's Mitsui 8031.T which included $30 million in funding for its planned commercial production plant. In return, Mitsui will get roughly a third of the mine's initial planned output of 220,000 tonnes.  The alliance will help Sigma move closer to automakers given Mitsui\u2019s partnerships with Asian battery makers which in turn supply the carmakers, he said.","997":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc shares fell on Thursday as Wall Street wondered if demand for its mass market Model 3 sedan could be sustained while it tries to make substantial inroads in China.  Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said he sees higher demand for the Model 3, as the electric car maker begins to ship cars to Europe and Asia from its Fremont, California factory.  \u201cThe critical Model 3 cost structure appears to be improving with both scale and manufacturing experience, with the company expecting a 25 percent gross margin \u201cat some point\u201d during 2019\u201d Canaccord Genuity analysts said.  The company estimated that Model 3 production at its Freemont plant will rise to 7,000 cars, and its Shanghai factory will build 3,000 Model 3s weekly by year\u2019s end.  \u201cThe profitability picture for Tesla looks encouraging ... with Musk & Co giving some good granularity around projections for 2019 on the demand and production fronts, with ample cash to pay its upcoming debt payment which is around the corner,\u201d Wedbush analysts said in a note.  But some analysts were concerned by Tesla\u2019s indication that it is only making cars for China and Europe right now, and expects a gap of about 10,000 vehicles between production and deliveries because of vehicles in transit at the end of the first quarter.  \u201cThis is a strong indication that demand in the U.S. for both the mid-range and long-range Model 3 versions has largely been exhausted, and the company is still working through the estimated ~6.8k of unsold Model 3 inventory,\u201d Cowen analysts said.

Tesla is pumping money into the Shanghai factory, which it hopes to bring on line at the end of this year with a target of producing 500,000 vehicles annually. But several analysts questioned whether the investment would pay off.  \u201cTesla serves the purpose of a \u2018stalking horse\u2019 to the fast growing domestic Chinese EV industry, but we believe it has limited to zero terminal value in a region where a number of domestic champions should emerge,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts said.

While UBS analyst Colin Langan said there was some relief the company hit the target, he noted that second-quarter vehicle deliveries of 40,740 missed his expectation for 51,000 and the consensus estimate of 49,000.

While Tesla forecast positive net income for the third and fourth quarters, Langan was less optimistic, saying he does not expect a net profit in the third quarter and that a fourth-quarter net profit could be temporary as the average price of the cars sold will likely come down in 2019.

Both the Model 3 and S raised their reliability ratings to \u201caverage.\u201d  \u201cPeople really like their cars,\u201d he said of Tesla owners. \u201cHopefully, if that frantic rate of change can slow down a bit, they can maintain reliability.\u201d  Tesla has touted the popularity of the Model S, listed in the top ranks of a different Consumer Reports survey, on owner satisfaction, every year since 2013 when the carmaker was first included.  Fisher cautioned he expected Tesla\u2019s reliability to remain fluid given its inconsistent track record.  Tesla\u2019s Model X SUV still ranks among the least reliable models, according to the annual survey released on Thursday.(CR.org\/reliability)  The poll predicts which new cars will give owners fewer or more problems, based on data collected for more than 400,000 vehicles. Its scorecard is influential among consumers and industry executives.  Reliability rankings tend to suffer when automakers offer new or redesigned models, which dragged down Volkswagen AG's VOWG_p.DE namesake and Audi brands. The VW brand slid nine spots to No. 27, while Audi fell seven spots to No. 14.  Brands with no major changes to their lineups, such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' FCHA.MI Dodge and Chrysler, made significant gains. Dodge was the highest ranked U.S. brand at No. 8, making the biggest gain of 13 spots. Chrysler rose seven spots to No. 19, while Jeep finished at No. 26.  Ford Motor Co's F.N Lincoln and Ford brands were No. 15 and 16, while General Motors Co's GM.N Buick, GMC, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands ranked No. 18, 22, 25 and last at 30, respectively.  The reliability of full-sized pickups, the most popular vehicles in the U.S. market, was weak.

The latest surge was partly fueled by Panasonic Corp 6752.T saying on Monday its automotive battery venture with Tesla was in the black for the first time.  \u201cInvestors are now starting to believe that Tesla can make mass-volume electric vehicles, and automakers, battery makers and suppliers can make money from EVs,\u201d said Cho Hyun-ryul, analyst at Samsung Securities.  Some analysts have attributed the rally to short covering as well. Short interest in Tesla stood at 13.8% as of Jan. 30, according to Refinitiv data.  Shares of heavily shorted companies can at times get pushed higher as traders rush to buy stock to cover their short bets, triggering what is known as a \u201cshort squeeze\u201d.  Panasonic shares closed up 10%, while those of Tesla's Asian suppliers South Korea's LG Chem Ltd 051910.KS and China's CATL 300750.SZ also closed higher.  Tesla's surge on Tuesday valued the company at nearly $170 billion, nearly double the combined market capitalization of General Motors Co GM.N and Ford Motor Co F.N.  Tesla last week reported a second consecutive quarterly profit and said it would comfortably make more than half a million vehicles this year.  Billionaire investor Ron Baron, whose firm holds a nearly 1% stake in Tesla, said he will not be selling a single Tesla share, adding he believes the carmaker could hit $1 trillion in revenue in 10 years.  Tesla reported revenue of $24.6 billion in 2019.  Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund slashed its stake in the electric carmaker to 39,151 shares from 8.3 million during the fourth quarter, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday.

The daily percentage gain was the stock\u2019s biggest in about four years.  Shares rose 10% in LG Chem and CATL, both of which signed battery-making deals with Tesla last week, ending the automaker\u2019s exclusive partnership with Panasonic.  Shares of fellow EV battery makers SK Innovation Co Ltd 096770.KS and Samsung SDI Co Ltd 006400.KS rose 4.5% and 9%, respectively.  POSCO Chemical Co Ltd 003670.KS, which recently signed a $1.6 billion deal to supply battery-making materials to LG Chem, rose 4.6%.  EV HOPE  Panasonic said on Monday it expects to stabilize profit at Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory by next year, and that there is a lot of room to improve production efficiency for what is an EV\u2019s most expensive component, accounting for about a third of total cost.  The firm is also gearing up to mitigate the loss of the exclusive Tesla partnership by setting up a joint venture with Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T to develop a type of EV battery that the pair plan to sell to any automaker.  \u201cWhen you look back, say two to three years ago, there were doubts about whether the EV era would arrive,\u201d said analyst Kang Dong-jin at Hyundai Investment & Securities in Seoul.  \u201cBut now there is more viability about the sector thanks to Tesla\u2019s strong sales and Europe\u2019s tougher emissions regulations,\u201d he said.  The European Union introduced tighter emission rules after Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE said it had cheated diesel pollution tests.

The shares have surged some 70% since mid-November, when Tesla's debut in the S&P 500 was announced here, and have soared 700% so far in 2020.  Tesla\u2019s addition to the S&P 500 meant index-tracking funds bought $90.3 billion of shares by the end of Friday\u2019s session so that their portfolios reflected the index, according to Silverblatt. The change is effective prior to the open of trading on Monday, S&P said earlier in December, and Tesla is replacing Apartment Investment and Management Co.

Here is a simple guide to the jargon likely to be tossed around at Tesla\u2019s Battery Day on Sept. 22.  FILE PHOTO: The Tesla logo is seen on a car in Los Angeles, California, U.S., July 9, 2020. EUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  CELLS AND PACKS  A Tesla Model 3 uses a single lithium-ion battery pack that houses four smaller modules. Each module contains 700 to 1,000 individual cylindrical cells, shaped much like the ones in a flashlight.  Cells can come in different shapes and sizes, but most have three key elements: Electrodes, electrolyte and separator.  Electrodes store the lithium. The electrolyte carries the lithium ions between electrodes. The separator keeps the positive electrode from coming in contact with the negative electrode.  Energy, in the form of electricity, is discharged from the battery cell when lithium ions flow from the negative electrode, or anode, to the positive electrode, or cathode. When the cell is charging, those ions flow in the opposite direction, from cathode to anode.  Panasonic supplies cylindrical battery cells to Tesla for the Model 3 and Model Y. The positive electrodes are made from a combination of nickel, aluminum and small amounts of cobalt, called NCA.  In China, CATL supplies Tesla with battery cells in a flat format called prismatic, with a different cathode mixture (lithium iron phosphate, or LFP). This material contains no cobalt and is less expensive than Panasonic\u2019s NCA chemistry, but does not hold as much energy or provide as much range as the NCA cylindrical batteries of the same size or mass.  POWER TALK  In electric vehicles, power is expressed in kilowatts (kW) while energy is expressed in kilowatt-hours (kWh).  \u201cTo have great acceleration in an EV, you\u2019d want high power density. To have long range, you\u2019d want high energy density,\u201d said electrochemist Leah Ellis, co-founder of Sublime Systems.  Tesla\u2019s next generation of batteries is expected to be able to store more energy \u2014 and thus enable greater vehicle range \u2014 while providing more power.  Because LFP battery cells typically cannot store as much energy as NCA cells, vehicles that use LFP cells generally require more of them to achieve the same range between charges as vehicles powered by NCA cells.  RANGE AND LIFE  Tesla vehicles currently can drive up to 400 miles between charges with NCA cells and nearly 300 miles with LFP cells. Tesla has said the new Cybertruck will get up to 500 miles.  Tesla\u2019s next generation of batteries is expected to have much longer life: The equivalent of 1 million miles or more, compared with about 500,000 miles today.  MEASURES OF COST  The cost of battery cells and packs is coming down rapidly. Measured in dollars per kilowatt-hour ($\/kWh), experts have pegged $100\/kWh at the cell level as the point where electric cars will begin to approach the cost of vehicles powered by combustion engines and fossil fuel.  A lithium ion battery cell that costs $100\/kWh to produce means a battery pack, with its additional battery management system, cooling system and other materials, could cost $125-$130\/kWh or more.  Today\u2019s battery packs cost around $10,000-$12,000, depending on their capacity. Tesla is aiming to reduce the cost of future packs to less than $6,000, which would put the cell cost at well under $100\/kWh.","1009":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  TOKYO (Reuters) - Sharp Corp has filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the Japanese unit of Tesla Inc, seeking an injunction to halt imports of some electric vehicles (EV) to Japan, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

FILE PHOTO: Tesla CEO Elon Musk at a press conference at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S., February 6, 2018. REUTERS\/Joe Skipper\/File Photo  Musk stunned investors last Tuesday by announcing on Twitter that he was considering taking Tesla private in a potential $72 billion transaction and that \u201cfunding\u201d had been \u201csecured.\u201d  Tesla\u2019s shares closed up 11 percent before retrenching after the Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had asked Tesla why Musk announced his plans on Twitter and whether his statement was truthful.  Musk provided no details of his funding until Monday, when he said in a blog on Tesla\u2019s website that he was in discussions with Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and other potential backers but that financing was not yet nailed down.  Musk said his Tweet and blogs were issued in his personal capacity as a private bidder for Tesla\u2019s stock. A Tesla spokesman pointed Reuters to Musk\u2019s blog in response to a request for comment.  Putting aside whether Musk misled anyone, the unorthodox manner in which he announced the news and Tesla\u2019s failure to promptly clarify the situation with a regulatory filing is a corporate governance lapse that raises questions about how companies use social media to release market-moving news, securities lawyers said.  \u201cManagement buyouts or other take-private transactions already suffer from serious information asymmetry between management and public shareholders,\u201d said Gabriel Rauterberg, a University of Michigan law professor.  SEC rules typically require companies to file an 8-K form within four business days of a significant corporate event.  While several securities lawyers said Musk\u2019s tweets alone did not trigger this obligation, such a filing would be prudent given the unusual circumstances, David Axelrod, a partner at law firm Ballard Spahr LLP, said.  \u201cAn 8-K would provide some more details, it would say what stage negotiations are in, and provide more information than 53 characters in a tweet,\u201d he added.  SEC guidelines published in 2013 allow companies and their executives to use social media to distribute material information, provided investors have been alerted that this is a possibility. Tesla did this in a 2013 filing.  But such disclosures have to be full and fair, meaning the information is complete and accessible by all investors at the same time, a bar that Musk\u2019s tweets may not have met.  \u201cTwitter is not designed to provide full and fair disclosure. That doesn\u2019t mean that you couldn\u2019t, but in a series of 20 to 30 characters I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re getting full disclosure,\u201d said Zachary Fallon, a former SEC attorney and principal at law firm Blakemore Fallon.  The SEC declined to comment on Monday.  Securities lawyers said there was also a question mark over whether Musk selectively disclosed information on the possible terms of the deal when he subsequently replied to followers, two of whom claim in their handles to be investors.  Those tweets were not immediately visible to all followers of Musk\u2019s main feed until he retweeted them.  The 47-year-old billionaire\u2019 s history of joking about Tesla and using twitter to bait his critics, also appears to have undermined trust in Musk\u2019s feed as a reliable source of company information, with many investors initially believing Tuesday\u2019s tweet was a prank.  In his blog, Musk said he made the announcement on Twitter to ensure all investors were aware of his plan before speaking with the company\u2019s largest shareholders.  But his claim to have done so as a private person presents a potential conflict of interest, said Nimish Patel, a lawyer with Mitchell Silberberg & Knupp.  \u201cIf you\u2019re speaking on behalf of the company using resources like Twitter and the company website, while at the same time saying you\u2019re a private individual expressing your own personal views, you are being inconsistent and creating confusion for investors. And when there\u2019s confusion, the SEC is likely going to get involved,\u201d he added.","1011":"SAN FRANCISCO, April 22 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc broadcast a web presentation on Monday to update investors about its self-driving strategy as Chief Executive Elon Musk tries to show that the electric car maker\u2019s massive investment in the sector will pay off.  Global carmakers, large technology companies and an array of startups are developing self-driving - including Alphabet Inc\u2019s Waymo and Uber Technologies Inc - but experts say it will be years before the systems are ready for deployment.  Musk previously forecast that by 2018 cars would go \u201cfrom your driveway to work without you touching anything.\u201d Teslas still require human intervention and are not considered fully self-driving, according to industry standards.  Teslas have been involved in a handful of crashes, some of them fatal, involving the use of the company\u2019s AutoPilot system. The system has automatic steering and cruise control but requires driver attention at the wheel. Tesla has been criticized by safety groups for being unclear about the need for \u201chands-on\u201d driving.  The company also sells a \u201cfull self-driving option\u201d for an additional $5,000, explained on Tesla\u2019s website as \u201cautomatic driving from highway on-ramp to off-ramp,\u201d automatic lane changes, the ability to autopark and to summon a parked car. Coming later in 2019 is the ability to recognize traffic lights and stop signs, and perform automatic driving on city streets, Tesla says.  But Tesla\u2019s use of the term \u201cfull self-driving\u201d still garners criticism, as the option is not yet \u201cLevel 4,\u201d or fully autonomous by industry standards, in which the car can handle all aspects of driving in most circumstances with no human intervention.  Tesla says its cars have the necessary hardware for full self-driving in most circumstances, and Musk said in February he was certain that Tesla would be \u201cfeature complete\u201d for full self-driving in 2019, although drivers would still need to pay attention until the system\u2019s reliability improved.

The stock move was fueled by a surprise third-quarter profit, progress at the new China factory and better-than-expected fourth quarter deliveries.","1016":"Nov 8 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk took to Twitter on Friday to taunt short-seller David Einhorn in an open letter after the hedge fund owner wrote to clients about losing money on his short position in the Silicon Valley car maker.  A copy of the letter posted by the Zerohedge here blog and dated Oct. 30, quoted Einhorn as saying that his Greenlight Capital fund made material losses on Tesla in the second quarter.  \u201cUnit sales in the June quarter improved more than we expected compared to the March quarter,\u201d he wrote in the letter, according to the text posted on Zerohedge.  The fund did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.  Tesla delivered about 95,200 vehicles in the quarter ended June 30, compared with 63,000 by the end of March.  Musk, who has a history of being playful on Twitter, posted his own letter here on Twitter addressing Einhorn as \"Dear Mr. Unicorn (fabulous name btw)\". Einhorn means unicorn in German.  Greenlight Capital first rose to prominence for making a prescient call on Lehman Brothers\u2019 accounting troubles before the firm\u2019s collapse.  Last year, it compared Tesla to Lehman and earlier this year said the company appeared to be \u201con the brink\u201d of failure.  \u201cIt is understandable that you wish to save face with your investors, given the losses you suffered from Tesla\u2019s successful third quarter, especially since you\u2019ve had several down years in performance and a sharp drop in assets under management from $15 billion to $5 billion,\u201d Musk wrote.  \u201cYou have our sympathies,\u201d he added.  Musk invited Einhorn to meet him and tour Tesla\u2019s facilities to learn about the company\u2019s progress.  \u201cFinally, please allow us to send you a small gift of short shorts to help you through this difficult time,\u201d Musk said, signing off as \u201cTreelon Musk.\u201d (Reporting by Neha Malara in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)","1017":"(Reuters) - Influential U.S. magazine Consumer Reports will not recommend Tesla Inc's TSLA.O Model 3 sedan, saying on Monday it braked slower than a full-sized pickup truck, taking the shine off a day of gains for shares in Elon Musk's electric car company.  Musk had driven shares in Tesla as much as 4 percent higher with weekend tweets showing the Silicon Valley company was aiming initially to deliver higher-priced, more profitable fully-loaded editions of the Model 3.  The car is seen as crucial to Tesla\u2019s profitability at a time when it is battling to reverse production shortfalls, confronting reports of crashes involving its vehicles and facing increased skepticism over its finances.  On Twitter, Musk said the fully-loaded Model 3, with all-wheel drive, a dual motor and a 310-mile (499-km) range - but excluding its vaunted Autopilot feature - would cost $78,000. The company has not yet begun to make the $35,000 base price version that Tesla originally claimed would make it a mass-market vehicle.  Consumer Reports, however, declined to recommend the Model 3 and criticized it for having overly long stopping distances and a difficult-to-use center touchscreen.  The magazine, which provides an annual rating of vehicles sold in the United States, said even though its tests found plenty to like about the Model 3 and it was a thrill to drive, it had \u201cbig flaws.\u201d  Tesla's stopping distance of 152 feet (46 m) when braking at 60 miles per hour (100 km per hour) was \"far worse\" than any contemporary car tested by the magazine and about seven feet longer than the stopping distance of a Ford F.N F-150 full-sized pickup, it said.  Tesla said its own testing had found braking distances of 133 feet on average using the 18\u201d Michelin all season tire, and as low as 126 feet with all tires currently available.  \u201cUnlike other vehicles, Tesla is uniquely positioned to address more corner cases over time through over-the-air software updates, and it continually does so to improve factors such as stopping distance,\u201d Tesla said.  The Tesla Model 3 is displayed during a media preview of the Auto China 2018 motor show in Beijing, China April 25, 2018. REUTERS\/Damir Sagolj  \u201cLOSE MONEY AND DIE\u201d  Research firm Berenberg also helped give Tesla shares a boost on Monday, after it raised its share price target to $500 from $470 on Friday.  Its forecast, the highest among over two dozen analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters, is now more than $200 above the stock\u2019s price, which has fallen $100 from September\u2019s peak.  Musk, whose refusal to answer analysts\u2019 questions on a call this month also hurt company shares, said in his weekend tweets that Tesla had to focus first on delivering Model 3s that were priced higher than the base version, or it would \u201cdie\u201d.  \u201cWith production, 1st you need achieve target rate & then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money & die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k\/wk to ship $35k Tesla & live,\u201d Musk tweeted.  The new Model 3 version\u2019s price was similar to the BMW M3, \u201cbut 15 percent quicker & with better handling,\u201d Musk added, without giving details.  Also over the weekend, a Model S sedan crashed and killed the driver in the San Francisco Bay Area, one of a recent spate of crashes, some of which involved fire and some of which took place while the company\u2019s semi-autonomous Autopilot technology was engaged.  In the latest case, the car launched off a rural county road into a nearby pond more than 60 feet from the road, state and local law enforcement said.  The car appeared to be going faster than the posted 35 mph limit, but authorities had not yet determined its speed and whether Autopilot was engaged, a California Highway Patrol spokesman said.  Tesla said it did not yet know the facts and had not yet received data from the car, but was cooperating with local authorities.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it was gathering information and would \u201ctake action as appropriate.\u201d  On Friday, proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) backed a shareholder proposal to separate Musk\u2019s current chairman and CEO roles, suggesting that shareholders would be better served by having Musk focus on running the company.  Tesla shares closed up 2.8 percent to $284.49 on the Nasdaq.","1018":"(Repeats JUNE 23 story. No change to text.)  * Cobalt Prices: tmsnrt.rs\/2V9wc7C  LONDON, June 24 (Reuters) - The unpredictable Elon Musk strikes again.  Just when his electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla seemed to be pivoting away from using cobalt in its batteries, it signs a long-term supply deal for the controversial metal with Glencore.  This from the man who has vowed to eliminate cobalt from the Tesla product mix because of its financial cost and the reputational cost of a metal associated with child labour and poor safety conditions at artisanal mining operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the world\u2019s dominant producer.  Tesla\u2019s not the first auto company to lock in future cobalt supplies with a miner. BMW did the same last year, also with Glencore as well as with the Bou-Azzer mine in Morocco.  But Tesla is the standard-bearer for the EV revolution and its deal with Glencore has strategic significance for the global battery raw materials supply chain.  It\u2019s a boost for cobalt\u2019s prospects, both in terms of physical demand and, more importantly, in the apparent admission that cobalt isn\u2019t going away as a battery material any time soon.  It\u2019s also a warning to other auto companies that if they want cobalt, they\u2019re going to have to take control over their own supply chain.  BATTERY CHOICE  Tesla and its battery partner Panasonic have until now largely used a nickel-cobalt-aluminium (NCA) formula in their lithium-ion batteries.  Other automotive companies targeting the passenger vehicle market have adopted nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) technology.  Everyone has been trying to reduce the amount of cobalt in the metallic mix. Cobalt is expensive, currently trading around $33,000 per tonne on the London Metal Exchange. It has a history of volatility both in terms of price and supply, which is dominated by production, both official-sector and artisanal, in the Congo.  The human cost of artisanal mining also weighs heavy on an industry that is driving towards a green and socially responsible future.  Tesla\u2019s desire to shift away from cobalt usage seemed to be borne out by the revelation its new Chinese plant would use cobalt-free batteries.  Lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries have been around a long time, are cheaper than cobalt-containing batteries, but lack energy density. The biggest market is China, where they are used in vehicles that don\u2019t need extensive range or high performance, such as municipal garbage trucks.  However, it seems that Chinese LFP battery makers such as Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) have been quietly improving the technology to the point that Tesla is now interested in using it in its Model 3 cars in China.  But it\u2019s also clear from the Glencore deal that Tesla, however reluctantly, is going to continue using cobalt in other markets.  Tesla\u2019s willingness to consider a range of battery types is testament that the EV revolution is going to be characterised by multiple chemistries depending on vehicle type and geographic market.  And some of them at least are going to use cobalt.  COBALT BLUES  Tesla\u2019s deal to buy 6,000 tonnes per year of cobalt from Glencore\u2019s Congo operations is a double boost for the market, representing a long-term affirmation of demand and a short-term way of clearing excess stocks.  The cobalt market has yet to recover from the crash that followed the price boom of 2017-2018 as too much supply, particularly from the Congo\u2019s artisanal sector, swamped demand.  Glencore last year placed its Mutanda mine in the Congo on two-year care and maintenance, while its Katanga mine was carrying stocks of almost 13,000 tonnes at the end of 2019.  Those stocks have weighed heavily on the price. Fastmarkets\u2019 assessment of standard-grade cobalt currently sits at an 11-month low of $14.75 per kilogram ($30,250 per tonne)  However, Glencore has recently concluded a flurry of supply deals with battery-makers and now with Tesla, signalling the company \u201chas placed a strategic focus on forward selling its built-up hydroxide stocks,\u201d according to analysts at Roskill.  The research house estimates that Glencore has now locked in sales representing around 82% of production at Katanga. That, combined with Mutanda on care and maintenance, \u201csignificantly reduces the volumes of cobalt available in the open market\u201d.  That may translate into an accelerated price recovery when the next EV-led demand surge happens.  It also means there\u2019s potentially less around for everyone else. There are several new cobalt mines in the planning or development stage but the Congo and its artisanal miners are going to remain the dominant supplier for the foreseeable future.  That simple fact explains why Tesla has moved directly to ensure its own supply with the largest non-Chinese producer in the country.  Other automotive makers may well take heed.  SUPPLY SECURITY  Tesla\u2019s move directly to take responsibility for its cobalt supply isn\u2019t without risk.  Glencore may be a London-listed multinational, but it\u2019s not immune to the negative headlines that go with doing business in the Congo.  It is under intense regulatory scrutiny; the Swiss Attorney General\u2019s Office (OAG) last week joining the list of ongoing investigations into its conduct in the country.  Last year saw the death of 43 \u201cillegal\u201d miners on Glencore\u2019s Kamoto concession, a human tragedy that was compounded by the government\u2019s decision to send in the army to forcibly clear the area.  Tesla, though, has evidently decided the risk of not getting enough future cobalt outweighs the potential reputational risks of taking supply directly from the Congo.  Such direct mine sourcing is not the norm for auto companies. They don\u2019t, for example, directly buy the iron ore that goes into the steel they use. Or the bauxite that makes the aluminium.  But cobalt is different. There\u2019s not much around and too much of what is around comes from the Congo.  The EV revolution may have been stalled by COVID-19, but the build-out of battery manufacturing capacity has continued uninterrupted.  And with the European Union in particular focusing its industrial stimulus package on \u201cgreen\u201d technology, the next EV wave may already be building.  Tesla\u2019s reluctant commitment to cobalt is a warning sign for other automakers they may have to do the same if they want to be sure they\u2019ve got enough of the stuff to meet that coming demand surge.","1019":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Tesla is seen at a branch office in Bern, Switzerland March 25, 2020.

The Shanghai plant is part of the Silicon Valley automaker\u2019s plans to bolster its presence in the world\u2019s biggest auto market and minimize the impact of the U.S.-China trade war.  Fifteen Tesla employees who had purchased the car were the first to take delivery on Monday after the first China-made vehicles rolled off the plant\u2019s production line in October.  The deliveries come a year after construction of Tesla\u2019s only plant outside the United States began. Production started in October with a target of 250,000 vehicles per year once the Model Y is added to the line up.  \u201cAs Model 3s roll off Tesla\u2019s Chinese manufacturing facility with local subsidies intact, we believe the U.S.-based focus will need to shift globally for the company,\u201d Canaccord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote in a note to clients.  China will be an important market for the company in 2020, said Dorsheimer, who raised his price target on Tesla to $515, the second-highest on Wall Street.  The Model 3 is priced at 355,800 yuan ($50,000) before subsidies. Tesla said previously that it wanted to start deliveries before the Chinese new year beginning Jan. 25.  Tesla\u2019s China general manager, Wang Hao, said the company plans to ramp up Model 3 deliveries in January.  Tesla executives also told reporters the plant had achieved a production target of 1,000 units per week, or around 280 cars a day, and that sales for the China-made sedan had so far been \u201cvery good\u201d.

A Tesla showroom is seen in Santa Monica, California, U.S., January 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  Tesla stock is down close to 27 percent this month, within striking distance of its worst month on record. Shares fell 7.7 percent to $257.78 on Wednesday, a day after tumbling 8.2 percent to their lowest close in almost a year.  Tesla was hit by federal probes of a fatal crash on March 23 in California involving one of its vehicles and a downgrade of its credit position by Moody\u2019s Investors Service that cited liquidity pressures and a significant shortfall in Model 3 production.  As the shares sank, put options that convey the right to sell shares at a certain price in the future have jumped in value. With Tesla shares, put options betting on declines below $50, $100 and $200, by mid-January 2019, account for the three largest blocks of open contracts.  While Tesla\u2019s shares remain far above these strike prices, recent losses have boosted the value of the put options.  Put options betting on the shares slipping below $50, changed hands on Wednesday for $1.93 a contract, up from 43 cents, a month ago. The $50, $100 and $200 puts are all trading at more than double their average trading price over the last three months, according to Thomson Reuters data.  \u201cThese puts have actually become something of a running joke on my network with many different people weighing in on why someone would trade a seemingly worthless option,\u201d said Mark Longo of The Options Insider, an options commentary website.  One explanation could be that firms selling credit default swaps on Tesla may be using these puts as a hedge against Tesla going bankrupt, Longo said.  Ophir Gottlieb, chief executive of Los Angeles-based Capital Market Laboratories, said he thinks the position is unlikely to be a hedge against a position in the stock, given how far the strike prices are from where Tesla shares are trading.  \u201cIt would be like having a garden hose after a fire has already burnt the house,\u201d Gottlieb said.  \u201cThe distance between the strikes is very particular. Half of $200 is $100, half of $100 is $50. That sounds like an aggressive put spreader,\u201d he said.  A bear put spread involves buying one set of put contracts and selling another set with the same expiration but at a much lower strike, as a way to offset some of the cost.  \u201cIf it is a speculator, they are looking for the stock to go well below $200, but not a lot below $100. They are looking for disaster, but not bankruptcy,\u201d Gottlieb said.  It was not clear if the position was initiated by one trader or several, but Thomson Reuters data showed that the contracts have steadily grown in number starting around the beginning of 2017.  For Tesla options in general, elevated levels of volatility and skew - a measure of relative demand for puts versus calls - suggest that options market participants see a rough road ahead for Tesla shares, said Henry Schwartz, president at options analytics firm Trade Alert in New York.","1022":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O has a chance at producing 500,000 cars this year, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk told employees, according to an internal email seen by Reuters.

Despite Tuesday\u2019s stock dip, and importantly for Musk\u2019s personal finances, Tesla\u2019s six-month average market capitalization for the first time has reached $150 billion. That triggers the vesting of the second of 12 tranches of options granted to the billionaire in his 2018 pay package to buy Tesla stock at a discount. Musk, who is also majority owner and CEO of the SpaceX rocket maker, receives no salary.  Even with Tuesday\u2019s decline in Tesla\u2019s stock, its six-month average market capitalization rose, thanks to the stock\u2019s strong rally in recent months.  In early May, Musk\u2019s first tranche vested after Tesla\u2019s six-month average stock market value reached $100 billion.  Musk has already achieved targets related to Tesla\u2019s financial growth that are also required in order to vest the latest options tranche.  Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 1.69 million Tesla shares at $350.02 each, less than a quarter of their current price. At Tesla\u2019s current stock price of $1,594, Musk would theoretically be able to sell the shares related to the tranche that vested in May and the current tranche for a combined profit of $4.2 billion, or almost $2.1 billion per tranche.  Musk\u2019s first tranche was worth about $700 million in May, when it vested, but its value has since increased along with Tesla\u2019s stock price.  The median compensation for Tesla employees last year was about $58,000, according to a company filing.  Tesla\u2019s stock has surged more than 500% over the past year as the company increased sales of its Model 3 sedan.  Following higher-than-expected second-quarter vehicle deliveries, some investors believe Tesla might report a profit in its second-quarter report on Wednesday after the bell.

The move increases uncertainty over Tesla's TSLA.O solar business which is already under scrutiny, having been drastically scaled back since the U.S. firm bought it for $2.6 billion in 2016.  Tesla has informed New York that Panasonic\u2019s withdrawal \u201chas no bearing on Tesla\u2019s current operations\u201d, the state said in a statement. The company employs over 1,500 jobs in the city of Buffalo, clearing its 1,460 commitment before April - and thereby avoiding a $41 million penalty - the state said.  Panasonic said in a statement on Wednesday that it would cease production by the end of May and exit the factory by the end of September.  The withdrawal comes as Panasonic scrambles to divest of unprofitable businesses as its strategic shift to components from consumer electronics struggles to drive profit growth.  It is also another sign of a fraying partnership with the U.S. EV maker, which is set to diversify its battery supplies to include South Korea's LG Chem Ltd 051910.KS and China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL) 300750.SZ.  Panasonic said it would continue its automotive battery joint venture with Tesla in the U.S. state of Nevada, which just reported its first quarterly profit after years of production problems and delays.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  In the solar business, low demand from Tesla has left Panasonic sending most of the cells it makes in Buffalo to overseas clients, instead of selling them to Tesla for its trademark Solar Roof - cells designed to resemble regular roof tiles - as initially intended.  When announcing the solar partnership in 2016, Panasonic said it would invest over 30 billion yen ($271.96 million) in the Buffalo plant.

Tesla Inc and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) declined to comment.  EV manufacturers usually use nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) or nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries on passenger vehicles because of their higher energy density, which is critical in determining how far an EV can drive on single charge.  To boost the density and safety of its LFP batteries, CATL has been working on its so-called cell-to-pack technology, the people told Reuters.  It was not clear to what extent Tesla intends to use LFP batteries but the automaker has no plans to stop using its current NCA batteries, said one of the people.  Tesla has been ramping up production of its Model 3 cars at its newly built $2 billion Shanghai plant and cutting prices to win market share from conventional premium automakers such as Germany's BMW AG BMWG.DE and Daimler AG DAIGn.DE.  Tesla started to deliver cars from the factory in December, helping it save on shipping costs and tariffs for imported models. It is currently seeking regulatory approval to make longer-range Model 3 cars at the plant.

FILE PHOTO: A Tesla Model S steering wheel is on display at the Canadian International AutoShow in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, February 13, 2019. REUTERS\/Mark Blinch  The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it opened a review to evaluate claims made in a petition about Tesla\u2019s handling of the software upgrade in Model S and Model X vehicles from the 2012-2019 model years. The agency said the petition\u2019s claims cover about 2,000 Tesla vehicles.  Tesla, headed by billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, has also been sued over updates to its battery-charging software, and this week faced complaints involving vehicles that crashed in parking lots while using a self-driving feature.  The 2,000 vehicles covered by the petition to the NHTSA received a battery management software upgrade in May in response to a potential flaw that could trigger non-crash-related fires. The petition was filed Sept. 17 by the offices of California lawyer Edward C. Chen on behalf of Tesla owners.  It said the software update was believed to have reduced the driving range of the affected vehicles by 25 miles or more per charge.  Chen said Friday that he strongly believes \u201cand various reliable sources have indicated that this number is much larger than 2,000.\u201d  The company did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Tesla shares closed down 0.7% at $231.43 on Friday.

It also cites more than a dozen reports of Tesla\u2019s vehicles catching fire over the past six years.  Tesla has not yet responded to the lawsuit in court.  After a Model S caught fire in Hong Kong, Tesla said it was revising charge and thermal management settings on Model S and X vehicles via an over-the-air software update out of an \u201coverabundance\u201d of caution. The goal was \u201cto help further protect the battery and improve battery longevity,\u201d it said.  Tesla later said it planned to improve the software update after some owners complained.

A driver steers a Tesla Model S at the Nuerburgring race track, in the western German low mountain range of the Eifel near Adenau, Germany October 15, 2019. REUTERS\/Stefan Baldauf  Porsche and U.S.-based Tesla are battling to establish supremacy in lap times for four-door electric sportscars, but comparisons are not exact, as conditions, ranging from car modifications to tyre types, vary with each test.  \u201cWe want to have circumstances that can be understood and replicated,\u201d said Nuerburgring spokesman Alexander Gerhard, adding that the racing circuit operator had moved to tighten rules by which a car maker can claim a certified lap time.  Setting a new record time for four-door electric cars would give Tesla\u2019s ageing Model S a boost just as German rivals Audi, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Porsche prepare to launch their own electric cars.  Automakers use the Nordschleife, one of the world\u2019s most treacherous courses with 40 right-hand and 33 left-hand turns, to hone a vehicle\u2019s sporting characteristics and burnish a car\u2019s image for marketing purposes.  Tesla was spotted this week with a variant of its Model S sedan at the circuit, which is 20.8 km (12.9 miles) long, with slanted cambers and a 300-m altitude difference between its highest and lowest points.  German car magazine Auto Motor und Sport said a Tesla was seen recording an unofficial time of 7 minutes and 23 seconds, which would beat a lap time set by Porsche\u2019s Taycan, which Porsche says achieved a lap time of 7 minutes and 42 seconds.  But Tesla\u2019s challenge has prompted questions about whether the Silicon Valley car maker is playing fair.  \u201cThe car was heavily modified,\u201d said Stefan Baldauf, who photographs prototype vehicles being tested on the circuit for a living.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  \u201cAside from a roll cage and the driver\u2019s seat, the interior had been stripped out,\u201d he added. \u201cThe windows were blacked out, so it was hard to tell.\u201d  The Tesla also appeared to have semi-slick tyres, used only on racing circuits and unsuited for everyday use, Baldauf said.  A Porsche spokeswoman told Reuters its Taycan was tested using standard tyres.  \u201cA comparison is hardly fair if this is the vehicle used to demonstrate that Tesla is faster,\u201d Baldauf added.  Notary Jens Boehle, who certified lap times by Porsche, said, \u201cScope for cheating is as big as you can imagine. Is it a prototype vehicle, a standard road legal vehicle, or is it a specially modified racing version of a standard road car?\u201d  \u201cThese are just some of the questions that need to be answered.\u201d  Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk responded on Twitter this week.  \u201cThe final configuration used at N\u00fcrburgring to set the record will go into production around summer 2020, so this is not merely for the track,\u201d Musk said.  Tesla declined to comment on its lap record effort.  Officials are trying to standardise speed record attempts, Gerhard, the Nuerburgring spokesman, said. In some runs for the record, cars were allowed to make a flying start using a 20.6-km (12.8-mile) stretch of the track.  \u201cWe now mandate that the full 20.8 km is used,\u201d Gerhard added. \u201cAnd we employ a notary to measure the time following rumours that another manufacturer had cheated, by speeding up video footage.\u201d  It also mandates where timing devices should be located.  On Twitter, Musk confirmed that Tesla is using the Nordschleife to market its \u201cPlaid\u201d mode on a 7-seater Tesla Model S.  \u201cWe expect these track times to be beaten by the actual production 7 seat Model S Plaid variant that goes into production around Oct\/Nov next year,\u201d Musk said.  Porsche says its 919 Evo hybrid racecar now holds the overall record for all vehicle categories, with a lap time of 5 minutes and 19 seconds, set in 2018.  Nuerburgring hopes the new rules, introduced this year, will help revive the circuit\u2019s popularity as a venue for competitive benchmarking.  \u201cWe want to be a believable benchmark,\u201d Gerhard said.","1034":"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shanghai will accelerate efforts to cancel restrictions on foreign investment in the auto manufacturing sector, a government official said on Wednesday, a day after Tesla TSLA.O said it would build a wholly owned auto plant in the city.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Earlier this year, China said it would scrap foreign ownership caps for companies making fully electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles in 2018 and all automotive ventures by 2022. The announcement marked a major policy shift in the world\u2019s top car market that has capped foreign ownership in the sector at 50 percent for over two decades.  Huang Ou, deputy director of the Shanghai Commission of Economy and Information Technology, told reporters at a press conference that the city government was engaged in preparations to support the Tesla project, set to be Shanghai\u2019s biggest foreign-invested project.  \u201cThe next step is for the city government to do the support work to allow the project to go into operation as quickly as possible,\u201d he said.  \u201cIn line with state plans, we will speed up the cancellation of foreign ownership restrictions in the car manufacturing sector,\u201d he said.  Huang declined to comment, however, on the size of the project or when the construction of a plant with capacity to produce 500,000 Tesla battery electric cars a year - large by auto industry standards - would start.  Tesla Inc TSLA.O Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk landed a deal on Tuesday to build a new and wholly owned auto plant in Shanghai, the company's first factory outside the United States. It would double the size of the electric car maker's global manufacturing.  The deal was announced as Tesla raised prices on U.S.-made vehicles it sells in China to offset the cost of tariffs imposed by the Chinese government on U.S. imports in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s heavier duties on Chinese goods.  An auto assembly plant half the size of the envisioned Tesla Shanghai plant would normally cost $1 billion to build, according to automotive industry officials and experts.  The Shanghai government said in a statement on Tuesday it welcomed Tesla\u2019s move to invest not only in a new factory in the city but in research and development.  Chinese magazine Caijing, citing sources close to the project, reported on Tuesday that the plant\u2019s exact location had not been decided and construction would start early next year.","1035":"FILE PHOTO: Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk speaks onstage during a delivery event for Tesla China-made Model 3 cars at its factory in Shanghai, China January 7, 2020.

Now the Tesla Inc CEO is looking to reengineer how a company can be taken private.  Musk announced on Twitter on Tuesday that he was considering taking Tesla private for $420 per share, or $72 billion, in what would be the biggest deal of this kind. He said the funding for the deal was secured, but did not provide details.  Tesla shares ended up 11 percent at $379.57, indicating investors gave some credence to the plan.  But investment bankers and analysts reacted with skepticism, telling Reuters it would be hard for Musk, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $22 billion, to raise the equity and debt financing needed for the deal given Tesla is not turning a profit.  \u201cThe company is cash-flow negative. How do you use any debt on a company that is cash-flow negative?\u201d said Steven Kaplan, a University of Chicago professor who researches private equity.  Finding equity partners and bank financing is key to take-private deals. When Michael Dell took his eponymous computer maker private for $24.9 billion in 2013, for example, he brought in buyout firm Silver Lake that contributed $1.4 billion in equity, raised more than $10 billion in bank debt, and received a $2 billion loan from Microsoft Corp.  When a Twitter user commented on Musk\u2019s proposed deal by posting \u201cJust like Dell did. It saves a lot of headaches\u201d, Musk responded by tweeting \u201cYes\u201d.  Dell\u2019s take-private deal, however, may not be possible to replicate with Tesla, which has a $10.9 billion debt pile, is losing money, and whose bonds are rated junk by credit ratings agencies. Without the ability to add more debt, Musk may have to turn to sources of capital that are less accustomed to using debt to juice returns in the way private equity firms are.  SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS  One option could be sovereign wealth funds, investment bankers said.  Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF) has taken a stake of less than 5 percent in Tesla, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. PIF did not respond to a request for comment on whether it would bankroll Musk\u2019s take-private deal.  SoftBank Group Corp\u2019s $93 billion Vision Fund, whose investors include the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, is seen as an obvious partner given its appetite for big technology investments, but was not contacted by Musk and is not interested in a deal given its investment in Tesla competitor Cruise, the self-driving car unit of General Motors Co, according to a source familiar with the matter. SoftBank declined to comment.  China\u2019s Tencent Holdings, which took a 5 percent stake in Tesla last year, is another possible partner.  However foreign capital sources would be subject to scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews deals for potential national security risks. Any proposal for funding from Chinese firms could face even tougher checks amid mounting U.S.-China trade tensions.  Many attempts by founders and top executives to take their companies private have never come to fruition. In March, Qualcomm Inc Chairman Paul Jacobs stepped down from the board to pursue a long-shot take-private bid for the U.S. chip maker, which has a market capitalization of $93 billion. To date, this bid has not materialized.  U.S. department store operator Nordstrom Inc\u2019s attempt to go private also failed earlier this year, after banks balked at providing the necessary financing to the founding family members seeking to put together the deal.  SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLE  Musk has said he would be looking to keep his ownership of Tesla at around 20 percent and that a special purpose vehicle, like the one that exists at his aerospace company SpaceX, would allow Tesla shareholders to remain invested if they so choose, and then cash out when they wanted.  But sources familiar with SpaceX told Reuters it is not clear how Musk would apply it to Tesla. Fidelity Investments, the major backer of SpaceX, did not invest in it through a special purpose vehicle, according to the sources.  Fidelity declined to comment, while SpaceX and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  SpaceX only has a limited number of shareholders, who often choose to sell on their shares in the private market.  By contrast, allowing thousands of Tesla shareholders to remain invested through a special purpose vehicle would essentially mean that shares in that new vehicle are publicly traded in some way.  Even if such a deal was cobbled together, it is not clear whether so-called \u201cliquidity events\u201d, that Musk said he organizes at SpaceX every six months, would be sufficient for all existing Tesla investors to cash out.  \u201cTo have a deal of this size, that\u2019d be unprecedented as far as I can remember,\u201d Kaplan said.

The company also said here in a filing that Model S and Model X sales in China have been, and will likely continue to be, hurt by recently increased tariffs imposed by the Chinese government on U.S.-manufactured vehicles.  The electric carmaker said it continues to push to increase Model 3 production to about 10,000 units per week.  Tesla also expects to continue to increase its Model 3 production rate to about 7,000 units per week at its Fremont, California factory.  China is the largest market for electric vehicles, and most forecasters predict that electric vehicle sales in the country will accelerate rapidly as government regulation drives toward a goal of 100-percent electric vehicles by 2030.

FILE PHOTO: Soros Fund Management Chairman George Soros speaks during a panel discussion at the Nicolas Berggruen Conference in Berlin, October 30, 2012. REUTERS\/Thomas Peter\/File Photo  On Tuesday billionaire investor George Soros disclosed a $35 million stake in Tesla convertible senior notes during the first three months of the year.  Convertible notes give investors the right to trade their debt for equity at a conversion rate and are more appealing to the risk-averse, allowing them to benefit from Tesla\u2019s stock price rising while guarding against the risk that it might not.  Tesla\u2019s stock price hit a high of $386 last year but has since slipped to close at $286.48 on Wednesday.  While Musk has said the electric car maker would not have to raise more cash this year, Wall Street disagrees, with analysts saying the company would need to borrow if it continues to fail to meet its own production targets for building new, lower-cost Model 3 electric sedans.  Investors who evaluated Tesla\u2019s junk-bond offering last year now say a convertible offering appears a more likely option than returning to the high-yield market.  \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful trade,\u201d said Ross Gerber, chief executive of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, who earlier this year bought Tesla convertible bonds due in 2022 and said he is interested in buying more notes.  Tesla investors fretted in late March about the company\u2019s ability to produce the Model 3. A crash involving Tesla\u2019s autopilot technology and its falling bond price also took a toll.  \u201cThe company is burning cash at such a rate that a capital raise is nearly inevitable at some time in the next three quarters,\u201d Henry Peabody, co-portfolio manager for Eaton Vance Multisector Income Fund, who said Tesla would likely use a convertible bond to raise funds.  Tesla could not be reached for comment.  \u201cGiven how volatile the stock is, there are a lot of convertible players out there that would clearly like this type of paper,\u201d said a portfolio manager at a firm among Tesla\u2019s top-10 bondholders. The investor, who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak for the company, said they could be interested in such bonds.  RISK AND REWARD  If Tesla\u2019s stock price stays around current levels, convertible investors, such as Soros, can reclaim the notes\u2019 face value when they come due, a profitable trade if Soros bought them at a discount when the bonds were under pressure.  Soros Fund Management LLC took a $35 million stake in the Tesla convertible bonds due in March 2019 88160RAB7=, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Soros' spokesman did not respond to questions.  In the case of the Soros\u2019 Tesla notes that rate was initially set at a conversion price of $359.87, higher than the $286.48 per share the stock trades at today.  If Tesla\u2019s stock rallies past its conversion rate, Soros could swap his Tesla notes into more than 97,000 shares of Tesla common stock, according to the bond\u2019s prospectus and Soros\u2019 filing. That could make for an even more lucrative trade.  Either way, convertible noteholders pocket interest totaling 0.25 percent per year in the meantime.  Hedge funds also like convertible bonds because they can use them to amplify or mitigate the risk of a short, or bet against, a company\u2019s stock.  By contrast, with a junk bond, an investor\u2019s best-case scenario is full repayment. Stockholders enjoy fewer protections if the company\u2019s finances deteriorate.  Some wary investors said a convertible is a better option for Tesla than a junk bond, but not by much.  After raising $1.8 billion in its first junk bond issuance in August 2017, the 12.6 percent price decline of that bond 88160RAE1=RRPS since it was issued means markets will demand a higher premium on future debt.  Thomas Graff, head of fixed income at Brown Advisory Inc, said a convertible would probably succeed although he would probably not participate.  \u201cA convertible would make a lot more sense given where they are,\u201d said Graff.","1047":"NEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday approved a deal struck between Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over Musk\u2019s use of Twitter, a court filing showed.  U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan approved the deal worked out on Friday that settled the dispute in which the SEC had sought to find Musk in contempt of a securities fraud settlement last year.  Earlier this month, Nathan had ordered the parties to work out an arrangement between themselves.  The new deal lays out in more detail what types of statements by Musk must be reviewed by Tesla\u2019s legal counsel before publication, such as financial statements, previously unreported production or delivery numbers, and other topics.  Regulators had claimed that a February tweet by Musk about Tesla\u2019s production numbers violated the earlier settlement, as it had not been vetted by the company\u2019s attorneys. Musk countered that the tweet was not material.  The SEC sued Musk last year for making fraudulent statements after he tweeted on Aug. 7 that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private at $420 per share.  The parties eventually settled, and the deal called for Tesla\u2019s lawyers to pre-approve written communications, including tweets with material information about the company.","1048":"(Adds comments by investors, background, byline)  LONDON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc\u2019s biggest institutional investor said on Wednesday it was questioned by U.S. securities regulators about Elon Musk\u2019s now-abandoned plans to take the electric carmaker private and that the chief executive needed help running the company.  \u201cHe needs help, and I mean that psychologically as much as practically,\u201d said asset manager Baillie Gifford\u2019s James Anderson, the fund manager of Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, which owns Tesla shares.  Anderson told Reuters he has talked with Musk about the idea of bringing in another executive. Analysts have been calling for Tesla to add a chief operating officer or other new blood to top management.  Tesla, whose shares were up 3.1 percent in afternoon trading after earlier being up 4.5 percent, could not immediately be reached to comment. SEC officials also could not immediately be reached.  The last few months have been tumultuous and chaotic for Tesla and its eclectic CEO. While Tesla was wrestling to ramp up production of its mass-market electric Model 3 sedan, on Aug. 7 Musk tweeted that he was considering taking the company private at $420 per share and that funding was \u201csecured.\u201d  On the evening of Aug. 24, a Friday, Musk, by then facing U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission scrutiny into the factual accuracy of his financing tweet, blogged that Tesla would remain public, citing investor resistance.  Musk was \u201cgetting there\u201d on the idea of accepting more help in running the company, Anderson said.  Anderson said that he had suggested to Musk his tweets are \u201cnot a great thing\u201d and added that the firm had been talking to the SEC about Musk\u2019s proposal and financing claims.  \u201cI don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll do with him, but there\u2019s no implication that we\u2019ve done anything wrong,\u201d Anderson said in an interview at the firm\u2019s London office. \u201cI think quite naturally they wanted to know whether major shareholders had any lead indication or knowledge of the tweet about \u2018funding secured.\u2019\u201d  The next two largest Tesla institutional shareholders, T. Rowe Price Group and Fidelity Investments, both declined to comment on whether they have spoken with the SEC about Tesla.  Anderson said he had spoken with Musk twice and was arranging to speak with the company\u2019s board.  Anderson added that the media coverage around the going-private comments has not shaken his belief in Tesla or its \u201cextraordinary\u201d CEO.  \u201cWe think there is a decent chance that they can prove to be an extremely profitable, competitively advantaged company which will produce high returns,\u201d Anderson said.  Musk has said that Tesla should become profitable in the second half of the year.  Tesla may need to raise more capital and would have a better idea of its needs in the next few months, Anderson said, adding he would support such a move.

The Silicon Valley billionaire\u2019s compensation package announced in January involves no salary or cash bonus but sets rewards based on Tesla\u2019s market value rising to $650 billion over the next 10 years.  Tesla shareholders are due to vote on Wednesday, and the company needs majority approval for the proposal to go through.  California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System (CalSTRS), one of the nation\u2019s largest public pension plans, is the 59th largest investor in the car maker, with a 0.13 percent stake.  \u201cGiven the size of the award, we believe the potential dilution to shareholders is just too great. In addition, we have concerns about the lack of focus on profitability for the company, and the one profitability metric that is used excludes the cost of stock-based compensation,\u201d CalSTRS\u2019s Director of Corporate Governance, Anne Sheehan, said.  Earlier this month, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services recommended Tesla stockholders reject the package, saying the \u201cunprecedented\u201d award was too rich.  Musk could own as much as $55.8 billion in Tesla stock and more than a quarter of the electric car company in the next decade if he hits all targets of the new plan.  Under the proposed award, which involves stock options that vest in 12 tranches, Tesla\u2019s market value must increase to $100 billion for the first tranche to vest and rise in additional $50 billion increments for the remainder.  Tesla is valued at about $52.46 billion at Tuesday\u2019s closing price, according to Thomson Reuters data. Its shares have fallen nearly 12 percent since the pay plan for Musk was announced.

The petition covers 2012 through 2019 model year Tesla Model S, 2016 through 2019 Tesla Model X, and 2018 through 2019 Tesla Model 3 vehicles, the agency said. The petition cites \u201c127 consumer complaints to NHTSA involving 123 unique vehicles. The reports include 110 crashes and 52 injuries,\u201d the agency added.  Late Friday, NHTSA released a redacted version of the lengthy petition that said \u201cTesla vehicles experience unintended acceleration at rates far exceeding other cars on the roads\u201d and urged NHTSA \u201cto recall all Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles produced from 2013 to the present.\u201d  The petition cited media reports of crashes attributed to unintended acceleration and complaints filed with NHTSA.  Tesla did not immediately comment Friday.  Many of the complaints report sudden acceleration incidents when attempting to park vehicles in a garage or at a curb. Others claimed the sudden acceleration happened while in traffic or when using driver assistance systems and led to crashes.  In one complaint, a driver said a 2015 Tesla Model S 85D in California was closed and locked when he claimed \u201ca few moments later the vehicle started accelerating forward towards the street and crashed into a parked car.\u201d  A Tesla driver in Avondale, Pennsylvania, was pulling into a parking spot at an elementary school when the vehicle accelerated on its own, the complaint said adding: \u201cIt went over a curb and into a chain link fence.\u201d  Another complaint said a Tesla driver in Andover, Massachusetts was approaching her garage door \u201cwhen the car suddenly lurched forward: and \u201cwent through the garage door destroying two garage doors.\u201d The Tesla stopped when it hit the garage\u2019s concrete wall.  In October, the agency said it was reviewing whether Tesla should have recalled 2,000 of its electric cars in May instead of issuing a software upgrade to fix a potential defect that could have resulted in battery fires in Model S and Model X vehicles from the 2012-2019 model years.  The 2,000 vehicles covered by the September petition to the NHTSA received a battery management software upgrade in May in response to a potential flaw that could trigger non-crash-related fires. A lawyer who filed the petition, Edward Chen, told Reuters in October that he strongly believes \u201cthis number is much larger than 2,000.\u201d The review is ongoing.  Last week, NHTSA said it was probing the Dec. 29 crash of a Tesla Model 3 that left a passenger dead after the vehicle collided with a parked fire truck in Indiana.  The crash is the 14th involving Tesla that NHTSA\u2019s special crash investigation program has taken up in which it suspects the company\u2019s so-called Autopilot or other advanced driver assistance system was in use.  On Feb. 25, the National Transportation Safety Board will meet to determine the probable cause of the 2018 fatal crash of a Tesla Model X in Mountain View, California. The driver was using Autopilot at the time of the crash.","1051":"Sept 8 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc tumbled 15% early on Tuesday after its surprise exclusion from the S&P 500 index added to the broader sell-off in technology stocks which have dominated Wall Street\u2019s recovery from the coronavirus-driven crash earlier this year.  Wall Street analysts and investors widely expected Tesla to join the S&P 500 after the company posted its fourth consecutive profitable quarter in July, clearing a major hurdle for its potential inclusion in the benchmark stock index.  In a surprise announcement, the S&P Dow Jones Indices decided to add online craft seller Etsy Inc, semiconductor equipment maker Teradyne Inc and pharmaceutical technology company Catalent Inc to the S&P 500 instead.  S&P Dow Jones Indices senior index analyst Howard Silverblatt declined to say why Tesla was not added to the S&P 500.  The three companies included by S&P are much smaller in size, but have a more consistent profitability track record.  However, with a market capitalization of about $390 billion, Tesla is nearly 10 times larger than Etsy, Teradyne and Catalent\u2019s combined stock market value of about $40 billion.  Tesla\u2019s recent stock rally has been driven by its blockbuster quarterly results, as well as on bets it would be added to the S&P 500, which would trigger massive demand for its shares from index funds that track the benchmark.  Shares of Etsy, which have more than doubled this year, were up about 1% in premarket trading, while Teradyne and Catalent were lower.

Tesla said it would offer 2.65 million shares, of which Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk will buy up to $10 million in shares, while board member and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison will purchase up to $1 million worth of Tesla shares.  Tesla\u2019s shares were down roughly 1% in morning trading, retracing losses after sliding as much as 7% in premarket trading. The stock has tripled since October when the company posted a rare quarterly profit. Its market capitalization now exceeds the combined value of General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co.  Musk has repeatedly assured investors that Tesla will not need to raise more money for costly initiatives including production of a new vehicle model, the ramp-up of its China production and the construction of its first European factory.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to raise money,\u201d Musk said during a Jan. 29 earnings call when an investor asked why Tesla does not take advantage of its favorable share price to accelerate production. Musk said the company would generate enough cash on its own to fund ambitious expansion plans.  \u201cDiluting the company to pay down debt doesn\u2019t sound like a wise move,\u201d Musk said on the same call.  Musk also said Tesla needed to produce more batteries to increase vehicle production, adding that some projects like its electric semi-trailer truck program could not proceed without battery improvements.  Tesla is also working on an electric pickup truck, a new generation of the Tesla Roadster, an electric sports car, and automated driving features. The company did not immediately respond to a request for further comment on how to reconcile Thursday\u2019s announcement with Musk\u2019s previous statements.  The decision to raise money will come as a shock to some investors following Musk\u2019s previous comments, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note.  \u201cIn our opinion the size of this offering is larger than many had anticipated, but we believe it\u2019s a smart move by Musk and the Board to take advantage of being back in a position of strength,\u201d Ives said.  Tesla, whose outstanding debt was $13.42 billion at the end of 2019, posted its second quarterly profit in a row in January and said it would comfortably make more than half a million cars this year.  The company said it plans to use proceeds from the offering to strengthen its balance sheet and for general corporate purposes.  Tesla raised about $2.3 billion in May to start production in China and spend on developing new models, including the high-volume Model Y SUV and a Semi commercial truck, whose launch has been delayed due to a lack of battery production capacity.  Since the last capital raise, Tesla has built a $2 billion factory in Shanghai and unveiled the futuristic Cybertruck pickup. The Shanghai factory started delivering cars last month.  Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are the lead joint book-running managers. Barclays, BofA Securities, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank Securities and Wells Fargo are additional book-running managers.

A Fidelity spokeswoman and a representative of Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  It was not clear why Fidelity reduced its holdings or whether it would be interested in supporting a move by the company to go private.  Also during the second quarter, fund managers at the company disclosed a new, near-$30 million stake in a type of bond issued by Tesla that can convert to stock under certain conditions in the future.  Fidelity\u2019s move to cut its stake in Tesla occurred before the surprise move by Musk to seek investors\u2019 help to take the company private.  Musk now faces investor lawsuits claiming securities fraud and a reported SEC probe after sending a tweet on August 7 that there was \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private. Since then, no investors publicly confirmed their involvement.  Quarterly disclosures of fund managers\u2019 stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. SEC, are one of the few public ways of tracking which companies many investors are buying and selling.

The state\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA) disclosed the inspection on Wednesday, two days after news website Reveal said that Tesla\u2019s omissions in legally mandated reports made its safety record appear better than it was.

The injury rate at the Fremont factory, which it had taken over from General Motors Co and Toyota Motor Corp, is half what it was in its final years under the previous owners, the spokesman added.","1067":"(Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N executives on Friday bucked gloomy forecasts for growth and sent the automaker's shares soaring, promising investors stronger 2019 earnings and outlining ambitious plans for its Cadillac brand to challenge Tesla Inc TSLA.O in the growing electric vehicle market.  GM said that despite forecasts of decline in U.S. and China passenger car sales, the company expects 2018 profit to exceed Wall Street expectations, and promised higher earnings per share in 2019. Chief Executive Mary Barra, in her presentation to investors on Friday, stood her ground on cost-cutting actions that have provoked threats of retribution from U.S. President Donald Trump and outrage from unions and elected officials in the affected states.  \u201cBecause of the actions we have been taking for several years, General Motors enters 2019 leaner, more agile and positioned to win,\u201d Barra told investors at the New York presentation.  The market cheered GM\u2019s forecast, sending the company\u2019s stock up nearly 8 percent.  \u201cWe\u2019re very much looking forward to the execution of what they\u2019ve announced,\u201d said Tim Piechowski, portfolio manager with ACR Alpine Capital Research, which owns GM shares. Piechowski said GM\u2019s core business, its stake in ride services company Lyft and its Cruise self-driving car unit are together worth more than the company\u2019s recent share price indicates.  Barra also said proposals from Ohio officials that GM sell its Lordstown, Ohio, small car factory to Tesla are \u201cmoot\u201d because Tesla is \u201cnot interested in our GM workforce represented by the UAW,\u201d the United Auto Workers union.  As Barra spoke with investors in New York, hundreds of GM workers demonstrated in Windsor, Ontario, across the Detroit River from GM headquarters, protesting the company\u2019s plan to shut its Oshawa, Ontario, vehicle assembly plant. The UAW is suing GM in connection with U.S. plant shutdown plans, and on Friday called on GM to build its new electric vehicles in the United States.  GM's bullish outlook coincided with new cost-slashing actions by rival Ford Motor Co F.N, which on Thursday outlined plans to cut thousands of jobs in its European operations and kill an experiment in providing van rides. Ford executives are scheduled to meet with investors next week on the sidelines of the Detroit auto show.  Barra and her lieutenants have spent the last two years pushing a strategy to exit unprofitable markets in Europe and developing markets, restructuring money-losing operations in South Korea, and killing unprofitable car lines in North America. In November it put five North American factories, including four in the United States, on notice for closure, and cut almost 15,000 jobs.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  \u201cWe are no longer investing in things that don\u2019t make money,\u201d GM President Mark Reuss told investors on Friday. \u201cThe future is coming fast. We are doing everything we need to do as fast as we can.\u201d  ELECTRIFYING CADILLACS  That includes making the Cadillac brand \u201cthe tip of the corporate spear\u201d on electrification, Reuss said. He outlined plans to launch a new generation of electric vehicles that would be \u201cprofitable ... and attainable.\u201d  The automaker said Cadillac will become GM\u2019s lead electric vehicle brand as the largest U.S. automaker gears up to introduce a new model under that luxury brand to challenge Tesla, a development first reported by Reuters on Thursday.  Tesla\u2019s market capitalization is higher than GM\u2019s, even though the electric carmaker has never posted a full-year profit.  GM is relying on profit from sales of large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in North America to fund its electrification push. The battle in that lucrative market is intensifying among the Detroit Three automakers as sales of small cars in the United States shrivel. Both GM and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MIFCAU.N have launched revamped pickup trucks in a bid to take more share in the U.S. auto industry's most profitable segment.  Still, GM Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara emphasized to investors on Friday that the large pickup market is a three-company oligopoly protected by \u201ccompetitive moats.\u201d Those include a 25 percent U.S. tariff on imported trucks that predates the Trump administration\u2019s trade actions.  GM's biggest market by vehicle sales volume is China, and the economic slowdown in the world's largest auto market has rattled investors across industries. Apple Inc AAPL.O, for instance, last week took the rare step of cutting its quarterly sales forecast, blaming slowing iPhone sales in China.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  GM\u2019s China president, Matt Tsien, told investors on Friday that industry-wide auto sales in that country should stay roughly flat in 2019 after the 2018 decline. GM is taking actions to cut costs, including increasing automation in its Chinese plants and pushing down purchasing costs, he said. Cost-cutting coupled with 20 new or redesigned vehicles that will launch in China this year will sustain the company\u2019s profit, he said.  \u201cOverall, GM is in a good position to mitigate the headwinds\u201d in China, Tsien said.  Kyle Martin, research analyst with Westwood management in Dallas, Texas, which owns GM shares, said GM\u2019s macroeconomic assumptions are \u201cnot conservative, for sure. For China to be flat, you\u2019re going to need some stimulus.\u201d  GM, with its Chinese partners, sells more vehicles in China than in the United States. The automaker builds locally most of the vehicles it sells in China.  BULLISH EARNINGS OUTLOOK  GM said it expects 2019 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.50 to $7.00, above the $5.86 expected by analysts according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  \u201cBottom line, we believe management just reset the bar higher for earnings and cash flow despite increased macro concerns among investors,\u201d Buckingham Research Group analyst Joseph Amaturo wrote in a client note.  The company said it expects adjusted automotive free cash flow in 2019 to come in between $4.5 billion and $6 billion.  Still, CEO Barra faces pressure to lift GM\u2019s share price, which has lagged broader market performance. The company has confronted challenges from activist shareholders twice during the past four years.  GM shares rose as much as 9.3 percent on Friday and were still up 7.8 percent at $37.45 in afternoon trading.","1068":"FILE PHOTO: Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk speaks on stage during a delivery event for Tesla's China-made Model 3 cars at its factory in Shanghai, China, January 7, 2020.

The U.S. carmaker\u2019s human resources managers, as well as several headhunters, have been trawling the industry over the past four months, the sources said.  They are looking for \u201cbi-cultural\u201d candidates with 20 or more years of experience who are familiar with Chinese tastes and can bridge the gaps between China and the United States, they added.  Some candidates have been interviewed by Tesla\u2019s global design chief Franz von Holzhausen, according to the people, though it was not clear how many potential candidates had been approached by the company and recruiters.  All three sources spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity and confidential nature of the matter.  Tesla and von Holzhausen did not respond to emailed requests for comment.  China is the world\u2019s biggest auto market, plus the largest for all-electric vehicles with sales volumes expected to reach roughly 1.5 million vehicles there this year, according to consultancy LMC Automotive. It is also Tesla\u2019s No.2 market after the United States.  The carmaker\u2019s plans for the design studio are not fully developed, and the sources believe Tesla will likely wait for more clarity on strained U.S.-China relations under a new U.S. president before making a final decision on the move and all its details.  The talent search, which the sources said was mainly focused within China, fits with comments from Tesla boss Elon Musk early last year.  \u201cI think something that would be super cool would be ... to create a China design and engineering centre to actually design an original car in China for worldwide consumption. I think this would be very exciting,\u201d he said at a media event in Shanghai.  FILE PHOTO: Visitors wearing face masks check a China-made Tesla Model Y sport utility vehicle (SUV) at the electric vehicle maker's showroom in Beijing, China January 5, 2021. REUTERS\/Tingshu Wang\/File Photo  FLURRY OF ACTIVITY  Musk\u2019s interest in developing cars in China is part of a broader push by Tesla to boost the company\u2019s global sales volume well past the 500,000-vehicle-a-year mark, which it came just 450 short of hitting in 2020.  All three sources said Tesla\u2019s search for a China studio director began around September, and that there was a flurry of activity as recently as December when a number of headhunters used LinkedIn and other means to approach candidates.  One of the sources, who has knowledge of Tesla\u2019s headhunting activities in China, said that once a design director was hired, Tesla would recruit the director\u2019s team which would likely be around 20-strong and include designers plus modellers who help turn design renderings into clay models.  All the sources said the planned centre aimed to be a comprehensive design outfit, with one describing it as a \u201cfull-function studio\u201d, which would not only help conceptualize the design of a car but also come up with the final shape \u2013 digital three-dimensional data - of a model.  The data could then be handed over to Tesla\u2019s vehicle engineers, who are mostly based in northern California.  Two of the sources said Tesla\u2019s China studio would likely also carry out research on Chinese consumer tastes, as well as work for cars expected to be produced at Tesla\u2019s vehicle assembly plant in Shanghai, where designs are tweaked to make sure specific components fit within engineers\u2019 specifications.  \u201cThey want to give vehicle design a lot more bias toward China; they have already done a lot here, setting up a major manufacturing site and having sold a ton of EVs, but it seems Tesla\u2019s ready to put roots down,\u201d said one of the sources.  This push might lead to a more independent Tesla China, added the person, who has spent more than a decade in the country working at design centres run by global automakers, among other places.  Chinese consumers bought around 145,000 Tesla vehicles last year, accounting for roughly a third of the company\u2019s overall global volumes, LMC said.  $25,000 ELECTRIC CAR  Two of the sources said one likely \u201cChina-specific\u201d model was a lower-cost volume generator such as a $25,000 electric car that Musk referred to at a Battery Day event in September, which he said Tesla might aim to bring to market in about three years.  Musk said Tesla was confident it would be able to hit the market with \u201ca very compelling $25,000 electric vehicle that\u2019s also fully autonomous\u201d.  At that price, according to two of the sources as well as industry experts, it was likely to be a compact car, smaller than Tesla\u2019s Model 3, which would be as affordable as some mainstream gasoline-fueled vehicles.  Compact cars are not big sellers in the United States where bigger, taller vehicles such as Ford\u2019s F-150 pickup truck and SUVs, as well as midsize sedans, rule the road.  They account for about 10% of America\u2019s overall vehicle market. By contrast, compacts make up 25% of sales in China, or around 5-6 million cars a year, according to consultancy LMC Automotive.  That\u2019s why the planned $25,000 car Musk has discussed would be better suited to the China marketplace, according to the two sources and industry experts.  \u201cA compact Tesla car would do well in China, as well as the rest of Asia and Europe,\u201d said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight. \u201cIt could potentially put a serious dent in sales of cars like Toyota\u2019s Corolla and the Volkswagen Golf.\u201d","1073":"FILE PHOTO: The gigafactory of electric carmaker Tesla Inc is seen in Shanghai, China December 2, 2019.

Late on Monday, county health officials said they were aware Tesla had opened beyond the so-called minimum basic operations allowed during lockdown, and had notified the company it could not operate without a county-approved plan.  A county health official on Friday said the county had asked all manufacturers, including Tesla, to delay operations by at least another week to monitor infection and hospitalization rates.  Scott Haggerty, the Alameda County supervisor for the district where Tesla\u2019s factory is located, told the New York Times on Saturday that the county had been working to permit Tesla to resume operations on May 18 - the same day other U.S. automakers have been permitted to resume production in other states.  Haggerty on Tuesday accused Musk on Twitter of misrepresenting what he had told the newspaper.  Tesla on Saturday released a plan to keep workers returning to the factory safe.  The measures, which include temperature screenings, the installation of barriers to separate work areas and protective equipment for workers, are similar to those set up by Detroit-based automakers General Motors GM.N, Ford F.N and Fiat Chrysler FCHA.MIFCAU.N.  Trump is eager for the U.S. economy to reopen and for Americans to return to work.

States and cities around the United States are experimenting with ways to reopen their economies safely after the coronavirus outbreak shuttered businesses and forced tens of millions of Americans out of work.  Musk over the weekend threatened to leave California for Texas or Nevada over his factory\u2019s closure. His move has highlighted the competition for jobs and ignited a rush to woo the billionaire executive by states that have reopened their economies more quickly in response to encouragement from Trump.  Tesla also has a vehicle plant in Shanghai and is building another in Berlin. Its lawsuit on Saturday alleged that Alameda County had violated California\u2019s constitution by defying Newsom\u2019s orders allowing manufacturers to reopen.  Newsom\u2019s office did not immediately comment on Tuesday.  In the past, Musk has discussed opening a second U.S. factory outside California. In a tweet in February, he solicited comments on potentially opening a factory in Texas.","1076":"(Reuters) - Chicago law firm Corboy & Demetrio said on Tuesday it filed a lawsuit against electric carmaker Tesla Inc alleging that its 2014 Model S sedan had a defective battery pack that caused the death of an 18-year old passenger in an accident last year.  The logo is seen on a new all-wheel-drive version of the Tesla Model S car in Hawthorne, California October 9, 2014. T REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  Last May, a Tesla driven by Barrett Riley with passenger Edgar Monserratt Martinez crashed into a concrete wall and erupted in flames in Fort Lauderdale, Florida killing both the teenagers, according to the lawsuit.  The law firm represents the estate of Edgar Monserratt Martinez.  Less than two months before the crash, Riley\u2019s parents had a limiter installed at a Tesla service center to prevent the vehicle from reaching over 85 mph, but it was removed at another Tesla service visit without his parents\u2019 knowledge, the law firm said.  An additional count in the lawsuit alleges Tesla was negligent in the removal of the limiter.  It added that Riley was driving the vehicle at 116 mph, immediately before the collision.  \u201cNo car could have withstood a high-speed crash of this kind,\u201d Tesla said in a statement, adding that its speed limit mode, which allows owners to limit their car\u2019s speed and acceleration, was introduced as an over-the-air update last year in dedication to Riley.  The lawsuit also alleges that Tesla \u201cfailed to warn purchasers of its vehicles of the battery\u2019s dangerous condition.\u201d  The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board had said last year it was investigating the crash.  There have been at least a dozen worldwide reported cases of Tesla S batteries catching fire in collisions as well as while being stationary in the last five years, the law firm said.","1077":"SHANGHAI\/BEIJING (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O broke ground on Monday for its Shanghai Gigafactory where it plans to begin making its Model 3 electric vehicles (EV) by year-end, a first step in localizing production in the world's largest auto market.  At a ceremony at the site of the plant on the outskirts of Shanghai, Chief Executive Elon Musk joined the city\u2019s mayor and other local government officials to formally begin construction of a factory that Tesla has said will cost around $2 billion.  \u201cWe think with the resources here we can build the Shanghai Gigafactory in record time and we\u2019re looking forward to hopefully having some initial production of the Model 3 towards the end of this year and achieving volume production next year,\u201d Musk said at the event.  The so-called Gigafactory is China\u2019s first wholly foreign-owned car plant, a reflection of China\u2019s broader shift to open up its car market, even amid a trade war with the United States which has seen a rise in tariffs on cars imported from the U.S.  Producing cars locally is likely to help Tesla minimize the impact of the trade war, which has forced the EV maker to adjust prices of its U.S.-made cars in China. Keeping prices in check will also help Tesla fend off competition from a swathe of domestic EV startups such as Nio Inc NIO.N, Byton and XPeng Motors.  \u201cAffordable cars must be made on same continent as customers,\u201d Musk wrote on Twitter ahead of the event.  China raised the import tariff on U.S. cars to 40 percent in July, but cut it to 15 percent from the start of this year as part of a trade war ceasefire. The lower rate will last until the end of March pending trade talks.  Slideshow ( 13 images )  Trade war aside, the carmaker is building the plant in an auto market that likely contracted last year for the first time in decades. However, sales of so-called new-energy vehicles (NEVs) - a category which includes Tesla\u2019s battery-powered cars - continue to be strong in a country where the government aims to shift away entirely from combustion engine vehicles.  \u201cShanghai Giga will produce affordable versions of 3\/Y for greater China. All Model S\/X & higher cost versions of Model 3\/Y will still be built in US for WW market, incl China,\u201d Musk said in another tweet, referring to the worldwide market.  CONSTRUCTION TARGETS  Tesla has been pushing forward its plans for the 500,000 vehicle capacity plant after it secured a site in October, hiring staff, starting procurement for building materials and setting up a local financial leasing company.  \u201cAiming to finish initial construction this summer,\u201d Musk tweeted.  Shares in Chinese suppliers to Tesla, including Tianjin Motor Dies Co Ltd 002510.SZ and VT Industrial Technology Co Ltd 300707.SZ, rallied on Monday after Musk's tweets.  \u201cTesla\u2019s sales (in China) have dropped over the past few months because of high price caused by the tariffs. And the competition is getting more and more fierce,\u201d said Alan Kang, Shanghai-based analyst for consultancy LMC Automotive.  \u201cWith the construction of the Shanghai factory, the faster the better (for Tesla).\u201d  (This story has been corrected to say China\u2019s auto market likely contracted last year, not set to contract this year, in the eighth paragraph)","1078":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O is targeting November 2019 as the start of production for its Model Y sport utility vehicle, with production in China to begin two years later, two sources told Reuters this week, shedding some light on the electric vehicle maker's next project that could tax its resources and capacity.  FILE PHOTO: A Tesla dealership is seen in West Drayton, just outside London, Britain, February 7, 2018. REUTERS\/Hannah McKay\/File Photo  Reuters has learned the Silicon Valley company led by Chief Executive Elon Musk is accepting preliminary bids for supplier contracts on the Model Y, a compact crossover companion to the Model 3 sedan. Tesla has given suppliers scant details about the program and had not provided a production time frame, but has now indicated the vehicle would begin to be built at its Fremont, California, plant in November of next year, the two sources with knowledge of the supply chain said.  Tesla declined to comment.  The new Model Y details show that Tesla is pushing ahead on plans to build a new vehicle even as it struggles to produce the Model 3, which launched in July. Despite initially attracting about 500,000 advance orders in the form of refundable deposits, the sedan\u2019s launch has been plagued by delays and manufacturing bottlenecks, postponing Tesla\u2019s anticipated revenue stream and exacerbating a cash crunch for the money-losing company.  Earlier this month, Tesla tried to reassure investors, saying its weekly Model 3 output had doubled during the first quarter and that production rates would accelerate through the second quarter to 5,000 units per week, or about 250,000 vehicles per year.  Competitive bidding is a crucial early step in the complicated process of automotive manufacturing. After the automaker discloses its plans, suppliers compete based on factors including cost and technology.  Tesla issued to suppliers what is known as a \u201crequest for information,\u201d or RFI, which gives a directional view of what will be needed.  With a new car model, automakers normally choose parts suppliers two to two-and-a-half years before the start of production. At about one-and-a-half years away, a November 2019 start date for the Model Y would be considered \u201caggressive, but possible,\u201d said one of the sources. A shorter timeline is potentially feasible, the source said, as the Model Y will be built on the same platform as the Model 3.  Tesla is known for its aggressive timelines and high risk-tolerance in order to get cars to market quicker. To save time and cost, Tesla made the risky bet to skip a pre-production testing phase for the Model 3 in order to advance straight to production tooling, which is harder to fix if problems arise, as Reuters first reported last year.  1 MILLION MODEL Ys?  The Model Y is just one of many projects in the pipeline for Tesla, which also launched a Tesla Semi and a new Roadster in recent months. It is spending to build out its Gigafactory battery factory in Nevada, where battery module assembly issues have contributed to Model 3 delays, and also expects to build a factory in China in the near future.  Tesla has said it will not need to raise additional funds this year. But Moody\u2019s cited the likelihood of a capital raise of more than $2 billion in its downgrade of the company last month, spurred by concerns about cash reserves and Tesla\u2019s ability to meet production targets. The company burned through $3.4 billion last year.  Without giving a time frame, Musk in February told analysts the company would aim for production capacity of 1 million Model Ys per year.  The two sources said suppliers could be estimating an annual production of 500,000 vehicles in the United States, with much lower volume in China, likely in the tens of thousands. Building 500,000 Model Ys per year would be the equivalent of what Musk has planned for total production in Fremont by the end of this year, although the company is nowhere near that volume.  Suppliers generally use automakers\u2019 production targets to formulate a good guess on how many vehicles will actually be built, based on the individual automaker\u2019s capability to execute and consumer demand. One of the sources said Tesla\u2019s RFI was light on details compared with other automakers, and did not provide volume estimates for the Model Y.  Musk said in February that capital investments related to the SUV would begin toward the end of 2018. Tesla has said its current factory in Fremont could produce 10,000 vehicles a week - what the company hopes it will build in the Model 3 alone some time in 2018 - without the need for a new building, although some in the industry believe there is not enough room at the plant to support that volume.  Any major Model Y program would likely require a new facility, although low volume of the Model Y could be built on the existing Model 3 line, the sources said.","1079":"FILE PHOTO: General Motors assembly workers connect a battery pack underneath a partially assembled 2018 Chevrolet Bolt EV vehicle on the assembly line at Orion Assembly in Lake Orion, Michigan, U.S., March 19, 2018.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk is finally giving Tesla shareholders some good financial news. Third-quarter earnings unveiled after the markets closed on Wednesday brought an unexpected, if small, profit of $143 million at the electric-car maker. Unlike this time last year, fast-growing sales weren\u2019t the cause: cost discipline was. That\u2019s a welcome change.  General and sales costs both fell, while there were no restructuring costs at all, compared with $117 million in the second quarter. Throw in an all-round improvement at the troubled SolarCity franchise, and Tesla had some $450 million extra to play with. Musk has been promising to cut outlays for some time, so it\u2019s encouraging to see it kick in at last.  It was needed, too. Tesla may have sold a record number of cars last quarter, but the feat did not translate into a booming top line. Revenue actually fell slightly from the three months to the end of June, and was down 12% on last year\u2019s bumper third quarter. That\u2019s because the company handed over more of its cheaper Model 3s than ever before.  The key to Tesla\u2019s success now is for Musk to find a way to reinvigorate sales growth that has slowed to low single digits while also continuing to keep costs under control. In addition he has to ensure that lower expenses don\u2019t compromise the safety and quality of the cars, issues which have plagued the company for a couple of years. Keeping relatively quiet on social media, a newly learned habit for Musk, would be a good one to stick at, too.  Traders dabbling in after-hours markets seem already to have made some bets that Musk is finally getting on track, with Tesla\u2019s stock up some 20% from the company\u2019s closing market capitalization just shy of $46 billion.

FILE PHOTO: Walmart's logo is seen outside one of the stores in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., November 20, 2018. REUTERS\/Kamil Krzaczynski  Solar energy systems installed and maintained by the electric car maker were responsible for fires at seven locations, with dozens showing hazardous problems such as loose wiring and \u201chot spots\u201d on panels, according to court papers filed in New York State Supreme Court.  Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.  The lawsuit accuses Tesla of having untrained workers putting up shoddy installations and showing \u201cutter incompetence or callousness, or both,\u201d court papers said.  The lawsuit is the latest blow to Tesla\u2019s struggling solar business, which it acquired through its $2.6 billion purchase of SolarCity in 2016. Quarterly installations have plummeted more than 85 percent since the deal, as Tesla has cut its solar panel sales force and ended a distribution deal with Home Depot Inc .  The fires destroyed significant amounts of store merchandise and required substantial repairs, totaling millions of dollars in losses, Walmart said in the lawsuit.  In addition, inspections of the retailer\u2019s other Tesla-owned solar installations \u201cdisplayed troubling problems that were indicative of widespread negligence,\u201d the lawsuit said.  As of November 2018, at least seven Walmart stores, including in Denton, Maryland and Beavercreek, Ohio, had experienced fires due to Tesla\u2019s solar systems, according to the lawsuit. One of the fires happened months after the system was de-energized, Walmart said.  The suit argues that inadequate inspections by Tesla have created a safety hazard for Walmart customers and employees.  \u2018MONEY PRINTER ON YOUR ROOF\u2019  Walmart became a SolarCity customer in 2010 and over the next six years fitted 244 of its store rooftops with panels in a bid to improve its image as an environmentally aware company and to lower its energy costs. In the lawsuit, it asks for the court to require Tesla to remove all of its systems from Walmart stores, which are now all de-energized.  Walmart has a goal of sourcing 35 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2020. The retailer was a major customer for SolarCity, which added both residential and commercial installations at a rapid clip while taking on significant debt.  In the lawsuit, Walmart accused SolarCity of having \u201can ill-considered business model that required it to install solar panel systems haphazardly and as quickly as possible in order to turn a profit, and the contractors and subcontractors who performed the original installation work had not been properly hired, trained, and supervised.\u201d  Under the terms of its solar energy contracts, SolarCity, and then Tesla, was required to install, maintain and operate the panel systems, according to the lawsuit.  In July, Walmart gave Tesla 30 days to provide analyses of the root causes of the fires, compensate the retailer for damages to its stores and demonstrate an overhaul of its operations, among other measures. As of Aug. 15, Tesla \u201cstill had not taken any reasonable steps toward curing its breaches,\u201d the lawsuit said.  Three days later, on Aug. 18, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk announced the re-launch of the company\u2019s solar business that allows customers to install solar panels without a long-term contract.  \u201cIt\u2019s like having a money printer on your roof,\u201d Musk wrote on Twitter.

NHTSA has \u201ctaken a nonregulatory approach to automated vehicle safety\u201d and should \u201ccomplete a further evaluation of the Tesla Autopilot system to ensure the deployed technology does not pose an unreasonable safety risk,\u201d NTSB said.  The board faulted Apple Inc and other smartphone makers for refusing to disable devices when users are driving. It also called on the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration to use its authority to take action \u201cagainst \u201cemployers who fail to address the hazards of distracted driving.\u201d  The board\u2019s criticism posed a direct challenge to the auto industry\u2019s efforts to profit from partially automated vehicles and the smartphone industry\u2019s quest to keep user eyes on their devices.  The NTSB can only make recommendations, while NHTSA regulates U.S. vehicles. NHTSA has sent teams to investigate 14 Tesla crashes in which Autopilot is suspected of being in use, but taken no action against the company.  Concerns have grown about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches with little or no human intervention, but cannot completely replace human drivers.  \u201cIt\u2019s time to stop enabling drivers in any partially automated vehicle to pretend that they have driverless cars. Because they don\u2019t have driverless cars,\u201d NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said.  The Mountain View, California crash - involving a driver who was playing a game on his phone during the fatal trip - illustrates \u201csemi-autonomous vehicles can lead drivers to be complacent... and it also points out that smartphones manipulating them, can be so addictive, that people aren\u2019t going to put them down,\u201d Sumwalt added.  Walter Huang, a 38-year-old Apple software engineer, was driving his Tesla Model X in 2018 in Autopilot mode at about 70 miles per hour (113 kph) when it crashed into a safety barrier. The NTSB said Huang had been using an iPhone and recovered logs showed a word-building game was active.  The probable cause of Huang\u2019s crash was Autopilot steering the vehicle off the highway \u201cdue to system limitations, and the driver\u2019s lack of response due to distraction likely from a cell phone game application and overreliance\u201d on Autopilot, the NTSB said. Huang on prior trips had intervened when Autopilot steered the vehicle toward the same \u201chighway gore\u201d area.  NHTSA said it will carefully review the NTSB\u2019s recommendations. The agency added that commercial motor vehicles \u201crequire the human driver to be in control at all times.\u201d  Tesla drivers are able to avoid holding the steering wheel for extended periods while using Autopilot, but Tesla advises keeping hands on the wheel and paying attention.  Sumwalt said Tesla allowed drivers to remove their hands from the wheel for up to three minutes under certain conditions when using Autopilot.  The NTSB said Tesla added safeguards to require quicker warnings at higher speeds for drivers without hands on the wheel.  Regulators in Europe place limitations on Autopilot use and Tesla issues alerts there for hands-off driving within 15 seconds, the NTSB said.  Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.  NTSB Vice Chairman Bruce Landsberg called Autopilot \u201ccompletely inadequate\u201d and noted Tesla vehicles have repeatedly crashed into large obstacles.  Sumwalt said Tesla - unlike five other auto manufacturers - has ignored NTSB safety recommendations issued in 2017.  Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is tied to at least three deadly crashes since 2016 and suspected in others.  The NTSB will release in coming days the probable cause of a third Tesla Autopilot fatal crash in March 2019 in Florida that showed no evidence the driver\u2019s hands were on the steering wheel in the final 8 seconds before striking a semi-trailer truck.  The NTSB also called on cellphone manufacturers to add more safeguards to prevent the misuse of devices by drivers.

News Corp Deputy Chief Operating Officer James Murdoch attends the Allen & Co Media Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho July 12, 2012. REUTERS\/Jim Urquhart  Tesla has until Nov. 13 to appoint an independent chairman of the board, part of settlements reached last month between Tesla, Musk and U.S. regulators after Musk tweeted in August that he had secured funding to take the electric car maker private.  The SEC settlement capped months of debate and some investor calls for stronger oversight of Musk, whose recent erratic public behavior raised concerns about his ability to steer the money-losing company through a rocky phase of growth.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which said Musk\u2019s tweeted statements about going private were fraudulent, allowed the billionaire to retain his role as CEO while requiring he give up his chairmanship.  Musk had said he was considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420 a share, a number that is slang for marijuana. He tweeted the three-word denial of the Financial Times story, on Wednesday at 4:20 pm PT (2320 GMT), about six hours after the newspaper\u2019s post.  In a vote of confidence for Musk, shareholder T. Rowe Price Group Inc said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that it had raised its stake to 10.2 percent at the end of September from just under 7 percent in June.  The Financial Times cited two people briefed on discussions saying Murdoch was the lead candidate for the job.  Murdoch, already an independent director of Tesla, has signaled he wants the job, the report said.  The son of Fox mogul Rupert Murdoch, he joined Tesla\u2019s board last year after years of work with media companies. He has no experience in manufacturing and has never led a company that makes cars or electric vehicles.  Murdoch could not immediately be reached for comment. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Twenty-First Century Fox declined to comment.  BOARD ROLES  Musk is the public face of Tesla, and any chairman would have to contend with his powerful personality. Thanks to his vision and audacious showmanship, Tesla\u2019s valuation has at times eclipsed that of traditional, established U.S. automakers with billions in revenues and the company has garnered legions of fans, despite repeated production issues.  \u201cThe question when it comes to James Murdoch is, \u2018Is he the guy who\u2019ll be able to establish that level of authority with Elon Musk?\u2019\u201d asked Abby Adlerman, CEO of Boardspan, a corporate governance consulting company.  Murdoch, who at 45 is a near contemporary of 47-year-old Musk, recently navigated a takeover battle between Fox and Comcast Corp to buy European pay-TV company Sky, which he also chaired.  His record in ensuring Sky\u2019s independent shareholders were represented throughout was exemplary, media analyst Alice Enders said.  \u201cHis experience is very recent and very relevant,\u201d she said.  Investor concerns that Tesla\u2019s board was too closely tied to Musk led to the company\u2019s addition of two independent directors, including Murdoch, in July 2017.  Earlier this year, leading U.S. proxy advisers Glass Lewis & Co and Institutional Shareholder Services, and union-affiliated investment adviser CtW Investment Group, had recommended investors cast votes \u201cagainst\u201d the re-election of Murdoch as a Tesla director at the company\u2019s annual meeting held on June 5.  While CtW cited a lack of relevant experience and a \u201ctroubled history as an executive and director,\u201d both proxy firms warned that Murdoch already served on too many boards.  Murdoch currently serves on the boards of Twenty-First Century Fox and News Corp. He stepped down from Sky Plc on Tuesday following the completion of Comcast Corp\u2019s takeover of the broadcaster.  He was appointed chief executive of Sky, founded by his father, in 2003, becoming the youngest CEO of a FTSE 100 company.  \u201cUnder his leadership, Sky went down the technology route,\u201d Enders said. \u201cIt\u2019s no accident he oversaw that strategy, which was really distinct from the strategy other pay-TV companies followed, and in my view was his most valuable contribution.\u201d  Murdoch replaced his father as chairman of Sky in 2007, but was forced out in 2012 after being embroiled in Britain\u2019s phone-hacking scandal.  He returned to Sky\u2019s board in 2016 after rebuilding his career at Fox.  Glass Lewis research director Courteney Keatinge said on Wednesday that while Murdoch\u2019s departure from Sky could alleviate some concerns, the Tesla chairmanship would still require a big time commitment as the company faces pressures on many fronts.  \u201cI would still have reservations about the time he would be able to allot to this,\u201d Keatinge said.  According to the FT report, external options were still being considered.  Considering a broad choice of candidates was important, said Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of CtW Investment Group, because \u201cInvestors should really be wary about the board making the easy choice here\u201d in opting for Murdoch.  Murdoch is set to be succeeded by his brother Lachlan Murdoch as Twenty First Century Fox chief executive officer, after the media group completes the sale of bulk of its assets to Walt Disney.  \u2018STABILITY AT THE TOP\u2019  Tesla faces a crucial moment as it struggles to produce its Model 3 sedan in large volume and deliver it quickly to customers amid an ongoing cash crunch that has concerned some analysts. Musk has vowed that the loss-making company will be profitable and cash flow-positive in its third and fourth quarters.  Concerns about production delays and manufacturing challenges have been exacerbated by a series of damaging actions, including Musk insulting analysts on a conference call, calling a British cave rescuer a pedophile, and joking on April Fool\u2019s Day that Tesla was going bankrupt.  Shares are down 20 percent since the beginning of the year.  \u201cElon Musk is building a great company but has been erratic to say the least when it comes to thinking about his investors,\u201d said Chaim Siegel, an analyst at Elazar Advisors. \u201cThe company needs some added stability at the top to win back investor confidence.\u201d  Under terms of the SEC settlement, Musk is not permitted to be re-elected to the chairman\u2019s post for three years. Tesla is also required to appoint two new independent directors to its board.","1093":"Oct 17 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's vice president of manufacturing, Gilbert Passin, has left the company, Business Insider reported here on Wednesday, citing a source familiar with the situation.

The 5,000th car finished final quality checks at the Fremont, California factory around 5 a.m. PDT (1200 GMT), one person said. It was not clear if Tesla could maintain that level of production for a longer period.  Musk said the company hit its target of 5,000 Model 3s in a week, according to an email sent to employees on Sunday afternoon and seen by Reuters. Tesla also expects to produce 6,000 Model 3 sedans a week \u201cnext month.\u201d  \u201cI think we just became a real car company,\u201d Musk wrote. The company hit the Model 3 mark while also achieving its production goal of 7,000 Model S and Model X vehicles in a week, Musk said in the email.  Tesla confirmed the contents of the email.  After repeatedly pushing back internal targets, Tesla vowed in January to build 5,000 Model 3s per week before the close of the second quarter on Saturday to demonstrate it could mass produce the battery-powered sedan.  Money-losing Tesla has been burning through cash to produce the Model 3, and delays have also potentially compromised Tesla\u2019s first-to-market position for a mid-priced, long-range battery electric car as a host of competitors prepare to launch rival vehicles.  Production of the Model 3, which began last July, has been plagued by a number of issues, including problems from an over-reliance on automation on its assembly lines, battery issues and other bottlenecks.  As the end of the quarter neared, Musk spurred on workers, built a new assembly line in a huge tent outside the main factory, and fanned expectations that Tesla could hit its target, including tweeting pictures of rows of auto parts and robots over the final days of the quarter.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  \u201cIt was pretty hectic,\u201d said one worker who described the atmosphere as \u201call hands on deck.\u201d  Another worker speaking after the 5,000th car was made described the factory as a \u201cmass celebration.\u201d  Tesla is likely to announce production and delivery numbers for the quarter later this week, and investors will watch to see whether the company can keep up its end-of-quarter production speed and increase efficiency to produce the cars at a profit.  REPEATABLE?  Tesla will have to prove to investors that it can sustain and increase its production pace, and some skeptics have bet against the company.  Short sellers lost over $2 billion in June due to Tesla\u2019s rising share price and this latest achievement could buoy the company\u2019s shares at market open on Monday.  Shares of Tesla, which closed on Friday at $342.95, are up 40 percent since a year low in April.  In recent months, the company has engaged in so-called \u201cburst builds,\u201d temporary periods of fast-as-possible production, which it uses to estimate how many cars it is capable of building over longer periods of time.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Analyst Brian Johnson of Barclays warned investors in March to be wary of brief \u201cburst rates\u201d of Model 3 production that were not sustainable.  One worker told Reuters that, to meet the goal, employees from other departments were dispatched to parts of the Model 3 assembly line to keep it running constantly, and breaks were staggered \u201cso the line didn\u2019t stop moving.\u201d  The worker also said some areas within the factory were shut down to divert their workers to help out on the Model 3, such as the Model S line.  That suggests that Tesla was able to generally meet its production target through manual labor, rather than the automation Musk originally promised would make Tesla a competitive force in manufacturing. Earlier this year, Musk - who has described his vision for the Fremont factory as an \u201calien dreadnought\u201d - acknowledged error in adding too much automation, too fast, to the Model 3 assembly line.  In May, Tesla sent a new battery assembly line via cargo planes to its Gigafactory battery plant outside Reno, Nevada in order to speed production, as first reported by Reuters.  When first unveiled in March 2016, the Model 3 generated thousands of reservations from consumers in an unprecedented show of support for the new vehicle. Most recently in May, Tesla said that despite the delivery delays, its net Model 3 reservations - accounting for new orders and cancellations - exceeded 450,000 at the end of the first quarter.  Despite touting the Model 3 as a $35,000 vehicle, Tesla has yet to begin building that basic version and instead is currently building a higher-priced version. It is not clear how many of the orders are for the more premium version.  Steady progress has enthused others, however, and Tesla's market value is close to that of General Motors Co GM.N.  The company has said it will not need to raise cash this year.","1095":"May 22 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc:  * TESLA SPOKESPERSON SAYS CONFIRMS SNAP\u2019S VICE PRESIDENT OF MONETIZATION, STUART BOWERS, IS JOINING COMPANY AS VP, ENGINEERING Further company coverage:","1096":"April 29 (Reuters) - When Tesla Inc reports first-quarter results after the bell on Wednesday, many individual shareholders will not be looking for details on the subject that drives most conversations: the effect of the novel coronavirus pandemic.  Their view vastly differs from that of traditional analysts and institutional investors, who want to hear updates on Tesla\u2019s 2020 cash flow and potential moves to boost demand during a prolonged recession due to the epidemic.  Submitting questions for Tesla's earnings call on a website here, retail investors want to learn about Tesla's steps to expand into the robotaxi market, the company's self-driving technology and even plans to create airless tires to reduce maintenance costs.  Of the top 50 questions, only four refer to the novel coronavirus, with one investor asking what safeguards Tesla would implement to protect employees at U.S. factories. Another probed whether Tesla had plans to expand into the grocery delivery market, where demand has skyrocketed during the pandemic.  Investors can vote for a particular question and Tesla management, including Chief Executive Elon Musk, generally answers the most popular ones during an earnings call.  Currently, the No. 1 retail investor question is whether Musk will stick to his target for a 50% compound annual growth rate over the next five to 10 years, or whether a 40% target would be more realistic.  Many institutional analysts expect Tesla to have a compound annual growth rate of around 20%.  Analysts on average expect March quarter revenue to jump 30% to $5.9 billion, according to Refinitiv, down from an initial February estimate of $6.7 billion.  Tesla in early April reported strong vehicle deliveries in the first three months of 2020 - a time when other U.S. carmakers grappled with a slump in sales as virus woes and lockdown restrictions began taking hold.  The company in mid-February raised $2 billion in a stock offering, and investors on Wednesday will probe whether that covers the company\u2019s cash burn at a time when Tesla ramps up production of its new Model Y sport utility vehicle.  Institutional analysts also expect details on Tesla\u2019s plans to restart factory operations after its only U.S. vehicle factory near San Francisco was forced to close at the end of March. The company originally said it would resume operations on May 4, but Bay Area health officials on Monday extended shelter-in-place orders to the end of May.","1097":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window.)  * Trump says trade deal \u201cpotentially very close\u201d  * China\u2019s Xi says wants to work out an agreement  * Nordstrom jumps on 2019 forecast raise  * Tesla drops after unveiling electric pickup truck  * Indexes: Dow up 0.22%, S&P up 0.05%, Nasdaq off 0.12% (Changes comment, updates to open)  Nov 22 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow Jones indexes eked out gains on Friday after President Donald Trump signalled an imminent trade deal with China, while the Nasdaq was weighed down by a slump in shares of Tesla after the launch of its electric pickup truck.  Trump told Fox News that a trade deal with China was \u201cpotentially very close\u201d, adding to optimism from remarks by President Xi Jinping that Beijing wanted to work out an initial agreement. Reports earlier in the week had indicated that a truce could be delayed to 2020.  \u201cThe positive tone right now is because people have resigned themselves to the fact that they are not going to see a big deal anytime soon, as there are lot of little issues that are going to persist,\u201d said Jeanette Garretty, managing director & principal at Robertson Stephens Wealth Management.

The benchmark S&P 500 index remained on course to end the week with its first decline in seven, while the Nasdaq is eyeing its first weekly drop in eight. A largely better-than-expected corporate earnings season also contributed to the recent rally.  Latest economic data underscored a resilient domestic economy, with U.S. manufacturing output accelerating in November to its fastest pace in seven months and services activity picking up more than expected.  Six of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were trading higher, led by financials.  At 10:44 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 60.07 points, or 0.22%, at 27,826.36, while the S&P 500 was up 1.59 points, or 0.05%, at 3,105.13.  The Nasdaq Composite was down 10.08 points, or 0.12%, at 8,496.13, dragged by a 7% slump in shares of Tesla Inc as its electric pickup truck design received an underwhelming response.

FILE PHOTO: SpaceX owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk speaks during a conversation with legendary game designer Todd Howard (not pictured) at the E3 gaming convention in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 13, 2019. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Whether billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s flagship company can start mass production quickly enough to hit stated targets is the question investors will want an answer to when Tesla announces third-quarter results on Wednesday.  The U.S. electric vehicles maker is under pressure to ramp up output globally, and the Shanghai plant\u2019s production schedule is crucial if it wants to reach its ambitious target of an annualized production rate of 500,000 vehicles by the end of the year.  Tesla last week obtained the certificate it needs to start manufacturing cars in the country. But analysts contend that uncertainties around labor and suppliers make it a challenge to start mass production.  \u201cThere is a lot in the equation that is not in their control,\u201d said Tu Le, analyst at China-based research firm Sino Auto Insights.  \u201cThere are some things that just need time in order to complete, like qualifying new manufacturing processes, a new battery supplier, getting the tooling shipped and set up, as well as setting up all the suppliers. Any parts that have to be imported need to go through customs, which also could mean delays,\u201d he said.  Tesla is also in the process of obtaining a key certification needed to sell China-made cars in the country, it told local media, though it is unclear when the government will grant it sales clearance.  Tesla did not reply to an email seeking comment.  It said in April it aims to produce at least 1,000 Model 3 cars a week at the new factory by the end of this year.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Analysts, though, are doubtful that Tesla will hit this target, given its patchy production record.  Delays and quality issues have marred the launches of Tesla's Model S and Model X vehicles in the past, and Tesla struggled to start here making the Model 3 at its California factory in 2017.  The company took six months longer than originally forecast to hit a target of 5,000 Model 3 cars per week, achieving that pace about a year after launching production.  Still, Tesla is taking steps to ensure a smooth launch of production, including trying to diversify its battery supplier base, sources have said.  It recently bought Maxwell Technologies, whose technology could help the car maker produce batteries that last longer.  At hiring events in Shanghai in August and September, attended by Reuters journalists, Tesla interviewed hundreds of candidates from mainstream car makers in China.  It also advertised on social media for battery-related production and software system engineers in Shanghai, and delivery managers in big Chinese cities.  FURTHER LOSSES?  China, for its part, is helping speed up things at the Shanghai factory - the country\u2019s first fully foreign-owned car plant, a reflection of Beijing\u2019s broader shift to open up its auto market.  State-owned construction companies have arranged extra workforce and banks are offering cheap loans, while the government said it will exempt Tesla cars from its purchase tax, a concession made amidst trade tensions with the United States.  The Model 3 has fared well in China, the world\u2019s biggest car market.  Tesla sales in China likely surged more than three fold to 10,542 cars in the quarter ended Sept. 30, according to research firm LMC Automotive.  The company expects to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars this year globally.  Analysts expect Tesla\u2019s third-quarter revenue to decline 7% from the year-ago quarter, according to Refinitiv data. They predict a loss of 42 cents per share, excluding one-time items, in contrast to Musk\u2019s promises that the company would break even in the quarter.  Gross margins likely shrank to 15.6% from 22.3%.  \u201cThe biggest overhang around the story is the ability to hit profitability and to achieve its ambitious unit guidance for 2019,\u201d Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a pre-earnings research note.","1099":"(Corrects spelling of Jalopnik in paragraph 3)  July 5 (Reuters) - A California agency for occupational safety said on Thursday it opened a third investigation at Tesla Inc\u2019s factory in Fremont, California, following a complaint.

Driven in part by interest from institutional investors, the price of bitcoin has quadrupled in the past four months, surging far beyond record highs set in 2017.

Companies with much more significant exposures to bitcoin in proportion to their overall stock market value than Tesla have also rallied following Tesla\u2019s disclosure, increasing already strong stock gains driven by the cryptocurrency\u2019s recent rally.  MicroStrategy, whose CEO Michael Saylor is an avid bitcoin bull, surged 22% on Tuesday, bringing its gain this week to over 50%, and it has surged over 200% so far in 2021.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under President Donald Trump has moved away from the practice of leveling huge monetary penalties against corporations.  That enforcement trend, according to four experts, could benefit Tesla as the company faces an SEC investigation of CEO Elon Musk\u2019s Aug. 7 tweet about \u201csecured\u201d financing for a private buyout of the company.  \u201cI expect Tesla to pay zero,\u201d said Georgetown law professor Urska Velikonja, who is engaged in an ongoing analysis of SEC enforcement trends against companies and individuals.  SEC Chair Jay Clayton has emphasized accountability for individual wrongdoers, rather than holding corporations responsible for employees\u2019 misconduct.  Even if the commission ultimately concludes Musk\u2019s tweet was unfounded, the Tesla CEO\u2019s potential penalty would probably be less than $200,000, according to two securities law professors and a defense lawyer who tracks SEC enforcement at the SEC Actions blog.  Tesla declined to comment on the experts\u2019 assessment of potential exposure to the SEC.  Lawyers from Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz, which represents Tesla CEO Musk, did not immediately respond to an email request for comment. The SEC declined to comment.  SHARP DROP IN PENALTIES  Last year, Georgetown\u2019s Velikonja documented a sharp drop in total penalties assessed by the commission after Clayton took over as chairman. This year \u2013 Clayton\u2019s first full year as SEC chair \u2013 the decline is even more notable.  According to Velikonja, the agency has assessed about $592 million in monetary penalties in cases settled in the first 10.5 months of fiscal year 2018, which ends next month. Those are the lowest aggregated SEC penalties in at least a decade, Velikonja said. The previous low, according to the Georgetown professor, was $656 million over the same 10.5 month-period in fiscal year 2012.  The drop in penalties reflects the SEC\u2019s pivot away from the quasi-prosecutorial role it adopted after big financial frauds in the 2000s.  \u201cThe Clayton administration is trying to bring the agency back to its roots in civil enforcement,\u201d said securities defense lawyer Stephen Crimmins of Murphy & McGonigle. \u201cThe focus is on putting in place structural changes\u201d to avert future misconduct, according to Crimmins.  The commission has also emphasized penalizing individual wrongdoers rather than corporations, on the theory that shareholders should not bear the cost of their own deception. As a company, said Michigan law professor Adam Pritchard, Tesla issued a \u201cmeasured and responsible\u201d statement after Musk tweeted his go-private plan.  \u201cTesla should not and won\u2019t be sanctioned,\u201d Pritchard said.  What about Musk himself?  The full story behind Musk\u2019s tweet about the financing of a buyout is not publicly known, though Tesla on Monday posted a blog entry in which the CEO said he was referring to funding assurances from the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund.  Defense lawyer Crimmins said SEC investigators will likely look for documentary evidence and testimony to back or refute Musk\u2019s assertion that he reasonably believed the Saudi fund would finance his contemplated buyout.  SEC investigations can take years but Crimmins said this inquiry seems straightforward and could be concluded quickly.  Thomas Gorman, a securities defense lawyer at Dorsey & Whitney who authors a blog about SEC enforcement, said the facts that have already emerged make it unlikely the SEC will bring a case against Musk.  \u201cNOT THE STUFF OF GOVERNMENT ACTION\u201d  \u201cWhile one might select better language if the sentence was wordsmithed, that (tweet) is not the stuff of a government enforcement action,\u201d Gorman said.  If the SEC does conclude Musk\u2019s tweet was misleading, three experts said, his penalty will probably be a relatively paltry amount - less than $200,000.  That amount could be higher, according to Crimmins, if the commission determines Musk\u2019s tweet was fraudulent, not merely negligent.  The SEC has so far targeted 63 individuals for reporting violations in fiscal year 2018, according to Velikonja\u2019s analysis. They have paid on average a $75,000 penalty.  Federal regulations permit the SEC to seek up to $160,000 from individuals for each securities violation. The SEC has in the past devised ways to multiply violations to increase penalties but defense lawyer Gorman and law professors Velikonja and Pritchard said the commission would probably count Musk\u2019s tweet as a single violation if it determined the assertion of secure funding to have been misleading.  \u201cThe value of the case for the SEC is sending a message,\u201d said Velikonja. \u201cThis would be the SEC saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to go after the biggest guys. We\u2019re not afraid of Elon Musk.\u2019\u201d  The commission can also seek injunctions. The most extreme punishment the SEC can impose is a prohibition on serving as an officer or director of a public company. Experts do not expect such a draconian penalty in the Tesla case, especially, according to Crimmins, because Musk is so integral to the company\u2019s prospects.  But if the commission finds a violation, the SEC could enjoin Musk and Tesla from future misleading communications. That sort of prohibition, said Michigan prof Pritchard, would mean more severe consequences for subsequent breaches of securities law.  The SEC can even insist that Musk and Tesla agree to vet future market-moving tweets with securities lawyers before they\u2019re posted, according to Crimmins.  \u201cThat would be an elegant solution,\u201d he said.

The U.S. company had said in planning documents that the factory would need 372 cubic meters of water from the public drinking water network per hour, sparking protests by local residents earlier this month.  \u201cSounds like we need to clear up a few things! Tesla won\u2019t use this much net water on a daily basis. It\u2019s possibly a rare peak usage case, but not an everyday event\u201d, Musk said on Twitter on Saturday.  On another environmental issue, Musk tweeted that only a small part of the forest on the property that Tesla bought in the outskirts of Berlin will be cut to construct the planned factory.  \u201cAlso, this is not a natural forest -- it was planted for use as cardboard,\u201d he said.  The U.S. carmaker announced plans last November to build its first European car factory in Gruenheide, in the eastern state of Brandenburg.  Politicians, unions and industry groups have welcomed the move, saying it will bring jobs to the region, but environmental groups have aired concerns and a Brandenburg water association warned against \u201cextensive and serious problems with the drinking water supply and wastewater disposal\u201d for the proposed factory.

Retailers from Amazon to Apple to traditional automakers have trumpeted the benefits of physical stores, and Apple and automakers also rely heavily on advertising, which Tesla has eschewed, making the electric carmaker an outlier in its dependence on the web.  As Tesla pushes to broaden its appeal and drive up sales with the arrival of the $35,000 Model 3, the impact of the store closings announced on Thursday will play out over time, answering questions about whether a national physical footprint is necessary in an increasingly digital world, analysts and investors said on Friday.  \u201cCustomers are becoming increasingly comfortable making purchases online, and that is especially true for Tesla,\u201d Chief Executive Elon Musk said in an email to employees, which CNBC posted online.  However, some analysts and investors question whether Tesla closing most of its 250 stores was the panicked decision of a company seeking to build the lower-cost model profitably. Shares in Tesla closed 7.8 percent lower to $294.79 on Friday.  It was only last month that Musk said a $35,000 version that could be sold profitably was perhaps six months away. And in the company\u2019s annual report released last month, Tesla talked about growing its network of stores.  \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a leap of faith that\u2019s required to have confidence that the moving from a physical distribution model to an online distribution model will succeed,\u201d Tom Vandeventer, portfolio manager with Tocqueville Opportunity Fund, said in a telephone interview. He has owned Tesla stock in the past and still follows the company closely.  \u201cPeople like to go to car showrooms and kick the wheels and sit in the car,\u201d he added.  However, Musk pointed out in the email that 78 percent of all Model 3 orders were placed online and 82 percent of customers bought such models without ever taking a test drive. He said shifting to an online sales model, cutting jobs and reducing spending on marketing will allow Tesla to offer the lower vehicle price. Tesla also said Thursday it now expects to record a loss in the first quarter.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  To overcome any remaining hesitation, Musk said Tesla would make it easier for customers to return a car within seven days or 1,000 miles for a full refund.  \u201cGiven its seeming abruptness, it does not appear that yesterday\u2019s announcement was made from a position of strength,\u201d Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi Jr said in a research note entitled, \u201cThe $35k Model 3 - Genius or Desperation?\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Vandeventer still likes Tesla\u2019s innovative, forward-thinking nature, but worries about the short term.  \u201cCutting prices is more often a sign of weakness unless you are Amazon,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd only Amazon is Amazon.\u201d  Adding to the pressure Tesla faces is the growing level of competition from Chinese electric carmakers as well as established players like Volkswagen\u2019s Audi and Porsche brands, and Jaguar Land Rover.  Meanwhile, U.S. dealers remain sanguine about their position in the sales chain.  \u201cWe still believe that the franchised dealer model is by far the best way to sell, distribute and service new vehicles,\u201d National Automotive Dealers Association spokesman Jared Allen said. \u201cThe vast majority of consumers want to do some combination of both online and traditional shopping for new vehicles.\u201d  Since unveiling the Model 3 in 2016, Musk has been promising a $35,000 version. A lower-priced Model 3 is seen as critical to Tesla\u2019s long-term viability as it needs to reach more customers who can afford the vehicles to offset slowing sales of costlier sedans.  The lower price could expand the Model 3 market by about 600,000 cars in the United States alone, based on historical sales figures for similarly priced sedans, Baird analyst Ben Kalo said in a research note. However, the lower-cost model also could squeeze profit margins at a time when Tesla has said it is targeting 25 percent margins for the vehicle some time this year.","1117":"FILE PHOTO: A Tesla logo is seen at a groundbreaking ceremony of Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory in Shanghai, China January 7, 2019.

Shares of Chinese car dealers also perked up on hopes that such a move could revitalize the domestic auto market that is poised for its first annual sales contraction in decades amid cooling economic growth and a debilitating U.S.-China trade war.  Trump, fresh from agreeing a 90-day cease-fire in his trade war with China at the meeting of the G20, said on Twitter \u201cChina has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S. Currently the tariff is 40%\u201d.  The move, if realized, would bolster U.S. carmakers who were hit hard when China ramped up levies on U.S.-made cars in July as part of a broad package of retaliatory tariffs amid the sprawling trade war between Washington and Beijing.  \u201cIf they cancel the extra 25 percent tariff on U.S.-made cars, then we will see positive signs for imported cars,\u201d Wang Cun, director of the China Automobile Dealers Association\u2019s import committee, told reporters in Beijing.  Beijing raised tariffs on U.S. auto imports to 40 percent in July, forcing many carmakers to hike prices in a major hit to the roughly $10 billion worth of passenger vehicles the United States sent to China last year.  That put U.S.-made car brands like Tesla Inc and Ford Motor Co\u2019s Lincoln at a major disadvantage as the move came soon after China slashed auto import tariffs for the wider market to 15 percent from 25 percent.  Trump\u2019s tweet did not give any further detail about the tariff cuts, such as when the deal had been reached or a new level for the Chinese levies.  The White House and U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s (USTR) office did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Sunday.

In China, listed car dealers such as Grand Automotive, Pangda Automobile Trade and Sinomach Automobile climbed on the news, with some local carmakers falling back.  Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to halt new tariffs during talks in Argentina on Saturday, following months of escalating tensions on trade and other issues.  Cars are seen in a parking lot in Palm Springs, California April 13, 2015. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  After a 2-1\/2 hour dinner with Xi on Saturday in Buenos Aires, Trump agreed to postpone an increase in the tariff rate on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent that was scheduled for Jan. 1. China agreed to resume purchases of some U.S. farm and energy commodities.  The two sides also agreed to negotiate in the next 90 days over \u201cstructural changes\u201d to China\u2019s policies on technology transfers, intellectual property protection, non-tariff barriers, cyber intrusions and theft, services and agriculture.  Major U.S. automakers said they were unaware of the lower tariffs on exports to China.  The automakers have a previously scheduled meeting with USTR on Monday, two people briefed on the matter told Reuters.  The lower tariffs would be a boost to automakers exporting vehicles to China, including Ford and German carmaker BMW, which exports U.S.-built luxury vehicles to China.  It would also be good news for Tesla that has been hit hard by increased tariffs on the electric cars it imports to China.  The U.S. firm, led by billionaire Elon Musk, has said it will cut prices to make its cars \u201cmore affordable\u201d and absorb more of the hit from the tariffs. Tesla is also building a local plant in Shanghai to help it avoid steep tariffs.  The United States currently charges tariffs of 27.5 percent on Chinese vehicles. On Wednesday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said Trump had directed him to examine all available tools to raise U.S. tariffs on Chinese vehicles to the level that China is charging.","1119":"NEW YORK\/LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin powered to a record high on Tuesday, approaching the $50,000 mark, basking in the afterglow of Elon Musk-led Tesla\u2019s investment in the cryptocurrency that had investors believing it may become a mainstream asset class.  FILE PHOTO: A representation of virtual currency Bitcoin is seen in front of a stock graph in this illustration taken January 8, 2021.

It traded at a few hundred dollars only five years earlier.  Glassnode, which provides insight on blockchain data, said in its latest report that bitcoin\u2019s limited supply suggested further gains for the virtual asset.  Bitcoin\u2019s liquid supply is continuing to decrease, as investors increasingly acquire and \u201chodl\u201d the asset for the long term. \u201cHodl\u201d is crypto slang for the act of an investor holding the asset instead of selling it.  Currently, around 78% of issued bitcoin are either lost or being \u201chodled.\u201d This leaves less than four million bitcoins to be shared among future market entrants - including large institutional investors such as PayPal, Square, S&P 500 companies, and exchange traded funds, Glassnode said.  On Monday, bitcoin leapt 20% after Tesla announced it had a $1.5 billion investment and that it would eventually take the cryptocurrency as payment for its cars. That was its largest daily rise in more than three years.  It climbed to a peak of $48,216.09 - almost enough to buy one of the best-selling Tesla vehicles, the Tesla Model Y SUV. Rival cryptocurrency ethereum struck a record high of $1,825.36 on Tuesday.  Musk\u2019s foreseeing acceptance of the currency as payment for Tesla cars has analysts reckoning this is a large shift as companies and big investment houses follow small traders into the asset.  Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, remains unconvinced and said bitcoin remains a speculative vehicle.  \u201cThe fact that it draws some institutional investors or even some companies does not change this fact. Bitcoin has no earnings stream that can be modeled,\u201d said Chandler. \u201cIt has no break-up or replacement cost. There is no intrinsic value. They have no use-value the way economists understand it.\u201d  Bitcoin\u2019s volatility has also been a hindrance for some serious investors and a sticking point in using it for transactions. Realized volatility, or daily price swings measured in terms of closing prices for bitcoin over the past 90 days, was at 72%, compared with 16% for the S&P 500 stocks index and 6% for the euro currency.  What\u2019s more, with bitcoin\u2019s value tripling in the past three months, analysts raised questions over how its volatility would affect someone buying a Tesla car in bitcoin.  \u201cUnless the price of bitcoin stabilizes, either bitcoin\u2019s price falls drastically and you end up having won a Tesla in a lottery, or its price triples and you end up paying your Tesla far too expensive,\u201d said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.  \u201cEARLIEST PHASES\u201d  Billionaire Musk has long been a cryptocurrency fan - he has talked them up online - but Tesla\u2019s hard currency investment came as a surprise that has put a rocket under the sector.  \u201cRight now, it still seems like a bit of a leisurely pursuit, to acquire bitcoin. But I think by the end of the year, with the current rate of institutional flow inbound, it will become clear that this is a once-in-a-lifetime landgrab,\u201d said Jehan Chu, founder and managing partner at Kenetic, which invests in blockchain-related companies.  Still, in BofA\u2019s January fund manager survey, bitcoin topped the list of \u201cmost crowded\u201d trades. Another survey, by Deutsche Bank, warned of price bubbles in the cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin is already up 67% this year, on top of a 300% rally last year, as investors search for alternatives to the dollar because of the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s 0% interest rates. The dollar slid against most currencies on Tuesday.

However, Vitor Constancio, former vice-president of the European Central Bank, wrote on Twitter that policymakers should focus on regulating cryptocurrencies and develop digital currencies only if they will help banks in their role of enabling credit creation.

The trading on Monday will be a test of how investors are taking the demise of the buyout plan, and their views on whether Musk, who owns about a fifth of Tesla, can avoid going back to capital markets to raise more cash.  Tesla\u2019s shares already had fallen nearly 10 percent below their level on Aug. 7, just before Musk tweeted that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d for a buyout at $420 a share.  Investors in Tesla\u2019s bonds and convertible debt also had shown skepticism that the buyout would materialize during the days after that tweet, and a subsequent blog post in which Musk made a case for going private.  With Musk\u2019s idea of a buyout backed by Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund off the table, investors will focus on Tesla\u2019s efforts to become profitable, the company\u2019s cash reserves and what steps Musk could take to raise fresh capital.  Musk and Tesla also face a series of investor lawsuits and a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the factual accuracy of Musk\u2019s tweet that funding for the buyout deal was \u201csecured.\u201d  Tesla had $2.78 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter, after a record $718 million loss.  In early August, before the buyout plan was made public, Tesla reiterated a forecast that it would achieve a profit in the third and fourth quarters, under normal accounting rules, and Musk said the company would not need to raise more cash. A Tesla spokesman on Sunday referred to those previous comments.  One of Tesla\u2019s biggest challenges is ramping up production of its latest vehicle, the Model 3, which is critical to its profitability goals.  TAPPING CAPITAL MARKETS  Analysts have suggested a capital raise may be required soon to boost investor confidence. Musk and Tesla could hold off on any fundraising plans for the time being, in part tapping capital markets would contradict Musk\u2019s comments about Tesla being adequately funded, investment bankers who are not working for the company said over the weekend.  This week would also be an inopportune time for a capital raising, given that many bankers and investors are away ahead of the Sept. 3 Labor Day holiday.  The high price investors have put on Tesla\u2019s shares has allowed Musk to expand U.S. production, invest in building out a vehicle charging network and start work on new models including a small sport utility vehicle, a new Roadster and a semi-truck even as the company burned cash.  Tesla earlier this year announced plans to build a battery and vehicle assembly complex in China. Musk said earlier this month (AUG) the company\u2019s \u201cdefault plan\u201d would be to fund that expansion by borrowing money from Chinese banks.

REUTERS\/Aly Song  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk\u2019s fortunes have sure turned around fast. Just last June shares in Tesla, the electric-car maker he runs, had halved in six months as investors doubted whether a recent capital raise was enough; short-sellers pontificated about the imminent collapse of the company. Seven months and a near-160% gain later, though, and Tesla shares have hit a new high, and the company is worth just shy of $90 billion. That, like one of the acceleration settings on its cars, is ludicrous.  There are reasons for optimism. The maker of the Model 3 finally hit one of Musk\u2019s targets, delivering just enough cars last quarter to squeeze past the lower end of his goal of 360,000 to 400,000 for the year. And its factory in China is up and running, having taken less than a year to build, and can produce up to 500,000 vehicles a year.  Justifying the stock price, though, requires steadfastly believing in one of two developments. The first is that Musk will soon have his company routinely selling some 3 million cars a year. That calculation is based on Tesla managing to improve its pre-tax margin, which in the third quarter was a lowly 2.8%, to around 7.6% and that as a mature, rather than fast-growing, company it trades at 8.6 times earnings \u2013 both metrics a blend of luxury carmakers BMW and Daimler, and the best-performing mass-producer, Toyota Motor. It also assumes a 21% tax rate and that carmaking accounts for the vast majority of Tesla\u2019s revenue.  Those assumptions don\u2019t have to be anywhere near so heady if the company is close to becoming a robo-taxi giant. Musk himself has pledged there will be 1 million self-driving-enabled Teslas on the road in 2020. Its owners could rent them out when not using them, with Musk\u2019s outfit taking a cut as well as running its own fleet. The latter could, over time, bring in 10 times as much revenue as just selling the car, General Motors reckons.  Trouble is, neither is realistic any time soon. The first would require a more than eightfold increase in production, way beyond Tesla\u2019s current or planned capacity; the second demands regulatory approval and then customer acceptance that at present looks many years off. The most recent sales targets aside, Musk\u2019s track record at delivering on promises is abysmal. At this point, shareholders are parking their money on a hope and a promise.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked a federal court in Manhattan to hold Musk in contempt after he tweeted about Tesla\u2019s production volume, saying he breached the agreement requiring him to get company approval before sharing any material information on social media.  The renewed public battle between Tesla\u2019s CEO and the SEC adds pressure on Musk, the public face of the electric vehicle-maker who is struggling to make it profitable after cutting the price of its Model 3 sedan to $35,000.  Tesla has backed off a plan to close all its U.S. stores and will instead raise prices of its higher-end vehicles by about 3 percent on average.  Musk on Feb. 19 tweeted to his more than 24 million Twitter followers that Tesla would make around 500,000 cars in 2019.  He corrected the tweet four hours later to say the annualized production rate at year-end 2019 would probably be about 500,000, with deliveries of about 400,000.  A lawyer for Tesla and Musk told the SEC that the CEO believed the substance of the tweet had been pre-approved and disseminated when the company released fourth-quarter earnings in January.  The September settlement between Musk, Tesla and the SEC resolved an SEC lawsuit over claims Musk made on Twitter in August that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The SEC called those tweets \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d and a go-private deal never materialized.  As part of that settlement, Musk stepped down as the company\u2019s chairman and he and Tesla agreed to pay $20 million each in fines.  Musk had called the regulator the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission\u201d after the settlement, and tweeted that \u201csomething is broken with SEC oversight\u201d just one day after the SEC started pursuing the contempt order. Hours later, U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan set a March 11 deadline for Musk to respond.  On Monday morning, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton declined to comment when approached by Reuters at an event in Washington on what penalties the agency planned to pursue against the billionaire.  Legal experts have said the SEC could try multiple avenues, including a higher fine, imposing further restrictions on Musk\u2019s activities or removing him from Tesla\u2019s board or helm.  Tesla published a new communications policy in December for executives as part of the settlement. It called for Tesla\u2019s general counsel and a newly designated in-house securities law attorney to pre-approve any written statements about Tesla that could be material.  A disclosure controls committee, made up of board members Brad Buss, Antonio Gracias and James Murdoch, was tasked with overseeing compliance with the new policy.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of LG Chem is seen at its office building in Seoul, South Korea, October 16, 2020. REUTERS\/Kim Hong-Ji  The firm, a supplier for Tesla\u2019s Shanghai-built Model 3, will also ship its increased output from China as well as Korea to Tesla\u2019s factories in Germany and the United States, said two people with knowledge of the matter, signalling an increased role in the supply chain of the world\u2019s leading EV manufacturer.  The plan comes as Tesla, LG Chem\u2019s primary customer, scrambles to secure cells as part of an aggressive global production expansion plan, as it targets soaring demand fanned by governments promoting EVs to curb air pollution.  LG Chem has already added production lines in South Korea this year mainly to meet demand from Tesla\u2019s U.S. plant, the people said. Moreover, the automaker has asked Japan\u2019s Panasonic Corp - which supplies the U.S. plant - to also supply its Shanghai factory, said one of the people, who declined to be identified as the matter was confidential.  \u201cTesla simply doesn\u2019t have enough battery cells,\u201d said the person. \u201cSo LG Chem is going to more than double China output.\u201d  Tesla\u2019s growth represents a boon for LG Chem, Panasonic and Chinese supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL), with Chief Executive Elon Musk revealing plans in September to increase purchases.  Still, Musk said supplies were insufficient and announced Tesla\u2019s plans to make its own, cheaper battery cells - a prospect that could injure suppliers\u2019 pricing power.  \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to expand capacity for cylindrical battery cells in response to growing demand from automakers but we can\u2019t comment on specific customers,\u201d an LG Chem spokesman said.  LG Chem, whose battery cell business on Tuesday became an independent unit, in October said it would triple capacity of cylindrical cells to 60 gigawatt hours by 2023, without naming Tesla or disclosing other details. Its China plan and Germany and U.S. destinations are reported here for the first time.  Tesla was not immediately available for comment. Panasonic declined to comment.  MODEL Y  LG Chem will invest $500 million over the next year to raise annual production capacity of 21700 cylindrical battery cells - a type used by Tesla - at its Nanjing plant by 8 GWh, the local government said last week, without disclosing current capacity.  The two people told Reuters the plan involved increasing the number of production lines to at least 17 from eight.  LG Chem, alongside CATL, supplies battery cells for Tesla\u2019s Model 3 sedan built in Shanghai, where production began last year and whose current annual capacity is 250,000 cars. Tesla aims to start making its Model Y sport-utility vehicle at the plant next year, for which capacity will reach 250,000 by 2022, Morningstar previously reported.  Each model uses 4,416 battery cells, and each LG Chem line is able to produce up to 7 million cells a month, one of the people said. LG Chem\u2019s 17 lines in Nanjing would therefore be able to cater for up to 323,000 vehicles a year, a Reuters calculation showed.  Initially, LG Chem will be the sole supplier for Shanghai-built Model Y cars, said one of the people. CATL was not immediately available for comment.  LG Chem\u2019s China factory will also initially supply battery cells for Tesla vehicles in Berlin when production there begins, the person said. The automaker needs permission should it want to make its own cells locally.","1128":"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla Inc was added to a government list of approved automotive manufacturers, China\u2019s industry ministry said on Thursday, as it granted the electric-vehicle maker a certificate it needs to start production in the country.

This means \u201cthe green light is fully given to Tesla for production in China,\u201d said Yale Zhang, head of the Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight. Tesla can start production any time, he said  Tesla did not immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment. The $2 billion factory it is building in the eastern Chinese city of Shanghai is its first car manufacturing site overseas.  Reuters reported earlier this month that Tesla plans to start production at its China factory this month. It is unclear when it will meet year-end production targets because of uncertainties around orders, labor and suppliers.  Tesla intends to produce at least 1,000 Model 3s a week from the Shanghai factory by the end of this year, as it tries to boost sales in the world\u2019s biggest auto market and avoid higher import tariffs imposed on U.S. cars.

Tesla Inc pulled workers from other departments to keep pumping out the Model 3 electric sedans, disrupting production of the Model S and X lines. And weekend shifts were mandatory.  Tesla pulled out all the stops in the final week of June to meet its goal of making 5,000 Model 3s in a week, according to employees who spoke to Reuters.  Whether Tesla can do it week in and week out - and without relying on overtime and extra hands - is another question, and one that weighed on investors Monday, as shares slumped 2.3 percent.  Leading up to Sunday morning\u2019s production milestone, Musk paced the Model 3 line, snapping at his engineers when the around-the-clock production slowed or stopped due to problems with robots, one worker said. Tesla built a new line in just two weeks in a huge tent outside the main factory, an unprecedented move in an industry that takes years to plan out its assembly lines, and said the tented production area accounted for 20 percent of the Model 3s produced last week.  \u201cThey were borrowing people from our line all day to cover their (Model 3) breaks so the line would continue to move,\u201d said a Model S worker on Sunday.  Because of the focus on the Model 3, the S line is about 800 cars behind, the worker said.  \u201cThey\u2019ve been throwing Model 3s ahead of the S to get painted to try to assure that they make their goal of 5,000,\u201d the worker said. \u201cThe paint department can\u2019t handle the volume.\u201d  Disruption of the Model S and X lines could threaten Tesla\u2019s target of building 100,000 of those vehicles in 2018. Tesla built 49,489 of those cars in the first half of this year.  Asked about the potential S and X impact, Tesla said it also produced 1,913 of those vehicles during the last week of the quarter along with its Model 3s.  Tesla said it built a total of 28,578 Model 3s in the second quarter, and 40,989 since production began last July.  Last week\u2019s big push also brought a rewrite of the employee attendance policy. After mandatory weekend shifts were assigned, two workers said, Tesla rescinded a policy promising workers at least one week\u2019s notice before weekend work.  \u201cThe manager and supervisor are verbally going around and saying: \u2018If you don\u2019t come in, you\u2019ll be written up\u2019,\u201d one of the workers told Reuters last week.  Some employees are worried the frenetic pace plus long hours could burn out workers. One employee said they were told to keep working until they met their daily production mark, not when their shifts ended.  \u201cThey said starting tomorrow be prepared to work up to 12 hours,\u201d said the Model S employee on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be basically 12 hours from now on and I\u2019ve got a feeling it\u2019s gonna be six days a week.\u201d  To make its number, Tesla was willing to \u201cspend any kind of money,\u201d a Gigafactory worker said, pointing to the new battery assembly-line flown in from Europe via cargo planes to the Gigafactory in May.  In the morning of Sunday, July 1, about five hours after the self-imposed second-quarter deadline had passed, the number 5,000 flashed on a countdown screen viewed by Tesla\u2019s Model 3 assembly-line workers. The Model 3 itself bore a \u201c5,000\u201d sign in its front window.  Tesla said on Monday that some of its Model 3 production would be on break as part of the July 4 holiday, with production to resume on Thursday. Tesla plans to build 6,000 Model 3s per week by August.  But the worker told to expect longer shifts warned that pushing assembly-line workers too hard could backfire.  \u201cHe (Musk) is gonna go through an awful lot of people because people are gonna start getting hurt left and right,\u201d by the fast-moving assembly line, the worker said.  \u201cThere\u2019s only so fast a person can move.\u201d","1130":"FILE PHOTO: Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk talks at the Automotive World News Congress at the Renaissance Center in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 13, 2015.

It based that prediction, which would put the company\u2019s market capitalization at $1.3 trillion, in part on Tesla launching a fleet of profitable \u201crobotaxi\u201d autonomous cars.  Musk told investors last April that robotaxis with no human drivers would be available in some U.S. markets in 2020, a claim met with skepticism by experts who said the company\u2019s technology was nowhere near ready.

Panasonic first invested in Tesla in 2010 and announced its partnership in building the U.S. firm\u2019s Gigafactory plant in Nevada in 2014 as part of its strategic shift from low-margin consumer electronics to automotive components.  But as its $1.6 billion Gigafactory investment failed to produce solid returns, Panasonic has grown cautious about its battery business with Tesla.

The company\u2019s $1.38 billion convertible bond due in March 2021 also passed the same conversion rate.  The convertibles have oscillated between being in and out of the money several times over the last year.  They first rose above the conversion price in June 2017 and Tesla\u2019s stock price hit a record high of $389.61 in September last year. The stock then plunged to as low as $244.59 in April as the company struggled to meet production targets for its Model 3 sedan and Moody\u2019s Investors Service cut Tesla\u2019s credit rating deep into junk-bond territory.  Tesla on Aug. 1 reported that it had ended the second quarter with $2.78 billion in cash after spending $610 million in capital expenses, while its negative free cash flow narrowed.  Tesla has been burning through cash as manufacturing problems have thwarted its ability to meet production targets for its Model 3 sedan.  The company also has a $1.8 billion high-yield bonds, which rose to 92 cents on the dollar on Tuesday, up half a cent and the highest since mid-June. Following the Moody\u2019s downgrade, the bond had fallen to as low as 86.25 cents on the dollar. It now yields 6.75 percent versus more than 7.7 percent in early April.","1134":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The cost to insure debt holdings in electric carmaker Tesla Inc TSLA.O rose to its highest-ever level on Friday as the bond market reflected growing worries about a default, following the news that Chief Executive Elon Musk had been accused of fraud by federal regulators.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Tesla's 5-year credit default swap TSLA5YUSAX=MG hit its highest price ever on Friday, the day after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it was suing Musk and pushing for his ouster. The agency said he made a series of \"false and misleading\" tweets about potentially taking Tesla private last month.  Musk said on Thursday he had done nothing wrong. The company\u2019s shares were down 12.3 percent at $269.72 on Friday afternoon.  It costs about $71,300 to insure $1 million of the electric carmaker's debt, plus an upfront cost of around 22.45 percent, which was also at an all-time high, representing a total of 29.58 percent of the face value of the company's 2025 junk bond 88160RAE1=RRPS, or around $295,000.  Doubts were evident elsewhere in the market. Trading volume of the 2025 junk bond 88160RAE1=RRP ballooned to $34 million on Thursday, versus $6 million on Wednesday, $1 million on Tuesday and $7 million on Monday, according to Reuters trading sources. Traders were quoting the junk bond at 87 cents early on Thursday morning. As of Friday, it was at 84 cents on the dollar.  The volume surge and price drop suggest that sellers, who may have initially bought the bond because they believed in the company\u2019s fundamentals, capitulated on the price.  \u201cA lot of times a burst in volume means the seller gave in,\u201d said Tom Graff, portfolio manager at Brown Advisory.  Added Henry Peabody, portfolio manager at Eaton Vance: \u201cThe market financed a personality cult and the promise of growth. Those expectations now need to come out of the market.\u201d  Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.  Default risks are rising because Tesla faces the looming possibility of a cash shortage. If Tesla fails to meet production targets in the second half of 2018, it will need a different source of cash to pay for the $1.3 billion in debt it has coming due by March 2019. Credit investors think that without Musk, Tesla would have a harder time tapping debt or equity markets.  \u201cElon Musk is Tesla,\u201d said John McClain, portfolio manager at Diamond Hill. \u201cThis will limit their access to capital markets when they desperately need it.\u201d","1135":"BERLIN (Reuters) - Tesla Inc\u2019s CEO Elon Musk met with three German ministers and other senior politicians on Wednesday to discuss the progress of a collaboration between the car maker and a German biotech company and a planned electric vehicle factory.

On the sidelines of a conference of the parliamentary bloc in Berlin, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur also met economy minister Peter Altmaier, health minister Jens Spahn and research minister Anja Karliczek, but not Merkel.  Tesla is helping to build mobile molecule printers to make the potential COVID-19 vaccine under development by CureVac.  Last November, the U.S. electric carmaker announced plans to build a Gigafactory in Gruenheide in the eastern state of Brandenburg that surrounds Berlin.  Musk checked on the progress of that project, meeting earlier with Brandenburg state premier Dietmar Woidke.  \u201cIt was a very pleasant and focused conversation. Elon Musk is familiar with all the details of the Gruenheide Gigafactory,\u201d Woidke said in a statement.","1136":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk is coming close to earning the first $346 million tranche of options in a record-breaking pay package, after the electric vehicle maker\u2019s stock more than doubled in the last three months.  Shares of Tesla surged 9% to a record high on Monday. They need to rise another 6% to put Tesla\u2019s stock market value at $100 billion and then be sustained at that level for both a one-month and six-month average in order to trigger the vesting of the first of 12 tranches of options granted to Musk to buy Tesla stock.  Musk has already hit an operational target that is also necessary for the options to vest.  For Musk\u2019s subsequent tranches to vest under the terms of the 2018 package, the company\u2019s market cap would have to continue to sustainably rise by $50 billion increments over the agreement\u2019s 10-year period, with the billionaire earning the full package if Tesla\u2019s market capitalization reaches $650 billion and the electric car maker achieves several revenue and profit targets.  A full payoff for Musk, who is also the majority owner and CEO of the SpaceX rocket maker, would surpass anything previously granted to U.S. executives, according Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisor that recommended investors reject the pay package deal at the time.  Musk receives no salary or cash bonus, only options that vest based on Tesla\u2019s market cap and milestones for growth.  \u201cThis is the very definition of pay for performance,\u201d said Ian Keas, senior director at Longnecker & Associates, an executive compensation consulting firm. \u201cBut is he the only individual that could serve in that seat as CEO and deliver that value to shareholders?

In 2018, Walt Disney CEO Robert Iger earned stock grants worth as much as $149.6 million, including awards related to Disney\u2019s purchase of film and television assets from Twenty-First Century Fox.  GRAPHIC: Tesla's rising market cap -  Musk has transformed Tesla from a niche car maker with production problems into the global leader in electric vehicles, with U.S. and Chinese factories. So far it has stayed ahead of more established rivals including BMW and Volkswagen.  Last week, Tesla\u2019s stock market value hit nearly $89 billion, eclipsing the sum of General Motors\u2019 and Ford\u2019s for the first time, fueled by a surprise third-quarter profit, progress at a new factory in China and better-than-expected car deliveries in the fourth quarter.  Many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth, however. More Wall Street analysts rate Tesla \u201csell\u201d than \u201cbuy,\u201d and the company\u2019s stock has been one of the most shorted on Wall Street.  Tesla was valued at about $53 billion when shareholders approved the pay package in January 2018 and faced a cash crunch, production delays and increasing competition from rivals. It was viewed as massively ambitious because it implied the company\u2019s value could grow as much as ten-fold in 10 years.  Last year, Musk hit two operational milestones, pulling in revenue above $20 billion and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of $1.5 billion over four straight quarters. Tesla\u2019s \u201cadjusted\u201d EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation, which in the first nine months of 2019 reached $617 million.  Musk currently owns about 34 million Tesla shares, equivalent to 19% of the company. His compensation package would let him buy another 20.3 million shares if all of his options vest.  When Tesla first unveiled Musk\u2019s package in 2018, it said Musk could in theory reap as much as $55.8 billion if no new shares were issued. Tesla has since awarded stock to employees and last year sold $2.7 billion in shares and convertible bonds.","1137":"BEIJING\/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla Inc has started delivering Model 3 cars in China slightly ahead of schedule, as it looks to revive its sales that have been hit hard by Sino-U.S. trade tensions.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The California-based firm has already adjusted prices and added a cheaper Model 3 variant to its line-up to make its U.S.-made cars more affordable in China amid high import tariffs.  The U.S. luxury electric vehicle said in a statement that it held a delivery event in Beijing on Friday which \u201cmarked a significant milestone for the market\u201d.  It had initially projected a March start for Model 3 deliveries in China - the world\u2019s biggest auto market where overall car sales contracted in 2018 for the first time in more than two decades.  The initial deliveries will go to customers who placed their orders before the end of 2018, Tesla said. Buyers that ordered this year will start receiving their cars from end-March.  \u201cI see its earlier-than-expected delivery as an effort to try and seize the market as quickly as possible\u201d amid mounting competition, said Alan Kang, an analyst at LMC Automotive.  \u201cMany of its potential customers will not only be considering Tesla\u2019s Model 3 but also other electric car models like Jaguar\u2019s I-PACE or that from Audi and Mercedes-Benz,\u201d the Shanghai-based analyst added.  While auto sales in China have waned as the economy slowed, Tesla\u2019s business was hit hard after Beijing raised tariffs on U.S. auto imports to 40 percent in July amid the trade tensions. China has since temporarily suspended the additional 25 percent tariff, reducing it to the 15 percent level.  Tesla currently imports all the cars it sells in China, but is in the process of building a factory in Shanghai that will manufacture Model 3 cars in the initial phase and help it minimize the impact of the trade war.  The United States and China are in the midst of talks aimed at resolving their trade dispute. If the two sides fail to reach an agreement by March 1, U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports are set to spike to 25 percent from 10 percent.  Tit-for-tat tariffs between the world\u2019s two top economies have upended international trade flows.  Tesla\u2019s earlier-than-scheduled delivery, however, comes as the automaker was dealt a setback on Thursday after Consumer Reports, an influential U.S. magazine, withdrew its endorsement for Model 3, citing reliability problems.  The magazine\u2019s decision to withdraw its endorsement, less than nine months after recommending the electric sedan, raised questions about quality that Tesla has faced since the Model 3\u2019s difficult launch.","1138":"(Reuters) - Elon Musk's rocket company, SpaceX, could help fund a bid to take electric car company Tesla Inc TSLA.O private, the New York Times reported on Thursday, quoting people familiar with the matter.  Musk startled Wall Street last week when he said in a tweet he was considering taking the auto company private for $420 per share and that funding was \u201csecured.\u201d He has since said he is searching for funds for the effort.  Musk said on Monday that the manager of Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund had voiced support for the company going private several times, including as recently as two weeks ago, but also said that talks continue with the fund and other investors.  The New York Times report said another possibility under consideration is that SpaceX would help bankroll the Tesla privatization and would take an ownership stake in the carmaker, according to people familiar with the matter.  Musk is the CEO and controlling shareholder of the rocket company.  Tesla and SpaceX did not respond when Reuters requested comment on the matter.  In a wide-ranging and emotional interview with the New York Times published late on Thursday, Musk, Tesla's chief executive, described the difficulties over the last year for him as the company has tried to overcome manufacturing issues with the Model 3 sedan. nyti.ms\/2vOkgeM  \u201cThis past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was excruciating.\u201d  The loss-making company has been trying to hit production targets, but the tweet by Musk opened up a slew of new problems including government scrutiny and lawsuits.

REUTERS\/Aaron P. Bernstein  The New York Times report said efforts are underway to find a No. 2 executive to help take some of the pressure off Musk, people briefed on the search said.  Musk has no plans to relinquish his dual role as chairman and chief executive officer, he said in the interview.  Musk said he wrote the tweet regarding taking Tesla private as he drove himself on the way to the airport in his Tesla Model S. He told the New York Times that no one reviewed the tweet before he posted it.  He said that he wanted to offer a roughly 20 percent premium over where the stock had been recently trading, which would have been about $419. He decided to round up to $420 - a number that has become code for marijuana in counterculture lore, the report said.  \u201cIt seemed like better karma at $420 than at $419,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cBut I was not on weed, to be clear. Weed is not helpful for productivity. There\u2019s a reason for the word \u2018stoned.\u2019 You just sit there like a stone on weed,\u201d he said.  Some board members recently told Musk to lay off Twitter and rather focus on operations at his companies, according to people familiar with the matter, the newspaper report said.  During the interview, Musk emotionally described the intensity of running his businesses. He told the newspaper that he works 120 hours a week, sometimes at the expense of not celebrating his own birthday or spending only a few hours at his brother\u2019s wedding.  \u201cThere were times when I didn\u2019t leave the factory for three or four days \u2014 days when I didn\u2019t go outside,\u201d he said during the interview. \u201cThis has really come at the expense of seeing my kids. And seeing friends.\u201d  To help sleep, Musk sometimes takes Ambien, which concerns some board members, since he has a tendency to conduct late-night Twitter sessions, according to a person familiar with the board the New York Times reported.  \u201cIt is often a choice of no sleep or Ambien,\u201d he said.","1139":"WASHINGTON\/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O Chief Executive Elon Musk took to Twitter on Thursday to call on U.S. President Donald Trump to challenge China's auto trade rules, which limit foreign ownership of Chinese ventures and impose steep tariffs on imported cars.

REUTERS\/Aaron P. Bernstein\/File Photo  In a series of tweets aimed at the president, Musk said he was \u201cagainst import duties in general, but the current rules make things very difficult. It\u2019s like competing in an Olympic race wearing lead shoes.\u201d  Tesla has been pushing hard to build cars in China, the world\u2019s largest auto market, but has hit roadblocks in negotiations with local authorities, in part because Musk is keen to keep full control of any local venture.  \u201cNo U.S. auto company is allowed to own even 50 percent of their own factory in China, but there are five 100 percent China-owned EV (electric vehicle) auto companies in the U.S.,\u201d Musk wrote in another tweet.  Tesla \u201craised this with the prior administration and nothing happened. Just want a fair outcome, ideally where tariffs\/rules are equally moderate. Nothing more. Hope this does not seem unreasonable,\u201d he said.  Trump quoted one of Musk\u2019s tweets in his announcement on new tariffs and said American automakers have not been treated fairly by trade rules around the world. Trump announced steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on Thursday.  Politicians \u201chave known it for years and never did anything about it. It\u2019s got to change,\u201d Trump said, saying he plans to impose a \u201creciprocal tax\u201d on other countries. \u201cWe\u2019re changing things,\u201d Trump added. \u201cWe just want fairness.\u201d  Tesla has sought to build a factory in the Chinese financial capital of Shanghai, and last November Musk said he hoped the plant would be operating within three years. However, Tesla and Chinese authorities have yet to announce an agreement.  The Shanghai Municipal Commission of Commerce did not immediately respond to calls and faxed requests for comment. Telsa officials in China declined to comment.  China has said it will look to lower import taxes for cars and carry out a pilot scheme to loosen foreign ownership rules for new energy vehicles, a term China uses to refer to fully-electric and plug-in hybrid cars.  FAIR OUTCOME?  Late Thursday, Musk struck a more hopeful tone. \u201cTo be clear, I think a fair outcome for all is quite likely. China has already shown a willingness to open their markets and I believe they will do the right thing,\u201d he said on Twitter.  Tesla shares closed down 1 percent on Thursday and were off nearly another percent in after-market trading.  China, which is making a major push toward electric cars, requires foreign automakers to build factories in 50-50 joint ventures with domestic Chinese automakers and not allowed them to establish wholly owned factories.  Trump told Reuters in an interview in January that \u201cwe have helped to build China because they have taken out so much money in terms of trade deficits with this country.\u201d  He added that \u201cwhen China or another country charges us 50 percent tariffs \u2013 more than that in some cases \u2013 and we charge them nothing, that\u2019s not fair. That\u2019s not fair.\u201d  China levies a 25 percent duty on sales of imported vehicles. Those are problems for Tesla, which wants to expand its presence in China\u2019s growing electric vehicle market without compromising its independence or intellectual property.  Musk noted that a U.S. car \u201cgoing to China pays 25 percent import duty, but a Chinese car coming to the US only pays 2.5 percent, a tenfold difference.\u201d He asked Trump: \u201cDo you think the US & China should have equal & fair rules for cars? Meaning, same import duties, ownership constraints & other factors.\u201d  Trump said the United States plans to charge countries a \u201cmirror tax\u201d for what American products face.  Musk has met with Trump on several occasions since his election in November 2016. In June 2017, Musk withdrew from a pair of White House advisory councils after Trump said he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord.","1140":"SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - An employee fired from Tesla Inc\u2019s Nevada battery factory filed a whistleblower complaint with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, accusing the company of spying on employees and failing to act after learning that a Mexican cartel may be dealing drugs inside the plant, his attorney said on Thursday.  A former member of Tesla\u2019s internal investigations team, Karl Hansen, filed a tips, complaints and referrals form to the SEC about the Gigafactory on Aug. 9, Hansen\u2019s attorney Stuart Meissner said in a news release. Whistleblowers can receive 10 percent to 30 percent of penalties the SEC collects.  Tesla said it took the allegations that Hansen brought to the electric car maker seriously and investigated.  \u201cSome of his claims are outright false. Others could not be corroborated,\u201d Tesla said in the statement.  The SEC declined comment.  The complaint sent to the SEC comes amid intense focus on the company and Chief Executive Elon Musk, whose tweets about taking the company private last week set off a scramble to determine whether he violated securities law in stating that funding for the deal was \u201csecured.\u201d  Hansen alleged that Tesla, at the direction of Musk, installed surveillance equipment at the Gigafactory outside Reno, Nevada to eavesdrop on the personal cellphones of employees while at work, according to Meissner.  Hansen also claims that Tesla did not disclose to investors that thieves stole $37 million in copper and other raw materials during the first half of 2018, according to his attorney.  Hansen alleges Tesla failed to disclose that it received written notice from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration about a Tesla employee possibly engaged in selling cocaine and crystal methamphetamine from the Nevada factory on behalf of a Mexican drug cartel, according to Meissner who did not release the whistleblower filing he said his client made to the SEC.  Reuters could not reach Hansen for comment.  Hansen alleges that he found ties between the Tesla employee and members of the cartel and urged Tesla to disclose that information to the DEA, his attorney said in the news release.  The DEA did not immediately have a comment.  Sheriff Gerald Antinoro of Storey County, where the Gigafactory is located, declined to comment on the allegations of drug dealing. The sheriff did say Tesla reported two thefts but did not disclose what was taken.  \u201cTesla refused to do so and instead advised him that Tesla would hire \u2018outside vendors\u2019 to further investigate the issue,\u201d Meissner said in the news release.  Hansen was subject to retaliation and fired on July 16 after raising the issues internally, he said.  Hansen is the second Tesla employee to file a whistleblower complaint with the SEC.  Martin Tripp, another former Gigafactory worker represented by Meissner, told the SEC that Tesla inflated the number of Model 3s being produced each week, that it used punctured batteries in its vehicles, and that it reused scrapped parts in vehicles \u201cwithout regard to safety,\u201d according to his attorney.  Tesla denies those claims.  Tripp\u2019s tip to the SEC was filed after he was fired, sued by Tesla for hacking trade secrets and transferring internal documents to third parties.

Explaining his reversal in a late-night blog post on Friday, the billionaire CEO said that taking the company private \u201cwould be even more time-consuming and distracting than initially anticipated,\u201d and that \u201cmost of Tesla\u2019s existing shareholders believe we are better off as a public company.\u201d  It was on Aug. 7 that Musk first surprised investors with his plan by tweeting that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d for a go-private deal, which would have had a value of $72 billion. In a separate tweet, he wrote: \u201cInvestor support is confirmed.\u201d  Musk and Tesla are facing investor lawsuits and a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the truthfulness of the CEO\u2019S Aug. 7 tweets, according to an Aug. 8 report by the Wall Street Journal.  The SEC declined to confirm that report to Reuters. A Tesla spokesman declined to comment.  \u201cThe SEC will continue its investigation until it\u2019s satisfied that it is on top of the facts,\u201d said Stephen Crimmins, an attorney with Murphy & McGonigle who spent 14 years at the SEC, where he prosecuted hundreds of securities cases.  \u201cWhat happened on Friday will be of interest to the SEC because it will allow them to probe whether Musk\u2019s pulling back from the go-private somehow indicates that he did not have a reasonable basis for his statement. They will be asking questions of him and others involved in the decision as to why he reversed course.\u201d  Musk has stuck to his original statement that he believed a deal was possible, and one person familiar with the discussions told Reuters that Musk was serious about taking the carmaker private.  But acting in good faith may not be enough to help Musk escape the regulator\u2019s gaze.  U.S. securities law requires public company executives to have a \u201creasonable basis\u201d on which to make representations to the investing public, and that would likely be the focus of an SEC probe, said three securities lawyers.  It remains unclear what Musk meant by \u201cfunding secured.\u201d In an Aug. 13 statement, Musk said that he left a July 31 meeting with the managing director of Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund \u201cwith no question that a deal ... could be closed.\u201d  The Saudi fund had earlier acquired a just-below 5 percent stake in Tesla on the open market. But the fund has made no comment on whether it had promised to back a much larger Tesla go-private deal.  \u2018FUNDING SECURED\u2019  Musk said on Friday he believed there was plenty of potential funding to take the company private, but he did not provide any further details to bolster his \u201cfunding secured\u201d assertion.  Teresa Goody, CEO of law firm Goody Counsel and a former SEC attorney, said Musk\u2019s statement on Friday appeared to undermine his Aug. 7 tweet that investor support was confirmed.  She also raised concerns about a second comment Musk made on Friday, where he said it had become apparent that compliance restrictions would prevent many of Tesla\u2019s institutional shareholders from holding private Tesla equity.  Both statements are likely to raise further questions among SEC officials as to whether Musk had performed sufficient due diligence to have had a reasonable basis for his Aug. 7 tweets, she said.  Another statement in the blog that could catch the eye of SEC officials is Musk\u2019s reference to his discussion with Tesla\u2019s board on Thursday, during which both parties decided not to pursue the deal, said M. Ridgway Barker, a partner and chair of the corporate finance practice at law firm Withersworldwide.  Such discussions are unlikely to be subject to legal privilege and the SEC could subpoena minutes of the meeting, he said.  \u201cIf the board discussion included that the deal is not financeable, or prohibitively expensive, that is going to cast further doubt over Musk\u2019s claims,\u201d he said.

With a market capitalization now at $590 billion, Tesla is the most valuable company ever admitted to the S&P 500.","1144":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc\u2019s sudden decision to shutter the bulk of its stores around the world raises a red flag over the future of its solar branch, a declining business it paid $2.6 billion for in a controversial 2016 deal.  FILE PHOTO: A SolarCity vehicle is shown in San Diego, California, U.S., November 2, 2016. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Chief Executive Elon Musk\u2019s announcement on Thursday that the electric vehicle maker would close \u201cmany\u201d of its stores around the world to sell cars online-only removes the only retail outlet for solar sales since Musk pulled the plug on a partnership with Home Depot last June.  \u201cSolar is now the stepchild at Tesla. They\u2019ve made two decisions in a row that deal crippling blows to the solar business and they may be regretting the Home Depot idea,\u201d said Frank Gillett, principal analyst at Forrester Research.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel thoughtfully done, it\u2019s rushed. Basically it will hurt them from a brand and marketing point of view,\u201d Gillett said.  When Tesla made its offer for SolarCity - a debt-laden solar-panel sales and installation company founded by two of Musk\u2019s cousins - its stock price was down 70 percent from its all-time high. Musk cast the deal as a \u201cno-brainer\u201d rife with synergies, in which customers could be sold both cars and solar energy systems.  That has not yet proven to be the case, and Tesla\u2019s solar business has been shrinking as selling the Model 3 sedan became Tesla\u2019s priority. As part of company-wide layoffs last June, Tesla closed about a dozen solar installation facilities.  Tesla said all sales for its energy and solar products around the world would now be online only, too. The company says that roughly 75 percent of its current solar sales volume is generated outside of its retail stores via the web or referrals.  \u201cThe majority of our residential solar and Powerwall orders are already placed outside our retail stores, including online or via referral, and we believe this shift to online sales, paired with a dedicated energy adviser from our support team, will result in the best, most seamless customer experience in the industry,\u201d a Tesla spokesman told Reuters.  Tesla cited a cut in prices of its residential solar systems by as much as 25 percent in November, representing savings of between $3,000-$5,000 on average, helped by streamlining its sales operations, and said the shift to online sales would unlock additional cost efficiencies.  Ending the deal with Home Depot, whose stores generate high foot traffic, took a huge bite out of Tesla solar sales. In the fourth quarter, the company deployed 73 megawatts of retrofit solar systems, down 21 percent from the prior quarter and well below SolarCity\u2019s more than 200 megawatts a quarter in early 2016. Total energy generation and storage revenue fell 7 percent from the prior quarter to $371.5 million.  Besides selling private-label and third-party solar panels, Tesla sells energy storage systems for home and business use, so-called Powerwalls and Powerpacks. Tesla has said nearly all Powerwall-only orders are placed via the web or certain third-party solar installers.  Installations of the solar roof tiles unveiled by Musk in 2016 are at a \u201cslow pace,\u201d Tesla said in its 2018 annual report, due to design changes. Progress at Tesla\u2019s solar factory in Buffalo, New York, where the tiles are to be manufactured, meanwhile, has been stalled by assembly-line problems.  One former solar seller laid off in January told Reuters that 70 percent of leads on solar had come from Home Depot. Upper management at Tesla \u201cdidn\u2019t appreciate the significance\u201d of the deal with the big-box retailer, the source said.  \u201cIf you want to go mass volume, you have to go after the customers,\u201d the source said. \u201cSolar isn\u2019t sexy enough to have the customer come to you.\u201d  Musk said Tesla will still keep open a small number of stores in high-traffic locations as galleries and information centers, where details about energy products will also be offered.  When customers order a car on Tesla\u2019s website, they are alerted during the configuration process to the possibility of ordering solar or other energy products.  In January, Tesla said it was \u201cstill in the process of transitioning our sales channel from former partners to our Tesla stores and training our sales team to sell solar systems in addition to vehicles.\u201d  But former solar salespeople told Reuters that Tesla had already put solar on the back burner, with Tesla-branded panels not even available for installations in the latter half of 2018.  \u201cThey\u2019d tell us the focus of the company is the Model 3,\u201d said one former seller, who left the company in January. \u201cThe Model 3 has to be successful or there\u2019s no company.\u201d","1145":"(Repeats SEPT 3 story, no change to text)  * Electric vehicles: Sales forecast tmsnrt.rs\/2PuORFo  * Electric vehicles: Market share tmsnrt.rs\/2PvahlT  STOCKHOLM\/PARIS, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Mercedes-Benz is set to unveil its much-anticipated electric SUV on Tuesday, marking the start of a German onslaught against Tesla\u2019s dominance of the fast-growing market for premium battery cars.  Daimler-owned Mercedes, BMW and Volkswagen\u2019s Audi and Porsche divisions are all gunning for the $52 billion Californian upstart, with early publicity efforts emulating its tech-industry halo.  The market for upscale electric cars is Tesla\u2019s to lose, with sales of its entry-level Model 3 sedan expected to reach about 50,000 cars this year and almost double that in 2019.  The Mercedes EQC - whose launch programme in Stockholm features yoga in a direct appeal to the Millennials who have flocked to Tesla - is the first production model under the carmaker\u2019s electric EQ sub-brand. It will be closely followed by similarly hyped debuts for BMW and Audi.  \u201cWhile Tesla currently has a strong hold on the luxury electric market, I don\u2019t think this will be the case after the arrival of the German premium offerings,\u201d said Wajih Hossenally, an automotive powertrain analyst with IHS Markit.  \u201cTesla has virtually zero competition - but this will change from 2019 onwards.\u201d  Rival forecaster LMC Automotive agrees, predicting a steady decline in Tesla\u2019s share of an exploding electric-car market over the next decade, from today\u2019s 12.3 percent to 2.8 percent, even as its absolute sales continue to rise.  The Germans\u2019 combined market share will surpass Tesla\u2019s to reach 11.8 percent in 2020 before increasing further to about 19 percent three years later, according to its projections.  The new Mercedes, due to reach its first customers next year, will be priced close to the fuel-burning GLC to compete in the same bracket as Tesla\u2019s $49,000 Model 3, helped by its hotter-selling SUV form.  An affordable Model Y SUV is slated to join Tesla\u2019s high-end Model X crossover and Model S car, but not before 2020-21.  TECH BUZZ  The EQC softens its higher-riding proportions with sporty curves and a distinctive full-width rear light, while the interior resembles that of the Mercedes C-Class - a reminder of economies of scale that electric-only Tesla cannot match.  Well aware that their earlier battery-car offerings have failed to get anything like Tesla\u2019s level of public attention, the German brands are doggedly courting Silicon Valley-style buzz for the coming product blitz.  Executives including Mercedes Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche have taken to appearing in jeans and sneakers, responding to a broader tech-industry incursion into areas such as autonomous driving and connected services.  When it came to the EQC launch, Mercedes picked the city of Stockholm for its startup scene and green credentials, then began firing off teasers on Instagram as well as Twitter.  Like Tesla, Mercedes is announcing EQC orders in Norway even before its price. It has amassed more than 2,000 refundable deposits of 20,000 crowns ($2,400) in Europe\u2019s biggest electric-car market, where Tesla sold 8,500 vehicles last year.  The launch is the centrepiece of a three-day event that features DJ sets and yoga with a YouTube star - almost literally bending over backwards to telegraph 21st-century kudos.  Audi on Monday began production of its e-Tron SUV ahead of a Sept. 17 sales launch jamboree in San Francisco, just 40 miles from Tesla\u2019s Fremont assembly plant. It also plans to begin taking reservations backed by refundable $1,000 deposits.  The e-Tron is due in showrooms early next year, followed in 2020 by two more electric Audis and the Porsche Taycan sports car from its Volkswagen Group stablemate.  WOW FACTOR  Not to be outdone, BMW has hired a Lufthansa cargo jet to fly its electric Vision iNext - still just a concept car - from Munich to Beijing via New York and, of course, San Francisco. Events are planned in all four cities over five days.  In another Tesla-inspired move, the three German carmakers are developing their own network of fast-chargers along major highways in a partnership with Ford.  While some experts doubt the Germans can ever match the wow factor around Tesla and its founding boss Elon Musk, many also wonder whether they need to.  \u201cGerman manufacturers have highly desirable, fun-to-drive premium cars in their DNA,\u201d said Nicolai Mueller, a McKinsey partner based in Cologne. \u201cThat\u2019s a very good starting point.\u201d  Tesla used its powerful tech aura to persuade early adopters to pay a premium for an all-electric car from a relative unknown, with no quality track-record or physical dealerships for servicing and support.  But the German carmakers have a century of manufacturing behind them, with sterling brands, well developed global sales networks and an existing customer base in the millions.  BMW\u2019s i3 mini and an earlier Audi e-Tron failed to shift large volumes, but the electric-car market has matured since. LMC sees China driving global sales growth above 50 percent annually as the German offensive gets underway in 2019-20.  By then the Model S flagship will be eight years old. Musk, by tweeting then withdrawing plans to take Tesla private, has sharpened doubts about the company\u2019s ability to keep expanding and updating its lineup.  \u201cTesla is potentially facing a product shortfall starting in 2020,\u201d Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois warned investors in a note last week.  Tyler Martin, a Tesla owner in Tucson, Arizona, said he had yet to decide whether to buy a Model 3 next - after his current Model S suffered from \u201cbuild quality\u201d issues requiring several trips to the repair shop each year.  One big question is whether competitors can offer a viable alternative to Tesla\u2019s proprietary fast-charging network, the 28-year-old software entrepreneur said.  If they can, Martin added, \u201cI would definitely consider another brand.\u201d","1146":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers introduced legislation on Wednesday to expand the electric vehicle tax credit by 400,000 vehicles per manufacturer, a provision that would give a boost to Tesla Inc and General Motors Co before the existing credit comes to an end for them.  FILE PHOTO: A 2019 Chevrolet Bolt plug-in electric vehicle is displayed at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 15, 2019. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook\/File Photo  The bill is sponsored by Democratic Senators Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, Republican Senators Lamar Alexander and Susan Collins and Democratic Representative Dan Kildee.  The bill could lift electric vehicle sales in a boost for automakers that have committed tens of billions of dollars toward meeting global emissions requirements.  GM and Tesla shares rose on Reuters report that the bill would be introduced. Tesla shares recently traded up nearly 1 percent, while GM was up 0.2 percent.  Supporters hope to attach the proposal to tax legislation that could be considered in the next few months.  The existing $7,500 EV tax credit, which allows taxpayers to deduct part of the cost of buying an electric car, phases out over 15 months once an automaker hits 200,000 cumulative EV sales. GM saw its tax credit cut to $3,750 on April 1. Tesla\u2019s tax credit fell to $3,750 on Jan. 1 and will end entirely at year\u2019s end.  The bill dubbed the \u201cDriving America Forward Act\u201d would grant each automaker a $7,000 tax credit for an additional 400,000 vehicles on top of the existing 200,000 vehicles eligible for $7,500 tax credits. It would shorten the phase-out schedule to nine months.  The bill would also extend the hydrogen fuel cell credit through 2028. The bill is estimated to cost $11.4 billion, with all but $91 million of that tally to extend the EV tax credit.  \u201cWe have a cap that\u2019s got to go up,\u201d Stabenow told a group of automakers at a dinner last week. \u201cI want to get this done as soon as possible.\u201d  The proposal has strong backing from automakers, environmental groups and others, but will face opposition.  Last month, the White House proposed immediately eliminating the $7,500 tax credit, a move it said would save the U.S. government $2.5 billion over a decade.  Senator John Barrasso, a Republican who chairs the Environment and Public Works Committee, in February proposed legislation to end the credit and impose a highway user fee on EVs to pay for road repairs.  The bill is backed by major automakers including GM, Tesla, Toyota Motor Corp, Ford Motor Co, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Honda Motor Co, BMW AG, Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG and utilities.  GM President Mark Reuss said in a statement \u201cthe EV tax credit provides customers with a proven incentive as we work to establish the U.S. as a leader in electrification.\u201d  Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said \u201cas we build and grow the clean energy economy, we must continue to invest in tackling the sector that generates the most pollution: transportation.\u201d  Both GM and Tesla have been lobbying Congress for more than a year to extend or expand the EV tax credit.  GM\u2019s credit drops to $1,875 in October and will completely disappear by April 2020, while Tesla\u2019s credit falls to $1,875 in July and expires at the end of the year.","1147":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O on Wednesday surprised investors with a quarterly profit that sent its shares soaring, as Chief Executive Elon Musk promised a 2020 rollout of a cheaper SUV and more self-driving technology to stay ahead of larger rivals rushing into the premium electric vehicle market he created.  Shares rose nearly 21% to $307.12 after hours on the unexpected news, crossing $300 for the first time since March 1 after record deliveries and cost cuts ensured a profitable third quarter.  Tesla on Wednesday posted a cash balance increase to $5.3 billion and reported a profit of $1.86 per share, shattering analyst expectations for a loss of 42 cents per share.  The third-quarter results are an important milestone for Tesla and redemption for Musk who had to step down as chairman after a series of scandals and investor doubts about Tesla\u2019s ability to withstand competition from larger, better capitalized global rivals.  Tesla\u2019s gross margins, an important profit indicator for investors, surpassed expectations and Tesla said it was \u201chighly confident\u201d in exceeding the low end of its yearly global vehicle delivery goal.  But Tesla has yet to prove that it can be consistently profitable while managing the start of production for Model 3 sedans at its new factory in Shanghai and for Model Y sport utilities next year.  \u201cGiven the breakneck speed of expansion, Tesla will face significant demands on its cash pile,\u201d said Nicholas Hyett, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.  The company on Wednesday said production in Shanghai and for Model Y are ahead of schedule, with the latter expected to launch by the summer of 2020.  Tesla also has to contain costs as it develops a gigafactory in Europe, a Semi truck, an electric pickup truck, a new generation of the Tesla Roadster and automated driving features.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The carmaker said it had cut costs 16% on a yearly basis, citing improvements in operating efficiency and a reduction in manufacturing and material costs. Musk said on a conference call that operating costs were the lowest since Model 3 production started.  Margin expectations are higher for Model Y than Model 3, while productions costs are roughly the same as Model 3, said Zach Kirkhorn, Tesla chief financial officer.  Model 3 vehicles made in the Shanghai factory will have roughly the same margins as those made in Fremont, California, he said.  Tesla also expects to generally be cash flow positive as it has grown to the point of being self-funding. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/2MF6HHq)  That will allow the company to invest in divisions focusing on sustainable energy, including launching the third version of its solar roof tile this week.  \u201cFor about a year and a half we stripped Tesla energy of resources,\u201d Musk said. \u201cNow that Model 3 production is in a good place and headed to a great place we have restored resources to Tesla storage and solar. That\u2019s going to be really crazy growth.\u201d  Musk also said Tesla is open to supplying batteries and other components to other automakers.  With Wednesday\u2019s after-hours surge, Tesla\u2019s stock has reduced its loss year-to-date to 8% and added about $9 billion to its market capitalization.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  But Tesla rallies have been short-lived before.  A year ago, Tesla gave a quarterly report that similarly smashed investors' expectations, igniting a rally that sent its shares 31% higher over the next two months, only to see the stock decline through much of 2019 over worries about corporate governance, profitability and demand for the Model 3. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/2PgxXgT)  Investors in the past have shown impatience with the company\u2019s serial failures to meet financial and production targets. Earlier this month, Tesla shares slumped after the company reported delivering 97,000 vehicles for the third quarter, only 2% ahead of the previous quarter.  But Tesla on Wednesday exceeded promises by billionaire Musk, who in July said Tesla would break even in the third quarter and turn a profit by the end of 2019.  The company has said it plans to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles for all of 2019, and on Wednesday said it was \u201chighly confident in exceeding 360,000 deliveries this year.\u201d  Analysts have questioned how rapidly Tesla\u2019s vehicle sales will grow as government subsidies for electric vehicle purchases dwindle in the United States, China and other markets.  Kirkhorn on Wednesday said Tesla saw growing order rates in all markets, with current quarter orders exceeding those of the past three months.  Tesla has said it aims to produce at least 1,000 Model 3 cars a week at the new Chinese factory by the end of this year, but it is unclear when it will meet year-end production targets due to uncertainties around orders, labor and suppliers.  Revenue fell nearly 8% to $6.30 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts had expected revenue of $6.33 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Tesla on Wednesday said it would gradually release nearly $500 million of accumulated revenue tied to its \u201cfull self-driving capabilities\u201d, which customers can buy for $6,000 even though fully automated driving is not available.  Kirkhorn on Wednesday said deferred revenue would also be released as Tesla expands its \u201cSmart Summon\u201d feature, which allows customers to operate a Tesla from 200 feet (60 meters) away using a smartphone app.  Federal safety regulators are looking into the feature after videos began appearing online showing driverless Teslas hitting obstacles or nearly hitting other vehicles.  Musk on Wednesday said software updates over the coming weeks would improve Summon.","1148":"BEIJING, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Friday it plans to start delivering Model 3 cars to customers in China in March, cementing a time frame that the U.S. electric vehicle maker\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, tweeted about late last year.  The California-based firm, which aims to accelerate Chinese sales that have been hit hard by the impact of trade tension between Washington and Beijing, said in a statement the starting price for a Model 3 in China would be 499,000 yuan ($72,000).  Tesla cut prices for its Model 3 last month, the third time in the last two months for the firm to adjust prices in China.  In November, Tesla cut the prices of its Model X and Model S in China by 12 to 26 percent.

The logo of Tesla is seen at a Tesla Supercharger station in Dietikon, Switzerland October 21, 2020. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self Driving\u201d software would be an important source of revenue, once it is fully deployed. Tesla owners have paid $8,000 up front in hopes of eventually receiving the upgrade. In the second quarter alone, Tesla recognized $48 million of FSD deferred revenue. Tesla reports third-quarter results after the New York market closes on Wednesday.  WHAT DOES \u2018SELF-DRIVING\u2019 MEAN?  The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and most automakers define five levels of automation here Levels 0 to 2 include features such as automated braking systems (ABS) and lane departure warnings that need to be supervised by a driver. Liability for vehicle behaviour rests with the vehicle owner rather than the manufacturer.  Several automakers say they are ready to deploy Level 3 systems that automate highway driving, but require drivers to remain ready to take control.  IS TESLA CAPABLE OF AUTONOMOUS DRIVING ANYWHERE?  No. Tesla has said its system is only capable of functioning on highways.  Tesla\u2019s Autopilot has been criticized by the National Transportation Safety Board for allowing drivers to turn their attention from the road, leading to deadly accidents.  European crash test officials at European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) gave Tesla's Model 3 a \"moderate\" rating here and said the name Autopilot is inappropriate since it suggests full automation.  German courts have banned Tesla from repeating misleading claims about the car\u2019s self-driving capabilities.  The United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which awarded Tesla the highest safety score for occupant safety, has investigated 15 crashes since 2016 involving Tesla vehicles equipped with Autopilot.  WHEN WILL TESLA LAUNCH ROBOTAXIS?  In April 2019, Musk said fleets of self-driving robotaxis would be on roads by 2020.  On Sept. 22, 2020, during the company\u2019s \u201cBattery Day\u201d presentation, Musk admitted that Autopilot software was undergoing a \u201cfundamental rewrite.\u201d  WHAT SYSTEM DOES TESLA CURRENTLY USE?  Tesla uses eight cameras, radar and ultrasonic sensors to enable its vehicles to navigate streets. It opted against using Lidar, a sensor that Audi and Mercedes say is vital to corroborate information gathered by cameras. \u201cAnyone who is relying on Lidar is doomed. Doomed,\u201d Musk said last year.  HOW IS SELF-DRIVING TECHNOLOGY REGULATED?  Technology to automate highway driving, parking and navigation in stop-and-go traffic is being deployed in an absence of industry-wide standards.  Article 8 of the 1968 Convention on Road Traffic states: \u201cEvery driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle or to guide his animals.\u201d  Lawmakers across the globe have worked to incorporate a little-noticed amendment to the United Nations Convention on Road Traffic agreed in 2014, into national rules. This would let drivers take their hands off the wheel of self-driving cars.  The U.S. states of Nevada and Arizona passed laws to allow test drives of autonomous vehicles there. Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google tested a car in Nevada in 2012 and in October said it will start offering rides to the public in robotaxi minivans in Phoenix.  California also allows limited testing of driverless autonomous vehicles.  Mercedes-Benz is now getting ready to launch a Level 3 system in Germany next year, once German law allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel for extended periods of time.","1151":"LOS ANGELES\/TOKYO (Reuters) - Most of the solar cells made by Panasonic at Tesla Inc\u2019s New York manufacturing plant are being purchased by H.R.D. Singapore\u2019s factories in the Philippines, a chief supplier of panels to Japanese eco-homebuilder Ichijo Co Ltd, two sources familiar with the arrangement said.  Solar installers from Baker Electric place solar panels on the roof of a residential home in Scripps Ranch, San Diego, California, U.S. October 14, 2016. Picture taken October 14, 2016. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Reuters reported on May 15 that Panasonic planned to ship most cells from the plant overseas, instead of selling them to Tesla for its trademark Solar Roof as initially intended, because of low demand from Tesla and a trade loophole that had fired up new foreign interest. That loophole allows companies outside the United States to ship solar panels into America duty-free provided the panels are made with U.S.-built cells.  Until now, the identity of the buyer of the Panasonic cells, which Panasonic is producing at the Tesla facility under an agreement struck in 2016, has not been published.  The demand for U.S. solar cells abroad is striking because there are very few American producers and the components are typically far cheaper when sourced in Asia, reflecting the lengths to which some companies would go to sidestep President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on solar imports. It was unclear what H.R.D. and Ichijo\u2019s plans were for the Panasonic cells.  The export of the cells also underscores the depths of Tesla\u2019s troubles in the U.S. solar business, which the electric car maker acquired in 2016 with its $2.6 billion purchase of SolarCity, but which has been shrinking since.  The sources said H.R.D.\u2019s factories in the Philippines were now taking the lion\u2019s share of the solar cells from the Buffalo plant, presumably to assemble them into solar panels. They did not provide estimates on the volume or value of the cells going to H.R.D., saying only the shipments accounted for most of the cell production from the facility.  H.R.D.\u2019s factories primarily supply Ichijo, a company to which H.R.D. is closely affiliated, according to posts by Ichijo on social media. Ichijo markets its homes as energy efficient and technology-focused, and many are offered with solar panels. The company had roughly $3.7 billion in sales last year focused mainly in the Japanese market, but for the past 10 years it has also been building in the United States Pacific Northwest.  Representatives from Panasonic, Tesla and H.R.D. declined to comment. An Ichijo official at the company\u2019s Japan headquarters also declined to comment.  Panasonic partnered with Tesla in 2016 to make solar cells, as well as full solar panels, at the Buffalo facility after Tesla inherited the plant in its acquisition of SolarCity.  The companies said Tesla would make a long-term commitment to buy the cells - key components in panels that convert the sun\u2019s light into electricity - to use them in Tesla\u2019s Solar Roof product.  LOW-CARBON LIFESTYLE  Musk had billed the Solar Roof, designed to look like conventional roof tiles, as a cornerstone of the company\u2019s strategy to sell a low-carbon lifestyle to eco-conscious consumers who could use the power from a Solar Roof to charge their Tesla electric vehicle.  But the company has installed them on just a handful of rooftops so far after production line troubles and a gutting of Tesla\u2019s solar sales team, according to Tesla sources. Tesla has not provided official sales figures for its Solar Roof.  Panasonic was forced to find other buyers due to low demand from Tesla, whose purchases of the cells have been sporadic, an employee at the Buffalo factory said. The automaker does not have an exclusive supply arrangement with Panasonic.  Panasonic said in a filing with the U.S. Department of Commerce last year that it expected to sell the majority of the cells from the plant abroad, citing the new foreign demand for U.S.-made cells that arose after the Trump administration imposed tariffs on panels in 2018.

In a video presentation, Daimler Chief Executive Ola Kallenius said the new \u201cHyperscreen\u201d - which at 56 inches (142.24 cm) in width dwarfs Tesla\u2019s vaunted 17-inch screen - will make its debut in the EQS later this year, Mercedes\u2019 new fully electric sedan.  The EQS, with a driving range of 700 kilometers (435 miles), will be the first in a family of four vehicles built on the same all-electric platform.  \u201cThere\u2019s huge customer demand for this screen,\u201d Kallenius told reporters on a conference call. He said the dashboard would be an optional feature in the EQS, \u201cbut we expect a very high take-up rate,\u201d from buyers.  As well as including vehicle functions such as the speedometer, and music and navigation features, the screen will allow passengers to access some vehicle functions and, in some markets, to watch television without disturbing the driver.  Kallenius said besides revenue from the screens themselves, Daimler expects future profitable growth of subscription services, such as maps or entertainment customers will download.  \u201cIt is part of our business strategy to increase this profit pool of recurring revenues,\u201d he said.  Tesla has dominated global electric vehicle sales and traditional carmakers like Daimler have been pushing to develop vehicles to compete for market share.  The pressure to outdo Tesla has been heightened by tighter emissions standards in the European Union and China, and the decision by a growing number of countries to start banning sales of new petrol or diesel cars as early as 2030.","1153":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc's TSLA.O board has not yet received a detailed financing plan from CEO Elon Musk, and is seeking more information about how he will take the U.S. electric car maker private in a proposed deal worth $72 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.  While Tesla\u2019s board has held multiple discussions about Musk\u2019s proposal, which first became public on Tuesday, it has not yet received specific information on who will provide the funding, one of the sources said.  Tesla declined to comment.  Musk, a 47-year-old investor and engineer, stunned financial markets on Tuesday, when he revealed on Twitter he was considering a take-private deal for Tesla, an auto manufacturing pioneer that developed the world\u2019s first ever premium all-electric sedan car.  The move came after months of Musk battling investors, journalists and analysts over whether Tesla could turn a profit and produce enough of the mass market model of is flagship electric car to meet demand.  Musk said in a tweet on Tuesday that he had secured financing for the deal, but he did not publicly provide further details.  Speculation has swirled among shareholders and investment bankers about who could fund a deal of that size, especially given that the company\u2019s bonds are already rated junk by credit rating agencies.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has contacted Tesla to ask about Musk\u2019s assertion on Twitter that funding for his proposed deal was \u201csecured\u201d, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.  The revelation that the board is seeking more details from Musk could raise new questions about how he plans to finance the deal at his proposed price of $420 per share.  FILE PHOTO: People walk past a showroom outside Tesla China headquarters at China Central Mall in Beijing, China July 11, 2018. REUTERS\/Jason Lee\/File Photo  After jumping to close at $379.57 on Tuesday, Tesla shares have since fallen about 7 percent to end trading at $352.45 on Thursday, amid investor skepticism over the deal\u2019s prospects.  In a statement on Wednesday, Tesla\u2019s board said its discussion with Musk \u201caddressed the funding\u201d for the deal, without offering more details.  The board expects to make a decision on whether to launch a formal review of Musk\u2019s proposal in the coming days, and is speaking to investment bankers about hiring financial advisers to assist it in its review in such scenario, the sources said.  If the board launches a formal review of Musk\u2019s bid, he would have to recuse himself, or a special board committee would have to be formed, according to the sources, who requested anonymity because the deliberations are confidential.  The exact information that Musk communicated to the board about his plan could not be learned.  Taking Tesla private would remove the pressure from Musk coming from hedge funds betting that the company\u2019s stock will drop given its production issues and negative cash flow, as well as the glare of Wall Street that comes with reporting quarterly earnings publicly.  The company faces a make-or-break moment in its eight-year history as a public company as competition from European automakers is poised to intensify with new electric vehicles from Audi and Jaguar, with more rivals entering the market next year.  Tesla is still working its way out of what Musk called \u201cproduction hell\u201d at its home factory in Fremont, California, where a series of manufacturing challenges delayed the ramp-up of production of its new Model 3 sedan on which the company\u2019s profitability rests.  Meanwhile, Tesla has announced plans to build a factory in Shanghai, China, and another in Europe, but details are scarce and funding unknown.  DIFFICULT TO FINANCE  Musk has said he would be looking to keep his ownership of Tesla at around 20 percent in a buyout deal, and that a special purpose vehicle, like the one that exists at his aerospace company SpaceX, would allow Tesla shareholders to remain invested if they so choose.  Investment bankers and analysts have reacted with skepticism, telling Reuters it would be hard for Musk, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $22 billion, to raise the equity and debt financing needed for the deal given Tesla is not turning a profit.  Some analysts have suggested that Musk could convince Tesla\u2019s top shareholders, such as Fidelity Investments and China\u2019s Tencent, to roll their equity stakes into the deal, thereby significantly reducing the amount of money needed to be raised.  However, the deal structure would come with big logistical and legal challenges when it comes to buying out smaller shareholders, analysts have said.  Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF) has taken a stake of less than 5 percent in Tesla, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. It is not clear if PIF is interested in financing Musk\u2019s proposed take-private deal.","1154":"May 9 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc:  * CTW INVESTMENT GROUP URGES TESLA INC SHAREHOLDERS TO VOTE AGAINST RE-ELECTION OF DIRECTORS ANTONIO GRACIAS, KIMBALL MUSK, AND JAMES R.

REUTERS\/Daniel Becerril  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N hit 200,000 total electric vehicles sold in the United States by the end of 2018, reaching a threshold that triggers a phase-out of a $7,500 federal tax credit over the next 15 months, a person briefed on the matter said Wednesday.  The largest U.S. automaker reached the figure in the fourth quarter of 2018, which means the credit will fall to $3,750 in April, and then drop to $1,875 in October for six months. The credit will completely disappear by April 2020. The 200,000 figure covers GM\u2019s cumulative EV sales since 2010.  The tax credit is aimed at defraying the cost of electric vehicles that are more expensive than similarly sized internal combustion engine vehicles. In 2009, Congress set the phase-out threshold at 200,000 vehicles per manufacturer.  GM, which said previously it expected to reach the 200,000 sales figure before the end of 2018, declined to comment ahead of the release of its quarterly sales results on Thursday.  GM and Tesla Inc TSLA.O, which hit the 200,000 figure in July 2018, have both lobbied Congress to lift the cap or extend the existing tax credit. Tesla's EV tax credit fell to $3,750 on Tuesday and Tesla said it was cutting prices on its EVs by $2,000 to partially offset the lower tax credit.  In March, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra called on Congress to expand the consumer tax credit for electric vehicles as the company boosted production of the EV Bolt in response to consumer demand. She repeated the request last month during a visit to Capitol Hill.  GM said in November it was doubling resources allocated to developing electric and self-driving vehicles as part of a significant restructuring that includes ending production at five North American plants. GM also announced it would halt production of the plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt by March.  In November, a congressional report said 57,066 taxpayers claimed $375 million in EV tax credits in 2016.

NEW YORK, Aug 13 (Reuters) - On Monday morning, six days after Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that he was thinking about taking the company private at $420 a share, with \u201cfunding secured\u201d for the transaction, Tesla published a blog post in which Musk clarified his tweet.  When he said that funding for the buyout was secured, Musk said, he was referring to a promise he believed he had received from the managing director of Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. The Saudi fund, he said, had been encouraging him for nearly two years to use its capital to take Tesla private. At a meeting on July 31, after the Saudis acquired a 5 percent stake in Tesla on the public markets, the fund official told Musk it was too bad the company hadn\u2019t previously worked with the Saudis to take Tesla private, according to Musk. The fund official, Musk said, suggested it wasn\u2019t too late to change that.  \u201cHe strongly expressed his support for funding a going private transaction for Tesla at this time,\u201d Musk wrote in his blog post. \u201cI understood from him that no other decision makers were needed and that they were eager to proceed. I left the July 31st meeting with no question that a deal with the Saudi sovereign fund could be closed, and that it was just a matter of getting the process moving. This is why I referred to \u2018funding secured\u2019 in the August 7th announcement.\u201d  The market responded to Musk\u2019s blog post by dumping Tesla shares. The share price fell from a high of nearly $363 just after Monday\u2019s opening to a low of $349 at around noon Monday. (Shares bounced back to over $353 on Monday afternoon.)  Musk and Tesla may have been trying to stanch the stream of revelations that has followed Musk\u2019s tweet: The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Aug. 8 report that the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Musk\u2019s statement; an Aug. 10 Bloomberg story that Tesla was only in the early stages of devising a plan to fund a go-private deal; and Reuters scoops that the Tesla board hadn\u2019t received a financing plan from Musk before his tweet and that Saudi sovereign wealth fund \u201chas shown no interest\u201d in bankrolling a buyout.  But two plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers who filed shareholder class actions against Tesla on Friday told me Monday that Musk\u2019s blog will make it easier for them to pursue investor fraud claims.  \u201cAS CLOSE AS YOU\u2019RE GOING TO GET TO AN ADMISSION\u201d  \u201cThe blog post is as close as you\u2019re going to get to an admission that funding was not secured when Musk tweeted,\u201d said Reed Kathrein of Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, which filed a securities class action against Musk and Tesla on Friday night in San Francisco federal court. \u201cIt confirms what we thought.\u201d  Tesla declined to comment in response to an email asking whether Musk\u2019s blog post on Monday will make it easier for investors to claim securities fraud.  The Hagens Berman suit, as well as a similar class action filed about an hour earlier by Keller Lenkner, alleges that Musk\u2019s original \u201cfunding secured\u201d tweet and several followup postings artificially inflated the price of Tesla shares. The Keller Lenkner suit claimed Musk was manipulating Tesla\u2019s share price to punish Tesla short-sellers betting against the company\u2019s prospects.  Some short-sellers were so spooked by the spike in Tesla\u2019s share price after Musk\u2019s go-private tweets that they rushed to buy shares to cover their positions. Both Kathrein of Hagens Berman and Travis Lenkner of Keller Lenkner told me many of the hedge funds that have taken short positions in Tesla stock avoided the buying frenzy that followed Musk\u2019s Aug. 7 tweets.  Investors who didn\u2019t buy Tesla shares after the Musk tweets cannot be part of the securities fraud class actions because, under U.S. Supreme Court precedent, only investors who trade shares based on corporate misrepresentations \u2013 as opposed to investors who just hold their positions \u2013 are considered to have been affected by the fraud.  When plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers filed their lawsuits late Friday, they could not cite evidence that Musk knew buyout financing wasn\u2019t actually secure at the time he tweeted that it was. The class actions argued that Tesla\u2019s subsequent statements and actions implied uncertainty about the funding of any go-private deal: Why, for example, would Musk and Tesla now be holding meetings with bankers and other funding sources if the buyout financing were as secure as Musk represented it to be?  Musk\u2019s blog post, Lenkner said, removes any ambiguity. \u201cThe statement makes it clear \u2013 funding was not secure when Musk tweeted,\u201d he said.  Kathrein said Musk may have posted his explanation about Saudi funding to show that he really believed the money was in place when he tweeted that his financing was secure. In securities class actions, shareholders have to prove defendants acted with the intention of defrauding shareholders. But Kathrein said the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 decision in Omnicare v. Laborers District Council Construction Industry Pension Fund holds that corporations can\u2019t pretend statements of fact are unactionable opinions.  The quick drop in Tesla\u2019s share price as the market absorbed Musk\u2019s disclosure, Kathrein said, will also help investors prove that Musk\u2019s original tweet artificially inflated Tesla\u2019s value. The share price corrected itself, under this theory, when Musk\u2019s blog post on Monday revealed the truth that Tesla\u2019s buyout funding is not secured.  DAMAGES ESTIMATED AT UP TO $1 BILLION  Stock drops following this kind of \u201ccorrective disclosure,\u201d as this is known, are usually at the heart of securities fraud class actions because they allow investors to show the impact of the misrepresentation.  Not just short-sellers are included in the Tesla fraud class actions. Even long-term Tesla investors who bought shares after Musk floated that $420 per share buyout prospect in his Aug. 7 tweet would be part of the investor classes posited in the Hagens Berman and Keller Lenkner suits.  So what was the impact of Musk\u2019s tweet? Both Kathrein and Lenkner estimated that damages could run to $1 billion \u2013 though I should caution that it\u2019s way too early to put a definitive number on Tesla\u2019s exposure. Lenkner said his scratchpad estimate is based on the millions of Tesla shares \u2013 more than $11 billion worth \u2013 traded on Aug. 7 and 8. Even if the share price was inflated by only 10 percent, Lenkner said, the high volume of trading leads to big potential damages.  The first hint of investor losses will come in about two months, when shareholders file briefs vying to lead the fraud litigation against Tesla. Typically, under the 1995 law governing private securities class actions, federal judges appoint the shareholder or group of shareholders with the biggest losses to head up the case.  Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers use a variety of methodologies to calculate damages so it will be interesting to see their assessment of how Musk\u2019s tweet affected share price.  It will also be interesting to see which Tesla investors end up bidding to lead the litigation. The two who have so far filed suits are relatively small investors. One spent about $1 million in Tesla share purchases after Musk\u2019s tweets, the other, about $500,000.  But shareholders now have two months to decide whether to compete to be in charge of the case. Lenkner said his firm is in discussions with hedge funds that had larger short positions in Tesla and bought shares to cover a portion of their shorts in the initial run-up following Musk\u2019s tweet.  \u201cHedge funds that might normally be hesitant to sign up as a lead plaintiff might look at this and see there\u2019s something there,\u201d Lenkner said.

FILE PHOTO: SpaceX owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk arrives on the red carpet for the automobile awards \"Das Goldene Lenkrad\" (The golden steering wheel) given by a German newspaper in Berlin, Germany, November 12, 2019. REUTERS\/Hannibal Hanschke  The market\u2019s fortunes remain beholden not to the battery supply chain but to the much larger stainless steel sector, and nickel prices are hovering around levels that are more likely to force out existing operators than entice new ones.  And it is concern about the state of the stainless steel market that is dampening nickel\u2019s prospects.  MORE NICKEL?  \u201cTesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way,\u201d the electric car company\u2019s charismatic leader told a post-earnings conference call.  Musk\u2019s enthusiasm for new supply is understandable, though telling the market that you are looking to buy huge tonnage is unusual consumer behaviour.  Traders duly took their cue and the London Metal Exchange (LME) nickel price fizzed from $13,150 a tonne to a high of $13,705 on Thursday.  Maybe Mr Musk is simply doing his bit to push up the price to a level where new projects will be incentivised, given that nickel could do with a helping hand.  (Graphic: Cobalt vs nickel prices since 2010 link: tmsnrt.rs\/3eVaVWd)  TOO MUCH NICKEL?  Nickel has been dragged higher in the broader base metals recovery, but it is one of the laggards within the LME suite. Currently trading at $13,435 as the Tesla tremor fades, it is down 5% since the start of the year.  It\u2019s not difficult to see why.  The International Nickel Study Group (INSG) estimates the global refined market was in a supply surplus of 57,300 tonnes after the first five months of the year, representing a sharp turnaround from a deficit of 31,500 tonnes at the same point of 2019.  The median forecast in Reuters\u2019 July analyst poll is for a surplus of 100,000 tonnes in 2020, making it the first year of oversupply since 2015.  LME nickel stocks are plentiful at 234,636 tonnes and LME time spreads continue to trade in comfortable contango, contrasting with a tightening trend in other metals, such as copper.  INDONESIAN RESILIENCE  Nickel supply has not been unaffected by the wave of lockdowns that followed COVID-19 around the world.  Global mine production fell by 10% in the January-May period, with the Philippines - a major ore supplier to China\u2019s nickel pig iron (NPI) producers - recording a sharp 14% slide, according to the INSG.  Refined production fell in several countries, reflecting lockdowns in Canada and in Madagascar, where Sumitomo Corp has just booked an impairment charge on its Ambatovy operations.  Ferronickel producers also lowered production in the face of steep discounts to an already low outright nickel price.  However, global refined production was still up 1% for January-May thanks to growing output of NPI in Indonesia, where the mining and processing sector appears to have been relatively untouched by the coronavirus.  Indonesian production surged by 55% year on year as construction of new processing capacity continues unabated.  The incentive comes from a government ban at the start of this year on exports of unprocessed nickel ore.  It\u2019s noticeable that Chinese imports of Indonesian ore were only 202,000 tonnes in April and May, while imports of Indonesian \u201cferronickel\u201d totalled 380,000 tonnes.  The continuing trend of Chinese NPI capacity moving offshore to Indonesia also continues, it seems.  (Graphic: Synchronised slowdown in the stainless steel sector link: )  CONSUMPTION HIT  While Indonesia has held global production steady over the first part of this year, consumption everywhere else has taken a hit. The INSG estimates global usage fell by 8% year on year for the January-May period.  The point of maximum weakness has been the stainless steel sector, which still dwarfs electric vehicles in terms of nickel\u2019s usage profile.  Stainless steel output tumbled 8% in the first quarter, the International Stainless Steel Forum (ISSF) says.  Production fell by 9% in China, the global stainless powerhouse, and by 7% in the rest of the world - the first synchronised downturn since the fourth quarter of 2018.  Stainless steel\u2019s exposure to coronavirus-hit sectors such as hospitality (cutlery), oil and gas (pipes) and aerospace creates considerable headwinds for the nickel market.  Overproduction by Chinese stainless steel producers fighting for market share might mitigate the nickel hit, but only at the expense of a build in stocks further down the chain.  \u201cDelayed cuts from stainless and alloys, the resulting product overhang and slow recovery of certain end-use sectors is expected to drag out a multi-year surplus,\u201d says Citi, which is very much in the bear camp of analysts. (\u201cQ3 Commodities Market Outlook\u201d, July 2020)  But the current price is pretty much saying the same thing. One of the reasons cited by Sumitomo for its Ambatovy writedown was \u201cthe decline in mid to long-term nickel price outlook\u201d.  STAINLESS TRAP  Tesla\u2019s Musk doesn\u2019t care about stainless steel or those forms of nickel that go into making it. Like other car companies, he needs battery-grade nickel, which is a subset of the many forms nickel can take.  And he\u2019s probably right to be worried.  There is no shortage of new projects in the planning pipeline, but the main hindrance to development is the current muted nickel market.  Though the pressure is most acute for those most dependent on the stainless sector, such as ferronickel operators, producers of battery-grade nickel are not being spared.  Nickel\u2019s battery story continues to attract much investment interest, to judge by the social media reaction to Musk\u2019s comments, but it remains trapped in a stainless steel mesh for now.  Elon Musk may want more nickel mines, but it\u2019s the stainless sector that will decide if he gets them.

Robyn Beck\/Pool via REUTERS  (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O chief executive Elon Musk said the electric car company will reimburse customers if delays to car deliveries cause them to miss out on a significant tax credit.  Under a major tax overhaul passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress late last year, incentives in the way of tax credits that lower the cost of electric vehicles are available for the first 200,000 such vehicles sold by an automaker. The tax credit is then reduced by 50 percent every six months until it phases out.  Earlier this year, Tesla said orders for cars placed by Oct. 15 would be eligible for the full tax credit of $7,500 and that customers would receive their cars by the end of the year. From Jan. 1, 2019, the tax credit drops to $3,750.  With only a few days of 2018 remaining, some customers still waiting for their vehicles have used social media to complain about the delays and what they called a lack of communication by the company.  Responding on Saturday to a Twitter user who asked what will happen if cars did not arrive in time, Musk replied: \u201cIf Tesla committed delivery & customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end, Tesla will cover the tax credit difference.\u201d  Also on Saturday, Musk said on Twitter that the company should have all orders for the mid-range Model 3 - a mass-market sedan that Tesla hopes is its key to success - delivered by the end of the year.","1167":"(Corrects Bowers\u2019 title to VP of monetization engineering from VP of monetization in paragraph 1 and Field\u2019s title to Senior VP of Engineering from VP of Engineering in paragraph 2)  May 22 (Reuters) - Electric carmaker Tesla Inc said on Tuesday it had hired Snap Inc\u2019s vice president of monetization engineering, Stuart Bowers, as VP of engineering.

S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that the company would join the S&P 500 index prior to the opening of trading on Dec. 21, potentially in two tranches making it easier for investment funds to digest.  \u201c(Tesla) will be one of the largest weight additions to the S&P 500 in the last decade, and consequently will generate one of the largest funding trades in S&P 500 history,\u201d S&P Dow Jones Indices said.  With a stock market value over $400 billion, Tesla will be among the most valuable companies ever added to the widely followed stock market index, larger than 95% of the S&P 500\u2019s existing components.  Its inclusion means investment funds indexed to the S&P 500 will have to sell about $51 billion worth of shares of companies already in the S&P 500 and use that money to buy shares of Tesla, so that their portfolios correctly reflect the index, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Tesla will account for about 1% of the index.  Additionally, actively managed investment funds that try to beat the S&P 500 will be forced to decide whether to buy Tesla shares. Such funds manage trillions of dollars in additional assets.  Up about 450% in 2020, the California car maker has become the most valuable auto company in the world, by far, despite production that is a fraction of rivals such as Toyota Motor, Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE and General Motors.

A blockbuster quarterly report in July cleared a major hurdle for Tesla\u2019s potential inclusion in the S&P 500, leading to speculation that it might be added to the index and spark a surge in demand for its shares.  In 1999, Yahoo surged 64% in five trading days between the announcement that it would be added to the index on Nov. 30 and its inclusion after the close of trading on Dec. 7. Yahoo\u2019s market capitalization at the time was about $56 billion, around a fraction of Tesla\u2019s current value.

On Jan. 18, Tesla said it would cut thousands of jobs to rein in costs as it plans to increase production of lower-priced versions of its crucial Model 3 sedan, sending its shares down as much as 10 percent.  As part of the hedging program, PIF will still hold the shares but with little exposure to the stock\u2019s movements, according to the report.

REUTERS\/Aaron P. Bernstein  Tesla has already sought this month to play down widespread Wall Street speculation that it would need to return to capital markets this year to raise more funds for the money-losing company as it ramps up production of the Model 3 sedan seen as crucial to its long-term profitability.  The Silicon Valley car maker, which has consistently fallen short of promised production targets and is fighting bad publicity over a fatal crash of a car using its Autopilot system, said 10 days ago it would have positive cash flow from the third quarter.  Musk went further on Friday in a tweeted response to a story in The Economist which cited estimates Tesla would need $2.5 billion to $3 billion this year in additional funding.  \u201cThe Economist used to be boring, but smart with a wicked dry wit. Now it\u2019s just boring (sigh). Tesla will be profitable & cash flow+ in Q3 & Q4, so obv no need to raise money,\u201d Musk wrote.  Tesla shares, which have gained nearly 10 percent since disclosing the Model 3 production numbers on April 3, were up 1.8 percent in afternoon trading on Wall Street.  Musk\u2019s claim about profit and cash flow hinges on a rapid rise in production of the Model 3 sedan, Tesla\u2019s latest vehicle to have experienced production delays. That has postponed revenue from reaching Tesla\u2019s bottom line from cars being delivered to customers.  An unprecedented level of robots used in the Model 3\u2019s final assembly, in a break with automotive manufacturing norms, has added complexity and delays, which Musk acknowledged on Friday.  \u201cExcessive automation at Tesla was a mistake,\u201d Musk tweeted. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated.\u201d  Thomson Reuters consensus of analyst estimates predicts Tesla\u2019s free cash flow to be negative well into 2019, thanks in part to heavy investments. Only one of 19 analysts covering the stock see positive adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter, with that number growing to four for the fourth quarter.  Wall Street brokerage Jefferies, which provided the funding estimate cited by The Economist, said in a note last week it expects refinancing risk to remain high for Tesla until it can consistently produce 10,000 Model 3s a week.  The company again missed its own 2,500 target for weekly production at the end of the first quarter, and analysts and fund managers doubt Tesla\u2019s ability to keep production growing to a promised 5,000 Model 3s per week in three months time.  Musk in July said Tesla was going through \u201cmanufacturing hell\u201d in ramping up production of the Model 3.  He told \u201cCBS News\u201d in an interview that aired Friday the company \u201cgot complacent\u201d and \u201cput too much new technology into the Model 3 all at once.\u201d Part of the interview took place in a Tesla Model 3 Musk was driving with Autopilot activated at times.  Musk told CBS Tesla is currently producing 2,000 Model 3 cars a week.  Last month, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded Tesla\u2019s credit rating to B3 from B2, reflecting \u201cthe significant shortfall in the production rate of the company\u2019s Model 3.\u201d  Moody\u2019s added that its negative outlook for Tesla \u201creflects the likelihood that Tesla will have to undertake a large, near-term capital raise in order to refund maturing obligations and avoid a liquidity shortfall.\u201d  On Thursday, the National Transportation Safety Board said that after a series of public disclosures by Tesla it had taken the unusual step of revoking Tesla\u2019s status as a formal party to its investigation of a March 23 crash in California that killed a driver who was using Autopilot. The NTSB is also investigating two other Tesla crashes.  Tesla lashed out at the NTSB and said it planned to complain to Congress.  Asked by CBS if there was a defect with Autopilot, Musk responded: \u201cThe system worked as described, which is that it is a hands-on system. It is not a self-driving system.\u201d  At one point during the interview, Musk did not have his hands on the wheel and the car beeped at him to retake the wheel.","1172":"DETROIT, March 3 (Reuters) - General Motors Co executives on Wednesday will tackle one of their toughest tasks: Persuading investors that a Detroit automaker can catch up with Elon Musk and Tesla Inc as vehicles go electric.  Even as global markets reel from coronavirus fears, Tesla\u2019s valuation is outpacing that of GM and most other legacy automakers. On Tuesday, Tesla\u2019s market cap hovered around $144 billion, more than three times GM\u2019s $45 billion.  GM is by far the larger manufacturer by volume, and generates more cash and profits. But in the electric vehicle market, Tesla is the leader.  Last year, Tesla sold 367,500 electric vehicles globally, including 223,000 in the United States. GM sold just 16,400 Chevrolet Bolt EVs to U.S. buyers, and 60,000 Baojun E-Series models in China with joint venture partner SAIC Motor .  GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra and President Mark Reuss have ramped up electric vehicle development over the past three years, focusing on a proprietary battery, a low-cost flexible vehicle design and a blueprint for high-volume production, mainly in China.  The company has revealed its electric vehicle strategy in incremental steps - announcing the Hummer brand will be reborn as an electric pickup and partnering with Korean battery maker LG Chem to build a $2.3 billion battery plant near a shuttered GM car plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM is now trying to put the broader picture into focus for investors.  GM has said it aims to reduce the cost of battery cells - the single greatest expense in electric vehicles - to less than $100 per kilowatt-hour. That in turn could slash the cost of battery packs for electric vehicles like the Chevrolet Bolt EV by up to 45%, experts say.  GM is also developing an advanced battery, in partnership with LG Chem and Japan\u2019s Honda Motor Co, that will be smaller than current EV batteries, can be charged more quickly and will provide more energy.  Musk has told investors that Tesla has battery cost and range breakthroughs in the works that it will describe at a \u201cBattery Day\u201d in April.  Barra has said GM plans to spend more on electric vehicles than on gasoline-powered cars over the next five years. But it has not put a figure on how much it will invest in its efforts to rival Tesla and traditional competitors such as Volkswagen AG or Ford Motor Co as the electric vehicle market develops.  Barra has, however, promised that GM will make money on electric cars by 2021.

FILE PHOTO: A Tesla electric car supercharger station is seen in Los Angeles, California, U.S. August 2, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  The company said in a filing that it had increased its offer to 3.1 million shares, rising to 3.5 million including a tranche for underwriting banks, from an initially planned 2.7 million, priced at $243 per share.  The filing also showed it would place convertible debt worth $1.6 billion, up from an initial planned $1.35 billion. That all pointed to buoyant interest in the offering and shares in the company rose 2.5 percent in morning trading.  The coupon for the debt offering, however, was set at 2.0 percent - the top of the indicated range - suggesting the company had ceded ground to investors to borrow so much.  The conversion premium at which the bonds can be exchanged for stock in the future, was also at the bottom of the initial range given by the company - another concession.  \u201cSeeing the offering amount raised does not surprise me at all,\u201d Clement Thibault, senior analyst at global financial markets platform Investing.com.  \u201cAs far as Tesla is concerned, the more money in the bank, the better.\u201d  Tesla\u2019s launch of a capital raise was greeted with relief by Wall Street on Thursday after a tumultuous year which has seen analysts and investors cast doubt on its ability to produce, sell and deliver enough cars to make a sustainable profit.  The company faces expensive challenges, including launching production in China, overhauling its U.S. retail and service operations and developing new models, including the high-volume Model Y SUV and a Semi commercial truck.  Many analysts had calculated that without new cash Tesla - which burned through $1.5 billion in the first quarter and has seen demand for its cars soften - would not be able to carry out its plans.  The company said that after all costs had been deducted it could now get up to $2.7 billion in new capital from the offer. That compared to the $2.2 billion in cash reserves the company held at the end of March.  BUY IN  Billionaire Musk, whose fortune centers around a 20 percent stake in the $42-billion company, also doubled his initial commitment for buying shares and will now buy stock worth up to $25 million, the company said.  \u201cThe fact that Musk could increase its share from $10 million to $25 million is in line with the usual marketing scheme,\u201d said Nord LB analyst Frank Schwope. \u201cMusk always tries to surprise with promises that are often not kept.\u201d  Including the option for underwriters to buy 15 percent in each offering, Tesla will sell about $860 million in new shares and $1.84 billion in debt.  Tesla had said on Thursday it would raise up to $2.3 billion in new capital through shares and debt. That included an offering of 2.7 billion shares worth around $650 million and $1.35 billion in debt, before issues to underwriters.  Tesla\u2019s junk and convertible bonds opened roughly unchanged from Thursday\u2019s close, with the bonds of its SolarCity unit higher, according to Refinitiv data.

But for the immediate pandemic use - should its vaccine candidate win market approval \u2013 it has production sites with regulatory approval in Germany with a capacity to produce hundreds of millions of doses.  The company, based in Tuebingen and backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, is a pioneer of the so-called messenger RNA approach, which is also pursued by BioNTech and its partner Pfizer as well as Moderna.  RNA molecules are single-stranded, and thanks to their recurring molecular pattern, they can be produced in a relatively simple biochemical process that do not require genetically modified living cells, which are needed to produce most other biotech drugs.

The move comes a day after a 5-for-1 stock split took effect, Tesla\u2019s first since its initial public offering in June 2010, and follows a nearly six-fold increase in the value of its shares this year.  Tuesday\u2019s share sale comes as Tesla seeks to massively expand production of its existing vehicles and build new factories near Berlin, Germany and Austin, Texas. The company also plans to launch new lines of vehicles, including a semi-truck called the Tesla Semi and its futuristic Cybertruck.  Tesla said it plans to use proceeds from the offering to strengthen its balance sheet and for general corporate purposes.

Can\u2019t tell an anode from a cathode? Here is a simple guide to the jargon likely to be tossed around at Tesla\u2019s Battery Day on Sept. 22.  FILE PHOTO: A Tesla car is charged at a super-fast multi-charging power column in Bonn, Germany November 5, 2018. REUTERS\/Wolfgang Rattay\/File Photo  CELLS AND PACKS  A Tesla Model 3 uses a single lithium-ion battery pack that houses four smaller modules. Each module contains 700 to 1,000 individual cylindrical cells, shaped much like the ones in a flashlight.  Cells can come in different shapes and sizes, but most have three key elements: Electrodes, electrolyte and separator.  Electrodes store the lithium. The electrolyte carries the lithium ions between electrodes. The separator keeps the positive electrode from coming in contact with the negative electrode.  Energy, in the form of electricity, is discharged from the battery cell when lithium ions flow from the negative electrode, or anode, to the positive electrode, or cathode. When the cell is charging, those ions flow in the opposite direction, from cathode to anode.  Panasonic supplies cylindrical battery cells to Tesla for the Model 3 and Model Y. The positive electrodes are made from a combination of nickel, aluminum and small amounts of cobalt, called NCA.  In China, CATL supplies Tesla with battery cells in a flat format called prismatic, with a different cathode mixture (lithium iron phosphate, or LFP). This material contains no cobalt and is less expensive than Panasonic\u2019s NCA chemistry, but does not hold as much energy or provide as much range as the NCA cylindrical batteries of the same size or mass.  POWER TALK  In electric vehicles, power is expressed in kilowatts (kW) while energy is expressed in kilowatt-hours (kWh).  \u201cTo have great acceleration in an EV, you\u2019d want high power density. To have long range, you\u2019d want high energy density,\u201d said electrochemist Leah Ellis, co-founder of Sublime Systems.  Tesla\u2019s next generation of batteries is expected to be able to store more energy \u2014 and thus enable greater vehicle range \u2014 while providing more power.  Because LFP battery cells typically cannot store as much energy as NCA cells, vehicles that use LFP cells generally require more of them to achieve the same range between charges as vehicles powered by NCA cells.  RANGE AND LIFE  Tesla vehicles currently can drive up to 400 miles between charges with NCA cells and nearly 300 miles with LFP cells. Tesla has said the new Cybertruck will get up to 500 miles.  Tesla\u2019s next generation of batteries is expected to have much longer life: The equivalent of 1 million miles or more, compared with about 500,000 miles today.  MEASURES OF COST  The cost of battery cells and packs is coming down rapidly. Measured in dollars per kilowatt-hour ($\/kWh), experts have pegged $100\/kWh at the cell level as the point where electric cars will begin to approach the cost of vehicles powered by combustion engines and fossil fuel.  A lithium ion battery cell that costs $100\/kWh to produce means a battery pack, with its additional battery management system, cooling system and other materials, could cost $125-$130\/kWh or more.  Today\u2019s battery packs cost around $10,000-$12,000, depending on their capacity. Tesla is aiming to reduce the cost of future packs to less than $6,000, which would put the cell cost at well under $100\/kWh.","1189":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has sent subpoenas to Tesla Inc TSLA.O regarding Chief Executive Elon Musk's plan to take the company private and his statement that funding was \"secured,\" Fox Business Network reported on Wednesday, citing sources.  The electric carmaker's shares fell as much as 4 percent but cut their losses after Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N said it was dropping equity coverage of Tesla because it is acting as a financial adviser on a matter related to the automaker.  Investors viewed the Goldman statement as confirming a tweet from Elon Musk on Monday about working with Goldman, even as the reported subpoenas indicated the SEC has opened a formal investigation into a matter.  The latest news extended the roller-coaster ride for Tesla investors in recent days, adding to uncertainty about the future course of the company and whether a deal can be done amid growing regulatory complications.  Tesla and the SEC declined to comment.  Musk stunned investors and sent Tesla\u2019s shares soaring 11 percent when he tweeted early last week that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 per share and that he had secured funding for the potential deal.  The shares fell 2.6 percent to $338.69 on Wednesday, below $341.99, their closing price the day before Musk tweeted his plan to take Tesla private.  The Tesla CEO provided no details of his funding until Monday, when he said in a blog on Tesla\u2019s website that he was in discussions with Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and other potential backers but that financing was not yet nailed down.  Musk also tweeted late Monday night he was working with Goldman Sachs and private equity firm Silver Lake as financial advisers. However, as of Tuesday, Goldman was still negotiating its terms of engagement with Musk, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The 47-year old billionaire\u2019s tweet about secured funding may have violated U.S. securities law if he misled investors. On Monday, lawyers told Reuters Musk\u2019s statement indicated he had good reason to believe he had funding but seemed to have overstated its status by saying it was secured.  The SEC has opened an inquiry into Musk\u2019s tweets, according to one person with direct knowledge of the matter. Reuters was not immediately able to ascertain if this had escalated into a full-blown investigation on Wednesday.  This source said Tesla\u2019s independent board members had hired law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP to help handle the SEC inquiry and other fiduciary duties with respect to a potential deal.

FILE PHOTO: General Motors Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra announces a major investment focused on the development of GM future technologies at the GM Orion Assembly Plant in Lake Orion, Michigan, U.S. March 22, 2019. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook\/File Photo  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra and top executives hosted an investor conference in New York to convince potential shareholders GM is a burgeoning technology firm at the forefront of tomorrow\u2019s electric and self-driving cars.  \u201cWe believe we\u2019re a compelling investment opportunity,\u201d GM Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara told reporters after GM reported quarterly results, when asked about the run-up in Tesla\u2019s stock.  \u201cFrom a share-price standpoint, we\u2019re very bullish on the future,\u201d she added.  Barra has been restructuring GM\u2019s operations and stressing her goals of readying GM for a future of \u201czero emissions and zero accidents\u201d for several years.  Still, GM shares trade just above the $33 share price of its 2010 initial public offering. That has left it with a market capitalization of about $49 billion, below Tesla\u2019s valuation of about $130 billion.  \u201cThe market\u2019s got it wrong,\u201d said Chris Susanin, co-portfolio manager with Levin Easterly Partners, which owns shares in GM but not Tesla. \u201cGM should be the $150 billion market cap, not Tesla.\u201d  The bulk of GM\u2019s profits is still derived from the fuel-hungry pickup trucks and SUVs sold in the United States. The Chinese market has been the source of a steady $2 billion in profits a year, but that is threatened by a market slowdown, rising costs for electrification and now the disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak.  While China will deliver lower equity income to GM in the near term, it remains a solid contributor that is profitable and dividend paying, and will play a key role in the development of EVs globally, officials said. GM also sees growth for its Cadillac brand in China.  \u2018HAVE OUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO\u2019  Barra\u2019s challenge now is to assure investors that GM can make the leap across the gap separating its profitable internal combustion present and an uncertain electric future.  While gasoline-powered vehicles will make up a large portion of U.S. sales into the 2030s, GM has said it will spend more on developing electric vehicles than those with internal combustion engines over the next five years.  GM laid out a more detailed plan for the development of EVs and self-driving vehicles at the investor day, including its Cruise self-driving unit.  Some analysts have suggested GM should spin off Cruise, but Suryadevara said GM has no plans to do that. She added that spending in 2020 on that business will roughly match last year\u2019s $800 million.  Cruise CEO Dan Ammann said the self-driving market opportunity totals $8 trillion.  One of the audiences for the investor day is potential employees as GM competes with Tesla and other automakers globally to hire top engineers and software developers outside of Detroit, highlighting technical centers in Ontario and Israel.  Barra, asked whether Tesla\u2019s eventual electric pickup offering could squeeze GM\u2019s margins, said her company understands that business. \u201cI think we can have our cake and eat it too,\u201d she said.  GM also said it will offer its Supercruise partially automated driving system on 22 models by the end of 2023, GM President Mark Reuss said.  GM also laid out its plan to reduce manufacturing complexity this year by eliminating 25% of the parts used in its plants. Barra also said GM targets sourcing all of its global electricity from renewable sources by 2040, a decade sooner than previously promised.  In December, GM and South Korea's LG Chem 051910.KS said they would invest $2.3 billion to build an EV battery cell joint venture plant in Ohio, creating one of the world's largest battery facilities.  That same month, GM\u2019s Cadillac chief said most if not all of the vehicles offered by the luxury brand would be electric by 2030.

(Reporting by Bhargav Acharya in Bengaluru; editing by Uttaresh.V)","1198":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla said it would produce its new Model 3 sedan at a profit after several recent weeks in which output stabilized, buoying hopes that the electric vehicle maker led by Elon Musk will stanch its financial losses in the second half of the year.  Chief Executive Musk is under intense pressure to prove he can deliver consistent production numbers for the sedan, Tesla\u2019s lowest-priced model and the key to its plans to become a mass-market automaker, after a host of manufacturing challenges and concerns it was running through cash too quickly.  Despite Tesla reporting a record loss that doubled to $718 million in the second quarter, shares jumped as much as 11 percent in after-hours trading, as investors focused on steadier production volumes and a slower rate of cash burn. That put it on track to retake the title of most valuable U.S. automaker from General Motors Co.  The company cut its capital spending plans and said it would not hit its long-term rate of producing 10,000 Model 3s per week until next year, trading off production ramp speed for financial health.  \u201cWe like the more muted tone of the company\u2019s outlook, with the absence of unnecessary new stretch goals,\u201d said CFRA analyst Efraim Levy. \u201cPerhaps it reflects a more cautious Elon Musk.\u201d  The outspoken Musk, who told analysts last quarter that he refused to answer their \u201cboring\u201d questions, apologized multiple times on Wednesday during a post-earnings call for his past behavior.  Tesla said that during July it had hit an earlier goal of building about 5,000 Model 3s per week \u201cmultiple times\u201d, and reiterated a target of producing 6,000 per week by late August. Analysts have questioned whether the 5,000 rate would be sustainable.  It expects to build a total of up to 55,000 Model 3s in the third quarter, which works out to an average weekly rate of 4,230, at a roughly 15 percent gross margin, rising to 20 percent in the fourth quarter.  Tesla delivered its 200,000th electric car - including its more expensive Model S and X vehicles - in July, a threshold which means a $7,500 federal subsidy will remain in place to the end of the year.  Had it delivered the car in June, the subsidy would have lapsed a quarter earlier, a strategic move applauded by Ross Gerber, chief executive of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, which holds Tesla shares.  Thus far, Tesla has only produced higher-cost versions of the Model 3, starting at about $49,000. But Musk said many of the trade-ins it received were mass-market vehicles, including the Toyota Prius and Honda Accords and Civics.  Tesla recently opened up reservations for the Model 3, allowing new buyers of the pricier models to jump ahead of those who had ordered base models of the vehicle two years ago. That angered some deposit-holders, and analysts questioned whether more would drop out because of delays making the cheaper $35,000 version.  CASH FLOW POSITIVE  Wall Street analysts have also questioned whether Tesla would need to raise more cash, but Musk said on the call that he expected the company to be henceforth profitable and cash flow positive, excluding some debt repayment, and had no plans for an equity raise.  Tesla plans to pay off its upcoming debt - some $1.8 billion comes due before November 2019 - through internally generated cash flow, Musk said.  Tesla ended the second quarter with $2.78 billion in cash after spending $610 million in capital expenses.  Free cash flow, a key metric of financial health, narrowed to negative $740 million in the second quarter from negative $1 billion in the first quarter, excluding solar business costs.

Tesla said its capital expenses would be slightly below $2.5 billion in 2018, less than last year\u2019s $3.4 billion.  The company also outlined expansion plans, saying it would likely announce the location of a European factory this year and planned a Shanghai, China plant to produce both vehicles and batteries. Tesla\u2019s China investment would not start \u201cin any significant way\u201d until 2019, with much of the roughly $2 billion cost to be funded via local debt.  Excluding items, Tesla reported a loss of $2.45 per share, compared with expectations of a loss of $2.92.  Total revenue rose to $4 billion from $2.79 billion.

Now it seems that Musk could be setting his sights on disrupting the multibillion-dollar tequila industry.  On Oct. 12, he tweeted \u201cTeslaquila coming soon\u201d and an accompanying \u201cvisual approximation\u201d of a red and white label with the Tesla logo and a caption that stated \u201c100 percent Puro de Agave.\u201d  Not so fast, said Mexico\u2019s Tequila Regulatory Council (CRT). It argued that the \u201cname \u2018Teslaquila\u2019 evokes the word Tequila ... (and) Tequila is a protected word.\u201d  The CRT keeps tabs on producers to assure they adhere to strict denomination of origin rules, which dictate the spirit must be made in the Mexican states of Guanajuato, Jalisco, Michoacan, Nayarit or Tamaulipas, among other requirements.  According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office website, Tesla has filed an application to trademark \u201cTeslaquila\u201d as a \u201cdistilled agave liquor\u201d and \u201cdistilled blue agave liquor.\u201d Similar applications have been filed in Mexico, the European Union and Jamaica.

Tesla did not respond to several requests for comment.  Other high-profile celebrities have cashed in on tequila\u2019s new-found international appeal, as the sprit moves into the ranks of top-shelf liquors and sheds its image as a fiery booze drunk by desperadoes and frat boys.  Last year, Diageo Plc DGE.L bought actor George Clooney's high-end tequila brand Casamigos for up to $1 billion.  Other recent deals in the industry include Bacardi Ltd's BACLTD.UL January deal to buy fine tequila maker Patron Spirits International for $5.1 billion.

Musk said last year that for electric flight to work, the energy density of batteries needed to improve to over 400 Wh\/kg, a threshold which may be achieved in five years.  The electric car manufacturer also showed an image where a number of dots are clustered in line formations, sparking speculation among media and fans about what it will reveal at the event.

FILE PHOTO: Tesla China-made Model 3 vehicles are seen during a delivery event at its factory in Shanghai, China January 7, 2020. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  U.S. District Judge Edward Chen ruled on Wednesday that shareholders could try to prove Musk intended to defraud them with his Aug. 7, 2018 tweet and follow-up messages about plans for his Palo Alto, California-based company.  The judge said shareholders could also try to prove Musk\u2019s tweet was the \u201cproximate cause\u201d of volatility in Tesla\u2019s stock price that caused billions of dollars of losses.  Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The lawsuit arose after Musk stunned investors on Aug. 7, 2018 by announcing on Twitter: \u201cAm considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\u201d  Musk\u2019s tweet helped push Tesla\u2019s stock price more than 13% above the prior day\u2019s close. But it soon gave those gains back, and by Aug. 17, 2018 had fallen 11% below where it was before the original tweet.  Some investors called the tweet a ploy to squeeze short-sellers, long an irritant for Musk, who were betting Tesla\u2019s stock would fall.  Musk tweeted on Aug. 24, 2018 that Tesla would remain public.  A month later, he agreed to pay a $20 million civil fine to settle fraud charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The SEC also required Musk to step down as chairman, and Tesla lawyers to vet some of his tweets in advance. Tesla reached a separate $20 million settlement with the regulator.  Tesla\u2019s stock price has since roughly doubled, and Musk is worth $37.6 billion according to Forbes magazine.  In letting the shareholder case, which combined nine lawsuits, go forward, Chen said reasonable investors could have viewed Musk\u2019s Aug. 7 tweet as signaling he had unconditionally obtained enough financing to take Tesla private.  \u201cSo read, the statement is not true,\u201d Chen wrote.  The judge rejected Tesla\u2019s and Musk\u2019s argument that the tweet was not false or misleading because Tesla\u2019s directors would have still had to approve the transaction.  The proposed class action covers shareholders who bought and sold Tesla stock from Aug. 7 to Aug. 17, 2018. Their lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Shares rose nearly 21% to $307.12 after hours on the unexpected news, crossing $300 for the first time since March 1 after record deliveries and cost cuts ensured a profitable third quarter.  Tesla on Wednesday posted a cash balance increase to $5.3 billion and reported a profit of $1.86 per share, shattering analyst expectations for a loss of 42 cents per share.  The third-quarter results are an important milestone for Tesla and redemption for Musk who had to step down as chairman after a series of scandals and investor doubts about Tesla\u2019s ability to withstand competition from larger, better capitalized global rivals.  Tesla\u2019s gross margins, an important profit indicator for investors, surpassed expectations and Tesla said it was \u201chighly confident\u201d in exceeding the low end of its yearly global vehicle delivery goal.  But Tesla has yet to prove that it can be consistently profitable while managing the start of production for Model 3 sedans at its new factory in Shanghai and for Model Y sport utilities next year.  \u201cGiven the breakneck speed of expansion, Tesla will face significant demands on its cash pile,\u201d said Nicholas Hyett, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.  The company on Wednesday said production in Shanghai and for Model Y are ahead of schedule, with the latter expected to launch by the summer of 2020.  Tesla also has to contain costs as it develops a gigafactory in Europe, a Semi truck, an electric pickup truck, a new generation of the Tesla Roadster and automated driving features.  The carmaker said it had cut costs 16% on a yearly basis, citing improvements in operating efficiency and a reduction in manufacturing and material costs. Musk said on a conference call that operating costs were the lowest since Model 3 production started.  Margin expectations are higher for Model Y than Model 3, while productions costs are roughly the same as Model 3, said Zach Kirkhorn, Tesla chief financial officer.  Model 3 vehicles made in the Shanghai factory will have roughly the same margins as those made in Fremont, California, he said.  Tesla also expects to generally be cash flow positive as it has grown to the point of being self-funding. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/2MF6HHq)  That will allow the company to invest in divisions focusing on sustainable energy, including launching the third version of its solar roof tile this week.  \u201cFor about a year and a half we stripped Tesla energy of resources,\u201d Musk said. \u201cNow that Model 3 production is in a good place and headed to a great place we have restored resources to Tesla storage and solar. That\u2019s going to be really crazy growth.\u201d  Musk also said Tesla is open to supplying batteries and other components to other automakers.  With Wednesday\u2019s after-hours surge, Tesla\u2019s stock has reduced its loss year-to-date to 8% and added about $9 billion to its market capitalization.  But Tesla rallies have been short-lived before.  A year ago, Tesla gave a quarterly report that similarly smashed investors' expectations, igniting a rally that sent its shares 31% higher over the next two months, only to see the stock decline through much of 2019 over worries about corporate governance, profitability and demand for the Model 3. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/2PgxXgT)  Investors in the past have shown impatience with the company\u2019s serial failures to meet financial and production targets. Earlier this month, Tesla shares slumped after the company reported delivering 97,000 vehicles for the third quarter, only 2% ahead of the previous quarter.  But Tesla on Wednesday exceeded promises by billionaire Musk, who in July said Tesla would break even in the third quarter and turn a profit by the end of 2019.  The company has said it plans to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles for all of 2019, and on Wednesday said it was \u201chighly confident in exceeding 360,000 deliveries this year.\u201d  Analysts have questioned how rapidly Tesla\u2019s vehicle sales will grow as government subsidies for electric vehicle purchases dwindle in the United States, China and other markets.  Kirkhorn on Wednesday said Tesla saw growing order rates in all markets, with current quarter orders exceeding those of the past three months.  Tesla has said it aims to produce at least 1,000 Model 3 cars a week at the new Chinese factory by the end of this year, but it is unclear when it will meet year-end production targets due to uncertainties around orders, labor and suppliers.  Revenue fell nearly 8% to $6.30 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts had expected revenue of $6.33 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Tesla on Wednesday said it would gradually release nearly $500 million of accumulated revenue tied to its \u201cfull self-driving capabilities\u201d, which customers can buy for $6,000 even though fully automated driving is not available.  Kirkhorn on Wednesday said deferred revenue would also be released as Tesla expands its \u201cSmart Summon\u201d feature, which allows customers to operate a Tesla from 200 feet (60 meters) away using a smartphone app.  Federal safety regulators are looking into the feature after videos began appearing online showing driverless Teslas hitting obstacles or nearly hitting other vehicles.  Musk on Wednesday said software updates over the coming weeks would improve Summon.","1205":"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan\u2019s Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd (SMM) plans to focus on two key customers for its battery materials, Toyota Motor Corp and Panasonic Corp, supplier of car power packs to Tesla Inc, SMM\u2019s new president said.  Sumitomo Metal Mining Co's President Akira Nozaki poses for a photo after an interview with Reuters at the company's headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, September 13, 2018. REUTERS\/Ritsuko Shimizu  While Toyota and Panasonic are already SMM\u2019s biggest customers, rising sales of electric cars - led by Tesla\u2019s mass-market Model 3 - mean the Japanese miner and smelter is in a sweet spot it needs to protect.  SMM has spent 37 billion yen ($332 million) over the past four years to boost capacity of the nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) cathode materials used in Panasonic\u2019s lithium-ion battery that powers Tesla\u2019s Model 3 and Model X.  \u201cOur cathode material plants are running at full capacity,\u201d Akira Nozaki, president of Sumitomo Metal Mining, told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.  The company\u2019s monthly capacity of NCA cathode materials is due to reach 4,550 tonnes later this year, more than five times the monthly output of 850 tonnes in 2014, Nozaki said.  Tesla formally launched the Model 3 electric sedans in July 2017, and has attracted deposits from more than 500,000 potential customers.  After repeatedly pushing back internal targets, Tesla nearly hit its target of building 5,000 Model 3 per week for the first time in late June and \u201cmultiple times\u201d during July. It was targeting to produce 6,000 per week by late August.  \u201cWe see Tesla\u2019s production and sales have gotten into gear,\u201d Nozaki said.  Asked about any further expansion of its capacity, Nozaki said any decision will depend on consultations with Panasonic.  SMM, in which Toyota owns 3.8 percent stake, also supplies different types of cathode materials to batteries used in Toyota\u2019s hybrid cars such as the Prius.  Nozaki said his company will likely remain focused on its existing customers for now.  \u201cBattery materials are a custom-made product, not a commodity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to join hands with our customers to be able to respond changing needs for battery materials.\u201d  SMM, Japan\u2019s biggest nickel smelter, aims to boost its annual nickel output through smelting to 150,000 tonnes by March 2022 from 90,000 tonnes in March 2018.  It also plans to increase copper output from its equity holdings in mines to 300,000 tonnes from 260,000 tonnes, and gold output to 30 tonnes from 14 tonnes.  SMM, together with nickel miner PT Vale Indonesia, are conducting a feasibility study on a nickel smelting project in Pomalaa, Southeast Sulawesi, using high pressure acid leaching (HPAL) technology in which SMM has expertise.  If the smelter is given the go ahead, the Japanese company wants a majority stake in the project, Nozaki said.  The strength of SMM, founded as a copper smelter in 1590, lies in its integrated production from raw nickel up to electronic components including battery materials, unlike global resource majors, who tend to focus on mining or smelting, Nozaki said.  \u201cNickel smelters worldwide want to supply battery materials but they don\u2019t know what quality of nickel products they should offer, but we clearly understand those needs thanks to our supply chain,\u201d he said.

REUTERS\/Steve Marcus  The positive outlook comes after production troubles and delays at Tesla strained the company\u2019s partnership with Panasonic over the past few years.  Panasonic recently lost its status as Tesla\u2019s exclusive battery supplier, but has been able to turn around the U.S. joint battery business as demand for Tesla\u2019s electric cars soar.  Last month Tesla reported its third consecutive quarterly profit despite the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, taking investors by surprise.  \u201cWe are seeing strong demand from Tesla\u201d beyond the Nevada plant\u2019s current capacity of 35 gigawatt hours per year, Panasonic Chief Financial Officer Hirokazu Umeda told an earnings briefing on Monday. \u201cWe are in discussions right now\u201d about expanding the plant\u2019s capacity, he said.  The plant made a profit in January-March for the second consecutive quarter, he said.  Umeda hinted that Panasonic has been developing new batteries with Tesla. \u201cWe will be working to improve materials and technologies throughout this financial year,\u201d he said.  The Tesla battery business provided a bright spot in Panasonic\u2019s otherwise grim earnings, hit by plant closures and supply chain disruptions for its laptops, washing machines, automotive components and factory equipment.  The group\u2019s operating profit for the year ended in March dropped 29% to 294 billion yen ($2.7 billion).  Panasonic did not issue an earnings forecast for the current year due to uncertainty about the impact of the virus, joining a number of Japanese electronics companies, including Sony Corp 6758.T and Canon Inc 7751.T, in refraining from providing outlooks.  Analysts have forecast an average 225.46 billion yen profit for the current financial year.  The company has been cautious about expanding its partnership with Tesla, as its $1.6 billion investment in the Nevada factory, which began construction in 2014, failed to produce solid returns.

The Audi e-tron midsize SUV will be offered in the United States next year at a starting price of $75,795 before a $7,500 tax credit. It is one of a volley of electric vehicles coming from Volkswagen AG VOWG.DE brands, as well as other European premium brands including Daimler-owned DAIGn.DE Mercedes-Benz, BMW BMWG.DE, Volvo Cars and Jaguar Land Rover.  All aim to expand the market for premium electric vehicles and also to grab share of that market from Palo Alto, California-based Tesla, which has had the niche largely to itself.  \u201cI want Audi to be the number-one electric vehicle seller in America over the long term,\u201d Audi of America President Scott Keogh told Reuters in an interview on Monday.  Audi dealers, particularly those from California where Tesla has made significant inroads, cheered the e-tron at Monday night\u2019s crowded event. Analysts on Tuesday expressed concern that the vehicle\u2019s driving range may not measure up to the Tesla Model X.  Audi officials said they do not have official range estimates for the e-tron SUV under U.S. testing procedures. They said the vehicle should achieve a range under less rigorous European testing standards of roughly 250 miles or 400 km.  Keogh told attendees at Monday\u2019s event that an e-tron had made a 175-mile journey over the mountains east of San Francisco with range to spare. He also emphasized that the e-tron is designed to recharge more rapidly than rival electric vehicles.  UBS analyst Patrick Hummel said in a note on Tuesday that the e-tron \"fails to set new benchmarks in the premium EV segment, even though we consider it better than the Mercedes EQC.\" The EQC is a rival electric SUV the Daimler AG DAIGn.DE brand plans to launch in 2020.  The e-tron\u2019s 95 kWh battery has less capacity than the 100 kWh battery used in the Tesla Model X 100D model, but more than the base Model X 75D.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  The Model X 100D is rated at 295 miles (475 km) of range by the U.S. government.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who is also head of rocket company SpaceX, marked the e-tron launch by staging a SpaceX event in Los Angeles at roughly the same time on Monday evening as Audi\u2019s unveiling. At the SpaceX event, the company named its first private passenger on a planned voyage around the moon in 2023.  RECHARGING  Audi and parent Volkswagen are using the U.S. launch of the e-tron SUV in mid-2019 to take aim at one obstacle to expanding electric vehicle sales - the lack of convenient ways to recharge their batteries.  Audi will partner with online retailer Amazon to sell and install home electric vehicle charging systems to buyers of the e-tron, the companies said on Monday. Amazon will deliver the hardware and hire electricians to install them through its Amazon Home Services operation.  Amazon\u2019s partnership with Audi to provide home charging systems is the first time the online retailer has struck such a deal with an automaker, and signals a new front in Amazon\u2019s drive to expand its reach into consumers\u2019 homes beyond the presence of its Alexa smart speakers in living rooms and kitchens.  \u201cWe see charging installation as a very important business,\u201d Pat Bigatel, director of Amazon Home Services, told Reuters at Audi\u2019s launch event in San Francisco\u2019s Bill Graham Civic Center.  Audi executives said home charging stations would cost about $1,000, depending on the home\u2019s electrical system.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Tesla offers wall connectors for home charging at a $500 list price, and will arrange for installation, according to the company.  At the same time, Electrify America, a company funded by Volkswagen as part of its settlement of U.S. diesel emission cheating litigation, plans to launch next year the next round of installations of public charging stations, Electrify America executives told Reuters.  Tesla has developed its own network of Supercharger charging stations with more than 11,000 chargers in North America. Electrify America plans to have 2,000 chargers installed by mid-June next year. Those will be open to any vehicle, and customers can swipe a credit card to recharge.  \u201cWe want to work with all\u201d automotive brands, said Giovanni Palazzo, Electrify America\u2019s chief executive.  LIFTING THE CURTAIN  Audi has been heralding the launch of the e-tron SUV for some time, but until Monday it had not shared many details of the vehicle.  The e-tron is electric, and has two electric motors - one in the front and one in the rear - driving all four wheels. The Hungarian factory building motors for the e-tron will start with a production pace equivalent to 200 vehicles a day, Audi officials said.  In Europe, the vehicle will use cameras instead of conventional mirrors to give drivers a view to the rear. That feature is still not approved by U.S. regulators.  However, in many other respects the e-tron is a conventional, mainstream luxury SUV. It offers seating for five, and its length and wheelbase position it in the center of the market for midsize, five-passenger luxury SUVs such as the BMW X5. The e-tron is 5 inches (13 cm) shorter than the Tesla Model X, and it has conventional doors. The Model X uses vertically opening \u201cfalcon wing\u201d doors.  The e-tron will have an advanced cruise-control system that can keep the car within a lane and maintain a set distance behind another vehicle, but the system will be designed so that drivers must keep hands on the wheel.","1212":"(Repeats story that ran hours earlier, with no changes to text)  Aug 22 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk\u2019s contemplated $72 billion take-private deal is presenting investment bankers with a dilemma: overlook concerns about how feasible it is or risk missing out on what could be this year\u2019s biggest and most high-profile acquisition.  Musk did not just catch investors and analysts off guard earlier this month by announcing on Twitter he was considering taking the U.S. electric car maker private. He also sent shockwaves throughout the investment banking world, which reacted to the news with both excitement and bewilderment.  This is because no company of Tesla\u2019s size has ever been taken private by financial investors as Musk has suggested, as opposed to being acquired by a bigger company. Moreover, the standard method of doing so, saddling the company with debt in a so-called leveraged buyout, is not an option for Tesla given that is already servicing a debt mountain of some $11 billion and is not making any money. It reported an operating loss in 2017 of $1.6 billion.  Debate over the deal\u2019s feasibility has polarized bankers. During one conference call at an investment bank last week, discussion on whether the deal represented a major opportunity or a fools\u2019 errand degenerated into a shouting match, according to one of the bankers who provided the details on condition that neither he nor the bank, which decided not to pursue a role, are disclosed.  \u201cGiven the size of a deal, the company\u2019s debt capacity and cash flow, bankers seem similarly chary about this deal happening anytime soon,\u201d said Stefan Selig, a former top Bank of America Corp banker who is the founder of financial and strategic advisory firm BridgePark Advisors LLC, which is not involved in the deal.  Bankers aspiring to advise on the deal are courting Musk and Tesla\u2019s special board committee that will independently consider the merits of Musk\u2019s expected offer.  Working for Musk could also come with reputational risk, given that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the factual accuracy of his assertion on Twitter that funding for the deal was secured, sources have said.  However, many bankers said this would not be a deterrent given the magnitude of the potential deal.  \u201cThat\u2019s likely not enough to color a banker\u2019s view on whether or not there is an opportunity,\u201d said Ted Smith, a co-founder and partner of Union Square Advisors, a technology boutique investment bank. Union Square is not trying to win a role in the Tesla deal.  Musk, who owns about a fifth of Tesla, said in a blog post bit.ly\/2B9n7Ea last week the effective size of the deal would be much smaller than the $72 billion equity valuation of his offer, because, according to his estimate, two-thirds of the company's shareholders would choose the option he will offer them of \"rolling\" their stakes and continue to be investors in a private company, rather than cash out.  Musk also said that Saudi Arabia\u2019s PIF, which became a Tesla shareholder earlier this year with a stake of just under 5 percent, could help him fund the cash portion of the deal, through sources close to the secretive sovereign wealth fund have played down that prospect.  TROPHY DEAL  There is no precedent for major institutional shareholders and thousands of mom-and-pop investors rolling their stakes in a transaction of this size, and legal experts have warned that carrying this out would require navigating a regulatory minefield.  If the deal was structured like a leveraged buyout, advisers to Tesla could earn $90 million to $120 million in fees, while advisers to Musk\u2019s investor group would earn $30 million to $50 million, and debt financing fees could reach $500 million, according to estimates from financial advisory firm Freeman & Co.  However, if the Tesla deal is done with equity partners and little debt, as Musk envisions, the fees would be substantially lower, according to Freeman, making it more of a trophy rather than a lucrative assignment for bankers.  Last week, bankers at Goldman Sachs Group Inc decided to take the plunge by offering to advise Musk. Goldman bankers have had close ties with him for more than a decade, leading Tesla\u2019s initial public offering in 2010. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.  Morgan Stanley equity research analysts said on Tuesday they had ceased coverage of Tesla, and sources confirmed that the bank was also close to being hired by Musk.  Tesla has declined to comment on the matter.  This is despite Morgan Stanley currently advising aspiring Tesla rival Lucid Motors Inc on attracting a potential investment from PIF, sources told Reuters. Morgan Stanley has been a top financier of Tesla over the years, making it a prime candidate to arrange any debt financing needed, the sources said.  Morgan Stanley declined to comment.  Still up for grabs is the financial advisory mandate to be awarded by Tesla\u2019s special committee. Evercore Partners Inc , which advised Tesla two years ago in its $2.6 billion acquisition of renewable energy company SolarCity and is also advising PIF on its potential investment in Lucid Motors, is one of the banks vying to advise Tesla\u2019s special committee, according to the sources. Evercore declined to comment.  Other investment banks vying for the Tesla special committee financial advisory role include Centerview Partners, Lazard Ltd , Moelis & Co, and Perella Weinberg Partners LP, according to the sources. The banks did not respond to requests for comment.","1213":"FILE PHOTO: Elon Musk, founder, CEO and lead designer at SpaceX and co-founder of Tesla, speaks at the International Space Station Research and Development Conference in Washington, U.S., July 19, 2017.

FILE PHOTO: A Volkswagen oldtimer car drives past a Tesla Model X electric car recharging batteries in Berlin, Germany, November 13, 2019. REUTERS\/Fabrizio Bensch\/File Photo  Now the Tesla CEO is trying to tap that German automation ecosystem directly with Tuesday\u2019s announcement that the electric carmaker will build a European car and battery factory near Berlin.  So far, Musk has failed in his plans to create a factory so highly automated that it allows Tesla to make cars more efficiently than much bigger rivals. As a result, the automaker has struggled to meet production goals and been hit with defections of key staff members to rival firms.  The new German factory is designed to help change all that.  \u201cEveryone knows German engineering is outstanding for sure. You know that is part of the reason why we are locating Gigafactory Europe in Germany,\u201d Musk said at a prestigious German car awards ceremony in Berlin late on Tuesday.  BMW BMWG.DE has a factory in Leipzig, where it builds its i3 electric vehicle and it will source battery cells from a factory in Erfurt run by China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL) 300750.SZ..  VW is retooling a plant in Zwickau to build 330,000 electric cars and German engineering giant Siemens AG SIEGn.DE, which has an industrial and technology hub in Berlin, last week said it met with Musk to discuss projects in the area of advanced manufacturing and car charging.  German carmakers and suppliers are tapping in to a 1 billion euro ($1.10 billion) fund set up by Germany to increase battery cell production and are further aided by a government-funded research facility to increase battery cell development know-how.  PRODUCTION GOAL  Tesla has yet to meet its goal of building more than 500,000 Model 3 cars by 2018. That goal was set back in 2016 and since then Tesla\u2019s production guru, Peter Hochholdinger, a former Audi production expert, quit to joined rival Lucid.  This year Tesla expects to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars, a target that includes selling all models.  By contrast, the Volkswagen brand delivered 6.24 million cars last year and is readying its global production network to build 22 million electric cars by 2028.  To ramp up manufacturing, Tesla started making its Model 3 in a tent, but the California-built cars often failed to meet German quality standards.  In August, German car rental company Nextmove walked away from a 5 million-euro ($5.55 million) order for 85 Tesla Model 3 electric vehicles, following a dispute over how to fix quality issues.  POTENTIAL FOR AUTOMATION  Although Tesla has chosen a high-cost location, there is higher potential for automation with electric cars since they are less complex to build than combustion engined vehicles.  A combustion engined car has 1,400 components in the motor, exhaust system and transmission. By contrast, an electric car\u2019s battery and motor has only 200 components, according to analysts at ING.  While the average combustion engine takes 3.5 hours to make, and the average transmission requires 2.7 hours of assembly, an electric motor takes only about 1 hour to assemble, consultants at Alix Partners said in their Global Automotive Outlook study.  \u201cPersonnel is not a high cost factor in the production of electric cars,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said.  Today the biggest cost factor is still battery packs, which amount to between 30% and 50% of the cost of an electric vehicle.  QUALITY VS SCALE  By adding the \u201cMade in Germany\u201d quality, Tesla could significantly boost sales of its electric cars, which are already class-leading.  On Tuesday Tesla\u2019s Model 3 was awarded the \u201cGolden Steering Wheel\u201d by Germany\u2019s Auto Bild magazine, with jury member Robin Horning saying the Model 3 had beaten the new BMW 3 series and the Audi A4 in \u201cmid and premium class\u201d category.  Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess congratulated Musk on winning the prize.  \u201cI want to congratulate you. With all this competition in Germany it is a great achievement,\u201d he said at the awards ceremony. \u201cI thank you for pioneering, for pulling us and pushing us. Elon is the innovator.\u201d","1216":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Friday it would cut thousands of jobs to rein in costs as it plans to increase production of lower-priced versions of its crucial Model 3 sedan, sending its shares down as much as 10 percent.  The company, which has struggled to achieve long-term profitability and keep a tight lid on expenses, also said it expects fourth-quarter profit to be lower than the preceding quarter.  Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said the need for lower-priced versions of Model 3 will become even greater from July, when the U.S. tax credit again drops in half, adding $1,875 to the car\u2019s price tag, and again at the end of the year when it goes away entirely.  The phase-out of the electric vehicle tax break confronts Tesla with the choice of raising prices at the risk of losing customers or slashing costs by thousands of dollars per vehicle, a herculean task for an automaker.  Musk also faces a narrowing window in which his electric luxury vehicles enjoy a monopoly in the segment that Tesla created and defined. Over the next several years, established automakers plan to spend nearly $300 billion on electric vehicles and batteries.  Legacy luxury brands such as Volkswagen's VOWG_p.DE Audi and Porsche, Daimler's Mercedes-Benz and BMW all plan new luxury electric vehicles.  Chinese startups such as Byton and NIO are pushing ahead with technically advanced electric vehicles, building on China\u2019s aggressive support for cleaner cars. Most analysts expect China will be the world\u2019s largest electric vehicle market.  Musk said on Friday the company would need to deliver at least the mid-range Model 3 version in all markets starting around May, as it needs to reach more customers who can afford the vehicles.  Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Autotrader, said she expected the year to be challenging for all automakers as new vehicle sales slow.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cIt will be especially challenging for Tesla as it desperately tries to rack up more quarterly profits after having one in the third quarter, and it faces an onslaught of competitors in the next couple of years,\u201d she said.  The billionaire entrepreneur has been under intense pressure to stabilize production of the Model 3, a car that was unveiled in early 2016 to great fanfare and is seen critical to the company\u2019s long-term viability.  But Tesla has scrambled to get the Model 3 into the hands of customers, many of whom have been waiting since early 2016, and Musk said last year that Tesla had moved from \u201cproduction hell to delivery logistics hell.\u201d  This is Tesla\u2019s second job cut in seven months and comes just days after it cut U.S. prices for all vehicles and fell short on quarterly deliveries of its mass-market Model 3 sedan.  In a memo to employees on Friday, Musk said 2018 was the \u201cmost challenging in Tesla\u2019s history,\u201d adding the company hired 30 percent more employees last year which was more than it could support.  \u201cI want to make sure that you know all the facts and figures and understand that the road ahead is very difficult,\u201d Musk said.  \u201cThere isn\u2019t any other way.\u201d  Tesla sales benefited from a $7,500 federal tax credit on electric vehicles throughout 2018, but that full credit expired at the end of 2018, and new buyers will now receive only half that amount.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The company reported a profit of $311.5 million, or $1.75 per share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, which Musk called Tesla\u2019s \u201cfirst meaningful profit\u201d since the company started.  For the fourth quarter, analysts on average expect the company\u2019s net income to be $216.92 million on a reported basis. The estimate shrinks further in first quarter to $62.80 million, according to Refinitiv data.  \u201cThis quarter, as with Q3, shipment of higher priced Model 3 variants (this time to Europe and Asia) will hopefully allow us, with great difficulty, effort and some luck, to target a tiny profit,\u201d Musk said.  Musk, who has often set goals and deadlines that Tesla has failed to meet, surprised investors by delivering on his pledge to make the company profitable in the third quarter, for only the third time in its 15-year existence.  The electric carmaker said on Friday it would reduce full-time employee headcount by about 7 percent and retain only the most critical temps and contractors.  In June, Tesla said it was cutting 9 percent of its workforce. Musk had tweeted in October that the company employed 45,000 people.

Tesla vehicles are shown on a delivery truck in Los Angeles, California, September 27. 2019. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  If the accidents pile up, though, Tesla itself is sure to be brought into a legal fight, insurance industry experts said.  The incidents highlight a shifting landscape for long-held assumptions about auto insurance and accident blame as more car manufacturers offer features that can automate parallel parking, avoid collisions, and take over steering during traffic, among other things.  A Tesla software update last week added a so-called Smart Summon feature for some customers. When the car is within 200 feet and in their line of sight, they can use a phone app to summon the vehicle in a parking lot. Users start the car by holding down a button and stop the car by releasing it, Tesla said in instructions, warning users to be careful.  U.S. regulators are looking into parking lot crashes involving Tesla cars driving themselves to their owners, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Wednesday.  \u201cThis was an interesting one to explain to my insurance,\u201d wrote one user in YouTube and Twitter video posts of a Tesla scraping against a garage door frame while exiting in summon mode. \u201cSilly feature cost me time and money.\u201d  Tesla did not respond to a request for comment but Chief Executive Elon Musk on Wednesday tweeted that there were more than 550,000 Smart Summon uses in the first few days.  Insurance claims for such incidents will go through the car owner\u2019s traditional auto coverage, said Jennifer Dukarski, a lawyer in Ann Arbor, Michigan, who represents automotive suppliers in disputes about safety and autonomous car technology.  \u201cBut as the number of incidents build, you\u2019ll find someone who will entertain a class action [lawsuit] dealing with a product defect,\u201d Dukarski said.  Automated features also raise the question of whether the owner or the auto manufacturer is at fault when accidents occur.  \u201cThe rationale for the owner being responsible is that the laws have not caught up to autonomous vehicles,\u201d said Keith McKenna, an insurance lawyer in New York who represents corporate policyholders.  If fully-automated cars someday becomes the norm, liability will shift to manufacturers and their insurance, McKenna said.  The technology is not sophisticated enough to be deemed \u201cdriverless\u201d under California\u2019s motor vehicle rules, the California Department of Motor Vehicles said, essentially leaving the app user outside of the car responsible for accidents.  Still, limitations to the app and other features make Tesla more responsible when accidents occur, said Mike Morgan, a Florida personal injury lawyer. His firm sued Tesla last year on behalf of a client who blames Tesla for his car crashing into a disabled vehicle.  \u201cYou are still responsible for your car and must monitor it and its surroundings at all times and be within your line of sight because it may not detect all obstacles,\u201d Tesla said in instructions for the new feature.  But it may be too late to avoid a crash when a user attempts to stop the car, Morgan said.  \u201cThese vehicles provide a false sense of human control,\u201d Morgan said.","1220":"(Reuters) - Shares of Tesla Inc jumped by almost 18 percent on Monday as Chief Executive Elon Musk settled a lawsuit that had threatened to force him out and said a surge in third-quarter production had driven it to the verge of profitability.

Instead, under a settlement announced at the weekend, Tesla and Musk will pay $20 million each to the regulator and Musk will step down as chairman but stay as CEO, keeping one of America\u2019s best-known corporate figures in place.

As part of the settlement with the SEC, Tesla will also appoint an independent chairman and two independent directors, responding to calls on Wall Street to relieve the pressure on Musk and provide more balance in the carmaker\u2019s management.  \u201cThis is one of the best cases for appointing an independent chair we have seen in a while,\u201d said Courteney Keatinge, research director for proxy adviser Glass, Lewis & Co.  \u201cHis behavior hasn\u2019t been great for a while. And I think this kind of behavior has a ripple effect, when there isn\u2019t steady leadership at the top.\u201d  Lawyers said the settlement and size of the fine might give more ammunition to short-sellers pursuing separate cases against Musk for manipulating company shares through the Aug. 7 tweet, as well as to a probe by the Justice Department.  But several experienced litigators also said that, while the DOJ probe is separate, the SEC\u2019s settlement might mark the end of official action against Tesla and Musk.  \u201cThe standard of proof for any potential criminal charge is higher than that of a civil case, which the SEC had,\u201d said Jay Dubow, a former branch chief in the SEC\u2019s enforcement division.  \u201cIt is possible that the DOJ investigation does not result in any criminal charges at least in part because the DOJ could determine that the SEC\u2019s action resolved the matter and that no further governmental action is required.\u201d  Neither Musk nor Tesla admitted or denied the SEC\u2019s findings under the settlement, which still must be approved by a court.","1221":"NEW YORK, Feb 26 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday ordered Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk to explain by March 11 why he should not be held in contempt for violating his fraud settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Lawyers for Tesla and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Tesla did not immediately respond to similar requests. The SEC declined to comment.  Analysts said the renewal of the public battle between Musk and the top U.S. securities regulator will be an overhang on Tesla\u2019s stock, which has lost about one-quarter of its value since peaking in August.  \u201cAnother boxing match with the SEC is the last thing investors wanted to see,\u201d wrote Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who has an \u201coutperform\u201d rating on Tesla.  He called the latest incident \u201ca wild card that could potentially bring this tornado of uncertainty back into the Tesla story until resolved.\u201d  Tesla shares were up 0.8 percent at $301.13 around midday on Tuesday on the Nasdaq. They had fallen as much as 3.3 percent earlier.  SEC SAYS TWEETS NOT VETTED  The SEC contempt motion followed Musk\u2019s tweet to his more than 24 million Twitter followers on Feb. 19: \u201cTesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019,\u201d meaning 500,000 vehicles.  According to the SEC, Musk violated his October 2018 settlement agreement by sending that tweet without first seeking approval from Tesla\u2019s lawyers.  It also said the outlook contrasted with guidance that Tesla had given on Jan. 30 that it would deliver about 400,000 vehicles in 2019.  The settlement resolved an SEC lawsuit over another Twitter post in which Musk said he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take his Palo Alto, California-based company private at $420 per share.  Musk agreed to step down as Tesla\u2019s chairman, and both he and Tesla agreed to pay $20 million civil fines.  Four hours after his Feb. 19 tweet, Musk corrected himself, saying annualized production would probably be around 500,000 by year end, with full-year deliveries totaling 400,000.  Bradley Bondi, a lawyer for Tesla, had told the SEC in a Feb. 22 letter that Musk thought the substance of his first tweet had been \u201cappropriately vetted, pre-approved, and publicly disseminated.\u201d  POTENTIAL PUNISHMENT  It is not clear what punishment the SEC will seek.  The regulator could seek a higher fine, further restrictions on Musk\u2019s activities, or removal of him from Tesla\u2019s board.  Alternatively, it could seek to ban Musk from being a public company officer, which would force him to step down as Tesla\u2019s chief executive.  It also is not clear how Musk\u2019s public criticism of the SEC might weigh on his fate.  The criticism continued on Tuesday, when Musk tweeted in the early morning: \u201cSomething is broken with SEC oversight.\u201d  That followed his Monday night tweet, after the contempt motion was filed, that the \u201cSEC forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript, which clearly states 350k to 500k,\u201d and added: \u201cHow embarrassing.\u201d  Musk appeared to be referring to his Jan. 30 comment to analysts that Tesla would produce \u201cmaybe on the order of 350,000 to 500,000 Model 3s, something like that this year.\u201d  Criticizing the SEC is nothing new for Musk.  He has called the regulator the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission,\u201d recalling his attacks against hedge funds and other investors who sell Tesla stock short, hoping it will fall.  And in a December interview with CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Musk said he did not have respect for the SEC. He also said his tweets had not been reviewed in advance since the settlement.","1222":"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea\u2019s LG Chem Ltd, an electric vehicle (EV) battery supplier for Tesla and a petrochemicals maker, said on Monday its third-quarter operating profit likely jumped to a record high, beating analysts\u2019 estimates.  The company did not elaborate on the reasons for its upbeat outlook but analysts attributed it to orders from Tesla and the coronavirus pandemic that lifted demand for home appliances - one of the applications for petrochemicals products.  LG Chem estimated that its operating profit jumped 159% to 902 billion won ($788.94 million) in the quarter ended September, above the 746 billion won analyst forecast by Refinitiv SmartEstimate.  Revenue likely rose 9% to 7.5 trillion won from a year earlier, the company said.  The firm is expected to release detailed earnings later this month.  LG Chem, along with China\u2019s CATL, supplies batteries for Tesla\u2019s electric cars made in Shanghai. Tesla posted record quarterly deliveries in the third quarter.  Analysts expect LG Chem\u2019s battery business to remain profitable in the third quarter and its mainstay petrochemicals business to post solid profits.  Despite the rosy outlook, LG Chem shares fell 2.3% over concerns of fire risks associated with its battery cells for Hyundai Motor\u2019s Kona electric vehicles.  LG Chem said faulty battery cells were not the cause of fires in Kona EVs, and the exact cause had not been determined.  Tesla\u2019s long-term plan to produce its own cells have hurt LG Chem shares, which had rallied this year due to EV expectations.  LG Chem shares also have been under pressure after it said last month that it plans to separate its battery business as an independent unit.  ($1 = 1,143.3100 won)","1223":"WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Elon Musk\u2019s expected defense of a $2.2 billion deal in court was postponed on Friday from its expected Monday start, due to the coronavirus outbreak.  A new trial date has not be set.  The case relates to Tesla\u2019s purchase of SolarCity in 2016, a deal that was criticized by shareholders as benefiting Musk at the expense of Tesla Inc, and the outcome may depend as much on the chief executive\u2019s temperament as on the facts of the case.  The electric vehicle maker\u2019s unconventional CEO has shown two sides in recent court proceedings -- one polite and respectful, the other evasive and taunting.  It remains to be seen which Musk will show up at a Delaware court, the nation\u2019s leader on corporate issues, when he squares off against union pension funds and asset managers who claim they were misled about the benefits of Tesla buying SolarCity in 2016 for $2.2 billion.  Getting it wrong could cost Musk more than $1 billion.  \u201cIf you seem arrogant in court, you may be signing your own economic death warrant,\u201d said John Coffee, a securities professor at Columbia Law School.  This may be particularly true in Delaware\u2019s Court of Chancery, with roots in medieval England and known for its decorum.  Musk and his lawyers did not respond to a request for comment.  FILE PHOTO: SpaceX owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk arrives on the red carpet for the automobile awards \"Das Goldene Lenkrad\" given by a German newspaper in Berlin, Germany, November 12, 2019. REUTERS\/Hannibal Hanschke\/File Photo  Smashing corporate norms has come to define Musk, who has a cult-like following for his ambitious vision, battles with short-sellers and disdain for \u201cboring bonehead questions\u201d from analysts.  In the Delaware case, shareholders claim SolarCity, a rooftop solar energy company, was secretly on the brink of bankruptcy when Tesla purchased it. They argue the deal benefited Musk, SolarCity\u2019s largest shareholder, his cousins who co-founded the firm, and Tesla directors who owned stakes in SolarCity.  Investors want Musk to surrender the 2.2 million shares of Tesla he received in the deal, which on Thursday were worth about $1.2 billion.  Musk has countered that Tesla\u2019s stock has tripled since the deal, demonstrating its value. SolarCity has withered because its staff were redirected toward launching the Model 3 sedan, a make-or-break product for Tesla, not because the solar business lacked value, according to Musk.  The Tesla directors who approved the deal settled allegations against themselves in January for $60 million, which was paid from insurance. They denied wrongdoing.  Musk has dug in his heels.  During a June deposition, Musk clashed with shareholder lawyer Randy Baron, calling him \u201creprehensible,\u201d doubting his emotional well-being and avoiding many questions.  He went on tangents about Tesla\u2019s solar potential, lamented both the decline of U.S. manufacturing and the large size of the legal industry and asked Baron if he was only motivated by money. Baron declined to comment.  In contrast, at a defamation trial in December, Musk donned a dark suit, spoke softly on the witness stand, and apologized to the cave rescuer who sued Musk for calling him a \u201cpedo guy\u201d on Twitter.  Musk portrayed himself as overworked, hounded by critics and earnest in his desire to help in the rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave in Thailand.  The strategy appeared to pay off when a jury ruled in Musk\u2019s favor and rejected the $190 million claim against him.  The SolarCity case will be decided by Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights.  The court has its own cult-like following for its scholarly opinions that often run more than 100 pages and which have shaped Corporate America.  \u201cThe big question is when you get an institution like him and an institution like the Court of Chancery, is it oil and water or is it mutual respect?\u201d said Larry Hamermesh, a professor at Delaware Law School.  Executives often struggle with testimony because they think of themselves as the smartest in the room, according to University of Pennsylvania Law School Professor Jill Fisch.  \u201cThat works against them in depositions and is even worse in court. It tends to piss off a judge,\u201d said Fisch.  David Murdock, the CEO of Dole Food Co Inc, went to Delaware to defend his 2013 buyout of the fruit company, and sunk himself with bizarre, rambling and combative testimony. He was ordered to pay former shareholders $148 million.  \u201cBy dint of his prodigious wealth and power, he has grown accustomed to deference,\u201d wrote the judge, Vice Chancellor Travis Laster, of Murdock. \u201cThat habit serves a witness poorly when he faces a skilled cross-examiner.\u201d","1224":"May 9 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's chief executive Elon Musk tweeted here on Saturday that Tesla will move its headquarters and future programs to Texas or Nevada from California immediately.  \u201cIf we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen (sp) on how Tesla is treated in the future,\u201d he wrote on Twitter, referring to the facility in the San Francisco Bay area that is Tesla\u2019s only U.S. vehicle factory.  Musk also tweeted about suing Alameda County, California, after its health department said the electric carmaker must not reopen the Fremont factory as local lockdown measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus remain in effect.  Musk had told employees on Thursday that limited production would restart at Fremont on Friday afternoon.  California Governor Gavin Newsom said on Thursday that manufacturers in the state would be allowed to reopen. But Alameda County, where the factory is located, is scheduled to remain shut until the end of May with only essential businesses allowed to reopen.  A county official said on Friday that its health department has had many discussions with the company and recommended that Tesla wait at least another week to monitor infection rates and discuss safe ways to resume production.  Musk, who sparred with California officials in March over whether Tesla had to halt production at Fremont, has criticized the lockdown and stay-at-home orders, calling them a \u201cserious risk\u201d to U.S. business and \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d (Reporting by Sabahatjahan Contractor in Bengaluru; Editing by Daniel Wallis)","1225":"FILE PHOTO: Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk introduces the falcon wing door on the Model X electric sports-utility vehicles during a presentation in Fremont, California September 29, 2015.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Electrek did not give any delivery number for international markets for the quarter.  It has over 12,000 additional orders as well and Tesla could end the quarter by delivering 61,000 vehicles in North America, the report said here, citing sources inside the company.","1227":"March 18 (Reuters) - A tweet about Tesla Inc production targets by Elon Musk was \u201ca blatant violation\u201d of a court order to get his written communications pre-approved, U.S. securities regulators told a judge on Monday, doubling down on the government\u2019s demand to find the Tesla CEO in contempt of a previous fraud settlement.  The Securities and Exchange Commission wrote in a filing in federal court in Manhattan that Musk\u2019s Feb. 19 tweet to his more than 24 million Twitter followers claiming the electric vehicle-maker would build around 500,000 cars in 2019 contained or could have contained information material to Tesla or its shareholders.  The ongoing public battle between Tesla\u2019s chief executive and the top U.S. securities regulator adds pressure on Musk, the public face of Tesla, who is struggling to make the company profitable after cutting the price of its Model 3 sedan to $35,000.  The regulator last month alleged that Musk had violated a September settlement of fraud charges by tweeting material information about Tesla without pre-approval from the company.  In response, Musk had argued that his \u201csingle, immaterial\u201d tweet was in compliance with the settlement, and that the SEC\u2019s push to find him in contempt infringed on his free speech..  The fraud settlement between Musk, Tesla and the SEC resolved a lawsuit brought by the regulator over claims Musk made on Twitter in August that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The SEC called those tweets \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d and a go-private deal never materialized.  As part of that settlement, Musk stepped down as the company\u2019s chairman and he and Tesla agreed to pay $20 million each in fines.  He also agreed to submit written communications that could materially impact Tesla for pre-approval to the company before publishing them.  \u201cIt is therefore stunning to learn that, at the time of filing of the instant motion, Musk had not sought pre-approval for a single one of the numerous tweets about Tesla he published in the months since the court-ordered pre-approval policy went into effect,\u201d the SEC said in Monday\u2019s filing.  Tesla has backed off a plan to close all its U.S. stores and said it will instead raise prices of its higher-end vehicles by about 3 percent on average. Last week, Tesla unveiled its Model Y crossover SUV, targeted to begin production in 2020.  Musk called the regulator the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission\u201d on Twitter after the settlement, and tweeted that \u201csomething is broken with SEC oversight\u201d just one day after the agency started pursuing the contempt order.  Legal experts have said the SEC could pursue multiple avenues, including a higher fine, imposing further restrictions on Musk\u2019s activities or removing him from Tesla\u2019s board or helm.  Tesla published a new communications policy in December for senior executives as part of the settlement. It called for Tesla\u2019s general counsel and a newly designated in-house securities law attorney to pre-approve any written statements about Tesla that could be material.  A disclosure controls committee, made up of board members Brad Buss, Antonio Gracias and James Murdoch, was tasked with overseeing compliance with the new policy.

Straubel, was stepping down from his role as chief technology officer.  A quarterly loss was deeper than expected, and despite record deliveries in the quarter, revenue came in lighter than analysts\u2019 expectations. Moreover, margins - a focus of investors - narrowed in the quarter, adding to Tesla\u2019s challenges in delivering profit going forward.  Shares fell 11.5% after hours and extended losses after the announcement about Straubel, a founding engineer who will become a senior adviser.  Under pressure to meet his repeated promises to make Tesla sustainably profitable, Chief Executive Elon Musk is trying to contain costs while still spending on major initiatives from a Shanghai factory and assembly-line to upcoming models such as the Model Y SUV and a Semi commercial truck.  Tesla initially promised to be profitable in the third quarter of 2018 and has now pushed back that target multiple times. Now profit is expected in the fourth quarter of 2019, with the current quarter to be break-even, Musk said.  In a statement on Wednesday, Tesla said it was focusing less on profit and more on volume growth, capacity expansion and cash generation. Musk said the company had grown to the point of \u201cbeing self-funding,\u201d indicating he might not need another cash infusion following a record-setting capital raising earlier this year.  Tesla said on Wednesday it had trimmed its capital expenditure target for 2019 to $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion, from $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion. It ended the quarter with $5 billion in cash and cash equivalents.  Investing.com analyst Clement Thibault told Reuters that Tesla\u2019s results \u201cwill inevitably lead to more questions about its ability to stabilize and turn a profit.\u201d  Tasked with Tesla\u2019s groundbreaking battery technology since Tesla\u2019s early beginnings, Straubel directed the development of the audacious plan to make a sportscar powered by bundled laptop batteries. The quiet, retiring Straubel has been seen as a good partner for showy Musk. Straubel had been the last senior executive of long-standing at the very top rank of the company to remain at Tesla.  FILE PHOTO: A Tesla logo on a Model S is photographed inside of a Tesla dealership in New York, U.S., April 29, 2016. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  Even while growing, Tesla has laid off workers and pledged to close some stores to lower costs. Facing increased competition from a slew of European rivals with electric offerings, it has also tinkered with its pricing.  Most recently, it eliminated the least expensive versions of its Model S sedan and Model X SUV, while cutting the starting price of its Model 3 to $38,990.  Tesla\u2019s strong second-quarter deliveries assuaged doubts about demand for the Model 3, but concerns linger, especially since a federal tax credit was cut by half on July 1 and expires at the end of the year.  Many analysts note that Tesla will be challenged not only to meet its deliveries target of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles this year, but to keep profit margins from further eroding.  Automotive gross margins dropped in the quarter from 20% to 19%.  Musk gave bold predictions for the long-term demand for the Model 3 and upcoming Model Y combined, saying that it could reach 2 million vehicles per year.  The company repeated a target of producing 10,000 vehicles per week globally by the end of 2019.  Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn said orders in the current quarter were so far higher than those seen in the second quarter.  A 58.7% revenue rise to $6.35 billion in the quarter fell short of the $6.41 billion estimated by analysts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, even as a non-GAAP loss of $1.12 per share was deeper than the loss of 36 cents they expected.  Shares of Tesla are down 22% since the beginning of the year, but they have been rebounding since early June, after hitting their lowest close since early 2016 at $178.97.","1230":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Is it too late to join the Tesla party?

The company\u2019s formal entry into the S&P 500 on Monday is expected to generate unprecedented activity near the close of trade on Friday as index-tracking funds load up on shares so their portfolios correctly reflect the index.  Still, Wall Street is divided over whether Tesla\u2019s days of heady gains are numbered.  Overall, Wall Street analysts have long been skeptical of Tesla. The 35 analysts tracked by Refinitiv have an average price target of $396.30 per share, which would represent a 36% decline from its current price. Yet in a sign of how split Wall Street is on the stock, target prices range from a high of $774 per share by Elazar Advisors to a low of $40 by GLJ Research.  Tesla closed Thursday at $655.90.  Some long-term investors say that they still expect to see Tesla post above-average gains due to increasing adoption rates in the global electric vehicle market and its solar energy business. At the same time, investors remain convinced that billionaire Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, will continue to push the company\u2019s disruptive technology ahead of its competitors.  \u201cIt\u2019s become clear this year just how far ahead of the competition the company is in terms of not only its technological abilities but its combination of range and performance at an affordable price,\u201d said Gary Robinson, portfolio manager of the Baillie Gifford US Equity Growth fund, who owns the stock.  Tesla will likely prove to have a more profitable business model than its rivals and post accelerating growth rates in its solar business, allowing its stock to more than double over the next 5 years, he said.  Overall, Tesla trades at 175 times its estimated earnings per share over the next 12 months, compared with valuations at 14 times estimated earnings per share for BMW and 16 times estimates earnings for Toyota Motor Corp, according to a research note from JP Morgan.  At the same time, Tesla is expected to earn $2.29 per share on $30.8 billion in revenue during its current fiscal year, while General Motors is expected to earn $4.67 per share on $120.7 billion in revenue, according to Refinitiv.  Its inclusion in the S&P will push the forward price to earnings ratio of the S&P 500 index up an additional 0.4 times to near its highest valuation in history, according to a note from Goldman Sachs.  \u201cTesla\u2019s multiple of earnings is very high in nominal terms for any company in any industry at any time in history,\u201d the firm noted, keeping its $80 price target on the company\u2019s shares.  Despite the stock\u2019s high valuations, some long-term investors say that they are sticking with the company. \u201cNear term valuations tend to be less meaningful over time when you invest in right teams,\u201d said Anthony Zackery, a portfolio manager at Zevenbergen Capital Investments.  Bears still abound in Tesla, focusing on Musk\u2019s track record of missed production targets, and on corporate governance risk after Musk was forced to step down as chairman to settle fraud charges in 2018.  Despite handing short sellers $33.8 billion in mark-to-market losses since the start of the year, Tesla remains the company with the most total money bet against it in the U.S. market, according to S3 Partners.  \u201cAt some point you do short the stock because this is probably the last big move for a while for Tesla,\u201d said Charles Lemonides, portfolio manager of ValueWorks LLC, who does not currently have a position in the company.  \u201cUp until now betting against Tesla has been a very dangerous thing to do, but it may get to a place where it\u2019s completely overextended,\u201d he added.","1231":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc and officials in California have resolved their acrimonious clash over safety procedures at the automaker\u2019s sole U.S. assembly plant with a deal that allows production to resume as early as Monday, county officials said.  The county said the automaker could take additional steps ahead of next week after Chief Executive Elon Musk had vowed to defy authorities, saying Monday he was resuming production despite the prohibition. On Tuesday, he also won the backing of President Donald Trump.  In a tweet, Alameda County said that following talks with Tesla it agreed that the electric carmaker can take steps \u201cin preparation for possible reopening as soon as next week.\u201d  Tesla did not immediately comment Wednesday but around the same time the county issued its statement, Musk tweeted: \u201cLife should be lived.\u201d  Tesla\u2019s sole U.S. electric vehicle assembly plant is in Fremont, California, which is in Alameda County.

At the Fremont factory\u2019s outbound logistics parking lot, where only a dozen Tesla cars were parked last week, hundreds of Tesla vehicles were seen on Tuesday.  The company had sued Alameda County challenging its decision that the plant should stay closed.  A county health official on Friday said the county had asked all manufacturers, including Tesla, to delay operations by at least another week to monitor infection and hospitalization rates.  Tesla on Saturday released a plan to keep workers returning to the factory safe.  The measures, which include temperature screenings, the installation of barriers to separate work areas and protective equipment for workers, are similar to those set up by Detroit-based automakers General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler. Those automakers are set to resume at most U.S. auto plants starting Monday.  Trump is eager for the U.S. economy to reopen and for Americans to return to work.  Musk over the weekend threatened to leave California for Texas or Nevada over his factory\u2019s closure. His move has highlighted the competition for jobs and ignited a rush to woo the billionaire executive by states that have reopened their economies more quickly in response to encouragement from Trump.  Last month, Musk was on a call with Trump and other chief executives to discuss the reopening of the U.S. economy in which Musk said he wanted to be able to resume production by May 1 or earlier, a person briefed on the call confirmed. Details of the call were reported earlier by the Washington Post.  Musk\u2019s fight with local authorities has gotten the attention of those who scout sites for new factories and corporate offices, as well as economic development officials hungry for more jobs.  Since the disagreement between Tesla and Alameda County gained national attention, officials from such states as Texas, Nevada, Georgia, Utah and Oklahoma have pitched Musk about considering their state.

The Fremont factory employs more than 10,000 people, according to the automaker.","1232":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk has reached a deal with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to settle a dispute over his use of Twitter, agreeing to submit his public statements about the company\u2019s finances and other topics to vetting by its legal counsel, according to a court filing on Friday.  If it is approved by a judge, the deal means the Tesla founder no longer faces the prospect of being held in contempt for violating an earlier settlement with the agency, which had required him to submit statements \u201cmaterial\u201d to investors for prior review.  The new agreement, disclosed in a filing in Manhattan federal court, lays out in more detail exactly what kinds of statements must be reviewed.  Shares of Tesla rose 1.4 percent to $238.50 in after hours trading. The agreement lifts a cloud that has hung over Musk as Tesla tries to ramp up production of its most important vehicle, the Model 3 sedan, and make a profit at the same time.  \u201cIt could really have turned out far worse for him,\u201d said Stephen Diamond, a professor of securities law at Santa Clara University. \u201cThe consequences of thumbing his nose at the SEC could have been far worse for him and the company.\u201d  Tesla has struggled with logistics difficulties in delivering its Model 3 to global customers, a declining share price and lingering questions about the sustainability of demand. Earlier this week, the electric vehicle maker posted a $702 million loss, and warned of a loss in the second quarter.  Musk\u2019s lawyer did not immediately return a request for comment.  TWEET APPROVAL  The SEC sued Musk last year after he tweeted on Aug. 7 that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The agency said the tweet, which sent Tesla\u2019s share price up as much as 13.3 percent, violated securities laws. Musk\u2019s privatization plan was at best in an early stage and financing was not in place.  FILE PHOTO: Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk (C) exits after attending a S.E.C. hearing at the Manhattan Federal Courthouse in New York, April 4, 2019. REUTERS\/Eduardo Munoz  Musk settled the lawsuit, agreeing to step down as chairman and have the company\u2019s lawyers pre-approve written communications, including tweets with material information about the company.  In February, the SEC accused Musk of violating that settlement by sending a tweet about Tesla\u2019s production numbers that had not been vetted by the company\u2019s attorneys, and asked U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan to hold him in contempt.  At an April 4 court hearing, the judge declined to rule on the contempt motion and told the SEC and Musk to work out their differences and come to a settlement.  Musk\u2019s lawyers have argued that the February tweet did not contain new information that was material to investors, and that Musk did not need pre-approval for all tweets about Tesla under the settlement.  They also argued the settlement was too ambiguous for Musk to be held in contempt.  The new agreement unveiled Friday addresses that ambiguity by listing what kinds of statements must be vetted. They include statements about Tesla\u2019s financial condition, proposed or potential deals, production numbers, performance projections, financing or lending arrangements and Musk\u2019s own transactions in the company\u2019s securities.  It also gives the company\u2019s board of directors the right to seek preapproval about additional topics if they believe doing so would protect shareholders\u2019 interests.  Diamond said the new language adds clarity to the original agreement and places significant restraints on Musk\u2019s use of Twitter.  \u201cAny attempt by Musk to circumvent the process will be much more easily policed,\u201d he said.  Musk has been an outspoken critic of the SEC throughout his legal dispute with the SEC, which he once dubbed the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission.\u201d  In the early morning of Feb. 26, after the regulator filed its contempt motion, Musk tweeted: \u201cSomething is broken with SEC oversight.\u201d  Musk has been CEO of Tesla since 2008 and has more than 25 million followers on Twitter.","1233":"BEIJING, May 27 (Reuters) - U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc said on Wednesday it will cut prices in North America, as the firm ramps up car production in its Fremont, California, factory after the easing of coronavirus lockdowns.

The report released on Monday showed registrations in California, a bellwether for the electric-car maker and its largest U.S. market, recovered from a second-quarter low of roughly 9,800 vehicles to around 16,200 vehicles in the three months ended September. But third-quarter numbers lagged some 13% behind last year\u2019s due to a large drop in Model 3 registrations.  California registration for Tesla\u2019s Model 3 mass-market sedan, which in the past accounted for more than half of total registrations, fell 60% on a yearly basis to 6,500.  At nearly 7,300, registrations in the state for Tesla\u2019s Model Y compact crossover utility vehicle surpassed those for the Model 3.  Earlier this month, Tesla said it delivered 139,300 vehicles in the third quarter, an all-time record, yet shares fell as some analysts doubted if the world\u2019s most valuable carmaker could hit its ambitious year-end target of half a million deliveries.  Total third-quarter vehicle registrations in the 23 states where data was collected and which Cross-Sell said account for 65% of the U.S. market, remained roughly equal to last year at around 32,800 vehicles.  Registration figures might not accurately reflect the number of vehicle deliveries during the quarter as registrations in the United States typically take about 30 days from the time of sale.  Tesla, whose shares have surged more than five-fold this year, is expected to report third-quarter results after market close on Wednesday.","1235":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tesla Inc shares fell sharply again on Wednesday, reeling from a credit downgrade of the electric car maker by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, federal probes of a fatal crash and concerns about Model 3 production.  Shares tumbled 9 percent before ending down 7.7 percent at $257.78. On Tuesday, Tesla tumbled 8.2 percent to its lowest close in almost a year after the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) opened a field investigation into a fatal crash and vehicle fire in California on March 23.  On Wednesday, a second federal regulator, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA), said it was sending a team to California to investigate the crash.  Late on Tuesday, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded Tesla\u2019s credit rating to B3 from B2, citing \u201cthe significant shortfall in the production rate of the company\u2019s Model 3 electric vehicle.\u201d It also noted \u201cliquidity pressures due to its large negative free cash flow and the pending maturities of convertible bonds.\u201d  Tesla has $230 million in convertible bonds maturing in November 2018 and $920 million in March 2019.  Moody\u2019s said its negative outlook \u201creflects the likelihood that Tesla will have to undertake a large, near-term capital raise in order to refund maturing obligations and avoid a liquidity shortfall.\u201d  It said Tesla\u2019s weekly production target is now 2,500 Model 3 vehicles by the end of March, down sharply from its year-earlier target of 5,000 per week by the end of 2017. Tesla\u2019s weekly target for the end of June is 5,000.  Tesla declined to comment on the downgrade. The company plans to provide an update on Model 3 production next week.  Tesla shares have experienced big swings in the past, as worries about losses have vied with enthusiasm for Chief Executive Elon Musk\u2019s ambitious plans.  The sell-off has left Tesla\u2019s stock market value at $44 billion, below General Motors Co\u2019s $49 billion. Palo Alto, California-based Tesla has at times had a larger market value than GM, the largest U.S. automaker by vehicle sales.  Since the end of February, the median analyst price target for Tesla has dipped by $10 to $356, about 37 percent higher than Wednesday\u2019s price, according to Thomson Reuters data. Nomura Securities analyst Romit Shah has the highest Tesla price target, $500, or nearly double the current price. All the targets were set before the March 23 crash.  In last week\u2019s accident in which the Tesla struck a highway median, it was unclear if the vehicle\u2019s automated control system called Autopilot was driving, the NTSB and police said.  The 38-year-old driver of the Tesla died at a nearby hospital shortly after the crash.  Late Tuesday, Tesla said in a blog post it does \u201cnot yet know what happened in the moments leading up to the crash,\u201d but added that data shows Tesla owners have driven the same stretch of highway with Autopilot engaged \u201croughly 85,000 times ... and there has never been an accident that we know of.\u201d The statement did not say if the crashed vehicle was in Autopilot mode.","1236":"March 8 (Reuters) - Institutional Shareholder Services:  * SAYS VOTE \u201cAGAINST\u201d TESLA\u2019S PROPOSAL TO APPROVE STOCK OPTION GRANT TO ELON MUSK IS WARRANTED Further company coverage:","1237":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed lower for a third straight session on Tuesday as heavyweight technology names extended their sell-off to send the Nasdaq into correction territory, while Tesla suffered its biggest daily percentage drop after the stock was passed over for inclusion in the S&P 500.

Tuesday\u2019s losses put the index down 10% from its closing record, confirming a correction began on Sept. 2.  At session lows on Tuesday, Facebook, Amazon.com, Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet and Netflix had collectively lost more than $1 trillion in market capitalization since Sept. 2.  Tesla plunged 21.06% to suffer its biggest daily percentage drop as the electric-car maker was excluded from a group of companies being added to the S&P 500.

Lithium is a key ingredient in rechargeable batteries that power electric cars. Forecasts of soaring demand for vehicles like Tesla Inc\u2019s Model X and General Motors Co\u2019s Chevy Bolt, have lifted lithium carbonate prices more than two times above early 2015 levels.  Lithium miners in Australia and Canada have seen their shares climb, buttressed by demand for electric vehicles, in part due to stricter car emissions standards around the world.  \u201cThis is one sector of our market that we are forecasting will continue to grow substantially,\u201d said James McGlew, executive director for corporate stockbroking at Perth-based Argonaut.  Kidman\u2019s shares rose 2.8 percent on Thursday, compared with a 0.2 percent slip in the broader Australian market. The stock is around 26 times its level in early 2016.  Tesla, led by Silicon Valley billionaire Elon Musk, has upended the market for electric vehicles.

The report bit.ly\/2R5Ii1G, citing sources, said while the automaker is expected to deliver some vehicles on the last day of the year, it is not possible for Tesla to go through the whole inventory.

The company had earlier said it was \u201cdoing everything\u201d to ensure those who ordered a vehicle as late as Dec. 20 could take deliveries by Dec. 31 and Musk has promised to reimburse customers if delivery delays cause them to miss out on a significant tax credit.  Earlier this year, Tesla said orders placed by Oct. 15 would be eligible for the full tax credit of $7,500 and that customers would receive their cars by the end of the year.","1240":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O reported a net profit, positive cash flow and wider-than-expected margins for the latest quarter on Wednesday, delivering on Chief Executive Elon Musk's promise to turn the electric carmaker profitable as higher production volumes of its new Model 3 began to pay off.  Tesla reiterated that it expected to repeat its net profit in the current quarter, helping drive the company\u2019s shares up 14 percent in after hours trading.  The controversial Musk, who has often set goals and deadlines that Tesla has failed to reach, surprised investors by delivering on his pledge to make Tesla profitable for only the third quarter in its 15-year existence, providing a positive end to a difficult quarter for the CEO whose leadership was openly questioned only weeks ago.  \u201cWe can actually be cash flow positive and profitable in all quarters going forward,\u201d Musk said, qualifying that he excluded those in which a big debt payment comes due, such as the first quarter of 2019.  Musk reiterated that Tesla currently does not plan to raise equity or debt.  Tesla said it would begin taking orders in Europe and China for the Model 3 before the end of 2018. Deliveries would begin to Europe in late February or March, and those to China in the second quarter, if not before, Musk said.  Musk said he planned to begin local production in China next year in a \u2018capital efficient manner,\u2019 suggesting the company might use a similar tent structure for car assembly that has already been used at its Fremont, California, plant. He gave no further details on plans in China.  Meanwhile, seeking to quell speculation that a large number of prospective buyers had canceled their reservations due to delays receiving their cars, Tesla said only 20 percent of North American reservation-holders had canceled their bookings.  Free cash flow at $881 million was positive for only the third time in Tesla\u2019s history and was helped by a surge of new production of the Model 3, lower capital expenditures, and more efficient use of working capital.

But if you got a profitable company it\u2019s whole lot easier to raise money.\u201d  (Graphic: Tesla\u2019s balance sheet and strategy - tmsnrt.rs\/2PPLXM5)  SURGING PAST ESTIMATES  The results were a boost for the embattled company after a quarter in which U.S. security regulators accused Musk of fraud for tweeting that he had secured funding for a deal to take the company private which never materialized.  A settlement between Musk, Tesla and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission allowed Musk to remain as CEO, but required a new independent chairman to oversee an array of capital- intensive new projects in 2019, from a factory in China to development of Tesla\u2019s new Model Y SUV.  Musk had vowed since May that Tesla would be profitable in both the third and fourth quarters, and has repeated that the company would not need new capital from financial backers.  Tesla said earlier this month it built 53,239 Model 3 sedans in the quarter, in line with its target of 50,000 to 55,000 vehicles, and delivered 56,065 of the cars to customers.  Musk has been under intense pressure to prove he can deliver consistent production numbers for the Model 3, seen as crucial to Tesla\u2019s profitability and its ability to be a high-volume car producer.  More sales of the higher-priced versions of the Model 3 currently on offer helped margins which rose to over 20 percent in the quarter, Tesla said, above its projection of 15 percent margins. Lower labor hours per vehicle helped, as did lower material costs.  Total revenue more than doubled to $6.82 billion, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $6.33 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  Tesla ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in cash after spending $510.3 million in quarterly capital expenses. It said cash would remain at least unchanged in the fourth quarter, despite a repayment of $230 million in convertible notes coming due.  Tesla reported a profit of $311.5 million, or $1.75 per share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $619.4 million, or $3.70 per share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, earnings were $2.90 per share, versus an average analyst estimate of a loss of 19 cents per share. A Refinitiv SmartEstimate, which gives more weight to analysts with strong track records, estimated Tesla would earn 3 cents per share.  Tesla faces pressing cash needs at its Fremont, California factory, where the company has had a longstanding goal of eventually increasing production to 10,000 Model 3s per week. Musk said a goal of 7,000 was more realistic and would require significantly less capital spending.  Three new vehicles are in development at Tesla: the Model Y, a new $200,000 Roadster and an electric heavy-duty truck that Musk unveiled last November.  Its sprawling Gigafactory battery factory outside Reno, Nevada is only partially complete, and plans for assembly plants in Europe and China are both big-ticket items on the horizon.","1241":"FILE PHOTO: A Tesla Model X is shown at a Tesla service center in Costa Mesa, California, U.S., October 20, 2020.

The other recall covers 401 2020 model year Tesla Model Y vehicles with bolts connecting the front upper control arm and steering knuckle that may not have been properly tightened. Due to the inadequate tightening, NHTSA said the upper control arm could detach from the steering knuckle.  Tesla said it recently learned of three vehicle repairs where the upper control arm had separated.  It said vehicles would be inspected for proper torque and if necessary, would be adjusted.

Fidelity funds that are top Tesla holders including Blue Chip Growth Fund, Growth Company Fund and Contrafund all voted as Tesla recommended at two shareholder meetings held in March and June, the filings showed.

A Fidelity spokeswoman said the Boston firm would not comment on what the votes might suggest about the firm\u2019s views on the go-private deal that Musk is trying to arrange. How much backing funds give Musk will determine how much money he will need to raise in his unprecedented bid to take the company private.

A July 24 U.S. securities filing by Scotland\u2019s Baillie Gifford, Tesla\u2019s largest owner after Musk himself, also showed it backing Tesla across the board at both meetings. A Baillie Gifford representative declined to comment.  The special meeting in March was held to approve a new CEO compensation package potentially worth $2.6 billion for Musk. A filing showed the plan won support from about 81 percent of votes cast, or about 73 percent of votes cast excluding shares held by Musk or his brother, Kimbal Musk.  Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services had recommended voting against the award as too rich. ISS had also recommended votes against two of three Tesla directors who stood for election at its regular meeting in June, citing concerns about their independence and seats on other boards.  ISS also recommended investors back shareholder proposals including one that would require an independent chairman. The directors each won at least 89 percent support, a filing showed, and the proposal for an independent chair was backed by only about 16 percent of votes present, a filing showed.","1246":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window.)  * Upbeat China data signals resilience in global economy  * Tesla hits record high as China-made Model 3 deliveries to begin  * Softness in Chinese demand poses growth risk - analysts Indexes mixed: Dow up 0.12%, S&P flat, Nasdaq down 0.09% (Updates to open)  Dec 27 (Reuters) - Wall Street hovered at record highs on Friday, as investors paused after a year-end rally that has been fueled by optimism over a U.S.-China trade truce and an improving global economy.  All three major U.S. stock indexes opened at record highs as traders cheered upbeat economic data from China, but quickly pared gains in the absence of any new information on an initial Sino-U.S. trade agreement.  The world\u2019s top two economies announced their Phase 1 deal earlier this month, but have since disclosed few concrete details. Beijing said this week it was in close contact with Washington on the pact.  \u201cThese moves are expected in the absence of anything earth-shaking happening,\u201d said Katrina Lamb, head of investment strategy and research at MV Financial, in Bethesda, Maryland.  \u201cWe\u2019ve had such a long run so far that it now feels a bit overstretched.\u201d  Robust U.S. economic data, relatively loose monetary policy and hopes of an imminent trade truce between Beijing and Washington have sent the S&P 500 index to several record highs this month.  The benchmark index is about half a percentage point shy of logging its best year since 1997, while the Nasdaq has now posted 11 straight opening records, crossing the 9,000 mark on Thursday.  Signaling resilience in the global economy, data on Friday showed China\u2019s industrial profits grew at the fastest pace in eight months in November.  Still, some analysts have cautioned that weakness in Chinese demand remains a risk for company earnings next year.  At 10:33 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 34.29 points, or 0.12%, at 28,655.68, while the S&P 500 was flat at 3,240.11. The Nasdaq Composite was down 8.14 points, or 0.09%, at 9,014.25.  Shares of Tesla Inc touched another record high after the electric-car maker said it would begin delivering its China-made Model 3 vehicles on Dec. 30.  Netflix Inc and Alphabet Inc were among the biggest drags on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. The so-called FAANG group of stocks have logged a good run over the past decade, with shares of Netflix up 4,100% in the period.  Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.13-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.82-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.  The S&P index recorded 51 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 63 new highs and 14 new lows.","1247":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O has overtaken Germany's Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE as the world's second most valuable carmaker behind Japan's Toyota 7203.T, as the meteoric rise in the U.S. electric vehicle maker's shares reshuffles the global market.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Tesla\u2019s stock has more than doubled in value in the last three months, with its market capitalization piercing $100 billion on Wednesday, a first for a listed U.S. automaker.  During the rally, its value has leapfrogged more established global rivals: Honda 7267.T, BMW BMWG.DE, General Motors GM.N and Daimler DAIGn.DE. On Wednesday, it eclipsed VW's $99.4 billion value.  Toyota still holds pole position with a market cap of $233 billion.  The recent gains have been fueled by a surprise third-quarter profit, progress at a new factory in China and better-than-expected car deliveries in the fourth quarter.  Many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth.  But the gains highlight growing confidence among investors about the future of electric vehicles and Tesla\u2019s shift from a niche car maker into a global leader in cleaner cars.  A glance at its results shows it has a long way to go before it can eclipse larger rivals.  Based on 12-month forward sales estimates, it doesn\u2019t even appear in the top 20 in the world.

It took eight months for IT specialists and engineers at Igor Krezic\u2019s Stark Solutions company to disassemble a rugged Ford Raptor F-150 into its smallest parts and then transform it into petrol-powered vehicle that resembles a Cybertruck.

Robust corporate earnings, monetary and fiscal support from policymakers and prospects that pandemic vaccines could hasten a return to normal in the United States and other countries have all bolstered risk sentiment in recent days.

Whether billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s flagship company can start mass production quickly enough to hit stated targets is the question investors will want an answer to when Tesla announces third-quarter results on Wednesday.  The U.S. electric vehicles maker is under pressure to ramp up output globally, and the Shanghai plant\u2019s production schedule is crucial if it wants to reach its ambitious target of an annualised production rate of 500,000 vehicles by the end of the year.  Tesla last week obtained the certificate it needs to start manufacturing cars in the country. But analysts contend that uncertainties around labour and suppliers make it a challenge to start mass production.  \u201cThere is a lot in the equation that is not in their control,\u201d said Tu Le, analyst at China-based research firm Sino Auto Insights.  \u201cThere are some things that just need time in order to complete, like qualifying new manufacturing processes, a new battery supplier, getting the tooling shipped and set up, as well as setting up all the suppliers. Any parts that have to be imported need to go through customs, which also could mean delays,\u201d he said.  Tesla is also in the process of obtaining a key certification needed to sell China-made cars in the country, it told local media, though it is unclear when the government will grant it sales clearance.  Tesla did not reply to an email seeking comment.  It said in April it aims to produce at least 1,000 Model 3 cars a week at the new factory by the end of this year.  Analysts, though, are doubtful that Tesla will hit this target, given its patchy production record.  Delays and quality issues have marred the launches of Tesla's Model S and Model X vehicles in the past, and Tesla struggled to start here making the Model 3 at its California factory in 2017.  The company took six months longer than originally forecast to hit a target of 5,000 Model 3 cars per week, achieving that pace about a year after launching production.  Still, Tesla is taking steps to ensure a smooth launch of production, including trying to diversify its battery supplier base, sources have said.  It recently bought Maxwell Technologies, whose technology could help the car maker produce batteries that last longer.  At hiring events in Shanghai in August and September, attended by Reuters journalists, Tesla interviewed hundreds of candidates from mainstream car makers in China.  It also advertised on social media for battery-related production and software system engineers in Shanghai, and delivery managers in big Chinese cities.  FURTHER LOSSES?  China, for its part, is helping speed up things at the Shanghai factory - the country\u2019s first fully foreign-owned car plant, a reflection of Beijing\u2019s broader shift to open up its auto market.  State-owned construction companies have arranged extra workforce and banks are offering cheap loans, while the government said it will exempt Tesla cars from its purchase tax, a concession made amidst trade tensions with the United States.  The Model 3 has fared well in China, the world\u2019s biggest car market.  Tesla sales in China likely surged more than three fold to 10,542 cars in the quarter ended Sept. 30, according to research firm LMC Automotive.  The company expects to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars this year globally.  Analysts expect Tesla\u2019s third-quarter revenue to decline 7% from the year-ago quarter, according to Refinitiv data.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Tesla declined to comment on whether Evan Horetsky, head of engineering, procurement and construction at the German plant, was still with the U.S. company. Horetsky could not be reached for comment.  According to Horetsky\u2019s Linkedin profile, he directed teams leading project design, construction and technical programme management across Tesla\u2019s global factories and energy products.  German broadcaster RBB was first to report the departure. RBB said there would be no delays in the factory\u2019s planning application process as a result of Horetsky leaving.  The Berlin plant will be the fourth Tesla Gigafactory - producing cars and batteries - and the first in Europe.  The carmaker announced plans last November to build the Gigafactory in Gruenheide, outside Berlin with plans to have the factory up and running by July 1, 2021 to start building its electric crossover, the Model Y.  However, the company has been engaged in a lengthy environmental audit, a time-consuming process that is likely to mean construction will take much longer than its Shanghai Gigafactory, which went from greenfield site to building cars in just 11 months.  Horetsky hinted at pressures in a tweet dated Oct. 11.  \u201cCredit belongs to the man in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming,\u201d he said in the Tweet.  \u201c...if he fails, at least (he) fails while daring greatly,\u201d the tweet also said, attributing the quote to Theodore Roosevelt.  At the beginning of October, Tesla set aside three days of hearings to sound out locals and potential critics of the factory.  The consultation process took eight days just to lodge 414 complaints and observations, which will be reviewed by local planning authorities.  Locals were concerned that the Gigafactory, especially once it started building battery cells, would be a drain on local water resources and wanted assurances from Tesla that consumption would be limited.  Tesla, for its part has agreed to cut water consumption to 1.4 million cubic meters, down from 3.3 million cubic meters.  Berlin\u2019s Tagesspiegel newspaper said that on Oct. 16, Tesla was forced to interrupt construction because of unpaid water bills. After receiving a reminder to pay, Tesla gave assurances the bills would be paid, but an IT error led to the payment not going through, Tagesspiegel said. Tesla could not be reached for comment on the issue.  Authorities in Gruenheide and Brandenburg have so far only granted conditional approval for construction. Formal planning permission has not yet been granted.","1268":"Oct 12 (Reuters) - Electric carmaker Tesla Inc said bit.ly\/2NCbs1r all orders for its vehicles placed by Oct. 15 are eligible for full federal tax credit of $7,500 and such customers will get their cars delivered by the end of the year.  Under a major tax overhaul passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress late last year, financial incentives in the way of tax credits that lower the cost of electric vehicles are available for the first 200,000 such vehicles sold by an automaker. The tax credit is then reduced by 50 percent every six months until it phases out.  In July, Tesla said it delivered 200,000 electric cars to buyers in the United States, meaning tax credits will now begin to be lowered while rivals such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW AG and Audi AG will bring electric models to the market with a full tax credit in place.  Buyers of electric cars get full tax credit for the quarter in which the company hits the 200,000 delivery mark and the next.  The declining tax credit is seen as putting Tesla at a disadvantage over newer entrants to the market, whose first 200,000 models will qualify for a full tax credit.  It also adds to what\u2019s been a few bad months as Tesla faced delivery delays due to manufacturing bottlenecks and deferred the much-needed revenue when it continues to spend heavily on Model 3 production fixes as well as projects in the pipeline.  Electrek, which earlier reported on the deadline on new orders, decribed the company's latest move as an attempt to boost sales. bit.ly\/2ONOeuf  However, the incentives could go if a new bill, introduced by a Republican senator to end the federal tax credit for electric cars altogether, is passed, Electrek reported.

NEW YORK, Oct. 1 (Reuters) - Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk did not admit liability in this weekend\u2019s $20 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. But lawyers for shareholders suing Tesla in for securities fraud said the SEC\u2019s case against Musk and his company will help the private litigation in at least two ways.  The most important boost comes from the SEC\u2019s Sept. 27 complaint, which contains detailed allegations about the agency\u2019s investigation of Musk\u2019s Aug. 7 claim to have secured financing for a deal to take Tesla private at $420 per share.  The SEC complaint detailed Musk\u2019s own account of a crucial meeting with a sovereign wealth fund that was allegedly the basis of his tweet floating the go-private deal. The SEC also outlined Musk\u2019s communications with Tesla board members about the meeting and recounted some of the reaction within the company to Musk\u2019s tweet. According to the SEC, that evidence showed Musk\u2019s tweets about the go-private deal \u201cwere premised on a long series of baseless assumptions and were contrary to facts that Musk knew.\u201d  Shareholders\u2019 lawyers say investors can incorporate the SEC\u2019s factual allegations in the private litigation. Plaintiffs in securities class actions are not permitted to obtain discovery from defendants until their cases have survived initial defense dismissal motions. The SEC, however, was able to get crucial evidence, including testimony from Musk. Because the agency made that evidence public in its complaint, class action lawyers can now make use of it.  That evidence increases the likelihood that the private class action will survive any attempt by Tesla to end the litigation quickly, according to shareholders\u2019 lawyers Reed Kathrein of Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, Francis McConville of Labaton Sucharow and Travis Lenkner of Keller Lenkner. Kathrein, McConville and Lenkner all represent shareholders who have sued Tesla for securities fraud in San Francisco federal court.  \u201cWe can plead the facts in the SEC complaint that we didn\u2019t have,\u201d Kathrein said. \u201cThat can get us past Tesla\u2019s motion to dismiss.\u201d  McConville said there have been previous cases in which judges have allowed shareholders\u2019 lawyers in private cases to incorporate facts from regulators\u2019 complaints. He cited, for example, a class action in Manhattan federal court alleging that Barclays secretly favored high frequency traders. The bank argued that shareholders could not rely on allegations developed by the New York attorney general, but U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin rejected that argument in a 2015 opinion (105 F.Supp.3d 330).  HEDGE FUNDS TAKE THE REINS?  Tesla is represented in the private securities litigation by Fenwick & West. I emailed Fenwick lawyers Dean Kristy and Jennifer Bretan to ask about shareholders\u2019 lawyers\u2019 take on the consequences of the SEC case but didn\u2019t hear back. The company and Musk are permitted, under the SEC settlement, to deny liability in the private shareholder litigation. Tesla will almost certainly argue that investors cannot prove Musk intended to deceive them in his Aug. 7 tweets and that he had a reasonable basis to believe he was being truthful.  The second potentially significant consequence of the SEC\u2019s case, according to shareholders\u2019 lawyers, is that the settlement could nudge hedge funds off the sidelines and into leadership of the investor class action.  Several investors have already filed prospective class actions against Tesla and its board members. Those cases are being overseen by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of San Francisco. Under the statutory rules for securities class actions, investors who want to be named to lead the consolidated case must file notice by Oct. 9.  So far, mostly small Tesla investors have surfaced. Only one well-known investor, activist shortseller Andrew Left of Citron Research, has filed a suit and staked a claim to lead the case. That\u2019s not a big surprise. Hedge funds like those that held big short positions in Tesla stock are historically reluctant to initiate shareholder class actions.  But the SEC settlement could change the calculation for institutional Tesla investors, according to shareholders\u2019 lawyers. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to be an instigator,\u201d said Lenkner. \u201cThere\u2019s a different public profile if you\u2019re acting after a government regulator has already said there\u2019s misconduct and reached a settlement.\u201d  Hedge funds may even have a fiduciary responsibility to step up to lead the investor class action, Lenkner said. Assuming the case survives Tesla\u2019s dismissal motions, damages calculations will be shaped, according to Lenkner and Kathrein, by how the lead investor and its lawyers define shareholder losses and frame the time period of the alleged fraud.  \u201cThe ability to control the case from the beginning is important,\u201d Lenkner said. \u201cWhen you have a government settlement and these alleged facts, that starts to move the needle toward \u2018This is something you must do\u2019 rather than \u2018This is something you should do.\u2019\u201d  Kathrein agreed: \u201cNow you don\u2019t look like an angry investor,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at, what should you do to protect your client base.\u201d  All three plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers said they are talking to investors with large Tesla stakes about the prospect of stepping up to lead the case. (Shareholders do not have to file their own lawsuits at this point but can simply file a motion to serve as the lead investor in the cases already before Judge Chen.) They\u2019re anticipating a lot of action in the Tesla docket before that Oct. 9 deadline.  \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 10 years,\u201d said McConville. \u201cThis is by far the most newsworthy, buzzworthy case we\u2019ve been involved with.\u201d (Reporting by Alison Frankel.

Late on Tuesday, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded Tesla\u2019s credit rating to B3 from B2.

Tesla declined to comment on the downgrade. The company plans to provide an update on Model 3 production next week.  In last week\u2019s accident, it was unclear if Tesla\u2019s automated control system was driving the car. The accident involved two other cars, the NTSB and police said.  Tesla vehicles have a system called Autopilot that handles some driving tasks. The 38-year-old driver of the Tesla died at a nearby hospital shortly after the crash.  Late Tuesday, Tesla said in a blog post it does \u201cnot yet know what happened in the moments leading up to the crash,\u201d but added that data shows Tesla owners have driven the same stretch of highway with Autopilot engaged \u201croughly 85,000 times... and there has never been an accident that we know of.\u201d The company statement did not say if the crashed vehicle had been in Autopilot mode.

FILE PHOTO: A 2018 Tesla Model 3 electric vehicle is shown in this photo illustration taken in Cardiff, California, U.S., June 1, 2018. Picture taken June 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  According to documents filed by the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office (USTR) and reviewed by Reuters, exclusion requests from Tesla and others for Chinese-made products from aircraft parts to biotechnology instruments were denied because they were deemed \u201cstrategically important\u201d to the \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d program.  Tesla declined to comment.  The company has separate pending tariff exclusion requests for duties on the Chinese-made Model 3 Center Screen and for the Model 3 Car Computer before USTR.  Tesla said in a securities filing on Monday: \u201cOur costs for producing our vehicles in the U.S. have also been affected by import duties on certain components sourced from China.\u201d  The denials illustrate a systematic approach by the Trump administration to thwart China\u2019s efforts to develop high-technology industries that Washington alleges benefited from theft and forced transfer of U.S. intellectual property.  Made in China 2025, a program aimed at growing China\u2019s prowess in 10 strategic industries dominated by the United States, is at the heart of trade negotiations and U.S. demands for sweeping changes to China\u2019s policies.  Those industries include new energy and autonomous vehicles, aerospace, semiconductors, biopharmaceuticals, robotics and artificial intelligence.  ECONOMIC HARM  Tesla first made its request to exclude its 3.0 Autopilot electronic control unit in July 2018, which it called the \u201cbrain of the vehicle\u201d when the Palo Alto, California-based automaker warned that \u201cincreased tariffs on this particular part cause economic harm to Tesla, through the increase of costs and impact to profitability.\u201d  In a March 15 letter, USTR general counsel Stephen Vaughn said the agency was denying Tesla\u2019s request because it \u201cconcerns a product strategically important or related to \u2018Made in China 2025 or other Chinese industrial programs.\u201d USTR issued a separate letter also denying a request for the earlier 2.5 version of the Autopilot ECU.  It was not clear when the letter was posted on a U.S. government website. Other exclusion denials were posted at the same time, including for industrial robots imported by Kawasaki Robotics USA and composite panels made by Hexcel Corp in China for use in various Boeing Co aircraft.  Some less high-tech products cited in the 2025 denials included a wiring harness for a rear door imported by Lear Corp\u2019s Chinese joint venture, Kyungshin-Lear Sales and Engineering LLC.  \u201cThe material composition of the product consists of insulated wire, connectors, terminals, tape, and conduit,\u201d Kyungshin-Lear said in its request.  USTR has received China tariff exclusion requests for nearly 13,000 products and denied 5,311. Of the denials, 1,166, or more than a fifth, contained the same language as the Tesla request, citing links to Made in China 2025.  NO U.S. SOURCES  Tesla told USTR it was unable to find a manufacturer in the United States, adding that \u201cchoosing any other supplier would have delayed the (Model 3) program by 18 months with clean room setup, line validation, and staff training.\u201d  Tesla says it reflashes the Autopilot ECU with the latest Firmware created in California when it is shipped from China by supplier Quanta Shanghai.  \u201cFor a product as safety critical to consumers, and critical to the essence of Tesla, we turned to industry experts who could achieve this quality and complexity in addition to the deadlines, which was not possible outside of China,\u201d Tesla wrote. \u201cWhen it comes to identifying a supplier, we cannot risk our customers\u2019 lives due to a defect from a supplier.\u201d  The Autopilot ECU, also used in the Model S and X, includes two printed circuit board assemblies, which Tesla calls \u201cthe brain responsible for Tesla\u2019s Autopilot functionality\u201d and the main safety system for the vehicle.  Tesla has a separate pending tariff exclusion request filed in December for duties on the Chinese-made Model 3 Center Screen.  Other exclusion requests also cited the lack of U.S. sources. Kawasaki said there are no industrial robots manufactured in the United States, and it only produces robots in China and Japan.  In a previously unreported request, Tesla also asked USTR to waive tariffs on the 17-inch (43-cm) cockpit touchscreen control panel that displays navigation, media, audio, climate control, energy display, and all in-cabin controls.  Other automakers have sought similar exemptions but have not yet received answers.  General Motors Co in late July sought an exemption to a 25-percent U.S. tariff on its Chinese-made Buick Envision sport utility vehicle. The Envision accounted for nearly 15 percent of U.S. Buick sales last year.  GM has also sought exclusions for dozen of parts, including push button ignition switches and transmission bearings.  Nissan Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV have also filed exclusion requests for parts, while Uber Technologies Inc asked for an exclusion for electric bikes rented through the Uber app.  Even if the United States and China reach a trade deal in the coming weeks to resolve their disputes, companies may not see tariff relief for months or possibly years. People familiar with the talks say that some tariffs, especially those aimed at the Made in China 2025 industries, could remain in place as part of an enforcement mechanism.  Vice President Mike Pence said on Friday that the manner in which tariffs were removed would be part of that mechanism, aimed at ensuring China lives up to its obligations in any agreement.","1272":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar was flat to slightly lower on Monday in choppy trading, after falling sharply on disappointing U.S. jobs data last week, even as investors also focused on rallying cryptocurrencies led by bitcoin after Tesla announced a $1.5 billion investment in the digital asset.

As part of a multi-part, multibillion-dollar deal, GM received an 11% stake in Nikola, valued at about $2 billion. In return for the Nikola shares, GM will supply Nikola with batteries, a chassis architecture, fuel cell systems and a factory to build the startup\u2019s proposed Nikola Badger pickup. GM will also supply fuel cell technology for Nikola\u2019s planned Class 7 and 8 commercial tractor-trailers.  Shares of Nikola soared more than 48% to $52.94 after GM\u2019s investment, giving GM a paper gain of more than $500 million on its investment. GM said it expects to realize a total of $4 billion in value from the deal, including $700 million for building the Badger at one of its factories, and the value of regulatory credits for a zero emission vehicle.  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra also said the Detroit company may supply other companies with its Ultium electric battery and hydrogen fuel cell technologies.  \u201cWe are certainly open to consider additional deals as it relates to both Ultium and the fuel cell Hydrotec technology,\u201d she told reporters on a conference call.  The alliance with Nikola is the second major deal in a week for GM and highlights the pressures faced by the auto industry to share costs to meet demands for cleaner vehicles. Last week GM announced a North American alliance with Japan's Honda Motor Co 7267.T.  The agreements also signal the urgency of Barra\u2019s efforts to convince investors that GM can slash costs in its traditional, internal combustion business and develop a profitable, viable electric vehicle business.

GM will build the electric and fuel cell versions of the Nikola Badger truck and the companies expect production by the end of 2022.  Nikola will buy GM\u2019s fuel cell systems for its Class 7 and Class 8 semi trucks. That deal runs for four years after start of production of those vehicles at a Nikola plant outside Phoenix and is exclusive except for the European market.  The companies did not say where the Nikola pickup would be built by GM. Most of GM\u2019s EVs will be built at its Detroit-Hamtramck plant.  Nikola said it expects to save $4 billion in battery and powertrain costs over 10 years and over $1 billion in engineering and validation costs.  Nikola CEO Trevor Milton said Tuesday that avoiding the cost of building a pickup truck assembly plant and developing a truck chassis was \u201ca big deal for us.\u201d Nikola\u2019s Badger will now share major components under the skin - and a supply chain - with the GMC Hummer.  \u201cWe are going to swap out our platform for theirs,\u201d Milton said.  GM under the deal also will receive EV credits, an important factor as most of GM\u2019s vehicles are still gasoline-powered.  Barra said the companies were introduced to each other by former GM vice chairman Steve Girsky, who took Nikola public through a reverse merger with his special purpose acquisition company earlier this year. Girsky is on the Nikola board.  The Nikola truck will compete with Tesla's Cybertruck, as well as electric pickups planned by startup Rivian, Ford Motor Co F.N and GM itself.  Nikola claims the Badger will have a range of 600 miles, compared with the Cycbertruck\u2019s claimed range of more than 500 miles. The Cybertruck and other electric pickups have not launched yet.  Last year, GM failed to reach a deal with Rivian, which then sold a stake to Ford.  CNH Industrial CNHI.MI has a 7.11% stake in Nikola, through its truck unit IVECO.

Eventually, improved versions of the battery, with greater energy density and storage capacity and even lower cost, will be introduced in additional Tesla vehicles in other markets, including North America, the sources said.  Tesla\u2019s plan to launch the new battery first in China and its broader strategy to reposition the company have not previously been reported. Tesla declined to comment.  Tesla\u2019s new batteries will rely on innovations such as low-cobalt and cobalt-free battery chemistries, and the use of chemical additives, materials and coatings that will reduce internal stress and enable batteries to store more energy for longer periods, sources said.  Tesla also plans to implement new high-speed, heavily automated battery manufacturing processes designed to reduce labor costs and increase production in massive \u201cterafactories\u201d about 30 times the size of the company\u2019s sprawling Nevada \u201cgigafactory\u201d \u2014 a strategy telegraphed in late April to analysts by Musk.  Tesla is working on recycling and recovery of such expensive metals as nickel, cobalt and lithium, through its Redwood Materials affiliate, as well as new \u201csecond life\u201d applications of electric vehicle batteries in grid storage systems, such as the one Tesla built in South Australia in 2017. The automaker also has said it wants to supply electricity to consumers and businesses, but has not provided details.  Reuters reported exclusively in February that Tesla was in advanced talks to use CATL\u2019s lithium iron phosphate batteries, which use no cobalt, the most expensive metal in EV batteries.  CATL also has developed a simpler and less expensive way of packaging battery cells, called cell-to-pack, that eliminates the middle step of bundling cells. Tesla is expected to use the technology to help reduce battery weight and cost.  The sources said CATL also plans to supply Tesla in China next year with an improved long-life nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) battery whose cathode is 50% nickel and only 20% cobalt.  Tesla now jointly produces nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) batteries with Panasonic 6752.T at a \u201cgigafactory\u201d in Nevada, and buys NMC batteries from LG Chem 051910.KS in China. Panasonic declined to comment.  Taken together, the advances in battery technology, the strategy of expanding the ways in which EV batteries can be used and the manufacturing automation on a huge scale all aim at the same target: Reworking the financial math that until now has made buying an electric car more expensive for most consumers than sticking with carbon-emitting internal combustion vehicles.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got to really make sure we get a very steep ramp in battery production and continue to improve the cost per kilowatt-hour of the batteries \u2014 this is very fundamental and extremely difficult,\u201d Musk told investors in January. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to scale battery production to crazy levels that people cannot even fathom today.\u201d  Tesla has reported operating profits for three quarters in a row, driving a near-doubling of its share price this year. Still, Musk\u2019s ambitious expansion plans depend on increasing both profit margins and sales volume.  A number of the technical advances made by Tesla and CATL in battery chemistry and design originated at a small research lab at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The lab has been run since 1996 by Jeff Dahn, a pioneer in the development of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and grid storage.  Dahn and his team began an exclusive five-year research partnership with Tesla in mid-2016, but the relationship dates back at least to 2012.  Among the critical contributions from Dahn\u2019s lab: Chemical additives and nano-engineered materials to make lithium-ion batteries tougher and more resistant to bruising from stress such as rapid charging, thus extending their life.  The cost of CATL\u2019s cobalt-free lithium iron phosphate battery packs has fallen below $80 per kilowatt-hour, with the cost of the battery cells dropping below $60\/kWh, the sources said. CATL\u2019s low-cobalt NMC battery packs are close to $100\/kWh.  Auto industry executives have said $100\/kWh for battery packs is the level at which electric vehicles reach rough parity with internal combustion competitors.  Battery expert Shirley Meng, a professor at the University of California San Diego, said NMC cells could cost as little as $80\/kWh once recycling and recovery of key materials such as cobalt and nickel is factored in. Iron phosphate batteries, which are safer than NMC, could find a second life in stationary grid storage systems, reducing the upfront cost of those batteries for electric vehicle buyers.  In comparison, the new low-cobalt batteries being jointly developed by General Motors Co GM.N and LG Chem are not expected to reach those cost levels until 2025, according to a source familiar with the companies\u2019 work.  GM declined to comment on its cost targets. Earlier this year, it said only that it planned to \u201cdrive battery cell costs below $100\/kWh\u201d without specifying a timetable.","1277":"Oct 17 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk will purchase company stock worth $20 million in the next open trading session, the electric carmaker said in a filing on Wednesday.

A German court has told the U.S. billionaire\u2019s electric vehicle company Tesla to suspend clearing of a forest at the site of the proposed factory after environmentalists said that cutting down more trees could endanger hibernating snakes.  \u201cThe Landesumweltamt (state environmental authority) and Tesla will now be consulted, they need to make submissions by this afternoon and then we assess the situation,\u201d a spokesman for the administrative court in Frankfurt an der Oder in eastern Germany said on Tuesday.  Tesla declined to comment. The Landesumweltamt declined to comment further.  The carmaker announced plans late last year to build its first European factory and design centre in Gruenheide, outside Berlin, with plans to have it up and running by July 1, 2021 to start building its electric crossover, the Model Y sports utility vehicle.  Musk, who has transformed Tesla from start-up to the world\u2019s most valuable automaker in the space of 16 years, is used to moving fast. The company\u2019s Shanghai Gigafactory went from greenfield site to building cars in just 11 months.  The decision to locate the company\u2019s first European factory near Berlin gives the U.S. electric car pioneer the coveted \u201cMade in Germany\u201d label but it also means navigating local planning rules.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Tesla\u2019s permission to start construction hinges on a conditional approval by local authorities, who are obliged to consult environmental groups and the community.  The company has been engaged in an environmental audit, a time-consuming process in a country where attention to detail is prized.  Environmental activists from a local group, NABU, are concerned that the smooth snake, also known as Coronella austriaca, may be hibernating in the ground at the site, and that tree-cutting activity may disturb its winter slumber.  Local authorities are also reviewing claims by NABU that Lacerta agilis, also known as sand lizards, could be put at risk by Tesla\u2019s expansion, NABU said.  At the beginning of October, Tesla set aside three days to sound out locals and potential critics of the factory, but the consultation process lasted eight days and 414 complaints and observations were lodged.  Locals were concerned that the Gigafactory, especially once it started building battery cells, would be a drain on local water resources and wanted assurances from Tesla that consumption would be limited.  In response, Tesla agreed to cut water consumption to 1.4 million cubic meters, down from 3.3 million cubic meters.  Berlin\u2019s Tagesspiegel was first to report that Tesla has been ordered to suspend clearing of the forest.","1281":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc has delivered 200,000 electric cars to buyers in the United States, a spokesperson said on Thursday, meaning tax credits will now begin to be lowered, while rivals such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW AG and Audi AG will bring electric models to the market with a full tax credit in place.  FILE PHOTO: The Tesla logo is seen at the entrance to Tesla Motors' new showroom in Manhattan's Meatpacking District in New York City, U.S., December 14, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Under a major tax overhaul passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress late last year, financial incentives in the way of tax credits that lower the cost of electric vehicles are available for the first 200,000 such vehicles sold by an automaker. The tax credit is then reduced by 50 percent every six months until it phases out.  From Jan. 1 next year, the $7,500 tax credit will drop to $3,750 around mid-year, the Tesla website said here.  General Motors Co will also face the same problem as Tesla in the near future, as it is expected to hit the 200,000 mark with sales of its Chevrolet Bolt EV, the Chevrolet Spark all-electric subcompact car and Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid.  The declining tax credit is seen as putting Tesla and GM at a disadvantage over newer entrants to the market, whose first 200,000 models will qualify for a full tax credit.  GM sold an estimated 184,000 full electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles through June, according to website insideevs.com, which tracks electric vehicle sales.  A spokesman for GM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Earlier this year, amid concerns they could miss the federal tax break, some potential buyers of Tesla\u2019s long-delayed Model 3 sedan began seeking alternatives, including GM\u2019s Bolt, according to postings by would-be Tesla buyers on websites and interviews with GM dealers.  Both GM and Tesla have been lobbying Congress since last year, hoping to win changes to tax law that would allow them to continue to collect the tax credit, but have been unsuccessful to date.  In March, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra called on Congress to expand the consumer tax credit for electric vehicles as the company boosted production of the Bolt in response to strong demand.  Last week, GM said demand for the Bolt in the United States, Canada and South Korea had \u201coutstripped production\u201d and that it would increase output in the fourth quarter by 20 percent.","1282":"FILE PHOTO: A view of Tesla Inc's U.S. vehicle factory in Fremont, California, U.S., March 18, 2020.

Tesla, which now sells its Model 3 electric cars in China and plans to deliver its Model Y sport utility vehicles in 2021, plans to invest 42 million yuan ($6.4 million) in a new factory to make the chargers, also known as charging piles, near its car plant in Shanghai, the document seen by Reuters said.

Tesla has been trying to minimize spending and maximize revenue, cutting jobs and restructuring while trying to fast-track vehicle deliveries of its new Model 3 to customers, to meet a promise Musk first made in May to be cash-flow positive and profitable in the third and fourth quarters.  The results will cap a turbulent quarter in which U.S. security regulators accused Musk of fraud for misleading tweets and forced him to forgo the chairman role in a settlement.  Bears who bet against the company celebrated, until noted short-seller Citron Research on Tuesday reversed course, saying it believed the Model 3 was a \u201cproven hit.\u201d  \u201cWhile the media has been focused on Elon Musk\u2019s eccentric, outlandish and at times offensive behavior, it has failed to notice the legitimate disruption of the auto industry that is currently being dominated by Tesla,\u201d Citron wrote.  The Palo Alto, California-based car maker\u2019s shares, which have fallen 15 percent in the past 12 months, were up 0.5 percent on Wednesday.  Tesla scheduled its earnings release earlier in the calendar than usual, most likely because it is expecting to report a profit, Mainstay Capital Management strategist David Kudla said.  The chief question for investors will be whether Tesla is profitably building the new Model 3, which would mean that its earnings would rise as volume improves. Model 3 margins first turned \u201cslightly positive\u201d in the second quarter, Tesla said, after months of manufacturing problems.  Tesla delivered 55,840 Model 3s in the third quarter, worth more than $3 billion in revenue at $59,000 per car - the average price paid without add-ons. That is a substantial increase from $1 billion in the second quarter.  More sales of the higher-priced versions of the Model 3, which carry fatter margins, will help profitability. The all-wheel drive and performance versions help get Tesla closer to its goal of third-quarter Model 3 margins of 15 percent, with 20 percent margins expected for the fourth.  For a graphic on Tesla's balance sheet and strategy, click tmsnrt.rs\/2PPLXM5  LOWER-PRICED MODEL 3  Musk also could face questions later on Wednesday about whether the company will introduce its long-promised $35,000 Model 3, which Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said was a double-edged sword: if Tesla does not, some customers will be angry, and if it does, margins likely will be further pressured.  Investors are likely to look hard for one-off boosters to the bottom line.  Tesla gets \u201czero emission vehicle\u201d credits for its electric cars and can sell them to other manufacturers that have to meet California regulatory goals. It may have been stockpiling them, since it has posted only a gain of $50 million in such credits this year, versus the $360 million it booked in 2017.  Such credit sales pushed Tesla to a profit in its third-quarter of 2016, one of two times it has been in the black so far.  If Tesla cuts capital expenditures, research and development on upcoming vehicles or new hiring, investors will ask whether that reflects improving efficiency or delay of necessary spending.  Musk also has promised to be cash flow positive, and investors will watch whether its rocky delivery system is improving. Shortening the time cars are in transit so that revenue can hit the books more quickly would shorten its cash conversion cycle, boosting cash flow.  The outspoken CEO also is sure to be pressed on his view, repeated since April, that Tesla has no need to raise new capital. Some analysts have questioned that position, given the funding needs for the many projects on Tesla\u2019s radar, which include a Model Y SUV, a heavy-duty truck and a new factory in China.  The Shanghai Gigafactory, based in eastern China, aims to manufacture Model 3 and Model Y cars, with annual capacity of 250,000 vehicles, according to a filing.  Some analysts have estimated the company will need to raise $2 billion by the end of 2018 to fund operations. Between publicly issued bonds and loans from banks and other entities, Tesla has about $2.2 billion due by November 2019.","1286":"FILE PHOTO: Tesla China-made Model 3 vehicles are seen during a delivery event at its factory in Shanghai, China January 7, 2020.

An automated body welding line for electric cars is seen at Volkswagen's Zwickau assembly plant in Zwickau, Germany, September 13, 2019. REUTERS\/Joe White  Volkswagen is readying two Chinese factories to build electric cars next year. The Chinese plants will have a production capacity of 600,000 vehicles, according to Volkswagen\u2019s plans, which have not been previously reported - revealing VW\u2019s ability to industrialise production faster than other pioneers in the electric vehicle market.  Tesla is still trying to reach its goal of making more than 500,000 cars a year by building a new factory in Shanghai, China, while VW can rely on an established workforce in two of its plants in Anting and Foshun to build zero-emission cars.  The scale and speed of VW\u2019s electrification push marks a shift in favour of established manufacturers that can use existing factories and profit from combustion-engined sport utility vehicles (SUVs) to scale up faster than startups.  \u201cThe truth is barriers to entry in autos remain high,\u201d said Max Warburton, an analyst at Bernstein Research. \u201cMaking cars is hard. The move to electric vehicles will be expensive, but will probably be led by traditional manufacturers.\u201d  VW is leveraging its large infrastructure of suppliers, factories and workers, long a handicap to its profitability, more aggressively than rivals BMW, Renault SA, General Motors Co and Tesla, which were all quicker to sell a custom-designed electric car.  Rather than adjusting production gradually, and using multi-powertrain platforms, Volkswagen is making a massive bet on a dedicated electric vehicle architecture, known as MEB, in the hope of increasing economies of scale sufficiently to push down the price of electric cars to around 20,000 euros ($22,262).  The Wolfsburg, Germany-based carmaker is retooling eight plants across the globe by 2022 to specialise in manufacturing electric cars, and license its electric MEB platform to rivals, senior VW executives told Reuters, putting it on track to become the world\u2019s largest maker of zero-emission vehicles.  Tesla has emerged as a serious competitor with a credible car, its Model 3, Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess told Reuters last week. But startups have a hard time entering mass production without sufficient production facilities, he said.  \u201cThe question is, can you expand your production quickly enough? The capital intensity is increasing,\u201d Diess said.  To fund its own electrification shift, the German carmaker aims to increase sales of VW SUVs, with combustion engines, to 40% of overall sales by 2020 from 23% in 2018.  The powerstation that supplies energy for VW\u2019s flagship e-vehicle factory in Zwickau, Germany, marked by two tall chimneys, was built to power production of the combustion-engined Volkswagen Golf.  Now Zwickau can piggyback off this infrastructure to ramp up production to 330,000 VW ID electric cars by 2021.  Volkswagen Group will increase economies of scale by rolling out electric vehicle platforms to its Audi, Skoda and Seat and Porsche brands.  Volkswagen Group will be in a position to build 22 million electric cars by 2028, of which 11.6 million could come out of Chinese factories, VW said.

Back in 2016, Tesla said it wanted to build more than 500,000 Model 3 cars by 2018, a goal it has failed to meet. This year it expects to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars, a target that includes selling all models.  Tesla\u2019s struggles have dampened optimism about how easy it is to enter the car business, making it harder for China\u2019s NIO, backed by internet company Tencent Holdings Ltd, as well as others like Faraday Future and Byton Ltd, to fund the next stage of growth: capital-intensive volume production and sales.  \u201cSo much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you.\u201d  After starting trial production runs at its factory in Shanghai, Tesla now hopes to reach its 500,000-vehicle target in the 12-month period ending June 30, 2020. Tesla is also looking for a site to start production in Europe.  Volkswagen is converting two German plants, Hanover and Zwickau, to build electric vehicles and will retool other factories including plants in China: Foshan which VW runs together with its joint-venture partner FAW-Volkswagen, and another in Anting, which VW runs together with SAIC.  It will retool plants in Emden and Dresden in Germany, Mlada Boleslav in the Czech Republic, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, in United States, as part of a 30 billion-euro ($33.24 billion)investment push into e-mobility by 2023.  As a result, Volkswagen Group will be the No. 1 electric vehicle producer globally by 2025, while Tesla is likely to remain a niche player, according to UBS autos analyst Patrick Hummel.  TECHNOLOGY INTERLOPERS  The cutthroat rivalry between automakers and software companies started when Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google presented a prototype autonomous vehicle in 2012, leading analysts and industry executives to fear a so-called Nokia moment. This occurs when a new player from the tech sector unveils a superior design, in the way that Apple Inc presented the iPhone in 2007, ending Nokia\u2019s dominance of the mobile handset business.  Today, Tesla\u2019s cars are generally perceived as cutting-edge and potentially more sophisticated than VW\u2019s. Volkswagen\u2019s ID.3, which starts production this year, has an operating range of between 330 and 550 kilometers (205 to 341 miles), below the 560 km long-range Model 3 version offered by Tesla.  That is because Tesla has a sophisticated software algorithm to control how much electricity goes to the electric motor, air conditioning, seat heaters, in-car infotainment, and cooling system.  Volkswagen\u2019s edge is more blunt: price and massive economies of scale.  The ID.3 has a starting price of under 30,000 euros ($33,363) in Germany. By contrast, Tesla\u2019s Model 3 had an average selling price of $50,000 in the second quarter. The long-range version retails for 52,390 euros in Germany.  The VW vehicle\u2019s lower price comes from the carmaker\u2019s ability to place large orders which, by nature of their size, help drive down the price. Volkswagen is investing 50 billion euros ($55.5 billion) to buy battery cells and will also license its MEB electric car platform to rival carmakers to further increase economies of scale.  That is, Volkswagen will make that huge investment if suppliers can keep up.  \u201cThere is a lot of investment,\u201d Stefan Sommer, Volkswagen Group\u2019s board member responsible for procurement, told Reuters last month. \u201cBut even the big companies like Samsung, CATL, LG Chem, the big guys, SK, they hesitate to take so much money and invest because they are not seeing the market on the other side.\u201d  \u201cWe are now seeing the first battery plants, LG in Poland, CATL in Germany, they don\u2019t have the skilled workforce. That will be the bottleneck,\u201d Sommer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a learning curve everybody has to work through. This will cause some lags in supply. We have no other choice.\u201d  VW plans to license its electric MEB vehicle platform to rival Ford Motor Co, which will give VW $10 billion in revenue over the next six years.  Thomas Ulbrich, Volkswagen\u2019s member of the board who oversees production of electric vehicles, told Reuters, \u201cFord and Volkswagen\u2019s agreement will be a blueprint for further licensing deals.\u201d  In the short term, Volkswagen and its Chinese joint venture partners will invest 15 billion euros to produce 15 different electric cars for China alone by 2025.  \u201cThe first MEB-based vehicle is an SUV model,\u201d Volkswagen said about its China push.

Musk also said the company was on track to top its record for quarterly deliveries of 90,700 cars set in the fourth quarter of last year.","1295":"(Reuters) - Orders for Tesla Inc\u2019s electric pickup Cybertruck are inching closer to the record set by the company\u2019s Model 3 sedans in 2016, with company head Elon Musk signaling 250,000 customers have now lined up to buy the new vehicle less than a week after its launch.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The flood of reservations has been encouraged by Tesla\u2019s cut-price $100 deposit to place a booking and a steady drumbeat of promotion from the Silicon Valley billionaire to his millions of social media followers.  Musk tweeted \u201c250k\u201d on Tuesday night in an apparent reference to the number of orders. The company did not immediately confirm that figure on Wednesday.  Ford Motor Co executive Sunny Madra has also pitched in by challenging Musk via his Twitter account to an \u201capples to apples\u201d tug of war between the Cybertruck and a comparable Ford F-150 pickup.  At the Cybertruck launch last week, Musk showed a video of the Tesla vehicle winning a tug of war and dragging a Ford truck uphill. He said he would happily hold another contest next week.  One online bookmaker on Wednesday had Tesla as favorite to win a contest at odds of 5 to 2 on.  Tesla\u2019s shares were up marginally on Wednesday afternoon, but still down around 7% since the vehicle\u2019s launch last Thursday.  \u201cSunny\u2019s tweet was tongue in cheek ... nothing more,\u201d a Ford spokesman said.  \u201cWith America\u2019s best-selling truck for 42 years, we\u2019ve always focused on serving our truck customers regardless of what others say or do. We look forward to our all-new F-150 hybrid coming next year and all-electric F-150 in a few years,\u201d the spokesman said.  Tesla opened bookings immediately after the unveiling and allowed potential buyers the option to reserve three versions of the truck priced at $39,900, $49,900 and $69,900. It plans to start manufacturing the truck around late-2021.  The reservation price compares to $1,000 that the company charged to book a Model 3 in the months after its much-hyped launch three years ago.  \u201cThe $100 Truck reservation is Tesla admitting preorders are meaningless,\u201d Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said.  Tesla claimed it had 455,000 reservations for the Model 3 in 2017 before it started selling and it had sold 275,000 of the cars by the second quarter of this year.  Gordon Johnson, an analyst at GLJ Research, said the Cybertruck would likely have a much lower conversion rate of actual purchases to orders.  Musk\u2019s tweets have hinted that Tesla will employ new techniques to build the Cybertruck, which is made of stainless steel used in rockets.  The Cybertruck\u2019s angular futuristic design has polarized opinion, with some analysts saying it had no chance of drawing in the sort of mass audience that has made pickup trucks the U.S. car industry\u2019s best-selling vehicles.","1296":"FILE PHOTO - Brandenburg\u2019s Prime Minister and top SPD candidate Dietmar Woidke reacts to the final results of regional elections in Saxony and Brandenburg, in Berlin, Germany, September 2, 2019.

Musk said on Monday he had held talks with a Saudi sovereign fund on a buyout that would take Tesla off the Nasdaq exchange - an extraordinary move for what is now the United States\u2019 most valuable automaker, worth more than $60 billion.  The committee, made up of Tesla independent directors Brad Buss, Robyn Denholm and Linda Johnson Rice, will wade into a deal that has puzzled Wall Street since a surprise announcement by Musk on Twitter last week.  Musk then proposed taking the company private at $420 a share - versus the current $354 - and said funding had been \u201csecured\u201d.  He has given more details - including saying he is working with Goldman Sachs and buyout firm Silver Lake - but is yet to convince Wall Street analysts and investors that he can find the billions needed to complete the deal.  Corporate governance and shareholder voting advisor Institutional Shareholder Services has said it does not consider Buss to be an independent director, running counter to Tesla\u2019s view, due to his connections to a solar panel business the company bought two years ago.  Buss was chief financial officer of solar panel installer SolarCity for two years before retiring when Tesla paid $2.6 billion for the sales and installation firm in 2016.  The purchase was Tesla\u2019s last big deal and was criticized by some on Wall Street because the company, founded by two of Musk\u2019s cousins, had seen its business shrink before the takeover.  Denholm, the first woman to join Tesla\u2019s board, is chief operations officer of telecom firm Telstra and the ex-CFO of network gear maker Juniper Networks.  Rice, the first African-American and second woman to join the company\u2019s board, is the chairman of Johnson Publishing Co.  Tesla\u2019s other board members include Musk, his brother Kimbal Musk, Twenty-First Century Fox\u2019s CEO James Murdoch, Antonio Gracias, founder of Valor Equity Partners and Ira Ehrenpreis, founder of venture capital firm DBL Partners.  One more director, Steve Jurvetson, is currently on leave of absence following allegations of sexual harassment.  Tesla\u2019s board disclosed on Aug. 8 that Musk had held talks with the directors in the previous week on taking the company private.  The company said in the statement that the special committee has the authority to take any action on behalf of the board to evaluate and negotiate a potential transaction and alternatives to any transaction proposed by Musk.  Latham and Watkins LLP has been retained by the committee as its legal counsel. Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati will be legal counsel for Tesla itself.

Musk has been pushing to re-open Tesla\u2019s Fremont, California, factory after Alameda County\u2019s health department said the carmaker must not reopen because local lockdown measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus remain in effect.  In a blog post on Saturday, Tesla said the county\u2019s position left it no choice but to take legal action to ensure Tesla and its employees can go back to work.  The company said it had worked out a thorough return-to-work plan that includes online video training for personnel, work zone partition areas, temperature screening, requirements to wear protective equipment and rigorous cleaning and disinfecting protocols.  The company said it had informed health authorities in Alameda County, where the Fremont factory is located, about its restart plans, but claimed the acting official did not return calls or emails.  Alameda County\u2019s Public Health Department, which earlier on Saturday said it had been \u201ccommunicating directly and working closely with the Tesla team,\u201d did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Tesla filed a lawsuit against the county in San Francisco federal court on Saturday, calling the continued restrictions a \u201cpower-grab\u201d by the county since California\u2019s governor had said on Thursday that manufacturers in the state would be allowed to reopen.  The company said Alameda was going against the federal and California constitutions, as well as defying the governor\u2019s order, the lawsuit said.  Alameda County is scheduled to remain shut until the end of May, with only essential businesses allowed to reopen. The county said it does not consider Tesla an essential business. County officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.  The outspoken Musk also took to Twitter on Saturday to complain and threatened to leave the state.  \u201cIf we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen (sp) on how Tesla is treated in the future,\u201d he tweeted, referring to the San Francisco Bay area facility that is Tesla\u2019s only U.S. vehicle factory.  Alameda County said on Saturday that it has been working with Tesla to develop a safety plan that \u201callows for reopening while protecting the health and well-being of the thousands of employees\u201d that work at the factory and that it looks forward to coming to an agreement on a safety plan very soon.  Fremont Mayor Lily Mei expressed concern about the potential economic implications of continuing the shelter-in-place order without provisions for manufacturers such as Tesla to resume. Mei on Saturday urged the county to work with businesses on \u201cacceptable guidelines for re-opening.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk speaks at an opening ceremony for Tesla China-made Model Y program in Shanghai, China January 7, 2020.

Tesla last year built nearly half a million vehicles at the Fremont plant and moving the entire production facility would be a massive undertaking.  Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst, on Saturday estimated it could take the company 12 to 18 months to relocate production.  The threat to relocate the facility comes as Tesla aims to ramp up production at Fremont of its Model Y sport utility vehicle, which it expects to generate record demand and profit margins.  Musk, who sparred with California officials in March over whether Tesla had to halt production at Fremont, had criticized the lockdown and stay-at-home orders, calling them a \u201cserious risk\u201d to U.S. business and \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d  Tesla shares have risen 127% since March 18, their recent closing low, including a 16.8% gain in the last trading week to close at $819.42 on Friday.","1301":"Slideshow ( 4 images )  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities watchdog\u2019s request that a federal judge hold Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk in contempt over the billionaire entrepreneur\u2019s use of Twitter was \u201creasonable,\u201d said a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission official on Monday.  SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson, a Democrat, told reporters at a conference in Washington that the SEC was reasonable in suggesting greater oversight of Musk\u2019s communications, including the threat of new fines if he backslides.  \u201cThe idea (is) that we would have future oversight to prevent future problems from recurring,\u201d Jackson said.  The SEC had asked U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan to hold Musk in contempt over a Feb. 19 tweet in which the agency said he had improperly posted material information about Tesla\u2019s vehicle production outlook without seeking approval from its lawyers.  In a Friday order, the judge gave both sides until April 18 to reach a resolution. If they do not, the judge said she would decide whether to hold Musk in contempt. If he is held in contempt, the judge would allow discussions on possible sanctions. \u201cI understand those who are skeptical and who feel that it\u2019s innovative relief \u2013 to me it was important relief and I thought enforcement took very reasonable steps, both to the nature of the relief and our oversight of that relief,\u201d added Jackson of the judge\u2019s order.  The SEC, which had sued Tesla, asked the company in September to consider removing Musk. The CEO agreed to step down as Tesla\u2019s chairman in an agreement that also required preapproval of Musk\u2019s written communications that could be material to the company, such as volumes of cars produced or other information likely to change the value of its securities. In a statement by Tesla on Thursday, Musk said \u201cthe tweet in question was true, immaterial to shareholders, and in no way a violation of my agreement.\u201d  The SEC said the first of the Feb. 19 tweets conflicted with Tesla\u2019s Jan. 30 outlook, when it targeted annualized Model 3 production exceeding 500,000 as soon as the fourth quarter, and projected 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries this year.  At the time the SEC also said Musk had violated their agreement by sending a tweet that had not been vetted by Tesla\u2019s lawyers and he should be held in contempt. It did not say what penalties it wanted imposed, raising the question of whether it would again seek his removal or propose less drastic measures.","1302":"Flags fly over the Tesla Inc.

REUTERS\/Aly Song  Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self Driving\u201d software would be an important source of revenue, once it is fully deployed. Tesla owners have paid $8,000 up front in hopes of eventually receiving the upgrade. In the second quarter alone, Tesla recognized $48 million of FSD deferred revenue. Tesla reports third-quarter results after the New York market closes on Wednesday.  WHAT DOES \u2018SELF-DRIVING\u2019 MEAN?  The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and most automakers define five levels of automation here Levels 0 to 2 include features such as automated braking systems (ABS) and lane departure warnings that need to be supervised by a driver. Liability for vehicle behaviour rests with the vehicle owner rather than the manufacturer.  Several automakers say they are ready to deploy Level 3 systems that automate highway driving, but require drivers to remain ready to take control.  IS TESLA CAPABLE OF AUTONOMOUS DRIVING ANYWHERE?  No. Tesla has said its system is only capable of functioning on highways.  Tesla\u2019s Autopilot has been criticized by the National Transportation Safety Board for allowing drivers to turn their attention from the road, leading to deadly accidents.  European crash test officials at European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) gave Tesla's Model 3 a \"moderate\" rating here and said the name Autopilot is inappropriate since it suggests full automation.  German courts have banned Tesla from repeating misleading claims about the car\u2019s self-driving capabilities.  The United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which awarded Tesla the highest safety score for occupant safety, has investigated 15 crashes since 2016 involving Tesla vehicles equipped with Autopilot.  WHEN WILL TESLA LAUNCH ROBOTAXIS?  In April 2019, Musk said fleets of self-driving robotaxis would be on roads by 2020.  On Sept. 22, 2020, during the company\u2019s \u201cBattery Day\u201d presentation, Musk admitted that Autopilot software was undergoing a \u201cfundamental rewrite.\u201d  WHAT SYSTEM DOES TESLA CURRENTLY USE?  Tesla uses eight cameras, radar and ultrasonic sensors to enable its vehicles to navigate streets. It opted against using Lidar, a sensor that Audi and Mercedes say is vital to corroborate information gathered by cameras. \u201cAnyone who is relying on Lidar is doomed. Doomed,\u201d Musk said last year.  HOW IS SELF-DRIVING TECHNOLOGY REGULATED?  Technology to automate highway driving, parking and navigation in stop-and-go traffic is being deployed in an absence of industry-wide standards.  Article 8 of the 1968 Convention on Road Traffic states: \u201cEvery driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle or to guide his animals.\u201d  Lawmakers across the globe have worked to incorporate a little-noticed amendment to the United Nations Convention on Road Traffic agreed in 2014, into national rules. This would let drivers take their hands off the wheel of self-driving cars.  The U.S. states of Nevada and Arizona passed laws to allow test drives of autonomous vehicles there. Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google tested a car in Nevada in 2012 and in October said it will start offering rides to the public in robotaxi minivans in Phoenix.  California also allows limited testing of driverless autonomous vehicles.  Mercedes-Benz is now getting ready to launch a Level 3 system in Germany next year, once German law allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel for extended periods of time.","1305":"(This February 9 story corrects paragraph 12 to read \u201cr\/TSLA\u201d instead of \u201cr\/TESLA\u201d subreddit.)

Tesla said it started purchasing bitcoin in January. The New York Post added that with the timeline on the Reddit post, Tesla would have had to start buying bitcoin in late December.  Moderators in r\/TSLA, a subreddit dedicated to posts on the electric carmaker's technology and stock price, previously appeared to remove the post here. It was left up in r\/bitcoin, where the cryptocurrency is discussed.  Reddit posters were revisiting the post on Tuesday in the light of Tesla\u2019s disclosure. \u201cThanks for the heads up Elon,\u201d noted one poster, Valoured, on Tuesday. \u201cSend me a PM (Private Message) before you make your next move please.\u201d  The power of social media users on forums such as Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets to band together and move prices has come into focus in recent weeks, after a surge of retail buying helped fuel wild rides in shares of GameStop Corp and other so-called meme stocks. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last week vowed to protect investors, but said financial market regulators needed to fully understand the recent trading frenzy involving GameStop Corp and other retail stocks before taking any action.

REUTERS\/Sam Mircovich  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tesla is speeding toward capital-raise crunch time. The electric-car maker on Wednesday reported a loss of $710 million in the first three months of the year. It also experienced a slew of other problems, including annoying a regulator after disclosing information about a fatal crash and losing more key staff.  Elon Musk\u2019s big challenges are ones he has set himself. First, he charged his employees with boosting production of the Model 3 sedan to 5,000 units a month by the end of June \u2013 having reduced the goal three times last fall and winter. The company often misses production targets, most recently at the end of the first quarter. And Wednesday\u2019s earnings brief included a warning about how \u201cprior experience has demonstrated the difficulty of accurately forecasting specific production rates at specific points in time.\u201d  That could have been boilerplate language for Tesla for at least two years. Missing those targets imperils Musk\u2019s other main goal of being profitable in the third and fourth quarters this year \u2013 excluding the very real cost of stock-based compensation.  If Tesla stays in the red, it\u2019ll keep burning cash. Some $750 million went into the incinerator last quarter. Musk is pushing staff to rein in spending and in a recently leaked email said any outlays of more than $1 million would need his approval. But at last quarter\u2019s rate, the company will halve its remaining cash in six months.  That could put Musk in the uncomfortable position of having to raise money from stock or bond investors while they\u2019re more skeptical about Tesla\u2019s outlook, and his leadership. There are already signs he\u2019s not quite as beloved: only 73 percent of so-called disinterested shareholders backed his bumper 10-year bonus plan at a special meeting last month. That\u2019s quite a low approval rating for executive pay.  It would be better to go cap in hand to the markets now, after a near-20 percent rally in the past month that erased half of its decline since late February. Otherwise Musk risks being hostage to more bad news.","1309":"(Repeats with no change to text)  * China EV maker funding this year is just 13% of year-ago level  * Bankers say investors have little interest in EV funding  * Sentiment hit by cuts to subsidies, problems at Tesla, Nio  By Kane Wu, Yilei Sun and Julie Zhu  HONG KONG\/BEIJING, June 19 (Reuters) - Last year, Wei Qing and his private equity investment team visited more than 20 Chinese electric vehicle manufacturing startups.  The end result? They decided not to invest in any.  \u201cThere are too many uncertainties from when a company tells a story in the early stage, to when it produces a sample car and raises funds, to the eventual mass production,\u201d said Wei, managing director at Shanghai-based Sailing Capital.  Wei, who declined to name the EV makers his team visited, said he thinks only a few of them will survive. Sailing instead decided to invest in an EV parts supplier, he added.  His concerns reflect what bankers describe as increasingly tough funding times for Chinese EV makers which must jostle for attention in a crowded sector and produce convincing arguments about future profitability despite government cuts to EV subsidies and plans to phase them out.  Numerous setbacks plaguing Tesla Inc in its quest for sustained profitability as well as a dramatic slide in sales and problems with some cars at Chinese startup Nio Inc have also put investors on their guard.  This year, Chinese EV makers have raised just $783.1 million as of mid-June compared with $6 billion for the same period a year earlier and $7.7 billion for all of 2018, according to data provider PitchBook.  One Hong Kong-based banker said he had been approached by at least a dozen EV makers seeking new funds but had to pass on most of them as they were not able to set themselves apart from the crowd.  Even fundraising efforts that have gotten off the ground are not moving as fast as EV makers would like.  \u201cIt is challenging,\u201d said the banker who began working on one fundraising this year. \u201cIf you can get a meeting with investors, you can always tell a story, but some don\u2019t even reply to your requests for a meeting.\u201d  He declined to be identified as the negotiations were not public.  SUBSIDY WOES  Eager to curb smog and jump-start its own auto industry, China has said it wants so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs) - which also include hybrids, plug-in hybrids and fuel cell cars - to account for a fifth of auto sales by 2025 compared with 5% now.  Those ambitions have spawned a plethora of EV startups competing not just with each other, but also global automakers and Tesla, which plans to start production in China this year.  About 330 EV firms are registered for some sort of subsidy, government data shows, although the number of more well established startups is much smaller, at around 50.  But amid criticism that some firms have become overly reliant on government funds, Beijing has reduced subsidies, raised the standards needed for vehicles to qualify and flagged they will end altogether after 2020.  That has led to sharp slowdown as vehicle prices rise. Sales of NEVs in May rose just 1.8% from a year earlier compared with 18.1% in April, and 62% growth for 2018.  Surviving in the current funding environment, requires much cost discipline, Daniel Kirchert, CEO at Nanjing-based EV maker Byton, told Reuters.  \u201cGiven the current situation, it is not enough for any startup to come up with good products and be fast to market. At least it\u2019s equally important to manage cost. Not only fixed costs but variable cost,\u201d he said.  Byton, which is backed by state-owned automaker FAW Group and battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co (CATL) is one of a few EV makers with a fundraising round in train, seeking $500 million.  Others include Leap Motor, backed by state-owned Shanghai Electric Group Corp and Sequoia Capital China, which is seeking $372 million as well as CHJ Automotive, founded by serial entrepreneur Li Xiang, which wants to raise as much as $500 million.  Those with successful funding under their belts this year include Baidu Inc-backed WM Motor Technology Co Ltd which closed a $446 million round in March, according to PitchBook.  Some have obtained money outside private equity. E-Town Capital, a Beijing government investment firm, will invest 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) in a joint venture with Nio, which could help Nio build its own plant.  TESLA, NIO WEIGH  But overall, industry funding prospects are much bleaker, particularly as Tesla and Nio struggle.  Founder Elon Musk told Tesla employees last month the $2.7 billion the company recently raised would give it just 10 months to break even at the rate it burned cash in the first quarter. Shares in the industry pioneer have slid 32% in the year to date.  Nio\u2019s shares have been hit harder, down 60% this year on a cut to its delivery outlook, a halving in first-quarter sales from the previous quarter, increased competition and reduced subsidies. Its reputation has also been hurt after three vehicles caught on fire and by the inadvertent shutting down of a car on Beijing\u2019s prestigious Changan Avenue after the driver initiated a software update.  Nio declined to comment.  \u201cSome of the listed EV industry leaders are currently underperforming in the secondary trading market and that has created pressures for the sector\u2019s short-term outlook,\u201d said Brian Gu, president of EV startup Xpeng Motors and a former senior JP Morgan banker.  \u201cWe are seeing investors become more cautious, selective and keenly focused on the frontrunners. I think this trend is likely to persist,\u201d he said.  An investor in WM Motor was more downbeat about the willingness of private equity investors to fund the industry.  \u201cNio is probably the best among Chinese EV start-ups. Look where it stands now - how can that make us comfortable about writing cheques for other EV start-ups?\u201d said the investor who also held Nio shares but sold them this year.

The Model 3, initially promised at a base price of $35,000, is meant to be the mass market vehicle that can propel electric-powered vehicles into the mainstream and Tesla into profitability.

GM Chief Executive Mary Barra and her top executives will host an investor conference in New York. They hope to convince potential shareholders GM is more than just a company in a cyclical industry, but a burgeoning technology firm at the forefront of tomorrow\u2019s electric and self-driving cars.  Barra has been restructuring GM\u2019s operations and stressing her goals of readying GM for a future of \u201czero emissions and zero accidents\u201d for several years.  Still, GM shares trade just above the $33 share price of its November 2010 initial public offering. That has left it with a market capitalization of about $49 billion, compared with Tesla\u2019s valuation of about $160 billion. Tesla shares surged on Tuesday, extending a rally that has more than doubled the company\u2019s market value since the start of the year.  Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas on Monday captured GM\u2019s conundrum in an analyst note entitled, \u201cGM\u2019s Investor Day: What More Can They Do?\u201d  The bulk of GM\u2019s profits is still derived from the fuel-hungry pickup trucks and SUVs sold in the United States. The Chinese market has been the source of a steady $2 billion in profits a year, but that is threatened by a market slowdown, rising costs for electrification and now the disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak.  Barra\u2019s challenge now is to assure investors that GM can make the leap across the gap separating its profitable internal combustion present and an uncertain electric future.  While gasoline-powered vehicles will make up a large portion of U.S. sales into the 2030s, GM will spend more on developing electric vehicles than those with internal combustion engines over the next five years, Barra said in October.  In December, GM and South Korea\u2019s LG Chem said they would invest $2.3 billion to build an EV battery cell joint venture plant in Ohio, creating one of the world\u2019s largest battery facilities.  That same month, GM\u2019s Cadillac chief said most if not all of the vehicles offered by the luxury brand would be electric by 2030.  GM said last week it would invest $2.2 billion in its Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant to build electric trucks and SUVs, including the Cruise Origin, a driverless vehicle for ride-sharing service. GM plans to offer electric trucks, including a premium electric GMC Hummer pickup truck in fall 2021.","1318":"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German auto supplier Eisenmann, which supplied Tesla TSLA.O in 2015 with a new paint shop at its Freemont plant in California, filed for insolvency late on Monday, in a sign of the growing economic problems crushing profits in the auto sector.  Eisenmann, which has 3,000 employees and generated annual revenues of 723 million euros ($806 million) in 2017, filed for insolvency at the Stuttgart District Court.  The Boeblingern, Germany-based company said it was now looking for a strategic partner for its Paint & Assembly, as well as its Application Technology businesses. Potential buyers have already expressed interest, Eisenmann said.  The insolvency comes as bigger auto suppliers and carmakers including Daimler and Continental have issued profit warnings, triggered by a worse-than-expected downturn in demand for auto production.  Eisenmann ran into liquidity problems because major projects started in 2018 led to a large year-on-year loss, it said. A spokeswoman declined to specify which projects had pushed the company into insolvency.  \u201cThis is another example of the extreme supplier pressure these days. We do not foresee the environment getting any better soon,\u201d analysts at Evercore ISI said in a note on Tuesday.","1319":"HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Tesla Inc electric car caught fire in a parking lot in a Hong Kong shopping mall, the Apple Daily newspaper said on Tuesday, but no one was injured in the blaze, whose cause was not immediately known.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Every domestic automaker landed in the bottom half of the magazine\u2019s new-car reliability rankings, which include data collected for more than 500,000 vehicles. The survey, which ranked 29 brands in the U.S. market, was released on Wednesday.  \u201cIt\u2019s the complexities that have really dragged down Tesla,\u201d said Jake Fisher, the magazine\u2019s director of auto testing. \u201cThe majority of the problems that we\u2019re seeing with Tesla truly are mechanical issues.\u201d  The Model S appears similar to the model launched six years ago, but Tesla has made significant mechanical and software changes over the past few years, including making air suspension and all-wheel-drive standard, he said. That can hurt reliability as more complexity is added.  Tesla said it had streamlined and simplified Model S configurations, not made them more complex. It also said the issues cited by owners in the Consumer Reports survey had previously been addressed by the carmaker, including with over-the-air software updates.  \u201cNot only are our cars the safest and best performing vehicles available today, but we take feedback from our customers very seriously and quickly implement improvements,\u201d the company said in a statement.  Tesla said that was why the Model S has been top ranked on Consumer Reports\u2019 owner satisfaction survey every year since 2013, when the carmaker was first included.  Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Lexus and Toyota brands took the top two spots in the survey, as they have for six consecutive years. The survey results can be found at CR.org\/reliability.  The magazine\u2019s annual survey of new vehicle reliability predicts which cars will give owners fewer or more problems than their competitors, based on data collected. Its scorecard is influential among consumers and industry executives.  Tesla's ranking slid to No. 27, ahead of only General Motors Co's GM.N Cadillac brand and Volvo.  The Model S, which starts at $74,500, dropped to \u201cBelow Average\u201d from \u201cAbove Average\u201d last year, and its overall score denied it Consumer Reports\u2019 \u201cRecommended\u201d tag. Owners reported suspension problems and other issues, including problems with the extending door handle, the magazine said.  Tesla\u2019s Model X SUV remained \u201cMuch Worse Than Average\u201d with ongoing problems, including with the falcon-wing doors and center display screen. The Model 3 sedan, seen as key to Tesla\u2019s profitability, debuted with \u201cAverage\u201d reliability.  In May, Consumer Reports recommended the Model 3 after its latest tests showed a software update improved the car\u2019s braking. It has maintained that rating.  Tesla was scheduled to report third-quarter results after the market close on Wednesday.  Other domestic brand rankings included: Ford Motor Co's F.N Ford and Lincoln brands at No. 18 and 20; GM's Buick, Chevrolet and GMC brands at No. 19, 23 and 25; and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' FCHA.MI Dodge, Jeep, Chrysler and Ram brands at No. 21, 22, 24 and 26, respectively.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  \u201cHe needs help, and I mean that psychologically as much as practically,\u201d said asset manager Baillie Gifford\u2019s James Anderson, the fund manager of Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, which owns Tesla shares.  Anderson told Reuters he has talked with Musk about the idea of bringing in another executive. Analysts have been calling for Tesla to add a chief operating officer or other new blood to top management.  Tesla, whose shares were up 3.1 percent in afternoon trading after earlier being up 4.5 percent, could not immediately be reached to comment. SEC officials also could not immediately be reached.  The last few months have been tumultuous and chaotic for Tesla and its eclectic CEO. While Tesla was wrestling to ramp up production of its mass-market electric Model 3 sedan, on Aug. 7 Musk tweeted that he was considering taking the company private at $420 per share and that funding was \u201csecured.\u201d  On the evening of Aug. 24, a Friday, Musk, by then facing U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission scrutiny into the factual accuracy of his financing tweet, blogged that Tesla would remain public, citing investor resistance.  Musk was \u201cgetting there\u201d on the idea of accepting more help in running the company, Anderson said.  Anderson said that he had suggested to Musk his tweets are \u201cnot a great thing\u201d and added that the firm had been talking to the SEC about Musk\u2019s proposal and financing claims.  \u201cI don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll do with him, but there\u2019s no implication that we\u2019ve done anything wrong,\u201d Anderson said in an interview at the firm\u2019s London office. \u201cI think quite naturally they wanted to know whether major shareholders had any lead indication or knowledge of the tweet about \u2018funding secured.\u2019\u201d  The next two largest Tesla institutional shareholders, T. Rowe Price Group TROW.O and Fidelity Investments, both declined to comment on whether they have spoken with the SEC about Tesla.  Anderson said he had spoken with Musk twice and was arranging to speak with the company\u2019s board.  Anderson added that the media coverage around the going-private comments has not shaken his belief in Tesla or its \u201cextraordinary\u201d CEO.  \u201cWe think there is a decent chance that they can prove to be an extremely profitable, competitively advantaged company which will produce high returns,\u201d Anderson said.  Musk has said that Tesla should become profitable in the second half of the year.  Tesla may need to raise more capital and would have a better idea of its needs in the next few months, Anderson said, adding he would support such a move.","1327":"Tesla Motors Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk pauses during a news conference in Tokyo September 8, 2014. REUTERS\/Toru Hanai  LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman risks picking the wrong driver. The kingdom\u2019s sovereign wealth fund already holds nearly 5 percent of Tesla and expressed interest in taking the electric-vehicle innovator private, according to boss Elon Musk. That\u2019d be a dicey way to diversify away from oil.  At first glance, $60 billion Tesla fits the crown prince\u2019s mandate to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. The company\u2019s Model S was the most popular all-electric car in North America and Europe by sales last year, according to Citi. Musk has also poured money into battery-storage technology. That makes Tesla a natural hedge as and when demand falls for the Gulf state\u2019s traditional cash cow, oil.  Musk reckons about two-thirds of investors would still want to hold shares in a private Tesla. Saudi\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, the likely investment vehicle according to a Monday blog post by Musk, could therefore buy the rest for about $24 billion at the mooted $420 per share price.  The desert kingdom is hardly cash-strapped, but that\u2019s 10 percent of the Public Investment Fund\u2019s assets, according to Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute data. Few portfolio managers would fancy such concentration. The bulk of the fund\u2019s $250 billion of resources is tied up in Saudi companies, and $65 billion is earmarked for a Blackstone infrastructure venture fund and SoftBank\u2019s mammoth tech fund.  Either way, Tesla might not be the wisest way to bet on electric cars. BMW, General Motors and Volkswagen are investing heavily and have enviable production scale and know-how. Tesla\u2019s sales have dipped as much as 30 percent in European countries since rival models launched, Bloomberg reported, citing IHS and government data which Tesla disputes.  Crucially, the buyout price means the crown prince risks paying away much of his potential upside. At $420 per share, loss-making Tesla\u2019s enterprise value of $81 billion including debt is four times 2018 revenue, using Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S. Slower-growing but profitable carmakers are generally valued at around one times revenue. Battery specialist BYD and renewable-energy groups Siemens Gamesa and Vestas Wind are valued at roughly the same level, according to Eikon.  While a shiny new Tesla is cooler than a row of turbines, the crown prince has cheaper ways to play the energy transition.","1328":"July 2 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Thursday beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter vehicle deliveries, as lockdowns imposed globally to combat the spread of the coronavirus begin to ease.  The electric-car maker delivered 90,650 vehicles during the quarter, above estimates of 74,130 vehicles, according to Refinitiv data.","1329":"WASHINGTON, April 12 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc said it is withdrawing as a formal party to the National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s probe into a fatal March 23 crash in California in which the semi-autonomous \u201cAutopilot\u201d driving system was in use.  The automaker\u2019s unusual step means it may not be privy to some information obtained by investigators before it is made public. Tesla\u2019s announcement, made late Wednesday in California, came after the company publicly blamed the driver for the crash and made a series of statements about the incident that drew criticism from the NTSB.  Driver Walter Huang died in last month\u2019s crash and vehicle fire in a Tesla Inc Model X near Mountain View, California, prompting investigations by the NTSB and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  Tesla said in a statement it withdrew because the party agreement with the NTSB required \u201cthat we not release information about Autopilot to the public, a requirement which we believe fundamentally affects public safety negatively.\u201d Autopilot is a semi-autonomous system that handles some driving tasks.  NTSB spokesman Peter Knudson declined to comment on a Bloomberg News report that the board had removed Tesla\u2019s party status before the company\u2019s announcement, but said the agency would issue a formal statement later on Thursday. Being a party to an NTSB investigation requires participants to agree to limits on the \u201cdissemination of investigation information,\u201d the NTSB website says.  Tesla chief executive Elon Musk and NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt spoke over the weekend. Sumwalt told Reuters on Tuesday the NTSB had a good working relationship with Tesla, but added that companies must follow the rules if they are a formal party.  In its statement, Tesla said \u201can agreement that prevents public release of information for over a year is unacceptable. Even though we won\u2019t be a formal party, we will continue to provide technical assistance to the NTSB.\u201d  Huang\u2019s family said on Wednesday it had hired law firm Minami Tamaki LLP to explore legal options, adding the law firm believed the Autopilot feature probably caused his death. The firm said its preliminary review of the crash suggested Autopilot was defective and said it had uncovered complaints by other Tesla drivers of navigational errors by the system.  The NTSB has not disclosed any findings from the probe.  Tesla has said Huang had activated Autopilot and it was in operation at the time of the crash. The company said vehicle logs from the accident showed no action had been taken by Huang before the crash and that he had received warnings from the system to put his hands on the wheel.  While sympathizing with the family, Tesla again blamed Huang on Wednesday, saying the driver was well aware that Autopilot was not perfect and, specifically, he had previously told them it was not reliable in that exact location, but nonetheless he engaged Autopilot.  Tesla said the Autopilot system always reminds drivers to be alert and to have hands on the wheel.  The NTSB confirmed earlier this week it has two other pending investigations of other Tesla crashes, including a probe of an August 2017 Tesla battery fire in Lake Forest, California, that occurred after an owner lost control and ran into his garage. That fire probe had not previously been reported.

The 11 percent jump in Tesla\u2019s stock price following Musk\u2019s public musings on possibly buying the company from existing shareholders drove $2.3 billion of convertible debt past the level at which investors can swap them for stock at a profit.  Tesla shares ended the day at $379.57, within reach of their all-time high and more than 5 percent above the bonds\u2019 conversion price of $359.8676.  \u201cThis is great news for any bondholder any way you spin it,\u201d said Ross Gerber, chief executive of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management who owns both the convertibles and the stock.  \u201cMost of these bonds are convertible notes, so we can choose to convert into stock at a huge profit,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a boon for any bondholder at Tesla, because most of the bonds are convertible notes.\u201d  Convertibles give bondholders the right to trade their debt for equity after shares rise over a certain set price.  The $2.3 billion in debt that investors can now take in equity rather than cash removes pressure from the cash-strapped company which has about $9.5 billion in long-term debt, according to its latest financial statements.  After first issuing a tweet that he was mulling the idea of taking Tesla private, Musk on Tuesday said in a letter to employees that he would prefer to run Tesla as a private company to allow it to operate away from the attention it receives due to its notoriously volatile stock price.  While no final decision has been made, he suggested a buyout price of $420 per share.  Investors like billionaire George Soros now have the option to take advantage of Tesla\u2019s recovering share price, as the company\u2019s $920 million convertible bond due in March 2019 passed its $359.8676 conversion rate.  Soros Fund Management LLC took a $35 million stake in the 2019 Tesla convertible bonds in May of 2018.  The company\u2019s $1.38 billion convertible bond due in March 2021 also passed the same conversion rate.  The convertibles have oscillated between being in and out of the money several times over the last year.  They first rose above the conversion price in June 2017 and Tesla\u2019s stock price hit a record high of $389.61 in September last year. The stock then plunged to as low as $244.59 in April as the company struggled to meet production targets for its Model 3 sedan and Moody\u2019s Investors Service cut Tesla\u2019s credit rating deep into junk-bond territory.  Tesla on Aug. 1 reported that it had ended the second quarter with $2.78 billion in cash after spending $610 million in capital expenses, while its negative free cash flow narrowed.  Tesla has been burning through cash as manufacturing problems have thwarted its ability to meet production targets for its Model 3 sedan.  The company also has a $1.8 billion high-yield bonds, which rose to 92 cents on the dollar on Tuesday, up half a cent and the highest since mid-June.

Musk on Wednesday tweeted \u201cYes\u201d to a question on Twitter about whether the report of the leaked Semi truck production email was accurate.  Tesla's shares rose about 6% to hit $1,000 on Wednesday after Reuters reported Musk's email, making the Silicon Valley company the second-most valuable automaker in the world, behind Japan's Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T. Tesla's share surge could position Musk for another payout from a stock compensation plan tied to the company's market capitalization.

More recently, he said the Semi would go into volume production by 2021.  Musk's Tuesday message coincides with a surge in the share price of rival clean truck maker Nikola Corp NKLA.O.  Nikola, an electric and fuel cell truck startup, earlier this month began trading on the NASDAQ after it merged with special purpose acquisition company VectoIQ.  Shares in Nikola have more than doubled in price over the past week as the company\u2019s CEO has used Twitter and interviews to promote plans to launch an electric pickup truck to Tesla\u2019s forthcoming Cybertruck.

The discussions with Cortica could lead to an investment or even an acquisition, Globes said.  Cortica says its technology enables self-driving cars to identify moving parts in its environment and make informed decisions, even predicting changes likely to occur in its surroundings.  Officials at Cortica could not immediately be reached for comment.  Cortica has raised nearly $70 million since it was founded in 2007. Investors include Hong Kong-based Horizons Ventures and Russia\u2019s Mail.ru Group, according to Start-Up National Central.  Tesla previously collaborated with Israeli company Mobileye but the companies parted ways in 2016 after a fatal crash involving a Tesla Model S using Autopilot, a semi-automated system designed to assist with driving but not replace the driver.  Intel acquired Mobileye last year for $15.3 billion.  Musk\u2019s visit to Israel was highlighted by several websites, including Globes, after he posted a video of himself on Instagram at a bar in Jerusalem. (Reporting by Tova Cohen.

Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk had said last month that the company was on course to deliver a record number of cars in the quarter, beating the 90,700 it sent to customers in the final quarter of last year.  Musk reiterated on Tuesday that the company has enough orders to set a quarterly record for vehicle deliveries, according to a leaked email cited by Bloomberg.  \u201cWe already have enough vehicle orders to set a record, but the right cars are not yet all in the right locations,\u201d Musk was quoted as having said in the mail to Tesla employees.  Electrek did not give any delivery number for international markets for the quarter.  The Electrek report said that when international market numbers are added, especially in places like Norway and China, Tesla will get pretty close to a new record.  It has over 12,000 additional orders as well and Tesla could end the quarter by delivering 61,000 vehicles in North America, the report said, citing sources inside the company. The report also says, citing a source familiar with the matter, that Tesla has delivered 22,000 vehicles in North America in June so far.  In the first quarter, Tesla reported a 31% fall in deliveries, sparking concerns about the company\u2019s ability to make profits and meet its delivery targets while it grapples with issues related to cash flow and manufacturing.  Demand for Tesla\u2019s Model 3 sedan and other cars have also moved to the top of investors\u2019 list of worries after the company reported slack first-quarter demand against a backdrop of U.S.-China trade tensions.","1336":"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla has started delivering Model 3 electric cars built at its Shanghai factory in just under a year since it began work on the $2 billion plant, a record for global automakers in China, and said it would ramp up deliveries from next month.  The U.S. electric vehicle maker marked the start with an event on Monday where 15 Tesla employees received cars they had purchased, one of whom took the opportunity to propose marriage to his girlfriend after getting his new set of wheels.  The China-made Model 3 sedans are priced at 355,800 yuan ($50,000) before subsidies. Imported Model 3 vehicles start at 439,000 yuan for the longer-range version, while the standard range plus model costs under $40,000 in the United States.  The Shanghai plant, up and running in just 357 days, is part of Tesla\u2019s plans to bolster its presence in the world\u2019s biggest car market and minimize the impact of the U.S.-China trade war.  The automaker, which previously imported all the cars it sold in China, had said it wanted to start deliveries from the Shanghai plant before the Lunar New Year beginning on Jan. 25.  \u201cFrom now onwards China-made Model 3 vehicles will start running on China\u2019s large streets and small lanes,\u201d Tesla Vice President Tao Lin said at the delivery ceremony which was attended by employees and Shanghai government officials.  China General Manager for the Silicon Valley carmaker Wang Hao said Tesla plans to ramp up Model 3 deliveries in January.  Slideshow ( 10 images )  The Chinese government has been supportive of the factory, the first wholly foreign-owned car plant and a reflection of Beijing\u2019s broader shift to open up its auto market.  CHINA PUSH  Tesla has taken a different approach to the Chinese market, the world\u2019s biggest for electric vehicles with 1.3 million new-energy vehicles sold last year, as is evident from its marketing blitz in the country that is quite unlike anywhere else.  The company and its flamboyant billionaire CEO Elon Musk openly disdain marketing, but in China Tesla has offered racing events and showroom parties.  It is also building service centers and charging stations across China to assure customers of standardized after-sales service, Tesla\u2019s senior executives said, confirming a Reuters report on the plans published last month.  The car maker will double the number of service centers and fast charging stations in China next year, and plans to more than double its after-sales workforce to 1,500 from about 600 currently, the executives added.  Wang also told reporters the plant had achieved a production target of 1,000 units a week, or around 280 cars a day, and that sales for the China-made sedan had so far been \u201cvery good\u201d.","1337":"FILE PHOTO: Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk speaks at an opening ceremony for Tesla China-made Model Y program in Shanghai, China January 7, 2020.

There is no risk to any Tesla employees from the July 3 visit,\u201d Charlie Hannema, a spokesman for Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt said in a statement, adding an additional meeting with Tesla executives on Monday was conducted virtually over Zoom.  \u201cThe science now is that an infected person is only possibly contagious 48 hours before the onset of symptoms,\u201d Hannema said, adding that since Stitt\u2019s symptoms developed on Monday, anyone in contact with him before Saturday is not at risk of exposure.  Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on whether company employees, including Musk, have been tested for the virus or other measures taken.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on its website here states that the period of infectiousness for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, is not yet known. But it says that based on existing literature, the time from exposure to the development of symptoms ranges from two to 14 days.  The CDC also recommends that anyone who has come in contact with a person who has COVID-19 should stay home for 14 days.  Musk and other Tesla executives met with Stitt and his team on July 3 to visit the site of a potential new Tesla vehicle factory. Oklahoma and Texas are both competing for the new $1.1 billion plant that promises to create thousands of new jobs.","1338":"(Reuters) - Investors in high-flying electric carmaker Tesla Inc are questioning whether Elon Musk\u2019s $1.5 billion outlay into bitcoin will be as good for the company as it has been for the cryptocurrency.

Others may follow Tesla\u2019s lead, with Twitter Inc\u2019s chief financial officer telling CNBC that the company has considered adding bitcoin to its balance sheet.  Shareholders voiced concern that the investment by Tesla, which recently joined the benchmark S&P 500 stock index, could fuel more gyrations in the company\u2019s shares.  \u201cIt will add volatility to the stock due to exposure to bitcoin,\u201d said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Wealth Management, whose firm has owned Tesla shares since 2015. \u201cThis is better for bitcoin than it is for Tesla.\u201d  Gary Black, former chief executive of Aegon Asset Management and now a private investor who has been bullish on Tesla since 2019, on Monday announced here on Twitter that he had sold his Tesla shares. He cited the absence of a 2021 delivery target and the company's riskier capital allocation strategy, among other reasons.  Black also tweeted here on Monday: \"$TSLA has always been higher risk, but investing $1.5B in #Bitcoin makes it more risky.\" He did not respond to a request for comment.  The difficulty of valuing the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency over the long term was also a cause for concern to investors.  \u201cElon Musk has exposed Tesla to immense mark-to-market risk,\u201d Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote in a research note, referring to an accounting method designed to measure the fair value of accounts -- assets and liabilities -- in order to provide a measure of current financial performance.  Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.  Garnry also wrote that investors with concentrated positions in Tesla, such as ARK Invest, are at risk. Tesla is the top holding of the flagship ARK Innovation Fund ark-funds.com\/arkk#holdings, representing 8.75% of the portfolio.  Brett Winton, ARK\u2019s director of research, said Tesla\u2019s bitcoin investment was an \u201cappropriate use of cash\u201d and it did not change the firm\u2019s outlook on the carmaker.  \u201cWe are comfortable with the way in which we are forecasting the positions we are putting our clients in front of,\u201d he said.  On the fixed-income side, investors had mixed views on the impact of the bitcoin investment.  Tom Graff, head of fixed income at Brown Advisory, who holds Tesla\u2019s asset-backed securities tied to the company\u2019s auto leasing business but does not own its corporate bonds, said while bitcoin can be easily converted into cash, \u201cyou don\u2019t know what kind of value you would get or how quickly you could realize that value.\u201d  \u201cIf I were an unsecured bond holder, I would be very unhappy about this,\u201d said Graff.  Another fixed-income investor, who requested anonymity because of a position in Tesla\u2019s bonds, said the volatility would matter more for equity holders as Tesla has sufficient money to pay out its bondholders. Tesla last year raised cash, partly to ease future debt pressures.  Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, holds the greatest portion of outstanding Tesla shares, according to Refinitiv data, followed by Capital World Investors, The Vanguard Group Inc, Baillie Gifford & Co and BlackRock Institutional Trust Inc. Vanguard declined to comment, while Capital World Investors and BlackRock did not respond to inquiries.  Baillie Gifford partner James Anderson told The Times here that he was content with the purchase, but his firm would discuss setting limits on how much could be put into the asset. Baillie Gifford declined comment.  Still, investors in Tesla have been rewarded for sticking with one of Wall Street\u2019s most controversial stocks. Over the past 12 months shares have risen 422%.  Indeed, the popularity of Musk\u2019s outsized public persona may mean that many longtime investors are ultimately inclined to view the move positively.  \u201cI\u2019ve been following this company a long time and \u2026 they make the big decisions right,\u201d said Graham Tanaka, president and chief investment officer of Tanaka Capital Management, which holds Tesla shares.","1339":"(Reuters) - Electric carmaker Tesla Inc stood by its Model 3 safety claims on Wednesday in the face of regulatory scrutiny, while documents showed the top U.S. automotive safety watchdog issued at least five subpoenas since last year seeking information about crashes involving the company\u2019s vehicles.

REUTERS\/Amanda Voisard\/File Photo  Tesla, led by billionaire Elon Musk, has said the Model 3 \u201cwas engineered to be the safest car ever built\u201d with the lowest probability of injury of all vehicles ever tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  Regulators challenged that view last year, according to documents seen by Reuters. The NHTSA sent a cease-and-desist letter to Tesla on Oct. 17, for making \u201cmisleading statements\u201d over safety ratings of the Model 3.  Saying it was \u201cnot the first time\u201d Tesla had disregarded its guidelines in a manner that could confuse consumers and \u201cgive Tesla an unfair market advantage,\u201d the agency also referred the issue to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which investigates unfair or deceptive acts within commerce.  Asked for comment on Wednesday, Tesla pointed to its response to the October letter, in which it said its claims were based on NHTSA\u2019s own data.  In its October letter, NHTSA said Tesla disregarded the difference in relative weights between its vehicles and others, making accurate comparisons impossible and misleading consumers.  \u201cIt is therefore inaccurate to claim that the Model 3 has \u2018the lowest probability of injury of all cars\u2019 or that Model 3 occupants are \u2018less likely to get seriously hurt\u2019 or \u2018have the best chance of avoiding a serious injury,\u2019 wrote NHTSA chief counsel Jonathan Morrison, adding that such statement violate NHTSA\u2019s guidelines.  In its response, Tesla denied it had made the claim that the 5-star rating makes it the \u201csafest vehicle,\u201d rather that Tesla said publicly the car was engineered \u201cto be the safest car ever built.\u201d  Asked to comment on the documents on Wednesday NHTSA did not mention Tesla, instead saying the agency was \u201ccommitted to rigorous and appropriate safety oversight of the industry.\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  An FTC spokesman declined to comment, saying \u201cinvestigations are non-public.\u201d  The Model 3 had received the top rating on the agency\u2019s 5-Star Safety Ratings Program that uses three crash tests and a rollover resistance assessment.  The U.S. Department of Transportation released the documents after legal transparency group PlainSite obtained them under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  QUESTIONS ASKED  Safety groups have criticized Tesla and Musk for being unclear in statements about the capabilities of its partially autonomous driving feature called Autopilot, which falls short of a full self-driving system that would have no need of driver intervention.  Following a death involving Autopilot in 2016, the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates accidents, faulted Autopilot for lacking system safeguards.  The documents revealed that NHTSA sent Tesla at least five subpoenas from April 2018 through March 2019 related to vehicle crashes, with a request for information about another crash sent in June.  At least three of those crashes, which occurred during the last years, caused fatalities: in Delray Beach and Key Largo, Florida and in Mountain View.  It was unclear from the documents whether Autopilot was engaged.

Tesla\u2019s share price fell 1.8 percent on Tuesday morning following the report which came out during the Asian business day. Hours later, the company responded from its headquarters in California, calling the industry group\u2019s report \u201cwildly inaccurate.\u201d  An official from China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) said data from the industry body showed Tesla sold just 211 cars in the world\u2019s largest auto market in October.  Tesla representatives in China did not respond to repeated calls and written requests for comment during the Asia work day. Later, a California-based spokesman issued a written statement saying Tesla disputed the CPCA\u2019s data, but he did not provide internal sales figures.  \u201cThis is wildly inaccurate. While we do not disclose regional or monthly sales numbers, these figures are off by a significant margin,\u201d he said in the statement.  The electric carmaker, which imports all the cars it sells in China, said in October that tariff hikes on auto imports were hammering its sales there. In July, Beijing raised tariffs on imports of U.S. autos to 40 percent amid a worsening trade standoff with the United States.  While so-called new-energy vehicle sales have continued to climb in China, wider auto sales have slowed sharply since the middle of the year, taking the market to the brink of its first annual sales contraction in almost three decades.  Tesla, led by billionaire CEO Elon Musk, said last week it was cutting the price of its Model X and Model S cars in China in a shift in strategy to make the cars \u201cmore affordable\u201d and absorb more of the hit from higher tariffs.  Tesla recently secured the site for its first overseas factory in Shanghai that will help it avoid the steep tariffs.","1341":"NEW YORK\/BEIJING (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O cannot continue to operate its main U.S. vehicle plant normally as its San Francisco Bay Area home began a three-week lockdown on Tuesday to slow the spread of coronavirus, a county sheriff's office spokesman said.  The comment relates to Tesla\u2019s factory in Fremont, Alameda County, which employs more than 10,000 workers and recorded annualized production of about 415,000 electric vehicles as at the end of December.  The order comes as Tesla ramps up production of its Model Y sport-utility vehicle at the factory. Billionaire Chief Executive Elon Musk has said the model will see higher demand than all of Tesla\u2019s other models combined.  Alameda is one of at least nine counties covered by a \u2018shelter in place\u2019 order that limits activity, travel and business functions to only the most essential, and advises people to stay home except for the most crucial reasons.  It is aimed at helping stem a pandemic which has affected nearly 200,000 people worldwide and killed more than 100 in the United States including 12 in California.  The order will be an additional headache for Tesla, which was forced to shut down its $2 billion Shanghai factory for 10 days on top of the traditional week-long Lunar New Year holiday this year due to the rapidly spreading coronavirus.  \u201cTesla is not an essential business as defined in the Alameda County Health Order. Tesla can maintain minimum basic operations per the Alameda County Health Order,\u201d the spokesman said.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Under the order announced Monday afternoon, businesses deemed non-essential can only maintain minimum basic operations, such as maintaining the value of inventory, ensuring security and processing payroll and employee benefits. Violations or failure to comply is punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both.  The spokesman said his office had not spoken to Tesla since implementing the order, which takes effect from Tuesday.  Tesla did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Its share price fell 5.1% in after-hours trade on Tuesday.  The order is the latest to hit the global auto industry, which has taken a major hit from the outbreak.  The Big Three Detroit automakers - General Motors Co GM.N, Ford Motor Co F.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI - and the United Auto Workers union agreed Tuesday to curtail production at U.S. factories and limit the number of workers on the job at one time.  Prior to the county\u2019s order, Tesla had told employees in an email that the automaker and its suppliers would continue operations supporting manufacturing and vehicle delivery, a person who had seen the email told Reuters.  In another memo on Monday, Musk told employees he was not aware of any workers who had tested positive for the virus, and urged them to stay home if they felt the \u201cslightest bit ill or even uncomfortable\u201d, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.  California\u2019s Department of Public Health in a statement said it would issue shutdown guidelines for manufacturing facilities in the days ahead.  Bay Area counties had reported 273 coronavirus infections by Monday. California has reported 12 deaths from the COVID-19 respiratory illness caused by the virus.","1342":"OSLO (Reuters) - Rules governing Norway's $1 trillion wealth fund would allow it to stay on as an investor in Tesla TSLA.O if the electric carmaker goes private, its deputy CEO said on Tuesday.

REUTERS\/SCANPIX Gorm Kallestad  Tesla CEO Elon Musk stunned financial markets this month when he revealed on Twitter he was considering a $420 per share take-private deal for the money-losing carmaker.  Norway is Tesla\u2019s third-biggest market and the country\u2019s wealth fund, the world\u2019s biggest sovereign wealth fund, had a 0.48 percent stake in Tesla worth about $253 million as of the start of 2018, according to the latest data from the fund.  Tesla shares have been hit by investor concerns about Musk\u2019s plan, and doubts about whether the company has secured the funding to go private, and the SEC has opened an inquiry related to Musk\u2019s tweets, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.  Trond Grande, deputy CEO of the Norwegian fund, declined to say whether Tesla had approached the fund about going private.  However, he said that although the fund\u2019s main practice is to sell its stake when a company leaves an exchange, or soon after, rules regulating the fund set by the Norwegian Finance Ministry and parliament do allow it to stay on in a listed company that goes private.  \u201cThe priority is to try to preserve the value for the fund. That is the priority,\u201d Grande told Reuters on the sidelines of an earnings presentation. \u201cIf that means that the fund will be invested in a company that has been delisted for a period of time, that could happen.\u201d  \u201cBut as a main rule, we will exit the investments as and when, or soon after, it has been taken off an exchange,\u201d he said.  CRITICAL OF TESLA  This year the fund has been critical of Tesla\u2019s approach on several issues.  In March it voted against Musk\u2019s potential $2.6 billion payout. Then in June it backed an initiative to wrest the role of chairman away from CEO Musk, and another that would have allowed investors to nominate their own directors.  Grande declined to speak specifically about the situation at Tesla. Generally speaking, he said the fund sees the importance of separating the roles of CEO and chairman and to allow independent directors on boards.  \u201cWe acknowledge some companies do not operate ... in that sense, but we will not change our stance with regards to that,\u201d he said.  The fund owns 1.4 percent of all globally listed shares. It invests in stocks, bonds and real estate worldwide.  In the second quarter, the fund made a return of 1.8 percent, it said on Tuesday, helped by a rise in global equity markets, although it still underperformed the index it is benchmarked against.  \u201cNorth American and European stocks had a positive development in the quarter despite the prospect of increased trade barriers,\u201d Grande told a news conference.  The fund returned 0.2 percentage points less than a benchmark index set by the Norwegian Finance Ministry.","1343":"BEIJING, June 28 (Reuters) - Electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla Inc said on Friday that it has found no systematic flaws in its vehicles following investigation of a vehicle that caught fire in Shanghai.

And I think it\u2019s complicated for many funds,\u201d the person said.  The uncertainty over how many investors could hold private shares, and would want to, would be a challenge for Musk because the final tally would dictate how much capital he would need to raise to buy out those who would sell the stock.  Musk blogged on Monday he was reaching out to top investors to see \u201cwhether they had the ability and desire to remain shareholders in a private Tesla.\u201d  One pool that would likely not be Musk's allies in the effort are big passive vehicles like the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund VSMPX.O.

Vanguard spokeswoman Carolyn Wegemann declined to comment on Tesla but said by email, \u201cAs private companies are not included in indexes, any shares held in an index fund when a company goes private would likely be sold\/tendered.\u201d  A factor that could work in Musk\u2019s favor is that more of his top fund investors are active stockpickers. Active funds would generally have more leeway to continue to own Tesla after a go-private transaction.

Shorts have to shell out $1.22 million every day to keep their position on, the most for any stock in the Russell 3000 Index, according to S3 Partners data.  Selling Tesla short has not always paid off. Shorts logged $2.3 billion in mark-to-market losses in 2017, as the shares soared 45.7 percent for the year.  But the stock has lost 9 percent in 2018 so far as investors fretted about issues such as a federal probe of a fatal crash on March 23 in California involving one of its vehicles and a downgrade of its credit position by Moody\u2019s Investors Service.  Emboldened by production setbacks at the company, short sellers have boosted short interest in the stock by $2.5 billion, or 26 percent, for the year.  That took the overall short interest to $11.94 billion, enlarging what had been, off and on since March 2016, the largest equity bear bet in U.S. markets, according to S3 Partners data.

Tesla delivered 124,100 Model Y and Model 3 units, slightly below Refinitiv consensus expectations of 128,000 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles combined. Some analysts had expected weaker U.S. demand for the mass-market Model 3 due to the release of the Model Y.

Newark, California-based Lucid Motors had in April named here Peter Rawlinson, former chief engineer of Tesla's Model S, as its chief executive officer.  Hochholdinger, who was vice president of production at Tesla\u2019s Fremont factory, left last week after three years with the company.  At Tesla, he was tasked with improving production for Tesla\u2019s luxury Model S sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle as well as helping build a cost-effective manufacturing program for the Model 3 sedan.  His departure is the latest among a string of senior executives to leave Tesla in the past two years, as the company struggles to deliver Model 3 sedans efficiently in international markets. The car is seen as crucial to the company\u2019s long-term profitability.  Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said in May that the company was on course to deliver a record number of cars in the second quarter, beating the 90,700 it sent to customers in the final quarter of last year.

BMW and Audi have yet to release annual sales data. Tesla said it delivered 245,240 vehicles in 2018.  The success of the German manufacturers is based on sales of combustion engined vehicles at a time when customers are hankering for newer electric cars with sophisticated software-based infotainment systems.  The Germans are also launching electric cars, but their profits come mainly from sales of high-horsepower diesel and petrol engined vehicles.  Mercedes-Benz posted a new sales record last year thanks to an 11 percent sales jump in China, the world\u2019s largest car market, while sales in the United States and Europe fell 6.3 percent and 2.3 percent respectively.  Its flagship S-class saloon saw sales rise 12 percent, while more than a third of customers chose to buy a sport-utility vehicle (SUV), and around 25 percent of sales were compact cars, Mercedes-Benz said.  \u201cIn 2018 Mercedes-Benz was at the top of the premium segment in the automotive industry for the third year in a row,\u201d Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche said on Tuesday.

SAN FRANCISCO, March 1 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc\u2019s sudden decision to shutter the bulk of its stores around the world raises a red flag over the future of its solar branch, a declining business it paid $2.6 billion for in a controversial 2016 deal.  Chief Executive Elon Musk\u2019s announcement on Thursday that the electric vehicle maker would close \u201cmany\u201d of its stores around the world to sell cars online-only removes the only retail outlet for solar sales since Musk pulled the plug on a partnership with Home Depot last June.  \u201cSolar is now the stepchild at Tesla. They\u2019ve made two decisions in a row that deal crippling blows to the solar business and they may be regretting the Home Depot idea,\u201d said Frank Gillett, principal analyst at Forrester Research. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel thoughtfully done, it\u2019s rushed. Basically it will hurt them from a brand and marketing point of view,\u201d Gillett said.  When Tesla made its offer for SolarCity - a debt-laden solar-panel sales and installation company founded by two of Musk\u2019s cousins - its stock price was down 70 percent from its all-time high. Musk cast the deal as a \u201cno-brainer\u201d rife with synergies, in which customers could be sold both cars and solar energy systems.  That has not yet proven to be the case, and Tesla\u2019s solar business has been shrinking as selling the Model 3 sedan became Tesla\u2019s priority. As part of company-wide layoffs last June, Tesla closed about a dozen solar installation facilities.  Tesla said all sales for its energy and solar products around the world would now be online only, too. The company says that roughly 75 percent of its current solar sales volume is generated outside of its retail stores via the web or referrals.  \u201cThe majority of our residential solar and Powerwall orders are already placed outside our retail stores, including online or via referral, and we believe this shift to online sales, paired with a dedicated energy adviser from our support team, will result in the best, most seamless customer experience in the industry,\u201d a Tesla spokesman told Reuters.  Tesla cited a cut in prices of its residential solar systems by as much as 25 percent in November, representing savings of between $3,000-$5,000 on average, helped by streamlining its sales operations, and said the shift to online sales would unlock additional cost efficiencies. [nL2N1XQ1O6  Ending the deal with Home Depot, whose stores generate high foot traffic, took a huge bite out of Tesla solar sales. In the fourth quarter, the company deployed 73 megawatts of retrofit solar systems, down 21 percent from the prior quarter and well below SolarCity\u2019s more than 200 megawatts a quarter in early 2016. Total energy generation and storage revenue fell 7 percent from the prior quarter to $371.5 million.  Besides selling private-label and third-party solar panels, Tesla sells energy storage systems for home and business use, so-called Powerwalls and Powerpacks. Tesla has said nearly all Powerwall-only orders are placed via the web or certain third-party solar installers.  Installations of the solar roof tiles unveiled by Musk in 2016 are at a \u201cslow pace,\u201d Tesla said in its 2018 annual report, due to design changes. Progress at Tesla\u2019s solar factory in Buffalo, New York, where the tiles are to be manufactured, meanwhile, has been stalled by assembly-line problems.  One former solar seller laid off in January told Reuters that 70 percent of leads on solar had come from Home Depot. Upper management at Tesla \u201cdidn\u2019t appreciate the significance\u201d of the deal with the big-box retailer, the source said.  \u201cIf you want to go mass volume, you have to go after the customers,\u201d the source said. \u201cSolar isn\u2019t sexy enough to have the customer come to you.\u201d  Musk said Tesla will still keep open a small number of stores in high-traffic locations as galleries and information centers, where details about energy products will also be offered.  When customers order a car on Tesla\u2019s website, they are alerted during the configuration process to the possibility of ordering solar or other energy products.  In January, Tesla said it was \u201cstill in the process of transitioning our sales channel from former partners to our Tesla stores and training our sales team to sell solar systems in addition to vehicles.\u201d  But former solar salespeople told Reuters that Tesla had already put solar on the back burner, with Tesla-branded panels not even available for installations in the latter half of 2018.  \u201cThey\u2019d tell us the focus of the company is the Model 3,\u201d said one former seller, who left the company in January. \u201cThe Model 3 has to be successful or there\u2019s no company.\u201d (Reporting by Alexandria Sage; Editing by Greg Mitchell and Leslie Adler)","1353":"SAN FRANCISCO, March 14 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc will unveil its Model Y electric sports utility vehicle on Thursday evening in California, promising a much-awaited crossover that will face competition from European car makers rolling out their own electric rivals.  Chief Executive Elon Musk has said the compact SUV, built on the same platform as the Model 3, which starts at $35,000, is about 10 percent bigger than the sedan, will cost about 10 percent more, and have slightly less range for the same battery.  Musk plans to unveil the car and offer pricing and other details at a small event at Tesla's design studio in Hawthorne, outside Los Angeles, and it will stream it online starting at 8 p.m. PT (11 p.m. ET). (www.tesla.com\/modely)  Small SUVs are the fastest-growing segment in both the United States and China, the world\u2019s largest auto market, where Tesla is building a factory, making the Model Y well positioned to tap demand.  Tesla has enjoyed little competition thus far for its sedans, but competition for electric SUVs is heating up as Tesla tries to master a new set of economics from the luxury line that made its reputation. On Thursday, ratings company Fitch warned that, despite Tesla\u2019s early lead, \u201cincumbent carmakers have the ability to catch up ... thanks to their capacity to invest and their robust record in product management.\u201d  Tesla\u2019s targeted volume production date of late 2020 would put it behind electric SUV offerings from Volkswagen AG\u2019s Audi, Daimler AG\u2019s Mercedes-Benz and BMW .  Shares of Tesla are down 24 percent from a year high of $379.57 in August, when Musk tweeted that he was taking Tesla private.  That plan - later scrapped - ushered in an ongoing period of turmoil at the company, from Musk\u2019s public battles with regulators, a flurry of securities lawsuits, cost cutting and layoffs across the company. Tesla two weeks ago said it would close most stores and use savings to cut the price of most cars by 6 percent. Last week Tesla reversed course and said it would leave many stores open and raised prices back by about 3 percent.  Musk has promised an easier production ramp of the Model Y, since it shares about three-quarters of its parts with the Model 3 and would need only half the capital expenditures of the sedan.  The risk is \u201cquite low\u201d Musk told analysts in January. Tesla would \u201cmost likely\u201d build the Model Y at Tesla\u2019s battery factory in Nevada, he said.  Still, the Model Y, like all Tesla\u2019s models, has already seen pre-production delays. Suppliers were originally told that production would start on the vehicle in November 2019, sources told Reuters last year.  In October, Musk said \u201csignificant progress\u201d had been made on the Model Y and that he had approved the prototype for production in 2020.

But Tesla said in a letter that it had taken steps to ensure driver engagement with the system and enhance its safety features.  The electric automaker introduced new warnings for red lights and stop signs last year \u201cto minimize the potential risk of red light- or stop sign-running as a result of temporary driver inattention,\u201d Tesla said in the letter.  Senator Edward Markey said he believed the potential dangers of Autopilot can be overcome. But he called for \u201crebranding and remarketing the system to reduce misuse, as well as building backup driver monitoring tools that will make sure no one falls asleep at the wheel.\u201d  Markey\u2019s comments came in a press release, with a copy of a Dec. 20 from Tesla addressing some of the Democratic senator\u2019s concerns attached.  Autopilot has been engaged in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016.  Crashes involving Autopilot have raised questions about the driver-assistance system\u2019s ability to detect hazards, especially stationary objects.  There are mounting safety concerns globally about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.  Markey cited videos of Tesla drivers who appeared to fall asleep behind the wheel while using Autopilot, and others in which drivers said they could defeat safeguards by sticking a banana or water bottle in the steering wheel to make it appear they were in control of the vehicle.  Tesla, in its letter, said its revisions to steering wheel monitoring meant that in most situations \u201ca limp hand on the wheel from a sleepy driver will not work, nor will the coarse hand pressure of a person with impaired motor controls, such as a drunk driver.\u201d  It added that devices \u201cmarketed to trick Autopilot, may be able to trick the system for a short time, but generally not for an entire trip before Autopilot disengages.\u201d  Tesla also wrote that while videos like those cited by Markey showed \u201ca few bad actors who are grossly abusing Autopilot\u201d they represented only \u201ca very small percentage of our customer base.\u201d  Earlier this month, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it was launching an investigation into a 14th crash involving Tesla in which it suspects Autopilot or other advanced driver assistance system was in use.  NHTSA is probing a Dec. 29 fatal crash of a Model S Tesla in Gardena, California. In that incident, the vehicle exited the 91 Freeway, ran a red light and struck a 2006 Honda Civic, killing its two occupants.

The starting prices for five different versions of China-made Model 3s range from 328,000 to 522,000 yuan. Customers can expect to receive the car in 6-10 months, the company said in a press release.  It also said buyers will only need to put down a deposit of 20,000 yuan and that financing options on offer meant that monthly payment instalments will start from 1,100 yuan.  \u201cThe price drop is to make Tesla more accessible,\u201d it said.

CRUCIAL PRODUCTION  Doubts about the Model 3\u2019s production rate and sales performance have hit Tesla\u2019s share price in recent months.  Producing cars locally is likely to help Tesla minimize the impact of Sino-U.S. tit-for-tat import tariffs, which has forced the EV maker to adjust prices of its U.S.-made cars in China.  Keeping prices in check will also help Tesla fend off competition from a swathe of domestic EV startups such as Nio Inc, Weltmeister and XPeng Motors, as well as established carmakers including Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co.

An independent assessment proved that a base version of the Model S was available for less than the 60,000 euros ($74,000) baseline and the cars are thus eligible, the German Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Controls (BAFA) told Reuters.  Germany in 2016 launched the incentive scheme worth about 1 billion euros and partly financed by the German car industry to boost electric car usage but it includes a baseline to exempt premium models.  BAFA unexpectedly took Tesla\u2019s vehicles off the list in December, saying customers could not order the Model S base version without extra features that pushed the car above the price limit.  Tesla denied at the time that the no-frills version was not available and said on Thursday a model was always available below the cut-off price.  BAFA said it was nonetheless reviewing previously approved applications for subsidies, which could mean that buyers may be asked to repay subsidies they have already received.  BAFA has received a total of 1,275 applications for subsidies of Tesla purchases, according to its website.

FILE PHOTO: Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk speaks onstage during a delivery event for Tesla China-made Model 3 cars at its factory in Shanghai, China January 7, 2020. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  Just when his electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla seemed to be pivoting away from using cobalt in its batteries, it signs a long-term supply deal for the controversial metal with Glencore.  This from the man who has vowed to eliminate cobalt from the Tesla product mix because of its financial cost and the reputational cost of a metal associated with child labour and poor safety conditions at artisanal mining operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the world\u2019s dominant producer.  Tesla\u2019s not the first auto company to lock in future cobalt supplies with a miner. BMW did the same last year, also with Glencore as well as with the Bou-Azzer mine in Morocco.  But Tesla is the standard-bearer for the EV revolution and its deal with Glencore has strategic significance for the global battery raw materials supply chain.  It\u2019s a boost for cobalt\u2019s prospects, both in terms of physical demand and, more importantly, in the apparent admission that cobalt isn\u2019t going away as a battery material any time soon.  It\u2019s also a warning to other auto companies that if they want cobalt, they\u2019re going to have to take control over their own supply chain.  BATTERY CHOICE  Tesla and its battery partner Panasonic have until now largely used a nickel-cobalt-aluminium (NCA) formula in their lithium-ion batteries.  Other automotive companies targeting the passenger vehicle market have adopted nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) technology.  Everyone has been trying to reduce the amount of cobalt in the metallic mix. Cobalt is expensive, currently trading around $33,000 per tonne on the London Metal Exchange. It has a history of volatility both in terms of price and supply, which is dominated by production, both official-sector and artisanal, in the Congo.  The human cost of artisanal mining also weighs heavy on an industry that is driving towards a green and socially responsible future.  Tesla\u2019s desire to shift away from cobalt usage seemed to be borne out by the revelation its new Chinese plant would use cobalt-free batteries.  Lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries have been around a long time, are cheaper than cobalt-containing batteries, but lack energy density. The biggest market is China, where they are used in vehicles that don\u2019t need extensive range or high performance, such as municipal garbage trucks.  However, it seems that Chinese LFP battery makers such as Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) have been quietly improving the technology to the point that Tesla is now interested in using it in its Model 3 cars in China.  But it\u2019s also clear from the Glencore deal that Tesla, however reluctantly, is going to continue using cobalt in other markets.  Tesla\u2019s willingness to consider a range of battery types is testament that the EV revolution is going to be characterised by multiple chemistries depending on vehicle type and geographic market.  And some of them at least are going to use cobalt.  GRAPHIC: Tesla's reluctant commitment to cobalt a warning to others -  COBALT BLUES  Tesla\u2019s deal to buy 6,000 tonnes per year of cobalt from Glencore\u2019s Congo operations is a double boost for the market, representing a long-term affirmation of demand and a short-term way of clearing excess stocks.  The cobalt market has yet to recover from the crash that followed the price boom of 2017-2018 as too much supply, particularly from the Congo\u2019s artisanal sector, swamped demand.  Glencore last year placed its Mutanda mine in the Congo on two-year care and maintenance, while its Katanga mine was carrying stocks of almost 13,000 tonnes at the end of 2019.  Those stocks have weighed heavily on the price. Fastmarkets\u2019 assessment of standard-grade cobalt currently sits at an 11-month low of $14.75 per kilogram ($30,250 per tonne)  However, Glencore has recently concluded a flurry of supply deals with battery-makers and now with Tesla, signalling the company \u201chas placed a strategic focus on forward selling its built-up hydroxide stocks,\u201d according to analysts at Roskill.  The research house estimates that Glencore has now locked in sales representing around 82% of production at Katanga. That, combined with Mutanda on care and maintenance, \u201csignificantly reduces the volumes of cobalt available in the open market\u201d.  That may translate into an accelerated price recovery when the next EV-led demand surge happens.  It also means there\u2019s potentially less around for everyone else. There are several new cobalt mines in the planning or development stage but the Congo and its artisanal miners are going to remain the dominant supplier for the foreseeable future.  That simple fact explains why Tesla has moved directly to ensure its own supply with the largest non-Chinese producer in the country.  Other automotive makers may well take heed.  SUPPLY SECURITY  Tesla\u2019s move directly to take responsibility for its cobalt supply isn\u2019t without risk.  Glencore may be a London-listed multinational, but it\u2019s not immune to the negative headlines that go with doing business in the Congo.  It is under intense regulatory scrutiny; the Swiss Attorney General\u2019s Office (OAG) last week joining the list of ongoing investigations into its conduct in the country.  Last year saw the death of 43 \u201cillegal\u201d miners on Glencore\u2019s Kamoto concession, a human tragedy that was compounded by the government\u2019s decision to send in the army to forcibly clear the area.  Tesla, though, has evidently decided the risk of not getting enough future cobalt outweighs the potential reputational risks of taking supply directly from the Congo.  Such direct mine sourcing is not the norm for auto companies. They don\u2019t, for example, directly buy the iron ore that goes into the steel they use. Or the bauxite that makes the aluminium.  But cobalt is different. There\u2019s not much around and too much of what is around comes from the Congo.  The EV revolution may have been stalled by COVID-19, but the build-out of battery manufacturing capacity has continued uninterrupted.  And with the European Union in particular focusing its industrial stimulus package on \u201cgreen\u201d technology, the next EV wave may already be building.  Tesla\u2019s reluctant commitment to cobalt is a warning sign for other automakers they may have to do the same if they want to be sure they\u2019ve got enough of the stuff to meet that coming demand surge.

Now the Tesla Inc TSLA.O CEO is looking to reengineer how a company can be taken private.  FILE PHOTO: Elon Musk, founder, CEO and lead designer at SpaceX and co-founder of Tesla, speaks at the International Space Station Research and Development Conference in Washington, U.S., July 19, 2017. REUTERS\/Aaron P. Bernstein\/File Photo  Musk announced on Twitter on Tuesday that he was considering taking Tesla private for $420 per share, or $72 billion, in what would be the biggest deal of this kind. He said the funding for the deal was secured, but did not provide details.  Tesla shares ended up 11 percent at $379.57, indicating investors gave some credence to the plan.  But investment bankers and analysts reacted with skepticism, telling Reuters it would be hard for Musk, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $22 billion, to raise the equity and debt financing needed for the deal given Tesla is not turning a profit.  \u201cThe company is cash-flow negative. How do you use any debt on a company that is cash-flow negative?\u201d said Steven Kaplan, a University of Chicago professor who researches private equity.  Finding equity partners and bank financing is key to take-private deals. When Michael Dell took his eponymous computer maker private for $24.9 billion in 2013, for example, he brought in buyout firm Silver Lake that contributed $1.4 billion in equity, raised more than $10 billion in bank debt, and received a $2 billion loan from Microsoft Corp MSFT.O.  When a Twitter user commented on Musk\u2019s proposed deal by posting \u201cJust like Dell did. It saves a lot of headaches\u201d, Musk responded by tweeting \u201cYes\u201d.  Dell\u2019s take-private deal, however, may not be possible to replicate with Tesla, which has a $10.9 billion debt pile, is losing money, and whose bonds are rated junk by credit ratings agencies. Without the ability to add more debt, Musk may have to turn to sources of capital that are less accustomed to using debt to juice returns in the way private equity firms are.  SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS  One option could be sovereign wealth funds, investment bankers said.  Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF) has taken a stake of less than 5 percent in Tesla, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. PIF did not respond to a request for comment on whether it would bankroll Musk\u2019s take-private deal.  SoftBank Group Corp's 9984.T $93 billion Vision Fund, whose investors include the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, is seen as an obvious partner given its appetite for big technology investments, but was not contacted by Musk and is not interested in a deal given its investment in Tesla competitor Cruise, the self-driving car unit of General Motors Co GM.N, according to a source familiar with the matter. SoftBank declined to comment.  China's Tencent Holdings 0700.HK, which took a 5 percent stake in Tesla last year, is another possible partner.  However foreign capital sources would be subject to scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews deals for potential national security risks. Any proposal for funding from Chinese firms could face even tougher checks amid mounting U.S.-China trade tensions.  Many attempts by founders and top executives to take their companies private have never come to fruition. In March, Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O Chairman Paul Jacobs stepped down from the board to pursue a long-shot take-private bid for the U.S. chip maker, which has a market capitalization of $93 billion. To date, this bid has not materialized.  U.S. department store operator Nordstrom Inc's JWN.N attempt to go private also failed earlier this year, after banks balked at providing the necessary financing to the founding family members seeking to put together the deal.  SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLE  Musk has said he would be looking to keep his ownership of Tesla at around 20 percent and that a special purpose vehicle, like the one that exists at his aerospace company SpaceX, would allow Tesla shareholders to remain invested if they so choose, and then cash out when they wanted.  But sources familiar with SpaceX told Reuters it is not clear how Musk would apply it to Tesla. Fidelity Investments, the major backer of SpaceX, did not invest in it through a special purpose vehicle, according to the sources.  Fidelity declined to comment, while SpaceX and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  SpaceX only has a limited number of shareholders, who often choose to sell on their shares in the private market.  By contrast, allowing thousands of Tesla shareholders to remain invested through a special purpose vehicle would essentially mean that shares in that new vehicle are publicly traded in some way.  Even if such a deal was cobbled together, it is not clear whether so-called \u201cliquidity events\u201d, that Musk said he organizes at SpaceX every six months, would be sufficient for all existing Tesla investors to cash out.  \u201cTo have a deal of this size, that\u2019d be unprecedented as far as I can remember,\u201d Kaplan said.","1366":"FILE PHOTO: SpaceX owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk arrives on the red carpet for the automobile awards \"Das Goldene Lenkrad\" (The golden steering wheel) given by a German newspaper in Berlin, Germany, November 12, 2019.

Analysts from the U.S. bank had upped its forecast from $198 to $308 after a roughly $100 surge in Tesla stock following Musk\u2019s tweets on Aug. 7 and the note on Monday was the latest evidence of scepticism about the deal on Wall Street.  People familiar with the matter said on Sunday that PIF, the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund that Musk says had been pressing to help fund the buyout, is in talks to invest in aspiring Tesla rival Lucid Motors Inc.  \u201cOur interpretation of subsequent events leads us to believe that funding was not secured for a going private transaction, nor was there any formal proposal,\u201d JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a client note.  \u201cTesla does appear to be exploring a going private transaction, but we now believe that such a process appears much less developed than we had earlier presumed, suggesting formal incorporation into our valuation analysis seems premature at this time,\u201d Brinkman said.  JPM now targets the stock, which it continues to value at underweight, back at $195, versus Friday\u2019s close of $305.50. The median price target of the Wall Street analysts covering Tesla is $336.  Tesla shares touched a three-month low of $285 in premarket trading before recovering to trade around $290, reducing its market value back below that of General Motors GM.N as the biggest U.S. carmaker.

The Tempus International Fund and the Opportunity Unique Fund, which are both managed by Brazil\u2019s Opportunity Gest\u00e3o de Investimentos e Recursos Ltda, were among more than a dozen Tesla investors to file motions Tuesday night in federal court in San Francisco, where U.S. District Judge Edward Chen is overseeing lawsuits alleging that Tesla CEO Elon Musk deceived shareholders when he tweeted on Aug. 7 that he had secured funding to take the company private at $420 per share.  Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.  As Tesla shares spiked following Musk\u2019s tweet, Tempus bought more than 150,000 shares and OUF bought more than 11,000 to cover short positions. The two funds, which are represented by the shareholders\u2019 firm Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer, claim to have lost more money in their Tesla purchases than any of the other hedge funds and individual investors bidding to lead the litigation against Tesla.  Tesla short-sellers Andrew Left and Vilas Capital also asked Judge Chen to appoint them as lead shareholders in the investor case, which will proceed as a class action on behalf of all Tesla shareholders. Left and Vilas are part of an investor group claiming losses of more than $4.5 million. That group, which is represented by Labaton Sucharow and Keller Lenkner, also includes investors who held long positions in Tesla but lost money as the shares spiked on Musk\u2019s tweet and declined as doubt set in about the going-private transaction.  Tesla is represented in the private securities litigation by Fenwick & West. Fenwick partner Dean Kristy did not respond to an email requesting comment on the lead shareholder candidates. Tesla and Musk neither admitted nor denied liability in their settlement with the SEC. The company will almost certainly argue that investors cannot prove Musk intended to deceive them in his Aug. 7 tweets and that he had a reasonable basis to believe he was being truthful.  The law governing private shareholder litigation in the U.S. instructs federal judges to give heavy weight to the magnitude of investors\u2019 losses when selecting a lead investor to run the class action. Congress reasoned that investors with a big stake in the outcome of the case are best positioned to make decisions on behalf of all shareholders.  Securities fraud class actions seek damages on behalf of all investors, but lead shareholders and their lawyers frame the case, decide when and whether to settle investors\u2019 claims and shape the ultimate allocation of damages. For shareholders\u2019 lawyers, appointment to serve as lead counsel means the chance to earn big fees if the case settles.  Lawyers say the lead investor in the Tesla case will have a particularly important role because many nontraditional investors such as short-sellers and options traders held positions in the company. The lead shareholder and its lawyers must represent the interests of those different constituencies if Tesla eventually agrees to a settlement.  Hedge funds have been reluctant, historically, to lead shareholder class actions. But plaintiffs' lawyers told me earlier this month, after Tesla and Musk reached a $40 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, that the SEC deal might force funds off of the fence.  \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to be an instigator,\u201d Travis Lenkner of Keller Lenkner said at the time. \u201cThere\u2019s a different public profile if you\u2019re acting after a government regulator has already said there\u2019s misconduct and reached a settlement.\u201d  In addition to the offshore funds that lost more than $15 million and the funds in the Andrew Left group, FNY Investment Advisers and Hong Kong\u2019s Bridgestone Investment Corporation also asked Judge Chen to appoint them to lead the case. FNY did not specify its losses in Tesla shares. Bridgestone claimed losses of $3.9 million. Individual Tesla investors and investor groups with losses ranging from about $330,000 to $3.5 million also submitted motions to be appointed lead.  Tempus International and OUF are the presumptive favorites to lead the Tesla case because of their big alleged losses. But other candidates will now have an opportunity to oppose the funds\u2019 motion. Such challenges could focus on the funds\u2019 methodology for calculating their losses or their ability to represent the interests of all Tesla investors.  Judges overseeing securities class actions are sometimes reluctant to appoint groups of investors as lead shareholders because of concerns that the groups have been assembled by lawyers. The Left\/Vilas group tried to dampen those concerns in a joint declaration from the members of the group. The investors said they and their lawyers came up with the idea of banding together.  \u201cBased upon our own diligence and communications, we agreed that a small group of sophisticated investors, covering long, short, equity, and options positions, together, represented the best possible structure to achieve the maximum results in this litigation for ourselves and similarly situated investors,\u201d the declaration said.","1372":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Tesla Inc boss Elon Musk emerged victorious on Friday from a closely watched defamation trial as a federal court jury swiftly rejected the $190 million claim brought against him by a British cave explorer who Musk had branded a \u201cpedo guy\u201d on Twitter.  The unanimous verdict by a panel of five women and three men was returned after roughly 45 minutes of deliberation on the fourth day of Musk\u2019s trial. Legal experts believe it was the first major defamation lawsuit brought by a private individual over remarks on Twitter to be decided by a jury.  The outcome was a triumph for Musk, whose mercurial behavior in a number of instances last year came under close scrutiny from federal regulators and shareholders of Tesla, his Silicon Valley-based electric car manufacturer.  The jury\u2019s decision signals a higher legal threshold for challenging potentially libelous Twitter comments, said L. Lin Wood, the high-profile trial lawyer who led the legal team for the plaintiff, Vernon Unsworth.  \u201cThis verdict puts everyone\u2019s reputation at risk,\u201d Wood told reporters after the verdict was announced.  Other lawyers specializing in defamation agreed the verdict reflects how the freewheeling nature of social media has altered understandings of what distinguishes libel punishable in court from casual rhetoric and hyperbole protected as free speech.  Musk, 48, who had testified during the first two days of the trial in his own defense and returned to court on Friday to hear closing arguments, exited the courtroom after the verdict and said: \u201cMy faith in humanity is restored.\u201d  \u2018TAKE IT ON THE CHIN\u2019  Outside the courthouse, Unsworth, 64, said he was resigned to his defeat. \u201cI accept the jury\u2019s verdict, take it on the chin and get on with my life.\u201d  Wood said his client went \u201ctoe to toe with a billionaire bully,\u201d echoing a phrase from his summation earlier in court, and indicated to reporters that an appeal was doubtful.  \u201cIt\u2019s not the verdict we wanted. But it\u2019s the end of the road and we now close this chapter,\u201d Wood said.  He said he nevertheless saw the lawsuit as meaningful in helping erase the stain he said Unsworth\u2019s reputation suffered.  During the course of the trial, Musk testified under oath that his use of the term \u201cpedo guy\u201d - slang for pedophile - was never meant to be taken literally, and he apologized to Unsworth for the comment from the witness stand.  Slideshow ( 10 images )  The case stems from a public quarrel between Musk and Unsworth, a British diver who lives part-time in Thailand and gained fame for his leading role in coordinating the successful rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave in that country in July 2018.  Unsworth had chided Musk in a CNN interview for delivering a mini-submarine, which was never used, to the site of the Tham Luang Nang Non cave system. Unsworth called Musk\u2019s intervention a \u201cP.R.\u201d stunt and said the high-tech entrepreneur should \u201cstick his submarine where it hurts.\u201d  Slideshow ( 10 images )  THREE TWEETS  Musk responded two days later on Twitter with three posts that became the basis of the defamation case. The first questioned Unsworth\u2019s role in the rescue, while the second said, \u201cSorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.\u201d  The third tweet, in reply to a follower who asked Musk about the second tweet, said, \u201cBet ya a signed dollar it\u2019s true.\u201d  Wood said during his summation that Musk\u2019s tweets were akin to a \u201cnuclear bomb\u201d that would overshadow Unsworth\u2019s relationships and job prospects for years to come and urged jurors to teach the Tesla chief executive and SpaceX founder a lesson by awarding Unsworth $190 million, including $150 million in punitive damages.  Two days earlier, under questioning on the witness stand, Musk had estimated his net worth at $20 billion.  But the jury was apparently swayed by the arguments put forth by Musk\u2019s attorney, Alex Spiro, who said the tweets in question amounted to an off-hand insult in the midst of an argument, which no one could be expected to take seriously.  \u201cIn arguments you insult people,\u201d he said. \u201cNo bomb went off.\u201d  The defense also said Unsworth failed to demonstrate any harm from the Twitter comments and even tried to profit from his role in the rescue, which won him plaudits from the Thai and British governments.  U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson had said the case hinged on whether a reasonable person would take Musk\u2019s Twitter statements to mean he was actually calling Unsworth a pedophile.  To win, Unsworth needed to show that Musk was negligent in publishing a falsehood that clearly identified the plaintiff and caused him harm. \u201cActual malice\u201d on Musk\u2019s part, a high standard in defamation cases, did not need to be proven since the judge deemed Unsworth a private individual, not a public figure.  The trial revived discussion of Musk\u2019s erratic behavior in 2018, when he used Twitter to float a leveraged buyout proposal for Tesla that was scuttled, ultimately paying $20 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission complaint.  For most of 2019, Musk, who has nearly 30 million Twitter followers, has largely kept his public comments focused on Tesla\u2019s new models and improved profitability and on the technical progress of his aerospace company, SpaceX.","1373":"April 26 (Reuters) -  * SHORT-SELLER JIM CHANOS SAYS HAS BEEN SHORT ON TESLA FOR FOUR YEARS - CNBC  * SHORT-SELLER JIM CHANOS SAYS TESLA LAGGING BEHIND AND NO LONGER A LEADER IN AUTO PILOT- CNBC  * KYNIKOS\u2019 JIM CHANOS SAYS HE THINKS ELON MUSK WILL LEAVE TESLA AS CEO AND MOVE TO SPACEX IN THE FUTURE - CNBC  * SHORT-SELLER JIM CHANOS SAYS IS SHORT ON DUNKIN- CNBC  * KYNIKOS\u2019 JIM CHANOS SAYS HE IS SHORT RESTAURANT BRANDS INTERNATIONAL INC - CNBC  * JIM CHANOS SAYS HAS BEEN SHORT RESTAURANT BRANDS INTERNATIONAL AND DUNKIN\u2019 BRANDS GROUP FOR ABOUT A YEAR - CNBC  * JIM CHANOS SAYS HAS NO POSITION ON STARBUCKS - CNBC Further company coverage:","1374":"(Reuters) - Bitcoin took another large stride toward mainstream acceptance on Monday after billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s electric vehicle company Tesla Inc revealed it had bought $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency and would soon accept it as a form of payment for cars, sending the cryptocurrency shooting higher.

Musk has upended Wall Street over the last year and briefly became the world\u2019s richest person as shares of Tesla surged nearly 500% to become the fifth most-valuable U.S. company, leaving other companies and investors eager to follow in his wake.  \u201cIf any lesser mortals had made the decision to put part of their balance sheet in Bitcoin, I don\u2019t think it would have been taken seriously,\u201d said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC in New York. \u201cBut when the richest man in the world does it, everyone has to take a second look.\u201d  The news sparked heavy trading in cryptocurrencies and caused exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini, Binance to experience technical issues, according to Coindesk here.  It also generated discussion on Reddit. While discussions of cryptocurrencies are banned on the WallStreetBets community that fueled the GameStop Corp trading frenzy, users in other subreddits posted \u201cto the moon,\u201d expecting more companies to follow suit after Tesla.  A well-known supporter of cryptocurrencies, Musk has weighed in regularly on the past month\u2019s frenzy in retail investment, also driving up prices of the meme-based digital currency dogecoin and shares of U.S. video game chain GameStop.  Experts said they would not be surprised by a closer look from regulators given Musk\u2019s bumpy past with watchdogs.  The Securities and Exchange Commission sparred with Musk and Tesla several times over his use of Twitter to discuss the company, ultimately resulting in his exit as company chairman and a pair of $20 million fines for Musk and Tesla.  \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a billionaire with one of the most valuable companies in the history of the world who has seemingly gotten away with poking the SEC before,\u201d said Tyler Gellasch, head of the Washington-based Healthy Markets Association and former SEC official. Still, Gellasch said that \u201cexamination doesn\u2019t mean this is likely to be an enforcement case.\u201d  Tesla said in a filing the decision to move nearly 8% of its reserves into bitcoin was part of its broad investment policy as a company aimed at diversifying and maximizing its returns on cash, including holding gold. The report said it ended 2020 with $19.38 billion in cash and cash equivalents.  \u201cWe expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt,\u201d the company said.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Tesla said it had invested an aggregate $1.5 billion in bitcoin under the changed policy and could \"acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term\". (bit.ly\/3q53p1m) Shares of the company rose 1.3% Monday.  Gold jumped more than 1% Monday while ethereum, another cryptocurrency, surged to a record high.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  LONG-TERM STORE OF VALUE?  Central banks remain skeptical of digital currencies, but analysts say the more real world uses appear for bitcoin, the more attractive it will prove as a long-term store of value.  Bitcoin has rallied as far as $47,565 after Tesla\u2019s disclosure. The cryptocurrency is up 1135% since March 2020, thanks in part to interest from institutional investors.  \u201cThe argument for bitcoin is evolving. It used to be negative (reasons to buy), but suddenly there are positive reasons, and that\u2019s why you see bitcoin at (new highs),\u201d Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor of Allianz, told CNBC.  Tesla is the latest company to add bitcoin to its corporate treasury, following similar moves by Square, the payments company led by Twitter Inc chief Jack Dorsey and U.S. software firm MicroStrategy Inc.  Apple Inc may be the next big company to enter the cryptocurrency market, both by allowing bitcoin to be exchanged on its Apple Wallet service and investing some of its own reserves in units of the cryptocurrency, said Mitch Steves, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.  \u201cIf this becomes a trend in corporate treasuries the downside of staying on the sidelines will only become costlier over time,\u201d said Maya Zehavi, a blockchain consultant.  (GRAPHIC-Bitcoin hits record high on Tesla investment: )  Tesla\u2019s move to put some of its corporate reserves in bitcoin may be a signal that it expects the cryptocurrency will emerge as another store of long-term value alongside the dollar and gold, said Graham Tanaka, president and chief investment officer of Tanaka Capital Management in New York.  \u201cCompanies are very careful when it comes down to their reserves,\u201d he said. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t appear to be a flash in the pan.

Gigafactory 2, which is also known as RiverBend, a joint venture with Panasonic to produce solar panels and roof tiles in Buffalo, New York, U.S., August 2, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tesla is back on the road, with its battery charged at least one-quarter full. The delayed ramp-up of its Model 3 revved up the electric-car maker\u2019s latest sales and drove it into the black in the three months to September.  Chief Executive Elon Musk has long promised that the mass-market sedan would transform the $50 billion Tesla from a loss-making producer of innovative luxury vehicles to an industry titan for the 21st century. After numerous fits and starts, the past quarter offered a glimpse of that vision.  Overall revenue more than doubled to $6.8 billion, nearly half generated by the Model 3, and the company ended its string of losses by turning a profit of $312 million in the period, according to Wednesday\u2019s release. It also managed to give itself a little financial breathing room, ending the period with nearly $3 billion in cash, up more than a third from the end of June.  Musk can even claim victory over at least one short-seller, with Citron Research turning bullish on the stock on Tuesday, calling the Model 3 a \u201cproven hit.\u201d Tesla\u2019s stock popped more than 10 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday.  The turnaround couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. The pressure of efforts to increase volume earlier this year coincided with increasingly erratic behavior from Musk, who in July launched Twitter taunts at a cave diver in Thailand and the following month roiled markets by saying he planned to take the company private with \u201cfunding secured.\u201d The latter brought charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which Musk settled last month, agreeing to pay $20 million and cede the chairmanship of Tesla\u2019s board to an independent candidate.  It\u2019s far from clear that Tesla\u2019s newfound profitability is sustainable. Model 3 production averaged 4,300 a week in the quarter, missing Musk\u2019s target of 5,000 and well short of his 2019 goal of 7,000. The company may be vulnerable to growing competition from the likes of BMW, and Consumer Reports on Wednesday said Tesla had dropped further down its latest annual auto reliability survey. It\u2019s still possible Tesla could need to raise capital, and Musk can be his own worst enemy.  Still, after a riotously unstable quarter seen from the outside, any hint of things inside Tesla settling down to normalcy is welcome.","1379":"FILE PHOTO: A Tesla Model S steering wheel is on display at the Canadian International AutoShow in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, February 13, 2019.

Should be solved shortly.\u201d  The 47-year-old billionaire, who earlier this month faced investor ire over smoking marijuana on a live web show, has indicated in the past that Tesla\u2019s customers may face a longer response time because of a significant increase in vehicle delivery volume in North America.  Tesla\u2019s ability to deliver on production targets has weighed on its stock in the past, and the company has been working to iron out bumps after failing to meet production targets for its Model 3 sedans.  The company has eliminated some color options for its cars to streamline operations to ramp up production.  Musk also tweeted on Sunday that Tesla would bring most collision repairs in-house, saying owners were experiencing excessive wait times at body shops.

(Reuters) - Directors of Tesla Inc settled a shareholder lawsuit over the company\u2019s 2016 acquisition of SolarCity Corp, leaving Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk as the lone defendant facing claims that Tesla paid $2.6 billion for a worthless solar energy system installer, according to court documents.  FILE PHOTO: Elon Musk, Chairman of SolarCity and CEO of Tesla Motors, speaks at SolarCity's Inside Energy Summit in Manhattan, New York October 2, 2015. REUTERS\/Rashid Umar Abbasi\/File Photo  The $60 million settlement comes as a 10-day trial is scheduled to start on March 16 in Delaware in which shareholders seek $2.6 billion in damages, the entire cost of the SolarCity deal.  A lawyer for Musk and a spokesman for Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Tesla shareholders have alleged Musk breached his fiduciary duties, squandered Tesla\u2019s assets and unjustly enriched himself by pushing to buy the money-losing solar company in which he was the biggest investor.  The settlement covered five current directors: Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio Gracias, Stephen Jurvetson and Kimbal Musk. Brad Buss, who was a director at the time of the SolarCity deal, was also part of the settlement, which was paid from insurance policies, according to court documents.  \u201cPlaintiffs probably think they have a cleaner shot on the merits if the only issues they have to raise are with Elon Musk and Elon Musk\u2019s actions,\u201d said Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School.  The case was brought in the Court of Chancery in Delaware, where Tesla is incorporated, by an individual investor and five investment funds.  Tesla said in a statement to Reuters in September the allegations were \u201cbased on the claims of plaintiff\u2019s lawyers looking for a payday, and are not representative of our shareholders.\u201d  The suit represents another legal headache for Musk, who in the past two years has settled a lawsuit by securities regulators over his use of Twitter and won a defamation trial brought by a British cave explorer.  Musk and the Tesla board also are scheduled to defend Musk\u2019s pay package at a trial in Delaware next year.  At the heart of the current case are allegations that Musk and the other board members did not fully disclose the depth of SolarCity\u2019s problems, or their own conflicts.  SolarCity was founded in 2006 by Musk and his cousins, Lyndon Rive and Peter Rive, who were the company\u2019s CEO and chief technology officer as well as directors. Musk was SolarCity\u2019s chairman and largest shareholder, and five of Tesla\u2019s directors were direct or indirect owners of SolarCity stock.  Entering 2016, SolarCity\u2019s stock was on a sharp downward trajectory and the company was slashing its workforce and bleeding cash.  Tesla touted synergies of combining the companies in the all-stock deal, which was approved by Tesla shareholders.  After the deal closed, Tesla slashed its solar sales force and ended a solar marketing deal with Home Depot Inc. Quarterly solar installations plummeted and are well below levels SolarCity enjoyed in its heyday.  Tesla has said Musk\u2019s involvement in deal discussions and all other material information were accurately described to shareholders in public filings before the deal closed.  On Wednesday, Tesla reported its second straight quarterly profit, sending its stock surging to an all-time high.","1384":"Sept 23 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc faced a stock market reality check on Wednesday after a much hyped \u201cBattery Day\u201d event which Wall Street analysts judged chiefly for its omissions and hazy delivery deadlines.  Investors had expected two big announcements from Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk: the development of a \u201cmillion mile\u201d battery good for 10 years or more, and a specific cost reduction target - expressed in dollars per kilowatt-hour - that would finally drop the price of an electric vehicle below that of a gasoline car.  They got neither from the event and analysts from Swiss banking group UBS said the innovations he did unveil and the promise to deliver a sub-$25,000 mass market model within three years also came with risks attached.  \u201cBy the time (the car) arrives, there will be significant competition in the segment, from VW group, amongst others,\u201d the bank\u2019s analysts wrote in a note to clients.  \u201cThe market is (also) likely to take it negatively that it will take at least another year to see (some of) these (battery) innovations in a real product.\u201d  Shares of the electric carmaker were down 5.1% at $402.60 in pre-market trading and on course to erase $20 billion from its last closing price on Tuesday.  At $305, the average target price among the 33 brokerages who follow the company is another $100 lower and several brokerages emphasized that expectations for what the company could deliver were already out of whack with reality as the global economy heads into a potentially long-lasting recession.  Morgan Stanley said Musk had shown substantial progress, but also laid bare the scale of the task in front of the company.  \u201cElon can\u2019t do it alone ...

Chen, who heads the city\u2019s economic and information technology commission, did not provide any further details.  The U.S. electric carmaker broke ground on the Shanghai factory in January and its CEO Elon Musk has said the firm aims to finish initial construction this summer and start production of the Model 3 toward the end of the year.  A full-fledged auto assembly factory can take about two years to build but the Shanghai government has thrown its support behind the Tesla project, which would be China\u2019s first wholly foreign-owned car plant and a reflection of the government\u2019s broader shift to open up its car market.  Tesla has been pushing forward its plans for the 500,000-vehicle-capacity plant after it secured a site in October, hiring staff, starting procurement for building materials and setting up a local financial leasing company.  Producing cars locally is also likely to help Tesla minimize the impact of the Sino-U.S. trade war, which has forced the car maker to lower prices of its U.S.-made cars in China - which has becoming increasingly important as the company seeks to offset softening demand in the United States.  On Tuesday, Tesla\u2019s shares fell more than 5 percent in early trade after Chinese media reported Shanghai customs had suspended clearance for a batch of Tesla\u2019s cars.  The company said that authorities have accepted its plan to resolve the clearance problem.  Chinese customs confirmed in a statement on its official WeChat account on Wednesday that it had stopped the Tesla Model 3 imports and was now monitoring the firm\u2019 rectifications.  It said the Model 3 cars were stopped because they did not have Chinese language-warning signs and had missing or incorrect nameplate labels. It added, however, that the nameplates could be replaced at the port.","1386":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk indicated in a tweet on Sunday that the electric carmaker received 200,000 orders for its electric pickup truck within three days of its launch.  Musk, who has been regularly tweeting about the Cybertruck\u2019s features since its launch late Thursday, has also been updating his followers with the number of orders the company has received.  In an earlier tweet, Musk said the company had received 146,000 orders for Cybertruck, and tweeted again on Sunday saying \u201c200K\u201d - an apparent reference to the number of orders.

The electric vehicle maker\u2019s unconventional CEO has shown two sides in recent court proceedings -- one polite and respectful, the other evasive and taunting.  It remains to be seen which Musk will show up on Monday at a Delaware court, the nation\u2019s leader on corporate issues, when he squares off against union pension funds and asset managers who claim they were misled about the benefits of Tesla buying SolarCity in 2016 for $2.2 billion.  Getting it wrong could cost Musk more than $1 billion.  \u201cIf you seem arrogant in court, you may be signing your own economic death warrant,\u201d said John Coffee, a securities professor at Columbia Law School.  This may be particularly true in Delaware\u2019s Court of Chancery, with roots in medieval England and known for its decorum.  Musk and his lawyers did not respond to a request for comment.  Smashing corporate norms has come to define Musk, who has a cult-like following for his ambitious vision, battles with short-sellers and disdain for \u201cboring bonehead questions\u201d from analysts.  In the Delaware case, shareholders claim SolarCity, a rooftop solar energy company, was secretly on the brink of bankruptcy when Tesla purchased it. They argue the deal benefited Musk, SolarCity\u2019s largest shareholder, his cousins who co-founded the firm, and Tesla directors who owned stakes in SolarCity.  Investors want Musk to surrender the 2.2 million shares of Tesla he received in the deal, which on Thursday were worth about $1.2 billion.  Musk has countered that Tesla\u2019s stock has tripled since the deal, demonstrating its value. SolarCity has withered because its staff were redirected toward launching the Model 3 sedan, a make-or-break product for Tesla, not because the solar business lacked value, according to Musk.  The Tesla directors who approved the deal settled allegations against themselves in January for $60 million, which was paid from insurance. They denied wrongdoing.  Musk has dug in his heels.  During a June deposition, Musk clashed with shareholder lawyer Randy Baron, calling him \u201creprehensible,\u201d doubting his emotional well-being and avoiding many questions.  He went on tangents about Tesla\u2019s solar potential, lamented both the decline of U.S. manufacturing and the large size of the legal industry and asked Baron if he was only motivated by money. Baron declined to comment.  In contrast, at a defamation trial in December, Musk donned a dark suit, spoke softly on the witness stand, and apologized to the cave rescuer who sued Musk for calling him a \u201cpedo guy\u201d on Twitter.  Musk portrayed himself as overworked, hounded by critics and earnest in his desire to help in the rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave in Thailand.  The strategy appeared to pay off when a jury ruled in Musk\u2019s favor and rejected the $190 million claim against him.  The SolarCity case will be decided by Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights.  The court has its own cult-like following for its scholarly opinions that often run more than 100 pages and which have shaped Corporate America.  \u201cThe big question is when you get an institution like him and an institution like the Court of Chancery, is it oil and water or is it mutual respect?\u201d said Larry Hamermesh, a professor at Delaware Law School.  Executives often struggle with testimony because they think of themselves as the smartest in the room, according to University of Pennsylvania Law School Professor Jill Fisch.  \u201cThat works against them in depositions and is even worse in court.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Research firm IHS Markit forecasts that more than 130 models in the U.S. market, from 43 brands, will offer electrified propulsion systems, either pure battery electric or hybrid gasoline-electric.  But two-thirds of those sales will be registered by the top 10 brands, dominated by segment leader Tesla which will take up more than a quarter of those sales, according to IHS automotive analyst Stephanie Brinley.  The remaining brands will account for an estimated 392,000 units, an average of just 11,900 cars per brand, she said.  \u201cIn the near-term, EV competition will be extremely high,\u201d Brinley said. \u201cIncreased choice and availability will drive sales growth, but the number of vehicle introductions is initially outpacing demand for the electric propulsion option.\u201d  The market for EVs is growing fast, IHS Markit projected.  In 2026, 48 brands will sell a total of 16.8 million vehicles (including EVs), which works out to an average of 350,000 sales per brand in the overall market.  Pure electric and hybrid vehicles will account for 7.6% of those sales, compared with only 1.2% in 2018.  Tesla was the No. 20 brand in overall U.S. sales last year, according to trade publication Automotive News. But new competition is coming from a gaggle of global automakers, notably Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co.  Tesla, which delivered 240,000 EVs to global customers last year and expects to sell 360,000 to 400,000 this year, will continue to dominate the market in 2026, IHS Markit predicts, with average sales of other brands at about 25,000 units each.  But even Tesla has struggled to make money for most of its nine years as a public company. It reported a first-quarter loss of more than $700 million on sales of 63,000 vehicles. Shares were down at $188.10 in mid-day trade Wednesday.  Much of the industry\u2019s planned $300 billion investment in electric vehicles and batteries over the next decade is targeted at China, which is projecting EV and plug-in hybrid sales in 2025 of at least 5 million, or up to 20% of total vehicle sales.  The structure of the EV market in the United States is not unlike the broader market, just on a smaller scale. Last year, the top 10 brands in the United States accounted for nearly three-quarters of the 17.3 million vehicles sold, according to Automotive News.","1392":"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 17 (Reuters) - German luxury car brand Audi on Monday staged the global launch of a new electric sport utility vehicle on the home turf of rival Tesla Inc, and highlighted a deal with Amazon.com Inc to make recharging its forthcoming e-tron models easier.  The Audi e-tron midsize SUV will be offered in the United States next year at a starting price of $75,795 before a $7,500 tax credit. It is one of a volley of electric vehicles coming from Volkswagen AG brands, as well as other European premium brands including Daimler-owned Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volvo Cars and Jaguar Land Rover.  All aim to expand the market for premium electric vehicles and also to grab share of that market from Palo Alto, California-based Tesla, which has had the niche largely to itself.  \u201cI want Audi to be the number-one electric vehicle seller in America over the long term,\u201d Audi of America President Scott Keogh told Reuters in an interview on Monday.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who is also head of rocket company SpaceX, planned to mark the e-tron launch occasion by staging a SpaceX event in Los Angeles at roughly the same time on Monday evening as Audi\u2019s unveiling.  Audi and parent Volkswagen are using the U.S. launch of the e-tron SUV in mid-2019 to take aim at one obstacle to expanding electric vehicle sales - the lack of convenient ways to recharge their batteries.  Audi will partner with online retailer Amazon to sell and install home electric vehicle charging systems to buyers of the e-tron, the companies said on Monday. Amazon will deliver the hardware and hire electricians to install them through its Amazon Home Services operation.  Amazon\u2019s partnership with Audi to provide home charging systems is the first time the online retailer has struck such a deal with an automaker, and signals a new front in Amazon\u2019s drive to expand its reach into consumers\u2019 homes beyond the presence of its Alexa smart speakers in living rooms and kitchens.  \u201cWe see charging installation as a very important business,\u201d Pat Bigatel, director of Amazon Home Services, told Reuters at Audi\u2019s launch event in San Francisco\u2019s Bill Graham Civic Center.  Audi executives said home charging stations would cost about $1,000, depending on the home\u2019s electrical system.  Tesla offers wall connectors for home charging at a $500 list price, and will arrange for installation, according to the company.  At the same time, Electrify America, a company funded by Volkswagen as part of its settlement of U.S. diesel emission cheating litigation, plans to launch next year the next round of installations of public charging stations, Electrify America executives told Reuters.  Tesla has developed its own network of Supercharger charging stations with more than 11,000 chargers in North America. Electrify America plans to have 2,000 chargers installed by mid-June next year. Those will be open to any vehicle, and customers can swipe a credit card to recharge.  \u201cWe want to work with all\u201d automotive brands, said Giovanni Palazzo, Electrify America\u2019s chief executive.  LIFTING THE CURTAIN  Audi has been heralding the launch of the e-tron SUV for some time, but until Monday it had not shared many details of the vehicle.  The e-tron is electric, and has two electric motors - one in the front and one in the rear - driving all four wheels. The Hungarian factory building motors for the e-tron will start with a production pace equivalent to 200 vehicles a day, Audi officials said.  In Europe, the vehicle will use cameras instead of conventional mirrors to give drivers a view to the rear. That feature is still not approved by U.S. regulators.  However, in many other respects the e-tron is a conventional, mainstream luxury SUV. It offers seating for five, and its length and wheelbase position it in the center of the market for midsize, five-passenger luxury SUVs such as the BMW X5. The e-tron is 5 inches (13 cm) shorter than the Tesla Model X, and it has conventional doors. The Model X uses vertically opening \u201cfalcon wing\u201d doors.  The e-tron will have an advanced cruise-control system that can keep the car within a lane and maintain a set distance behind another vehicle, but the system will be designed so that drivers must keep hands on the wheel.  Audi officials said they do not have official range estimates for the e-tron SUV under U.S. testing procedures. The e-tron\u2019s 95 kWh battery has less capacity than the 100 kWh battery used in the Tesla Model X 100D model, but more than the base Model X 75D.  The Model X 100D is rated at 295 miles (475 km) of range by the U.S. government.","1393":"FILE PHOTO: The Tesla logo is pictured on a car during the electric car E-Rallye Baltica 2019 in Bauska, Latvia, July 23, 2019. REUTERS\/Ints Kalnins\/File Photo  SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc TSLA.O had raised prices for some vehicles in China as the yuan trades at its weakest levels in more than a decade.  The starting price for the Model X sport utility vehicle (SUV) is now 809,900 yuan ($114,186), versus 790,900 yuan previously, according to Tesla\u2019s China website on Friday.  Its long-range dual-motor variants of mass-market Model 3 cars are now 439,900 yuan, up from 429,900 yuan previously.  The U.S.-China trade frictions and a tit-for-tat tariff war between the countries has prompted Tesla, which currently imports all the cars it sells in China, to adjust its prices multiple times over the past year.  The latest hike comes as China allowed the yuan to weaken against the U.S. dollar earlier this month, raising the cost of imports and prompting Washington to label China a currency manipulator. Beijing has strongly opposed the label.  People familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this week that Tesla would hike prices due to the currency uncertainty and could do so again in December should Chinese tariffs on U.S.-made cars take effect.  Tesla is currently building its first overseas factory in Shanghai, which is expected to help the firm minimize the impact of the trade war. It is due to start production by the end of the year and Tesla has said it should be able to build 3,000 Model 3 vehicles a week in its initial phases.  While Tesla does not disclose sales by country, consultancy LMC Automotive estimates it sold 23,678 vehicles in China in the first seven months this year, including 17,451 Model 3 cars.","1394":"TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Panasonic Corp 6752.T are set to launch a joint venture next year to produce batteries for electric vehicles (EV) in an effort to compete with Chinese rivals, a source familiar with the matter said.

REUTERS\/Toru Hanai  The joint venture, to be owned 51 percent by Toyota and the rest by Panasonic, could also provide batteries to Toyota's EV technology partners Mazda Corp 7261.T and Subaru Corp 7270.T, the source said on Sunday.  The source declined to be identified because the talks on the joint venture are private.  A joint venture would build on the agreement that the pair announced in late 2017 on joint development of batteries with higher energy density in a prismatic cell arrangement.  A Toyota spokesman said the two companies have been working on the battery partnership announced in 2017 and declined to comment further. Panasonic made the same comment in a statement.  The two companies may announce the joint venture plan as early as this week, according to the source.  The battery joint venture will help Toyota achieve an annual sales target of around 1 million zero-emission battery EVs and fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) by 2030.  It will also give Panasonic cost and scale advantages in battery production at a time when China's Contemporary Amperex Technology 300750.SZ has grown to be on par with the long-time industry leader on the back of the rapidly growing home market.  Panasonic, the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla Inc's TSLA.O current production models, could also reduce its heavy reliance on the U.S. EV maker whose production delays previously weighed on the Japanese company's earnings.  Panasonic is set to lose its exclusivity as Tesla plans to source cell production locally at a new auto plant in Shanghai, \u201cmost likely from several companies\u201d including Panasonic, Elon Musk, Tesla chief executive, tweeted in November.  The reported joint venture plan boosted shares of Panasonic by as much as 4 percent on Monday, whereas Toyota shares were almost flat.  Under the planned joint venture, Panasonic would shift most of its prismatic battery-related equipment and facilities in Japan and China to the joint venture, while those producing batteries for Tesla will remain under the company, the source said.  Panasonic already makes prismatic batteries for Toyota, whereas for Tesla it makes cylindrical batteries of a type similar to those used in laptops.  It's not clear yet how Panasonic would supply its prismatic batteries to other automotive clients, which include Honda Motor 7267.T and Ford Motor F.N.","1395":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O said on Wednesday it was launching an insurance service designed to give drivers in California, its biggest market, lower rates because of safety features on its electric vehicles.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Tesla carmaker is seen inside a car at the Top Marques fair in Monaco May 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Eric Gaillard  Chief Executive Elon Musk has been one of the strongest proponents of the idea that car insurance rates should plummet as driver-assist and self-driving technology become standard. Tesla said rates of its new plan were as much as 20% lower than those of rivals but did not provide comparisons.  The company did not name an insurance partner, but the California Department of Insurance website showed Tesla was licensed as a broker to conduct business on behalf of the State National Insurance Company Inc, a unit of Markel Corp MKL.N.  Tesla has said its Model 3 sedan had the lowest probability of injury of vehicles tested by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The agency responded that Tesla was making \u201cmisleading statements\u201d and last October sent the company a cease-and-desist letter over the claims.  The company\u2019s cars generally rank among the most expensive vehicles to insure due to their high repair costs for components and sensor equipment, according to safety researchers and insurance providers.  A 2018 review by financial research provider 24\/7 Wall St., analyzing claim frequency and insurance cost data by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, ranked the Tesla Model S and Model X at the top of the list of most expensive vehicles to insure.  Representatives of State National Insurance Company did not immediately return calls and emails requesting comment.  Tesla said it would offer \u201ccomprehensive coverage\u201d and claims processing to customers in California, and that it would expand to additional U.S. states in the future.  State National filed an application for the Tesla program in November 2018, which California regulators approved in April.  The use of data from vehicles and consumers will allow for lower costs to attract and service insurance customers, State National wrote in a memorandum that was part of the application.  Data from Tesla vehicles, when in autonomous mode, \u201cwill decrease the frequency and severity of collision claims for Tesla owners,\u201d a factor that State National said will allow it to offer insurance at a lower cost.  Its insurance pricing also cuts out certain fees that traditional insurers charge, Tesla said. The nature of those fees is unclear.","1396":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Monday it could seek alternative sources of financing, days after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk reached a deal with U.S. securities regulators to settle a dispute over his Twitter use, removing an overhang on the stock.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Tesla is seen in Taipei, Taiwan August 11, 2017. REUTERS\/Tyrone Siu\/File Photo  Shares of the electric carmaker rose 1.8 percent to $239.42 in late trading.  Tesla said in a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it expects cash generated from its business to be enough to fund its investments and pay down debt for at least the next 12 months, but that it may decide to raise debt to fund growth.  Wall Street has been looking for more details after Musk last week said, \u201cIt\u2019s probably about the right time\u201d to raise capital. He was speaking after the company posted a $700 million loss for the first quarter.  Many analysts had predicted the company would need to raise funds for its expansion, including the Shanghai factory, the upcoming Model Y SUV and other projects.  Musk\u2019s agreement with the SEC on Friday puts the focus back on execution as Tesla tries to ramp up production of its most important vehicle, the Model 3 sedan, and make a profit at the same time.  So far, Tesla has raised funds through bank loans, several rounds of equity sales, issued convertible notes, a $1.8 billion junk bond sale, securitization of its vehicle leases and solar asset-backed notes.  The company\u2019s preferred method for raising capital in public debt markets has been through convertible securities, with seven issued since 2013. These have allowed it to raise funds at a lower interest rate than plain-vanilla bonds because investors are willing to accept a lower coupon for the prospect of converting the debt to equity.  Of Tesla\u2019s three convertibles to have reached maturity to date, however, only one has been converted into equity. The company\u2019s stock failed to reach the conversion price for the other two, forcing it to repay the bondholders in cash.  The company paid off $920 million in debt earlier this year and a $566 million repayment is due in November.  \u201cIt\u2019s all speculation but beyond the bond and equity markets Tesla could do a direct cash investment from an investor like a big private equity firm or a firm like SoftBank,\u201d Morningstar analyst David Whiston said.  He said the company is more likely to just issue equity, adding that \u201cthe share count is so small relative to big automakers and the cash raise would ease any investor anxiety that the market probably would not severely punish the dilution, if at all\u201d.  Tesla is rated six notches into noninvestment grade, or junk bond, territory by both Moody\u2019s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings. Both rating agencies have a negative outlook on the company\u2019s debt.  \u201cIf it was just straight debt they\u2019d have to pay a higher interest rate. But convertible investors are willing to pay for some potential future upside in the equity,\u201d Geoffrey Dancey, managing partner and portfolio manager at Cutler Capital Management said after Musk\u2019s comments on Wednesday.  \u201cTesla, of all companies, sells the story of their upside.\u201d  The company expects capital expenditures of $2 billion to $2.5 billion this year and about $2.5 billion to $3 billion annually for the next two fiscal years, a spokesperson told Reuters.  Tesla\u2019s $1.8 billion junk bond sank half a cent to yield 8.42 percent on Friday, more than 3 percentage points above the bond\u2019s coupon rate of 5.3 percent.  Its spread, or the premium investors demand for the added risk of holding Tesla debt rather than a safer U.S. Treasury security, widened by about 15 basis points to a near-record 611 basis points.  Tesla has in the past talked about raising funds through alternative sources, but interest has spiked following Musk\u2019s comments on raising capital.","1397":"Nov 8 (Reuters) - Robyn Denholm will replace Elon Musk as chair of Tesla Inc, CNBC reported on Thursday.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The Japanese automaker unveiled updated self-driving technology a month after Tesla Inc\u2019s Chief Executive Elon Musk called lidar \u201ca fool\u2019s errand\u201d, berating the technology for being expensive and unnecessary.  Nissan, which wants to have its self-driving cars on city streets by 2020, has long shunned lidar, a relatively new technology for automobiles which has recently been the subject of an influx in investment by many of its rivals.  \u201cAt the moment, lidar lacks the capabilities to exceed the capabilities of the latest technology in radar and cameras,\u201d Tetsuya Iijima, general manager of advanced technology development for automated driving, told reporters at Nissan\u2019s headquarters.  \u201cIt would be fantastic if lidar technology was at the level that we could use it in our systems, but it\u2019s not. There\u2019s an imbalance between its cost and its capabilities.\u201d  Iijima unveiled Nissan\u2019s own latest self-driving technology, which enables hands-free driving in single lanes on highways on predefined routes.  The technology, to be released in Japan later this year, uses radar and sonar sensors along with cameras to compile the three-dimensional mapping data required for cars to \u201csee\u201d their surroundings.  Apart from sonar, side radar and around-view monitoring cameras, Nissan said it has developed a \u201ctri-cam\u201d that focuses on three points to the front and sides of the vehicle to capture a wide area of view.  Tesla also relies on cameras and radars for its self-driving technology.  Nissan wants to add its self-driving technology to more of its affordable models to boost sales and recover from a profit slump. When reporting earnings earlier this week, the automaker said it had hit \u201crock bottom\u201d in the aftermath of a financial scandal involving its ousted Chairman Carlos Ghosn.  FOOL\u2019S ERRAND?  Lidar is currently used by companies including General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Waymo as automakers and tech firms race to develop self-driving cars.  Lidar technology uses light-based sensors that fire roughly 1 million laser pulses a second as it collects measurements that are analyzed and processed into 3D models and maps.  More than $1 billion in corporate and private investment has been pumped into some 50 lidar startups over the past three years, according to a Reuters analysis in March of publicly available investment data.  Still, it is a technology in flux.  Initially using bulky spinning devices placed on the roof of cars, lidar developers have transitioned to more compact solid-state devices that can be mounted on other parts of a car. These now sell for less than $10,000 in limited quantities, and are widely expected to eventually sell for as little as $200 in mass production.","1399":"FILE PHOTO: SpaceX owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk speaks during a conversation with legendary game designer Todd Howard (not pictured) at the E3 gaming convention in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 13, 2019.

Chief Executive Elon Musk is under intense pressure to deliver on his promise of stabilizing production for the company\u2019s mass market sedans, seen crucial to it easing a cash crunch and achieving long-term profitability.  The company said it was churning out almost 1,000 of the cars a day, broadly in line with Musk\u2019s promises but slightly short of Wall Street expectations.

However, traders and analysts say the kinds of volumes Tesla would need are unlikely to make a compelling business case for most miners to invest in increased production, nor are they likely to boost prices.  Tesla currently sources nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) batteries from South Korea\u2019s LG Chem Ltd and nickel-cobalt-aluminium (NCA) batteries from Japan\u2019s Panasonic Corp.  These companies indirectly buy nickel from mining companies in a long auto supply chain. Tesla doesn\u2019t disclose which nickel miners are in its supply chain.  Given Tesla\u2019s focus on sustainability, the company is likely to prefer to buy from miners of higher-grade nickel sulphide, which requires less power to process than laterite ore, said Lachlan Shaw of National Australia Bank.  There are three key suppliers - Brazil\u2019s Vale, which operates in Canada using some hydropower, Russia\u2019s Norilsk Nickel and BHP Group\u2019s operations in Western Australia. \u201cVale is in the box seat,\u201d he said.  While electric vehicles consume a much smaller amount of nickel than traditional industries such as stainless steel makers, EVs are expected to be the quickest growth market for nickel miners.  Nickel consumption in EV battery materials is expected to soar 64% between 2019 and 2025, research firm Wood Mackensie said, although it added that satisfying this demand could be challenging for an industry that has been slow to add capacity in a timely and cost-effective manner.  \u201cHe needs nickel, so he hopes nickel prices will go lower and lower,\u201d said a China-based nickel trader. \u201cPrices will not be impacted in the short-term because the market is in surplus.\u201d  Nickel hit a 14-month low of $10,865 a tonne in March but has since recovered to $13,180, still down by some 30% from five-year peaks seen in September.  Tesla on Wednesday posted a second-quarter profit, but Musk said he would prioritise growth over profit going forward, and focus on making Tesla vehicles more affordable.  \u201cThe real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at affordable price. That\u2019s the real limit,\u201d Musk said, adding the company would expand its business with Panasonic and CATL and \u201cpossibly with others\u201d.  Tesla is expected to reveal technological advances at its \u201cBattery Day\u201d event in September.","1405":"(Reuters) - Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services on Thursday recommended Tesla Inc TSLA.O stockholders reject a multi-billion-dollar, 10-year pay package for Chief Executive Elon Musk, saying the \"unprecedented\" award was too rich.

Planning permission has not yet been granted to build the Gigafactory, however, meaning U.S. entrepreneur Elon Musk\u2019s company is preparing the ground at its own risk.  In a statement, the court said it had issued the order to stop the tree-felling because it would have only taken three more days to complete the work.  Otherwise the clearance would have been completed before judges made a final decision on the complaint brought by a local environmentalist group called the Gruene Liga Brandenburg (Green League of Brandenburg).  \u201cIt should not be assumed that the motion seeking legal protection brought by the Green League lacks any chance of succeeding,\u201d the court statement added.

He said making one would be a distraction and have a small market.  Analysts have questioned whether there is global demand for the hundreds of thousands of Model 3 sedans and other vehicles Tesla aims to produce, after deliveries fell 31% in the first quarter. Rivals are stepping up efforts and Tesla continues to invest heavily in expansion.  Musk\u2019s positive comments on Tuesday echoed his forecast last month that the company was on track to hit record deliveries in the second quarter.  Tesla previously said it plans to deliver 90,000 to 100,000 vehicles to customers in the second quarter versus 63,000 vehicles in the first, and is aiming to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles in 2019.

Autopilot, a form of advanced cruise control, handles some driving tasks and warns those behind the wheel they are always responsible for the vehicle\u2019s safe operation. But a spate of recent crashes has brought the system under regulatory scrutiny.  \"To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features,\" Musk tweeted here on Sunday, replying to a Twitter user.  Musk said the autopilot issue during lane-merging is better in the current software and will be fully fixed in the August update.  However, it was not clear what self-driving features would be included in the August update.  Tesla has been gradually upgrading its Autopilot features with regular software updates.  Tesla\u2019s documentation on its website about the \u201cfull self-driving capabilities\u201d package says that it is not possible to know exactly when each element of the functionality will be available, as this is highly dependent on local regulatory approval.  A consumer advocacy group on Friday urged Tesla to fix what it termed as \u201cflaws\u201d in Autopilot after a preliminary government report said a Model X driver did not have his hands on the vehicle\u2019s steering wheel in the final six seconds before a fatal crash on March 23.  \u201cThe software update is good news,\u201d said analyst Chaim Siegel from Elazar Advisors, adding the stock was still benefiting from last week\u2019s prediction by Musk that it would finally hit its production target for its Model 3 sedan.  Tesla\u2019s shares were last up 3.3 percent at $327.93 on Monday after touching a high of $333.  The company\u2019s future profitability hinges on ramping up Model 3 output, and the company has suffered from a series of failures to hit its weekly target.

Slideshow ( 5 images )  QUESTIONS ABOUT ACCIDENT  In last week\u2019s accident, it was unclear if Tesla\u2019s automated control system was driving the car. The accident involved two other cars, the NTSB and police said. Tesla vehicles have a system called Autopilot that handles some driving tasks. The 38-year-old Tesla driver died at a nearby hospital shortly after the crash.  Late Tuesday, Tesla said in a blog post it does \u201cnot yet know what happened in the moments leading up to the crash,\u201d but added data shows that Tesla owners have driven the same stretch of highway with Autopilot engaged \u201croughly 85,000 times... and there has never been an accident that we know of.\u201d  The company said it is working with authorities to recover the logs from the computer inside the vehicle to try to gain a better understanding of what happened. The company statement did not address if the crashed vehicle was in Autopilot mode.  \u201cWe have been deeply saddened by this accident, and we have offered our full cooperation to the authorities as we work to establish the facts of the incident,\u201d Tesla said in a statement earlier.  Government scrutiny of the Palo Alto, California company is mounting. This is the second NTSB field investigation into a Tesla crash since January.  The California Highway Patrol said the electric-powered Tesla Model X crashed into a freeway divider on Friday and then was hit by a Mazda before colliding with an Audi.  The Tesla\u2019s lithium batteries caught fire, and emergency officials consulted company engineers before determining how to extinguish the battery fire and move the vehicle safely. NTSB said the issues being examined include the post-crash fire and removing the vehicle from the scene.  The Tesla blog post said Tesla battery packs are designed to ensure that a battery spreads slowly in the rare circumstance it catches fire.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  In January, the NTSB and U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sent investigators to California to investigate the crash of a fire truck and a Tesla that apparently was traveling in semi-autonomous mode. The agencies have not disclosed any findings.  The NTSB can make safety recommendations but only NHTSA can order automakers to recall unsafe vehicles or fine automakers if they fail to remedy safety defects in a timely fashion. Before the agency can demand a recall, it must open a formal investigation, a step it has not yet taken.  Tesla\u2019s Autopilot allows drivers under certain conditions to take their hands off the wheel for extended periods. Still, Tesla requires users to agree to keep their hands on the wheel \u201cat all times\u201d before they can use Autopilot.  The NTSB faulted Tesla in a prior fatal Autopilot crash.  In September, NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said operational limitations in the Tesla Model S played a major role in a May 2016 crash in Florida that killed a driver using Autopilot. That crash raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for long stretches but cannot completely replace human drivers.  Tesla in September 2016 unveiled improvements to Autopilot, adding new limits on hands-off driving.","1419":"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O Chief Executive Elon Musk faces votes at Tuesday's shareholder meeting that will challenge his grip on the electric carmaker, but he may be able to count on some powerful friends: big fund managers likely to be fans.

They expect shareholders to elect three Tesla directors and vote to let Musk keep his chairman\u2019s title despite investor challenges and broader concerns with Tesla\u2019s production.  \"We're making a bet on Elon Musk,\" said one top-20 Tesla investor who plans to back the directors and vote to keep Musk's roles intact. The investor compared Musk to Apple Inc AAPL.O founder Steve Jobs, saying, \"These people are geniuses. You either believe in him or you don't.\"  Said Morningstar analyst David Whiston, referring to big, actively managed funds holding Tesla, \u201cI doubt they would vote against Elon because if you don\u2019t believe in Elon, why are you in the stock?\u201d  Tesla has been fighting negative press for several months over production bottlenecks for its Model 3 sedan, crashes involving its cars and doubts raised by Wall Street over its cash position.  Union-affiliated investment adviser CtW Investment Group is attempting to unseat three Tesla directors it says lack qualifications or independence, including investor Antonio Gracias, Tesla's lead independent director; James Murdoch, the CEO of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOXA.O; and sustainable food executive Kimbal Musk, Elon Musk's brother.  Another investor proposes splitting the chairman and CEO jobs, both of which Musk fills, arguing the sprawling company has become difficult to oversee.  Influential proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis have backed the split of Musk\u2019s roles and mostly opposed the three directors, the only ones up for election this year.  If any of the challenges wins a majority of votes, that could undermine confidence in Musk at a time when he is counting on workers to pull out the stops to ramp up production of the Model 3 sedan and as some analysts expect the company to raise new capital. Shares are down around 7 percent year-to-date.  Tesla says it does not need new funds. Asked about the voting expectations, Tesla spokesman Kamran Mumtaz referred to filings the company has made that outline the directors\u2019 qualifications. Tesla has said its governance structure allows it to avoid pressure by short-term investors.  Wild cards that may decide the outcome will be the votes of funds run by T. Rowe Price Group TROW.O and Fidelity Investments, institutions that owned about 9 percent and 8 percent of Tesla stock, respectively, as of the end of March, trailing only Musk's stake of roughly 20 percent.  T. Rowe Price's Growth Stock Fund PRGFX.O broke with Tesla last year and supported a measure calling for Tesla to have its directors elected annually. The measure received the support of about 46 percent of shares voted by outside investors, assuming Musk voted his stake in opposition.  Researcher Proxy Insight found T. Rowe Price and Fidelity, known for their actively managed funds, last year voted for dissident director slates in proxy contests more frequently than the largely passive manager BlackRock Inc BLK.N.  But voting against specific directors is often seen as a \u201clast resort,\u201d said Nick Dawson, Proxy Insight managing director.  And T. Rowe was supportive of management on a high-profile vote earlier this year that put Musk on track for what could be the largest executive payout in corporate history, according to ISS calculations.  Anne Sheehan, who retired earlier this year as head of corporate governance for the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, said she expected big funds would vote according to board recommendations and raise any concerns privately with Musk.  Their message, she said, will be: \u201cIf he\u2019s a car company, he\u2019s got to produce cars.\u201d","1420":"Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk speaks at an opening ceremony for Tesla China-made Model Y program in Shanghai, China January 7, 2020.

His Palo Alto, California-based car company, which reported a $104 million second-quarter profit on Wednesday afternoon, is close to topping $300 billion in market capitalization, leaving the company accounting for around a third of the entire industry\u2019s stock-market value. As wacky as that is, it does have a link to reality.  At its current stock price, Tesla is trading at 97 times estimated 2022 earnings, according to Refinitiv data. That implies shareholders expect the company soon to be selling millions more cars a year than the fewer than 400,000 it delivered in 2019.  The electric exuberance has rubbed off elsewhere: Rivian, which counts Amazon.com, BlackRock and Ford Motor among its investors, has raised almost $4 billion since December; its SUV and pick-up truck are due to go on sale next year. Meanwhile, two early-stage rivals have just sold to special-purpose acquisition companies: A deal last week values Fisker, which wants to sell the \u201cmost emotional and sustainable vehicles,\u201d at $2.9 billion. Nikola, which closed its SPAC merger last month, is now worth $14 billion \u2013 almost as much as Nissan Motor, Peugeot owner PSA and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.  There\u2019s logic to what Tesla\u2019s valuation, especially, says about the prospects for electric cars. Assume the number sold globally grows by a third each year from 2.2 million in 2019. Markets like China have actually been growing far more quickly. Falling battery prices, tighter vehicle-emissions rules and more charging stations will help, too.  It would mean around 12 million electric cars are sold in 2025. Factor in an average price of $30,000, a generous 12% pre-tax margin, a 25% tax rate and a multiple of 18 times earnings for a more mature but still growing market, and that\u2019s $590 billion of total shareholder value to the entire market for electric vehicles. Apply a 10% annual discount rate and that\u2019s $350 billion today, just $30 billion more than the value public or private investors have ascribed to Tesla, Rivian, Nikola and Fisker combined.  Trouble is, investors are assuming those four have a virtual lock on the market. Yet traditional carmakers are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in electrification and account for most of the 200 different models due to come to market over the next five years. Investors will need to switch their ride in the middle of the race.","1421":"WARSAW, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Daimler AG does not rule out cooperating with Tesla Inc in future even though the German luxury car producer sold its stake in the U.S. electric vehicles company, Daimler\u2019s chief executive told a Polish newspaper.

Traders shorting Tesla have lost about $900 million in just the first two trading days of 2020, adding to mark-to-market losses of $2.9 billion last year, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.  Tesla said on Friday it delivered 112,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter, beating expectations of 104,960 vehicles, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. It delivered approximately 367,500 vehicles during all of 2019, just meeting the low end of its target to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles.  That report pushed Tesla\u2019s stock up 3.7% to $446.21, bringing its gain in the past three months to about 90% in a rally fueled by a surprise third quarter profit and signs of progress ramping up production at the company\u2019s new factory in China.  Tesla on Friday said it demonstrated a production run-rate capability of more than 3,000 units per week at the Shanghai factory.  Overall short interest in Tesla is about $11.9 billion, and while some traders have cut their losses in recent months, Friday\u2019s rally did not appear to be forcing significantly more traders to capitulate, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of Predictive Analytics at S3 Partners.  About 21% of Tesla\u2019s shares are currently sold short, down from about 28% in October, according to S3 Partners.  Chief Executive Elon Musk's progress has defied skeptics expecting Tesla to be overtaken by more established car companies, including General Motors Co GM.N, Ford Motor Co F.N and BMW BMWG.DE.  \u201cWe think questions remain about first half 2020 results and gross margin sustainability; we point out that Tesla is already lowering prices in China and faces a flood of (electric vehicle) competition in the U.S., with at least 25 new models debuting this year,\u201d CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson wrote in a client note on Friday. Nelson upped his price target for Tesla by $80 to $400 and maintained his \u201chold\u201d opinion.  Worries about demand for Telsa\u2019s Model 3 sedan sent the company\u2019s stock down to 2016 lows last June, but since then the shares have surged 150%.  The gains in Tesla\u2019s shares have elevated its market capitalization to $80 billion, compared to GM\u2019 market value of $52 billion and Ford\u2019s market capitalization of $37 billion.","1424":"(Changes slug for media subscribers, no change to text)  WASHINGTON, June 26 (Reuters) - A Tesla Inc Model S involved in a May 8 fatal high-speed crash in Florida reignited twice after firefighters extinguished a fire in the electric vehicle, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said in a preliminary report on Tuesday.  The report said the vehicle was traveling 116 miles per hour seconds before it crashed into a metal light pole. The Fort Lauderdale Fire Department found the vehicle fully engulfed in flames and extinguished the vehicle fire using 200\u2013300 gallons of water and foam, the NTSB said.

Tesla\u2019s plan to issue shares and convertible debt comes after the company repeatedly pushed back forecasts for turning a profit. The company faces expensive challenges, including launching production in China, overhauling its U.S. retail and service operations and developing new models, including the high-volume Model Y SUV and a Semi commercial truck.  Many analysts had calculated that Tesla - which burned through $1.5 billion in the first quarter - would not be able to carry out its growth plans without new cash.  \u201cThe market seems to be breathing a sigh of relief. Now they need to get back to work, and start selling more cars,\u201d said Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin.  Shares of Tesla rose 4.3 percent to close at $244.10, while the yield on Tesla\u2019s existing $1.8 billion junk bond fell to its lowest level in over a month.  \u201cThis is how they pay for the factory in China, the Model Y, their 2020 goals, said Ross Gerber, chief executive of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki.  Raising $650 million in new shares and $1.35 billion in debt, while giving underwriters the option to buy an additional 15 percent of each offering, could potentially raise the proceeds to $2.3 billion.  Tesla later priced its stock offering at $243 per share and also increased its size to 3.1 million shares from 2.7 million shares, Bloomberg reported after market hours on Thursday, citing a person familiar with the matter.  This stock offering price would be at a discount of 0.5 percent to the close on Thursday.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Tesla was not immediately available to comment on the report.  Chief Executive Officer Musk would also pitch in $10 million of his own money, Tesla said in a filing.  For over a year, Musk had insisted that the money-losing Silicon Valley automaker had no need for a capital raise, saying that high Model 3 volume and efficiency would push the company to profit in all quarters of 2019. That changed with a $702 million loss in the first quarter, and warnings that profit would be delayed until the latter half of the year.  Raising capital should not be a substitute for operating effectively, Musk said last month, suggesting that a capital raise could be near. \u201cIt\u2019s healthy to be on a Spartan diet for a while,\u201d he said.  Before Tesla\u2019s announcement on Thursday, however, analysts speculating about a capital raise had cautioned that the company had missed optimal timing - last year\u2019s third quarter, when the company posted a profit.  Tesla has reported four profitable quarters since it went public in June 2010.  The company has made a series of moves to rework pricing strategies for its cars following the reduction of a $7,500 federal tax credit for Tesla buyers by half, a decline that hurt first-quarter deliveries.  Musk also has been distracted by a public feud with U.S. regulators. Shares in the company have dropped 28% since the beginning of the year.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  LOWER COUPON  Tesla ended its first quarter with $2.2 billion in cash. In 2019, it expects capital expenditures of $2 billion to $2.5 billion and about $2.5 billion to $3 billion annually for 2020 and 2021.  Throughout its history, Tesla has raised funds through bank loans, equity sales, convertible notes, a junk bond sale, securitization of its vehicle leases and solar asset-backed notes.  Convertible bonds, which permit an issuer to repay creditors in new stock rather than cash if certain conditions are met, have been among Tesla\u2019s most preferred vehicles for raising capital. They typically allow a borrower to raise capital at a lower interest rate than an ordinary bond because the investor has the potential for a greater return should the conversion terms be met.  The convertible notes announced on Thursday are seen carrying a coupon rate of between 1.5% and 2.0% with a conversion premium of between 27.5% and 32.5% over the reference price for Tesla shares at the time of the sale, according to a trader who saw preliminary marketing materials for the deal.  The convert is being marketed with a higher conversion premium than its last convertible bond, issued in March 2017, meaning Tesla shares will have to rise by an even larger magnitude to trigger a conversion to equity.  Tesla\u2019s last convert was a $977.5-million security maturing in March 2022 that featured a 2.375% coupon with a 25% conversion premium to the stock\u2019s reference price of $262 per share at the time of the sale. That bond can be converted to equity at a price of $327.50 per share, which is currently around 36% above Tesla\u2019s current share price of around $240.  In March, Tesla had to repay a $920 million convertible in cash because the stock failed to reach the conversion price of around $360 per share. Only one of the convertibles it or its Solar City unit have issued has met the terms for conversion.  The yield on Tesla\u2019s existing $1.8 billion junk bond fell to its lowest level in over a month at just over 8 percent on Thursday after the news, roughly 2.7 percentage points above its 5.3% coupon.  Goldman Sachs and Citigroup will manage the offering. BofA Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank Securities, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse are the additional book-running managers.  Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have $507 million in outstanding personal loans to Musk, with his Tesla shares put up as collateral, according to Thursday\u2019s prospectus. If Tesla\u2019s stock falls, the banks could force him to sell some of those shares. Tesla\u2019s previous prospectus in 2017 showed Musk had $624 million in personal loans from banks, backed by his shares.  In a sign of Wall Street\u2019s concern about Tesla, Goldman Sachs recommended selling Tesla shares in an April 25 report, putting a 12-month price target of $200.","1426":"OAKLAND, Calif, June 11 (Reuters) - A Tesla Inc employee organizing a union was asked by a supervisor and company security guards to leave the factory after handing out pro-union flyers, the worker testified at a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) hearing on Monday over whether Tesla had violated federal safeguards for employee activity.  The NLRB general counsel brought the case before a board administrative law judge after receiving complaints from three Tesla workers and the United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW).  If Tesla loses, the company could be required to notify its employees that it was found to be committing unfair labor practices, a victory for union organizers.  The case comes as Tesla has struggled to ramp up production of the Model 3, a sedan intended for volume production that is key to the company achieving long-term profitability.  Tesla has denied the allegations and described them as an effort to make Chief Executive Elon Musk look bad.  Michael Sanchez, who has worked at Tesla since 2012 and is currently on medical leave, said he was asked to leave by security guards and a supervisor while handing out leaflets to colleagues outside a Tesla facility in February 2017.  \u201cWhat we see is a very heavy-handed, anti-union campaign that\u2019s affected all levels of workers\u2019 everyday lives,\u201d said Margo Feinberg, attorney with Schwartz, Steinsapir, Dohrmann & Sommers in her opening remarks for the UAW, which supports the NLRB counsel in the case.  Speaking on behalf of Tesla, Mark Ross of Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton LLP listed about two dozen other allegations against the company that were found to be without merit and dismissed.  \u201cThe fact of the matter is that Tesla is a company that values its employees,\u201d Ross said in his opening remarks.  In a series of tweets in May, Musk said he had not done anything to prevent unionizing efforts by workers. \u201cNothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted,\u201d Musk tweeted on May 20.  Hearings for the case are scheduled to continue through Thursday and resume in late September.

California-based Lucid Motors unveiled a prototype of a luxury sedan the Lucid Air at its unveiling in Fremont, California, U.S., December 14, 2016. REUTERS\/Alexandria Sage  The talks between privately-held Lucid Motors and PIF underscore the latter\u2019s appetite to invest in electric car makers to diversify the oil-rich Middle Eastern kingdom\u2019s investment portfolio.  A deal with Lucid Motors would also be more in line with PIF's limited resources, given that, despite its $250 billion in assets, PIF has already made substantial commitments to other technology companies or investments, including a $45-billion agreement to invest in a giant technology fund led by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T.  PIF and Lucid Motors have drawn up a term sheet under which PIF could invest more than $1 billion in Lucid Motors and obtain majority ownership, the sources said. PIF\u2019s first investment in Lucid Motors, however, would be for $500 million, and subsequent cash injections would come in two stages that are contingent on Lucid Motors hitting certain production milestones, one of the sources added.  The talks between PIF and Lucid Motors may not result in a deal, the sources cautioned.  The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. PIF and Lucid Motors did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Musk, a 47-year-old investor and engineer, stunned financial markets earlier this month, when he revealed on Twitter he was considering a $420 per share take-private deal for Tesla, an auto manufacturing pioneer that developed the world\u2019s first ever premium all-electric sedan car.  He added that funding was \u201csecured,\u201d and elaborated last Monday that he believed Saudi Arabia\u2019s PIF could provide the necessary funding, although sources close to the sovereign wealth fund have played down that prospect. Earlier this year, PIF built a stake of just under 5 percent in Tesla by snapping up shares in the open market, rather than acquiring newly issued shares.  Musk has also said he believes two-thirds of existing Tesla shareholders would roll over their holdings into a private company, rather than cash out, and that he was still talking with major shareholders and advisers before settling on a structure for a deal.  Getting access to cheap capital is a constant challenge for automakers, which can spend $1 billion or more engineering a single new model and bringing it to mass production, only to have the vehicle flop because of a cyclical sales slump or a shift in market tastes.  Based on the edges of Silicon Valley in Newark, California, Lucid Motors was founded in 2007 as Atieva by Bernard Tse, a former Tesla vice president and board member, and Sam Weng, a former exec at Oracle Corp and Redback Networks. It received backing from Chinese investors, including tech entrepreneur Jia Yueting and state-owned automaker BAIC. Other venture capital backers have included Venrock, Mitsui & Co and Tsing Capital.  Lucid Motors is not yet selling any cars. In 2016, it unveiled a prototype of its Lucid Air model, a $100,000 luxury sedan it had hoped to begin building in Arizona in late 2018. It is not clear when this car will become available, though the company is accepting refundable deposits of $2,500 from consumers on its website.  Tesla is much more advanced as an electric car manufacturer, though investors are questioning how long can it go before turning a profit. It has been burning through cash as it has aggressively ramped up Model 3 production, a process Musk has called \u201cproduction hell.\u201d  Analysts at UBS last week questioned the profitability of the Model 3, in a report that said Tesla could lose $6,000 on every base model.","1436":"Nov 25 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc has filed to recall about 9,136 Model X cars, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said here on Wednesday.

Tesla\u2019s market cap dropped $20 billion in just two hours after trading closed Tuesday, as Musk and other Tesla executives presented their new battery and manufacturing strategies. Shares closed down 5.6% and dropped another 6.9% after hours.  \u201cNothing Musk discussed about batteries is a done deal,\u201d said Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin. \u201cThere was nothing tangible.\u201d  Investors had expected two significant announcements at Musk\u2019s oft-touted \u201cBattery Day\u201d: The development of a \u201cmillion mile\u201d battery good for 10 years or more, and a specific cost reduction target -- expressed in dollars per kilowatt-hour -- that would finally drop the price of an electric vehicle below that of a gasoline car.  Musk offered neither. Instead, he promised over the next several years to slash battery costs in half with new technology and processes and deliver an \u201caffordable\u201d electric car.  \u201cIn three years . . . we can do a $25,000 car that will be basically on par (with), maybe slightly better than, a comparable gasoline car,\u201d Musk said.  Musk acknowledged that Tesla does not have its ambitious new vehicle and battery designs and manufacturing processes fully complete. Tesla has frequently missed production targets set by Musk.  Tesla expects to eventually be able to build as many as 20 million electric vehicles a year. This year, the entire auto industry expects to deliver 80 million cars globally.  Building an affordable electric car \u201chas always been our dream from the beginning of the company,\u201d Musk told an online audience of more than 270,000.  Tesla on Tuesday also introduced a new Model S Plaid, a 520-mile range sedan that can reach top speeds of up to 200 miles per hour (320 km per hour), with deliveries starting in 2021. The Plaid was listed on Tesla\u2019s website on Tuesday at a price of nearly $140,000.  RECYCLING BATTERIES  At the opening of the event, Musk walked on stage in a black t-shirt and jeans as about 240 shareholders -- each sitting in a Tesla Model 3 in the company parking lot -- honked their car horns in approval.  To help drive down vehicle cost, Musk described a new generation of batteries that will be more powerful, longer lasting and half as expensive than the company\u2019s current cells.  Tesla\u2019s new larger cylindrical cells will provide five times more energy, six times more power and far greater driving range, Musk said, adding that full production is about three years away.  To help reduce cost, Musk said Tesla planned to recycle battery cells at its Nevada \u201cgigafactory,\u201d while reducing cobalt -- one of the most expensive battery materials -- to virtually zero. It also plans to manufacture its own battery cells at several highly automated factories around the world.  Shares in two battery suppliers to Tesla, South Korea's LG Chem 051910.KS and Japan's Panasonic Corp 6752.T, fell after the announcement.  Tesla will produce the new battery cells initially on a new assembly line near its vehicle plant in Fremont, California, with planned output reaching 10 gigawatt-hours a year by the end of 2021.

Musk said Tesla could supply batteries to other companies.  As automakers shift from horsepower to kilowatts to comply with stricter environmental regulations, investors are looking for evidence that Tesla can increase its lead in electrification technology over legacy automakers who generate most of their sales and profits from combustion-engine vehicles.  While average electric vehicle prices have decreased in recent years thanks to changes in battery composition, they are still more expensive than conventional cars, with the battery estimated to make up a quarter to a third of an electric vehicle\u2019s cost.  Some researchers estimate that price parity, or the point at which electric vehicles are equal in value to internal combustion cars, is reached when battery packs cost $100 per kilowatt hour (kWh).  Tesla\u2019s battery packs cost $156 per kWh in 2019, according to electric vehicle consulting firm Cairn Energy Research Advisors.","1438":"FILE PHOTO: Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveils the Cybertruck at the TeslaDesign Studio in Hawthorne, Calif.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  The details, previously unreported, reveal that state-owned Shanghai Construction Group Co Ltd is taking part in the bidding while a unit of China Minmetals Corp Ltd is preparing materials for the plant\u2019s foundations.  The $2 billion factory, Tesla\u2019s first in China, is a major bet for the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) maker as it looks to bolster its presence in the world\u2019s biggest auto market where its earnings have been hit by increased tariffs on U.S. imports.  The so-called Gigafactory would also be China\u2019s first wholly foreign-owned car plant, whose progress is widely seen as a reflection of Sino-U.S. relations and also the degree to which China is opening up its markets.  Tesla, led by billionaire Chief Executive Elon Musk, has begun seeking bids from companies looking to build the plant, according to two people with knowledge of the matter and a construction document on an official local bidding platform.  Shanghai Construction Group is among several firms bidding, the two people said, declining to be identified because the information was not public.  Shanghai Baoye Group Co Ltd, a China Minmetals subsidiary, is preparing for the delivery of a large amount of concrete pipe piles and steel pile tips in the second half of December, showed a document on the metals giant\u2019s website.  Tesla declined to comment. Shanghai Construction Group did not respond to a request for comment. An official at Baoye parent China Metallurgical Group Corp [CNMET.UL], a Minmetals firm, confirmed involvement.  WORKING LATE  Tesla is facing rising competition in China from a swathe of domestic EV makers. Its sales tumbled after China raised tariffs on U.S.-built cars, prompting the automaker to cut prices to keep its models affordable.  In moves which would further lower prices, the automaker has said it aims to produce its Model 3 mass-market car from 2019 at the new plant - Tesla\u2019s first Gigafactory outside of the United States - and localize its manufacturing and supply chain.  Shanghai\u2019s government, in a statement on its official WeChat late on Wednesday, said Mayor Ying Yong had visited the site of the Gigafactory and that preparation work was nearly complete and construction would start soon.  Ying urged the firm to \u201caccelerate\u201d work on the factory and said production would start to some degree in the second half of next year, the statement showed.  A member of the community at Lingang near the plant\u2019s 860,000 square meter site, which Tesla secured in October, said work on ground preparation and fencing appeared nearly complete.  \u201cWorkers work very hard on this,\u201d the person said. \u201cSometimes they work until 10 pm at night.\u201d","1441":"A China-made Tesla Model 3 electric vehicle is seen ahead of the Guangzhou auto show in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, China November 21, 2019.

China\u2019s industry ministry had earlier said Tesla\u2019s Model 3 cars, being built at its $2 billion factory in Shanghai, were on a list recommended for subsidies for new energy vehicles (NEVs), which include plug-in hybrids, battery-only electric vehicles and those powered by hydrogen fuel cells.  Tesla said in a statement the subsidies had been secured.  Two variants of Tesla Model 3 vehicles are on the list for the generous NEV subsidy program, according to the website of China\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.  The California-based electric vehicle maker aims to make more than 1,000 vehicles a week by the end of 2019 for it Shanghai plant and deliver the China-made vehicles before the Chinese new year on Jan. 25.  The annual capacity at the factory in its first phase is expected to reach 250,000 vehicles, equivalent to about 4,800 a week. This will include 150,000 Model 3 cars.  It was not immediately clear how much of a subsidy the vehicles would receive. The starting price for China-made Model 3 cars is 355,800 yuan ($50,550), according to Tesla\u2019s website.  China hopes sales of NEVs which constituted around 4.6% of overall market in 2018, can reach a quarter of car sales in 2025.

Tesla said it earned net income of $104 million from April to June, or $0.50 per share, marking the first time the company has posted a profit for four straight quarters, a condition for it to be considered for the stock index of the largest U.S. companies. (See graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/3hw2RwV)  The performance is a major accomplishment for Chief Executive Elon Musk, whose mission of leading the global auto industry into an electric future has frequently been questioned by investors who doubted Tesla\u2019s viability.  Its shares have gained more than 500% over the past year. Many analysts believe the rally has been fueled in part by expectations of Tesla\u2019s imminent inclusion in the stock index, which would unleash a flood of demand for shares.  Musk on a conference call on Wednesday said Tesla would prioritize growth over profit going forward and focus on making its vehicles more affordable.  \u201cThe thing that bugs me most right now is that our cars are not affordable enough, we need to fix that,\u201d Musk said on the call. \u201cI think we just want to be like slightly profitable and maximize growth and make the cars as affordable as possible.\u201d  The price of a Model 3 sedan, its most popular vehicle, starts at $37,990 in the United States.  Musk also announced that Travis County, Texas, which includes Austin, would be the site of Tesla\u2019s new factory. The area had been competing with Tulsa, Oklahoma, for the new plant, which promises to create at least 5,000 jobs.  Musk said the factory would produce Model 3 and Model Y vehicles for the Eastern United States, as well as a new semi-truck called the Tesla Semi and the carmaker\u2019s futuristic Cybertruck.  FILE PHOTO: A Tesla SuperCharger station is seen in Los Angeles, California, U.S., July 9, 2020. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  Tesla on Wednesday affirmed its goal to deliver at least half a million vehicles by the end of 2020 despite production interruptions, including the shutting of its California factory for nearly six weeks of the quarter on orders of local authorities. The company delivered more than 90,000 vehicles in the second quarter, surpassing analyst expectations.  \u201cWhile achieving this goal has become more difficult, delivering half a million vehicles in 2020 remains our target,\u201d the company said.  Musk said on Wednesday's call that the real limitation to Tesla's growth is battery cell production at an affordable price, and said the company would expand its business with Panasonic Corp 6752.T and China's Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) 300750.SZ.  Tesla will introduce new low-cost, long-life batteries in its Model 3 sedan in China later this year or early next, Reuters reported previously.  Tesla\u2019s second-quarter revenue fell to $6.04 billion from $6.35 billion a year earlier, but surpassed analyst expectations for revenue of $5.37 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Tesla reported $5.18 billion in second-quarter automotive revenue, but its share of income from regulatory credits - payments the company receives from other carmakers to offset emissions - increased to $428 million from $354 million in the first quarter.  That revenue could dry up as more manufacturers develop and sell electric cars, but many rivals are still focused on reaping the high profit margins from fuel-guzzling trucks and SUVs.  \u201cRight now in the EV market, it\u2019s Tesla\u2019s world and everyone else is paying rent, a dynamic shown front and center this quarter,\u201d Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst, said in a note.  Tesla\u2019s rapid rise to become the world\u2019s most valuable carmaker could mark the start of a new era for the global auto industry, defined by a Silicon Valley approach to software that is overtaking old-school manufacturing know-how.  The company said higher income from those regulatory credits in combination with temporary employee salary cuts during the pandemic and $48 million in deferred revenue from its yet-to-be-released self-driving feature offset the cost of factory shutdowns.  Musk on Tuesday qualified for a payout worth an unprecedented $2.1 billion, his second jackpot since May from the electric car maker following its massive stock surge.","1445":"SHANGHAI\/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O has always shown disdain for marketing, with CEO Elon Musk boasting his company does not advertise, instead using the money it would have spent to develop products.  People attend a Tesla performance driving school event at Shanghai International Circuit in Shanghai, China, August 22, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song  But in China, the world\u2019s biggest electric vehicle market where Tesla is gearing up for a major sales push, that tune has started to change as the automaker promotes racing events, showroom parties with DJs and a line of Chinese Tesla stickers for chat apps.  Case in point: Wang Yubo, a 30-year-old marketing executive and Tesla car owner, was invited by the company to burnish his driving skills at a Shanghai racing track this month.  \u201cI learned how to push my Model 3 to its limits,\u201d said Wang, who writes both enthusiastic and critical blogs about Tesla and occasionally races his car with friends.  Tesla is expanding its focus beyond products to service, says Leo Liu, head of the company\u2019s China driving school which aims to teach people \u201cto make full use of their cars\u201d.  It held three such events for auto reporters, social media influencers and a handful of owners in August - one in Beijing and two in Shanghai and plans to expand to other big cities such as Guangzhou and Chengdu.  \u201cWe are also thinking of having more difficult ones on ice tracks in winter this year,\u201d Liu said, adding that more owners will be invited in the future.  While Tesla hasn\u2019t embarked on conventional TV or billboard advertising, the U.S. firm\u2019s China Chief Tom Zhu has been working on strategies this year to boost the brand\u2019s appeal, frequently seeking ideas and opinions from marketing and sales experts, sources familiar with the discussions said.  The sources were not authorized to speak to the media and declined to be identified. Tesla declined to comment.  BIG FACTORY, BIG PLANS  Helping raise his profile in China, Musk is currently visiting the country and on Thursday held a discussion with Alibaba's BABA.N Jack Ma at an AI industry event, although they avoided controversial issues like the U.S.-China trade war.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Tesla\u2019s new efforts to reach customers in China come as the Silicon Valley automaker is preparing to open a big vehicle assembly factory in Shanghai and confront fierce competition in the luxury electric vehicle market it invented.  The firm\u2019s first overseas factory is due to start production by the end of the year and Tesla has said it should be able to build 3,000 Model 3 vehicles a week in its initial phases.  That would translate to nearly four times the number of imported Model 3 vehicles sold in China per month this year, according to figures from research firm LMC Automotive.  The plant is slated to have annual output capacity of 250,000 vehicles after production of the Model Y is added.  \u201cWe have to learn how to manage a larger sales and after-sales system as production is growing to a completely different level,\u201d said one source. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are doing these events now.\u201d  The sources added, however, that Tesla is spending far less than what a conventional carmaker in China would be spending on marketing.  In Tesla\u2019s favor, it has been exporting cars to China since 2014 and remains the benchmark that other automakers in China often compare their electric vehicles to when they advertise.  The launch of the Model 3 for the Chinese market in late February has also gone well, sending Tesla\u2019s China revenue jumping 42% to $1.5 billion in the first half - equivalent to 13.5% of total revenue.  But Tesla in China doesn\u2019t have the headstart in all-electric vehicles that it had in the U.S. market when it debuted the Model S in 2012.  Chinese startup Nio Inc NIO.N sells two premium all-electric SUVs, Jaguar has launched is I-PACE SUV and BMW BMWG.DE has its i3 hatchback and i8 sportscar. By the end of the year, Audi will have two all-electric SUVs on the market while Daimler's DAIGn.DE Mercedes will have one.  The U.S firm also doesn\u2019t expect Musk\u2019s cult status to propel sales to the same extent it does elsewhere, the sources said.  Most Chinese do not have easy access to his Twitter feed followed by nearly 28 million, although Tesla translates some of his less controversial tweets on its Weibo account.  In addition to chat app stickers that express various emotions - a market strategy also used by other automakers - Tesla is partnering with Tencent's 0700.HK QQ Music streaming service in organizing parties with DJs at showrooms.  Both marketing tactics are China-only developments, the sources said.  Social media users have noticed much more activity on Tesla\u2019s Weibo account in recent months while company has also held several roundtables with reporters and internet influencers throughout China since July.  According to sources, executives explained pricing strategy and expansion plans for its charging network and said they wanted to improve communication with the public.  By contrast, in the United States Tesla rarely grants media access to its executives beyond earnings calls and product launches.  \u201cTesla has finally realized the importance of adjusting to China,\u201d said Wang. \u201cGiven time, it will become more mature.\u201d","1446":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - When Tesla Inc announced last month a second round of job cuts to rein in costs, one crucial department was particularly badly hit. The automaker more than halved the division that delivers its electric vehicles to North American customers, two of the laid-off workers said.  Some 150 employees out of a team of about 230 were let go in January at the Las Vegas facility that gets tens of thousands of Model 3s into the hands of U.S. and Canadian buyers, they said, in a sign the company expected the pace of deliveries to significantly slow in the near term.  The cuts, which have not been previously reported, could fuel investor worries that demand for the Model 3 in the United States has tailed off after a large tax break for consumers expired last year and the car remains too expensive for most consumers.  Tesla has said its focus this quarter is on supplying cars to customers waiting in China and Europe.  \u201cThere are not enough deliveries,\u201d one of the former employees told Reuters. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a team because there are not that many cars coming through.\u201d  Delivery of the Model 3 was the company\u2019s key priority in the latter half of 2018, as Tesla tried to supply all buyers wanting the full benefit of the $7,500 U.S. tax credit before it was cut in half at year\u2019s end.  The Model 3 is crucial to Tesla\u2019s plans for long-term profitability. The company aims to post a profit in each quarter this year, based on the expectation that it will sell more Model 3s and continue to cut costs.  Tesla declined to comment on the job reductions in the delivery team. The company still has an undisclosed number of delivery personnel attached to other locations.  \u2018EVERY BEING ON THE PLANET\u2019  Even before the paring back of the delivery team, investors questioned the level of demand for the Model 3 remaining after Tesla\u2019s all-out push to supply buyers ahead of the tax credit cut.  \u201cGiven the need for revenue to cover costs and generate cash, the financial community should be focused on the level of demand for Tesla vehicles \u2013 in particular the Model 3,\u201d wrote Barclays analyst Brian Johnson in January.  FILE PHOTO: Rows of new Tesla Model 3 electric vehicles are seen in Richmond, California. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam\/File Photo  The two former delivery workers said the 2018 sales push has left Tesla\u2019s reservations list plucked clean of North American buyers willing to pay current prices of over $40,000 to get their hands on a Model 3.  Chief Executive Elon Musk initially said in 2016 the car would start at $35,000 - which sparked a rush of reservations - but Tesla has yet to actually sell any cars at that price, despite two price cuts already this year.  \u201cWe sold through just about every car we had on the ground and we called almost every being on the planet who had ever expressed desire to own a Tesla to let them know the tax credit was expiring,\u201d said the other ex-employee.  Tesla workers around the company were reassigned to pitch in, that source said.  \u201cThey said, \u2018Your job is off the table now, we have to get these cars delivered. Because if we don\u2019t get these cars delivered, you don\u2019t have a job tomorrow,\u2019\u201d the former employee said.  HALF A MILLION BUYERS  At the Model 3 launch in July 2017, Musk said over half a million buyers had put down deposits on the new car. That helped send Tesla shares up almost 15 percent over the following six weeks.  The company delivered 145,610 Model 3s in 2018, but all of them at prices far above $35,000. Musk said last week a $35,000 version that could be sold profitably was perhaps six months away. Even with two price cuts this year, the lowest price tag on a Model 3 is now $42,900.  Musk maintains that Model 3 demand is \u201cinsanely high,\u201d but his company has not released any figures to demonstrate that.  Asked about the reservations list last week by analysts, outgoing Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja declined to disclose how many people remained, calling it \u201cnot relevant.\u201d  Musk has said Tesla has multiple ways of stoking demand, if it chose to, such as offering leases or boosting marketing efforts.  The Model 3s now rolling out of Tesla\u2019s Fremont, California, factory are going to Chinese and European buyers, Tesla says.  The two laid-off employees said delivery targets for North America - made up of mostly U.S. buyers - this quarter would be 55 percent to 60 percent of what they were in the last quarter of 2018.  If Tesla does not cut prices soon, it risks losing potential customers - and ones already on its reservation list - to a slew of German and Asian competitors whose electric vehicles will hit the U.S. market this year. Each of the new entrant\u2019s first 200,000 buyers will be eligible for a full federal subsidy.  Having met that number already, the U.S. tax credit for Tesla buyers drops in half to $3,750 for the first six months of 2019, then falls by half again in the second six months.  Musk said last month his \u201crough guess\u201d was that Tesla would begin building the $35,000 Model 3 in mid-2019.  One of the sources said that could recharge U.S. demand: \u201cIf there was a Model 3 for $35,000 that was still a really good car, that blows away the competition, I could see demand going through the roof.\u201d","1447":"One man is pressing on alone with a lawsuit alleging Tesla Inc failed to warn about unintended acceleration defects in its vehicles after five of his former co-plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed similar claims.

FILE PHOTO: A Tesla logo is seen in Los Angeles, California U.S. January 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  And Tesla\u2019s volatile and broadly underperforming stock is one reason why, they said.  Convertible securities feature the income and protections of a low-yielding bond but offer the potential to profit far more from a jump in the stock price that triggers repayment in shares rather than cash.  In the new deal, being sold alongside $650 million in new shares, Tesla is looking to offer an interest rate below the coupon on its previous convertible from two years ago, even though interest rates today are broadly higher. There is also a higher bar for taking advantage of the stock price.  Investors, however, said the new deal in fact looks appealing when compared with Tesla\u2019s existing convertibles, which now feature even leaner yields and, because the stock has been so wobbly, an even lower chance at striking a rich equity conversion before those bonds mature in the next three years.  \u201cWith this new bond, you have five years until the bond is supposed to pay off. They don\u2019t have to be successful, they don\u2019t have to hit a home run. They just have to stay in business to refinance this in five years,\u201d said Geoffrey Dancey, managing partner and portfolio manager at Cutler Capital Management.  The fundraising - which could top $2 billion in total - is easing Wall Street concerns about the carmaker, which has struggled to maintain profitability, and its ability to overcome a drop in sales and build new product lines. Tesla shares, which had fallen by nearly 10% in the two years since its last convertible was sold, ended more than 4% higher on Thursday.  The new convertible bond is seen carrying a coupon of between 1.5% and 2.0% with a conversion premium of between 27.5% and 32.5% over the reference price for Tesla shares at the time of the sale, according to a trader who saw preliminary marketing materials for the deal on Thursday.  While those appear to be poorer terms for investors than the 2.375% coupon on the $977.5 million convertible bond maturing in March 2022, it is superior to the current yield to maturity on that 2022 bond at around 1%, Dancey said.  On its face, the conversion premium being touted, with a midpoint at 30%, also compares unfavorably to the 2022 bond\u2019s lower conversion premium of 25%. But the underperformance of the stock, which closed at $244.10 on Thursday, means holders of the 2022 bond need at least a 34% rise in the stock to a price of$327.50 in order to trigger a conversion.  \u201cThe terms of the convertible look reasonable, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll have any issue selling,\u201d said Dancey, who may buy some of the new bonds. He does not have an existing position.  Another boost to demand could come from the legion of short sellers of Tesla shares who often buy convertibles as a hedge, a common arbitrage used by hedge funds, said Eli Pars, co-chief investment officer at Calamos Investments. More than 25% of Tesla\u2019s public float of stock is sold short.  \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything that would make me think this would have any trouble getting done,\u201d Pars said. Calamos has positions in convertibles from both Tesla and its solar panel-making unit, Solar City, according to its most recent SEC filing.  \u201cWith convertible bonds there are many opportunities for things to turn out OK,\u201d he said.  Ross Gerber, chief executive of investment manager Gerber Kawasaki, known for his bullish positions on Tesla said the \u201cnoise\u201d surrounding Tesla - including Chief Executive Elon Musk\u2019s recent court fight with the SEC over his tweets - had rattled some of his clients.  \u201cWhen we build a portfolio, Tesla will be a part of it. But what we\u2019ll probably be doing is adding more on the convertible side not on the equity side,\u201d he said.","1449":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of car manufacturer Tesla is seen at a branch office in Bern, Switzerland October 28, 2020.

The company headed by billionaire Elon Musk on Monday will become the most valuable ever admitted to Wall Street\u2019s main benchmark, accounting for over 1% of the index. The shares have surged some 70% since mid-November, when its debut in the S&P 500 was announced, and have soared 700% so far in 2020.  Tesla\u2019s shares ended up 6% at a record $695.  Tesla\u2019s addition to the S&P 500 is forcing index-tracking funds to buy about $85 billion worth of the shares by the end of Friday\u2019s session so that their portfolios reflect the index, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Those funds simultaneously have to sell other S&P 500 constituents\u2019 shares worth the same amount.  Shares swung between gains and losses late in the session before surging in price and volume near the end of trading.  The move was likely a result of last-minute buying in preparation for its addition to the S&P 500, said Dennis Dick, proprietary trader at Bright Trading in Las Vegas.  Turnover in Tesla shares topped $120 billion shortly after 4 p.m. EST (2100 GMT), with volume exceeding 200 million as the stock traded after hours, according to Refinitiv data. Trading volume for Tesla has averaged 53 million shares over the past 10 sessions.  \u201cThat kind of volume is just sort of insane,\u201d Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas, said of Friday\u2019s action.  Tesla shares were falling in after-hours trading, last down 3%.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Tesla\u2019s inclusion may be a double-edged sword for index trackers, who are buying its volatile shares after this year\u2019s massive run-up.  \u201cIndex-based funds will be paying a higher price than those that bought the stock when the entry date was announced, but will benefit as the fund better represents the U.S. large-cap universe,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. \u201cTesla\u2019s absence in the prominent index has been notable in 2020.\u201d  Some strategists expect Tesla\u2019s inclusion to ripple through the S&P 500 itself. Tesla is a \u201cvolatile stock,\u201d noted Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist with Ally Invest, moving an average of 4.1% a day in 2020.  Others, however, say Tesla\u2019s addition is unlikely to exacerbate gyrations in the broader index. Had the stock been included in the S&P 500 all year, it would have increased implied volatility on the benchmark index by only a small amount, according to a study by UBS strategist Stuart Kaiser.  Actively managed funds that benchmark their performance against the S&P 500, many of which until now have avoided investing in one of Wall Street\u2019s most controversial stocks, will also be forced to decide whether to own Tesla.  \u201cEveryone has known this is coming for two or three weeks, so the real question now is if it continues to be an outperformer and, if so, then what is the catalyst,\u201d said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC in New York.  California-based Tesla\u2019s stock surge has put its market value at about $660 billion, making it the sixth most valuable publicly listed U.S. company with many investors viewing it as wildly overvalued.  Tesla is by far the most traded stock by value on Wall Street, with $18 billion worth of its shares exchanged on average in each session over the past 12 months, easily beating Apple, in second place with average daily trades of $14 billion, according to Refinitiv.  About a fifth of Tesla\u2019s shares are closely held by Musk, the chief executive, and other insiders. Since the S&P 500 is weighted by the amount of companies\u2019 shares actually available on the stock market, Tesla\u2019s influence within the benchmark will be slightly diminished compared with its overall value.","1451":"OSLO (Reuters) - New electric car sales in Norway rose by a third last year amid soaring demand for Tesla Inc's TSLA.O vehicles, but the pioneering U.S. company will face a more competitive market in 2020 as rivals prepare to launch new electric models.  An electric Mustang Mach-E car is displayed during its launch in Oslo, Norway November 18, 2019. REUTERS\/Lefteris Karagiannopoulos  Fully electric cars made up 42.4% of sales in the Nordic country last year, a global record, rising from a 31.2% market share in 2018 and just 5.5% in 2013, the Norwegian Road Federation said on Friday.  Norway, which is Europe\u2019s biggest oil and gas producer, is seeking to become the first country to end the sale of fossil-fueled cars by 2025. The country has exempted battery-powered vehicles from the taxes imposed on petrol and diesel engines and after just a few years the streets of Oslo have become quieter and have less air pollution.  Most of Norway's top-10 cars in 2019 were electric, including Volkswagen's Golf VOWG_p.DE, Nissan's 7201.T Leaf, Audi's NSUG.DE e-tron, BMW's BMWG.DE i3, Jaguar's I-PACE and several of Hyundai's 005380.KS models.  New car sales in the country last year were 142,381, of which 60,316 were fully electric. This year, as many as six in 10 of all new cars sold in the country could be fully electric, said Volkswagen (VW) distributor Harald A. Moeller AS, which is preparing to launch several models in 2020.  Other importers predicted the market share in 2020 would be in a range of 50-60% of all sales.  \u201cThe electrification of the car market is accelerating ... we forecast electric vehicles to hold a 100% market share in 2025,\u201d Volkswagen said of the outlook for Norway.  The country\u2019s best-selling car in 2019 was Tesla\u2019s mid-sized Model 3 sedan, which retails from 384,900 Norwegian crowns ($43,721.74), racking up an 11% market share in the California-based firm\u2019s first attempt at cracking the mass market.  Rising global awareness of climate change has encouraged a shift in regulation, technology and consumer preferences, disrupting the auto industry and boosting Tesla\u2019s share price to make it one of the world\u2019s most highly valued car brands.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  This year, the company will start producing a medium-sized sport utility vehicle, the Model Y, but faces competition from a plethora of rivals, including by Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz, VW's Audi and Ford Motor Co F.N.  \u201cThere will be between 20 and 30 new electric models on the market in 2020, many of them launching early in the year,\u201d the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association said in a statement.  Ford late last year unveiled the Mustang Mach-E SUV, which it hopes will help turn around its flagging fortunes.  \u201cIt will compete with Tesla\u2019s models 3 and Y. I also think Audi e-tron is a big competitor. The customers have waited for this car for over two years,\u201d said Kjetil Hagestande, chief executive of Ford importer RoehneSelmer.  \u201cThis amazing car with four-wheel drive and long range fits the Norway market perfectly,\u201d Hagestande told Reuters on the sidelines of the Mach-E launch in November.  Also aiming for a slice of Norway\u2019s market is China\u2019s Geely [GEELY.UL] group, whose Polestar and Volvo brands will begin producing fully electric cars this year.  In October, Polestar opened its first European showroom in Oslo\u2019s most upmarket shopping district, rubbing shoulders with fashion designers rather than with rival auto makers.  \u201cI\u2019m here to consider a new car because my wife already has her second electric car, a Hyundai,\u201d said Espen Cook, a retired IT worker, on a recent visit to the Polestar venue.  \u201cTwo months ago I sold my hybrid Lexus so I would like to go full electric,\u201d the 70-year-old told Reuters.  ($1 = 8.8034 Norwegian crowns)","1452":"(Reuters) - Shares in Tesla Inc TSLA.O fell just under 3 percent on Monday after Chief Executive Elon Musk abandoned his plan to take the electric carmaker private, with analysts saying the company needed new blood among senior management to prop up its standing with investors.  The billionaire entrepreneur said in a blog post late on Friday that consultations, done with the help of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, had shown most of Tesla\u2019s existing shareholders opposed the deal that he proposed on Twitter three weeks ago to widespread shock on Wall Street.  \u201cWe are hopeful that ... the past 17 days will lead the Board down the path to bringing on a more operational CEO or at a minimum a COO,\u201d Cowen and Co analysts said in a note to clients.  Tesla\u2019s shares, already down nearly 15 percent from a peak on Aug. 7 when Musk tweeted that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d for a buyout at $420 a share, initially fell more than 5 percent in European and premarket trading in New York.  They recovered, however, to stand down just 2.8 percent lower at $314 by 8.30 e.t..  Notes from Wall Street analysts questioned Musk\u2019s credibility going forward in the face of a possible investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission into the factual accuracy of an Aug. 7 tweet that funding for the buyout deal was \u201csecured\u201d.  \u201cMusk\u2019s involvement in the company is critical, but now more than ever a solid #2 - someone with strong operational background that can help Tesla move from ideas to execution - is crucial,\u201d analyst Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets wrote in a client note.  Tesla said on Sunday it was not searching for a chief operating officer.  \u201cWhile we are always looking for highly talented executives (...) there is no active COO search,\u201d a spokesman said by email.  FILE PHOTO: Tesla superchargers are installed at the Quinte Mall in Belleville, Ontario, Canada, May 6, 2018. REUTERS\/David Lucas\/File Photo  With Musk\u2019s idea for a buyout backed by Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund now off the table, attention was zeroing in on Tesla\u2019s efforts to become profitable, its cash reserves and what steps Musk could take to raise fresh capital.  Tesla had $2.78 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter, after a record $718 million loss.  In early August, before the buyout plan was made public, Tesla reiterated a forecast that it would achieve a profit in the third and fourth quarters, under normal accounting rules, and Musk said the company would not need to raise more cash.  A Tesla spokesman on Sunday also referred back to those previous comments.  \u201cWith its long term mission intact but short term growth shaky, serious gaps in execution skills and a board under pressure for not assuming its duties, now may be the time for third parties to get involved, be it from technology or even oil,\u201d Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois told clients.  One of Tesla\u2019s biggest challenges is ramping up production of its latest vehicle, the Model 3, which is critical to its profitability goals.  Monday\u2019s fall would still leave shares in the company 27 percent above a low of $244.59 hit on April 2, a day before the electric carmaker released its production and Model 3 deliveries report for the first quarter.  TAPPING CAPITAL MARKETS  Investors in Tesla\u2019s bonds and convertible debt had also already shown skepticism that the tens of billions of dollars needed for the buyout would materialize, unconvinced by Musk\u2019s tweet or subsequent blog post in which he could only make the case for going private and not list clear backing.  Analysts have suggested a capital raise may be required soon to boost investor confidence but investment bankers who are not working for the company said over the weekend it would also contradict Musk\u2019s promise that Tesla is adequately funded.  This week would also be an inopportune time for a capital raising, given that many bankers and investors are away ahead of the Sept. 3 Labor Day holiday.  \u201cWe see the company raising $2 billion in 4Q18, through convertible debt, which may prove a challenge if there still is an ongoing SEC case open,\u201d Cowen and Co analyst Jeffrey Osborne wrote in a client note.  The high price investors have put on Tesla\u2019s shares has allowed Musk to expand U.S. production, invest in building out a vehicle charging network and start work on new models including a small sport utility vehicle, a new Roadster and a semi-truck even as the company burned cash.  Tesla earlier this year announced plans to build a battery and vehicle assembly complex in China. Musk said earlier this month that the company\u2019s \u201cdefault plan\u201d would be to fund that expansion by borrowing money from Chinese banks.","1453":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla shares extended their recent sell-off on Wednesday after Citi cut its price target on the struggling electric car maker, leaving buyers of its recent share offer, including Chief Executive Elon Musk, $175 million in the hole.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Tesla\u2019s stock dropped 5.5% to $193.88, on track to close below $200 for the first time since late 2016. It has lost a fifth of its value since the company sold a $1.84 billion convertible bond and almost $900 million of stock on May 2 to raise fresh capital and give it more time to stop losing money.  Citi analyst Itay Michaeli, who has a \u201csell\u201d rating on Tesla, cut his price target to $191 from $238. He pointed to a an email Musk sent to employees last week, telling them he would increase cost-cutting, and that the $2.7 billion in recently raised capital would give Tesla just 10 months to break even at the rate it burned cash in the first quarter.  \u201cThe recent reported internal memo, which seemingly called into question prior guidance, didn\u2019t help the risk\/reward calculus. The implications can be serious, since an automaker\u2019s balance sheet is always subject to the confidence \u2018spiral\u2019 risk,\u201d Michaeli wrote in a client note.  Consumer Reports warned on Wednesday that a recent update to Tesla\u2019s Autopilot driver assistance software does not work well and could be unsafe.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear to react to brake lights or turn signals, it can\u2019t anticipate what other drivers will do, and as a result, you constantly have to be one step ahead of it,\u201d Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports\u2019 senior director of auto testing, said in a news release.  Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On April 22, Musk told investors here that driverless Tesla \u201crobotaxis\u201d would be available in some U.S. markets next year, a claim met by skepticism by some self-driving experts.  UPPING HIS STAKE  Musk is battling to convince investors that demand remains high for the Model 3, the sedan targeted to propel Tesla to sustainable profit, and that it can be delivered efficiently and swiftly to customers around the world. Tesla lost $702 million in the first quarter and warned that profit would be delayed until the latter half of the year.  On Monday, Musk exercised options to buy 175,000 Tesla shares at $31.17 per share, increasing his indirect stake in the company to 34,102,560 shares, according to a filing. With Tesla\u2019s stock down 41% year to date, Musk\u2019s shares, including 102,880 he bought in this month\u2019s capital raise, were worth $6.6 billion on Wednesday.  Tesla\u2019s debt has stalled at lows hit earlier this week. Its recently issued convertible bond due in 2024 priced at 89.09 cents on the dollar, a record low. Its $1.8 billion junk bond traded at 82.5 cents on the dollar, slightly up from the all-time lows it hit on Monday and Tuesday.  The cost to insure Tesla\u2019s debt, as measured by its credit default swap, edged up to roughly 28% of the face value of Tesla\u2019s 2025 bond, from 27.6 % the day before.","1454":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Tesla Inc is gearing up for an India launch but the U.S. electric carmaker is likely to remain a niche player for years, catering only to the rich and affluent in the world\u2019s second-most populous nation.  FILE PHOTO: The interior of a Tesla Model 3 electric vehicle is shown in this picture illustration taken in Moscow, Russia July 23, 2020. Picture taken July 23, 2020. REUTERS\/Evgenia Novozhenina  India\u2019s fledgling electric vehicle (EV) market accounted for only 5,000 out of a total 2.4 million cars sold in the country last year. A lack of local production of components and batteries, negligible charging infrastructure and the high cost of EVs mean there have been few takers in the price-conscious market.  It\u2019s also difficult to see how Tesla\u2019s sought-after and expensive autonomous driving features will work on India\u2019s congested roads.  Ammar Master, a forecaster at consultancy LMC Automotive, said he expects Tesla to annually sell only 50-100 of its Model 3 electric sedans in India, at least in the first five years.  \u201cAs a country, India is still not so environmentally conscious to pay that much of a premium,\u201d Master said.  \u201cIt always comes down to the price point. There will be some high net-worth individuals like movie stars and top business executives who will look at it for the brand value. But then, how many buyers are there?\u201d  The world\u2019s most valuable automobile manufacturer registered a local company in India earlier this month, a step towards its entry in the country, expected to be as early as mid-2021.  Tesla plans to import and sell the Model 3 in India for around $65,000-$75,000 - roughly double the price in the U.S. market, sources familiar with the plans said.  This means it will compete in India\u2019s even smaller luxury EV segment that has recently started seeing interest from the likes of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and Daimler\u2019s Mercedes Benz.  The Mercedes Benz EQC, India\u2019s first luxury EV launched in October for $136,000, and has since sold 31 units, according to auto researcher JATO Dynamics. British luxury carmarker JLR, owned by India\u2019s Tata Motors, plans to launch its I-PACE EV before March. It sells in the United States for around $70,000.  Although India\u2019s road infrastructure has improved in recent years, traffic discipline - like lane driving - is still rudimentary. Auto analysts say that means many of Tesla\u2019s features like the automatic lane changing function will be tough to deploy on crowded Indian streets.  Stray animals, including cattle, and potholes on the road are a further problem.  \u201cMost of Tesla\u2019s high technology features will be redundant and users will not get the bang for the buck despite paying premium prices\u201d, said Ravi Bhatia, president for India at JATO Dynamics.  LOCAL PRODUCTION  Rohan Patel, a senior public policy executive at Tesla in the United States, is among those leading efforts around its India launch, the sources familiar with the plans said. The EV giant is looking to hire 15-20 people mainly for sales and marketing, one source said.  Tesla and Patel did not respond to a request for comment.  India has some of the world\u2019s most polluted cities and wants more clean cars on its roads, but the federal government still does not have a comprehensive policy like China which mandates carmakers to invest in the segment.  One reason is that auto manufacturers have pushed back saying there is no demand for EVs in India as costs of components like batteries remain high, and push up prices.  And Tesla CEO Elon Musk has himself expressed concern about India\u2019s high import taxes on cars.  In contrast to India, China sold 1.25 million new energy passenger vehicles, including EVs, in 2020 out of total sales of 20 million.  Tesla is a major player in China, which last year accounted for more than a third of the carmaker\u2019s global sales, according to JATO Dynamics, and where it also has a factory.  Daniel Ives of U.S.-based Wedbush Securities said however that within 7-8 years, India could account for 5% of Tesla\u2019s total sales. The key to success, however, will be local manufacturing, he said.  \u201cIt is a matter of when, not if, they build out a factory in India,\u201d said Ives, adding that building out a local supply chain will be a multi-year effort.  \u201cIndia is a potential sweet spot and Tesla does not want to be late to the game.\u201d","1455":"FILE PHOTO: A Tesla car is seen in Santa Monica, California, United States, October 23, 2018.

FILE PHOTO: Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory groundbreaking ceremony in Shanghai, China January 7, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  After unveiling a $700 million loss in the first quarter, Musk conceded on Wednesday evening that he needed to pull in more capital for the car world\u2019s highest profile venture of recent years.  Seven Wall Street brokerages asked by Reuters said they expected Musk to tap investors for between $1 billion and $3 billion in the near future.  The results also stressed the company\u2019s paying off of $920 million in existing debt in the first quarter, but bond yields in the company surged on the news, while shares fell, as investors began to price in what that might cost.  In European trading before the start of the U.S. business day, investors were already demanding a record risk premium for holding Tesla\u2019s $1.8 billion junk bond, pushing the yield on the 5.3 percent note due in August 2025 to the highest in six months at 8.51 percent.  Tesla shares, already down more than 20 percent this year, dipped 1.4 percent to $255.13 in early trade.  After months of uncertainty following Musk\u2019s swiftly retracted claim last summer that he was set to take the company private, and a series of failures to meet production targets, they said the cost of new capital would now be far higher than a year ago.  \u201cObviously, investors would have appreciated that confession (to raise capital) when the shares were higher, the fundamental performance better and Elon Musk less erratic,\u201d Evercore analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said in a note.  Tesla\u2019s first quarter results disappointed both in terms of sales and a sharp drop in the number of vehicles delivered to global customers, and there was scepticism over promises of a return to profitability in the third quarter.  \u201cUltimately we believe the company\u2019s guidance is aggressive,\u201d analysts from Wedbush Securities said in a note to clients.  Musk has long resisted the need to raise capital, but he told a conference call with analysts it was now the right time.  Several analysts covering the company argued Tesla needed to simplify operations.  \u201cFor investors we think the question is whether or not people want to put capital into Tesla for Robo taxis and autonomous when Uber or Lyft or Nvidia could end up being better alternatives,\u201d Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin wrote.  \u201cWe don\u2019t think Tesla would need to raise capital as urgently if they weren\u2019t spending so much money on these initiatives outside of their core mission of producing awesome EV\u2019s\u201d.  CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson said Tesla\u2019s timing \u2013 with the stock down more than 22 percent year-to-date \u2013 is quite inopportune to raise capital and that Tesla should have completed an equity issuance months ago.","1460":"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)  NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Reuters) - A pair of offshore hedge funds that claim to have lost more than $15 million to cover short positions in Tesla have asked for court approval to lead consolidated private securities fraud litigation against the carmaker.  The Tempus International Fund and the Opportunity Unique Fund, which are both managed by Brazil\u2019s Opportunity Gest\u00e3o de Investimentos e Recursos Ltda, were among more than a dozen Tesla investors to file motions Tuesday night in federal court in San Francisco, where U.S. District Judge Edward Chen is overseeing lawsuits alleging that Tesla CEO Elon Musk deceived shareholders when he tweeted on Aug. 7 that he had secured funding to take the company private at $420 per share.  As Tesla shares spiked following Musk\u2019s tweet, Tempus bought more than 150,000 shares and OUF bought more than 11,000 to cover short positions. The two funds, which are represented by the shareholders\u2019 firm Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer, claim to have lost more money in their Tesla purchases than any of the other hedge funds and individual investors bidding to lead the litigation against Tesla.  Tesla short-sellers Andrew Left and Vilas Capital also asked Judge Chen to appoint them as lead shareholders in the investor case, which will proceed as a class action on behalf of all Tesla shareholders.  Left and Vilas are part of an investor group claiming losses of more than $4.5 million. That group, which is represented by Labaton Sucharow and Keller Lenkner, also includes investors who held long positions in Tesla but lost money as the shares spiked on Musk\u2019s tweet and declined as doubt set in about the going-private transaction.  Tesla is represented in the private securities litigation by Fenwick & West. Fenwick partner Dean Kristy did not respond to an email requesting comment on the lead shareholder candidates.  Tesla and Musk neither admitted nor denied liability in their settlement with the SEC. The company will almost certainly argue that investors cannot prove Musk intended to deceive them in his Aug. 7 tweets and that he had a reasonable basis to believe he was being truthful.  BIGGEST LOSSES GET TO LEAD  The law governing private shareholder litigation in the U.S. instructs federal judges to give heavy weight to the magnitude of investors\u2019 losses when selecting a lead investor to run the class action. Congress reasoned that investors with a big stake in the outcome of the case are best positioned to make decisions on behalf of all shareholders.  Securities fraud class actions seek damages on behalf of all investors, but lead shareholders and their lawyers frame the case, decide when and whether to settle investors\u2019 claims and shape the ultimate allocation of damages. For shareholders\u2019 lawyers, appointment to serve as lead counsel means the chance to earn big fees if the case settles.  Lawyers say the lead investor in the Tesla case will have a particularly important role because many nontraditional investors such as short-sellers and options traders held positions in the company. The lead shareholder and its lawyers must represent the interests of those different constituencies if Tesla eventually agrees to a settlement.  Hedge funds have been reluctant, historically, to lead shareholder class actions. But plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers told me earlier this month, after Tesla and Musk reached a $40 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, that the SEC deal might force funds off of the fence.  \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to be an instigator,\u201d Travis Lenkner of Keller Lenkner said at the time. \u201cThere\u2019s a different public profile if you\u2019re acting after a government regulator has already said there\u2019s misconduct and reached a settlement.\u201d  In addition to the offshore funds that lost more than $15 million and the funds in the Andrew Left group, FNY Investment Advisers and Hong Kong\u2019s Bridgestone Investment Corporation also asked Judge Chen to appoint them to lead the case.  FNY did not specify its losses in Tesla shares. Bridgestone claimed losses of $3.9 million. Individual Tesla investors and investor groups with losses ranging from about $330,000 to $3.5 million also submitted motions to be appointed lead.  Tempus International and OUF are the presumptive favorites to lead the Tesla case because of their big alleged losses. But other candidates will now have an opportunity to oppose the funds\u2019 motion. Such challenges could focus on the funds\u2019 methodology for calculating their losses or their ability to represent the interests of all Tesla investors.  Judges overseeing securities class actions are sometimes reluctant to appoint groups of investors as lead shareholders because of concerns that the groups have been assembled by lawyers. The Left\/Vilas group tried to dampen those concerns in a joint declaration from the members of the group. The investors said they and their lawyers came up with the idea of banding together.  \u201cBased upon our own diligence and communications, we agreed that a small group of sophisticated investors, covering long, short, equity, and options positions, together, represented the best possible structure to achieve the maximum results in this litigation for ourselves and similarly situated investors,\u201d the declaration said.

REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  BEIJING (Reuters) - Tesla Inc sold 10,160 vehicles in China in March, its highest ever monthly sales in the world\u2019s largest auto market, the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) said on Thursday.  Tesla, which aims to produce 150,000 Model 3 sedans from its $2 billion Shanghai factory, sold around 30% of the battery electric vehicles sold in China, Cui Dongshu, CPCA secretary general, said on an online briefing.  Tesla sold around 3,900 units in February, up from 2,620 vehicles in January, CPCA data showed. CPCA uses a different counting method than Tesla\u2019s deliveries.  Overall passenger car sales in March were down 40.8% from a year earlier.","1462":"(Adds photos available)  NEW YORK, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Some nimble traders in Tesla Inc\u2019s options made massive paper profits on Tuesday, while short-sellers were hit with about $1.3 billion in paper losses after Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted he was considering taking the company private at $420 a share.  Musk has been under pressure to prove he can deliver on his promise to turn his money-losing company into a profitable higher-volume manufacturer of electric vehicles. Tesla shares rose as much as 13 percent before ending the day up 11 percent.  The tweet spurred a rush of trading in Tesla\u2019s options, driving volume to 500,000 contracts, more than twice the daily average, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.  Call options, which convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future, were particularly busy and logged significant price gains on the day.  One block of 714 Tesla call options, betting on the shares rising above $365 by the end of the week, were bought for 85 cents, for a total outlay of $60,690. Just hours later they were worth $1.3 million on paper.  Other near-dated bullish contracts also registered sharp gains.  The contracts were bought minutes after the Financial Times, citing unnamed people with direct knowledge of the matter, reported Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund has built a significant stake in Tesla.  The rally after Musk\u2019s tweet unleashed fresh pain for short-sellers in Tesla, the most shorted U.S. stock, according to financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners.  Short-sellers, who had been saddled with sharp losses earlier this month after Tesla shares soared following quarterly results, suffered paper losses of about $1.3 billion and were now $3.03 billion in the red for the year, according to S3.  \u201cTesla\u2019s volatility makes it more of a trading stock than a value play,\u201d said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 in New York.  \u201cBoth longs and shorts are susceptible to wild price moves which can easily swing a trader\u2019s book from profit to loss in a single day, which may be the reason they are in the name in the first place,\u201d he said.  If the share price rises to the buyout price of $420 and the number of shares sold short does not change, year-to-date paper losses could swell to $4.45 billion, according to S3.  That could lead to a short squeeze - where bearish traders are forced to buy shares to avoid big losses, pushing the stock higher - Dusaniwsky said.","1463":"OSLO, March 22 (Reuters) - Norway\u2019s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world\u2019s largest, opposed Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk\u2019s compensation package in Wednesday\u2019s shareholder vote, the fund said on its website.  Owners of the electric car company approved the compensation package, potentially worth $2.6 billion, though by a lower margin than U.S. CEOs typically receive on pay votes.  The Norwegian fund, which at the start of 2018 owned 0.48 percent of Tesla\u2019s shares, worth $252.5 million, did not say why it voted against Musk\u2019s package. In the past, the fund has said it would work for an overhaul of executive pay. (Reporting by Terje Solsvik, editing by Camilla Knudsen)"}}
