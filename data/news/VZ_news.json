In March, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said major wireless and internet providers - including Verizon, Comcast Corp, AT&T Inc and Alphabet\u2019s Google Fiber - had agreed not to terminate service for subscribers for 60 days. In total, more than 700 companies have now agreed to the voluntary measures. In March, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said carriers had also agreed to open wifi hotspots to anyone who needs them.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Verizon should pay to \u201csolve the patent licensing issue,\u201d a Huawei intellectual property licensing executive wrote in February, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier. The patents cover network equipment for more than 20 of the company\u2019s vendors including major U.S. tech firms but those vendors would indemnify Verizon, the person said. Some of those firms have been approached directly by Huawei, the person said.  The patents in question range from core network equipment, wireline infrastructure to internet-of-things technology, the Journal reported. The licensing fees for the more than 230 patents sought is more than $1 billion, the person said.  Huawei has been battling the U.S. government for more than a year. National security experts worry that \u201cback doors\u201d in routers, switches and other Huawei equipment could allow China to spy on U.S. communications. Huawei has denied that it would help China spy.  Companies involved, including Verizon have notified the U.S. government and the dispute comes amid a growing feud between China and the United States. The licensing fee demand may be more about the geopolitical battle between China and the United States rather than a demand for patent fees.  Huawei and Verizon representatives met in New York last week to discuss some of the patents at issue and whether Verizon is using equipment from other companies that could infringe on Huawei patents.  Verizon spokesman Rich Young declined to comment \u201cregarding this specific issue because it\u2019s a potential legal matter.\u201d  However, Young said, \u201cThese issues are larger than just Verizon. Given the broader geopolitical context, any issue involving Huawei has implications for our entire industry and also raise national and international concerns.\u201d  Huawei and U.S. wireless carriers T-Mobile US Inc and AT&T Inc did not respond to Reuters\u2019 requests for comment. Sprint Corp declined to comment.  The United States last month put Huawei on a blacklist that barred it from doing business with U.S. companies on security grounds without government approval, prompting some global tech firms to cut ties with the world\u2019s largest telecoms equipment maker.  Washington is also seeking the extradition of Huawei Chief Financial Executive Meng Wanzhou from Canada after her arrest in Vancouver last December on a U.S. warrant.  China has since upped the pressure on Canada, halting Canadian canola imports and in May suspended the permits of two major pork producers.","2":"Feb 27 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc:  * VERIZON AND CONCACAF KICK OFF EXCLUSIVE MULTI-PLATFORM MEDIA PARTNERSHIP  * ADDITIONAL TERMS OF DEAL WERE NOT DISCLOSED  * DEAL GIVES VERIZON EXCLUSIVE ENGLISH LANGUAGE RIGHTS TO DISTRIBUTE MULTIPLE CONFEDERATION CHAMPIONSHIPS  * DEAL TO DISTRIBUTE CONFEDERATION OF NORTH, CENTRAL AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL (CONCACAF) TOURNAMENTS ACROSS CO\u2019S DIGITAL MEDIA PLATFORMS  * PEOPLE IN CANADA, MEXICO AND CARIBBEAN WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO VIEW SELECT CONCACAF TOURNAMENTS ON CO\u2019S DIGITAL PLATFORMS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","3":"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N withdrew its full-year revenue outlook on Friday as it lost 68,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill in the first quarter amid lockdowns due to coronavirus outbreak that closed 70% of its stores.

VerizonMedia revenues were $1.7 billion, down 4.0 percent year over year. The company said that it saw more readers on its media platforms, but advertising rates have declined.

The suit sought an unspecified amount of compensation and ongoing royalty payments.  Verizon on Thursday called the lawsuits \u201cnothing more than a PR stunt\u201d and \u201ca sneak attack on our company and the entire tech ecosystem.\u201d  Huawei said in a statement it \u201cis simply asking that Verizon respect Huawei\u2019s investment in research and development by either paying for the use of our patents, or refraining from using them in its products and services.\u201d  Verizon\u2019s statement said: \u201cHuawei\u2019s real target is not Verizon; it is any country or company that defies it. The action lacks merit, and we look forward to vigorously defending ourselves.\u201d  Huawei alleged Verizon has \u201cprofited greatly\u201d from its technology. It said the U.S. company\u2019s Wireline segment, which covers voice, data and video communications products, generated revenue of $29.8 billion in 2018.  Huawei and Verizon held six face-to-face meetings over the matter since February last year, according to the lawsuits. Huawei said it met with Verizon in New York on Jan. 21 \u201cbut there was no substantial progress and thus no licensing agreement was reached.\u201d  Huawei said Verizon is providing access to infringing technologies and services that use Huawei patented technology, \u201csuch as Cisco Integrated Service Routers, Aggregation Services Routers, Network Convergence Systems, Nexus Switches, Catalyst Switches, and Clouds Services Router 1000v series, which facilitate communications throughout Verizon\u2019s networks.\u201d  In June, Reuters reported Huawei told Verizon it should pay licensing fees for use of more than 230 Huawei patents and was seeking more than $1 billion.  The Chinese company decided to take action for 12 patents because it considered evidence clearest and that number was manageable for the litigation, a person told Reuters.  Huawei in December also sued the U.S. Federal Communications Commission after the FCC designated the company a security threat, which Huawei denies, and barred it from a government subsidy program.  Huawei has received more than $1.4 billion in patent license fees since 2015 and paid over $6 billion for use of patented technology, the company said.","7":"June 25 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc said on Thursday it was pausing advertising on Facebook Inc following wide spread support for a campaign that called out the social media giant for not doing enough to stop hate speech on its platforms.  \u201cWe\u2019re pausing our advertising until Facebook can create an acceptable solution that makes us comfortable,\u201d a Verizon spokesperson said.

FILE PHOTO: A man stands next to the logo of Verizon at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 26, 2019. REUTERS\/Sergio Perez  The move puts Disney+, which will debut on Nov. 12 in the United States, close to the size of Netflix\u2019s 61 million paying U.S. subscribers.  Disney shares rose 1.7% to close at $132.55, and Verizon was barely changed at $60.76 on the New York Stock Exchange. Netflix Inc shares fell 4.3% to $266.03 on Nasdaq.  Disney vs Netflix as streaming war looms:  Verizon said all its new and existing unlimited wireless customers, as well as new Fios and 5G Home internet customers, will be eligible for a free, one-year subscription to Disney+. The service will cost regular subscribers $7 monthly or $70 annually. A bundle that includes ESPN+ and Hulu will cost $13 a month.  Disney will be paid by Verizon in a \u201cwholesale\u201d deal arrangement, Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger said in a CNBC interview. The agreement \u201cwill have a significant effect ... in terms of jumpstarting subscriptions,\u201d he added.  As of the second quarter, Verizon served 118 million wireless subscribers, with about half of them purchasing unlimited service, the company has said.  Verizon and Disney are taking a page out of Apple Inc\u2019s playbook by giving a free year\u2019s worth of the video service, to quickly build a subscriber base.  Apple plans to give away a one-year subscription here to Apple TV+ for all purchasers of new Macs, iPhones and Apple TV devices. The service is set to launch on Nov. 1.  Analysts estimate Apple could sell as many as 200 million of its latest iPhones to existing users upgrading their old phones.  The Verizon deal gives Disney an advantage in the so-called streaming wars, in which companies like Netflix, Amazon.com Inc, Comcast Corp and AT&T Inc compete for streaming video subscribers.  Analysts at research firm Cowen noted that Verizon recently reduced the price of its unlimited plans by $5 per month to encourage customer uptake in preparation for 5G.  Fewer than half of Verizon\u2019s customers are on unlimited plans, Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said on the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call.  Verizon had 124 million customers across wireless and Fios internet in the second quarter.  The move by Disney and Verizon puts added pressure on AT&T, which is announcing details of its forthcoming HBO Max streaming service at an investor day presentation on Oct. 29. AT&T has not yet released pricing or distribution details for the new service.  Last year, Verizon shut down its go90 advertising-supported streaming video service after a three-year run, after failing to reach younger viewers.

In a letter to Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon dated June 15 and released by Wyden\u2019s office on Tuesday, Verizon said it was beginning the process to stop selling customer location data to vendors that aggregate the data.

A Securus spokesman said the company was authorized to give law enforcement the location of a phone in certain circumstances, under Securus\u2019 contract with the third party data aggregator.  \u201cWe believe that ending the ability of law enforcement to use these critical tools will hurt public safety and put Americans at risk,\u201d the spokesman said.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The two companies said in a statement they would unveil a prototype, using Qualcomm Inc\u2019s modem chips, at the chipmaker\u2019s annual Snapdragon Technology Summit in Maui, Hawaii this week.  While Verizon is leading the charge to trial 5G in some cities next year, industry analysts say the higher-speed networks are unlikely to be widely available until the middle of the next decade.  Apple is engaged in a legal battle with Qualcomm that has led it to stop using its modem chips, and the Cupertino, California company is widely expected instead to use Intel modems, which will not be ready for production until late 2019.  Citing sources familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported on Monday that Apple would wait until at least 2020 to release its first 5G iPhones.  The delay could make it easier for Samsung and Verizon to win customers who are eager to connect to 5G networks, which will provide a leap forward in mobile data speeds, up to 50 or 100 times faster than current 4G networks.  Qualcomm has also partnered with other smartphone makers who have committed to 5G phones for next year.  U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp is also working with LG Electronics USA to launch a 5G smartphone in the U.S. in the first half of 2019.  Verizon launched its first commercial 5G service in October when its 5G Home offering went live in Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles and Sacramento.

The telecommunications regulator said the settlement resolved an investigation into allegations that Straight Path failed to use the spectrum it was awarded, and in doing so violated the FCC\u2019s rules in connection with approximately 1,000 licenses.  The settlement required Straight Path to sell those licenses and remit 20 percent of the overall proceeds. Verizon said on Wednesday it had completed its $3.1 billion acquisition of the company it announced in May 2017. The settlement represents the largest civil penalty paid to resolve an FCC investigation.  A Verizon spokesman declined to comment. The settlement resolved conduct from before Verizon\u2019s announced acquisition.  The sales proceeds does not include a separate $15 million penalty that Straight Path paid to the FCC in January 2017.  The licenses are important to emerging 5G technology that will allow for much faster wireless networks and could usher in advances like remote surgical procedures and self-driving vehicles.  The FCC said in January 2017 that Straight Path was \u201csquatting on spectrum licenses\u201d and that was \u201cfundamentally inconsistent with the public good.\u201d The FCC probe was prompted by allegations of fraud in November 2015 by an anonymous short seller of the company\u2019s stock, Reuters reported earlier.

Yahoo has emerged as the centerpiece of Verizon Media\u2019s plans to rescue the once-dominant collection of internet assets which has been in decline since the late 2000s.  \u201cWe do not comment on rumors and speculation,\u201d Verizon Media said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cYahoo Finance is integral to Verizon Media\u2019s growth strategy.

Despite the epic erosion of usage and value of Verizon Media\u2019s businesses, Yahoo Finance has remained a bright spot. It was the most visited site in the business and finance news category in May, beating out Forbes and CNBC, and it has attracted over 100 million global monthly visitors on average this year, according to data from media analytics company comScore.  A separate source with direct knowledge of Verizon\u2019s plans said the company is seeking to acquire more media assets to bolster its portfolio and Yahoo Finance\u2019s business.  The source said Verizon had received unsolicited interest in Yahoo Finance but did not entertain the conversations.  Verizon Media has struggled with declining usage and revenue growth. Last year, Verizon wrote down the value of its media assets by $4.6 billion.  Verizon spent a combined $9.2 billion to buy AOL and Yahoo in 2015 and 2017, respectively. Former Verizon Media Chief Executive Tim Armstrong had explored options for the media group, including buying it out from Verizon, news website The Information reported last year.  Yahoo was a pioneer of the internet era in the 1990s. At its peak, the company\u2019s market value in the late 1990s was more than $125 billion. AOL\u2019s combined market value the day after it announced a $165 billion offer to buy Time Warner in 2000 was over $340 billion.

It is unclear how much Verizon was hoping to reap from a sale of Yahoo Finance. Other news-publication deals could provide a benchmark for valuation. German digital publisher Axel Springer bought the 88% it did not already own of New York-based news publication Business Insider in 2015, in a deal that valued Business Insider at $442 million.

Vestberg, 52, joined Verizon a year ago after being fired as chief executive at communications equipment maker Ericsson ERICb.STERIC.O in 2016, following years of dismal growth and weak earnings.  At Verizon he headed a team building out Verizon's fiber network infrastructure, and he will lead Verizon in a strategy that differs markedly from wireless rival AT&T Inc T.N which is battling with the U.S. Justice Department to acquire media company Time Warner Inc TWX.N in an $85 billion deal.  Current Verizon CEO, Lowell McAdam, said in an interview it was the perfect time to hand the reins to Vestberg, with Verizon at an \u201cinflection point\u201d holding all the pieces it needs for 5G, such as fiber and spectrum.  Some analysts had expected John Stratton, Verizon\u2019s president of global operations, to succeed McAdam. Instead Stratton will retire.  Vestberg said in an interview Verizon would keep pursuing its current 5G strategy but he did not \u201csee anything new on the horizon\u201d to pursue media content.  Under McAdam, Verizon expanded into content when it bought media sites AOL and Yahoo, creating a media division called Oath last year, which also owns sites like Tumblr and HuffPost.  Vestberg was CEO of Sweden\u2019s Ericsson for six years, focusing on growth over profit. He spent some 28 billion crowns buying companies to boost Ericsson\u2019s position in other fields than its mainstay mobile network gear equipment, such as media assets.  That left Ericsson with costs that were too high and put it into a slump as rising competition hit the network gear market.  Lars Soderfjell, a portfolio manager at Finnish bank Alandsbanken, which owns Ericsson shares, said Vestberg pushed to expand the company\u2019s services unit, which included managing networks for mobile operators. He said that could make Vestberg a good fit for Verizon as it focuses on building its 5G network.  Nomura analysts described the common understanding of Vestberg\u2019s Ericsson tenure as \u201cstock flat, fired\u201d but wrote in an note that he had served during a period of intense competition in an industry that then consolidated. Nomura expected other executives to leave Verizon after the appointment.  Until he retires at year end, McAdam will serve as executive chairman, then become non-executive chairman, the company said in a statement.  Verizon has gained about 40 percent of its $202.5 billion market value since McAdam took charge of the company on Aug. 1, 2011.  By early afternoon, Verizon shares rose 0.3 percent to $49.18 each, on a day that other tech shares fell on reports Apple AAPL.O expects to cut iPhone production this year.","38":"Jan 8 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc said on Tuesday it added 650,000 net new phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill in the fourth quarter.

The company has demanded that Verizon pay licensing fees for more than 230 of the telecoms equipment maker\u2019s patents and is seeking over $1 billion, a person has told Reuters, against a background of mounting U.S.-China trade tensions.  Republican Senator Marco Rubio has described Huawei\u2019s demand as \u201cbaseless\u201d and filed the legislation as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, which places a broad ban on the use of U.S. federal money to buy Huawei products citing national security concerns.  \u201cWe simply don\u2019t believe Marco Rubio\u2019s amendment could be passed as law,\u201d Huawei\u2019s chief legal officer, Song Liuping, said at the company\u2019s Shenzhen headquarters on Thursday.  Intellectual property (IP) rights \u201cshould not be politicized\u201d, Song said. \u201cIP is a private property issue and should be free from the competition, trade talks and any other allegations that countries have between them.\u201d  Song added that Huawei has been discussing patent licensing with companies in the United States, Europe and other parts of the world on a regular basis.  While the measure proposed by Rubio is several steps from becoming law, lawmakers have successfully used the NDAA in the past to crack down on the Chinese firm.  Huawei, the world\u2019s biggest telecommunications equipment maker and No.2 smartphone maker, denies its products pose a security threat and has sought to fight back in U.S. courts since Washington put it on an export blacklist last month.  FILE PHOTO: A Huawei company logo is seen at CES (Consumer Electronics Show) Asia 2019 in Shanghai, China June 11, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  ROYALTIES  It recently sued the U.S. government over the NDAA.  The Chinese firm also sued CNEX Labs Inc, alleging misappropriation of trade secrets involving a memory control technology by the California semiconductor designer and poaching of employees.  A U.S. jury on Wednesday cleared CNEX, while awarding the U.S. firm no damages on its own trade theft claims.  Analysts have said Huawei may be more inclined to monetize its U.S. patents now that the market ban and supplier ban imposed by Washington is expected to cost the firm $30 billion in revenue.  However, Song said Huawei has no intention of weaponizing the company\u2019s IP rights, echoing founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei from earlier this month.  Huawei, which has received over $1.4 billion in licensing revenue since 2015, is against charging exorbitant royalties, Song said, adding the firm had never been asked by a court to pay damages for malicious IP theft.  In 2017, a jury found Huawei misappropriated trade secrets from T-Mobile TMUS.O and ordered it to pay $4.8 million to the U.S. telco for breaching a handset supply contract between the two companies. The jury, however, did not find Huawei's misappropriation \"wilful and malicious\".  \u201cWe are not going to be a company with a major source of revenue from royalties,\u201d Song said, adding that Huawei will remain focused on its core business for its top line.  Huawei paid more than $6 billion in royalties to legally implement IP of other companies and has been granted 87,805 patents, of which 11,152 are U.S. patents, Song said.  Huawei has the most 5G standard essential patents in the world, according to consultancy IPlytics.","46":"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc on Tuesday said it does not expect profit growth in 2019 due to a higher tax rate and interest expense, and missed Wall Street estimates for fourth quarter revenue.  FILE PHOTO - The Verizon logo is seen on the side of a truck in New York City, U.S., October 13, 2016. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  The largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers said 5G, the next-generation wireless network that is expected to bring much faster data speeds, will not have a large impact on Verizon\u2019s financials until 2020, foreshadowing a year of flat growth for the major U.S. carriers.  Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson, said in a note on Tuesday that investors have been focused on what the build-out of 5G will cost Verizon rather than how much it will earn from the technology.  Moffett also said the company\u2019s profit guidance this year was \u201cnot very inspiring,\u201d given the strong U.S. economy.  Verizon Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said during the earnings call with analysts that the company expects earnings per share growth to be reduced by between 24 cents and 28 cents, due to the higher effective tax rate and increased interest expense.  Ellis said Verizon\u2019s business was still strong enough to offset the \u201cnon-operational items\u201d and balance out to the same earnings per share level from 2018.  Shares of Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers, were down 2.4 percent to $53.75 in afternoon trading.  Total operating revenue rose 1 percent to $34.28 billion in the fourth quarter, missing the average analyst estimate of $34.44 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  The company forecast an increase in 2019 capital spending to a range of $17 billion to $18 billion, including expansion of the commercial launch of its 5G wireless technology, up from $16.7 billion last year.  Verizon, which has 118 million wireless customers, said it added a net 653,000 postpaid phone subscribers during the fourth quarter, beating the average estimate of 355,600, according to research firm FactSet.  Analysts pay attention to postpaid customers, or those with a recurring bill, because they are more valuable to carriers and remain with the company longer than prepaid customers.  The company lost 46,000 Fios video subscribers during the quarter, more than the 29,000 it lost last year, as viewers leave for cheaper internet TV services rather than pay for pricier cable packages. Analysts looked for 51,000 losses.  Net income attributable to the company fell to $1.94 billion, or 47 cents per share, in the quarter, from $18.78 billion, or $4.56 per share, a year earlier, when it recorded a $16.8 billion one-time benefit from the U.S. tax overhaul.  Revenue for the Verizon Media Group, formerly called Oath and which includes Yahoo and AOL, was $2.1 billion during the quarter, down 5.8 percent from the prior year.  Excluding items, Verizon earned $1.12 per share, above the average estimate of $1.09 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.","47":"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N beat estimates for third-quarter profit on Wednesday, helped by strong demand for its phone and internet services as offices and schools continued to operate virtually amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  The health crisis has brought global economies to a halt, but the telecom sector has been relatively less affected. With lockdowns easing, Verizon gradually reopened all of its company-operated retail stores in the quarter, implementing touch-less retail, appointments and curbside pickups.  Verizon added 283,000 postpaid phone subscribers in the third quarter, above the average estimate of 268,000, according to research firm FactSet.  Total operating revenue fell 4.1% to $31.54 billion, which the company attributed to lower customer activity and the timing of certain device launches.  Apple Inc AAPL.O, one of Verizon's key partners, has delayed the launch of its new iPhones by about a month this year.  Revenue in Verizon\u2019s media unit, which includes Yahoo, HuffPost and TechCrunch, declined 7.4% in the quarter to $1.7 billion from a year earlier as companies cut down on advertising to rein in expenses.  Net income fell to $4.50 billion, or $1.05 per share in the quarter, from $5.34 billion, or $1.25 per share a year earlier, with about 5 cents of COVID-19-related net impact, Verizon said.  Excluding items, Verizon earned $1.25 per share, above analysts\u2019 average estimate of $1.22.  The company also said it now expects full-year 2020 adjusted EPS growth of 0% to 2%.

Qualcomm said 5G adoption will be faster than 4G due to the timing of commercialization of the technology in China and availability of chipsets across different price tiers.  Going by Qualcomm\u2019s previous forecast of a range between 175 million and 225 million 5G devices for next year, the 2021 forecast suggests 125% growth from the midpoint of the 2020 outlook.  Analysts attach importance to occasional smartphone estimate figures from Qualcomm, given its close relationship with phone makers.  Verizon Communications Inc , in a presentation to analysts after markets close, said it expects revenue from 5G growth opportunities to increase next year and anticipates launching 5G in more than 30 cities by the end of this year.  Next-generation 5G smartphones are expected to make tasks like watching videos or playing games on mobile networks as good as or better than on a Wi-Fi connection.  Qualcomm and its rivals stand to benefit from faster 5G adoption because the phones will require more chips to gain the speed boost.","49":"Feb 14 (Reuters) - Adage Capital Partners GP LLC:  * ADAGE CAPITAL PARTNERS GP LLC DISSOLVES SHARE STAKE IN ABBVIE INC - SEC FILING  * ADAGE CAPITAL PARTNERS GP LLC CUTS SHARE STAKE IN VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC BY 17.5% TO 4.1 MILLION SHARES - SEC FILING  * ADAGE CAPITAL PARTNERS GP LLC CUTS SHARE STAKE IN WELLS FARGO & CO BY 16.1% TO 3.9 MILLION SHARES - SEC FILING  * ADAGE CAPITAL PARTNERS GP LLC CUTS SHARE STAKE IN TWITTER INC BY 92.1% TO 74,600 SHARES - SEC FILING  * ADAGE CAPITAL PARTNERS GP LLC UPS SHARE STAKE IN SNAP INC BY 22.9 PERCENT TO 2.2 MILLION CLASS A SHARES - SEC FILING  * ADAGE CAPITAL PARTNERS GP LLC CUTS SHARE STAKE IN NOBLE ENERGY INC BY 28.5 PERCENT TO 6.3 MILLION SHARES - SEC FILING  * ADAGE CAPITAL PARTNERS GP LLC - CHANGE IN HOLDINGS ARE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND COMPARED WITH THE PREVIOUS QUARTER ENDED AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 Source for the quarter ended December 31, 2019: bit.ly\/2UTbN7w  Source for the quarter ended September 30, 2019: bit.ly\/2KgPJxt","50":"Feb 28 (Reuters) - Straight Path Communications Inc :  * STRAIGHT PATH COMMUNICATIONS ANNOUNCES COMPLETION OF MERGER WITH VERIZON Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","51":"FILE PHOTO: A contract crew from Verizon installs 5G telecommunications equipment on a tower in Orem, Utah, U.S. December 3, 2019.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless carrier, said in a statement its network was operational in the area and efforts are underway to \u201cfurther stabilize and strengthen our wireless network.\u201d  The company said it would commit the funds \u201cto build the most technologically advanced wireless network in the area\u201d and plans to add next-generation wireless 5G technology in Panama City, Florida, joining the much larger cities of Los Angeles, Houston, Indianapolis and Sacramento, California.  The move follows criticism of the company\u2019s performance by elected officials in Florida after the storm damage.  Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai last week called for wireless carriers to waive October bills for people most severely affected by Hurricane Michael. Later that day, Verizon said it would waive bills for consumer and business customers in two Florida counties for three months. Verizon last week extended the three-month bill waiver to another seven Florida counties.  Michael crashed into the Florida Panhandle on Oct. 10 as one of the most powerful storms on record to hit the continental United States. The storm damaged fiber networks and electrical wires necessary for broadband and mobile phone service.  Pai said last week that progress in restoring service was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d and that the FCC will investigate the outages. He said Tuesday he had met with all four major U.S. wireless carriers last week to understand the \u201curgency\u201d of the situation.  The FCC said nearly all wireless cell sites are back in service in Florida, but 14 percent remain out in Gulf County and 17 percent in Bay County.  Verizon attributed the delays in restoring coverage in part to significant damage to fiber connections in Florida\u2019s Panhandle, the strength of the storm and repeated new cuts to its fiber network by repair crews.  U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, said last week in a letter to Verizon that its competitors had been restoring service much faster.  Verizon said the $25 million network technology upgrade would be largely spent in 2019.","53":"FILE PHOTO: TomTom navigation are seen in front of TomTom displayed logo in this illustration taken July 28, 2017.

The Amsterdam-based company, which withdrew its original outlook in late March, had initially said it expected its 2020 free cash flow to be a mid to high single digit percentage of the group\u2019s revenue. The group said the outbreak made it impossible to provide specific forecasts for the year.  Its first-quarter revenue from its core location technology business fell 11%, due to a downturn in its automotive segment, but was partly offset by an uptake in its enterprise business, which supplies government bodies, traffic management and tech companies.  \u201cOur Automotive revenue arises principally from customer vehicle sales, which are sharply impacted by factory closures,\u201d said the company\u2019s chief executive officer, Harold Goddijn.  He added that consumer revenue, which slumped 40% in the first quarter, would be hit by a steep decline in demand arising from retail store closures, retailers reducing inventories, and people not driving, but said strong debt-free balance sheet made the group resilient.  TomTom reported a first-quarter group revenue down 23% at 131 million euros ($143.7 million).  The company had said in its initial outlook it expected its full-year revenue to decline around 5% year-on year, coming in at between 650 and 675 million euros.  TomTom, which is moving away from selling devices to offering software services, also announced it would expand its current agreement with Verizon VZ.N, which would now begin to integrate TomTom\u2019s Maps APIs and software development kits in its location services products.","54":"Oct 25 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc on Friday beat analysts\u2019 quarterly estimates for new subscribers who pay a monthly bill, at a time when it prepares to roll out the much-faster 5G mobile technology in more than 17 cities.

As technology has advanced, it has become harder to avoid violating \u2014 or \u201cinfringing\u201d \u2014 patent rights. There are millions of U.S. patents in force, and a typical smartphone implicates hundreds of thousands of them.  Companies like Apple Inc, Nokia Inc and Qualcomm Inc own many thousands of patents issued by governments around the world.  It is not unusual for these firms to try to make money from their massive patent portfolios. Nokia, for example, routinely brings in more than $1 billion a year from licensing its patents to others.  Large companies like Verizon will try to identify patents they might be violating, said Gaston Kroub, a patent lawyer in New York. But that can be a challenge because so many patents are granted every year, Kroub said.  \u201cSophisticated companies like Verizon understand that they could be approached by licensors of any stripe at any time,\u201d Kroub said. The philosophy of wireless carriers and smartphone companies, Kroub said, can be \u201clet\u2019s deal with these claims as they arrive, because we don\u2019t know who will knock on our door next.\u201d  Tom Cotter, a professor of patent law at the University of Minnesota, said it was possible Huawei executives believe Verizon has been infringing their U.S. patents for some time but for business reasons waited until now to seek compensation.  Patent owners \u201cmay not enforce their patents for a period of time, but they can choose do to so whenever they want to,\u201d Cotter said. \u201cIt happens all the time.\u201d  What happens if Verizon does not pay?  Huawei may end up going to a U.S. court and suing Verizon for alleged patent infringement.  While some licensing disputes are resolved without lawsuits, litigation is fairly common. Huawei and Samsung Electronics Co recently settled a global legal battle on confidential terms.  A defendant in a patent case typically argues that it does not actually infringe the asserted patents, or that they were mistakenly issued and should be revoked.  In a lawsuit, a patent owner can ask a judge to block sales of infringing products. While such injunctions are rarely granted in the United States, the threat of one can motivate a defendant to settle with the patent owner.  Legal experts said Huawei is likely prepared to go to court.  \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can make a demand of $1 billion and not be prepared for the answer to be no, at least at first, and for the need to litigate,\u201d Kroub said.  Has Huawei been an aggressive enforcer of its patents?  Huawei has long been known for defending itself against U.S. patent infringement claims, rather than bringing them. But that could be changing.  George Koomullil, a patent analyst at Pleasanton, California-based technology company Relecura, said that 10 or 15 years ago Huawei applied for a relatively modest number of patents. But the company has been more aggressive about applying for patents since around 2007, and particularly in recent years, Koomullil said.  Huawei may be more inclined to monetize its U.S. patents now that the U.S. government has limited its ability to sell products in the country, Kroub said.  The National Defense Authorization Act last year placed a broad ban on the use of federal money to purchase products from Huawei, citing national security concerns.  Last month, the Trump administration banned Huawei from buying vital U.S. technology without special approval and effectively barring its equipment from U.S. telecom networks.  Kroub said Huawei\u2019s licensing demand could reflect a \u201cdesperation to come up with ways of generating revenue in the U.S. market, especially considering the traditional ways of offering products and selling things to business is closed to them.\u201d  Franklin Turner, a government contracts lawyer at McCarter & English in Washington, said the patent licensing demand may also be a way for Huawei to \u201cretaliate\u201d against the United States.  Republican Senator Marco Rubio said on Twitter on Thursday that the demand against Verizon was an \u201cattempt by (Huawei) to retaliate against the U.S. by setting the stage for baseless, but costly, patent claims.\u201d","64":"May 8 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc:  * VERIZON FILES PRICING TERM SHEET WITH U.S. SEC RELATED TO $1.788 BILLION FLOATING RATE NOTES DUE 2025 - SEC FILING Source text: (bit.ly\/2I05TfD) Further company coverage:","65":"July 24 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc reported a 5.4 percent rise in quarterly revenue on Tuesday, as it attracted more postpaid subscribers with unlimited data plans.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers has cut prices and made its offerings more attractive by bundling services such as Apple Music to battle intense competition in the industry.  The company said that in the fourth quarter, it added 790,000 phone customers who pay a monthly bill, well above the average analysts\u2019 estimate of 525,000 subscribers, according to research firm FactSet.  Verizon\u2019s reported post-paid phone churn of 1.13% for the fourth quarter, the seventh consecutive quarterly increase. Analysts at New Street Research said lowering churn would be more difficult with shift in the wireless market.  Total operating revenue rose to $34.78 billion from $34.28 billion, beating the estimate of $34.60 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  In October, Verizon said it would offer a year-long subscription to Walt Disney Co's DIS.N Disney+ with its unlimited plans, a move aimed at rival AT&T Inc T.N, which is expected to launch its own streaming platform HBO Max in May.  Revenue in Verizon's media unit, which includes Yahoo, HuffPost and TechCrunch, was nearly flat at $2.1 billion from a year earlier. The company said it wrote down $236 million during the fourth quarter for the media business, which has struggled to grow as ad revenue moved to larger digital players like Alphabet's Google GOOGL.O.  Net income rose to $5.22 billion, or $1.23 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 from $2.07 billion, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier. The company also recorded a $2.2 billion tax benefit related to the sale of preferred shares in a foreign affiliate.  The company built out its network of 5G in Kansas City, Little Rock and Cincinnati, rolling out the next generation of wireless in 34 cities in 2019.

Shares of the company rose 2.28 percent to $49.77 in morning trading.  Verizon lost 24,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill, while analysts expected it to lose 69,000 subscribers, according to financial and data analytics firm FactSet.  Speaking on the post-earnings conference call, Verizon Chief Financial Officer Matthew Ellis said the company was not interested at this time in acquiring broadcast or cable networks, but continued to look at \u201cover-the-top\u201d options, or cheaper streaming video packages with fewer channels.  Verizon was a bidder for Twenty-First Century Fox Inc assets, which Walt Disney Co is trying to buy for $52.4 billion.  The company expects to have an overall product offering for consumers in the three to five markets where it plans to launch home 5G broadband later this year, and will add more content to Oath, its subsidiary that owns Yahoo! and AOL, Ellis said.  That could include news, sports, finance or entertainment content, Ellis said in an interview.  Analysts questioned whether Verizon had its sights on traditional media similar to AT&T Inc, which is fighting in court against the U.S. Department of Justice to close its acquisition of Time Warner Inc, and while Ellis said the company would look at potential deals, it is not the main focus.  Verizon instead expects to add to its distribution rights for digital content, Ellis said.  Net income attributable to Verizon rose to $4.55 billion, or $1.11 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31 from $3.45 billion, or 85 cents per share, a year earlier.  On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.17 per share. Total operating revenue rose to $31.77 billion from $29.81 billion a year earlier.  Analysts had expected adjusted earnings of $1.10 per share and revenue of $31.26 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Verizon added 66,000 Fios internet customers during the quarter and lost 22,000 Fios video subscribers.  Verizon\u2019s first-quarter 2018 earnings per share included approximately 21 cents due to tax reform and accounting changes for revenue recognition.  The company expects savings from tax reform will generate a net $3.5 billion to $4 billion benefit to cash flow from operations in 2018, resulting in a 55 to 65 cent increase in 2018 earnings per share.

Verizon said its customers will need a Motorola Z3 mobile and a device called 5G moto mod to connect to the 5G network.  The largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers will offer the device for $50 initially and its customers would not have to pay for 5G use for the first three months.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers has been focusing on upgrading its network and winning over more customers in a saturated market as rivals AT&T Inc T.N, Sprint Corp S.N and T-Mobile have been focusing on merger deals and paying down debt.  Verizon shares rose 3.4 percent to $56.87, their highest in more than 18 years.  The company said it added a net 295,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill during the third quarter, easily beating the estimate of 161,000 provided by research firm FactSet.  Wall Street analysts pay attention to customers with a recurring bill, or so-called \u201cpostpaid\u201d customers, as they are more valuable to carriers.  Verizon has been investing heavily this year in its next generation 5G network, which will become the backbone of its largest business.  Meanwhile, its next-largest rival AT&T Inc T.N bought Time Warner for $85 billion, in a bet that it can use media content on its services to lure more customers. T-Mobile and Sprint Corp S.N, the third and fourth-placed U.S. carriers, have agreed to merge in the hope of cutting costs and becoming more competitive.  AT&T and Sprint have been focusing on paying down debt rather than winning customers by lowering prices, which meant Verizon did not face cut-throat competition in the quarter, said Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson.  \u201cCompetitive intensity is now more moderate than at any time since 2014,\u201d said Moffett in a research note. \u201cWith two of the Big Four all but taking a knee, Verizon - and T-Mobile - now has the freedom to grow without discounting.\u201d  OATH INTEGRATION  Verizon\u2019s media and traditional phone businesses did not fare as well.  Revenue from Oath, its digital media subsidiary that owns dozens of websites including AOL and Yahoo, fell 7 percent to $1.8 billion for the third quarter. Verizon said it does not expect Oath to reach its previous goal of $10 billion in revenue by 2020, as it struggles to generate as much revenue as it hoped from mobile advertising, to make up for shrinking desktop usage of its websites. Last month, Verizon said Oath CEO Tim Armstrong would leave the company at the end of the year.  \u201cI would expect the next move will be that the business is jettisoned entirely,\u201d said Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with New Street Research.  Verizon declined comment on any planned deals. Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said in an interview with Reuters that Oath\u2019s revenue trend had not met expectations, but the company is working to integrate its advertising sales platform this quarter.  \u201cThat will make it easier for publishers to do business with us,\u201d Ellis said.  Net income attributable to the company rose to $4.92 billion, or $1.19 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $3.62 billion, or 89 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding some items, Verizon earned $1.22 per share, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $1.19 per share, according to Refinitiv data.  Verizon said it is on track to reach $10 billion in cumulative cash savings by 2021.  5G ROLLOUT  Verizon launched home 5G internet service on Oct. 1 in parts of Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles and Sacramento. The next-generation wireless network is expected to bring faster data speeds, which Verizon hopes will help it compete with competitors like cable company Comcast Corp CMCSA.O.  It has, so far, concentrated on investing in its wireless network rather than deal-making. Its next-largest competitor AT&T Inc T.N bought Time Warner in an $85 billion deal that closed in June, betting it could attract more customers with media content.  Verizon\u2019s wireline business, which sells traditional phone service and its Fios video and internet products, saw revenue decline 3.7 percent from last year to $7.4 billion.  It lost 63,000 Fios video subscribers during the quarter, more than the 18,000 it lost last year, as viewers continue to favor cheaper TV services delivered over the internet, over paying for pricier cable packages.  It added 54,000 Fios internet customers, fewer than the 66,000 Verizon added a year earlier.

REUTERS\/Scott Morgan  The investments were disclosed in a regulatory filing detailing Berkshire\u2019s U.S.-listed stock holdings as of Dec. 31.  Berkshire also disclosed a new $499 million stake in the professional services company Marsh & McLennan Cos.  To make room, Berkshire reduced its investments in several companies including Apple Inc, though at approximately $121 billion the iPhone maker remains by far its largest common stock holding.  Verizon shares rose 3.0%, Chevron rose 2.2% and Marsh was unchanged in after-hours trading following Berkshire\u2019s filing.  Tuesday\u2019s filing signals where Buffett and his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler see value, without saying who bought what. Buffett normally handles larger investments such as Verizon and Chevron.  \u201cThey are Buffett-esque investments,\u201d said Steven Check, who invests $1.3 billion at Check Capital Management Inc in Costa Mesa, California, including $300 million in Berkshire. \u201cVerizon has a low price-earnings ratio, and while oil prices are recovering the stocks still have a long way to go.\u201d  The filing also shows Berkshire deploying some of its cash hoard, which totaled $145.7 billion as of Sept. 30.  Berkshire owns more than 90 businesses including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad and Dairy Queen ice cream, but has gone five years since its last big acquisition.  The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate had begun investing in Verizon, Chevron and Marsh by last year\u2019s third quarter.  As it had several times before, Berkshire won permission from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to delay revealing the stakes, to avoid having investors piggyback on its wagers before it was done buying.  Tuesday\u2019s filing showed Berkshire, a major investor in Bank of America Corp, cutting back on other banks, reducing its stake in Wells Fargo & Co and shedding JPMorgan Chase & Co, M&T Bank Corp and PNC Financial Services Group Inc.  Berkshire also invested more in drugmakers Abbvie Inc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Merck & Co while selling a small stake in COVID-19 vaccine maker Pfizer Inc. It also shed mining company Barrick Gold Corp.  Doug Kass, managing partner of Seabreeze Capital Investment Inc in Palm Beach, Florida, said the Verizon investment \u201cmakes sense\u201d reflecting the company\u2019s dividend payout and wireless revenue growth prospects.  He said the lowered bank stakes may reflect Buffett\u2019s concern about persistent low interest rates, and loan losses related to the coronavirus.  Berkshire is expected to release year-end results and Buffett\u2019s annual shareholder letter on Feb. 27.","91":"WASHINGTON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc and its Straight Path Communications unit paid a $614 million civil penalty as part of a January 2017 settlement with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, the agency said on Wednesday.  The telecommunications regulator said the settlement resolved an investigation into allegations that Straight Path failed to use the spectrum it was awarded, and in doing so violated the FCC\u2019s rules in connection with approximately 1,000 licenses.  The settlement required Straight Path to sell its licenses and remit 20 percent of the overall proceeds. Verizon said on Wednesday it had completed its $3.1 billion acquisition of the company it announced in May 2017. The settlement represents the largest ever civil penalty paid to resolve an FCC investigation.

Lee readies for a new trial next month, the tech giant has quietly ramped up a public relations campaign touting Lee's deal-making expertise including in winning a $6.6 billion contract from Verizon VZ.N.  FILE PHOTO: Samsung Group heir Jay Y. Lee arrives for a court hearing to review a detention warrant request against him at the Seoul Central District Court in Seoul, South Korea, June 8, 2020. REUTERS\/Kim Hong-Ji  Lauding the Samsung heir as \u2018the best salesman\u2019, the firm has over the past year released a flurry of statements and photos of his visits to its many business sites, showcasing a side of the normally-reserved Lee whose public image has taken a battering over a lengthy bribery scandal.  The mounting legal travails for Lee, which have cast a cloud over the leadership of one of the world\u2019s biggest tech companies, coincide with the reformist drive of President Moon Jae-in, elected three years ago after the impeachment and jailing of his predecessor Park Geun-hye.  Lee was indicted last week on suspicions of accounting fraud and stock price manipulation. A trial is scheduled to start on Oct. 22.  The stakes are high, and Samsung\u2019s public relations machine has stepped up a charm offensive, telling local media in a message this week that it expected cutting-edge network equipment business to grow into \u201cthe first flagship business of the Lee Jae-yong era,\u201d using the Vice Chairman of Samsung Electronics\u2019 Korean name.  According to the message seen by Reuters, Samsung said Lee actively engaged Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg on his visit to South Korea last year, and made several video calls with him ahead of clinching a $6.64 billion contract.  Samsung on Monday announced the contract to provide network equipment to Verizon in the United States, considered a major win as the firm seeks to narrow the gap in the 5G network market with frontrunner Huawei [HWT.UL], which is grappling with U.S. restrictions.  In a statement to Reuters, Samsung said: \u201cVice Chairman Jay Y. Lee has played a key role in developing new growth businesses and relationship with global clients and partners.\u201d  \u201cThe company responded to media requests and inquiries about his role and client relations,\u201d it added, saying that this \u201cwas part of normal communications with journalists.\u201d  In the message, Samsung also highlighted Lee's role in its 5G deal with Japan's KDDI 9433.T last year despite the worsening bilateral relations.  \u201cSamsung keeps exposing Lee to the media, to give the message that Lee plays a big role, so if he goes to jail or faces lengthy trials, this would disrupt management, put Samsung in difficulty, and Korean economy in difficulty,\u201d said Professor Park Sang-in of Seoul National University, a governance expert.  REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE  The fresh charges against Lee has further scarred the 52-year old Samsung scion\u2019s reputation and come at a time the world\u2019s biggest memory chip maker and No.2 smartphone manufacturer navigates intensifying competition and the coronavirus pandemic.  Lee is also facing a separate trial on charges of bribing former president Park in an influence-peddling scandal to take control of the business empire from his father, group patriarch Lee Kun-hee, who has been incapacitated since suffering a heart attack in 2014.  President Moon has pledged to curb the power of South Korea\u2019s chaebol, or family-owned conglomerates.  In the past, convicted business tycoons were shown leniency by courts for their economic contributions, but in a departure, Lee was jailed for nearly a year over the scandal involving Park.  Lee\u2019s father was convicted previously of breach of trust and tax evasion charges, but later received a presidential pardon.  In June, while refuting media reports on Lee\u2019s alleged wrongdoings, Samsung said such reports are \u201cnever desirable not only for Samsung\u2019s future but the future of the Korean economy.\u201d  Samsung Electronics, the crown jewel in the Samsung group, reported annual revenue in 2019 equivalent to 12% of South Korea\u2019s economic output. A jump in chip exports helped slow the pace of decline in South Korean exports in the first 10 days of September, trade data showed on Friday.  \u201cSamsung\u2019s PR efforts seem to be to build Lee\u2019s good image,\u201d said Park Ju-gun, head of research firm CEO Score.  \u201cIf Lee cannot serve his role then it could adversely affect the economy, seems to be the nuance.\u201d","94":"FILE PHOTO: The Verizon logo is seen on the side of a truck in New York City, U.S., October 13, 2016.

Verizon lost 24,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill, while analysts expected it to lose 69,000 subscribers, according to financial and data analytics firm FactSet.  Speaking on the post-earnings conference call, Verizon Chief Financial Officer Matthew Ellis said the company was not interested at this time in acquiring broadcast or cable networks, but continued to look at \u201cover-the-top\u201d options, or cheaper streaming video packages with fewer channels.  Verizon was a bidder for Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOXA.O assets, which Walt Disney Co DIS.N is trying to buy for $52.4 billion.  The company expects to have an overall product offering for consumers in the three to five markets where it plans to launch home 5G broadband later this year, and will add more content to Oath, its subsidiary that owns Yahoo! and AOL, Ellis said.  That could include news, sports, finance or entertainment content, Ellis said in an interview.  Analysts questioned whether Verizon had its sights on traditional media similar to AT&T Inc T.N, which is fighting in court against the U.S. Department of Justice to close its acquisition of Time Warner Inc TWX.N, and while Ellis said the company would look at potential deals, it is not the main focus.  Verizon instead expects to add to its distribution rights for digital content, Ellis said.  Net income attributable to Verizon rose to $4.55 billion, or $1.11 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31 from $3.45 billion, or 85 cents per share, a year earlier.  On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.17 per share. Total operating revenue rose to $31.77 billion from $29.81 billion a year earlier.  Analysts had expected adjusted earnings of $1.10 per share and revenue of $31.26 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Verizon added 66,000 Fios internet customers during the quarter and lost 22,000 Fios video subscribers.  Verizon\u2019s first-quarter 2018 earnings per share included about 21 cents due to tax reform and accounting changes for revenue recognition.  The company said it expected savings from tax reform to generate a net $3.5 billion to $4 billion benefit to cash flow from operations in 2018, resulting in a 55 to 65 cent increase in 2018 earnings per share.","97":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. has opened a probe into alleged coordination by AT&T Inc, Verizon Communications and a telecommunications standards organization to hinder consumers from easily switching wireless carriers, a person briefed on the matter said on Friday.  FILE PHOTO: An AT&T logo is pictured in Pasadena, California, U.S., January 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni\/File Photo  Verizon and AT&T acknowledged the government probe and said they were working with regulators.  At issue is a technology that could make carriers\u2019 business more volatile. Called eSIM, it allows consumers to switch wireless providers without having to insert a new physical SIM card, an identifying microchip. That makes it easier to compare wireless networks and easily select a new service when desired.  Verizon called the probe \u201cmuch ado about nothing,\u201d adding that it has been working with the Justice Department for several months \u201cregarding the inquiry,\u201d according to spokesman Rich Young.  The New York Times reported on Friday that the Justice Department had opened an investigation about five months ago after at least one device maker and one wireless carrier filed formal complaints with the Justice Department.  The Justice Department sent demands to AT&T, Verizon and the GSMA, an industry standards-setting group, on efforts to thwart eSIM.  Apple Inc and other equipment makers have complained to the Justice Department about wireless carrier practices related to eSIM technology, two sources familiar with the matter said. Apple declined to comment.  \u201cThe reality is that we have a difference of opinion with a couple of phone equipment manufacturers regarding the development of e-SIM standards. Nothing more,\u201d Verizon\u2019s Young said.  An AT&T spokesman said in an email: \u201cAlong with other GSMA members, we have provided information to the government in response to their requests and will continue to work proactively within GSMA, including with those who might disagree with the proposed standards.\u201d  News of the probe comes at a critical time for AT&T which is being sued by the Justice Department to stop its deal to buy media company Time Warner Inc.  The U.S. government has argued in a trial that is nearing completion that the proposed deal would spur AT&T to charge its pay TV rivals more for Time Warner content.  However, Judge Richard Leon, who will decide if AT&T will be allowed to buy Time Warner, is unlikely to consider a report of potential wrongdoing by the wireless giant because it is irrelevant to the merger trial under way in Washington, said Seth Bloom, a veteran of the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division.  The Department of Justice and the GSMA, the telecommunications standard setting group, declined to comment on news of the investigation.  Shares of AT&T and Verizon dipped after the initial Times report, with AT&T closing down 0.4 percent at $34.67, and Verizon ending off 1.1 percent, at $47.90.  The person briefed on the matter told Reuters that other wireless operators potentially received inquiries from the government.  It is common practice for the Justice Department to send CIDs, the civil equivalent of a subpoena, to all major players in the industry because the agency wants evidence from companies that allegedly participate in any conspiracy as well as those outside of it, according to Ethan Glass, a former trial attorney with the Justice Department now at the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP.  The source said the Obama administration had investigated similar claims in 2016 but did not take any action.  Consumer advocates learned in February that Verizon was apparently planning to lock phones as an anti-theft measure, and later were told by industry participants that Verizon was working with AT&T in hopes of convincing the GSMA to create a standard for locking the phones, according to Harold Feld, a senior vice president at Public Knowledge.  Consumer advocates support the idea of an electronic SIM card, which is in the process of being rolled out, since it allows phone owners to bargain hunt and contract with any network or to shift networks easily while traveling, said Feld.  \u201cI am very happy that the DOJ is taking its job as a cop on the beat very seriously,\u201d said Feld.","98":"Sept 7 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc\u2019s head of media and advertising business Tim Armstrong is in talks to leave the U.S. wireless carrier, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Verizon Communications Inc, which has been criticized for the pace of its restoration efforts, said late on Tuesday that all consumer and business customers in hard hit Bay County and Gulf County, Florida, would be automatically credited for three months of mobile service for each line they have.  At least 18 deaths in four states have been blamed on Michael, which crashed into the Florida Panhandle on Oct. 10 as one of the most powerful storms on record to hit the continental United States.

Verizon is the largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers.  The U.S. wireless industry is concentrated in the hands of three mobile carriers due to several mergers in recent years: T-Mobile TMUS.O, which in April completed its $23 billion merger with Sprint Corp to solidify its position in the United States; AT&T Inc T.N, and Verizon.

Verizon has not historically invested in prepaid compared with its rivals, such as T-Mobile, which revamped its MetroPCS prepaid brand and bought Sprint, which had a large prepaid business.  Verizon\u2019s purchase of Tracfone comes at a time when the pandemic has ravaged the economy and Americans are cutting back on spending.

The results underscore the company\u2019s focus on strengthening its core wireless business in a highly competitive U.S. market by also adding free streaming content to its unlimited plans.  Verizon said earlier this week that it would offer a free one-year subscription to Walt Disney Co's DIS.N soon-to-be-launched Disney+ streaming service, taking aim at rival AT&T Inc T.N that is set to launch streaming service HBO Max later this month.  \u201cWe added Apple Music and will now have Disney+. As we make it easier for people to step up into unlimited, that brings value for us as well,\u201d Verizon Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis told Reuters.  Verizon introduced four new pricing plans for its unlimited packages in the third quarter, starting at $35, and expanded its 5G services to four new cities, taking the total to 15.  That helped add 615,000 postpaid customers in the latest quarter, well above analysts\u2019 estimates of 527,000, according to research firm FactSet.  Postpaid subscribers, or those who pay monthly bills, are valuable to telecom companies as they provide a steady stream of revenue and tend to stick longer than prepaid users.

Armstrong\u2019s departure came after The Wall Street Journal reported people within Oath felt they did not have enough access to Verizon\u2019s wireless subscriber data to improve Oath\u2019s advertising.  Verizon had said that about 10,400 employees will leave the company by the middle of next year as part of its voluntary separation program. The employees will get a salary of up to 60 weeks, bonus and benefits, depending on their length of service.  The New York based-company said the severance charge was mainly due to the buyouts announced on Monday as well as other headcount reductions.
