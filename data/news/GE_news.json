- General Electric Co GE.N has hired an investment bank to organize an auction for its digital assets, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday citing people familiar with the matter.  FILE PHOTO: The General Electric logo is pictured on working helmets during a visit at the General Electric offshore wind turbine plant in Montoir-de-Bretagne, near Saint-Nazaire, western France, November 21, 2016. REUTERS\/Stephane Mahe\/File Photo  GE\u2019s multibillion-dollar digital business, which includes its Predix software system and applications, has been struggling with technical issues and weakening sales.  GE has been seeking partners to invest in GE Digital as it narrowed the target markets for the division and abandoned plans to build a cloud platform, instead partnering with Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O clouds.  Faced with cash constraints and falling profits at its large power business, GE chose to reduce investment in the digital unit and focus on partnerships.  The Wall Street Journal report did not reveal the exact assets for sale or the potential deal value.GE declined to comment.  Former GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt invested more than $4 billion in GE Digital and placed it at the strategic center of what he called GE\u2019s new role as a \u201cdigital industrial company.\u201d  But technical issues and competition from less costly systems slowed the unit\u2019s growth, forcing GE to shift strategy.  The unit, which became a standalone business in 2015, has not reported profit and loss as other GE units do. It posted revenue of $4 billion last year, a 12 percent increase from 2016, GE said.  But growth has slowed. Revenue growth was flat in the latest quarter, compared with a year ago, and new orders fell 23 percent, GE said earlier this month.  GE also has been laying off programmers at the GE Digital\u2019s San Ramon, California, headquarters.  The potential sale of digital assets comes amid a broader GE restructuring. The Boston-based conglomerate said in June that it plans to spin off its healthcare business and divest its stake in oil-services firm Baker Hughes BHGE.N, effectively breaking up the 126-year-old company.  The slimmed-down company under Chief Executive John Flannery will focus on jet engines, power plants and renewable energy, which GE hopes will reward battered shareholders who have seen the stock lose more than half its value over the past 20 years.  GE shares were up 0.7 percent at $13.14 in afternoon trading on Monday.","1":"July 29 (Reuters) - General Electric Co reported $2.18 billion in quarterly losses on Wednesday, hurt by weakness in its aviation and power units due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but its free cash outflow came in better than expected.  Free cash outflow from industrial operations totalled $2.1 billion, it said.  Loss per share from continuing operations came in at 27 cents in the second quarter ended June 30, compared with 3 cents a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, GE reported a loss of 15 cents per share.  Total revenue fell 24% to $17.75 billion.

FILE PHOTO: The General Electric logo is pictured on the General Electric offshore wind turbine plant in Montoir-de-Bretagne, near Saint-Nazaire, western France, November 21, 2016. REUTERS\/Stephane Mahe\/File Photo  The U.S. industrial conglomerate said it would restructure its power unit, and said it faced a deeper accounting probe as new Chief Executive Larry Culp moved to try to revive the struggling company.  GE shares were down 10 percent, dropping below $10 to touch their lowest point since early 2009. Shares of GE, which was booted from the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average earlier this year, are now down more than 40 percent this year and have lost two-thirds of their value since the end of 2016.  For longtime shareholders, Tuesday\u2019s third-quarter report delivered another bitter pill. Cash-needy GE all but eliminated its quarterly dividend, slashing it to a penny a share from 12 cents.  The dividend cut marks a major shift for GE, whose shares regularly offered a higher dividend yield than the S&P 500 for about the past 15 years.  GE\u2019s $4.17 billion dividend cut is the eighth largest in the history of S&P 500 companies, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at Standard & Poor\u2019s.  GE also holds title to the largest dividend reduction, according to Silverblatt, for its $8.9 billion cut in February 2009 during the throes of the financial crisis, when Jeff Immelt was CEO.  GE also lays claims to the ninth spot for dividend reductions, for the $4.16 billion cut made about a year ago under recently departed CEO John Flannery. That gives GE three spots in the top 10 for Silverblatt\u2019s list of biggest-ever cuts.  At its peak, GE lavished shareholders with more than $12 billion a year in dividends. Next year it will pay out less than $500 million.  GE\u2019s once-fat payout helped cushion shareholders from the stock\u2019s rocky performance. Over the past decade GE shares have slumped nearly 50 percent, but its total return, including reinvested dividends, was just negative 26 percent.  Now shareholders will no longer be able to bank on the safety net of a rich dividend.  Once the biggest U.S. company by market value, GE\u2019s market capitalization fell below $90 billion on Tuesday, less than one-sixth of its level in 2000.  The declining market cap means the influence of the one-time economic bellwether on the benchmark S&P 500 has also fallen dramatically. Its impact in the S&P 500 now is less than 1\/10th that of the influence of Apple, the biggest U.S. company with a market value eclipsing $1 trillion.  On Tuesday, GE reported a loss of $22.8 billion for the third quarter, as it wrote down $22 billion in goodwill because promised profits from its power unit are now unlikely.  GE did not cut its earnings forecast for the year from the most recent $1.00 to $1.07 per share.  But analysts are bracing for another decline in annual earnings, according to Refinitiv data, which would continue a steady decline for GE\u2019s earnings.","3":"(This version of the story has been refiled to correct to $300 billion in paragraph 7.)  NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A group of investors in U.S. conglomerate General Electric (GE) has publicly opposed its plans to buy a stake in a Kenyan coal-fired plant, claiming the project would damage the environment and undermine efforts to fight global warming.  In a public letter to GE, nearly five dozen institutional and individual shareholders called on the company to reverse course on its intentions to purchase a 20 percent stake in a planned 1,000-megawatt coal plant on Kenya\u2019s Lamu island.  The move follows years of controversy over the Kenyan government\u2019s plans to build East Africa\u2019s first coal-fired power plant on Lamu, a United Nations World Heritage site.  The project has divided communities, and environmentalists fear the plant will destroy the marine environment of the region, a tourist destination that is one of the best-preserved Swahili settlements.  It was unclear how of much GE stock the letter\u2019s signatories hold. The information was not included in the missive, and their spokeswoman said she did not have the data.  GE did not immediately answer an emailed request for comments.  Among those signing the letter was the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, an association of more than 70 United Kingdom-based public sector pension funds with about $300 billion in assets under management. Also signing were several religious groups.  \u201cWe are alarmed by apparent risks involved with the coal plant\u2019s construction and operations,\u201d said the letter, delivered to GE on Wednesday.  \u201cThe plant will negatively impact human health as coal production releases toxic pollution into the air and leaves behind ash that can contaminate groundwater supplies,\u201d it said.  The plans also are \u201cat odds\u201d with GE\u2019s stated support of the 2015 Paris agreement to fight climate change, it said.  \u201cBringing on plants that incorporate marginally improved technology but will lock in the use of coal for decades is the wrong direction - for Kenyans and for the world\u2019s climate,\u201d it said.  Kenya promised to cut carbon emissions 30 percent by 2030 as part of the agreement in Paris, where nearly 200 countries agreed to fight global warming.  Such activism by shareholders rarely has the desired effect, said Jonathan Karpoff, professor of finance at the Foster School of Business at the University of Washington.  \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely to have a significant impact on the firm\u2019s decision or value,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \u201cIf it does sway the decision, it was a coin-flip of an investment to begin with.\u201d  GE signed an agreement in May to design and help build the plant along with Amu Power, a consortium contracted with delivering the $2 billion project.  With the deal, GE, through its affiliates, also will acquire a stake in Amu.","4":"April 29 (Reuters) - General Electric Co reported a 7.6% drop in first-quarter revenue, hurt by weakness in its aviation and power units due to the coronavirus pandemic, and fell short of its own free cash flow targets for the quarter.

REUTERS\/Stephane Mahe\/Files  Valued at close to $580 billion at the turn of the millennium, GE has dropped to around $125 billion and it was surpassed in value by 3M Co MMM.N in January for the first time since the 1970s.  At one point last week, the gap between GE and fellow U.S. industrial Honeywell International Inc HON.N was $6 billion, or 5 percent. The difference between GE and United Tech Corp's UTX.N market values fell to $15 billion.  (GRAPHIC: GE Market value - reut.rs\/2D6JFB5)  Helping to narrow the gap is a 45 percent slide in GE stock over 2017 and a 16 percent fall this year.  Driven in value by a series of investments in several sectors during the 1990s, GE is now paying the price for focusing outside its traditional industrial manufacturing turf, while its rivals have enjoyed a more steady ascent thanks to a sharper focus on their industrial roots.  \u201cAll the large-cap diversified industrials like Honeywell, United Technologies and 3M to name a few, have benefited from some of the money that\u2019s come out of GE,\u201d said JPMorgan analyst Steve Tusa, who has a five-star rating on Thomson Reuters Eikon for recommendation performance.  \u201cYou\u2019re really talking about maybe a mid-teens stock at 2020 ... $20 I think is a very long-term target that really isn\u2019t in the equation at this point,\u201d Tusa said of GE\u2019s shares, which closed at $14.64 on Monday.  Tusa rates GE\u2019s stock \u201cunderweight\u201d with a price target of $14.  But some analysts are optimistic about GE\u2019s stock and future prospects.  William Blair & Co analyst Nicholas Heymann believes that the worse could be over for GE, and its shares are likely to begin stabilizing before moving higher as 2018 progresses.  \u201cI think GE shares have been a bit oversold due to excessive fears about liquidity,\u201d Heymann wrote in a note.  Heymann cites higher oil prices, improving performance of GE\u2019s aviation and healthcare businesses, and the recent nomination of three \u201cexceptionally talented\u201d directors to GE\u2019s board. He has an \u201coutperform\u201d rating on the stock.  GE shares slid even after the company replaced Jeff Immelt as CEO last August with John Flannery. His turnaround plan, which includes cutting jobs, slashing GE\u2019s dividend and a possible break-up of the conglomerate, is likely to take a year or more to show results.  When Immelt took over in September 2001, GE was the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company. But during his tenure, which ended July 2017, the stock price fell about 40 percent.  Over Jack Welch\u2019s stint as CEO from 1981 to 2001, GE\u2019s value rose from $13 billion to several hundred billions of dollars. Welch has since written or co-written bestselling books on management.  (GRAPHIC: GE share performance under three different CEOs - reut.rs\/2Fh6rfu)  GE\u2019s stock trades at roughly 14 times its forecasted earnings, well below the multiples of its peers, as the graphic below shows. The number helps investors gauge the value of a company relative to its earnings.  Saint Paul, Minnesota-based 3M, best known for its Post-it notes and Scotch tape, saw its stock rise nearly 32 percent last year thanks to strong results that helped the company lift its yearly earnings forecast three times.  Honeywell\u2019s stock also rose around 32 percent in 2017, as the company sold more aircraft parts and as its energy customers bought more industrial equipment. Its warehouse automation equipment and software benefited from an ecommerce boom.

Despite flat demand for new natural gas power plants, they said, GE Power\u2019s revenue and profit would rise.  FILE PHOTO: The General Electric logo is pictured on the General Electric offshore wind turbine plant in Montoir-de-Bretagne, near Saint-Nazaire, western France, November 21, 2016. REUTERS\/Stephane Mahe\/File Photo  Showing data from financial firm Lazard and other sources, their presentation said natural gas, coal and even some nuclear power plants were the lowest-cost producers of electricity on the planet, cheaper than wind or solar.  \u201cGas is the most economical energy source today,\u201d one slide read. In the days following the conference, GE\u2019s shares rose 2 percent.  But GE\u2019s forecast turned out to be a mirage.  Rather than rising, GE Power\u2019s profit fell 45 percent last year, forcing GE to slash its overall profit outlook and cut its dividend for only the second time since the Great Depression. Its shares have plunged more than 50 percent since the March forecast. Former CEO Jeff Immelt was replaced in August.  John Flannery, GE\u2019s new chief executive, blamed the forecast, along with poor management and other factors, for the power business meltdown. In January, he warned the pain would continue this year \u201cand potentially be worse than expected.\u201d  What GE has not emphasized is that wind and solar now cost substantially less than gas and other conventional energy sources - and have for years, according to a widely respected energy cost report Lazard has published since 2008.  GE said Lazard was one data source for its March forecast, which also weighed the high efficiency of GE\u2019s latest gas power plants and other factors. GE said cost \u201cis not the only predictor\u201d of the power source utilities will choose. They may also value the reliability of fossil fuels over wind and solar.  \u201cWe have a rigorous financial planning process,\u201d GE said in response to questions from Reuters.  But according to more than a dozen former executives, rivals and energy experts interviewed by Reuters, GE\u2019s reading of the market left the company deeply vulnerable to the sudden drop in demand for conventional power plants, as sales of wind and solar surged.  \u201cThere are just fewer gas turbines being bought,\u201d one former GE executive said. \u201cThe market is not flat, it\u2019s down.\u201d  Power is not GE\u2019s only problem. Its financing arm, GE Capital, took a massive, unexpected charge that contributed to a nearly $10 billion loss in the fourth quarter and prompted U.S. regulators to broaden an ongoing probe of its accounting practices. Profit also fell sharply at GE\u2019s separate oil and gas and locomotive businesses last year, and Flannery has suggested he may break up the company.  But power is one of GE\u2019s oldest and largest businesses, and supplied 60 percent of the conglomerate\u2019s profit as recently as 2016. Now, GE is cutting 12,000 jobs, 18 percent of the unit\u2019s workforce, after announcing 6,500 job cuts in early 2016.  On Wednesday, GE Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller warned of \u201ca little bit more noise\u201d at GE Power, calling 2018 \u201ca reset and stabilization year\u201d for the division.  She declined to predict when GE Power would regain double-digit profit margins it had in 2016, and said turning it around \u201cwill take a good 12 to 18 months.\u201d  DOUBLING DOWN  GE doubled down on fossil fuel in 2015 with the $10.3 billion purchase of French group Alstom\u2019s power business. The deal expanded GE\u2019s exposure to gas, coal and nuclear power just as solar costs fell below those of gas-powered plants, according to Lazard.  The Alstom deal added 65,000 employees to GE\u2019s payroll and dozens of factories and service centers around the globe at a time when GE was trying to cut costs.  Orders for GE\u2019s newest, large gas-fired turbines have fallen 35 percent in the two years since the deal closed, and industry estimates show demand for conventional plants is unlikely to hit 2017 levels again for at least a decade.  The cost gap between renewable and conventional power is still widening, and some utilities already are mothballing older fossil plants, using them only to supplement wind and solar.  Other companies also were hit by the decline in sales. But competitors Siemens AG and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems were cautious. Paul Browning, Chief Executive of MHPS North America, said his company watched wind and solar power costs fall 12 percent a year for more than a decade.  \u201cWe did see a lot of this coming and didn\u2019t make acquisitions or build up a lot of facilities, people or inventory,\u201d Browning said in an interview.  While Alstom gave GE more than $14 billion more in annual revenue, Alstom\u2019s profit margins were less than one-third of GE\u2019s. Immelt saw that as an opportunity.  \u201cIf we thought this was a 6 percent margin business that we couldn\u2019t dramatically improve, we are not going to do it,\u201d Immelt said of the Alstom purchase in May 2014. \u201cWe are basically in similar businesses in the same market, and we run our business at a 20 percent margin.\u201d  But regulators required GE to sell the power-plant service arm of Alstom, a Florida-based company called Power Systems Manufacturing that had long been a competitor to GE, Mitsubishi and Siemens.  GE, which had counted on that business serving a large base of plants around the world to make Alstom more profitable, bid aggressively on service deals to avoid losing them to competitors, according to three people familiar with the bidding.  That has raised concerns among investors that it is locked into service contracts that will not be profitable.  Rather than improving Alstom\u2019s margins, GE Power\u2019s margin plunged to 7.7 percent last year from 21 percent before the acquisition.  In response to questions from Reuters, GE said lucrative income from fixing downed power plants fell by half last year, a major hit to profits.  But it defended the Alstom purchase, which instantly gave it 50 percent more plants to service, something that would take half a century to build up from scratch. Since it is a long-term business, GE said, and \u201cwe have opportunity to improve the performance in the future.\u201d  LIGHTING UP THE WORLD... FOR NOW  GE\u2019s power plants generate one-third of the world\u2019s electricity, giving it a large installed base for services revenue.  But industry experts point out that GE\u2019s gas power plants are mainly older F-Class units, rather than the new, larger H-Class turbines. Older gas-fired plants often cannot compete with wind and solar, especially when governments provide subsidies, said Stuart Slade, director of consulting at market research firm Forecast International.  \u201cThere are a lot of single-cycle gas plants being mothballed,\u201d Slade said.  Alstom inflicted other blows: New Alstom orders fell off in the 18 months before the deal closed as customers held back on purchases. That gave competitors scope to gain market share, according to people familiar with the sales competitions.  GE has sold the largest number F-Class power plants. But it is in third place behind Mitsubishi and Siemens in competition for the newest, largest and most fuel-efficient H-Class turbines, according to McCoy Power Reports, an industry research company.  Orders for all of GE Power\u2019s plants and services have fallen 13 percent since 2016, a decline that accelerated at the end of last year. GE also wrote off some of the equipment it built up as part of an $850 million charge it took in the fourth quarter. GE did not rule out further write offs, in response to questions from Reuters.  Miller and GE Power Chief Executive Russell Stokes have said the problems are fixable, and the company acknowledged in a recent strategy paper that wind and solar are a fast-growing part of the world\u2019s energy supply.  Still, GE downplays the threat to its bulked up fossil fuel product line. Despite rapid growth of wind and solar, it says, two-thirds of power generation will come from gas, coal and nuclear plants over the next decade.  \u201cThe transformation will not happen overnight,\u201d GE said in the strategy paper.","10":"Jan 26 (Reuters) - General Electric Co reported a better-than-expected free cash flow for the fourth quarter on Tuesday and forecast 2021 cash flow to be about $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion, as it benefits from a recovery at its power and renewable energy units.

REUTERS\/Vincent Kessler  The Boston-based industrial conglomerate reported cash outflow of $2.1 billion from industrial operations, a tad lower than a quarter ago and considerably below its own estimate of between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion for the quarter.  All of its industrial units reported lower sales and a double-digit decline in orders during the quarter. The steepest fall was at its aviation unit, usually GE\u2019s most profitable and most cash-generative business segment.  The company\u2019s shares tumbled 5% to $6.54 in midday trading.  The aviation unit, which makes engines for Boeing Co BA.N and Airbus SE AIR.PA, had already been reeling from the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX planes. With the pandemic bringing global travel to a virtual halt, its troubles have worsened.  Boeing on Wednesday said it would further cut the production of commercial jets and delay the planned increase in the build rates of 737 MAX to early 2022 from 2021.  GE, meanwhile, is taking heart from an improvement in flight departures globally, which it expects would boost the unit\u2019s services business.  \u201cWe\u2019ve started to see some early signs of improvement in June and July,\u201d said Chief Executive Lawrence Culp. \u201cNonetheless, we remain cautious going into the second half, given the uncertainty associated with the pandemic.\u201d  A recovery in the aviation business is critical for Culp, who is trying to turn around the company by improving free cash flow and cutting debt.  While the company sees a slow recovery in the aviation business, it expects free cash flow to be better in the second half of the year and turn positive in 2021.  With the pandemic-induced economic recession hammering sales, companies are focusing on improving decremental margin, or the effect a decline in sales has on income, by cutting costs.  GE reduced aviation headcount by 11% during the quarter as part of a plan to cut 25% of its global workforce this year. The cuts helped improve decremental margin at the unit to 59% from 62% in the first quarter.  Analysts at Gordon Haskett Research Advisors, however, dubbed the progress as \u201cweak\u201d, warning the lagging impact of the pandemic could further hurt the performance of the services part of GE\u2019s aviation business in the third quarter.  GE said it is launching a program to fully monetize its stake in Baker Hughes BKR.N over about three years to reduce its debt.

A General Electric (GE) sign is seen during the China International Import Expo (CIIE), at the National Exhibition and Convention Center in Shanghai, China November 6, 2018. REUTERS\/Aly Song  Culp is facing tough questions about GE\u2019s financial strength and profit outlook after being named CEO on Oct. 1 with a mandate to turn around the 126-year-old conglomerate.  \u201cWe have no higher priority right now than bringing leverage levels down,\u201d Culp told CNBC. \u201cWe have plenty of opportunity to do that through asset sales.\u201d  Culp said GE also was trying to get \u201ca better grounding in reality\u201d in its ailing power unit.  Last month, GE posted a quarterly loss of $22.8 billion, cut its annual dividend to just 4 cents a share and told investors it was facing a deepening federal accounting probe. The power unit lost $631 million in the quarter and GE wrote down $22 billion in goodwill because expected future profits in the unit now appear unlikely.  Since then, some analysts have questioned GE\u2019s liquidity and slashed their target prices for the stock. Culp said he thought the power business was \u201cgetting close\u201d to bottoming out after more than a year of declining revenue and profit.  Some GE bonds are now trading far below par, and its five-year credit default swap rose to a bid price of 176.5 basis points and the upfront price GE5YUSAX=MGGE5YUSAX=R to 3.4 percent on Monday, according to data from IHS Markit and Refinitiv.  The spike in credit default swap costs comes as short positions in GE debt have risen to $958 million from $238 million in December 2017. The most shorted debt security is the 5 percent perpetual bond 369604BQ5=, which has no maturity date, and has seen short positions more than double to $442 million from mid-September. Analysts at Credit Suisse and CFRA cut price their stock targets prices on Monday from $12 to $10 and $9, respectively, citing uncertainly about GE's earnings and margins, and potential liabilities and writedowns at its insurance and power units. JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa last week cut his target to $6 from $10.  \u201cWe do not think the stock \u2018works\u2019 until confidence is restored,\u201d Credit Suisse analyst John Walsh wrote on Monday.  GE shares closed down 6.9 percent at $7.99 on the New York Stock Exchange after falling as low as $7.72.  GE had $114 billion in debt at the end of the third quarter, 3.7 times its equity and more than four times the industry average debt-to-equity ratio of 0.77, Refinitiv data shows. High debt levels can increase a company\u2019s risk of default.  Former GE CEO John Flannery announced $20 billion in planned asset sales a year ago, but many are either still in the works or have not yielded enough cash to bring debt in line with peers.  GE's largest deal so far, merging its railroad locomotive unit with Wabtec Corp WAB.N, netted just $2.9 billion in proceeds and 9.9 percent of the combined company.  Culp said GE was considering potential deals involving its \u201ccrown jewel\u201d aviation unit, which shares technology with power, but such moves were not a high priority.  \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t say \u2018no\u2019 for all time to various options,\u201d but breaking the unit out, monetizing it or raising equity were \u201cnot high on our list\u201d of strategic moves, Culp said.","30":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - General Electric Co was sued on Friday by a shareholder who accused the conglomerate of concealing mounting insurance liabilities and a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe, saying it cost shareholders tens of billions of dollars.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The complaint filed by the Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters Pension Fund appears to be the first proposed shareholder class action accusing GE of securities fraud since the company surprised investors with two negative announcements last month.  On Jan. 16, GE said it would take a $6.2 billion pretax charge and set aside $15 billion in reserves to help cover insurance operations held by its GE Capital unit, mainly concerning long-term-care insurance policies.  Eight days later, it said the SEC had begun probing how it handled its insurance obligations, as well as how it accounted for service agreements related to power plants, jet engines and other equipment.  Other defendants in the lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York, include GE Chief Executive Officer John Flannery, his predecessor Jeffrey Immelt, Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller and her predecessor Jeffrey Bornstein.  \u201cThe company will defend itself against these claims,\u201d a GE spokeswoman said.  Daniel Berger, a lawyer for the plaintiff, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The lawsuit seeks damages on behalf of shareholders from Feb. 26, 2013, to Jan. 24, 2018.  GE\u2019s market value fell to roughly $143 billion by the end of the class period from more than $290 billion in July 2016.  The Boston-based company has faced earlier shareholder lawsuits over its falling stock price.  Long-term-care insurance has become a more troublesome and costly business, including for the Genworth Financial Inc business that GE spun off in 2004, as policyholders live longer.  The complaint said GE knew or should have known it was not immune from that trend, and quoted from analysts covering GE who wrote that it was \u201chard to believe\u201d or \u201chard to imagine\u201d that the company suddenly discovered its problems.  GE stopped writing long-term-care insurance contracts in 2006, but has said it provides reinsurance on about 300,000 policies.

Through their CFM joint-venture, Safran and GE are changing models to the LEAP engine, which has faced some delivery delays. The engines power the latest version of Boeing 737 and about half of the A320neo line sold by Airbus, which said earlier it planned to raise its 2019 output target to 63 a month from 60.  \u201cAs of today, we are not in a position to commit ourselves to higher volumes,\u201d Safran CEO Philippe Petitcolin said.  \u201cWe understand the needs of our client and if we are able to respond favourably we will do so, but we don\u2019t want to start discussions on a commitment beyond what was agreed 18 months ago, (before)...early 2019,\u201d Petitcolin told reporters.  It was not immediately clear whether a higher Airbus target of 63 jets a month, which has been circulating for some time, had already been anticipated in those previous discussions.  Petitcolin said Safran was predicting 1,100 LEAP engine deliveries in 2018 - a number slightly shy of GE\u2019s forecast - as a matter of caution, but did not exclude output reaching 1,200.  Safran has previously adopted a conservative view on production increases as engine makers adapt to the new models and put increased demands on an already stressed supply chain.

Joyce said, in reply to a question, that he had not yet managed to reconcile the various views on market forecasts for the middle of the jetliner market.  The business case for potential engine manufacturers would depend on how many variants Boeing plans to offer, he said.  GE has the largest stake of any engine maker in the industry's status quo, since it supplies engines for best-selling single-aisle aircraft to both Boeing and Airbus through its CFM joint venture with France's Safran SAF.PA.  Industry experts say that means GE has the lowest strategic interest among engine makers in supporting the mid-market project, though most expect it to take part in the program if it goes ahead - especially if Boeing only chooses one supplier.  Joyce reiterated he was open-minded about whether the program should have one engine supplier or two, but that GE would not take part if there were three suppliers on board.  GE competes with Rolls-Royce RR.L and Pratt & Whitney, which some in the industry speculate could co-operate on the project.  The mid-market plane would sit between single-aisle and wide-body jets and compete partly with the Airbus A321neo, the European planemaker\u2019s largest single-aisle jet.  Asked whether the mid-market plane could damage the business case for the LEAP engine, which CFM offers on the A321neo and other Airbus single-aisle models, Joyce it would not, based on the latest proposals for the aircraft, but did not elaborate.","38":"Traders work at the post where Baker Hughes is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., May 2, 2016.

REUTERS\/Alwyn Scott\/File Photo  But perhaps the more notable endorsement of Culp\u2019s efforts to turn around the fortunes of the 127-year-old conglomerate has come from a more skeptical crowd: bondholders.  GE\u2019s 10 largest outstanding U.S. bonds are up an average of 11.73% in the new year, besting the ICE BAML index of bonds rated BBB, which has a total return 6.5 3% in that time. That\u2019s a stunning turn around for a basket of debt that had swooned so heavily last year that the bond market was rife with chatter that GE might lose its investment-grade credit rating.  Earnings on April 30 showed the Boston-based company still had a way to go in its turnaround efforts, but Culp\u2019s plan to reduce the company\u2019s $110 billion debt load has nevertheless spurred interest from bondholders.  The rise in bond prices is \u201cdefinitely a recognition of the fact (Culp) does have a plan and that maybe things have bottomed out for GE,\u201d said Mark Jackson, portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital.  \u201cThey have someone who recognizes that they need to delever and adjust cash flows and become a better operating company... Now there\u2019s someone in charge who has a plan to actually accomplish those two very pressing needs.\u201d  Culp was appointed last October just before GE was downgraded by credit rating agencies to just three notches above \u201cjunk\u201d status on the grounds that its debt load looked untenable as its earnings faltered. GE\u2019s share price has fallen by more than two-thirds since 2016 and last year it reported a $23 billion loss.  Since taking over, Culp has sold GE assets including its biopharma business to rival U.S. conglomerate Danaher Corp for $21.4 billion. Culp in March forecast that 2019 earnings would be below analyst expectations and reiterated on Wednesday the company will likely have weaker quarters for the rest of the year after a surprisingly good start in the first quarter.  For now, the plan to delever may be enough.  \u201cWe started (buying the debt) when they announced the sale of their healthcare unit,\u201d said Monica Erickson, portfolio manager at DoubleLine Capital. \u201cThey\u2019re doing the right things, but it remains to be seen whether it all works out or not.\u201d  Jackson also said he had bought the debt recently at least in part because of Culp\u2019s potential to revive the company. \u201cYes I do have some exposure,\u201d he said.  \u201cI wish I could say that I got in at the wides, but that would not be true,\u201d said Jackson, referring to the moment when GE\u2019s credit spreads were the most aggravated.  GE is not the only company under pressure to reduce its debt balance.  From 2015-2018, as low interest rates enabled companies to take on more debt, U.S. non-financial company leverage rose to 15 times earnings from 12 times just after the 2008 financial crisis, according to research from Moody\u2019s Investors Service.  Like GE, some of those companies are now looking to lighten that load. AB InBev has announced plans to reduce its $100 billion debt load, and Kraft Heinz, Verizon Communications and AT&T have all put themselves on debt diets this year.  While the risk of distraction may be high now that the Federal Reserve has paused its rate hikes, \u201ccompanies that did these big mega-deals and levered up to do them,\u201d said Jackson, now must \u201clive up to their commitments to delever.\u201d","41":"FILE PHOTO: Miguel Gutierrez, chairman of Argentina's state-run petroleum company YPF SA poses for a portrait in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S., October 25, 2017.

The unit - which will be known as YPF Luz and operate independently from the oil company - will raise its capacity to 4,500 megawatts per hour by 2022 or 2023, Gutierrez said. That would make it Argentina\u2019s third-largest generator. Currently, it is the fifth-largest and produces 1,800 megawatts per hour.  Gutierrez said that once the new company finishes its development stage, it could list on the local stock exchange.","42":"KHARTOUM (Reuters) - The Sudanese government signed a memorandum of understanding with General Electric GE.N on Thursday aimed at increasing power generation by up to 470 megawatts (MW) as Sudan struggles to emerge from an economic crisis and long economic isolation.  GE said in a statement it planned to deliver electricity to about 600,000 households through mobile turbines that can be installed within months and the rehabilitation of three existing power plants.  The company said it was also exploring cooperation on further power projects as well as health projects including the modernisation of radiology, cardiology and oncology infrastructure and healthcare in rural areas.  \u201cIt has been almost three decades since we have seen such important companies engage with Sudan,\u201d Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok was quoted as saying in a joint press release.  The statement gave no detail on financial terms or costs. Sudan\u2019s cabinet said on Wednesday it was planning to boost output at a power plant in El Fula, West Kordofan, at a total cost of $915 million.  Sudan is in political transition after former leader Omar al-Bashir was removed from power in April 2019 following months of protests. A government of technocrats is trying to steer the country towards elections under a military-led ruling council.  International sanctions imposed during Bashir\u2019s long rule isolated Sudan\u2019s economy from much of the outside world, contributing to an economic crisis that has continued after his ouster.  There are daily power cuts, most of the country is not connected to the grid, and the healthcare sector is in a state of collapse.  Though the United States dropped trade sanctions in 2018, Sudan remains on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism, which complicates access to foreign financing and debt relief. International banks and companies have been slow to engage.  Sudan has been pushing to be removed from the list for more than a year.","43":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - General Electric Co last year eliminated bonuses for its senior managers for the first time in its 126-year history, saving millions of dollars after losing money in 2017, the industrial conglomerate said on Monday.

The changes led to steep declines in compensation and reflected the company\u2019s poor results in 2017, according to the company\u2019s annual proxy.  Former CEO Jeff Immelt, who stepped down on Aug. 1, received $8.1 million in 2017, down from $21.3 million the year before. Compensation includes salary, bonus, stock, options and other income. GE eliminated Immelt\u2019s 2017 target bonus of $5.4 million and cut about $1 million from his salary.  Current Chief Executive John Flannery earned $9 million in salary and other compensation last year. The company eliminated a $3 million target bonus for him, GE said.  The company also eliminated bonuses for former Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein, former Vice Chair of Business Innovations Beth Comstock and John Rice, the former CEO of GE\u2019s global growth organization. The savings on bonuses and other compensation totaled more than $10 million.  The exception was David Joyce, head of GE\u2019s aviation business, who received about $5.2 million. While that was down from $12.6 million in 2016, Joyce received a $1.4 million bonus.  \u201cWe are holding leaders accountable for performance,\u201d GE said in the proxy, noting operating profit fell 11 percent and that the amount in its bonus pool fell 75 percent. GE reported a net loss of 72 cents a share last year.  \u201cConsistent with this commitment to align pay to performance, the bonuses we paid were concentrated in Aviation and Healthcare, which had outstanding years,\u201d the company said.  GE said in the proxy it was not changing compensation for board members, other than to add a $30,000 annual payment for members of the new finance committee.  Directors receive $275,000 a year, and additional amounts depending on their committee assignments, the company said.","44":"Feb 26 (Reuters) - General Electric Co on Monday nominated three new candidates for its board of directors, ahead of a shareholder meeting in April.

Culp\u2019s comments at a Morgan Stanley Laguna Conference were more upbeat than the outlook GE provided in July, when it expected free cash flow to be better in the second half of the year.  Analysts expect GE third-quarter cash outflow to be about $656 million and cash inflow of about $1.17 billion in the fourth quarter, according to Refinitiv data.  The Boston-based industrial conglomerate reported cash outflow of $2.1 billion from industrial operations in the second quarter as the coronavirus pandemic pummeled demand in its aviation business.  Culp described the June quarter as the \u201ctoughest\u201d quarter. While GE\u2019s markets have stabilized in the current quarter, recovery remains sluggish, he said.  A recovery in the aviation business, usually GE\u2019s most profitable and most cash-generative business segment, is critical for Culp, who is trying to turn around the company by improving free cash flow and cutting debt. Free cash flow represents the amount of cash a business has after paying all business-related expenses.  In a response to the pandemic-induced turmoil, GE is cutting $2 billion in costs. Culp said capital spending is also being slashed.  \u201cWe are really not waiting for the markets to come back and put the wind we had in our sails,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know this is going to be a self-help story for a little bit longer.\u201d  Culp said the company\u2019s performance in the second half of the year will set the stage for a positive cash flow in 2021 as well.","46":"Slideshow ( 4 images )  ZURICH (Reuters) - General Electric plans to cut around 450 jobs at two Swiss sites to help address \u201cchallenges on the global energy markets\u201d, the U.S. industrial conglomerate said on Monday.

New Chief Executive Larry Culp cautioned, however, that the results stemmed largely from the timing of payments to suppliers and from customers, and did not alter GE\u2019s financial outlook for the year.  \u201cOne quarter is a data point not a trend,\u201d Culp said on a conference call with analysts.  GE\u2019s profit from continuing operations more than tripled as sales rose in GE\u2019s aviation, oil and gas, and healthcare units. At the same time, negative cash flow from industrial business was $1.2 billion, much less than the $2.16 billion outflow that analysts, on average, were expecting.  Culp had set low earnings targets in March and warned that GE\u2019s industrial cash flow could be negative by as much as $2 billion.  GE\u2019s shares rose 4.5% to close at $10.17, after the call. They had risen more than 10% before the market opened.  GE bonds also rallied, extending a recovery in more than $100 billion of GE debt. Yields on dozens of longer-dated issues were at their lowest since Nov. 1. A $1 billion GE Capital bond with a 4% coupon due in July 2035 was up more than 1.5 cents at nearly 87 cents and a yield of 5.2%, compared with a low of 63 cents on the dollar last November to yield more than 8%.  Investors have been keen for a turnaround since GE named Culp last October to restore earnings and improve a stock price that has fallen by more than two-thirds since 2016.  GE took a string of multibillion-dollar writedowns last year, so the slowing in cash outflows in the latest quarter raised hopes that its fortunes have started to improve.

The plane model was grounded worldwide last month after a second fatal accident in less than five months.  Profit margins also contracted at GE\u2019s aviation, power and renewable energy businesses, the three core units that GE plans to retain as it undergoes a break-up announced last year.  A 1.6 percentage point drop in GE\u2019s industrial margins in the quarter is a \u201cstark reminder of the challenges that the company still faces,\u201d said Rene Lipsch, lead GE analyst at Moody\u2019s. He added that he expects margins to be flat or slightly improved by year-end.  GE\u2019s cash balance was boosted mainly the $2.9 billion sale of locomotive business to Wabtec Corp.  Culp has said the 2019 \u201creset\u201d of GE would result in negative cash flow at its most-troubled business, power, through 2020 before turning positive in 2021.

The combined unit will have about 40,000 employees and annual revenue of about $16 billion, GE spokesman Jim Healy said in an interview, compared with $10.2 billion for renewable energy last year.  GE\u2019s renewables business currently comprises on- and offshore wind turbines, plus hydropower. GE\u2019s units handling electrical transmission and distribution grids, battery storage and solar inverters and controls had been in GE\u2019s Power business, which is focused on fossil fuel generation. Regional leaders for renewables will now deal directly with the company\u2019s renewables headquarters in Paris. GE does not make solar panels.  The move is GE\u2019s first big structural shift since October, when it said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice had expanded accounting probes to include a $22 billion writedown of goodwill at GE Power in the third quarter.  To help its ailing power business, GE said in October it would separate natural gas power from coal, nuclear and grid, and named new leaders for the units. Some analysts interpreted the moves as GE preparing its non-gas businesses for sale.  GE\u2019s newest gas turbines are under scrutiny after a broken blade severely damaged a unit in Texas last year, causing a two-month plant outage. The break has forced some utilities to curtail use of their new GE turbines while they await blade replacements, and GE has since said it knew about the problem after a similar blade broke in 2015.  GE\u2019s power division took on added importance to GE\u2019s future earnings after the company announced last year it would focus on jet engines, power plants and renewable energy and dispose of its healthcare unit and majority stake in Baker Hughes, along with other restructuring.  GE\u2019s renewable energy unit contributed about 9 percent of the company\u2019s industrial revenues in 2017, before the integration.

REUTERS\/Stephane Mahe\/File Photo  GE had put the unit, which makes Jenbacher and Waukesha brand reciprocating gas engines, up for sale as part of a three-year plan to exit about $20 billion in industrial assets. GE hopes to book as much as $10 billion in such proceeds this year.  The sale, expected to close in the fourth quarter, highlights the growing demand for reciprocating engines by utilities, which pair them with wind and solar generators. Because the engines start quickly, they can fill in when wind and sun falter and then be shut off when not needed, conserving fuel. Large power turbines cannot start as quickly and so must be kept spinning at partial power even when wind or solar electricity supplies are ample.  \u201cDistributed Power is a terrific asset,\u201d said Ranjan Sen, managing partner at Advent International. \u201cThe business has significant growth potential on a global scale and talented employees all over the world.\u201d  Advent plans to \u201cinvest substantially\u201d in critical areas such as the product portfolio, service network and digitization, he said, to build up the company\u2019s market position.  Advent prevailed against engine maker Cummins CMI.N in the final stages of the auction. Engine makers Kohler and Wartsila WRT1V.HE and investor KKR KKR.N, had dropped out earlier, people close to the matter said.  GE stock slid 2.3 percent to close at $12.75 in New York. While the sale was not likely to have much effect on GE\u2019s stock, it \u201cchecks the box on another divestiture-simplification action by (GE) CEO John Flannery,\u201d said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray.  Advent\u2019s purchase values the unit at about 11.2 times 2018 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of just below $290 million, said a person close to the matter. Last year it posted revenue of $1.3 billion.  Faced with weak profits and calls to be broken up, GE is aggressively cutting costs, selling units and strengthening its balance sheet under a new board and managers.  Selling the industrial gas engine business is expected tohelp streamline GE\u2019s $35 billion-a-year power division, whose profit plunged last year as sales of power plants and services fell sharply.  Jenbacher and Waukesha engines range from 100 kilowatts to 10 megawatts. One of GE\u2019s key customers is the German port city of Kiel, which is using 20 Jenbacher engines to create a 190 megawatt plant, replacing a coal-fired plant opened in 1970, GE said.  The engines will supply heat and electricity to homes and buildings, with power supplemented by nearby wind turbines, GE said. The last of the Jenbachers was delivered in March and the old coal plant is due to shut down next year, GE said.  Finland\u2019s Wartsila, which makes similar engines, dropped out of talks for the unit several weeks ago, as it did not see enough synergies to allow it to pay the mooted price of as much as $3.5 billion, according to a source with knowledge of the discussions.","53":"General Electric Co lacks standing to appeal an unfavorable Patent Trial and Appeal Board decision in a dispute with United Technologies Corp, a federal appeals court said on Wednesday.

GE rejected an approach by Danaher for that business a year ago. But its stance changed after Culp was appointed CEO and GE board\u2019s became more open to a deal, according to people familiar with the negotiations who requested anonymity to discuss them.  As a result, GE will receive some $20 billion in net proceeds which it will use to trim its debt pile, which stood at $121 billion at the end of December.  Both GE\u2019s and Danaher\u2019s shares jumped on news of the deal, though GE still faces significant hurdles in recovering its former corporate glory. It lost two-thirds of its market value in the last two years amid a series of operational and investment missteps.  Among its challenges are mismanagement of orders and operations in its power business, and dealing with its toxic long-term care insurance liabilities in its GE Capital arm.  \u201c(The GE-Danaher deal) unfortunately doesn\u2019t solve the real issues which comes back to power. That\u2019s what took the stock down, and that\u2019s still going to take some time play out,\u201d said Richard Grasfeder, a portfolio manager at Boston Private Wealth LLC, which held about 478,204 shares in GE as of the end of 2018, down from 787,600 shares a year earlier.  Culp said on Monday the sale to Danaher, where he was instrumental in revitalizing the company as its CEO, was a pivotal milestone in efforts to turn around GE, a 126-year old conglomerate.  \u201cIt demonstrates that we are executing on our strategy by taking thoughtful and deliberate action to reduce leverage and strengthen our balance sheet,\u201d Culp said in a statement.  The biopharma sale also propelled a broad rally in GE\u2019s roughly $120 billion of bonds, which had taken a pounding in late 2018 as it became clear that earlier restructuring efforts were falling short and that the company would need to take more aggressive action to address its debt load in particular.  Larry Culp \u201chas earned his stripes. It is clear that nobody in his job before him - John Flannery or Jeff Immelt - would have probably been able to pull off this transaction with Danaher,\u201d William Blair & Co analyst Nicholas Heymann said.  \u201cAnd the price Danaher is paying GE is two times our expectations. This is a home run. It really turns the page now for GE to address liquidity concerns,\u201d Heymann adds.  Until recently, the company had plans to spin off the entire healthcare unit. Culp, however, said in January that GE would sell nearly half of the unit.  Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday that GE will put the initial public offering of the unit on hold until the deal with Danaher closes, expected in the second half of the year.  This would mean that GE is likely to retain access to the earnings and cash flows of the remaining healthcare businesses for a longer period of time, alleviating some cash concerns, even as the power business struggles, said Rene Lipsch, lead GE analyst at Moody\u2019s.  BOOST FOR DANAHER  The purchase is also the biggest yet for Danaher, which has a history of deal-making, and half of its revenue has come from companies it has acquired in the past seven years.  The deal will expand Danaher\u2019s presence in the biopharma industry, providing it with access to tools for research and development of drugs. Shares of the medical equipment maker rose more than 9 percent to a record $124.07.

The biopharma business accounted for 15 percent of GE\u2019s healthcare business revenue in 2018. It makes instruments and software that support the research and development of drugs.  The sale leaves GE\u2019s healthcare unit with its medical device unit, which makes X-ray, CT scan and MRI machines, and its pharmaceuticals diagnostic unit.  The announcement also further eased concerns about GE\u2019s solvency that had grown markedly last year, reflected in a surge in the price for GE credit default swaps (CDS) during the fourth quarter, a form of insurance against default. On Monday, GE\u2019s CDS prices sank to their lowest since mid-October.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Interest in such medicines, which use engineered viruses to carry healthy genetic material into the cells of sick people, has exploded recently as the first wave of gene-fixing drugs reach the market.  That has left some drug companies scrambling for sufficient capacity at a time when the industry is also grappling with shortages of DNA-carrying viral vectors.  GE, better known for making jet engines and turbines, sees an opportunity in the fast-growing field. It aims to build on its existing expertise in biotech manufacturing by delivering a \u201cfactory-in-a-box\u201d service specifically for viral vector-based medicine.  The U.S. conglomerate already makes off-the-shelf modular factories for other complex biological medicines, such as monoclonal antibodies.  Its so-called KUBio factories are cheaper and faster to construct than traditional factories, offering GE a way to win business for its growing life sciences business. Depending on the factory design and the drug being made, an equivalent KUBio could reduce build costs by as much as 50 percent, according to the company.  A spokeswoman said GE was currently in talks with several potential customers for the new off-the-shelf viral vector factories.  GE is also stepping up operations within the wider supply chain that is needed to deliver cell therapies like Novartis\u2019 Kymriah and Gilead Sciences\u2019 Yescarta, both of which were approved in 2017 for treating certain blood cancers.  Last year, for example, GE Healthcare bought British-based Asymptote, a specialist in freezing, preserving and transporting large volumes of living cells.  Overall, GE says it expects to have a $1 billion-a-year gene and cell therapy business by 2025.  The are now more than 700 viral vector-based therapies in clinical trials, spurring demand for biologically secure bioreactors to churn out products.  Since most such treatments are targeted therapies designed for small patient populations, GE is betting that drug companies will prefer its flexible small-scale KUBio units to large traditional factories.","60":"(Adds reporting credit; makes no changes to headline or text)  WASHINGTON, Nov 21 (Reuters) - General Electric Co. and a Vietnamese company on Saturday signed a memorandum of understanding to develop a liquified natural gas power plant, according to GE and a senior Trump administration official.

FILE PHOTO: A traffic light is seen in front of a logo of General Electric at the company's plant in Birr, Switzerland June 17, 2019. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  The 750-megawatt natural-gas-fired plant, known as the Inland Empire Energy Center, uses two of GE\u2019s H-Class turbines, developed only in the last decade, before the company\u2019s successor gas turbine, the flagship HA model, which uses different technology.  The closure illustrates stiff competition in the deregulated energy market as cheap wind and solar supply more electricity, squeezing out fossil fuels. Some utilities say they have no plans to build more fossil plants.  It also highlights the stumbles of Boston-based GE with its first H-Class turbine. The complex, steam-cooled H design takes hours to start, suffered technical problems and sold poorly, experts said.  \u201cWe have made the decision to shut down operation of the Inland Empire Power Plant, which has been operating below capacity for several years, effective at the end of 2019,\u201d GE told Reuters. The plant \u201cis powered by a legacy gas turbine technology ... and is uneconomical to support further.\u201d  GE declined to comment on whether it would take a charge for shutting the plant. GE operates few power plants of its own.  In a filing with the California Energy Commission on Thursday, GE said the plant is \u201cnot designed for the needs of the evolving California market, which requires fast-start capabilities to satisfy peak demand periods.\u201d  GE\u2019s newer HA turbine can power up in under an hour, more quickly than the H to match fluctuating supplies of wind and solar power, GE said. The large market for the H turbine that GE anticipated \u201cdid not develop and has resulted in an orphan technology installation at IEEC,\u201d the filing said.  It added that GE will no longer support or make replacement parts for the H turbine. Only one other plant uses H turbines, Baglan Bay in Wales.  California approved the Inland Energy Center, located in Riverside County, about 75 miles (120.7 km) east of Los Angeles, in 2003 and the plant opened in 2009. Industry experts estimated it cost nearly $1 billion. Similar combined-cycle gas-power plants run for 30 years before being decommissioned, according to a recent study by S&P Global Market Intelligence.  One of the two Inland Empire turbines was mothballed in 2017, cutting the plant\u2019s output to about 376 megawatts, according to the filing and the California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state\u2019s electricity grid. Closing the plant will eliminate about 23 jobs, the filing said.  GE has been promoting its \u201cH-Class\u201d turbines amid a severe downturn in demand for fossil-fuel power plants.  The two \u201cH\u201d turbines being demolished in California differ from GE\u2019s current HA, which uses air cooling, said a former GE engineer familiar with both turbine types.  Still, premature closure of a turbine marketed as \u201cH-Class\u201d is a negative for GE as it struggles to restore profits at its power business, the expert noted. Power, once GE\u2019s largest division, lost $22.8 billion last year as the company grapples with slack demand for fossil-fuel plants. The company is set to lose up to $2 billion in cash this year.  GE is selling the California power plant site to a company that makes battery storage, which is increasingly used to make wind and solar power available when needed, replacing the need for some fossil fuel plants.","63":"(Reuters) - Arcline Investment Management, a U.S. private equity firm founded by former Golden Gate dealmaker Rajeev Amara, said on Thursday it would buy a unit of Baker Hughes BHGE.N, General Electric Co's GE.N oil-servicing subsidiary.

By Mark Miller CHICAGO, July 12 (Reuters) - The decision marked the end of an era: last month, the keepers of the Dow Jones Industrial Average removed General Electric Co , one of the original stocks included in the index when it was created in 1896. The once-mighty GE had become the sixth-smallest member of the 30-component Dow by market value and carried the index\u2019s lowest stock price. The move by S&P Dow Jones Indices reflected the decline of an American industrial icon. But the company\u2019s plunging stock highlights a problem that refuses to go away: too much concentration of employer stock in workplace retirement plans. More than one-third of GE 401(k) plan assets were held in the company\u2019s own shares in 2016, federal filings show. Just 15 years ago, GE was the world\u2019s most valuable public company. But it has struggled in several of its key industrial markets and suffered losses in the financial services business during the global financial meltdown of 2008. GE stock has fallen nearly 80 percent from highs in 2000, serving up a reminder of the risk of holding your employer\u2019s stock in a retirement account. Changes in federal law have encouraged retirement plans to move away from company stock ownership, and a spate of lawsuits also have helped convince many plan sponsors to reduce or eliminate the practice. Data from Vanguard points to an encouraging trend. In 2017, among all account-holders in defined contribution plans administered by the mutual fund giant, 90 percent had no investments in their employer\u2019s shares, either because it was not offered (76 percent) or they chose not to invest in it (14 percent). Five percent had holdings ranging from 1 percent to 20 percent of their plan assets, and 5 percent had concentrated employee stock positions exceeding 20 percent. The industries still most likely to offer company stock were agriculture\/mining and construction (13 percent offered), Vanguard data shows. THE ENRON EFFECT The GE story belies a sharp improvement in diversification by many 401(k) plans over the past decade. As recently as 2007, nearly 25 percent of Vanguard-administered plans had employer stock concentration levels higher than 20 percent. The more recent improvement stems in part from the spectacular 2001 collapse of Enron Corp, which blew away the life savings of thousands of employees holding the company\u2019s stock. The ensuing Pension Protection Act of 2006 required defined contribution plan sponsors to allow participants to diversify holdings away from employer shares, and to notify them of their rights in this area. Most experts say employee retirement portfolios should not hold more than 10 or 15 percent of their employer\u2019s stock. \"Since Enron, many employers have decided this isn\u2019t a good thing for employees - that\u2019s the good news,\u201d said Robert Pozen, a senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management, who recently reviewed federal filings of large retirement plans. (brook.gs\/2m5dwUv) \u201cUnfortunately, quite a few companies have continued to not only allow this but essentially encourage it, because they make matching contributions with their own stock as a way to conserve cash,\u201d he said. (GE employees are not required to take matching contributions in company stock, a GE spokeswoman said.) Pozen has no problem with employee stock ownership outside a retirement plan, or stock options. But most employees should hold broadly diversified retirement portfolios, he said. Morningstar research has found that the stock of companies with high allocations of their own stock in a 401(k) plan tended to underperform their peers on a relative performance and risk-adjusted basis. Moreover, Vanguard research shows that concentrated stock positions tend to displace investments in diversified equity funds and other balanced funds. Overall equity allocations also tend to be higher. Another problem is exposing workers to the double risk of potentially losing not only their savings but their jobs. And the GE story underscores the false sense of comfort that can arise among employee investors. \"Companies like GE have done very well over many decades, but there are very few that do really well over 30 or 40 years,\" Pozen said. I asked GE if it has policies or programs in place encouraging diversification. Mary Kate Nevin, manager of financial and executive communications, pointed to language in an employee benefits handbook warning against the risk of having any more than 20 percent of retirement savings in any single company stock, or industry. She also noted that the 401(k) program held more than 250 education sessions with workers last year that also included messages about the importance of diversification. Pozen thinks more will be required. He argues U.S. Congress should take steps to reduce or eliminate this risk by limiting holdings of employer stock to 10 percent of plan assets - the same legal limit that defined benefit plans must follow in their investment portfolios. \u201cYou could grandfather existing programs, and tell them that they can no longer increase the percentage of their own stock in the plan,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a dramatic thing, and it would be very positive for plan participants.\u201d (Editing by Matthew Lewis)","68":"NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - General Electric Co, a major buyer of Chinese goods, estimates new tariffs on its imports from China could raise its costs by $300 million to $400 million overall before steps to lessen the impact, Chief Executive John Flannery said on Friday.  In comment on the tariffs set up by President Donald Trump, Flannery said GE imports about $2.9 billion worth of goods annually from China, roughly 10 percent of total its imports. The cost of the tariffs \u201ccould be $300 to $400 million at a gross level before any mitigating factors,\u201d he said.","69":"(Repeats to widen distribution)  NEW YORK, March 4 (Reuters) - General Electric Co is setting aside one of the largest amounts ever to cover potential losses on policies that provide long-term care in nursing facilities and patients\u2019 homes. But insurance experts are concerned that may not be enough.  GE shocked investors last year when it took a $6.2 billion after-tax charge and said it planned to set aside $15 billion over seven years to cover claims on some 300,000 long-term care policies written more than a decade ago, when actuaries did not yet know how costly the claims would become.  The costs, which far exceeded GE\u2019s estimates, sent its shares tumbling, spurred an investor lawsuit and prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate.  Last week, GE provided new details about its insurance and scheduled a \u201cteach in\u201d for Thursday to give more information.  GE\u2019s new reserves amount to about $55,000 per policy, in line with those of other long-term care insurers, according to an analysis for Reuters by Audit Analytics, an independent research company based in Massachusetts.  For comparison, Humana Inc has set aside $77,282 per policy, while Unum Group has set aside $10,614, Audit Analytics said.  For a graphic, click: tmsnrt.rs\/2EEXWt1  Those amounts are less than the cost of one year\u2019s stay in a private nursing-home room, which averages $92,376 in the United States, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said.  GE has since cut $500 million from the $15 billion in reserves it plans to make for the policies through 2024. Its latest loss recognition test required only a $65 million after-tax charge, a sign, it said, that its estimates are on track.  But GE\u2019s disclosures and reserves have not eliminated fears that insurance could bring more pain to GE and its investors.  \u201cI think it is impossible to know whether the $15 billion is enough,\u201d Joseph Belth, professor emeritus of insurance at Indiana University, who has written extensively about long-term care policies, told Reuters after reviewing GE\u2019s disclosures.  Long-term care coverage, which typically pays for in-home, assisted living or skilled nursing care, has required many insurers to boost reserves in recent years. In one rare case, regulators in 2017 placed Penn Treaty American Corp, a U.S. insurer that wrote such policies, in liquidation due to losses.  Unlike, say, fire insurance on a home, which is unlikely to pay out, most long-term care policies do pay claims eventually. Policies can be imprecise about what is covered, leaving room for legal battles that make costs hard for insurers to estimate, experts said. And policyholders or family members usually decide when and where to seek care, which made it tricky for insurers in the early days to set premiums that cover costs over time.  \u201cA VERY RISKY PRODUCT\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to put your arms around the risk,\u201d said Bruno Caron, a credit analyst at A.M. Best, a New Jersey-based credit rating agency that specializes in insurance companies.  Increasing reserves generally reduces the risk of future losses, but \u201csometimes reserves signal a deficiency in a block of policies that reoccurs in the same block,\u201d Caron said. \u201cWe view long-term care insurance as a very risky product.\u201d  GE said it set reserves based on assumptions that reflect its \u201cemerging experience\u201d with long-term care policies.  Several analysts said GE is being overly optimistic. GE would need another $12 billion in reserves if it stopped assuming that generally better health means fewer people will seek care, known as \u201cmorbidity improvement,\u201d and changed other favorable assumptions as some rivals have, said John Inch, an analyst at Gordon Haskett Research Advisors.  Others noted GE lost out on premium increases that rivals got by moving quickly when long-term care costs became apparent.  \u201cThey (GE) were very slow in reacting to emerging experience relative to peers,\u201d said Douglas Meyer, a long-term care insurance specialist and managing director at Fitch Ratings. Now GE has \u201csignificantly less repricing flexibility\u201d because it cannot make up for past premium increases others received.  Two GE subsidiaries hold its long-term care insurance: Employers Reassurance Corp and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Co. Both are reinsurers, which means GE must pay out on policies that others wrote and is prevented from seeking premium rate increases directly from state insurance commissions, experts said. It is unclear how many companies that wrote the coverage have sought increase for policies in GE\u2019s portfolio, they added.  GE said that it is working with insurers to obtain increases. Its reserve calculation anticipates about $1.7 billion in premium increases or benefit reductions, but those include increases that are not yet approved by regulators and requests for increases that have not yet been filed.","70":"(Reuters) - General Electric Co GE.N posted quarterly results that topped expectations on Friday, as earnings from aviation, healthcare and transportation offset weak power and oil-and-gas profits, sending shares sharply higher.  FILE PHOTO: A pedestrian walks past a General Electric (GE) facility in Medford, Massachusetts, U.S., April 20, 2017. REUTERS\/Brian Snyder\/File Photo  GE affirmed its forecast for 2018 earnings and cash flow, and said it expects to book as much as $10 billion in proceeds from divesting industrial assets this year. Those comments eased concern that GE would post poor results.  GE\u2019s profit reflected 7-percent revenue growth and vigorous cost cutting. Revenue rose in aviation, oil-and-gas and healthcare, offsetting declines in power, transportation, lighting and renewable energy. GE sliced $1 billion in costs, including $800 million in industrial structural costs.  GE\u2019s shares were up 3.8 percent to $14.52 on Thursday. The stock has lost more than half its value in the past last year.  But GE also took a $1.5-billion reserve charge for potential costs associated with its discontinued WMC mortgage business, formerly part GE Capital.  The U.S. Department of Justice has been investigating the activities of GE\u2019s former mortgage unit during the subprime mortgage crisis, since 2015. GE said settlement discussions with the DOJ in March and analysis of other banks\u2019 reserves prompted it to take the charge, but it sees limited impact to results.  \u201cWe do not expect this to change our view on GE Capital with regards to cash and liquidity,\u201d GE Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller said on a conference call with analysts.  Excluding adjustments, GE earned $369 million, or 4 cents a share, on revenue of $28.7 billion. That compared with 1 cent a share a year ago.  While several analysts thought GE handily beat forecasts, others cited the unadjusted earnings as being more telling.  \u201cI\u2019m looking at it as coming in as expected,\u201d analyst Jeff Windau at Edward Jones, said of the results and the adjustments. \u201cAnd expectations were low.\u201d  JPMorgan analyst Steve Tusa was among those who said GE may cut its full-year earnings forecast in coming months. While results were \u201cnot that bad\u201d compared with other quarters, Tusa said, negative free cash flow of $1.68 billion was weaker than he expected. GE typically reports negative cash flow early in the year as it spends on inventory shipped later in the year.  GE earned an adjusted 16 cents per share, up from a restated 14 cents a share a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected 11 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S. GE recently restated 2017 results to reflect changes in accounting standards.  Analysts had forecast GE\u2019s profit to decline in the first quarter and some thought Friday\u2019s results might fail to meet even those diminished expectations.  But the company\u2019s aviation, transportation and healthcare businesses produced double-digit profit growth in the quarter, boosting overall results.  Profit at GE\u2019s power business fell 38 percent on a 9 percent decline in sales; orders dropped 29 percent.  \u201cThe industry continues to be challenging and is trending softer than our forecast,\u201d GE said of the power business.  Profit in GE\u2019s oil and gas unit fell 30 percent, excluding restructuring and other charges, GE said.","71":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - General Electric Co reinforced its defense of its accounting practices on Monday after investors asked more questions about an unusual research report last week that accused the jet engine and power plant maker of financial fraud.  FILE PHOTO: The General Electric Co. logo is seen on the company's corporate headquarters building in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. July 23, 2019. REUTERS\/Alwyn Scott\/File Photo  The 175-page report www.gefraud.com, published on Thursday by Harry Markopolos, who blew the whistle on Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme, renewed concern about GE's finances and sent its stock tumbling.  \u201cSome of (the) questions I\u2019ve been receiving go straight to the heart of GE\u2019s culture, so let me be clear: we operate with absolute integrity and stand behind our financial reporting,\u201d Steve Winoker, GE\u2019s investor relations chief, said in a statement on Monday.  Investors are nervous about GE because the Boston-based conglomerate is expected to lose as much as $1 billion in cash this year, has slashed its dividend and profit forecast and taken more than $40 billion in charges and write-offs in recent years.  Among the biggest shocks to investors, GE said in 2017 that it would set aside $15 billion for long-term care insurance payouts, one of the largest such amounts ever.  GRAPHIC: GE's Long-Term Plan -  Markopolos said GE would need to put aside an additional $29 billion for insurance losses, and that it had improperly counted profit from oil and gas services subsidiary Baker Hughes.  A Reuters article in March found that GE\u2019s reserves were then in line with other insurers, but some experts said GE would need to set aside $12 billion more because its estimates relied on optimistic assumptions.  GE\u2019s shares fell as much as 15% after Markopolos\u2019 report came out, recouping much of the decline on Friday. On Monday, GE shares were down 1.4% at $8.67 in afternoon trading.  In response to the concerns about insurance, Winoker said on Monday that the amount of GE\u2019s long-term care payouts would be determined \u201cover decades, not years,\u201d and that GE uses \u201crigorous testing,\u201d \u201csound actuarial analysis\u201d and follows \u201cregulatory and accounting\u201d rules.  Addressing the Baker Hughes questions, Winoker said accounting rules require GE to include the subsidiary\u2019s results in its earnings reports because it is the majority shareholder.  GE disclosed in 2018 that its accounting was being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. It also is the subject of a class-action shareholder lawsuit that alleges fraud in GE\u2019s insurance and other accounting.  Winoker, who covered GE as an analyst at UBS before taking his current job in January, said investors\u2019 questions about Markopolos\u2019 report prompted GE to comment on Monday, but did not say how many questions GE received or characterize them.  SHORT PROFITS  Markopolos said in the report that he stood to share in profits from a hedge fund that sold GE shares short before the report came out, a bet that the share price would fall.  Short sales of GE shares rose by about $995 million in the month before Markopolos\u2019 report came out, according to S3 Partners, a New York financial analytics firm.  GE Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp said last week that Markopolos\u2019 report was \u201cmarket manipulation - pure and simple\u201d - a reference to Markopolos\u2019 potential to profit from short-selling timed to the report.  Culp and Leslie Seidman, chair of GE\u2019s audit committee, said Markopolos did not talk with GE before issuing his report. GE said Culp, Seidman and other GE directors and executives bought shares after the report came out.  GE said in the statement on Monday that it has not under-provisioned for long-term care insurance, which pays for assisted living and nursing home care for policy holders. Such policies have pushed some insurers into financial trouble, and even bankruptcy, because the costs have turned out to be much higher than were assumed when the policies were written in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  GE is now only a reinsurer of such coverage and says it has not written new long-term care policies since 2006.  Markopolos\u2019 report said GE needs to add $18.5 billion to reserves now because it has underestimated its potential claims, and will need to add a further $10.5 billion when new accounting rules take effect in 2021 or 2022.  Regarding Baker Hughes, GE said on Monday that the company\u2019s assets and income are correctly included in GE\u2019s financial reports because GE owns 50.2%, down from 50.4% last year.  Markopolos said GE is double-counting because it does not in practice direct activities at Baker Hughes.","72":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - General Electric Co on Tuesday offered an upbeat outlook for its business this year after reporting a surge in quarterly free cash flow, showing Chief Executive Larry Culp\u2019s turnaround plan is gaining traction.  The performance came largely on the back of improved operational management and recovery in the company\u2019s power and renewable businesses.  Since taking over the company\u2019s reins in 2018, Culp has been focusing on lean-manufacturing practices aimed at eliminating waste and continuous improvement. It has helped drive cash savings and rendered GE\u2019s businesses more profitable.  For example, its gas power division, which competes with Mitsubishi and Siemens, stopped burning cash a year earlier than GE previously indicated. Its non-gas power business reported the first profit growth this quarter in two years.  GE\u2019s power division reported a double-digit growth in equipment orders despite the company\u2019s decision to exit the coal-fired power plants business.  Meanwhile, equipment orders for renewable energy grew for the first time since the third quarter of 2019, driven by large onshore wind orders in North America and offshore wind orders from the Dogger bank wind farm in the United Kingdom.  Culp has described GE\u2019s turnaround as \u201ca game of inches.\u201d In a phone interview, he said the company still has a lot to do.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of U.S. conglomerate General Electric is pictured at the site of the company's energy branch in Belfort, France, February 5, 2019. REUTERS\/Vincent Kessler\/File Photo GLOBAL BUSINESS WEEK AHEAD  He said the company\u2019s 2021 outlook was \u201cachievable\u201d on the back of a \u201cstrong\u201d performance in healthcare and \u201ccontinued progress\u201d in its power and renewable businesses.  \u201cThose three businesses, for the most part, have found a level of stability and relative predictability amid the pandemic,\u201d he told Reuters.  GE\u2019s shares have gained over 60% since late October on hopes that the worst is over for the company as a recovery in air travel would boost its aviation business, usually its most profitable and most cash-generative segment. Its shares were last trading up 5.2% at $11.57.  The company, however, expects aviation revenue to be flat to up this year with air traffic forecast to recover in the second half.  Culp said while the return of Boeing Co\u2019s 737 MAX jets - which use GE\u2019s engines - is a \u201cpositive\u201d for the conglomerate, it will not change the trajectory of its aviation business in the near-term.  In response to the pandemic-induced business turmoil, GE cut costs by more than $2 billion and took other steps to save $3 billion in cash last year, resulting in thousands of layoffs at its aviation unit.  Culp said the unit will likely see a \u201clittle bit\u201d of more cost cuts this year. Those details, however, are still being worked out, he said.  The Boston-based industrial conglomerate predicted free cash flow of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion this year after generating cash flow of $4.4 billion in the fourth quarter.  Free-cash flow is closely watched by investors as a sign of the health of GE\u2019s operations and ability to pay down debt.  Overall, the company expects an improvement in its industrial business this year, forecasting a low-single-digit growth in revenue.","73":"The General Electric Co. logo is seen on the company's corporate headquarters building in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. July 23, 2019.

The bank\u2019s Stephen Tusa, among the bearish group of analysts on GE who have predicted its fall from grace over the last three years, said he was withdrawing his price guidance on the company completely due to doubts over how much it was now worth.  GE shares fell about 1% to $6.54 in premarket trade, adding to a steep decline that has seen the company lose more than 40% of its market value this year.  Tusa said the company\u2019s inability to forecast positive cashflow for the second half of 2020 suggested management is unclear about its financial outlook over the next 3-6 months and that hopes of better results next year may prove illusory.  \u201cThere is apparently enough visibility to not only call positive 2021 free cashflow but also a long term FCF target, all keeping a persistently optimistic Street from resetting,\u201d Tusa wrote.  \u201cThe collapse of this forward estimate curve is coming soon.\u201d  Some 12 of 20 other Wall Street analysts who cover GE currently recommend buying its shares. Most of those also expect GE to be free cash flow positive in the second half.  Tusa, a long-time bear on GE, said structural concerns in the struggling U.S. industrial conglomerate\u2019s aviation and power businesses are preventing a turnaround.","74":"KRASNOYARSK, Russia (Reuters) - The chief executive of Russia\u2019s Inter RAO said on Saturday the energy holding hoped to reach a deal with General Electric Co by October to produce powerful gas turbines in Russia, either as a joint venture or by buying a license from GE.

It is seen as a rare opportunity for Western producers amid falling global demand for gas turbines in recent years, but Moscow has said investors must only use fully localised -- domestically produced -- equipment as part of a local content push.  Inter RAO CEO Boris Kovalchuk said the modernization program would open a large market for GE for 10 years.  \u201cWe hope to reach all the agreements with them within half a year,\u201d Kovalchuk told reporters during a conference in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk.  A plant jointly owned by Inter RAO, GE and Russian state conglomerate Rostec produces 77-megawatt turbines in Russia\u2019s central region of Yaroslavl.

Siemens, which owns a 65-percent stake in the venture, has pledged to raise the level of localization in the production process.  Russian state-controlled firms -- Rostec, Rosnano and Inter RAO -- have been trying to create their own gas turbine production but their prototype project failed testing, sources, familiar with the matter, told Reuters a year ago.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of General Electric is seen at its plant in Baden, Switzerland November 15, 2017. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  The move comes after GE announced in January it would take a $6.2 billion after-tax charge and set aside a further $15 billion in reserves to help cover liabilities in insurance operations held by its GE Capital unit, mainly concerning long-term care (LTC) policies.  Many providers of LTC insurance, including GE, underestimated the cost of servicing policies, meaning premiums have been unable to cover the spiraling costs of healthcare and longer life expectancy.  While GE\u2019s insurance operations have stopped generating new business, existing contracts managed to maturity in a process known as run-off have become a major financial burden for the U.S industrial conglomerate.  GE is hoping investment firms which specialize in acquiring run-off insurance businesses could buy some of the assets, the sources said. While GE is focused on shedding its troubled LTC business, it is open to divesting other insurance assets, including structured settlements and other life and disability products, the sources added.  The sources, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential, cautioned that no deal is certain given the liabilities that GE faces in its insurance business. A GE spokeswoman declined to comment.  GE spun out much of its insurance business in 2004 into Genworth Financial GNW.N, itself currently attempting a sale to China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co for $2.7 billion. That deal has been held up by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a U.S. national security panel.  GE said in January a review of its remaining insurance portfolio showed 300,000 policies needed $15 billion more in reserves to cover potential payouts, or about $50,000 per policy, on top of the charge it took as part of its fourth-quarter earnings. It subsequently disclosed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had begun probing how it handled its insurance obligations.  Insurance liabilities stood at $38 billion at the end of 2017, according to GE\u2019s annual report.  GE has also been sued by shareholders accusing it of concealing mounting insurance liabilities and the SEC probe, arguing this cost investors tens of billions of dollars.  Struggling to maintain profitability and facing calls to be broken up, GE has proposed major cost-cutting and selling or spinning off parts of its business including power, aviation and healthcare as a way to bolster its value.  As part of its drive to shed assets, GE announced an $11.1 billion deal on Monday to merge its transportation business with U.S. rail equipment manufacturer Wabtec Corp WAB.N, with GE and its shareholders owning just over half of the combined business.

While details have not been finalised, GE\u2019s plan calls for cutting up to 1,044 positions, mainly at its Belfort site, which employs 4,300 people.  GE said the plan would potentially cut 792 out of 1,900 jobs at the gas power unit, and possibly 252 other support positions.  The remaining reductions also would occur mainly at Belfort, which handles gas, steam, nuclear and hydro technology, GE said.

However, the company had to break that commitment as the gas turbine power plant market collapsed.  In the end, GE created just 25 jobs, and in February agreed to pay 50 million euros ($56 million) into a reindustrialization fund for falling short of the target.

While negative sentiment caused by the elimination of the company from the Dow could lead to more selling of its shares on Wednesday, investors predicted that GE\u2019s removal would prompt little reaction from major investment funds.  \u201cSymbolically, this indignity marks GE\u2019s fall from grace,\u201d said analysts at RBC. \u201cHowever, given that the DJIA is a price-weighted index, GE now represents less than one-half of a percent of the overall index with its current stock price sitting below $13.\u201d  GE is now the sixth smallest member of the Dow by market value, and it sports the index\u2019s lowest stock price, making it the least influential component of the price-weighted average.  About $20 billion is invested in exchange traded funds tied to the Dow, the vast majority in the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust DIA.P, according to Lipper data.  By comparison, ETFs that track the S&P 500 have assets of around $380 billion. That means GE\u2019s exit from the Dow next week will trigger a relatively small amount of selling by passively managed funds reconfiguring their holdings.  Underscoring the greater heft of the S&P 500, Twitter Inc TWTR.N surged 5 percent to a record high on June 5 after it was announced that the social media network would join that index.  The largest U.S. corporation by stock market value during most of the 1990s and until it was overtaken by Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N in 2005, GE's market capitalization now stands at $118 billion, less than 15 percent of Apple Inc's AAPL.O size.  GE is now tied with 3M Co MMM.N as the Dow components that are least favored by stock analysts, according to Thomson Reuters data. Following GE's recent warning that it might not be able to pay its 2019 dividend, just five analysts recommend buying shares in GE, compared with three who recommend selling and eight with neutral ratings.","93":"(Reuters) - General Electric said on Tuesday it has received a notice from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission staff, warning that the company could face a civil action for possible violations of securities laws related to accounting practices for some of its insurance holdings.  FILE PHOTO: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission logo adorns an office door at the SEC headquarters in Washington, June 24, 2011. REUTERS\/Jonathan Ernst\/  In a regulatory filing, the U.S. industrial conglomerate said the issues the regulator could pursue relate to the company\u2019s run-off insurance operations - a portfolio of about 300,000 long-term care insurance policies it holds in its GE Capital unit.  In 2017, GE took a surprise accounting charge of $6.2 billion and said it would need to set aside $15 billion for long-term care insurance payouts, one of the largest such amounts ever.  Securities regulators opened a probe into the company\u2019s accounting practices after the massive insurance charge. The inquiry, which initially focused on long-term service agreements for maintenance of power plants, jet engines and other industrial equipment, was later expanded to include GE\u2019s review of its insurance business.  Tuesday\u2019s notice marks the first public indication that the SEC staff is considering recommending a regulatory action.  GE, however, said the Wells notice is neither a formal allegation nor a finding of wrongdoing. A Wells notice is a letter sent by the SEC to people or companies when it plans to bring an enforcement action against them.  \u201cGE has fully cooperated with the SEC\u2019s investigation related to past reserve practices at our run-off insurance subsidiary, as we have disclosed since 2018,\u201d a company representative said. \u201cWe strongly disagree with the recommendation of the SEC staff and will provide a response through the Wells notice process.\u201d  GE shares were down 3.9% late on Tuesday afternoon.  Most of GE\u2019s insurance operations were spun off in Genworth Financial Inc more than a decade ago, but it retained some of the legacy long-term care policies and also reinsures policies written by other insurers.  GE has said the SEC is also investigating revenue recognition accounting at the company\u2019s power business, which led to a $22 billion goodwill write-off in 2018.","94":"March 12 (Reuters) - General Electric Co:  * GENERAL ELECTRIC CO SAYS FORMER CHAIRMAN AND CEO JEFF IMMELT\u2019S SEC TOTAL COMPENSATION WAS $8.1 MILLION - SEC FILING  * GE SAYS CHAIRMAN & CEO JOHN FLANNERY\u2019S SEC TOTAL COMPENSATION FOR 2017 WAS $9 MILLION - SEC FILING  * GENERAL ELECTRIC SAYS CFO, JAMIE MILLER\u2019S FY 2017 SEC TOTAL COMPENSATION WAS $5.1 MILLION - SEC FILING  * GENERAL ELECTRIC CO - FORMER VICE CHAIR & CFO JEFF BORNSTEIN'S FY 2017 SEC TOTAL COMPENSATION WAS $14.6 MILLION Source text (bit.ly\/2p5uR1p) Further company coverage: (Reuters.Brief@thomsonreuters.com)","95":"FILE PHOTO: The General Electric Co. logo is seen on the company's corporate headquarters building in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. July 23, 2019.

Despite flat demand for new natural gas power plants, they said, GE Power\u2019s revenue and profit would rise.  Showing data from financial firm Lazard and other sources, their presentation said natural gas, coal and even some nuclear power plants were the lowest-cost producers of electricity on the planet, cheaper than wind or solar.  \u201cGas is the most economical energy source today,\u201d one slide read. In the days following the conference, GE\u2019s shares rose 2 percent.  But GE\u2019s forecast turned out to be a mirage.  Rather than rising, GE Power\u2019s profit fell 45 percent last year, forcing GE to slash its overall profit outlook and cut its dividend for only the second time since the Great Depression. Its shares have plunged more than 50 percent since the March forecast. Former CEO Jeff Immelt was replaced in August.  John Flannery, GE\u2019s new chief executive, blamed the forecast, along with poor management and other factors, for the power business meltdown. In January, he warned the pain would continue this year \u201cand potentially be worse than expected.\u201d  What GE has not emphasized is that wind and solar now cost substantially less than gas and other conventional energy sources - and have for years, according to a widely respected energy cost report Lazard has published since 2008.  For graphic showing energy costs and other details, click: tmsnrt.rs\/2Fge6ra  GE said Lazard was one data source for its March forecast, which also weighed the high efficiency of GE\u2019s latest gas power plants and other factors. GE said cost \u201cis not the only predictor\u201d of the power source utilities will choose. They may also value the reliability of fossil fuels over wind and solar.  \u201cWe have a rigorous financial planning process,\u201d GE said in response to questions from Reuters.  But according to more than a dozen former executives, rivals and energy experts interviewed by Reuters, GE\u2019s reading of the market left the company deeply vulnerable to the sudden drop in demand for conventional power plants, as sales of wind and solar surged.  \u201cThere are just fewer gas turbines being bought,\u201d one former GE executive said. \u201cThe market is not flat, it\u2019s down.\u201d  Power is not GE\u2019s only problem. Its financing arm, GE Capital, took a massive, unexpected charge that contributed to a nearly $10 billion loss in the fourth quarter and prompted U.S. regulators to broaden an ongoing probe of its accounting practices. Profit also fell sharply at GE\u2019s separate oil and gas and locomotive businesses last year, and Flannery has suggested he may break up the company.  But power is one of GE\u2019s oldest and largest businesses, and supplied 60 percent of the conglomerate\u2019s profit as recently as 2016. Now, GE is cutting 12,000 jobs, 18 percent of the unit\u2019s workforce, after announcing 6,500 job cuts in early 2016.  On Wednesday, GE Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller warned of \u201ca little bit more noise\u201d at GE Power, calling 2018 \u201ca reset and stabilization year\u201d for the division.  She declined to predict when GE Power would regain double-digit profit margins it had in 2016, and said turning it around \u201cwill take a good 12 to 18 months.\u201d  DOUBLING DOWN  GE doubled down on fossil fuel in 2015 with the $10.3 billion purchase of French group Alstom\u2019s power business. The deal expanded GE\u2019s exposure to gas, coal and nuclear power just as solar costs fell below those of gas-powered plants, according to Lazard.  The Alstom deal added 65,000 employees to GE\u2019s payroll and dozens of factories and service centers around the globe at a time when GE was trying to cut costs.  Orders for GE\u2019s newest, large gas-fired turbines have fallen 35 percent in the two years since the deal closed, and industry estimates show demand for conventional plants is unlikely to hit 2017 levels again for at least a decade.  The cost gap between renewable and conventional power is still widening, and some utilities already are mothballing older fossil plants, using them only to supplement wind and solar.  Other companies also were hit by the decline in sales. But competitors Siemens AG and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems were cautious. Paul Browning, Chief Executive of MHPS North America, said his company watched wind and solar power costs fall 12 percent a year for more than a decade.  \u201cWe did see a lot of this coming and didn\u2019t make acquisitions or build up a lot of facilities, people or inventory,\u201d Browning said in an interview.  While Alstom gave GE more than $14 billion more in annual revenue, Alstom\u2019s profit margins were less than one-third of GE\u2019s. Immelt saw that as an opportunity.  \u201cIf we thought this was a 6 percent margin business that we couldn\u2019t dramatically improve, we are not going to do it,\u201d Immelt said of the Alstom purchase in May 2014. \u201cWe are basically in similar businesses in the same market, and we run our business at a 20 percent margin.\u201d  But regulators required GE to sell the power-plant service arm of Alstom, a Florida-based company called Power Systems Manufacturing that had long been a competitor to GE, Mitsubishi and Siemens.  GE, which had counted on that business serving a large base of plants around the world to make Alstom more profitable, bid aggressively on service deals to avoid losing them to competitors, according to three people familiar with the bidding.  That has raised concerns among investors that it is locked into service contracts that will not be profitable.  Rather than improving Alstom\u2019s margins, GE Power\u2019s margin plunged to 7.7 percent last year from 21 percent before the acquisition.  In response to questions from Reuters, GE said lucrative income from fixing downed power plants fell by half last year, a major hit to profits.  But it defended the Alstom purchase, which instantly gave it 50 percent more plants to service, something that would take half a century to build up from scratch. Since it is a long-term business, GE said, and \u201cwe have opportunity to improve the performance in the future.\u201d  LIGHTING UP THE WORLD... FOR NOW  GE\u2019s power plants generate one-third of the world\u2019s electricity, giving it a large installed base for services revenue.  But industry experts point out that GE\u2019s gas power plants are mainly older F-Class units, rather than the new, larger H-Class turbines. Older gas-fired plants often cannot compete with wind and solar, especially when governments provide subsidies, said Stuart Slade, director of consulting at market research firm Forecast International.  \u201cThere are a lot of single-cycle gas plants being mothballed,\u201d Slade said.  Alstom inflicted other blows: New Alstom orders fell off in the 18 months before the deal closed as customers held back on purchases. That gave competitors scope to gain market share, according to people familiar with the sales competitions.  GE has sold the largest number F-Class power plants. But it is in third place behind Mitsubishi and Siemens in competition for the newest, largest and most fuel-efficient advance class turbines, according to McCoy Power Reports, an industry research company.  Orders for all of GE Power\u2019s plants and services have fallen 13 percent since 2016, a decline that accelerated at the end of last year. GE also wrote off some of the equipment it built up as part of an $850 million charge it took in the fourth quarter. GE did not rule out further write offs, in response to questions from Reuters.  Miller and GE Power Chief Executive Russell Stokes have said the problems are fixable, and the company acknowledged in a recent strategy paper that wind and solar are a fast-growing part of the world\u2019s energy supply.  Still, GE downplays the threat to its bulked up fossil fuel product line. Despite rapid growth of wind and solar, it says, two-thirds of power generation will come from gas, coal and nuclear plants over the next decade.  \u201cThe transformation will not happen overnight,\u201d GE said in the strategy paper.","102":"The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said on Wednesday that it would not revive a shareholder lawsuit accusing General Electric of hiding a serious defect in its flagship gas turbine in 2018.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of U.S. conglomerate General Electric is pictured at the company's site of its energy branch in Belfort, France, February 5, 2019. REUTERS\/Vincent Kessler\/File Photo  The settlement between GE and a trustee for two bankrupt Florida investment funds known as Palm Beach Finance, who was seeking $651 million, was filed with the federal bankruptcy court in West Palm Beach, Florida. Court approval is required.  GE denied liability in agreeing to settle claims related to its General Electric Capital unit, one of Petters\u2019 lenders. A spokeswoman, Jennifer Erickson, declined to comment.  The accord removes a financial overhang for Boston-based GE, which is trying to cut costs while projecting lower 2019 cash flow and profitability from its core industrial operations.  Petters, 61, was convicted in December 2009 on 20 counts including fraud and money laundering, over what prosecutors called a $3.65 billion fraud.  Prosecutors said Petters bilked investors who thought he was using their money to buy consumer electronics from wholesalers and resell them to big-box retailers such as Costco Wholesale Corp and Walmart Inc\u2019s Sam\u2019s Club.  Federal authorities raided Petters\u2019 offices in September 2008 and criminally charged him that December, the same month Bernard Madoff was charged over his own Ponzi scheme.  Barry Mukamal, the trustee for the Palm Beach Finance funds, said GE Capital knew as early as 2000 about Petters\u2019 fraud, but kept quiet to ensure Petters would keep paying its fees.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Paul Hyman in June 2017 refused to dismiss the lawsuit, which accused GE Capital of conspiring to commit fraud.  GE had argued that only the trustee overseeing Petters\u2019 bankrupt companies could bring the conspiracy claim.  Hyman had previously dismissed eight other claims in the September 2012 lawsuit. The Palm Beach Finance funds filed for bankruptcy in November 2009.  Michael Budwick, a lawyer for Mukamal, said the failure of three of Petters\u2019 other lenders to recover anything from GE on similar \u201ccopycat\u201d claims was a factor in deciding to settle, along with the death of a key witness.  \u201cVictims of Ponzi schemes should realize they can be successful pursuing recoveries against companies they consider financially responsible,\u201d Budwick, a partner at Meland Russin & Budwick, said in an interview.  Mukamal in 2015 reached a separate $16 million settlement with Bank of Montreal, whose Milwaukee-based unit Marshall & Ilsley also worked with Petters.

The sector is racing to build ever larger turbines, which are becoming more efficient along with size. The most powerful offshore turbines currently in commercial use were built by MHI Vestas and have an output of 8.8 MW.  Rivals Senvion and Siemens Gamesa are both looking into double-digit MW offshore turbines for the next decade. Earlier this year, GE announced its 12 MW Haliade-X, to be launched in 2021, the biggest turbine to date.  Graphic - Giant wind turbines: tmsnrt.rs\/2rr299K  \u201cWe believe that we can occupy the space of the competition with the current platform and the current incremental design that we are considering,\u201d MHI Vestas Chief Executive Philippe Kavafyan told Reuters.  \u201cFor us, the next step is beyond what is currently announced.\u201d  MHI Vestas is owned in equal shares by Japanese engineering group Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Denmark\u2019s Vestas, the world\u2019s second-largest maker of wind turbines after Siemens Gamesa.  Kavafyan said that scaling up would be possible by adding larger rotors, reinforcing the torque and upgrading electrical systems, which would spare the group developing an expensive new machine.  The company has been able to produce a ramped up V164 platform with an output of 9.5 MW, which it will install for the first time next year, when Siemens Gamesa will bring its 8 MW turbine to the market.  \u201cThat gives us a roughly 1.5 MW advantage which translates directly into infrastructure savings. That\u2019s easily 15-20 percent,\u201d Kavafyan said.  Infrastructure costs such as building foundations or laying cables usually account for a third of the total cost of an offshore wind farm, which start from 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion). Turbines make up about 40 percent.  Offshore wind project developers such as Innogy and Orsted depend on falling costs as the industry is weaning off subsidies and must compete in public tenders for capacity where the lowest bids succeed.  \u201cThe biggest decision drivers are size and efficiency, cost and maintenance,\u201d according to Oskar Tijs, senior investment analyst at Dutch asset manager NN Investment Partners, one of Siemens Gamesa\u2019s top-10 shareholders.  \u201cIf GE gets its 12 MW turbine on the market, MHI Vestas and Siemens Gamesa would have to act.\u201d  ($1 = 0.8499 euros)","116":"(Adds Smith quote in paragraph 6)  SEATTLE, June 5 (Reuters) - Boeing Co\u2019s effort to build the world\u2019s largest twin-engined jet, the 777X, continues to be hampered by challenges with General Electric Co\u2019s new GE9X turbine engine, a top Boeing executive said on Wednesday.  Boeing is facing testing glitches on the GE9X after assembly delays on the engine and the plane\u2019s carbon-composite wings. These issues, coupled with the crisis over its 737 MAX in the wake of deadly crashes, leaves the world\u2019s largest planemaker less leeway to deliver on its official 2020 target for entry into service, industry sources say.  Dubai\u2019s Emirates has said it expects to fly its first 777X in June 2020, a date now widely seen in doubt.  Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told a conference that 2020 entry into service was \u201cstill the current assumption,\u201d echoing comments from Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg last week.  \u201c(The) long pole in the tent right now is the GE engine,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThere\u2019s some challenges they are working through there on testing. So we are having to do some re-testing, and they\u2019re working their way through that.\u201d  \u201cAs we see it today, we still expect to fly this year and enter into service in 2020,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut obviously, we\u2019re staying very close to that and we\u2019ll keep you updated if that changes. But that\u2019s still the current assumption.\u201d  The market for widebody jets has been fragile due to oversupply and fears over the economy and trade disputes. Reuters reported in March that a major potential deal for more than 100 Boeing jetliners of various types with China was in doubt in the wake of the trade dispute and the MAX crisis.  The first two 777X flight test aircraft have left Boeing\u2019s Seattle-area factory and are in integrated system testing on the ground, while the next two flight test airplanes are in final assembly, Muilenburg said.  But the engine snags and other issues have diminished the prospect of a maiden flight in late June, despite a prediction over the weekend by the head of Gulf airline Emirates for a \u202aJune 26 flight.  One airline source familiar with the program said the flight test schedule had originally been set at 14 months, but heightened scrutiny over aircraft certification after two 737 MAX crashes in October and March means that schedule is unlikely to be accelerated.  That means the 777X is more likely to be handed over to airlines toward the end of 2020, and that date could slip into 2021, airline sources said at an industry gathering in Seoul this week.  GE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  GE began flight trials of the turbine engine, the world\u2019s largest, in March after a three-month delay caused mainly by a problem in its compressor. (Reporting by Eric M.

The longer reviews, which are held quarterly, are among the cultural changes under Larry Culp, who became CEO in October, Miller said at an conference organized by Deutsche Bank. (Reporting by Alwyn Scott Editing by Bill Trott)","118":"Feb 25 (Reuters) - General Electric Co bonds rallied broadly on Monday after the company struck a deal to sell its biopharma business to Danaher Corp for $21.4 billion and said it would use cash from the deal to ease its massive debt burden.  Yields on GE bonds, which move in the opposite direction of their price, fell to the lowest in about four months across dozens of debt securities and the risk premium demanded by investors in exchange for holding GE paper declined. The price to insure its bonds against default also sank, registering their largest one-day drop in at least three years, according to data from IHS Markit.  The price increase on GE\u2019s roughly $120 billion of bonds was the latest leg in a recovery so far this year after they took a pounding in late 2018 when its new chief executive, Larry Culp, said earlier restructuring efforts were falling short and that the company would need to take more-aggressive action to address its debt load in particular.  Culp slashed GE\u2019s quarterly dividend to just a penny a share and has since struck a raft of deals to sell assets. The bulk of proceeds have been pledged toward working down its debt, which at one point in late 2018 was roughly twice GE\u2019s market capitalization as its stock price plunged to a low of $6.66 a share in December.  The three main credit rating agencies - Moody\u2019s Investors Service, S&P Global Markets and Fitch Ratings - peg GE debt at just three notches above junk bond levels. For much of the fourth quarter of 2018, its bonds were trading as though they were no longer investment-grade securities.  GE bonds\u2019 broad underperformance last year, when they skidded by around 14 percent, weighed heavily on the U.S. corporate bond market overall. Bonds rated on a par with GE\u2019s in the so-called triple-B range now account for roughly half of the $6 trillion investment-grade sector, and GE alone would account for 10 percent of the junk bond market should it ever lose its investment-grade rating.  One of GE\u2019s most active bonds on Monday, its $11.5 billion of 4.418 percent notes due in November 2035, jumped 2.6 points in price to regain the 90 cents on the dollar level for the first time since late October. In mid-November they had dropped to as low as 77 cents on the dollar.  The spread of their yield over Treasuries, a measure of the additional compensation demanded by investors for holding riskier securities, narrowed to a four-month low of 222 basis points, having tightened by about 200 basis points since November.  The announcement also further eased concerns about GE\u2019s solvency that had grown markedly last year, reflected in a surge in the price for GE credit default swaps, a form of insurance against default, during the fourth quarter. On Monday, however, GE\u2019s CDS prices sank to their lowest since mid-October.","119":"HOUSTON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - General Electric Co on Wednesday said it had no plans to exit its investment in oilfield services firm Baker Hughes, A GE Company, before a two-year lockup period.  \u201cGiven today\u2019s valuation levels, we see a lot of upside there.

Known as \u201cNeutron Jack\u201d for cutting thousands of jobs, Welch bought and sold scores of businesses, expanded the industrial giant into financial services and produced steadily rising profits. His success led other CEOs to begin using financial wizardry to improve earnings and wow Wall Street.  In Welch\u2019s 20 years as CEO, GE\u2019s market value grew from $12 billion to $410 billion, making him one of the most iconic corporate leaders of his era.  \u201cWhen the book about business leaders in this century is written, Jack Welch will be near the very top,\u201d said Thomas Cooke, professor at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business. \u201cWhat he did as the leader of GE was remarkable.\u201d  President Donald Trump tweeted: \u201cThere was no corporate leader like \u201cneutron\u201d Jack,\u201d adding his warmest sympathies \u201cto his wonderful wife & family!\u201d  But Welch\u2019s innovations, which included ruthless personnel management, cost cutting and offshoring, also set the stage for problems that would hit the company years after he left.  John F. Welch, Jr., followed Reginald Jones as CEO in April 1981 and served in that role until he retired in September 2001, choosing Jeff Immelt as his successor.  Two of Welch's other top disciples - and Immelt rivals - left GE to head other major companies, helping spread Welch's gospel: Jim McNerney at Boeing Co BA.N and Bob Nardelli at Chrysler and Home Depot Inc HD.N.  \u201cToday is a sad day for the entire GE family,\u201d current GE Chairman and CEO Larry Culp said in a statement. \u201cJack was larger than life and the heart of GE for half a century. He reshaped the face of our company and the business world.\u201d  The outsized financing business Welch built nearly toppled GE during the 2008 financial crisis, requiring a bailout from legendary investor Warren Buffett. Immelt sold most of GE Capital and GE now trades at a fraction of its peak value.  The stock closed at $11.21 on Monday, up 3%. It peaked at $57.68 in August 2000, according to Eikon data from Refinitiv.  Welch acquired new businesses and did not hesitate to use layoffs and outsourcing to streamline them, sometimes leaving shattered, embittered communities behind. He faced criticism - particularly after he retired from GE - for his cavalier attitude about offshoring and shutting U.S. plants, a theme that has grown more potent since the election of President Trump.  The U.S. industrial belt is dotted with communities devastated by GE\u2019s downsizing. At its peak, for instance, GE employed 30,000 at a sprawling integrated industrial plant in Schenectady, New York, that now employs fewer than 3,000.  Both Welch\u2019s style of management and the strategy he pursued to expand GE have since fallen from favor. CEOs who order mass layoffs now get attacked in tweets from the Oval Office, and Wall Street has lost its appetite for conglomerates.  Welch also made GE a training ground for business leaders and advocated aggressively ousting poor performers. In a 2001 New Yorker interview, he said, \u201cIf they\u2019re in the bottom 10, they get zero raises, zero stock options, they don\u2019t get a bit of bonus, they get zero.\u201d  Thomas F. O\u2019Boyle, author of the 1998 book \u201cAt Any Cost: Jack Welch, General Electric, and the Pursuit of Profit,\u201d was an early critic of Welch\u2019s tenure. In an interview on Monday, O\u2019Boyle said: \u201cYou have to look at the totality of what occurred based on the strategy Welch initiated: the de-emphasizing of manufacturing, offshoring as many jobs as possible, and emphasizing financial services in GE Capital for earnings growth.\u201d  O\u2019Boyle noted that 80% of the some 1,000 acquisitions under Welch were in financial services. \u201cAnd that strategy had terrible, terrible consequences for General Electric in the long run.\u201d  Slideshow ( 7 images )  A DIMINISHED CONGLOMERATE  In 1980, the year before Welch became CEO, GE recorded revenues of $26.8 billion; in 2000, the year before he left, they were nearly $130 billion. In 2001, GE was one of the largest and most valuable companies in the world, up from America\u2019s tenth-largest by market cap in 1981.  Yet today, GE has sold most of the divisions Welch added, and many fault him for much of GE\u2019s recent decline.  \u201cHe was lauded in business schools, and many CEOs considered him a role model, but few today would praise his tactics,\u201d said Erik Gordon, assistant professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business. \u201cHe left a bloated, hollow mess to his successors. GE went from being a titan of industry to a dismembered wreck.\u201d  Slideshow ( 7 images )  The company spun off its insurance business into Genworth Financial Inc GNW.N in 2004, for example, but kept a large batch of money-losing policies written during Welch's tenure. Those forced GE in 2018 to take a $6.2 billion charge and set aside $15 billion in reserves.  In 2015, activist investor Nelson Pelz\u2019s Trian Partners bought a $2.5 billion stake in GE and pushed for further focus on core industrial businesses, prompting Immelt to sell most of the remaining parts of GE Capital.  ENGINEER BY TRAINING  Born in 1935, Welch earned his B.S. degree in chemical engineering at the University of Massachusetts, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in chemical engineering at the University of Illinois in 1960.  That same year, Welch joined GE as a chemical engineer at its plastics division in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. He was elected the company\u2019s youngest vice president in 1972 and became vice chairman in 1979.  While his GE career is mostly seen as an upward trajectory, it included an early setback. In 1963, the Pittsfield plastics factory had an explosion that tore off the roof, and Welch was nearly fired. He later touted the experience as part of what created his management approach, noting that a manager at the time talked him through what he could have done better.  Books by Welch include \u201cWinning,\u201d from 2005. He co-wrote a column with his wife Suzy Welch for Reuters and other media.  \u201cBefore you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others,\u201d Welch wrote in \u201cWinning.\u201d","121":"April 29 (Reuters) - General Electric Co:  * GE - COVID-19 CHALLENGED FIRST-QUARTER RESULTS  * GE - QTRLY CONTINUING EPS (GAAP) OF $0.72  * GE - QTRLY TOTAL REVENUES (GAAP) $20.5 BILLION, DOWN 8%  * GE - QTRLY INDUSTRIAL ORGANIC REVENUE $18.9 BILLION, DOWN 5%  * GE - QTRLY ADJUSTED EPS $0.05  * GE QTRLY NET EPS $0.70  * GE - QTRLY INDUSTRIAL FREE CASH OUTFLOW $2.2 BILLION  * GE - TARGETING MORE THAN $2 BILLION IN OPERATIONAL COST OUT AND $3 BILLION OF CASH PRESERVATION  * GE - SECOND QUARTER WILL BE THE FIRST FULL QUARTER WITH PRESSURE FROM COVID-19, AND GE EXPECTS THAT ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS WILL DECLINE SEQUENTIALLY  * GE - QTRLY POWER SEGMENT ORDERS OF $4.1 BILLION WERE UP 12% REPORTED  * GE QTRLY AVIATION ORDERS OF $7.4 BILLION WERE DOWN 14% REPORTED AND 13% ORGANICALLY  * GE QTRLY AVIATION REVENUES OF $6.9 BILLION WERE DOWN 13% REPORTED AND 11% ORGANICALLY  * GE - QTRLY POWER SEGMENT REVENUES OF $4.0 BILLION WERE DOWN 13% REPORTED AND 12% ORGANICALLY  * GE - MOST SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL IMPACT TO DATE AT AVIATION & GECAS, WHERE COVID-19 CAUSED RAPID DECLINE IN GLOBAL COMMERCIAL AVIATION DEMAND IN MARCH  * Q1 EARNINGS PER SHARE VIEW $0.08, REVENUE VIEW $20.21 BILLION -- REFINITIV IBES DATA  * GE - GE CAPITAL REDUCED EXTERNAL DEBT BY $10 BILLION YEAR TO DATE, INCLUDING $4.7 BILLION OF MATURITIES IN THE FIRST QUARTER  * GE - GE REDUCED COMMERCIAL PAPER USE BY $1.1 BILLION IN FIRST QUARTER  * GE - Q1 CONTINUING EPS, INCLUDE $11.1 BILLION AFTER-TAX GAIN POST BIOPHARMA SALE, $4.6 BILLION AFTER-TAX UNREALIZED LOSS ON MARKING INVESTMENT IN BAKER HUGHES  * GE - COVID-19 FACTORS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED GE CFOA AND GE INDUSTRIAL FREE CASH FLOW BY ABOUT $1 BILLION IN QUARTER  * GE - COVID-19 FACTORS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED GE INDUSTRIAL PROFIT BY ABOUT $0.8 BILLION AND GE CAPITAL EARNINGS BY ABOUT $0.1 BILLION IN QUARTER  * GE - EXCLUDING RESTRUCTURING OF $0.1 BILLION, ADJUSTED GE INDUSTRIAL PROFIT WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY $0.7 BILLION IN QUARTER BY COVID-19 FACTORS  * GE - COVID-19 CHALLENGED FIRST-QUARTER RESULTS; TAKING SWIFT ACTION TO MITIGATE IMPACT & SOLIDIFY FINANCIAL POSITION Source text : [ID:invent.ge\/35eAkXL] Further company coverage:","122":"(Adds detail)  BAGHDAD, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Iraq has signed agreements with General Electric and Siemens (SIEGn.DE) over potential deals to develop the country\u2019s power infrastructure, the electricity ministry said on Sunday.

On Wednesday, GE said its power unit will need at least three years to halt its cash hemorrhage and restore its prior cash flow to double-digit cash margins. GE has said it expects to lose up to $2 billion in cash this year, mostly due to the power unit.  \u201cPower was a very significant negative cash flow generator last year. We expect it to be also significantly negative this year,\u201d GE Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller said at an investor conference hosted by Goldman Sachs.  GE shares closed down 0.6% at $10.26 on Wednesday.  Some investors had seen the orders report as signaling a nascent turnaround at the power unit, which lost a staggering $22.8 billion last year, mainly due to a large goodwill writedown.  But others saw GE losing ground to Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems (MHPS) and Siemens. GE \u201cappears to be stopping short of telling the whole story,\u201d JPMorgan analyst Steve Tusa wrote in a note on Wednesday.

Excluding those, GE booked just three advanced class orders in the quarter, including one from GE Capital, its own finance arm, Tusa noted.

A McCoy tally of orders by gigawatts also showed erosion in GE\u2019s market share, Tusa said.  \u201cGE\u2019s 4.5 gigawatt order number (and 40.4% market share) has generated a buzz across a Street consensus hungry for positive data points,\u201d Tusa wrote, noting GE has historically commanded 50% market share.  \u201cA closer look shows externally sold utility-grade heavy duty gas turbine orders of about 1 gigawatt, well below both Siemens and Mitsubishi (about 2.5+ gigawatts each) and far from a signal of a change in trend or upside.\u201d  GE declined to comment on the JPMorgan report, and said \u201cthe Power turnaround remains in the early stages.\u201d  Miller said power will take two to three years to \u201cwork through\u201d lingering pension costs, unprofitable contracts and liabilities from its 2015 acquisition of Alstom, she said. GE\u2019s forecasts do not include an economic downturn, in part because of long purchase cycles and large order backlogs on GE products, she added.

REUTERS\/Vincent Kessler  (Reuters) - General Electric GE.N expects to burn more cash than expected in the second quarter, as the industrial conglomerate struggles with weakness in its aviation business due to the coronavirus crisis, Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp said on Thursday.  Shares of GE, which makes aircraft engines and power plants, fell as much as 3.6% to $7.03 after Culp also warned that the company\u2019s 2020 free cash flow will be negative.  GE\u2019s second-quarter free cash outflow is expected to be between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion, he said at a conference. That was bigger than analysts\u2019 average estimate of an outflow of $2.5 billion, according to Refnitiv IBES data.  The COVID-19 pandemic has brought air travel to a virtual standstill, hitting GE\u2019s aviation business at a time when its power business was struggling with sluggish demand.  The company has cut thousands of jobs in a bid to save cash and last month pulled its full-year forecast, citing the uncertainty caused by the pandemic.  \u201cLosing that much money adds meaningfully to GE\u2019s elevated net leverage burden,\u201d Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch said, adding that the magnitude of cash outflow at GE places it out of step with most of its industrial peers.  Culp said GE\u2019s commercial jet engine installs would fall about 45% in the second quarter, with sales of aircraft spares declining about 60%.  The coronavirus crisis, however, has boosted sales of the company\u2019s healthcare products, with second-quarter orders expected to rise more than 100%, Culp said.","132":"March 5 (Reuters) - General Electric Co said on Tuesday it expects free cash flow from its industrial business to be negative in 2019, mainly due to continuing weakness in its power unit.

In January, Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp said that he expects industrial free cash flow to weaken in 2019 as it spends on restructuring in its power and renewables divisions, but will increase \"substantially\" in 2020 and 2021. reut.rs\/2u05kcl (Reporting by Rachit Vats in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)","133":"(Reuters) - General Electric Co beat estimates for sales and cash flow in the fourth quarter and said on Thursday it had reached a tentative deal to settle a subprime mortgage case with U.S. regulators, sending its shares sharply higher.

GE\u2019s bond prices also rose sharply. In afternoon trading, the stock was up about 12 percent at $10.22.  The 2018 results cap one of GE\u2019s worst years, starting with an $11 billion charge and disclosure of accounting investigations by U.S. regulators, and ending with fears about GE\u2019s liquidity and even the continued existence of what once was America\u2019s most famous and valuable company. Even with Thursday\u2019s gains, GE shares are down 65 percent over the past two years.  Many analysts and investors had braced for disappointing results and were relieved that new Chief Executive Larry Culp was able to show some improvement while being blunt about bad news. Culp offered only a scant forecast, however, delaying details for a meeting to be scheduled soon.  Still, Culp set targets that matched what analysts and investors have been requesting: lifting GE\u2019s triple-B credit rating to single-A quality, reducing industrial debt to less than 2.5 times operating income, and even restoring the dividend. Culp did not set a time frame for those goals.  GE also announced a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice over its subprime mortgage practices before the 2008 financial crisis. GE will pay a $1.5 billion civil penalty, money it has already set aside.  Culp ruled out selling GE\u2019s $40-billion aircraft leasing unit, quelling concerns that jettisoning the profitable unit would sink GE Capital. He also said GE is \u201creviewing every single project and contract\u201d in its power unit.  Investors seemed euphoric, if a little myopic. \u201cThe only relevant data in the quarterly numbers is that actual sales and the free cash flow from the industrials business were better than expected,\u201d William Blair analyst Nicholas Heymann said.  GE\u2019s lengthy presentation contained numerous warnings and unknowns. Cash is likely to decline in 2019, but GE would not say by how much; GE is still in \u201cearly innings\u201d of turning around its power business, where revenue will fall again in 2019; and GE will provide detail about its toxic long-term care insurance liabilities in February. It took a $65-million charge for insurance in the latest quarter, compared with a $6.2 billion charge and $15 billion in provisions a year ago.  It also did not provide more detail on ongoing regulatory investigations of its accounting for long-term care policies and power-plant services contracts.  BETTER THAN EXPECTED RESULTS  \u201cThe results are better than expected because expectations were so low,\u201d said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. \u201cThe company still faces the huge challenges of managing its mountain of debt and restoring investor confidence in the accuracy of its numbers.\u201d  But some said Culp\u2019s new candor and an investor relations chief plucked from Wall Street had gone a long way to restoring credibility after years of happy talk, earnings landmines and a class-action lawsuit that alleges accounting fraud.  \u201cPower is still in free-fall,\u201d said Scott Davis, analyst at Melius Research, in a note. But GE is providing \u201can honest assessment of the problems and (a) realistic plan to fix them ... So the relief rally is explainable.\u201d  The results showed GE had strengthened its cash position and chipped away $21 billion from its massive debt, two issues that hit the stock in tumultuous 2018.  The 127-year-old conglomerate was booted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, had its credit ratings cut to three notches above junk, slashed its quarterly dividend to a penny, restated earnings for the prior two years and saw a $10 billion fossil-fuel power acquisition turn sour as wind and solar power gained momentum while GE\u2019s gas-turbine business struggled with faulty turbine blades.  GE said its power unit took $400 million in charges in the fourth quarter, including a small amount for blade repairs at dozens of customers around the world. That was on top of $240 million for blade repairs in the third quarter.  GE booked a $666 million profit for the fourth quarter and revenue rose 5 percent to $33.3 billion, above analyst estimates of $32.6 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES.  Industrial free cash flow of $4.9 billion in the quarter, topped the $4 billion threshold that investors were looking to beat, Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch wrote in a note.

Jet\u2019s troubles have been worsened by a rising debt-pile, amid intense competition in the Indian aviation sector and higher oil prices.  In the latest effort to save itself, the airline will now seek shareholder approval next month to convert existing debt into equity.  Earlier in the day, media reports said that Jet had been asked by GECAS, the aircraft financing and leasing business of General Electric Co, to ground at least five Boeing 737 planes due to non-payment of dues.  Jet said in its statement that it had not ground any aircraft due to a notice from GECAS.  The airline is in the process of delivering three aircraft to lessors due to the scheduled expiry of lease terms, it said here in a statement.  Jet added that three of its aircraft were temporarily grounded for engine normalization, which is expected to be completed by Friday. Two others were on ground - one for scheduled termination of the engine\u2019s lease and another for technical reasons.  Crisis talks between the airline and its lessors had failed to ease a row over late payments, prompting some lessors to explore taking back aircraft, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this month.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Attorney General Letitia James, both Democrats, accused Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s administration of siding with \u201cbig polluters\u201d by accepting PCB levels that constitute a known health risk and leave Hudson River fish \u201ctoo toxic\u201d to eat.  \u201cSince the EPA has failed to hold GE accountable for restoring the river, New York is taking action to demand a full and complete remediation,\u201d Cuomo said in a statement.  The EPA did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but has said its decisionmaking was not politically driven.  GE had spent an estimated $1.7 billion to clean up the river over eight years, including six years of dredging, under a 2006 consent decree.  Mark Behan, a GE spokesman, said the EPA found that the Boston-based company had met its cleanup obligations, and that New York\u2019s own data showed that 99% of sampled locations in the upper Hudson met state cleanup standards.  \u201cEnvironmental conditions in the Hudson will continue to improve and GE will continue to cooperate,\u201d he added.  New York filed its lawsuit in the federal court in Albany, the state\u2019s capital, seeking to void GE\u2019s completion certificate and block its reissuance until the cleanup is done right.  PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, were used in electrical equipment, carbonless copy paper and other products before a 1979 U.S. manufacturing ban, and are considered possible human carcinogens.  Two since-closed GE capacitor manufacturing plants north of Albany dumped roughly 650 tons of PCBs into the river between 1947 and 1977.  About 200 miles of the river were polluted, stretching as far south as Battery Park in Manhattan, though most pollution occurred in a 40-mile (64-km) zone near the plants.  State officials said about 54 tons of PCBs remain in the upper Hudson, roughly 13 tons more than the EPA expected when it found dredging necessary, and that PCB levels in fish remain three times higher than the agency\u2019s goal.","139":"NEW YORK, Oct 1 (Reuters) - While John Flannery\u2019s tenure at the helm of General Electric was far shorter than that of his predecessor Jeff Immelt, the two former chiefs have one thing in common: They both presided over a sharp drop in GE shares.  The U.S. industrial conglomerate on Monday ousted Flannery as chief executive officer in a surprise move, replacing him with outsider and board member Larry Culp.  In Culp, GE is tapping a former head of another industrial company, Danaher Corp. Culp led Danaher from 2000 to 2014, helping grow an industrial company into a broader conglomerate through a series of acquisitions, while growing earnings.  Danaher\u2019s stock soared over that time and prospered while GE\u2019s has struggled.  Flannery\u2019s departure comes as he was trying to turn around GE, including through a series of major planned divestitures from the sprawling company.  GE has continued to struggle, including with a recent issue with problems with turbines in its important power unit.  GE\u2019s share price suffered under Flannery, falling more than 50 percent since he took over last August. Under Immelt, GE\u2019s shares lost more than a third of their value.  GE\u2019s valuation, based on price-to-earnings ratios, also has declined, making the shares far cheaper than those of rival diversified industrial companies. The stock was up nearly 9 percent to $12.29 in Monday trading after the CEO announcement.  \u201cInvestors grew impatient with the lack of improvement and with the sheer scale of the problems uncovered; however, these problems were not created under his tenure,\u201d CFRA Research analyst Jim Corridore said in a note.  Indeed, GE\u2019s revenue and profit has declined over the years, in part as GE has pulled back from finance and other businesses.

REUTERS\/Alwyn Scott\/File Photo  Analysts said the move would largely offset the rise in GE\u2019s pension obligations due to lower interest rates and was in line with other steps Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp has taken over the past year to raise cash and pare down $105.8 billion in debt.  Culp has slashed GE\u2019s quarterly dividend to a penny and has sold - or announced plans to sell - non-core businesses, slimming the once-sprawling company to focus just on power plants, jet engines and windmills, plus related equipment and services.  GE\u2019s pension plans are among its biggest liabilities and were underfunded by about $27 billion at the end of 2018. U.S. employees facing the pension freeze will be moved to a defined-contribution retirement plan, such as a 401(k) plan, in 2021.  The company has struggled to boost profits amid a slump in demand for its gas-fired turbines for power generation. It also faces potential costs of more than $1 billion in its jet engine unit from the grounding of Boeing Co\u2019s 737 MAX airliner.  GE also is likely to set aside about $11 billion to cover liabilities for its long-term care insurance business.  By freezing the U.S. pensions, pre-paying about $4.5 billion in contributions due in 2021 and 2022 and offering lump sums to about 100,000 retirees, GE said it expects to cut pension underfunding by $5 billion to $8 billion.  William Blair & Co. analyst Nicholas Heymann said there was no immediate net reduction in GE\u2019s pension liabilities given the 90 basis-point decline in long-term interest rates since the end of last year, which has caused its pension liabilities to creep up to about $34 billion from $27 billion toward the end of 2018.  \u201cThe impact is being offset now, rather being reduced. So it is possible that investors are not cheering,\u201d Heymann told Reuters. He added, though, that Culp \u201cis setting up (GE for) much better performance next year.\u201d  GE\u2019s shares were down 0.2% at $8.55 in afternoon trading, after rising 2.6% to $8.79 in premarket trading.  The pension freeze takes effect Jan. 1, 2021.  The moves also are expected to help lower GE\u2019s net debt by $4 billion to $6 billion, the Boston-based company said, adding that there would be no change for retirees already collecting pension benefits.  GE\u2019s industrial net debt stood at $54.4 billion as of June 30.  \u201cReturning GE to a position of strength has required us to make several difficult decisions, and today\u2019s decision to freeze the pension is no exception,\u201d GE Chief Human Resources Officer Kevin Cox said in a press release.  GE\u2019s pension plan has been closed to new entrants since 2012. The company had about 283,000 employees at the end of 2018, about 97,000 of them in the United States.  GE expects to record a non-cash pension settlement charge in the fourth quarter, but did not specify the amount.  The company also said it would pre-fund about $4 billion to $5 billion of its requirements for 2021 and 2022 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by using a portion of the $38 billion in cash it is collecting from the sale of various businesses.  GE said it was on track to hit its target of less than 2.5 times net-debt-to-earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, by the end of 2020.","144":"(Repeats to additional customers with no changes to text)  NEW YORK, May 24 (Reuters) - Vistra Energy Corp and Dominion Energy Inc \u2013 which serve about 5.5 million electricity customers in more than a dozen U.S. states \u2013 both say they are done building combined-cycle natural gas-fired power plants.  Instead, they are building large solar plants, which offer plentiful and inexpensive electricity.  This bearish view of fossil-fuel energy, reflective of a growing acceptance by utilities of renewable power sources, poses a hurdle to John Flannery\u2019s plan to turn around General Electric Co\u2019s $35 billion-a-year power unit.  GE\u2019s chief executive spelled out the difficulty on Wednesday. Power profits will be flat this year after falling 53 percent in 2017, he said, and GE is planning that demand for heavy-duty natural gas power plants will be less than half what it forecast just over a year ago, and will stay at that level through 2020.  New plant sales are \u201cgoing to be tough,\u201d Flannery said at an investor conference on Wednesday. \u201cThis is not going to be a quick fix, but there is, at the end of the day, long-life assets here with intrinsic economic value. We\u2019re going to make the most of what we have there.\u201d  In the long run, Flannery and Russell Stokes, the head of GE Power, have said demand for electricity and natural gas power generators will grow about 2 percent a year - in line with global forecasts - as utilities make a gradual transition to renewable power.  Following a strategy he laid out in November, Flannery is cutting 12,000 jobs and $2.5 billion in costs at the unit. On Wednesday, he said GE has tripled some sales incentives in the power division and is competing aggressively for new contracts to maintain plants and to get the call when utilities need parts or repairs during an unexpected outage, something of which GE had lost sight.  But some analysts and investors are skeptical about the long-term prospects of a business devoted to natural gas and coal power plants that are falling out of favor with utilities.  The competition from solar and wind, along with abundant low-priced gas produced by fracking, is curbing orders for new plants and forcing the closure of old ones. Some utilities are even filing for bankruptcy.  \u201cThat means companies are going to have trouble selling new fossil-fuel plants,\u201d said Mark Dyson, a principal at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an organization that researches the power industry.  Over 126 years, GE has weathered ups and downs in power market before, and has legions of sales and service people around the world. Last year it booked 26 orders for its newest gas turbines in Mexico, Bangladesh and elsewhere. It is investing in its separate, $10 billion-a-year renewables unit focused on wind and hydro, which saw revenue fall 6 percent last year. GE also sells battery storage, software and smart-grid technology to work with wind and solar systems.  GE power equipment orders - an indicator of future sales - fell 41 percent in the first quarter, accelerating from a 17 percent drop last year, according to GE\u2019s earnings reports.  GE\u2019s performance reflects the broader trend of utilities shifting to renewables from fossil fuels.  Global sales of large natural gas power plants have fallen by half since 2013, according to McCoy Power Reports. Coal and gas-fired plants accounted for just 38 percent of new electricity capacity financed globally last year, down from 71 percent a decade ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. Solar and wind now draw 53 percent of such investment, up from 22 percent, a Reuters analysis shows.  For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs\/2I7QAxf  Rivals Siemens AG and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries are cautious about the scope for growth.  \u201cWe see a structural change,\u201d Lisa Davis, the chief executive officer of Siemens Corp, the U.S. unit, said in an interview. \u201cThere are fewer large units being sold globally than there were five years ago. I don\u2019t see that changing dramatically going forward.\u201d  Siemens is cutting 6,100 power and gas jobs to adjust.  Many utilities share the view that the shift is permanent because it is driven by economics rather than government policy and climate-change concerns. While conventional power plants will continue to be built, sales may never reach the levels seen just two years ago, industry experts said.  With electricity prices trending downward, utilities are increasingly unwilling to risk capital on a new plant unless then can lock in a long-term price, executives said.  \u201cBuilding new large, combined-cycle gas plants is challenging without the stability of a long-term power contract,\u201d said Timothy Menzie, chief executive officer of InterGen, an international power generation company.  POWER PLAYER  GE faces a further challenge: long-term erosion of the large base of plants it services. After acquiring the Alstom power business in 2015, GE has a base of customers that produces one-third of the world\u2019s electricity. Long-term contracts to service those plants bring GE billions of dollars in annual revenue.  But as utilities close older coal and gas-fired plants, the revenue growth from services is under pressure.  Wind and solar can cost as little as $18 a megawatt hour, compared with $40 for a large gas plant, said Mikael Backman, North America regional director at Wartsila Energy Solutions, part of the Finnish company that makes quick-start natural gas-fired generators.  Across much of the United States, some utilities now buy all the cheap renewable power they can on electricity markets and use quick-start gas engines to fill in when wind and sun falter. In California, regulators have put on hold a project that planned to buy one of GE\u2019s large natural-gas turbines while Southern California Edison, which planned to buy the power, studies using wind and solar instead.  The shift from fossil fuels stretches beyond states like California, which is aggressively switching to renewable power.  In oil-rich Texas, wind and solar now provide 21 percent of the state\u2019s electricity. Utilities there are shutting down the equivalent of about 20 average-sized coal plants this year, according a Reuters analysis of data from power system operator ERCOT. Out of 183 power-generation projects on the drawing boards, only four would run on fossil fuels, ERCOT said. The rest are wind and solar.  ExGen Texas Power, an affiliate of Exelon Corp, filed for bankruptcy protection in November for five natural-gas plants, the second such bankruptcy in Texas last year attributed to low power prices. GE supplied parts and service to several of the plants, according to the bankruptcy filings. Reuters could not determine whether the contracts will remain in effect.  In Virginia, Dominion Energy ended several maintenance contracts it had with GE this year when it mothballed a large gas-fired plant built by companies GE later acquired and idled seven other coal and natural gas units in the state.  Dominion aims to build 4,720 megawatts of solar by 2033, the equivalent of about five large combined-cycle power plants.  It is opening a new combined-cycle natural-gas plant in Virginia this year, built with GE and Mitsubishi equipment. It said it has no current plans to build more such plants.  \u201cSolar is very cheap,\u201d spokesman Dan Genest said. \u201cThese units were just not cutting it.\u201d","145":"March 2 (Reuters) - General Electric Co's former chief executive officer Jack Welch, who led the industrial conglomerate for two decades, has died, CNBC reported here on Monday.

The four multinational companies, with a combined market capitalization of nearly $600 billion at Thursday\u2019s market close, are the largest foreign enterprises to be investigated in an unprecedented anti-corruption push in Brazil in recent years.  Big U.S. and European companies found to have engaged in wrongdoing in Brazil could also face heavy fines and other punishment under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Since 1977, that law has made it illegal for American citizens, U.S. companies or foreign companies whose securities are listed in the United States to pay foreign officials to win business.  Foreign companies are the latest targets of government corruption probes in Brazil. Over the past five years, prosecutors have uncovered pervasive graft in state institutions and private-sector companies seeking to do business with them.  The sprawling investigations by prosecutors and federal police, including the famed \u201cCar Wash\u201d dragnet centered on Brazil\u2019s state-run oil company Petrobras, have toppled business and political leaders across Latin America.  Authorities say plea-bargain testimonies obtained from suspects alerted them to other possible schemes, including alleged bribes paid by multinationals to obtain public contracts in Brazil.  \u2018CONSTANTLY SHARING\u2019  Brazilian federal prosecutor Marisa Ferrari confirmed in an interview with Reuters that U.S. authorities from the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission were assisting in the Brazilian medical equipment investigation she helps lead.  In 2016, U.S. and Brazilian prosecutors jointly negotiated the world\u2019s largest-ever compliance penalty, a $3.5 billion fine against Brazilian construction conglomerate Odebrecht SA for its part in the Car Wash scandal.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  \u201cWe are constantly sharing information with the FBI on this (medical equipment) case. They ask for documents and we send them, and they are assisting our investigation in return,\u201d Ferrari said. In addition, she said, \u201cWe\u2019ve received a lot of material from the Department of Justice and from the SEC.\u201d  She declined to name which companies U.S. law enforcement agencies were investigating.  Two Brazilian investigators with direct knowledge of the matter confirmed to Reuters that Johnson & Johnson, Siemens, GE, and Koninklijke Philips NV were being targeted by the FBI for alleged bribery in Brazil. The people requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the U.S. side of the investigation.  The FBI would not confirm or deny the existence of any investigations. The SEC, which also investigates FCPA allegations, said by email that it declined to comment.  Boston-based GE declined to comment on any investigation related to its business in Brazil. It said in an emailed statement, \u201cWe are committed to integrity, compliance and the rule of law in Brazil and every other country in which we do business.\u201d  Siemens, which is based in Munich, Germany, said in an emailed statement that the company \u201cis not aware of any FBI investigation of the company related to cartel activity in Brazil.\u201d It said its policy is always to cooperate with law enforcement investigations when they occur.  Amsterdam-based Philips confirmed in an email that it is under investigation in Brazil. In its 2018 annual report, Philips acknowledged that it \u201chas also received inquiries from certain US authorities in respect to this matter.\u201d  In its emailed response to Reuters, Philips said, \u201cIt is not uncommon for US authorities to show an interest in these matters and it is too early to draw any conclusions.\u201d  New Brunswick, New Jersey-based Johnson & Johnson said in an emailed response on Friday that in an SEC filing last October it disclosed that the Department of Justice and the SEC \u201chave made preliminary inquiries to the company\u201d in regard to a raid by Brazilian federal police on its Sao Paulo offices last year, and that the company is cooperating.  \u2018TRULY MASSIVE\u2019  Ferrari, the Brazilian prosecutor, said the medical equipment investigation was in its early stages. Still, she said evidence points to widespread bribery and price gouging by firms looking to tap into Brazil\u2019s public healthcare system, one of the world\u2019s largest, serving 210 million people.  \u201cBecause the Brazilian government\u2019s health budget is so huge, this scheme is truly massive,\u201d Ferrari said. \u201cThis first case is just a tiny sliver of what is to come.\u201d  In addition to paying kickbacks through intermediaries to secure contracts, some suppliers charged Brazil\u2019s government inflated prices - up to eight times the market price - to help cover the cost of their bribes, according to court filings and plea-bargain testimony secured by prosecutors.  GE\u2019s former chief executive for Latin America, Daurio Speranzini, and 22 others were charged last year in the first case stemming from the alleged scheme.  Prosecutors say that in that case, which focused on Rio de Janeiro state, Brazilian taxpayers were bilked out of at least 600 million reais ($149.38 million) between 2007 and 2018 through padded contracts awarded to crooked medical equipment suppliers.  Lawyers for Speranzini, who left GE in November, said by email that he is innocent.  GE said in a statement on Friday that \u201callegations refer to a time period\u201d when Speranzini was not working for the firm. \u201cBased on our review, we believe there is no evidence of misconduct or any indication of GE being part of this cartel.\u201d  However, prosecutors cite in court filings the plea-deal testimony of former Rio de Janeiro-state health secretary Cesar Romero as stating that GE was a member of the cartel, which he said was known by its members as the \u201cInternational Bidding Club.\u201d  \u201cIn fact, from the analysis of evidence collected in wire tapping ... it was possible to see that Daurio Speranzini Junior continued to close spurious contracts with the government,\u201d prosecutors wrote in requesting the former GE executive\u2019s arrest last year.  Prosecutors allege Speranzini first took part in the cartel as the head of the Philips Healthcare operation in Latin America from 2004 until the end of 2010. A whistleblower told Philips\u2019 compliance office about the fraud, and Speranzini was fired after an internal probe, according to the documents.  He was hired by GE a few months after leaving Philips. Investigators say they have strong evidence that Speranzini continued with the scheme while at GE.  GE declined to comment on Speranzini\u2019s hiring or exit from the company.","147":"June 15 (Reuters) - General Electric Co:  * DAVID JOYCE TO RETIRE FROM GE; JOHN SLATTERY TO BECOME PRESIDENT AND CEO OF GE AVIATION  * GE - WITH DAVID\u2019S RETIREMENT, JOHN SLATTERY, NAMED PRESIDENT- AND CEO-ELECT OF GE AVIATION, EFFECTIVE JULY 13.  * GE - JOHN SLATTERY WILL FULLY ASSUME ROLE OF PRESIDENT AND CEO OF GE AVIATION ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2020  * GE - SLATTERY LED EMBRAER\u2019S LARGEST BUSINESS, COMMERCIAL AVIATION  * GE - JOYCE ALSO WILL CONTINUE AS GE VICE CHAIR AND ADVISOR TO GE RESEARCH THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2020  * GE - JOYCE SUBSEQUENTLY WILL SERVE AS STRATEGIC ADVISOR TO GE AVIATION INTO 2021 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","148":"(Reuters) - General Electric Co, once seen as the epitome of corporate greatness, is trying to end infighting between its divisions, tighten up management and fix quality problems in its products, Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp said on Wednesday.

GE said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice had expanded investigations to include the $22-billion writedown of goodwill from the power division that the company reported on Tuesday. GE shares slid on the New York Stock Exchange, touching their lowest in more than nine years.  The company posted a staggering loss of $22.8 billion in the third quarter, among the largest in U.S. corporate history. The 126-year-old company, once the most valuable U.S. corporation, has announced more than $40 billion in writedowns and charges in less than a year.  Culp, who took over on Oct. 1, said GE will significantly miss its full-year cash flow target of about $6 billion. He said he could not estimate full-year results until he gets more detail about the ailing power unit, which lost $631 million in the third quarter.  GE all but eliminated its quarterly dividend, cutting it to a penny from 12 cents a share to conserve about $4 billion in cash and strengthen the balance sheet. Analysts viewed that positively, relieved that Culp said there were no plans to raise equity capital as some had feared.  \u201cMy priorities in my first 100 days are positioning our businesses to win, starting with Power, and accelerating deleveraging,\u201d Culp said in the results statement.  GE shares closed down 8.8 percent at $10.18.  NEW POWER STRUCTURE  In June, former CEO John Flannery, who was on the job for just 14 months, said GE would pare its portfolio to jet engines, power plants and renewable energy by disposing of its healthcare and Baker Hughes units, along with other restructuring already in the works.  On Tuesday, Culp said GE will put its gas turbine equipment and services businesses in a new unit. Analysts said this probably foreshadows the sale of other assets such as coal and nuclear power plants and power grids.  GE added much of that in 2015 with a $10-billion acquisition of power assets from Alstom SA ALSO.PA, saying it could boost margins and profits. But profits fell as demand for fossil fuel power plants slowed in response to cheaper solar and wind systems. Power services faced stiff competition, and declining use of large power plants has reduced repair revenue.  GE wrote down $22 billion in goodwill in the latest quarter because promised profits from power are now unlikely.  \u201cThey are acknowledging that it is not going to turn around in a hurry,\u201d said Paul Healy, a professor at the Harvard Business School who focuses on corporate financial reporting.  GE\u2019s $22.8 billion loss compared with a $1.3 billion profit a year earlier. Historically, the loss was topped only by losses during the 2008 financial crisis at insurer AIG and oil company ConocoPhillips, according to I\/B\/E\/S data from Refinitiv.  INVESTIGATION DEEPENS  GE has said it learned of regulatory scrutiny last November, when the SEC said it was investigating GE\u2019s accounting for long-term service agreements. That inquiry expanded to include a $6.2 billion charge and $15 billion in reserves GE announced in January.  On Tuesday, GE said the probe now includes accounting that led to the $22 billion goodwill write-off. The U.S. Justice Department also is investigating GE\u2019s mortgage-backed securities transactions during the housing bubble.

GE has moved to dismiss the claims.  GE\u2019s per-share loss was $2.63 versus 16 cents profit a year ago. Revenue declined 4 percent to $29.6 billion. Adjusted earnings fell to 14 cents a share from 21 cents a year ago. Analysts had expected 20 cents a share, according to Refinitiv data.  Orders at the power division fell 18 percent and revenue fell 33 percent in the quarter.  \u201cThe only way out of this mess is to restructure power,\u201d said Scott Davis, analyst at Melius Research in New York. \u201cIt will bottom eventually.\u201d  GE did not cut its full-year earnings forecast as some had expected, but a spokeswoman said the company would not hit the most recent target of $1.00 to $1.07 per share. Analysts have cut estimates for adjusted earnings to 88 cents a share, on average, according to Refinitiv data. The GE spokeswoman said the company was not yet providing new targets.  \u201cI just don\u2019t think Larry has his hands around this fully yet, enough to put his stamp of approval on guidance,\u201d Davis said.  Credit agencies have cut GE\u2019s ratings, increasing its debt costs and its financial challenges, which had prompted talk among analysts that it would issue stock to raise capital.","166":"FILE PHOTO: The General Electric Co. logo is seen on the company's corporate headquarters building in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. July 23, 2019.

The giant machines form the beating heart of billon-dollar electricity plants around the world. Analysts consider GE\u2019s success with the new turbines, known as the HA class, critical to rescuing its power division from a steep decline in sales and profits.  \u201cThis issue, if not quickly resolved, could hurt GE\u2019s turbine brand image and market share,\u201d Jim Corridore, an analyst at CFRA, said in a note, cutting his price target to $14 from $15.  GE stock was down 3 percent at $12.49 on the New York Stock Exchange.  The problem was first discovered on turbine blades in a natural gas-fueled turbine operated by Exelon Corp EXC.N in Texas a few weeks ago, GE told Reuters.  The problem forced Exelon to shut down one turbine. Exelon said it shut down its three other units as a precaution.  GE and Exelon said they expect the turbines to return to service soon. Neither company provided details about the oxidation or how it led to the shutdowns.  GE is working with other customers \u201cto address any impacted unit,\u201d GE spokesman Chris Shigas said, adding that 10 other HA turbines in the United States were still operating.  But, he added, \u201cWe expect the same issue will impact other HA units.\u201d  GE has installed 27 HA units in seven countries since they were introduced two years ago, but faces competition from rivals Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems 7011.T and Siemens AG SIEGn.DE.  GE could be forced to pay millions of dollars in compensation to customers and make costly design changes if the problems persist, industry experts said.  The HA turbines have had trouble before. A group of units in Pakistan required costly repairs.  The outage in Texas \u201crepresents a negative development for a company that has little wiggle room for more \u2018shoes to drop,\u2019\u201d J.P.Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa wrote in a note on Thursday, cutting his price target to $10 from $11 a share.

FILE PHOTO: ThyssenKrupp CEO Heinrich Hiesinger stands in front of a huge video screen at the company's annual shareholders meeting in Bochum, Germany, January 19, 2018. REUTERS\/Thilo Schmuelgen\/File Photo  GE said it would spin off its healthcare business and divest its stake in oil services company Baker Hughes BHGE.N following months of shareholder pressure to overhaul its conglomerate structure.  This increases pressure on German firms to speed up their own strategy overhauls, but they will have a harder time pulling off far-reaching reforms proposed by shareholders unless they can win over powerful labor leaders.  This makes partial listings more likely than complete breakups for Volkswagen's VOWG_p.DE truck business, Daimler DAIGn.DE and BMW's BMWG.DE joint mobility division - which includes car-sharing and electric vehicle charging - and some of Continental's CONG.DE businesses such as powertrains and sensors, bankers and executives said.  Radical moves can be blocked by German labor representatives, who command half the seats on the supervisory boards of large corporations, giving them the power to quash strategic moves that could leave a company vulnerable to a hostile takeover or result in job losses.  The success of Thyssenkrupp's TKAG.DE planned steel joint venture with Tata Steel TISC.NS in Europe, for example, hinges on labor approval, even as activist investors push for deeper reforms at the submarines-to-elevators group.  Siemens SIEGn.DE listed its healthcare business and agreed to combine its rail operations with French rival Alstom ALSO.PA, but only because labor reps agreed that a merged Franco-German rail company can better compete with Chinese rolling stock manufacturer CRRC in the long run.  CONGLOMERATE DISCOUNT  Specialized businesses are often more highly valued than conglomerates because in times of growth, high-potential assets do not have to share the balance sheet with lower-return businesses.  \u201cThe advantages from having a diversified conglomerate, for funding purposes for example, are not as pronounced as the valuation discount on conglomerates through complex structures,\u201d said Alexander Mayer, a Goldman Sachs partner in investment banking in Germany.  \u201cCompanies are more vulnerable to takeovers or become targets of activist investors if they are burdened with a conglomerate discount,\u201d Mayer said.  Firms which have reshaped their portfolios through spin-offs and divestments have outperformed their competitors, Goldman Sachs said, a trend which helped asset divestments in Europe reach their highest level since 2007.  LABOR WARNING  But German labor leaders warn that splitting up the country's conglomerates could leave some high-tech divisions small enough to be snapped up by a Chinese rival or become embroiled in a hostile takeover by a financial investor, as happened to British engineering group GKN GKNA.L.  Juergen Kerner, a management board member of Germany\u2019s biggest trade union IG Metall, said: \u201cBreakups are a dangerous way forward.\u201d  The benefits of slimming down have been eroded with the emergence of newly assertive Chinese rivals and technology companies which are not as enthusiastic about such strategies as some activist shareholders, Kerner said.  \u201cGoogle, Amazon, Microsoft are all diversifying,\u201d Kerner said, explaining that these software companies are now dabbling in areas like autonomous vehicles, drones and food delivery.  Chinese, Korean and Japanese conglomerates too remain diversified, which gives them the scale to more easily rebuff takeovers and handle a downturn.  Exposure to several businesses with different growth, margin and cash flow generation rates is still an advantage when the economy tanks in one particular sector, Kerner said.  Specialized companies have fewer ways to cut costs, putting them under pressure to squeeze their suppliers, which could damage the engineering expertise they depend on.  The more specialized companies become, the harder it will be to preserve this supply chain, Kerner said. Germany still has a thriving sector of small and medium-sized companies which serve global conglomerates, he said. Debt rating agencies agree.  In May, Moody\u2019s, in note about auto suppliers, warned that separating stable, cash-generating businesses from high-growth, cash-consuming operations could damage their credit ratings because of \u201csmaller scale and reduced diversification\u201d.  Bankers say reforms at German conglomerates can only succeed if labor leaders are convinced of the industrial logic.  It is not enough simply to say that shareholder value can be created via a breakup, Christian Kames, JP Morgan\u2019s head of investment banking in Germany, told Reuters.  \u201cThe discussion needs to begin with whether it is the right step from a strategic point of view,\u201d Kames told Reuters.  CHINESE RIVALS  A complicating factor is China\u2019s new assertiveness in buying up high-tech businesses at a time when Germany lacks regulatory tools to fend off unwanted takeovers.  Washington has the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to review whether a foreign person can gain control over a U.S. business, but Germany does not have similar protectionist tools.  Chinese buyers bought robot maker Kuka and Geely chairman Li Shufu took a 9 percent stake in Daimler. Li used derivatives to mask his purchase until the last minute, prompting CDU lawmaker Hans Michelbach to demand that the German regulator take action.  Germany is now reviewing how to tighten disclosure rules to prevent another \u201csneak attack\u201d.  \u201cWe would welcome everything which reduces uncertainty in the area of approval processes for international transactions,\u201d Goldman Sachs\u2019 Mayer told Reuters.  \u201cYou need to be able to estimate what works and what does not,\u201d Mayer said.","171":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of German energy utility company Uniper SE is pictured in the company's headquarters in Duesseldorf, Germany, March 10, 2020.

S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Tuesday that GE GE.N, an original member of the Dow when it was formed by Charles Dow in 1896 and a continuous member since 1907, will be replaced in the 30-component stock average by drug store chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc WBA.O prior to the start of trading on June 26. GE\u2019s stock slipped 1.5 percent in after-hours trading following the announcement while Walgreens jumped 3 percent.  A decade and a half ago GE was the world\u2019s most valuable public company. But it foundered in several key industrial markets in recent years, and a diversion into financial services steered it into the eye of the global financial crisis in 2008.  It now ranks as the sixth smallest member of the Dow by market value and carries the index\u2019s lowest stock price, making it the least influential component of the price-weighted average.  Faced with weak profits and calls to be broken up, the 126-year-old company is aggressively cutting costs, selling businesses and trying to strengthen its balance sheet under new managers and a new board.  Its stock has fallen nearly 80 percent from highs in 2000. Last month, Chief Executive John Flannery warned that GE may not be able to pay its 2019 dividend.  \u201cIt was at one time perhaps one of the quintessential U.S. companies, and like others that have been taken out of the Dow, it\u2019s a reflection that they\u2019re no longer seen in that light,\u201d said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  WALGREENS HELPS REFLECT U.S. ECONOMY  The shifting sands of the Dow are testament to the various companies that were unassailable household names for decades before becoming the victims of an evolving economy. Some simply disappeared, while others found new life even if they did not reclaim their prior economic influence. They include Eastman Kodak, Sears Roebuck, International Paper, Goodyear, Bethlehem Steel, Westinghouse, General Motors Co GM.N and Chrysler.  Co-founded by inventor Thomas Edison, GE was the largest U.S. company by stock market value starting in 1993, with brief interruptions from Microsoft Inc MSFT.O until Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N overtook it in 2005.  With the addition of Walgreens, the Dow will better reflect the role of consumers and healthcare in the U.S. economy, S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a statement.  While analysts had anticipated GE\u2019s exit from the Dow because of its falling share price, it is a blow to the company to lose its status as the only original member of the iconic index. GE did leave the Dow after the index was founded in 1896 but rejoined in 1907 and has been a constant member since then, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.  In a statement, GE said: \u201cWe are focused on executing against the plan we\u2019ve laid out to improve GE\u2019s performance. Today\u2019s announcement does nothing to change those commitments or our focus in creating in a stronger, simpler GE.\u201d  Some index watchers had expected GE\u2019s troubles to lead to its removal from the elite index.  Not all companies that have lost their place in the Dow have gone to their graves. Bank of America Corp BAC.N has outperformed the Dow by 46 percentage points since it was removed in 2013.  GE had fallen on hard times even as former Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt sought to jettison ailing businesses and focus on the company\u2019s industrial roots in power plants, jet engines, locomotives and other large equipment. Its industrial software business did not perform as expected, forcing GE to scale in its ambitions last year.  Immelt also built up GE\u2019s exposure to manufacturing and servicing coal and gas-fired electricity plants, only to see demand for such plants fall dramatically in recent years as sales of suddenly cost-competitive renewable wind and solar systems increased.  Aiming to generate cash and restore profitability, CEO John Flannery, who took over from Immelt last August, is exiting $20 billion in additional GE assets, including the locomotive business and a unit that makes small power-plant engines.  Changes to the Dow are made on an as-needed basis and selection is not governed by quantitative rules, according to published methodology for the index.","175":"March 20 (Reuters) - General Electric Co\u2019s transportation unit said on Tuesday several North American railroads have placed orders this year for 225 refurbished locomotives, although it declined to say which railroads ordered the equipment.  GE also said in a statement that it will deliver 80 modernized locomotives previously ordered by Canadian Pacific railway Co and 100 to Norfolk Southern Corp in 2018.  The orders were the latest evidence of major railroads seeking to control costs by refurbishing aging machinery instead of purchasing new engines.  GE will make varying upgrades to aging locomotives - some more than 20 years old - such as improvements to control systems or electrical circuitry. The changes boost hauling capacity but are cheaper than buying new, it said.  \u201cModernizations will most likely be a strong portion of our locomotive capital spending for a number of years,\u201d Doug Corbin, an assistant vice president at Norfolk Southern, said in a statement accompanying GE\u2019s announcement.

The investigation was opened following a legal complaint by ecologist lawmaker Delphine Batho, a judicial source said.  Batho told Reuters that as part of her work as a lawmaker in 2016, she had stumbled across 70 million euros in French state aid for GE to buy four turbines for an Iraqi power station for a contract awarded in the first quarter of that year.  She said Bailey was in charge of allocating the aid at the time, but was hired a year later by GE in a public relations role. Under French law, she said, he had not adhered to a three-year legal requirement for civil servants to wait before they join a company they have conducted business with previously.  Bailey started working at GE in France in November 2017, before stepping up to the role of general manager in April. He had previously worked as an adviser to Macron when he was the country\u2019s economy minister between 2014 and 2016.  \u201cIt\u2019s the least the prosecutors can do, because it\u2019s serious,\u201d Batho, a former environment minister, said.  Prosecutors did not immediately give details of the allegations against Bailey.  Under French law, a suspect is not formally charged with a crime unless he is sent to trial.

There\u2019s a story about me he included in his book. He called me up into his office. I was a lower mid-level finance employee, and he let me have it in the meeting for something the finance organization had done. He was everything everyone said about him in terms of how angry he could get. I walked out of there, calling my wife saying \u2018I think I\u2019ve been fired.\u2019 Two months later, I had worked on the RCA deal. (Then) he had me interviewing three to four levels higher than where I was. That was the kind of career accelerant he was.\u201d  \u201cHis constant focus on performance and recognizing that you have to deliver. It\u2019s something that very much carried over into Honeywell. Everyone can talk about it, few can do it, and he did it.\u201d  TOM NEFF, chairman of executive recruiting firm Spencer Stuart U.S.  \u201c(GE) was a hunting ground. I recruited, maybe five or six executives with a GE background who became CEOs for major companies.

As part of the move to GE, Vineyard Wind said on Tuesday it temporarily withdrew its plan from further review by the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to allow the project team to conduct a final review.  Vineyard Wind said that review will likely take several weeks, allowing it to reach the financial close in the second half of 2021 and begin delivering power in 2023.  ClearView said the decision to switch suppliers could delay a BOEM decision until President-elect Joe Biden takes office, which \u201cmay lessen what the industry may view as incremental risk of a permit denial\u201d from Donald Trump\u2019s administration.  \u201cWe continue to think the offshore wind industry is likely to view the Biden Administration more as a \u2018partner\u2019 instead of as an obstacle,\u201d ClearView said.

GE Renewable Energy will develop and manufacture the new turbine largely in France and aims to supply its first nacelle, - or power generating unit - for demonstration in 2019 and ship the first turbines in 2021.  The firm will invest close to $100 million in a new blade manufacturing plant in Cherbourg, western France, which will open in 2018. It will also invest close to $60 million over the next five years to modernize its Saint-Nazaire factory, where the nacelles for the Haliade-X will be built.  GE, already a major global player in onshore wind, entered the offshore wind turbine market through its takeover of France\u2019s Alstom in 2015.  GE said the new turbine - which will have a direct-drive power generator rather than a gearbox - will be 30 percent bigger than its nearest competitors.  In June 2017, MHI Vestas, a joint venture between Vestas and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, launched a 9.5 MW offshore turbine, currently the world\u2019s most powerful wind turbine.  Standing 187 meters tall and with 80-metre blades, it is an upgrade of MHI Vestas\u2019 8 MW V164 turbine, which is already in operation at the Burbo Bank Extension and Blyth offshore wind farms in Britain.  MHI Vestas has also been named preferred supplier for Britain\u2019s Triton Knoll and Moray East offshore wind farms for a total of 190 of the 9.5 MW turbines.  An MHI Vestas spokesman declined to comment on future turbine development.  The size of offshore wind turbines - which unlike onshore turbines is not limited by overland truck transport - has grown rapidly in recent years as bigger turbines capture more wind and reduce maintenance costs and capital spending.

REUTERS\/Hannah McKay  (Reuters) - Vineyard Wind, which is developing the first major U.S. offshore wind farm, has temporarily withdrawn the project from the federal permitting process so the company can incorporate turbines from a new supplier, General Electric Co, in its design.  The move, which requires a technical review that will last several weeks, will almost certainly delay a federal decision over whether to approve the project until after President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.  Calling the decision to pause the permitting process \u201cdifficult,\u201d Vineyard Wind Chief Executive Lars Pedersen said in a statement issued on Tuesday that he hoped it would help avoid further delays.  The company still expects the project to begin delivering power in 2023. It is designed to generate enough electricity for more than 400,000 customers in Massachusetts.  Vineyard Wind has suffered a string of permitting delays since 2019 due to concerns that the project\u2019s wind turbines will harm fisheries and navigation.  Because of the switch to GE\u2019s higher-capacity Haliade-X technology, the project will use just 62 turbines instead of the 84 it had originally planned, according to spokesman Andrew Doba. Previously, Vineyard Wind proposed using Vestas Wind System A\/S\u2019 V164 turbines, but that contract expired earlier this year.  A spokesman for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which is overseeing the federal permitting process, said on Wednesday it had received and was reviewing Vineyard Wind\u2019s letter withdrawing its construction plan from consideration.  ClearView Energy Partners analysts said the pause reduced the risk of a permit denial by the outgoing Trump administration, and added that purchasing GE turbines could align with Biden\u2019s support for domestic trade unions.

FILE PHOTO - The ticker and logo for General Electric Co. is displayed on a screen at the post where it is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S. on June 30, 2016. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  The once-mighty GE had become the sixth-smallest member of the 30-component Dow by market value and carried the index\u2019s lowest stock price.  The move by S&P Dow Jones Indices reflected the decline of an American industrial icon. But the company\u2019s plunging stock highlights a problem that refuses to go away: too much concentration of employer stock in workplace retirement plans.  More than one-third of GE 401(k) plan assets were held in the company\u2019s own shares in 2016, federal filings show.  Just 15 years ago, GE was the world\u2019s most valuable public company. But it has struggled in several of its key industrial markets and suffered losses in the financial services business during the global financial meltdown of 2008.  GE stock has fallen nearly 80 percent from highs in 2000, serving up a reminder of the risk of holding your employer\u2019s stock in a retirement account.  Changes in federal law have encouraged retirement plans to move away from company stock ownership, and a spate of lawsuits also have helped convince many plan sponsors to reduce or eliminate the practice.  Data from Vanguard points to an encouraging trend. In 2017, among all account-holders in defined contribution plans administered by the mutual fund giant, 90 percent had no investments in their employer\u2019s shares, either because it was not offered (76 percent) or they chose not to invest in it (14 percent). Five percent had holdings ranging from 1 percent to 20 percent of their plan assets, and 5 percent had concentrated employee stock positions exceeding 20 percent. The industries still most likely to offer company stock were agriculture\/mining and construction (13 percent offered), Vanguard data shows.  THE ENRON EFFECT  The GE story belies a sharp improvement in diversification by many 401(k) plans over the past decade. As recently as 2007, nearly 25 percent of Vanguard-administered plans had employer stock concentration levels higher than 20 percent.  The more recent improvement stems in part from the spectacular 2001 collapse of Enron Corp, which blew away the life savings of thousands of employees holding the company\u2019s stock. The ensuing Pension Protection Act of 2006 required defined contribution plan sponsors to allow participants to diversify holdings away from employer shares, and to notify them of their rights in this area.  Most experts say employee retirement portfolios should not hold more than 10 or 15 percent of their employer\u2019s stock.  \"Since Enron, many employers have decided this isn\u2019t a good thing for employees - that\u2019s the good news,\u201d said Robert Pozen, a senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management, who recently reviewed federal filings of large retirement plans. (brook.gs\/2m5dwUv)  \u201cUnfortunately, quite a few companies have continued to not only allow this but essentially encourage it, because they make matching contributions with their own stock as a way to conserve cash,\u201d he said. (GE employees are not required to take matching contributions in company stock, a GE spokeswoman said.)  Pozen has no problem with employee stock ownership outside a retirement plan, or stock options. But most employees should hold broadly diversified retirement portfolios, he said. Morningstar research has found that the stock of companies with high allocations of their own stock in a 401(k) plan tended to underperform their peers on a relative performance and risk-adjusted basis.  Moreover, Vanguard research shows that concentrated stock positions tend to displace investments in diversified equity funds and other balanced funds. Overall equity allocations also tend to be higher.  Another problem is exposing workers to the double risk of potentially losing not only their savings but their jobs. And the GE story underscores the false sense of comfort that can arise among employee investors.  \u201cCompanies like GE have done very well over many decades, but there are very few that do really well over 30 or 40 years,\u201d Pozen said.  I asked GE if it has policies or programs in place encouraging diversification. Mary Kate Nevin, manager of financial and executive communications, pointed to language in an employee benefits handbook warning against the risk of having any more than 20 percent of retirement savings in any single company stock, or industry. She also noted that the 401(k) program held more than 250 education sessions with workers last year that also included messages about the importance of diversification.  Pozen thinks more will be required. He argues U.S. Congress should take steps to reduce or eliminate this risk by limiting holdings of employer stock to 10 percent of plan assets - the same legal limit that defined benefit plans must follow in their investment portfolios.  \u201cYou could grandfather existing programs, and tell them that they can no longer increase the percentage of their own stock in the plan,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a dramatic thing, and it would be very positive for plan participants.\u201d","198":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - General Electric Co has too much debt and needs to reduce it \u201cthoughtfully and soon\u201d, Chief Executive Officer Lawrence Culp said in a letter to shareholders on Tuesday.

Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp said Markopolos\u2019 175-page report contained factual errors and constituted \u201cmarket manipulation - pure and simple,\u201d because Markopolos stood to profit from short-selling tied to its release.  Short sales, or bets that a share price will fall, have risen 17% in GE stock over the past month to 110 million shares worth about $995 million before the report came out Thursday, said Matthew Unterman, a director at S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm in New York.  In the report www.gefraud.com, Markopolos accused GE of hiding $38 billion in potential losses and asserted that the company's cash and debt positions were far worse than it had disclosed.  \u201cGE\u2019s true debt to equity ratio is 17:1, not 3:1, which will undermine its credit status,\u201d Markopolos said.  The report also says GE is insolvent and asserts that its industrial units have a working capital deficit of $20 billion.  \u201cHe is selectively front-running widely reported regulatory processes and rigorous investigations without the benefit of any access to GE\u2019s books and records,\u201d GE board member and audit committee chair Leslie Seidman said in a statement, referring to Markopolos.  While investors sent GE shares sharply lower, the report echoes the assertions of some of Wall Street\u2019s more skeptical analysts, who have long raised alarms about GE\u2019s low cash flow, frequent accounting charges and writedowns, and what they describe as opaque financial reports.  Culp, the first outside leader of the company who took over in October, has made no secret of its woes.  The industrial businesses have seen a $2.2 billion cash outflow so far this year, and Culp said last month that GE may incur cash costs of $1.4 billion this year from the grounding of Boeing Co's BA.N 737 MAX jetliner. GE makes engines for the jet through a joint venture with Safran SA SAF.PA of France.  The report alleges that GE faces $38 billion in future expenses that it has not disclosed. \u201cGE\u2019s $38 billion in accounting fraud amounts to over 40% of GE\u2019s market capitalization, making it far more serious than either the Enron or WorldCom accounting frauds,\u201d the report says.

REUTERS\/Alwyn Scott  In a statement GE said, \u201cWe remain focused on running our business every day and ... will not be distracted by this type of meritless, misguided and self-serving speculation.\u201d  GE said it \u201cstands behind its financials\u201d and operates to the \u201chighest-level of integrity\u201d in its financial reporting.  It also said Markopolos was known to work for unnamed hedge funds that typically benefit from short-selling a company\u2019s stock.  BACKED BY A HEDGE FUND  A disclaimer in the report stated that it was drafted by Forensic Decisions PR LLC, which will get compensation from a third-party entity that could benefit from a decline in GE\u2019s share price. The report did not name the entity.  Speaking on CNBC on Thursday, Markopolos said he would receive a percentage of any profits generated by the report. He declined to provide details about the compensation or name the fund involved, which he said was \u201ca mid-sized U.S. hedge fund.\u201d  GE shares closed down 11.3% at $8.01 on Thursday, its biggest one-day percentage drop since April 2008.  A regulatory filing showed CEO Culp bought GE shares worth nearly $2 million in open market purchase at an average price of $7.93 per share. (bit.ly\/2z39HFL)  In the past two years, GE has announced more than $40 billion in asset writedowns and accounting charges. The company also has said its accounting is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice.  The report details GE\u2019s exposure to long-term care insurance, the subject of a federal class-action lawsuit awaiting a decision on GE\u2019s motion to dismiss.  It says GE\u2019s financial statements about its insurance business do not correspond to those of eight insurers that Markopolos says hold about 95% of GE\u2019s exposure.  Markopolos is best known for alerting regulators in the early 2000s to signs that money manager Madoff\u2019s investment firm was a Ponzi scheme, a deception in which unusually high returns for early investors are generated with money from later investors. Madoff was arrested in 2008 and later sentenced to 150 years in prison.  John Hempton, co-founder of the Sydney, Australia-based Bronte Capital hedge fund, wrote in a blog post here on Thursday that GE's 14.7% average profit margin in recent years was in line with the returns of its industrial peers, not \"too good to be true\" as Markopolos alleges.  \u201cGE remains the unequivocal leader\u201d in medical imaging and jet engines and its currently depressed profit margin will likely rebound, he wrote, adding, \u201cHarry\u2019s report is silly. The market should ignore it.\u201d  Worried investors jangled phones on Wall Street Thursday. Nick Heymann, an analyst at William Baird & Co, said questions focused on $18.5 billion of the $38 billion in charges that Markopolos says GE is concealing.  Markopolos said GE will need to set aside that money to cover its long-term care policies in addition to the $15 billion it has already begun to set aside.  Heymann said the remainder of the $38 billion was already largely known: charges related to an accounting rule change coming in 2021 and potential losses on GE\u2019s 50.4% stake in subsidiary Baker Hughes, which it plans to sell.  \u201cI don\u2019t know the validity of the $18.5 billion,\u201d Heymann said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure it out.\u201d  But he said if the figure was accurate, Culp would not have recently raised GE\u2019s 2019 financial targets.","200":"(Reuters) - Baker Hughes, General Electric Co\u2019s oilfield services arm, on Friday reported a slight profit miss on weaker revenues in its oilfield equipment and turbomachinery businesses, but delivered an upbeat outlook for the second half of the year.

Revenue in oilfield services, which accounts for more than one-half of overall sales, gained 14 percent year over year to approximately $2.9 billion, driven by stronger activity in North America. Higher oil prices have prompted a surge in drilling activity.  U.S. oil production hit a record 11 million barrels per day last week, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Analysts for investment firm Tudor Pickering Holt & Co called the results \u201cnot particularly sexy\u201d or a big stock mover.

The stock, an original component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, was replaced in the blue-chip index last year.  The dramatic plunge has lured investors who see worth in GE\u2019s jet-engine, healthcare equipment and power turbine businesses and are confident in new CEO Larry Culp, as shareholders seek to capitalize on the stock\u2019s steep slide.  \u201cBased on what we believed the business is worth, it is one of the best investment returns, even on a risk-adjusted basis, that we can find in the large-cap space,\u201d said Gary Lenhoff, chief investment officer at Great Lakes Advisors in Chicago, which Lenhoff said was buying GE shares in the second half of last year and said his timeline was three years.  Even those with long-term investment horizons will keenly watch fourth-quarter results on Thursday. GE is trying to restore profitability at the power division, which manufactures and services turbines. The unit is expected to realize virtually no earnings this year, according to analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.  \u201cThe actions that need to be taken in the power business \u2013 it\u2019s not a quick fix, it\u2019s not something that you can achieve in six months,\u201d said Michael Kon, portfolio manager with Golub Group in San Mateo, California. \u201cUsually a turnaround of that magnitude takes a year or two to be complete and you can then start seeing the fruit of it.\u201d  Investors will also watch GE\u2019s moves to shore up the balance sheet and reduce debt, including updates on planned asset sales. They hope GE, which booked billions of dollars in charges last year, can avoid negative surprises.  Daniel Babkes, senior research analyst at Pzena Investment Management, said GE\u2019s stock price already accounts for some potential negative news, including prolonged struggles for the power business and dour assumptions for liabilities.  Pzena bought GE shares last year, the first time in the value investment firm\u2019s more than 20-year history that it has made a significant investment in the company\u2019s stock.  \u201cWe are in this period of peak uncertainty,\u201d Babkes said. \u201cWhat is particularly attractive about the investment is not just the fact that the path forward can look better, it\u2019s that none of that is priced in.\u201d  Graphic: Long road lower for GE shares - tmsnrt.rs\/2Bar3SD  Several investors expressed enthusiasm for Culp, named GE\u2019s chief executive officer on Oct 1 with a compensation package linked to stock price performance.

GE is saddled with heavy debt, and income-driven investors have likely been chased away after Culp slashed GE\u2019s quarterly dividend to a penny a share to preserve cash.  There are serious concerns about the GE Capital lending arm and the power division. GE posted a third-quarter loss of $22.8 billion, including a massive writedown of goodwill from the power business, mainly from its 2015 acquisition of assets from Alstom.  Granite Investment Advisors plans to play the long game, buying GE shares again after selling some at the end of 2018 for tax purposes, said Scott Schermerhorn, chief investment officer.

GE shares fell 4 percent after EDF said it took the action over the weekend following a failure of a turbine blade at Exelon Corp\u2019s Colorado Bend plant in Texas. GE and Exelon said last week that four such turbines in Texas were halted when one of them had a blade failure.  \u201cThe (Bouchain) plant will be closed until Oct. 22 to proceed with controls and maintenance as advised by GE,\u201d an EDF spokeswoman told Reuters.

The Boston-based conglomerate said the problem could potentially affect all 70 of its 9FB turbines it has installed, and all the 51 HA turbines it has shipped.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The U.S. government intervened in favor of GE and put pressure on the Baghdad government, the FT said, citing people familiar with the matter.  Although no decision has been made, Siemens had been the favorite to win the contract to supply 11 gigawatts of power generation equipment to Iraq in a deal reported to be worth around $15 billion.  But the Trump administration reminded the Iraqi government that 7,000 U.S. personnel had died since the 2003 invasion which overthrew Saddam Hussein, the people said.  GE, which has been battling a severe downturn in its power division, is now expected to take a substantial part of the sale, which could be included in its figures when it reports its third-quarter earnings on Oct. 30.  GE was not immediately available for comment.  Siemens has not given up hope of gaining a slice of the contract.  \u201cOur discussions with the government are continuing and we look forward to entering an official agreement to provide affordable, reliable and sustainable energy for Iraq,\u201d a Siemens spokesman said.  Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser had traveled to Iraq in September and spoke with outgoing Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi about the contract.  Since then Abadi has been replaced by Adel Abdul-Mahdi. Meanwhile U.S. pressure in favor of GE has intensified, the report said.  In February Siemens made an offer to build new power plants in Iraq over four years with an output of 11 gigawatts. Such an increase in energy production would increase the number of Iraqis who have access to reliable electricity by 50 percent to 23 million.

Chief Executive Larry Culp declined to be drawn in on when cash flow might recover, and said some of the $2 billion in cost cutting the company was undertaking to deal with the economic effect of the coronavirus could be permanent.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been hit hard and fast ... in some of our most important, highest-margin businesses, be it aviation, and services, particularly, gas power services,\u201d Culp said on a conference call. \u201cWe think that that gets worse before it gets better, particularly here in the second quarter.\u201d  The one comparative bright spot was GE\u2019s healthcare business, where demand for coronavirus-related products rose 1.5 to 2 fold, he said. This was partly offset by declining demand for other products. The division, which recently sold its biopharma unit, generated $896 million in quarterly profit.

Free cash flow from industrial operations was negative $2.2 billion in the first quarter, missing analysts\u2019 estimates of negative $2.02 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  GE reported adjusted earnings of 5 cents per share, below the average estimate of 8 cents, according to Refinitiv.  Fallout from the pandemic caused revenue to fall 13% in both the aviation and power divisions. Profit in aviation fell 39% to $1 billion, while the power unit lost $129 million, GE said.  Revenue at GE\u2019s gas power business fell by $426 million on an organic, or comparable basis from a year ago, more than the $387 million decline in such revenue in the aviation unit.  GE said about 20% of planned maintenance work on power plants had been deferred until later in the year, a factor that weighed on revenue and profit. Many U.S. utilities are deferring non-essential work because of health and safety restrictions.  GE said it planned to cut costs by $2 billion and take other steps to save $3 billion in cash in response to the pandemic, such as reducing capital spending or adjusting working capital.  The company had already announced this month plans to furlough half of its U.S. aviation component manufacturing and jet-engine assembly workers, without specifying how many.

GE said it has $7.8 billion in industrial debt maturing between 2020 and 20204.  GE also said GE Capital had paid off $4.7 billion of debt that matured in the first quarter of 2020, and that GE had repaid $6 billion in intercompany loans to GE Capital, using proceeds from the recent sale of its biopharma business.  The company\u2019s total borrowings stood at $90.9 billion as of Dec. 31.  GE\u2019s shares were down about 5% at $6.78 on Monday.  The U.S. industrial conglomerate last week pulled its full-year forecast due to the uncertainties created by the coronavirus outbreak, but backed its first-quarter industrial free cash flow expectation of an outflow of nearly $2 billion.  The maker of jet engines, power plants and other industrial equipment last month sold its biopharma business to Danaher Corp DHR.N, netting about $20 billion in cash.  GE said it held cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of more than $47 billion as of March 31.

REUTERS\/Alwyn Scott  Boston-based GE, which makes 737 MAX engines in a joint venture, also said Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller, who was appointed in October 2017, plans to step down after a successor is hired. The company which also makes power plants and medical devices did not specify a time frame.  GE appeared to cheer investors by saying it might generate as much as $1 billion in free cash flow this year, compared with a potential outflow of $2 billion that it forecast in May. GE also raised its profit outlook by 5 cents a share.  \u201cThere should be some relief from the raised EPS and free cash flow\u201d forecast, Barclays analyst Julian Mitchell said.  But GE\u2019s portfolio of low-margin industrial businesses remains a concern. GE posted red ink again after two profitable quarters, due mainly to a $744-million goodwill charge for its power grid business. GE spent less on restructuring than analysts expected, which underpinned its performance.  GE also received a tax benefit worth 6 cents a share that more than accounted for its increased profit forecast.  \u201cThe EPS increase of 5 cents ... is less than this quarter\u2019s 6-cent tax benefit,\u201d Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch said in a note. The cash flow increase \u201cappears to be heavily driven by ... reduced cash restructuring drag,\u201d he added.  After surging 4% in premarket trading, GE shares fell less than 1% to $10.45.  Graphic: GE shares under CEO Culp - tmsnrt.rs\/2yqnVjR  GE\u2019s industrial businesses suffered another tough three months, with margins falling by as much as 8 percentage points at renewable energy. But they generated more cash than expected, in part because it has become more aggressive in billing customers, collecting payments and reducing inventory, Chief Executive Larry Culp said on a conference call.  GE\u2019s power business, which has long been a drag on earnings, posted a $117-million profit. But its relatively strong aviation business suffered as problems stretched on with Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX jetliner, which regulators grounded in March.  CFM International, a joint venture between GE and France's Safran SA SAF.PA, supplies engines for the 737 MAX.  The MAX could cost GE $1.4 billion in cash if the plane remains grounded all year, as now appears possible, GE said.  \u201cThat was not in the previous guidance,\u201d said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray, who added that investors reacted by selling GE after the conference call.  But airlines will fly older planes in place of the MAX and those use more spare parts, a lucrative product line for GE, Dray said. \u201cWe have to believe GE has ample contingency in their free cash flow outlook to have taken a bold, unexpected step to increase guidance,\u201d Dray said. \u201cNo one was expecting them to.\u201d  Investors have watched GE\u2019s cash generation as it has failed to keep pace with earnings in recent years, raising concerns that GE\u2019s actual financial performance was falling short of stated results. But in May Culp said he would focus on generating cash and let earnings be \u201calmost like a byproduct,\u201d Dray said.  GE said it now expects higher industrial revenue growth and bumped up earnings per share by 5 cents to between 55 cents and 65 cents. It shifted its forecast for industrial free cash flow to between negative $1 billion and positive $1 billion, from $0 to negative $2 billion.  Loss per share from continuing operations was 3 cents, down from a profit of 8 cents a year ago. On an adjusted basis, GE earned 17 cents per share, including the tax gain, compared with analysts estimates of 12 cents, on average, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue fell 1.1% to $28.8 billion.","223":"SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co\u2019s effort to build the world\u2019s largest twin-engined jet, the 777X, continues to be hampered by challenges with General Electric Co\u2019s new GE9X turbine engine, a top Boeing executive said on Wednesday.  FILE PHOTO: The Boeing logo is pictured at the Latin American Business Aviation Conference & Exhibition fair (LABACE) at Congonhas Airport in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Aug. 14, 2018. REUTERS\/Paulo Whitaker  Boeing is facing testing glitches on the GE9X after assembly delays on the engine and the plane\u2019s carbon-composite wings. These issues, coupled with the crisis over its 737 MAX in the wake of deadly crashes, leaves the world\u2019s largest planemaker less leeway to deliver on its official 2020 target for entry into service, industry sources say.  Dubai\u2019s Emirates has said it expects to fly its first 777X in June 2020, a date now widely seen in doubt.  Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told a conference that 2020 entry into service was \u201cstill the current assumption,\u201d echoing comments from Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg last week.  \u201c(The) long pole in the tent right now is the GE engine,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThere\u2019s some challenges they are working through there on testing. So we are having to do some re-testing, and they\u2019re working their way through that.\u201d  The market for widebody jets has been fragile due to oversupply and fears over the economy and trade disputes. Reuters reported in March that a major potential deal for more than 100 Boeing jetliners of various types with China was in doubt in the wake of the trade dispute and the MAX crisis.  The first two 777X flight test aircraft have left Boeing\u2019s Seattle-area factory and are in integrated system testing on the ground, while the next two flight test airplanes are in final assembly, Muilenburg said.  But the engine snags and other issues have diminished the prospect of a maiden flight in late June, despite a prediction over the weekend by the head of Gulf airline Emirates for a \u202aJune 26 flight.  One airline source familiar with the program said the flight test schedule had originally been set at 14 months, but heightened scrutiny over aircraft certification after two 737 MAX crashes in October and March means that schedule is unlikely to be accelerated.  That means the 777X is more likely to be handed over to airlines toward the end of 2020, and that date could slip into 2021, airline sources said at an industry gathering in Seoul this week.  GE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  GE began flight trials of the turbine engine, the world\u2019s largest, in March after a three-month delay caused mainly by a problem in its compressor.

REUTERS\/Vincent Kessler\/File Photo  But GE faces rising competition, complicating new Chief Executive Larry Culp\u2019s efforts to turn around the company\u2019s ailing power unit.  GE booked six orders for its advanced, HA-class turbines in the quarter, up from none a year ago, according to three people familiar with the situation and an industry report seen by Reuters on Tuesday. Rival Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems (MHPS) booked five orders, while Siemens AG booked four, the sources said.  For a graphic, see: tmsnrt.rs\/2LyarvN  The standings highlight an intensifying battle for sales of these newest, most efficient \u201cadvanced class\u201d generators capable of powering thousands of homes.  Demand for gas turbines has fallen by half since 2014 as utilities rely more on wind, solar and power conservation. GE\u2019s share is shrinking. It ranked second for advanced turbine orders in 2018 and is shutting manufacturing sites and laying off workers to reduce costs.  GE confirmed to Reuters it had booked three additional orders in the first quarter that were not counted in its first-quarter earnings report. The three additional units, sold to Tokyo Electric Power Co in Japan, were included in the closely watched McCoy Power Report published on Tuesday. McCoy declined to comment.  Siemens and MHPS also confirmed their tallies with Reuters.  GE has dominated power-plant sales for decades and has installed more than 7,500 gas turbines around the globe. But its position has weakened. Its backlog of power equipment orders is down 1.5% from a year ago, and GE faced pressure after an HA turbine broke at a plant in Texas last year, forcing GE to replace blades in dozens of plants.  Power was once GE\u2019s largest unit, but it has been a drag on the company\u2019s earnings. GE lost $22.8 billion last year due to a $22 billion write-down of power assets and an $872 million operating loss in its power unit.  GE Power posted an $80 million profit in the first quarter of this year, after Culp restructured the unit in October to separate gas power from other types of power.  Culp warned at GE\u2019s annual meeting last Wednesday that the relatively strong first-quarter performance was not a trend, and remaining quarters would likely be weaker.  Siemens, meanwhile, said this week that it will spin off its oil and gas, power-plant and grid businesses along with its 59% stake in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy to allow them to grow without competing for capital with higher-margin Siemens businesses. It plans to list the new company publicly by September 2020.","225":"April 21 (Reuters) - General Electric Co:  * GE - GE ANNOUNCES EXPIRATION AND RESULTS OF ITS DEBT TENDER OFFERS  * GE - OFFERS EXPIRED AT 5:00 P.M.

FILE PHOTO: A trader walks next to Siemens Energy AG logos during Siemens Energy's initial public offering (IPO) at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, September 28, 2020. REUTERS\/Ralph Orlowski\/File Photo  GE sued the rival company, Siemens Energy Inc, in a U.S. district court in Virginia, alleging the theft traces back to May 2019, when the industrial conglomerates bid to provide gas turbine equipment and servicing to Dominion Energy Inc. Dominion is a Virginia power utility that provides electricity to about 4 million customers on the east coast.  The suit comes in the wake of Siemens AG spinning off its energy business to create Siemens Energy. GE alleges that Siemens Energy used trade secrets improperly received from a Dominion employee in part to win contracts that would boost the price of its separate listing that took place in September.  Siemens identified the receipt of GE\u2019s trade secrets \u201cthrough its own robust compliance processes,\u201d a spokesman said. Following an internal investigation, Siemens \u201cimplemented extensive remedial measures in response,\u201d the spokesman added, such as \u201cswift and appropriate discipline of the involved employees, including separation from the company.\u201d  A Dominion representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  \u201cThis story is a negative for sentiment on Siemens Energy, which has recently been among the sector\u2019s best performers,\u201d Citi analysts said in a note.  Shares in Siemens Energy were down 6.5%.  In the course of GE\u2019s bid for business with Dominion, the lawsuit alleges, a senior Dominion employee started sending to a Siemens account manager confidential business information GE had submitted. The information also included Dominion\u2019s analysis of all bids, giving Siemens a \u201cblueprint\u201d to win contracts worth up to $340 million with the utility for the business, known as the Peakers Project, GE alleged.  The recipient of GE\u2019s trade secrets at Siemens passed the information to colleagues that included those preparing the Dominion bid, which they used to help win the business, the lawsuit said.  The Dominion employee, no longer employed there, passed the information to the Siemens manager at least half a dozen times, in some instances forwarding it from his personal email address to that of the Siemens manager\u2019s wife, the lawsuit said. The employee on the receiving end remains at Siemens, the lawsuit said.  In a bid package, GE had provided Dominion with technical specifications for four gas turbine models, pricing for different combinations of the equipment and details on how the company would service and maintain it, the lawsuit claims. Gas turbines are combustion engines that convert natural gas to energy powering generators that supply electricity to large residential and business developments.  Siemens only alerted GE to improperly receiving the trade secrets 16 months later, in September, through what GE described as a \u201cnothing to see here, folks\u201d letter minimizing the infraction, the lawsuit alleged.  The alert came after Siemens completed its own internal investigation and Dominion finished its own inquiry, the lawsuit claims. Dominion alerted GE to the alleged malfeasance before Siemens did, the lawsuit said. GE asked a judge to halt Siemens from using the allegedly stolen material and pay damages totaling hundreds of millions of dollars or more.  Siemens Energy, in its listing prospectus dated Sept. 7, 2020, said it had \u201cidentified a business area that received, during a bidding process, confidential competitor and customer information, which may have negative consequences for us.\u201d  A spokesman for Siemens Energy declined to comment on the identity of the competitor.  The litigation is the latest legal battle involving the corporate rivals, which have squared off in lawsuits over patent infringement as recently as last year.  The alleged theft has put GE at a disadvantage competing for upcoming contracts worth at least $120 million apiece, the lawsuit claims. GE and Siemens are competing on another Dominion bid due Jan. 19, adding urgency to resolving the theft allegations, the lawsuit said.  Since first improperly receiving the information in May 2019, Siemens has won eight other gas turbine bids over GE\u2019s competing proposals valued at more than $1 billion, the lawsuit alleges.  In most of those proposals, GE bid some of the same gas turbine models from the Dominion project, and in one case equipment with similar specifications, the lawsuit said.  According to GE, the Siemens employee receiving the trade secrets passed them to numerous colleagues, some of whom played key roles in preparing other gas turbine bids. GE lost the Dominion bid to Siemens in July 2019 without explanation, the lawsuit alleges, and Siemens employees continued to disseminate and use GE trade secrets to tailor at least two additional gas turbine proposals.  Siemens has also \u201csteadfastly refused\u201d to assure GE that documents containing the trade secrets have been destroyed, the lawsuit claims.  The Siemens spokesman said the company has removed GE\u2019s confidential information from all its internal systems and restricted employees who received the trade secrets from working on similar bids or proposals and reassigned employees to other parts of its business.","228":"ABUJA, Nov 15 (Reuters) - General Electric (GE) said on Thursday it has passed the leadership of a consortium picked to run a Nigerian rail concession to South Africa\u2019s Transnet after the U.S. firm exited its transport business.  Reporting by Chijioke Ohuocha; Editing by Adrian Croft Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","229":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - General Electric Co is poised to shine light into a sizable part of its financial black box, an area that governs how it estimates revenue from long-term contracts.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The 126-year-old, Boston-based industrial conglomerate is due to publish figures soon that analysts say should help explain why it receives less cash from earnings than the industry average. The company has indicated it may release the figures by the end of this month.  The increased disclosure stems from new accounting standards that require companies to reveal more about how they estimate revenue from such long-term contracts, known as contract assets.  Companies typically use the cost of providing services as a basis for revenue estimates, but the process can lead to over- or under-estimating the value of the contracts, experts say.  GE\u2019s contract asset tally has soared 70 percent to $28.8 billion in 2017, from $16.9 billion in 2014, most of it in its power and aviation units. The majority of the total reflects revenue GE has already booked but for which it has not billed customers, which creates the gap between profit and cash flow, according to GE\u2019s regulatory filings.  GE\u2019s accounting is under scrutiny after earnings swung to a loss last year and GE said its 2018 results would be at the low end of its forecasted range. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also is looking into GE\u2019s accounting for contract assets, raising investor concern. GE has said it is not overly concerned about the investigation.  GE said in February that it expects to take a $4.2 billion accounting charge as it switches to the new standard. Some analysts think the charge could be higher, since competitors of GE\u2019s power business say the company is signing long-term service contracts at low prices to win equipment sales.  \u201cThat\u2019s what the competitors have been grousing,\u201d Deane Dray, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said on Wednesday.  If the charge is close to what GE disclosed, it could bolster GE Chief Executive John Flannery\u2019s credibility, which has been dented by falling profit and a charge for old insurance policies revealed in January.  GE also is restating financial results for 2016 and 2017 so that 2018 results will be comparable. The company\u2019s financial situation has prompted talk that it might raise capital. Its shares rose on Tuesday after reports that billionaire investor Warren Buffett may buy a stake after selling last year.  GE declined to comment on the Buffett reports. It said it chose to restate prior earnings - a more exacting standard under the new rules - because it will allow investors to compare 2018 results with the prior years on the same basis. \u201cWe chose that approach because we believe that it is the most helpful to our investors,\u201d GE spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said.","230":"Feb 26 (Reuters) - General Electric Co is targeting dividend in line with peers and needs to reduce its debt \u201cthoughtfully and soon\u201d, Chief Executive Officer Lawrence Culp said in a letter to shareholders on Tuesday.

REUTERS\/Joshua Roberts\/File Photo  Welch, known as \u201cNeutron Jack\u201d for his aggressive cost-saving methods, faced criticism particularly after he retired from GE for his cavalier attitude about offshoring jobs and shutting down U.S. plants.  Here are some key quotes on Welch\u2019s legacy:  DONALD TRUMP, president of the United States  \u201cThere was no corporate leader like \u201cneutron\u201d Jack. He was my friend and supporter. We made wonderful deals together. He will never be forgotten. My warmest sympathies to his wonderful wife & family!\u201d  LAWRENCE CULP, CEO of GE  \u201cJack was larger than life and the heart of GE for half a century. He reshaped the face of our company and the business world. Jack was a strong and constant influence throughout my career despite never having worked directly for him.\u201d  \u201cWhen I last saw him, what I remember most vividly was when he asked me, \u2018So how exactly are you running the company?\u2019 Jack was still in it \u2013 committed to GE\u2019s success. And to have Jack Welch ask me how I am running GE is pretty humbling.\u201d  JAMIE DIMON, CEO of JPMorgan Chase  \u201cJack was an exceptional man and an outstanding leader who had such enormous impact on the role of business in our country.\u201d  \u201cWith indefatigable spirit and sound judgment, he led GE through good times and difficult times. And all the while, he stood tall and always did the right thing for his company and his country.\u201d  \u201cPersonally, I always admired him as a mentor, as a friend, and even as a fatherly figure. He really set the standard as a CEO, not just in his performance running the company and as a legendary leader, but in his deep integrity, big heart and strategic vision.\u201d  DAVID COTE, executive chairman of Vertiv Holdings Co and former Honeywell International Inc CEO  \u201cHe was instrumental in the advancement of my career. There\u2019s a story about me he included in his book. He called me up into his office. I was a lower mid-level finance employee, and he let me have it in the meeting for something the finance organization had done. He was everything everyone said about him in terms of how angry he could get. I walked out of there, calling my wife saying \u2018I think I\u2019ve been fired.\u2019 Two months later, I had worked on the RCA deal. (Then) he had me interviewing three to four levels higher than where I was. That was the kind of career accelerant he was.\u201d  \u201cHis constant focus on performance and recognizing that you have to deliver. It\u2019s something that very much carried over into Honeywell. Everyone can talk about it, few can do it, and he did it.\u201d  TOM NEFF, chairman of executive recruiting firm Spencer Stuart U.S.  \u201c(GE) was a hunting ground. I recruited, maybe five or six executives with a GE background who became CEOs for major companies. (GE) was looked at as the preferred academy company for other businesses because of his leadership, his teaching approach to talent. You could screw up, but you needed performance over time. He was a risk taker, and he expected other executives to take risks.\u201d  STEVE MILLER, chairman of Purdue Pharma and former CEO of Delphi Corp  \u201cHe had the skill of identifying talent, and nurturing talent, and developing it, and those people have become business leaders elsewhere. The best single day example was the day Jeff Immelt was announced to succeed Jack Welch. The other three internal contenders were very strong, and instantly got other jobs.\u201d  \u201cThere are some leaders who destroy anyone who challenges their authority, (who say) you have to keep me on the job, there is no one else here who can do it. Jack was just the opposite, he developed incredibly strong talent around him. That\u2019s why GE for a long time was the best company around. For a very long time it was very hard to pry anyone away from GE.\u201d  TIM HUBBARD, assistant professor of management at the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Mendoza College of Business  \u201cHis aggressive, in-your-face style and edict to be number one or two in every major sector was embraced by both management consultants and business school faculty. Jack\u2019s aggressive style was matched by his growth-by-acquisition strategy which allowed GE to produce consistent double-digit growth in earnings per share. And, while his performance was tremendous, his exit was followed by arguably poor performance of future GE CEOs. The failure of subsequent CEOs underscores how important Welch\u2019s leadership was to GE.\u201d  THOMAS COOKE, professor at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business  \u201cWhen the book about business leaders in this century is written, Jack Welch will be near the very top. What he did as the leader of GE was remarkable.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to predict how things would have worked out if Jack stayed on deck, but certainly what happened to General Electric after he left is not a very positive story\u201d","233":"The 3M logo is seen at its global headquarters in Maplewood, Minnesota, U.S. on March 4, 2020.

The Fitch report, which the credit rating agency produces annually, echoed concerns raised last week by financial investigator Harry Markopolos, who estimated that GE has under-reserved by $29 billion for its long-term care policies. GE stepped up its defense of its insurance accounting on Monday.  Long-term care coverage, which pays for assisted living and nursing home stays, has turned out to be far more expensive than insurers assumed when they sold policies decades ago, and has tipped some insurers into financial loss and even bankruptcy.  Fitch said GE is not alone, and that many insurers still have not set aside enough money to cover losses expected on long-term care policies, which are unusually risky because the costs are volatile and vulnerable to interest rate changes. Even insurers that have taken a more conservative stance and set aside more money have not avoided losses, Fitch said.  But GE ranked second on Fitch\u2019s list of the 16 riskiest long-term care insurers, just below Genworth Financial Inc a company that GE spun out in 2004 and that holds former GE long-term care policies.  GE has below average reserves and \u201cvery high\u201d exposure to long-term care, Fitch Ratings analyst Anthony Beato told Reuters.  The other insurers cited as having below average reserves and very high exposure are Genworth, Unum Group and Senior Health Insurance Co of Pennsylvania.  GE scored high, Beato said, because it has mostly older policies written when the costs of long-term care were poorly understood. A large portion of GE\u2019s policies also provide lifetime benefits and some contain inflation protection benefits.  \u201cWhen you compound all of that together, (GE\u2019s portfolio) looks much riskier than what the rest of the industry maintains,\u201d Beato said.  GE\u2019s insurance group also has only about $1 billion in capital on a statutory accounting basis, Beato said. While GE, as the parent, has put in money to shore up reserves in the past, Fitch did not factor that into its rankings because it wanted a comparison of reported statutory capital levels across the industry, Beato said.  \u201cShould GE have to increase reserves further, the capital base continues to be dwarfed by this very large exposure\u201d at GE\u2019s insurance operating subsidiary, Beato said.

The Nigerian railway concession project was worth around $2 billion for two lines connecting northern cities to others in the south.  The government had been due to enter into negotiations last year with GE over a railway project, although Nigeria\u2019s upper house of parliament had said it would probe the railway concession over possible violations by Nigerian officials.  It was not clear why GE pulled out of the concession. The company was not immediately available for comment.  A consortium led by GE had submitted the only bid for the project in partnership with Transnet CGETR.UL of South Africa, Dutch-based APM Terminals and China's Sinohydro Consortium.  Fola Fagbule, senior vice president and head of advisory at Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), which ran the procurement process after being appointed lead adviser by the government, said Transnet was in discussion to replace GE.  Economic growth in Africa\u2019s most populous nation has been hampered for decades by its dilapidated rail network, built mainly by British colonial rulers before independence in 1960.

In Culp, GE is tapping a former head of another industrial company, Danaher Corp DHR.N. Culp led Danaher from 2000 to 2014, helping grow an industrial company into a broader conglomerate through a series of acquisitions, while growing earnings.  Danaher\u2019s stock soared over that time and prospered while GE\u2019s has struggled.  Flannery\u2019s departure comes as he was trying to turn around GE, including through a series of major planned divestitures from the sprawling company.  GE has continued to struggle, including with a recent issue with problems with turbines in its important power unit.  GE\u2019s share price suffered under Flannery, falling more than 50 percent since he took over last August. Under Immelt, GE\u2019s shares lost more than a third of their value.  GE\u2019s valuation, based on price-to-earnings ratios, also has declined, making the shares far cheaper than those of rival diversified industrial companies.

State-controlled Saudi Electricity Co 5110.SE has qualified at least two companies to provide service or parts for some of its more than 50 GE-made F-class turbines, and it is in talks with two others over investments to set up facilities to service the plants over many years, according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter. These approvals for the first time put Saudi Electricity in a position to break GE's hold on that work by having others bid against GE on maintaining the F-Class fleet - among the largest owned by a single entity and among the most lucrative service portfolios in the industry - when the existing contracts come up, according to the sources and industry databases. Saudi Electricity Co (SEC) has not yet offered any substantial F-Class contracts to new bidders, and it is unclear how soon it intends to seek bids, according to sources familiar with the matter. In response to questions from Reuters, GE said: \"At present, GE's F-class units in SEC continue to be covered under long-term service agreements.\" Saudi Electricity initially declined to comment.

REUTERS\/Stephane Mahe\/File Photo  In a joint statement to Reuters on Sunday after Reuters published, the companies stressed they have been partners on power generation for nearly 40 years. \u201cSEC has always embarked on a very balanced policy of procurement to ensure well diversified sources of suppliers,\u201d said Khalid Al-Tuaimi, executive vice president for generation of Saudi Electricity.  Saudi Electricity \u201calways qualifies multiple vendors to bid on services,\u201d Al-Tuaimi said, adding, \u201cWe have repeatedly found GE to be an excellent strategic partner for meeting our servicing needs.\u201d  Joseph Anis, President and CEO of GE Power Services, Africa, India and the Middle East, and Hisham Al Bahkali, President and CEO of GE Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, said: \u201cWe support more than half of the Kingdom\u2019s power supply, and are proud to be a part of the ongoing development of the sector.\u201d  Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest oil producer, has grown increasingly cost conscious, and under its \u201cVision 2030\u201d reform plan it aims to reduce oil dependence, lower state budget deficits and create jobs.  The kingdom also wants to obtain the best possible prices on large contracts with big companies, according to a source with direct knowledge of Saudi Electricity.  Saudi Electricity is in the process of getting other companies involved in bidding for power plant services, rather than relying on GE as the sole provider, because qualifying competitors will lower prices, the source said.  Saudi Electricity previously created competition for an earlier generation of turbines known as the E-class, according to the sources. After bidding began, GE ended up with less work and prices for the work fell by about 40 percent, sources said.  One source with knowledge of GE\u2019s service history in Saudi Arabia said some F-Class turbines that Saudi Electricity purchased more recently may not be under long-term agreements because the service price was high, and those could be opened for bidding at any time.  One side effect of Saudi Electricity qualifying third-party firms to repair its F-Class is that it is large enough to enable competitors to set up operations that they could use to sell the parts and repair services to customers outside Saudi Arabia, potentially threatening portions of GE\u2019s service business globally, three sources said.

Several dozen union workers from GE factories in Pennsylvania, Canada and elsewhere protested outside a GE facility here, where about 450 shareholders gathered for the meeting.  Inside GE\u2019s 125,000-square foot showroom for 3D printing machinery, shareholders called for ouster of directors who served on the board as GE\u2019s performance declined. One said GE should audit operations to look for questionable actions and claw back pension and other payments to former CEO Jeff Immelt.  \u201cIt should be clear by now that those performance-related payments should never have been made,\u201d the shareholder said.  Flannery said GE is \u201ckeenly aware of the pain\u201d caused by its poor performance and dividend cut last year. Executives are trying to turning around the ailing power and oil and gas businesses, he told shareholders, adding that there is evidence of \u201cgreen shoots\u201d of improvement.  The company faces six shareholder proposals, including a measure that would require the board chairman and chief executive roles to be held by separate persons. Another would require GE to exclude share buybacks when calculating whether the company met financial targets to qualify for executive bonuses. GE did not pay executive bonuses in 2017.  GE last week posted improved first-quarter earnings and affirmed its full-year earnings forecast, but warned its power business is still struggling and that the company will need time to restore the profitability it enjoyed three years ago. The company is shedding $20 billion in assets and still considering a possible break up.  \u201cIt\u2019s a back to basics story,\u201d Flannery said. \u201cWe just have to improve our performance.\u201d  Outside the building, union workers said they wanted to draw attention to GE\u2019s cuts to pension and healthcare benefits and to close facilities and lay off workers.

REUTERS\/Stephane Mahe\/File Photo  NEW YORK (Reuters) - General Electric Co booked the most orders for electricity-generating gas turbines in 2018 but fell to second place for the largest and most advanced machines, behind Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems, according to a closely watched report seen by Reuters and people familiar with the matter.  Demand for gas turbines has been tumbling since 2011, stoking fierce competition for deals and prompting manufacturers to slash jobs and close factories. GE is in the midst of a multi-year restructuring of its power business, which lost $808 million last year.  The latest rankings show Mitsubishi won 41 percent of the orders last year for turbines that can produce 100 megawatts or more, compared with 28 percent for GE and 25 percent for Siemens AG, according to McCoy Power Reports data.  Among newest-generation turbines, known as \u201cpost F-class,\u201d MHPS got 49 percent of orders, compared with 34 percent for GE and 16 percent for Siemens, the data shows.  Orders for the most advanced turbines have dwindled along with the entire market, even though they churn out the most electricity per unit of fuel burned. GE suffered a high-profile breakdown with one of its advanced turbines in Texas last year, and warned it may spend $480 million on repairs for the global fleet.  GE last year held onto its longtime top spot when all orders were counted.  The rankings show GE dominated orders for older-technology F-class turbines and that it had an overall tally of 33 percent of orders by capacity, compared with 31 percent for MHPS and 26 percent for Siemens.  GE is \u201cproud to the leader ... as it has been every year since 2010,\u201d spokeswoman Kirstin Carvell said. Siemens did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Mitsubishi said in a statement on Tuesday that its ranking largely reflected orders for its new J-Series turbine, which the company said has greater than 64 percent efficiency and 99.5 percent reliability.","253":"(Reuters) - General Electric Co GE.N said on Friday that turbine blade oxidation which forced Exelon Corp EXC.N to idle four electric power units in Texas also affects another model, widening the impact of the latest problem to hit GE's ailing power unit.

GE\u2019s message to dealmakers: Not so fast.  The company is wedded to a plan it outlined Tuesday to sell 20 percent of its healthcare unit and distribute the other 80 percent to shareholders through a tax-efficient spinoff, people familiar with management\u2019s thinking said.  Tax concerns make GE wary of entertaining other options for its healthcare business, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations.  A provision related to the majority stake GE owns in oil-services company Baker Hughes led to the plan it announced on Tuesday to gradually sell the stake down over 2-3 years, they said.  In an interview, GE Chief Executive Officer John Flannery would not rule out selling the healthcare unit or the Baker Hughes stake, but said the company intends to have them both trade publicly so GE shareholders can still benefit from future growth.  \u201cOur intention is to take it out as a stand-alone company,\u201d Flannery told Reuters when asked if a sale was a possibility. \u201cMy world view is there\u2019s no such thing as ruling out any option, but that\u2019s not our intention,  \u201cWe want to get these out into shareholders hands where they can grow more quickly.\u201d  GE\u2019s slow-and-steady divestiture plan tracks the approach it has taken under Flannery who took the helm last August.  For instance, when GE announced plans to sell its transportation business to Wabtec in an $11.1 billion last month, it kept a chunk of the business for itself and shareholders.  The company is open to smaller divestitures, and several are in process, including GE\u2019s lighting division, parts of its project finance unit Energy Financial Services, its aerospace parts group Middle River, and its offshore positioning systems unit Converteam.  Those transactions will only generate between $1 billion and $3 billion each, people familiar with the businesses said. Altogether, GE will probably generate another $5 billion or so in cash through more marginal deals.  The most problematic asset GE is trying to sell is its insurance business, which has incurred hefty charges, sparked shareholder lawsuits, and an investigation by U.S. regulators. Insurance liabilities stood at $38 billion at the end of 2017, according to GE\u2019s annual report, though it is unclear how such a deal would be structured or valued, bankers said.  TWO GEMS  There is already interest in GE\u2019s two gems \u2013 its healthcare unit and Baker Hughes \u2013 but each has complications preventing an outright sale.  In April, medical equipment maker Danaher Corp approached GE about potentially acquiring the life sciences division of its healthcare unit, a major source of sales that makes X-ray machines and hospital equipment, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The Wall Street Journal first reported Danaher\u2019s approach.  GE did not entertain talks at the time and remains unconvinced that any offer would be able to match how much the tax-efficient spinoff will earn for shareholders, the person said.  Another acquirer that could express interest in the healthcare unit is Thermo Fisher Scientific, according to a separate person familiar with the matter.  But GE plans to put roughly $18 billion of debt and pension obligations on the spinoff company, something that could dampen enthusiasm among potential buyers.  For Baker Hughes, instead of an outright sale, GE will likely either hold an initial public offering or organize numerous block trades of shares to institutional investors.  The company plans to stick to a lockup agreement it struck when acquiring the stake to remain a co-owner at least until 2019, the people said. Although the oil-services industry has come under pressure from falling commodity prices, GE sees potential in the business from cost cuts and growing customer relationships, they said.  Even if GE wanted to find a single buyer for the stake, it would be tough.  The only two strategic buyers, Schlumberger NV and Halliburton Co, would face major antitrust challenges, analysts said. Plus, there are few players out there with the resources to acquire the huge stake, worth $22 billion on Tuesday.

REUTERS\/Stephane Mahe\/File Photo  Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller, speaking to an investor conference organized by Citigroup in Miami, did not elaborate on the planned asset sales. The disposals could cut cash flow by less than $500 million in 2019, but would have no impact in 2018, she said.  GE has said it plans to sell its transportation unit, which makes railway locomotives; the iconic lighting division that makes bulbs for consumers, and a connections business that sells motors, generators and automation and electrical grid equipment.  Miller said GE does not plan to quickly sell its 62.5 percent stake in oilfield services business Baker Hughes BHGE.N before the expiration of a two-year lockup period, reversing an earlier stance that had cast uncertainty around Baker Hughes.

NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - General Electric Co shareholders offered their latest endorsement of new Chief Executive Larry Culp this week when they approved a 2018 pay package worth $15 million.  But perhaps the more notable endorsement of Culp\u2019s efforts to turn around the fortunes of the 127-year-old conglomerate has come from a more skeptical crowd: bondholders.  GE\u2019s 10 largest outstanding U.S. bonds are up an average of 11.73% in the new year, besting the ICE BAML index of bonds rated BBB, which has a total return 6.53% in that time. That\u2019s a stunning turn around for a basket of debt that had swooned so heavily last year that the bond market was rife with chatter that GE might lose its investment-grade credit rating.  Earnings on April 30 showed the Boston-based company still had a way to go in its turnaround efforts, but Culp\u2019s plan to reduce the company\u2019s $110 billion debt load has nevertheless spurred interest from bondholders.  The rise in bond prices is \u201cdefinitely a recognition of the fact (Culp) does have a plan and that maybe things have bottomed out for GE,\u201d said Mark Jackson, portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital.  \u201cThey have someone who recognizes that they need to delever and adjust cash flows and become a better operating company... Now there\u2019s someone in charge who has a plan to actually accomplish those two very pressing needs.\u201d  Culp was appointed last October just before GE was downgraded by credit rating agencies to just three notches above \u201cjunk\u201d status on the grounds that its debt load looked untenable as its earnings faltered. GE\u2019s share price has fallen by more than two-thirds since 2016 and last year it reported a $23 billion loss.  Since taking over, Culp has sold GE assets including its biopharma business to rival U.S. conglomerate Danaher Corp for $21.4 billion. Culp has also lowered expectations on earnings, saying Wednesday the company will likely have weaker quarters for the rest of the year after a surprisingly good start in the first quarter.  For now, the plan to delever may be enough.  \u201cWe started (buying the debt) when they announced the sale of their healthcare unit,\u201d said Monica Erickson, portfolio manager at DoubleLine Capital. \u201cThey\u2019re doing the right things, but it remains to be seen whether it all works out or not.\u201d  Jackson also said he had bought the debt recently at least in part because of Culp\u2019s potential to revive the company. \u201cYes I do have some exposure,\u201d he said.  \u201cI wish I could say that I got in at the wides, but that would not be true,\u201d said Jackson, referring to the moment when GE\u2019s credit spreads were the most aggravated.  GE is not the only company under pressure to reduce its debt balance.  From 2015-2018, as low interest rates enabled companies to take on more debt, U.S. non-financial company leverage rose to 15 times earnings from 12 times just after the 2008 financial crisis, according to research from Moody\u2019s Investors Service.  Like GE, some of those companies are now looking to lighten that load. AB InBev has announced plans to reduce its $100 billion debt load, and Kraft Heinz, Verizon Communications and AT&T have all put themselves on debt diets this year.  While the risk of distraction may be high now that the Federal Reserve has paused its rate hikes, \u201ccompanies that did these big mega-deals and levered up to do them,\u201d said Jackson, now must \u201clive up to their commitments to delever.\u201d (Reporting by Kate Duguid Editing by Dan Burns and Susan Thomas)","258":"June 8 (Reuters) - General Electric Co:  * GE REOPENS PRIOR DEBT OFFERINGS FOR $3 BILLION IN PROCEEDS TO ENHANCE AND EXTEND LIQUIDITY  * GE - GE EXPECTS TO USE PROCEEDS TO REDUCE SHORTER-DURATION DEBT  * GE - IN RESPONSE TO A REVERSE INQUIRY FROM A LONG-TERM STRATEGIC INVESTOR, REOPENED PORTIONS OF ITS PRIOR DEBT OFFERINGS FOR GE COMPANY & GE CAPITAL  * GE - EXPECTS TO USE PROCEEDS TO REPAY PORTION OF GE\u2019S INTERCOMPANY DEBT OBLIGATIONS TO GE CAPITAL  * GE - EXPECTS TO PROCEEDS TO REDUCE GE CAPITAL\u2019S OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS.

Before the meeting, Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller told reporters that one of the biggest changes under Culp is that GE is focusing on operations in quarterly reviews of its business.  In the past, such reviews were more high level and focused on financial results first and operations second, she said, noting she and Culp met with aviation on Monday, healthcare on Tuesday and plan to meet with the power business in about two weeks.

In comment on the tariffs set up by President Donald Trump, Flannery said GE imports about $2.9 billion worth of goods annually from China, roughly 10 percent of total its imports. The cost of the tariffs \u201ccould be $300 to $400 million at a gross level before any mitigating factors,\u201d he said.

REUTERS\/Alwyn Scott  Several major U.S. utilities with fleets of GE generators told Reuters they are halting or deferring maintenance, much of it handled by GE, because the work is not possible under social distancing restrictions. The work can be safely put off in part because coronavirus lockdowns have cut power demand, the utilities say.  Revenue from fixing power plants is increasingly important for GE now that the Boston-based conglomerate has slimmed down to aviation, power equipment and medical devices. Wall Street\u2019s concerns have focused on the aviation business, but when GE reports its first-quarter results on Wednesday, it may have to explain challenges to power as well.  \u201cWe have deferred routine maintenance activities to the limit possible at these facilities but are still performing the work needed to maintain reliability,\u201d Jim Hopson, a spokesman for the Tennessee Valley Authority, which operates across seven states, told Reuters. It operates a fleet of more than a dozen large GE-made natural gas turbines.  TVA is among five large U.S. utilities with more than 130 GE turbines interviewed by Reuters. All said they are putting off some maintenance work while performing critical jobs necessary for operation, compliance and safety.  GE declined to comment, citing a quiet period. The head of its gas power business said on April 3 that crews were working on projects with more than 60 customers worldwide.  GE reported $3.6 billion in power-services revenue last quarter, second only to $5.4 billion in services revenue at its aviation unit. Maintenance of such equipment is typically provided under long-term contracts. Some bill by hours of plant or engine use. For others, accounting rules require work to be performed before GE can record revenue, industry experts said.  GE\u2019s once-high-flying aviation unit has been hit by the drop in air travel, adding to the toll from hundreds of Boeing Co\u2019s grounded 737 MAX jetliners. A GE joint venture makes MAX engines.  \u201cGE\u2019s financial performance will be severely impacted in 2020, as long-term service agreements have been a large source of revenue in GE\u2019s aviation and power divisions,\u201d said Kathy Hipple, a financial analyst at Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.  Sales of new power equipment also are at risk. \u201cUtilities are likely to be watching power demand carefully, and may postpone capital investments until they get greater visibility on demand for power,\u201d Hipple said.  Other issues are adding to GE\u2019s headwinds. Low interest rates have raised pension costs and liabilities for long-term-care insurance policies, which will hit GE at year-end. Falling oil prices have wiped out $1.4 billion in value from GE\u2019s stake in Baker Hughes Co since early March, money that would help GE pay down debt.  GE last month cut its profit forecast and warned cash outflows could hit $2 billion in the first quarter.  Wall Street analysts expect GE to post 8 cents a share in profit for the first quarter, and have cut price targets for GE stock by nearly one-third since early March, to an average of $9.46, according to data from Refinitiv.  GE\u2019s stock closed at $6.26 on Friday.  UP IN THE AIR  Maintenance deferrals do not pose immediate risk to electricity supplies, utilities and industry experts say. Lower demand cuts strain on equipment. New York City power demand is down by 21%, on average, the New York Independent System Operator said. California\u2019s demand fell as much as 7% during peaks since stay-at-home orders took effect last month.  Dominion Energy Inc, which has about 15 large GE turbines, said it is deferring about 75% of its non-critical, scheduled maintenance, including large projects requiring hundreds of workers for a week or more. Some work is being canceled and other rescheduled.  \u201cSome of it quite frankly is up in the air,\u201d said Chris Dibble, director of Dominion\u2019s power generation operations. \u201cWe are not sure when we can start bringing people back en masse.\u201d  Entergy Corp, which has more than 20 large GE turbines, said it is postponing planned work that could affect power for hospitals and nursing homes. \u201cIf the crew is not able to maintain adequate social distance, the job or task should be postponed,\u201d said Neal Kirby, an Entergy spokesman.","270":"Feb 25 (Reuters) - General Electric Co said on Monday it would sell its biopharma business to Danaher Corp for $21.4 billion, as the U.S. industrial conglomerate sheds non-core businesses to focus on its industrial unit.

(tmsnrt.rs\/2PnISH3)  Before the announcement, prices on a number of its bonds had fallen far below par value, after new Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp noted the \u201curgency\u201d of shoring up the conglomerate\u2019s weak finances.  Once a symbol of American business power and management prowess, GE has faltered badly. Problems with its finance arm caused heavy losses during the 2008 financial crisis and forced it to take a Warren Buffett bailout; since then it has it been trying to rebuild its industrial businesses.  It has had three CEOs since July 2017 and its stock has fallen more than 80 percent since 2000.  GE said it will sell up to 101.2 million Baker Hughes shares on the open market and that Baker Hughes will buy 65 million of its own shares from GE, using a $1.5 billion repurchase arsenal Baker Huges already has authorized. Based on Tuesday\u2019s share price, the sale would raise about $4 billion.  After the sale, GE will own about 50.4 percent of Baker Hughes, according to analysts. The trades speed up the plan former GE CEO John Flannery laid out in June to sell all of the 62.5 percent Baker Hughes stake over two to three years. GE has a six-month lock up on its remaining stake in the oilfield company and expects sell the remainder over the next several years.

The struggling energy, health and transportation conglomerate also said it would fall short of its forecast for free cash flow and earnings per share for 2018 due to weakness in its power business, something analysts had expected.  GE shares jumped 7 percent to close at $12.09 as investors bet that Culp could re-energize the GE brand and more quickly transform its portfolio. The stock was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 .SPX. The shares had more than halved since Flannery, a three-decade GE veteran, became CEO in August 2017 to replace Jeff Immelt, who had led GE since 2001. With a market capitalization below $100 billion as of Friday, GE was worth less than a fifth of its peak value a generation ago.  GE Power\u2019s falling profits last year forced GE to slash its overall profit outlook and cut its dividend for only the second time since the Great Depression.  GE's board, meeting in the last few days, unanimously picked Culp as its new CEO. Culp, 55, who was named to GE's board in February, was CEO of industrial equipment supplier Danaher Corp DHR.N from 2000 to 2014, helping grow the company into a broader conglomerate through a series of acquisitions, while also growing earnings.  Some analysts said that GE Power likely missed financial targets for the third quarter, contributing to Flannery\u2019s ouster. GE, scheduled to report results on Oct. 25, declined to comment.  The broad strategies are likely to be similar because the plan laid out by Flannery was made in conjunction with heavy involvement from the board, which included Culp, said Gabelli & Co analyst Justin Bergner.  SHADOW OF ITS FORMER SELF  GE\u2019s board was unhappy with the pace of the company\u2019s turnaround under Flannery, and when the size of the writedown in the power plant division, which makes electric generating equipment, became apparent, the board was persuaded to seek a new CEO, according to a person familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations.  However, GE will not be changing its announced breakup plan, which calls for spinning off healthcare and shedding its stake in oil services company Baker Hughes BHGE.N, the source added.  Culp indicated that he will tackle the company\u2019s problems aggressively. \u201cWe will move with urgency. ... We have a lot of work ahead of us to unlock the value of GE,\u201d he said in a statement.  The troubles in the power plant unit have been intensifying, as Reuters reported in July, with the news that one of its most valuable clients, Saudi Arabia, was lining up competitors to bid against GE for lucrative power plant work.  GE doubled down on fossil fuels in 2015 under Immelt with the $10.3 billion purchase of French group Alstom SA's ALSO.PA power business. The deal expanded GE's exposure to gas, coal and nuclear power. It added employees, dozens of factories and service centers at a time when GE was trying to cut costs.  FILE PHOTO: General Electric CEO John Flannery is seen at the company\u2019s office in New York City, U.S., June 26, 2018. REUTERS\/Alwyn Scott  \u201cThe board is signaling to the market that we are not going to give anyone free reign like we did with Jeff Immelt,\u201d said Morningstar analyst Joshua Aguilar.  The power division\u2019s outlook appeared to worsen last month when GE said several power plants equipped with its newest turbines had to be shut down because of a part failure.  Changing CEOs \u201cwon\u2019t fix short-term problems at power, but Larry, as an outsider, will be able to make the difficult decisions on cost,\u201d said Scott Davis, an analyst at Melius Research in New York. \u201cGE is bloated and its culture is destroyed.\u201d  Davis said the stock price has probably already adjusted to expectations of no contribution from power.  A slimmed down General Electric - a 126-year-old conglomerate that was once the most valuable U.S. corporation and a global symbol of American business power -- will focus on jet engines, power plants and renewable energy.  In June, GE lost its spot in the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI after over a century.  \u201cInvestors grew impatient with the lack of improvement and with the sheer scale of the problems uncovered. However, these problems were not created under [Flannery\u2019s] tenure,\u201d CFRA analyst Jim Corridore said in a note. \u201cThe market seems to be welcoming a change in leadership but the new CEO will be facing many of the same problems.\u201d  GE said the power division\u2019s goodwill balance is about $23 billion and the impairment charge would eliminate most of it. The non-cash charge primarily relates to GE\u2019s acquisition of power assets from Alstom in 2015, GE said.  GE's long stock slide means the once-largest U.S. industrial company is now only sixth in terms of market capitalization, behind Boeing Co BA.N, 3M Co MMM.N, Honeywell International Inc HON.N, United Technologies Corp UTX.N and others.

Baker Hughes on Tuesday posted negative free cash flow of $419 million, compared with analysts\u2019 estimates of a positive $188.5 million.  Baker Hughes Chief Financial Officer Brian Worrell attributed the reasons for the negative cash flow to annual payments related to employee compensation, delay in realizing some revenue and higher inventory that was built in expectations of more activity in the forthcoming quarters.  \u201cIt\u2019s an overall negative print because of the cash flow... working capital has been an issue for a lot of oilfield services companies, but this was particularly weak and their capital expenditure also was higher-than-expected,\u201d BMO Capital Markets analyst Daniel Boyd said.

The change will allow for better returns that help reduce the amount of reserves it must set aside for claims, Anthony Grandolfo, the chief investment officer of GE\u2019s insurance business, told analysts on a conference call.  Asked about increased risk, he said GE was still being prudent. \u201cWe\u2019re starting from a point where we think (the portfolio) is quite conservative and we expect to continue to maintain a portfolio that is quite conservative,\u201d said Grandolfo, who was hired as GE\u2019s first dedicated chief investment officer for insurance in October.  Only 2 percent of GE\u2019s insurance assets are currently in non-investment-grade investments - much less than the 12 percent average in the industry, Grandolfo said, citing a Goldman Sachs study. GE plans to gradually increase its level to 8 percent by 2024, he added.  GE has also hired two other executives to run its insurance unit: Chief Executive Officer Tim Kneeland, who formerly handled long-term care policies at Transamerica, and Managing Director Bob Deutsch, former chief financial officer at CNA Financial.  In a presentation here that repeated information GE supplied in its annual report last week, the Boston-based conglomerate said it has achieved about $500 million worth of premium increases that it is in the process of putting in place. It is also pressing for $1.2 billion in further increases to help stem losses on some 300,000 long-term care insurance policies, which cover costs for services such as in-home or nursing-home care.  GE shares were up 2.3 percent at $9.32 on Thursday.  Investor focus now turns to GE\u2019s presentation of its full-year forecast, scheduled for March 14.  GE shocked investors when it took a surprise $6.2 billion after-tax charge last year and began setting aside $15 billion - one of the largest such amounts ever - to cover the policies that were underwritten more than a decade ago, when actuaries did not yet know how costly the claims would become.  GE\u2019s insurance losses are among a host of problems the 127-year-old company is facing as it attempts a breakup under new Chief Executive Larry Culp in an effort to restore profit and buoy its stock, which has tumbled to less than a third of its value in mid-2016.  The company also said it is looking at \u201coptions\u201d to reduce its insurance risk, adding to hints from Culp on Tuesday about possible sales of parts of the business.  GE\u2019s massive power-plant business is hemorrhaging cash and contending with falling sales and technical problems, while the company is selling assets to pay down its outsized debt.  Since last year, GE has reduced the total amount of insurance reserves it plans to set aside to $14.5 billion by 2024 after completing an analysis of the policies.  But some analysts have said GE may need to nearly double that amount because assumptions it used to calculate the exposure are optimistic.  As a reinsurer, GE cannot seek premium increases directly. It must rely on about 30 companies that underwrote the policies it holds to seek increases from regulators in the numerous U.S. states where they were sold.  GE\u2019s target for new reserves amounts to about $55,000 per policy, compared with $77,282 at Humana Inc and $10,614 at Unum Group, according to an analysis for Reuters by Audit Analytics, an independent research company based in Massachusetts.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The move comes after Chief Executive Officer John Flannery, who took over as CEO last summer, indicated to analysts and investors for the first time last month that he was open to breaking up the company and said that a spinoff of any of its units, which include power, healthcare and aviation, was a possibility.  Divesting the industrial gas engine business, which includes the Jenbacher and Waukesha engines, would help streamline GE\u2019s power division, whose profit plunged 45 percent last year as sales of power plants and services fell sharply.  GE has hired Citigroup Inc C.N to prepare a sale process for the industrial gas business, the sources said on Friday. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.  A GE spokeswoman declined to comment, while a Citigroup spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The unit for sale makes multi-ton gas turbines that generate on-site power to keep industrial plants running. Jenbacher and Waukesha engines cover the small to mid-sized segment of GE\u2019s power business, ranging from 100 kilowatts to 10 megawatts.  Flannery said last November that GE would exit at least $20 billion in operations, as it tries to shore up its financial performance.  As part of this review, GE is exploring options for its transportation unit, which makes railway locomotives; its iconic lighting division, which makes bulbs for consumers; and its healthcare information technology business.  The company\u2019s stock has lost half its value in the last 12 months and Flannery is under pressure from investors, including activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management LP which sits on its board of directors, to turn the business around.  GE disclosed last month that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating its accounting for part of its services backlog, and a set of actuarial calculations that caused GE to take a charge for long-term-care policies it underwrote a decade ago.  GE took a $6.2 billion after-tax charge on those policies in the fourth quarter and said it will set aside $15 billion more in reserves over the next seven years to cover potential claims on the policies.  Earlier this week, GE said it had reached a deal to sell parts of its overseas lighting business to a company controlled by former executive Joerg Bauer for an undisclosed amount.","297":"(Reuters) - General Electric Co on Tuesday warned of more job cuts at its aviation unit, citing a lengthy recovery for the airline industry from the impact of the coronavirus crisis.

The company\u2019s shares were up about 5% at $10.58.  The Boston-based conglomerate in May announced plans to cut the global workforce at its aviation unit by as much as 25% in 2020, or up to 13,000 jobs, citing prolonged aircraft reduction schedules caused by the pandemic.

But insurance experts are concerned that may not be enough.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of U.S. conglomerate General Electric is pictured at the company's site of its energy branch in Belfort, France, February 5, 2019. REUTERS\/Vincent Kessler  GE shocked investors last year when it took a $6.2 billion after-tax charge and said it planned to set aside $15 billion over seven years to cover claims on some 300,000 long-term care policies written more than a decade ago, when actuaries did not yet know how costly the claims would become.  The costs, which far exceeded GE\u2019s estimates, sent its shares tumbling, spurred an investor lawsuit and prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate.  Last week, GE provided new details about its insurance and scheduled a \u201cteach in\u201d for Thursday to give more information.  GE\u2019s new reserves amount to about $55,000 per policy, in line with those of other long-term care insurers, according to an analysis for Reuters by Audit Analytics, an independent research company based in Massachusetts.  For comparison, Humana Inc has set aside $77,282 per policy, while Unum Group has set aside $10,614, Audit Analytics said.  For a graphic, click: tmsnrt.rs\/2EEXWt1  Those amounts are less than the cost of one year\u2019s stay in a private nursing-home room, which averages $92,376 in the United States, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said.  GE has since cut $500 million from the $15 billion in reserves it plans to make for the policies through 2024. Its latest loss recognition test required only a $65 million after-tax charge, a sign, it said, that its estimates are on track.  But GE\u2019s disclosures and reserves have not eliminated fears that insurance could bring more pain to GE and its investors.  \u201cI think it is impossible to know whether the $15 billion is enough,\u201d Joseph Belth, professor emeritus of insurance at Indiana University, who has written extensively about long-term care policies, told Reuters after reviewing GE\u2019s disclosures.  Long-term care coverage, which typically pays for in-home, assisted living or skilled nursing care, has required many insurers to boost reserves in recent years. In one rare case, regulators in 2017 placed Penn Treaty American Corp, a U.S. insurer that wrote such policies, in liquidation due to losses.  Unlike, say, fire insurance on a home, which is unlikely to pay out, most long-term care policies do pay claims eventually. Policies can be imprecise about what is covered, leaving room for legal battles that make costs hard for insurers to estimate, experts said. And policy holders or family members usually decide when and where to seek care, which made it tricky for insurers in the early days to set premiums that cover costs over time.  \u201cA VERY RISKY PRODUCT\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to put your arms around the risk,\u201d said Bruno Caron, a credit analyst at A.M. Best, a New Jersey-based credit rating agency that specializes in insurance companies.  Increasing reserves generally reduces the risk of future losses, but \u201csometimes reserves signal a deficiency in a block of policies that reoccurs in the same block,\u201d Caron said. \u201cWe view long-term care insurance as a very risky product.\u201d  GE said it set reserves based on assumptions that reflect its \u201cemerging experience\u201d with long-term care policies.  Several analysts said GE is being overly optimistic. GE would need another $12 billion in reserves if it stopped assuming that generally better health means fewer people will seek care, known as \u201cmorbidity improvement,\u201d and changed other favorable assumptions as some rivals have, said John Inch, an analyst at Gordon Haskett Research Advisors.  Others noted GE lost out on premium increases that rivals got by moving quickly when long-term care costs became apparent.  \u201cThey (GE) were very slow in reacting to emerging experience relative to peers,\u201d said Douglas Meyer, a long-term care insurance specialist and managing director at Fitch Ratings. Now GE has \u201csignificantly less repricing flexibility\u201d because it cannot make up for past premium increases others received.  Two GE subsidiaries hold its long-term care insurance: Employers Reassurance Corp and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Co. Both are reinsurers, which means GE must pay out on policies that others wrote and is prevented from seeking premium rate increases directly from state insurance commissions, experts said. It is unclear how many companies that wrote the coverage have sought increase for policies in GE\u2019s portfolio, they added.  GE said that it is working with insurers to obtain increases. Its reserve calculation anticipates about $1.7 billion in premium increases or benefit reductions, but those include increases that are not yet approved by regulators and requests for increases that have not yet been filed.","301":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Portfolio manager Michael Kon began buying General Electric Co shares about a year ago and got more last fall after GE Chief Executive Larry Culp outlined plans to reboot the ailing power-plant unit.

Wall Street analysts expect GE to earn 70 cents a share this year and generate $1.9 billion in free cash flow, on average, according to data from Refinitiv.  GE optimists, spurred by Culp\u2019s actions, have fueled a 53 percent rally from the stock\u2019s low in December. As the first outsider to head the 127-year-old conglomerate, Culp has cracked open GE\u2019s books to more scrutiny, shaken up its board and stationed new leaders in trouble spots like power and insurance.  But Culp still faces many skeptics who dumped the stock as GE racked up staggering losses of more than $30 billion over the last two years and cut its dividend to near zero.  The camps are unusually divided: Of 19 analysts who cover the company, nine rate its stock \u201chold\u201d or \u201cstrong sell\u201d while 10 rate it \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201cstrong buy,\u201d according to Refinitiv.  MURKY OUTLOOK  Those views did not change much even after GE reported a $22 billion loss in January or told investors last week its industrial businesses will lose cash in 2019.  GE shares are down 15 percent since Culp took over in October, and they are worth less than a third of their value in 2016.  Some analysts count Culp\u2019s candor as positive and say the cash flow warning shows serious investment in restructuring.  But others say the changes have clouded GE\u2019s outlook and want Culp to paint a credible picture of its future.  GE\u2019s strategy of selling assets to pay off its outsized debt, for example, is ditching some of its most cash-generative businesses, such as rail and biopharma, said John Inch, analyst at Gordon Haskett Research Advisors. GE\u2019s power unit has cut 12,000 jobs and 30 percent of facility space but plans to spend more on restructuring this year, he added.  \u201cJust exactly what are you doing in power with all that restructuring money?\u201d Inch asked.  GE\u2019s forced asset sales also mean GE is not getting good prices, said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management LLC.  Investors who buy GE stock thinking it is cheap are ignoring cash outflows, strategy uncertainty and the fact that GE cannot afford to pay a dividend.  \u201cThe reality is, it\u2019s at $9 for a very good reason,\u201d said Pursche, who\u2019s firm sold when GE cut its dividend in 2017 and won\u2019t buy until the dividend returns and the outlook is clear.  \u201cUntil you get a cohesive growth strategy,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s no compelling reason to invest.\u201d","302":"NEW YORK, April 20 (Reuters) - General Electric CO said on Friday it had decided to sell its distributed power business and may be able to announce a deal by mid-year, confirming an earlier Reuters report.

REUTERS\/Aly Song  NEW YORK (Reuters) - The stock market\u2019s gyrations have grabbed the year-end headlines, but another key financial market, investment-grade U.S. corporate debt, is turning in its worst yearly performance since the financial crisis a decade ago.  General Electric Co's GE.N securities have weighed on both markets as the 126-year-old conglomerate founded by Thomas Edison has suffered staggering losses and asset writedowns.  GE shares have skidded around 56 percent in 2018, the fourth-biggest decline in the S&P 500 Index .SPX. GE's $120 billion of bonds are not down as much, but the securities, which have long been a staple for fixed income managers around the globe, are among the leading drags on the main indexes tracking the $6 trillion investment-grade corporate debt sector.  GE's bonds have crashed by around 14 percent - a monumental underperformance in bond market terms. Analysts worry this could signal worse times ahead for investment grade credit overall. According to the Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch index, .MERC0A0 the sector's total 2018 return is negative 2.5 percent, the largest drop since 2008.  U.S. companies feasted on low interest rates in the decade since the crisis, leaving corporate balance sheets leveraged to the hilt with some $9.1 trillion of debt, almost double the 2007 total of $4.9 trillion, according to Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.  Now the Federal Reserve\u2019s gradual tightening of its easy-money policy has investors rethinking their commitment to these assets. Bonds from dozens of formerly high-quality issuers are already trading as though they were no longer investment grade.  As interest rates rise, \u201cthe weaker links are going to be exposed,\u201d said Kathleen Gaffney, director of diversified fixed income at Eaton Vance.  After this year\u2019s sharp slide in GE shares, its debt load now stands at roughly twice its market capitalization of $63 billion.  KEEPING PLENTY OF COMPANY  GE\u2019s debt is not alone in the doghouse.  Bonds from Ford Motor Co F.N, AT&T Corp T.N, Kinder Morgan KMI.N, CVS Health CVS.N, General Motors Co GM.N and Verizon Communications VZ.N also ranked among the weakest performers as the year wound down. Of the bottom 20 performers, 14 were triple-B rated, the lowest tier of investment grade. GE debt has been slashed to BBB+ which is just three steps above junk, and more than a third of GE's bonds are already trading at junk bond levels.  Bonds most likely to be downgraded to junk are expected to be among the worst performers when the next economic downturn hits, according to Monica Erickson, portfolio manager of global developed credit at DoubleLine Capital LP.  She noted that around $3 trillion of triple-B bonds are now outstanding, comprising roughly half of the investment grade market, up from only about 20 percent a decade ago.  \u201cWith the triple-B market worth about $3 trillion, finding a buyer in the $1.2 trillion high-yield market could be difficult\u201d in a downturn, she said. Many fund managers are required to keep only investment-grade debt in their portfolios, so they could be forced to sell at steep discounts if the debt gets downgraded to junk.  Currently, the junk market totals $1.2 trillion. Were GE to lose investment grade status, those bonds alone would suddenly account for around 10 percent of the high-yield market.  Not all triple-B credits will be downgraded in the event of a downturn, however, \u201cyou will probably have a larger percentage of this entire (investment grade) market shift into this high-yield market than has been the case historically,\u201d Erickson said.  HOW MUCH GE DO YOU OWN?  GE\u2019s new Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp is battling to restore profits and slash debt after the company lost $22.8 billion last quarter, mostly from its ailing power unit.  To shore up cash, it has slashed its once-fat quarterly dividend to just a penny per share, and Culp said GE would proceed with \u201curgency\u201d on selling assets.  Those efforts have so far fallen short in the eyes of bond holders and credit ratings agencies.  In response to a request for comment, a GE spokesperson referred to Culp\u2019s statements in its third-quarter earnings report and in recent media interviews about debt-reduction plans.  All three major bond raters have slashed GE\u2019s credit ratings twice in the last 13 months. It is now labeled \u201cBBB+\u201d by Standard & Poor\u2019s, with equivalent ratings from Moody\u2019s and Fitch.  Roughly $43 billion worth of GE bonds sport prices of less than 90 cents on the dollar, with more than $17.5 billion selling for less than 80 cents. The lowest, a $2 billion perpetual bond 369604BN2= sold in 2015, is currently quoted at about 63 cents on the dollar and now yields 17.5 percent versus its 4.1 percent coupon rate.  By comparison, the average triple-B bond yields 4.7 percent, according to BAML index data.  The cost to insure GE bonds against default is near the highest since the financial crisis. Yet the biggest risk facing bond investors is being unable to sell their holdings if the company\u2019s credit fundamentals worsen.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of sellers and no buyers,\u201d said a GE debt investor who asked not to be named because of compliance reasons. And so \u201cwe have not yet sold our debt holdings.\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019ve seen people head towards the exit, and there\u2019s not a buyer, so you get a big trade down,\u201d the investor said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s getting questions from their boss or their client asking \u2018how much GE do you own?\u2019\u201d","308":"(Corrects 15th paragraph to say O\u2019Boyle spoke in an interview on Monday.)  NEW YORK, March 2 (Reuters) - Jack Welch, who upended the business world in the 1980s and 1990s by transforming General Electric Co from a stolid maker of light bulbs and washing machines into the most valuable U.S. public company, has died at 84, GE said on Monday.  Known as \u201cNeutron Jack\u201d for cutting thousands of jobs, Welch bought and sold scores of businesses, expanded the industrial giant into financial services and produced steadily rising profits. His success led other CEOs to begin using financial wizardry to improve earnings and wow Wall Street.  In Welch\u2019s 20 years as CEO, GE\u2019s market value grew from $12 billion to $410 billion, making him one of the most iconic corporate leaders of his era.  \u201cWhen the book about business leaders in this century is written, Jack Welch will be near the very top,\u201d said Thomas Cooke, professor at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business. \u201cWhat he did as the leader of GE was remarkable.\u201d  President Donald Trump tweeted: \u201cThere was no corporate leader like \u201cneutron\u201d Jack,\u201d adding his warmest sympathies \u201cto his wonderful wife & family!\u201d  But Welch\u2019s innovations, which included ruthless personnel management, cost cutting and offshoring, also set the stage for problems that would hit the company years after he left.  John F. Welch, Jr., followed Reginald Jones as CEO in April 1981 and served in that role until he retired in September 2001, choosing Jeff Immelt as his successor.  Two of Welch\u2019s other top disciples - and Immelt rivals - left GE to head other major companies, helping spread Welch\u2019s gospel: Jim McNerney at Boeing Co and Bob Nardelli at Chrysler and Home Depot Inc.  \u201cToday is a sad day for the entire GE family,\u201d current GE Chairman and CEO Larry Culp said in a statement. \u201cJack was larger than life and the heart of GE for half a century. He reshaped the face of our company and the business world.\u201d  The outsized financing business Welch built nearly toppled GE during the 2008 financial crisis, requiring a bailout from legendary investor Warren Buffett. Immelt sold most of GE Capital and GE now trades at a fraction of its peak value.  Welch acquired new businesses and did not hesitate to use layoffs and outsourcing to streamline them, sometimes leaving shattered, embittered communities behind. He faced criticism - particularly after he retired from GE - for his cavalier attitude about offshoring and shutting U.S. plants, a theme that has grown more potent since the election of President Trump.  The U.S. industrial belt is dotted with communities devastated by GE\u2019s downsizing. At its peak, for instance, GE employed 30,000 at a sprawling integrated industrial plant in Schenectady, New York, that now employs fewer than 3,000.  Both Welch\u2019s style of management and the strategy he pursued to expand GE have since fallen from favor. CEOs who order mass layoffs now get attacked in tweets from the Oval Office, and Wall Street has lost its appetite for conglomerates.  Welch also made GE a training ground for business leaders and advocated aggressively ousting poor performers. In a 2001 New Yorker interview, he said, \u201cIf they\u2019re in the bottom 10, they get zero raises, zero stock options, they don\u2019t get a bit of bonus, they get zero.\u201d  Thomas F. O\u2019Boyle, author of the 1998 book \u201cAt Any Cost: Jack Welch, General Electric, and the Pursuit of Profit,\u201d was an early critic of Welch\u2019s tenure. In an interview on Monday, O\u2019Boyle said: \u201cYou have to look at the totality of what occurred based on the strategy Welch initiated: the de-emphasizing of manufacturing, offshoring as many jobs as possible, and emphasizing financial services in GE Capital for earnings growth.\u201d  O\u2019Boyle noted that 80% of the some 1,000 acquisitions under Welch were in financial services. \u201cAnd that strategy had terrible, terrible consequences for General Electric in the long run.\u201d  A DIMINISHED CONGLOMERATE  In 1980, the year before Welch became CEO, GE recorded revenues of $26.8 billion; in 2000, the year before he left, they were nearly $130 billion. In 2001, GE was one of the largest and most valuable companies in the world, up from America\u2019s tenth-largest by market cap in 1981.  Yet today, GE has sold most of the divisions Welch added, and many fault Welch for much of GE\u2019s recent decline.  \u201cHe was lauded in business schools, and many CEOs considered him a role model, but few today would praise his tactics,\u201d said Erik Gordon, assistant professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business. \u201cHe left a bloated, hollow mess to his successors. GE went from being a titan of industry to a dismembered wreck.\u201d  The company spun off its insurance business into Genworth Financial Inc in 2004, for example, but kept a large batch of money-losing policies written during Welch\u2019s tenure. Those forced GE in 2018 to take a $6.2 billion charge and set aside $15 billion in reserves.  In 2015, activist investor Nelson Pelz\u2019s Trian Partners bought a $2.5 billion stake in GE and pushed for further focus on core industrial businesses, prompting Immelt to sell most of the remaining parts of GE Capital.  ENGINEER BY TRAINING  Born in 1935, Welch earned his B.S. degree in chemical engineering at the University of Massachusetts, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in chemical engineering at the University of Illinois in 1960.  That same year, Welch joined GE as a chemical engineer at its plastics division in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. He was elected the company\u2019s youngest vice president in 1972 and became vice chairman in 1979.  While his GE career is mostly seen as an upward trajectory, it included an early setback. In 1963, the Pittsfield plastics factory had an explosion that tore off the roof, and Welch was nearly fired. He later touted the experience as part of what created his management approach, noting that a manager at the time talked him through what he could have done better.  Books by Welch include \u201cWinning,\u201d from 2005. He co-wrote a column with his wife Suzy Welch for Reuters and other media.  \u201cBefore you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others,\u201d Welch wrote in \u201cWinning.\u201d","309":"(Reuters) - General Electric Co bonds rallied broadly on Monday after the company struck a deal to sell its biopharma business to Danaher Corp for $21.4 billion and said it would use cash from the deal to ease its massive debt burden.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of U.S. conglomerate General Electric is pictured at the company's site of its energy branch in Belfort, France, February 5, 2019. REUTERS\/Vincent Kessler  Yields on GE bonds, which move in the opposite direction of their price, fell to the lowest in about four months across dozens of debt securities and the risk premium demanded by investors in exchange for holding GE paper declined. The price to insure its bonds against default also sank, registering their largest one-day drop in at least three years, according to data from IHS Markit.  The price increase on GE\u2019s roughly $120 billion of bonds was the latest leg in a recovery so far this year after they took a pounding in late 2018 when its new chief executive, Larry Culp, said earlier restructuring efforts were falling short and that the company would need to take more-aggressive action to address its debt load in particular.  (GRAPHIC: Dozens of GE bonds rally after Danaher deal announcement - tmsnrt.rs\/2EybQ01)  Culp slashed GE\u2019s quarterly dividend to just a penny a share and has since struck a raft of deals to sell assets. The bulk of proceeds have been pledged toward working down its debt, which at one point in late 2018 was roughly twice GE\u2019s market capitalization as its stock price plunged to a low of $6.66 a share in December.  The three main credit rating agencies - Moody\u2019s Investors Service, S&P Global Markets and Fitch Ratings - peg GE debt at just three notches above junk bond levels. For much of the fourth quarter of 2018, its bonds were trading as though they were no longer investment-grade securities.  GE bonds\u2019 broad underperformance last year, when they skidded by around 14 percent, weighed heavily on the U.S. corporate bond market overall. Bonds rated on a par with GE\u2019s in the so-called triple-B range now account for roughly half of the $6 trillion investment-grade sector, and GE alone would account for 10 percent of the junk bond market should it ever lose its investment-grade rating.  (GRAPHIC: GE credit spreads tighten after Danaher deal news - tmsnrt.rs\/2EwZPaY)  One of GE\u2019s most active bonds on Monday, its $11.5 billion of 4.418 percent notes due in November 2035, jumped 2.6 points in price to regain the 90 cents on the dollar level for the first time since late October. In mid-November they had dropped to as low as 77 cents on the dollar.  The spread of their yield over Treasuries, a measure of the additional compensation demanded by investors for holding riskier securities, narrowed to a four-month low of 222 basis points, having tightened by about 200 basis points since November.  The announcement also further eased concerns about GE\u2019s solvency that had grown markedly last year, reflected in a surge in the price for GE credit default swaps, a form of insurance against default, during the fourth quarter. On Monday, however, GE\u2019s CDS prices sank to their lowest since mid-October.

Shares of GE, which employs thousands of workers in China and had been seen as heavily exposed to the economic weakness caused by the virus, were up 2% at $11.10 in premarket trading.  Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp, who is restructuring GE after a series of failures, in January forecast its first-quarter free cash flow at a negative $2 billion, largely due to the grounding of Boeing Co\u2019s 737 MAX for which it makes engines.  At that point the company said it would recover to generate between $2 billion to $4 billion in positive cashflow this year, and an adjusted profit of 50 cents to 60 cents per share. Analysts have estimated this year\u2019s cashflow at a positive $2.77 billion.  The U.S. industrial conglomerate also expects a hit of $200 million to $300 million to its first-quarter operating profit from the virus, which has crushed economic activity in China and disrupted global supply chains.  \u201cIt\u2019s a very conservative outlook and accommodates a lot of headwinds... basically it sails through everything,\u201d William Blair analyst Nicholas Heymann said.

REUTERS\/Stephane Mahe\/File Photo  MLS Co 002745.SZ and Foshan Electrical and Lighting Co 000541.SZ, both lighting manufacturers based in southern China's Guangdong province, have been in talks with lenders to finance a potential bid for the asset, one of the people said.  GE on Monday sent out teasers to interested parties about the sale process, to be followed by information memos in a couple of weeks and a first round of bidding thereafter, another source said.  GE declined to comment. MLS could not be reached for comment, while Foshan did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The people could not be named as the information is confidential.  In mid-February, GE reached a deal to sell the European parts of its overseas lighting business to a company controlled by former executive Joerg Bauer for an undisclosed amount. That marked the first step in the divesture of the lighting business.  Shedding the remaining, mainly U.S.-based lighting business is part of a broad restructuring plan aimed at divesting $20 billion worth of assets to focus the remaining company on three core divisions: power, aviation and health care.  Among other options, GE is exploring a sale of its industrial gas engine business that could be worth as much as $2 billion, people close to the matter said last month.  Profit at GE\u2019s lighting business fell sharply last year. It earned $93 million on revenue of nearly $2 billion in 2017, down from $199 million on $4.8 billion in 2016.  The U.S. lighting activities will also be shopped to peers such as Cree CREE.O, Acuity AYI.N, Leviton, Hubbell HUBB.N and Eaton ETN.N, one of the people said.  GE said last month they would be marketed as part of a separate sale or sales.","312":"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - General Electric Co's GE.N chief executive for Latin America took part in a medical equipment price-fixing scheme while at the conglomerate, making it a member of an international health-care cartel, according to allegations in a document filed by federal prosecutors.  The General Electric logo is pictured on the General Electric offshore wind turbine plant in Montoir-de-Bretagne, near Saint-Nazaire, western France, November 21, 2016. REUTERS\/Stephane Mahe\/File Photo - RC17D8EEBBE0  The executive, Daurio Speranzini Jr., was one of 20 people jailed last week in what prosecutors say was an arrangement among multinational companies Philips PHG.AS, Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N, and several others. They say the scheme involved bribing government health officials, in return for help in inflating prices for an array of medical gear such as magnetic resonance imaging machines and prosthetics.  While those arrests and the general allegations were widely reported last week, a close examination by Reuters of a 362-page court document filed with a Rio de Janeiro judge to gain approval to carry out arrest and search warrants shows that prosecutors also argue that GE was part of the group of companies that allegedly funneled bribes through a politically connected local medical supply firm.  That firm, Oscar Iskin, then passed varying percentages of the bribes to government officials to fix prices for medical equipment and other products, prosecutors assert.  \u201cThe situation takes on an even greater gravity given that even after the internal investigation (at Philips) that resulted in Speranzini\u2019s departure from the company, he joined another company in the health sector (GE) in which he continued carrying out illicit practices relative to government contracts,\u201d the document states.  The documents cited \u201crobust evidence\u201d that Speranzini \u201cparticipated in the crimes of corruption, fraudulent bidding, and forming a criminal organization,\u201d adding, \u201cthere is also evidence that he attempted to cover-up the crimes so that regulating bodies would not find out.\u201d  In response to questions from Reuters, GE spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said Monday that GE is \u201ccurrently not aware of any improper conduct involving GE Healthcare and are committed to cooperating with authorities to the extent we are contacted.\u201d  At the time of Speranzini\u2019s arrest on July 4, GE in a statement said that the allegations refer to a period in which the executive was leading a different company, though did not specify which one, and added that GE is not the target of the investigation.  Alexandre Lopes, a lawyer for Miguel Iskin, the CEO of the supply firm, denied the allegations of price-fixing and passing of bribes, and said the company had improved the quality of care available to the general population.  Reuters was unable to locate a lawyer for Speranzini. There are no lawyers listed in the government documents, and GE declined to comment on anything related to the executive still listed on LinkedIn as an employee.  Prosecutors declined to comment beyond what was in the document, or elaborate on whether they had contacted GE and whether they were delving into its conduct as a target. They said in their filing in Rio de Janeiro that their investigation is ongoing and that they think it will involve more companies, more arrests and the uncovering of more fraud.  It was unclear from the document whether prosecutors believe GE had been participating in the cartel before Speranzini\u2019s arrival at the company, but the document asserts that he was central to GE\u2019s involvement once he was there.  Federal prosecutors said in the document that Speranzini took part in the cartel first as the head of the Philips Healthcare operation in Latin America from 2004 until the end of 2010, when an internal whistleblower told Philips\u2019 compliance office about the fraud and he was fired after an internal probe. His firing and the internal probe at Philips have not been previously reported.  Philips spokesman Steve Klink told Reuters that they have been informed by the Brazilian authorities that the latest arrests are part of an investigation into the medical device industry in Brazil.  \u201cPhilips in Brazil, as well as other companies in the country, are subjects of the investigation. We believe that any allegation against Philips relates to a period that was many years ago,\u201d he said.  Two months after being dismissed by Philips, Speranzini was hired by GE Healthcare and climbed the company ladder, becoming a vice president in Milwaukee before being named as GE\u2019s chief executive officer for Latin America in January. GE did not comment on Speranzini\u2019s hiring.  Cesar Romero - the former No. 2 official at the Rio de Janeiro state health secretariat - states in his plea bargain testimony that Speranzini won contracts from Brazil\u2019s National Traumatology Institute while at Philips and GE to provide medical equipment at inflated prices at least until the end of 2014, prosecutors said.  The National Traumatology Institute said they could not comment, referring questions to the federal Health Ministry. The Health Ministry did not respond to requests for comment.  According to prosecutors, Romero also testified that GE was part of what he called an \u201cinternational bidding club,\u201d which included other multinational health companies such as Philips.  Lawyers for Romero did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Informants in criminal investigations in Brazil are barred by law from talking to the press.  The investigation, code-named \u201cOperation Resonance,\u201d is the latest outgrowth of Brazil\u2019s unprecedented four years of graft inquiries that have sent scores of powerful politicians and businessmen to prison and rocked the nation\u2019s elite, who enjoyed impunity in how they carried out their business.  The inquiry is tied to a long-running corruption scheme attributed to jailed former Rio state governor Sergio Cabral that snatched $100 million from public coffers, prosecutors said.","313":"(Reuters) - General Electric Co GE.N said on Monday it plans to sell a portfolio of $1 billion in energy investments to Apollo Global Management LLC APO.N, as the U.S. conglomerate sheds assets in its finance arm to focus on its industrial business.

GE, which replaced its Chief Executive Officer John Flannery in a surprise move earlier this month with outsider Larry Culp, has been divesting assets worth billions of dollars from its finance unit since 2015.  The company in June announced a breakup plan, which calls for spinning off its healthcare business and shedding its stake in oil services company Baker Hughes BHGE.N.  Financial terms of the Apollo-GE Capital deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2018, were not disclosed.  For Apollo, the deal comes amid a recovery in energy prices, with the buyout firm reported here to have been seeking to raise more than $4 billion for its third natural resources-focused private equity fund.  RBC Capital Markets, Goldman Sachs and Bank of Montreal provided financing to Apollo for the deal.  Citigroup Global Markets Inc, RBC Capital Markets and Goldman Sachs were financial advisers to Apollo, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch and PJT Partners advised GE Capital.

Iraq continues to flare some of this gas because it lacks the facilities to process it into fuel for local consumption or exports.  Gas flaring costs nearly $2.5 billion in lost revenue for the government and would be sufficient to meet most of needs for gas\u2010based power generation, according to the World Bank.  The contract with Baker Hughes and GE provides for processing the gas at the Nassiriya, Al Gharraf oilfields.  It is the second contract signed by Iraq to process gas associated with oil, after one with U.S. energy firm Orion in January.  Iraq\u2019s production of associated gas is expected to grow as the country increases its oil output capacity.

GE acquired Converteam from a private equity consortium that included Barclays Private Equity and LBO France.  GE\u2019s stock has lost half its value in the last 12 months, and Flannery is under pressure from investors, including activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management LP which sits on its board of directors, to turn the business around.  The divestiture would be the latest in a string of asset sales GE is exploring. Reuters reported in February that GE was considering divesting its industrial gas engine business, which includes the Jenbacher and Waukesha engines.  Since last year, GE has also been seeking to hive off other divisions, including its railway locomotives business, consumer lightbulbs manufacturing assets and healthcare information technology business.  GE views a spinoff of its railway locomotive unit as ore likely than a sale, given the tax hit from an outright sale, according to the sources.  Flannery said in October that GE would sell at least $20 billion in operations to shore up its financial performance.

We argued that \u201cspinning off NBC to shareholders would make GE a more focused industrial company\u201d, bring in some $35 billion of cash and aid Chief Executive Jeff Immelt\u2019s desire to bolster the group\u2019s finances. The only reason GE kept the media business was because its executives liked to hobnob with celebrities, we wrote.  General Electric Co Chief Executive Jeff Immelt listens during a news conference to discuss the company's plan to move its headquarters to the city of Boston in Boston, Massachusetts, April 4, 2016.  All of that was true. And the case for raising cash and refocusing is hard to refute now that the company is worth 80% less than it was at the time. But GE\u2019s public relations machine went on the warpath. In particular, it argued for a correction to a line that NBC \u201cis rarely among the best performers\u201d. The Wall Street Journal, which had syndicated the column, agreed. Breakingviews held its ground.  At the time, GE\u2019s tactics came across as disproportionately aggressive. Why was America\u2019s most-admired industrial company taking such offence at a piece that took as its premise the \u201cremarkable job\u201d it had done \u201cmanaging its eclectic collection of assets\u201d and beating rivals in the market? \u201cLights Out: Pride, Delusion, and the Fall of General Electric\u201d clears up the confusion. GE\u2019s corporate culture was obsessed with storytelling. Anything that swerved from its chosen narrative, even if true, was anathema.  GE\u2019s downfall has been startling. The company, whose origin myth lies with the inventor Thomas Edison but owes more to financier John Pierpont Morgan, has seen its market value drop from $600 billion at the start of the century to $53 billion today. It has been cast from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, where it was once the sole name to have endured for the benchmark\u2019s first 100 years. The company\u2019s credit rating has been slashed. Any reasonable prediction for its future is not as a vast industrial juggernaut but as the manufacturer of jet engines, and perhaps of healthcare equipment.  All this bad news has been obvious in the marketplace. But Thomas Gryta and Ted Mann, reporters at the Wall Street Journal, provide texture below the surface. They reveal what happens when executives, for want of a better expression, drink too much of their own Kool-Aid. GE bosses from Immelt on down believed they, and the company they worked for, were infallible. Mistaking a story for a strategy is how companies die.  \u201cUnder Immelt, the company believed that the will to hit a target could supersede the math, even when hundreds of thousands of livelihoods \u2013 those of investors, customers, and suppliers, to say nothing of workers retirees, and their families \u2013 hung in the balance,\u201d the authors summarise. \u201cGE became synonymous with the idea that all that stood between a company and an arbitrary $2 earnings (per share) target was drive \u2013 simply wanting it bad enough.\u201d  \u201cLights Out\u201d shows how Immelt, a hard-charging former Dartmouth football player, rode roughshod over opposition from within, including from the board of directors he ruled with an iron fist. One telling anecdote reveals how Sandy Warner, a long-serving director and former chairman of JPMorgan, was effectively cast from the board for his insistence in 2016 that Immelt accelerates his succession plans.  Hoping to exorcise the demons of GE\u2019s near-death experience during the financial crisis of 2008, Immelt and his lieutenants \u2013 including the man who would succeed him, John Flannery \u2013 were hell-bent on finding a big, transformational deal. The one they settled on, a purchase of Alstom\u2019s power assets, turned out to be an utter disaster. \u201cLights Out\u201d shows that outcome was clear even before the near-$14 billion purchase had closed. Yet Immelt\u2019s supplicants refused to back out because there was no crossing the big boss\u2019s desire to tell the story that GE was back in the business of getting bigger.  The overarching need to tell tales, at all costs, proved Immelt\u2019s undoing. His reliance on Beth Comstock, the chief marketing officer, and her belief that the company needed merely to \u201cpick a simple story\u2026and tell it again, and again, and again,\u201d helped lead the executive team to ignore facts and figures that got in the way. It also spawned stupid slogans like \u201cImagination at Work\u201d, which Immelt once declared was \u201ca reason for being\u201d. And it spawned a doomed effort to cast itself as America\u2019s oldest startup, with billions of dollars frittered away on its \u201cPredix\u201d software and data analytics project.  In the end, Immelt was gently shown the door and Flannery took his place, only to discover the truth behind the marketing mumbo jumbo. The company was largely meeting its numbers through legal, but stupid, financial chicanery that was starving the business of cash. He also found that GE\u2019s decision to spin off its insurance assets more than a decade before had left the company on the hook for some $15 billion. And so on.  As a dyed-in-the-wool GE guy, Flannery proved the wrong executive to fix what he and other Immelt acolytes had broken. He lasted just 14 months. But his decision to bring Larry Culp onto the board, and eventually make him the company\u2019s lead independent director, proved prescient. The no-nonsense, numbers-obsessed Culp was previously CEO of rival conglomerate Danaher, which today is worth nearly three times as much as GE.  When Culp took charge in 2018, he inherited a worse hand than Immelt received when replacing the legendary Jack Welch just before Sept. 11, 2001. But at least there is no longer any sense that Culp\u2019s mission will be to restore the conglomerate to its Welch-and-Immelt-era swagger. That story is over.","320":"Sept 11 (Reuters) - General Electric Co on Wednesday said it plans to reduce its ownership in oil and gas company Baker Hughes A GE Co to 38.4% from 50.4% at June-end, and aims to raise $2.7 billion in the process.

REUTERS\/Alwyn Scott  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Electric is getting a harsh lesson in the cost of credibility. A man who warned about Bernie Madoff\u2019s Ponzi scheme claims the conglomerate is hiding $38 billion in losses with false accounting. The company run by Larry Culp strongly denies it, but its history of opaque reports and belated write-offs put it on weak ground. The stock\u2019s more than 10% drop implies investors give the claims only partial credence \u2013 for now.  No company would welcome the attention of Harry Markopolos. The forensic accountant tried to warn the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission about Madoff\u2019s theft years before it came crashing down in December 2008. GE will find the scrutiny particularly uncomfortable.  Take the long-term care reinsurance business that GE\u2019s financial-services arm exited over a decade ago. The company took a $6.2 billion charge in 2017 to bolster insurance reserves because people are living longer and healthcare costs are rising. Markopolos claims GE should set aside another $29 billion, which the company disputes. It could take years to sort out the truth. But the SEC is investigating GE\u2019s reserving policies and the $22 billion write-down of its power business earlier this year, which makes dismissing the whistle-blower\u2019s claims difficult.  GE also rebutted Markopolos\u2019s contention that it should have taken an additional $9.1 billion hit when it sold a 12% stake in oil-services outfit Baker Hughes last November. That\u2019s not required, GE notes, because it remains the majority owner - just. But the company disclosed last month that any new sales would crystallize a $7.4 billion loss. Baker Hughes shares have since fallen nearly 17%, potentially magnifying the damage.  Culp has been working feverishly to revive GE since taking over last October, but unwinding decades of bad management and convoluted accounting is a job of years, not quarters. The company massaged earnings under former Chief Executive Jack Welch in the 1980s and \u201890s to consistently exceed analysts\u2019 estimates. Successor Jeff Immelt made disastrous acquisitions like France\u2019s Alstom.  A thin silver lining is that the $10 billion in value wiped out as of Thursday afternoon equates to barely a quarter of the pain Markopolos reckons may yet lie in store, implying investors aren\u2019t buying the whole story. But until Culp can make a clean break from the past, the company will remain vulnerable to skeptics like him and the short-sellers behind them.","339":"FILE PHOTO: The General Electric logo is pictured on the General Electric offshore wind turbine plant in Montoir-de-Bretagne, near Saint-Nazaire, western France, November 21, 2016.

The appointment comes weeks after the collapse of a planned aerospace alliance between Embraer and Boeing Co BA.N, which Slattery had defended, and marks what one observer referred to as a shift of culture as the industry faces its worst crisis.  GE\u2019s once-high-flying Aviation unit has been hit by the drop in air travel, adding to the toll from hundreds of grounded Boeing 737 MAX jetliners.

Joyce will then be non-executive chairman of GE Aviation through December 31.  GE shares were down 2.7% in early trading, underperforming a weaker market.  Industry sources had predicted Slattery would quit Embraer if the alliance with Boeing, for which he lobbied amid scepticism from European Union regulators, did not materialise.  Boeing terminated the deal in April, sparking an arbitration battle between the two companies.  Despite that spat, industry sources said Slattery has forged close relations with Boeing's management.

The new plant is designed to meet nearly half of the country\u2019s power demand.  \u201cThe selection of GE as Preferred Bidder puts Kosovo one step closer to achieving a successful outcome of the process that began long ago with the support of so many international institutions,\u201d Kosovo\u2019s economy minister Valdrin Lluka said in a statement.  \u201cSuccessful implementation of this project has the potential to reshape the overall economic perspective of the country,\u201d he added.  The other bidders for the project were China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC), South Korea\u2019s Hyundai and a consortium of Turkey\u2019s ENKA, Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems and Spain\u2019s Tecnicas Reunidas.  The project is valued at $1.3 billion, with financing expected to come from a mix of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and export credit agencies, ContourGlobal\u2019s CEO told Reuters in October.  Construction of the plant is expected to start later this year.  Currently around 90 percent of Kosovo\u2019s electricity is produced by two ailing coal-fired plants -- Kosova A and Kosova B -- which are among Europe\u2019s worst polluters.  Environmentalists have complained the new plant could lock Kosovo into a future powered by lignite \u2013 the dirtiest form of coal. However, the government said the new plant, which will replace Kosova A, would burn 40 percent less coal and release 20 times less emissions.  The World Bank last year said it would not back the project because it would use coal rather than renewable fuels.  The government has committed to buying the total output of the plant at a price yet to be determined.","343":"Nov 24 (Reuters) - General Electric Co warned employees of more job cuts at its aviation unit as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact commercial air travel, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing an internal video message.

GE said the warning about the potential action stems from a DOJ investigation and outcomes of investigations of other financial firms. GE said two years ago that the DOJ had issued subpoenas to WMC and GE Capital as part of an industry-wide investigation.  WMC, now a defunct subprime lending unit, was sold by GE in 2007.  GE declined to elaborate beyond the language in the filing.  The Boston-based conglomerate also said in the filing that it added 18,000 employees to its worldwide workforce last year, a 6.1 percent increase that comes as it tries to cut costs to raise profits.  GE said it had 313,000 employees at year-end, including 106,000 in the United States.  The increase stemmed from acquisitions made last year, including Baker Hughes BHGE.N and LM Wind Power, and was \"offset by divestitures and restructuring,\" GE spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said.  \u201cThe headcount figures at the end of 2017 do not reflect all of the restructuring that we\u2019ve announced previously,\u201d she added. \u201cSome of the restructuring projects take time to execute, so we\u2019ll continue to reduce headcount as we go forward.\u201d  GE said it had the ability to repatriate approximately $10 billion of non-U.S. cash without incremental federal income tax because of recent U.S. tax law changes.

GE said it expects industrial free cash flow to be at least $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter and positive in 2021.  Adjusted profit for the quarter came in at 6 cents per share compared with Refinitiv\u2019s average analyst estimate of a loss of 4 cents per share.  The company\u2019s shares, which have fallen about 40% since the beginning of 2020, were up about 10.3% at $7.83 in morning trading.  \u201cWe are managing through a still-difficult environment with better operational execution across our businesses,\u201d said Chief Executive Lawrence Culp.  Culp is trying to turn around the company by improving free cash flow and cutting debt. However, the coronavirus pandemic has hit those efforts by hammering GE\u2019s aviation unit, usually the company\u2019s most profitable and most cash-generative segment.  In response to the pandemic-induced turmoil, GE is cutting $2 billion in costs and aiming to generate $3 billion in cash savings. The company said it has, thus far, realized 75% of its target.  Chief Financial Officer Carolina Dybeck Happe told investors on an earnings call that the company has thus far reduced its headcount by more than 15,000 and aims to have 20,000 fewer employees by the end of 2020 as part of its cost-cut drive.  Revenue at both power and renewable energy businesses recovered from the last quarter even as orders saw a double-digit dip. Revenue at GE\u2019s aviation unit fell an annual 39% in the latest quarter.  Analysts at Gordon Haskett Research Advisors said the earnings report would \u201creinforce the messaging that GE has fundamentally bottomed.\u201d  However, a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases has raised the risk of prolonging the downturn in the aviation industry, which has led to a sharp cutback in maintenance spending by airlines, hitting both large and small suppliers.  This has compounded the troubles at GE's aviation unit, which makes engines for Boeing Co BA.N and Airbus SE AIR.PA and had already been reeling from the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX planes.  Happe said aviation orders more than halved during the quarter, with a 60% decline in both commercial engines and commercial services.  Boeing on Wednesday said it would take three years for passenger travel to return to pre-pandemic levels.  GE said an annual test of reserves in its legacy insurance business resulted in a \u201csmall positive margin\u201d with no impact to earnings.  Mounting losses related to the company\u2019s run-off insurance operations - a portfolio of about 300,000 long-term care insurance policies it holds in its GE Capital unit - forced the company to take a $6.2 billion charge in 2018 and put aside $15 billion in reserves to shore it up.  The insurance charge also brought scrutiny from securities regulators. Earlier this month, GE warned that it could face a civil action for possible violations of securities laws over its accounting for the insurance business.  GE said it has reserved $100 million to cover potential penalties for all the accounting investigations. Happe said the amount was \u201cappropriate\u201d to cover the probes.","350":"FILE PHOTO: The General Electric Co. logo is seen on the company's corporate headquarters building in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. July 23, 2019.

FILE PHOTO: A General Electric (GE) sign is seen at the second China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai, China November 6, 2019.

Shares surged 10.2% to $12.92 in afternoon trading.  GE on Wednesday also said it would slash 737 MAX engine deliveries to Boeing Co BA.N roughly in half this year. But it still set a higher cash target for 2020 of $2 billion to $4 billion - above the $3 billion analysts expect on average. That helped fuel the share rise, said William Baird analyst Nick Heymann, who said the new target marked a confident step up from GE's 2019 target of $0 to $2 billion in cash.  GE\u2019s 2020 adjusted profit forecast, at 50 cents to 60 cents a share, was less than the 66-cent Wall Street average forecast. But much of the future depends on how events play out with the 737 MAX, the company said.  Culp said on a conference call that GE will slow production of its LEAP 1-B engine for the 737 MAX, but will keep its line running to protect suppliers and prepare for increasing engine output in the second half of the year.  Boeing plans on the jet going back in service at airlines in the second half of 2020, and GE\u2019s forecasts rest on that timing, Culp said. GE plans a deeper outlook discussion for March 4.  Meanwhile, GE is trying to tackle its problems by increasing \u201coperational rigor\u201d and lean manufacturing, Culp stressed on the call, suggesting simple measures such as calling on customers and collecting bills will improve performance.

Free cash flow from industrial operations was $3.9 billion in the fourth quarter, beating analysts estimates of $3.4 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  GE\u2019s cash flow typically surges in the fourth quarter as workers rush to ship units and book orders by year-end.  Culp has vowed to smooth cash more evenly across the year, but \u201cthe expectation was that this will still be an outsized cash flow quarter,\u201d said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray.  In GE\u2019s power division, revenue fell 16% in the year and orders fell 25%, mainly due to the \u201cnon-repeat\u201d of large orders last year, GE said.  In aviation, GE\u2019s largest unit by revenue, orders rose 3% and revenue rose 8% in the year. The unit was, ironically, helped by the MAX grounding since its engines earn little or no profit and not delivering them improves margins, analysts said.  GE reported $2.3 billion in organic industrial free cash flow for 2019, topping its 2019 target. More than $800 million of the cash came from spending only $1.2 billion on restructuring last year, after originally planning to spend more than $2 billion.  \u201cTechnically, cash is getting better, but much of the gains come from reducing earlier guidance on costs,\u201d said John Inch, analyst at Gordon Haskett in New York.

A worker walks past a gas turbine under construction at the gas turbines production unit of the General Electric plant in Belfort, June 24, 2014. REUTERS\/Vincent Kessler\/File Photo  The shutdowns, which follow a recent GE turbine blade failure in Texas, come as GE grapples with financial losses and a drop in orders for the massive generators that can supply electricity to hundreds of thousands of homes.  GE is setting aside $480 million to repair its 9HA, 7HA and 9FB model turbines as it restructures its power business. The 126-year-old conglomerate has declined to say how many have been shut down, or when it would replace parts - if needed - in as many as 130 such turbines it has produced.  Power plant operators in Japan, Taiwan, France and at multiple U.S. sites have shut down - or plan to shut down - at least 18 of the 55 new HA-model turbines that GE has shipped so far, French utility data and interviews with more than 20 industry experts, including executives, plant operators, insurance specialists, engineers and consultants with direct knowledge of GE turbines show.  In an interview, GE gas power systems CEO Chuck Nugent played down the significance of turbine shutdowns and the French data, saying that GE turbines are performing \u201cextremely well,\u201d despite the need for \u201cearly maintenance\u201d to fix the blades.  Considering all of the power turbines it has in use, GE has \u201cthe most reliable fleet in the world - 99 percent, give or take, reliability,\u201d he added.  GE previously disclosed that its equipment needing blade repairs includes four 7HA turbines in Texas that were shut after oxidation caused a blade to fail in one of them in September. Those turbines are included in the 18 being shut down.  Photographs of the damaged turbine reviewed by Reuters show dozens of jagged and broken blades inside the massive machine, owned by Exelon Corp EXC.N. The turbines are now running after two months of repairs, Exelon said.  GE told Reuters it identified the oxidation problem in 2015, and developed a fix before the failure in Texas. The fix uses an earlier casting method that was employed on other turbine models.  Three plant operators using GE equipment that are shutting for blade repairs, Invenergy, Exelon and Tennessee Valley Authority, told Reuters GE has been transparent and responsive in installing new blades for free under warranty.  \u201cOverall, we\u2019ve been very pleased with GE\u2019s HA technology and its performance capabilities,\u201d said Beth Conley, a spokeswoman at Invenergy, which is receiving replacement blades for three new HA turbines at a Pennsylvania plant that has not yet opened.  Following the problems in Texas, state-owned utility Electricite de France EDF.PA closed its plant in the northern French town of Bouchain for a month starting in late September for blade replacements. Bouchain was the first plant worldwide to install GE's 9HA turbine.  Bouchain has logged 86 outages for equipment failure, testing or other reasons from January 2017 to October 2018, five times the average for non-GE plants, according to data from French grid operator RTE analyzed by Reuters. Reuters excluded outages for planned maintenance.  The French data also show that plants with GE turbines have closed for repairs or testing, on average, more than twice as often as non-GE gas-fueled plants in France with turbines made by Alstom, Siemens AG SIEGn.DE and Ansaldo Energia SpA. GE acquired Alstom's power business in 2015.  GE and EDF officials told Reuters that the data from grid operator RTE, an independent subsidiary of EDF, are \u201cnot wrong,\u201d but should not be used to assess turbine performance because some outages might be due to other equipment at the plants.  EDF said there are no problems at Bouchain, which opened in 2016, and that frequent shutdowns are not unusual for new plants during their break-in period. EDF said Bouchain\u2019s output is cycled up and down to meet peaks in electricity demand rather than running constantly. The other gas-fired plants tracked by RTE also can be used for peaking and have been in operation for many years.  RTE, Siemens AG SIEGn.DE, Ansaldo Energia SpA and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems 7011.T declined to comment.  Reuters could not obtain comparable data on how often GE\u2019s turbines shut down for repair at utilities around the world. Shutdowns are triggered when utilities determine that a plant needs to be serviced or tested, or when equipment failure or other problems cause the plant to shut down unexpectedly.  While GE plants still produce a third of the world\u2019s electricity, GE fell from first to third place in new turbine orders by capacity, behind Mitsubishi and Siemens, according to a first-half tally by McCoy Power Reports, a widely watched industry data source.  GE said it booked seven HA turbine orders in the first nine months of this year, half as many as in the same period last year.  GE\u2019s HA turbines have come under particular pressure and its plant repair business is facing growing competition. The success of GE\u2019s new turbines are of increasing importance as it slims down to focus on power plants, jet engines and wind turbines in a flurry of restructuring. GE spent more than two decades developing the 400-ton machines, but brought them to market after rivals Siemens and Mitsubishi were gaining market share, forcing GE to catch up.  GE undercut its rivals\u2019 prices by about 20 percent \u201cto go from 0 percent to about 45 percent share of this turbine class by 2016,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts said in a report this year.  Now Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp is battling to restore GE\u2019s profit and slash debt after the company lost $22.8 billion last quarter, mostly from its power unit, and its credit rating fell to just three notches above junk. Culp is splitting up the power division, consolidating its power headquarters to cut costs and has named new leaders for it.  Demand for large gas turbines is at a 23-year low, forcing GE and rivals to fight hard for fewer deals as utilities buy more wind and solar systems that have become cost competitive.  Scott Strazik, the new chief executive of GE Gas Power, said in an interview that customers are happy with GE\u2019s response to the blade issue and GE has no plans to change how it handles customer issues, or how it tests turbines, noting GE\u2019s test facility is the largest and most comprehensive in the world.  \u201cThe HA is the fastest-selling gas turbine that we have, and customers continue to have a strong desire for the HA,\u201d Strazik said.","355":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Union leaders plan to meet with General Electric Co on Wednesday in a bid to avert closure of a Virginia factory that makes controls for GE\u2019s power plants, the company and the union said on Tuesday.

A GE email sent to the union last week said volume at the plant had fallen 35 percent in the past two years and that the facility was operating at about 40 percent of capacity.  The email also cited price competition in the shrunken power-plant market. \u201cProduct cost continues to be a major influencer when customers are selecting their next controls solution,\u201d it said.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cThe sweet number is $650 million in industrial free cash flow\u201d in the quarter, said Nick Heymann, an analyst at William Baird and Co in New York, who expected $400 to $500 million.  GE now needs to generate about $2.6 billion of cash in the fourth quarter to meet the midpoint of its new forecast, said John Inch, analyst at Gordon Haskett in New York, about half what GE generated in the same quarter last year.  \u201cThis seems plausible, but hardly robust \u2013 regardless of the company\u2019s cash guidance \u2018raise,\u2019\u201d Inch said in a note.  While GE\u2019s adjusted results beat expectations, GE\u2019s report showed difficulty in key business lines, and Culp said the remains plenty of \u201cwork to do.\u201d  Orders at GE\u2019s ailing power division fell 30%, and orders for GE\u2019s gas-powered turbines fell 17%. GE said it shipped five of its newest and largest HA gas turbines in the third quarter, after shipping just one in the first half. Power revenue, which includes gas, steam and nuclear equipment and services, fell 14% in the quarter.  Jet engine orders fell 27%, while engine service orders rose 15%. GE said it took a $300-million cash hit in the quarter from the grounding of Boeing Co's BA.N 737 MAX jetliner, which uses engines partly made by GE. Culp said he does not expect the grounding to end this year.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The grounding, after a second fatal crash of the plane last March, means Boeing cannot deliver the jets to airlines, and GE therefore is not yet being paid for the engines it delivers, according to analysts. GE said it expects a similar hit of $400 million in the fourth quarter. Those numbers were in line with expectations GE set at the end of July.  GE took an $8.7-billion charge for reducing its stake in Baker Hughes to less than 50% in the quarter, a change that required GE to stop consolidating the oil and gas company\u2019s earnings in GE\u2019s results and to mark the remaining stake to fair value. Analysts had expected a charge up to $10 billion.  GE took a $1 billion charge for its long-term care insurance business to account for the effect of falling interest rates on its obligations. The charge was about what analysts expected.  GE also wrote off $740 million in goodwill for its hydro power business. Together, the insurance and goodwill charges amounted to 17 cents of EPS, GE said.  On an adjusted basis, which excludes such charges, GE earned 15 cents per share, compared with 11 cents analysts expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Total revenue fell slightly to $23.36 billion from $23.39 billion.","357":"July 29 (Reuters) - General Electric Co:  * GENERAL ELECTRIC CO SAYS SAW SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT IN BUSINESS IN JUNE AND JULY- CONF.

For years, the United States has supported American companies\u2019 business with China\u2019s budding civil aviation industry.  The U.S. government has provided licenses that allow those companies to sell engines, flight control systems and other components for China\u2019s first large commercial aircraft, the COMAC C919. The narrow-body jet has already engaged in test flights and is expected to go into service next year. COMAC is an acronym for Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd.  But the Trump administration is weighing whether to deny GE\u2019s latest license request to provide the CFM LEAP-1C engine for the C919, people familiar with the matter said, though GE has received licenses for the LEAP engines since 2014 and was last granted one in March 2019.  The CFM LEAP engine is a joint venture between GE and France\u2019s Safran Aircraft Engines. The proposal to halt the deliveries of the engines was also reported on Saturday by the Wall Street Journal.  The possible new restrictions on sales of aircraft parts would be the latest move in a deepening battle between the United States and China over technological dominance.

FILE PHOTO: The General Electric logo is pictured on the General Electric offshore wind turbine plant in Montoir-de-Bretagne, near Saint-Nazaire, western France, November 21, 2016. REUTERS\/Stephane Mahe\/File Photo  The maker of power plants, jet engines, medical devices and other industrial goods had estimated the after-tax, non-cash impact would be about $4.2 billion, plus reduced earnings for 2016 and 2017 of about 29 cents a share.  The accounting change prompted GE to recast two years of past financial statements to reflect lower income and asset values under the new standard, and those will be reflected when GE reports first-quarter results on April 20.  The value of GE\u2019s contract assets are being written down, but that does not change the value of the long-term contracts GE has, nor does it affect GE\u2019s cash flow or earnings estimates for 2018, GE said.  The adjustments appear within expectations, Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said. \u201cNow the focus moves to next Friday\u2019s earnings.\u201d  The figures suggest GE executives have gotten to the bottom of some accounting issues and bolster confidence in Chief Executive Officer John Flannery after a series of financial surprises, including underestimating the impact of insurance policies that prompted a $6.2 billion charge in the fourth quarter, analysts said.  GE shares were down 1 percent at $13.35 in aftermarket trading after rising 2.4 percent on Friday.  The new accounting standard governs how companies estimate and recognize revenue from long-term contracts, and is designed to make a company\u2019s cash flow more closely match its income, accounting experts and analysts said.  The prior standard allowed companies to recognize future revenue from such agreements more quickly. The new standard shifts revenue to later in the contract duration, analysts said.  Companies typically use the cost of providing services as a basis for estimating future revenue from the contracts, but the process can lead to over- or under-estimating the value of the contracts as assets on the balance sheet, experts say.  GE\u2019s contract asset tally has soared 70 percent to $28.8 billion in 2017, from $16.9 billion in 2014, most of it in its power and aviation units. The majority of the total reflects revenue GE has already booked but for which it has not billed customers, which creates the gap between profit and cash flow, according to GE\u2019s regulatory filings.  GE also made adjustments for new accounting standards for pensions, cash flow and taxes on Friday.  GE\u2019s accounting is under scrutiny after earnings swung to a loss last year and GE said its 2018 results would be at the low end of its forecasted range of between $1.00 and $1.07 a share.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into GE\u2019s accounting for contract assets, raising investor concern but GE has said it is not overly concerned about the investigation.  GE said in February that it expects to make the adjustments as it switches to the new accounting standards for contracts.  GE said it chose to restate 2016 and 2017 earnings, a more exacting standard under the new rules, because it will allow investors to compare 2018 results with the prior years.","365":"April 30 (Reuters) - General Electric Co reported a more than three-fold rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday, helped by higher sales in its aviation, oil and gas, and healthcare units.

REUTERS\/Stephane Mahe\/File Photo  (Reuters) - U.S. industrial conglomerate General Electric GE.N has reached a deal to sell parts of its overseas lighting business to a company controlled by former executive Joerg Bauer for an undisclosed amount.  Bauer most recently served as President of GE Hungary where GE Lighting\u2019s Europe, Middle East, Africa and Turkey business is headquartered, the company said in an emailed statement.  The deal, which marks the first step in the divesture of the lighting business, includes GE Lighting in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Turkey, along with its Global Automotive Lighting businesses.  The remaining pieces of GE Lighting, as well as the Current, will now be marketed as part of a separate sale or sales, the company also added.  The lighting business dates to the earliest days of GE, which was co-founded by Thomas Edison more than a century ago.  GE has been preparing to sell the lighting business, as part of a broad restructuring plan aimed at shedding $20 billion worth of assets and focus the remaining company on three core divisions: power, aviation and health care.  Profit fell sharply at GE\u2019s lighting business last year. It earned $93 million on revenue of nearly $2 billion in 2017, down from $199 million on $4.8 billion in 2016.  GE Chief Executive John Flannery last month said the conglomerate was looking at restructuring options \u201cincluding separately traded assets\u201d after it announced more than $11 billion in charges from its long-term care insurance portfolio and new U.S. tax laws.  The Wall Street Journal had earlier reported the sale.","373":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Vistra Energy Corp VST.N and Dominion Energy Inc D.N \u2013 which serve about 5.5 million electricity customers in more than a dozen U.S. states \u2013 both say they are done building combined-cycle natural gas-fired power plants.  Instead, they are building large solar plants, which offer plentiful and inexpensive electricity.  This bearish view of fossil-fuel energy, reflective of a growing acceptance by utilities of renewable power sources, poses a hurdle to John Flannery's plan to turn around General Electric Co's GE.N $35 billion-a-year power unit.  GE\u2019s chief executive spelled out the difficulty on Wednesday. Power profits will be flat this year after falling 53 percent in 2017, he said, and GE is planning that demand for heavy-duty natural gas power plants will be less than half what it forecast just over a year ago, and will stay at that level through 2020.  New plant sales are \u201cgoing to be tough,\u201d Flannery said at an investor conference on Wednesday. \u201cThis is not going to be a quick fix, but there is, at the end of the day, long-life assets here with intrinsic economic value. We\u2019re going to make the most of what we have there.\u201d  In the long run, Flannery and Russell Stokes, the head of GE Power, have said demand for electricity and natural gas power generators will grow about 2 percent a year - in line with global forecasts - as utilities make a gradual transition to renewable power.  Following a strategy he laid out in November, Flannery is cutting 12,000 jobs and $2.5 billion in costs at the unit. On Wednesday, he said GE has tripled some sales incentives in the power division and is competing aggressively for new contracts to maintain plants and to get the call when utilities need parts or repairs during an unexpected outage, something of which GE had lost sight.  But some analysts and investors are skeptical about the long-term prospects of a business devoted to natural gas and coal power plants that are falling out of favor with utilities.  The competition from solar and wind, along with abundant low-priced gas produced by fracking, is curbing orders for new plants and forcing the closure of old ones. Some utilities are even filing for bankruptcy.  \u201cThat means companies are going to have trouble selling new fossil-fuel plants,\u201d said Mark Dyson, a principal at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an organization that researches the power industry.  Over 126 years, GE has weathered ups and downs in power market before, and has legions of sales and service people around the world. Last year it booked 26 orders for its newest gas turbines in Mexico, Bangladesh and elsewhere. It is investing in its separate, $10 billion-a-year renewables unit focused on wind and hydro, which saw revenue fall 6 percent last year. GE also sells battery storage, software and smart-grid technology to work with wind and solar systems.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  GE power equipment orders - an indicator of future sales - fell 41 percent in the first quarter, accelerating from a 17 percent drop last year, according to GE\u2019s earnings reports.  GE\u2019s performance reflects the broader trend of utilities shifting to renewables from fossil fuels.  Global sales of large natural gas power plants have fallen by half since 2013, according to McCoy Power Reports. Coal and gas-fired plants accounted for just 38 percent of new electricity capacity financed globally last year, down from 71 percent a decade ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. Solar and wind now draw 53 percent of such investment, up from 22 percent, a Reuters analysis shows.  Rivals Siemens AG SIEGn.DE and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 7011.T are cautious about the scope for growth.  \u201cWe see a structural change,\u201d Lisa Davis, the chief executive officer of Siemens Corp, the U.S. unit, said in an interview. \u201cThere are fewer large units being sold globally than there were five years ago. I don\u2019t see that changing dramatically going forward.\u201d  Siemens is cutting 6,100 power and gas jobs to adjust.  Many utilities share the view that the shift is permanent because it is driven by economics rather than government policy and climate-change concerns. While conventional power plants will continue to be built, sales may never reach the levels seen just two years ago, industry experts said.  With electricity prices trending downward, utilities are increasingly unwilling to risk capital on a new plant unless then can lock in a long-term price, executives said.  \u201cBuilding new large, combined-cycle gas plants is challenging without the stability of a long-term power contract,\u201d said Timothy Menzie, chief executive officer of InterGen, an international power generation company.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  POWER PLAYER  GE faces a further challenge: long-term erosion of the large base of plants it services. After acquiring the Alstom power business in 2015, GE has a base of customers that produces one-third of the world\u2019s electricity. Long-term contracts to service those plants bring GE billions of dollars in annual revenue.  But as utilities close older coal and gas-fired plants, the revenue growth from services is under pressure.  Wind and solar can cost as little as $18 a megawatt hour, compared with $40 for a large gas plant, said Mikael Backman, North America regional director at Wartsila WRT1V.HE Energy Solutions, part of the Finnish company that makes quick-start natural gas-fired generators.  Across much of the United States, some utilities now buy all the cheap renewable power they can on electricity markets and use quick-start gas engines to fill in when wind and sun falter.  In California, regulators have put on hold a project that planned to buy one of GE\u2019s large natural-gas turbines while Southern California Edison, which planned to buy the power, studies using wind and solar instead.  The shift from fossil fuels stretches beyond states like California, which is aggressively switching to renewable power.  In oil-rich Texas, wind and solar now provide 21 percent of the state\u2019s electricity. Utilities there are shutting down the equivalent of about 20 average-sized coal plants this year, according a Reuters analysis of data from power system operator ERCOT. Out of 183 power-generation projects on the drawing boards, only four would run on fossil fuels, ERCOT said. The rest are wind and solar.  ExGen Texas Power, an affiliate of Exelon Corp EXC.N, filed for bankruptcy protection in November for five natural-gas plants, the second such bankruptcy in Texas last year attributed to low power prices. GE supplied parts and service to several of the plants, according to the bankruptcy filings. Reuters could not determine whether the contracts will remain in effect.  In Virginia, Dominion Energy ended several maintenance contracts it had with GE this year when it mothballed a large gas-fired plant built by companies GE later acquired and idled seven other coal and natural gas units in the state.  Dominion aims to build 4,720 megawatts of solar by 2033, the equivalent of about five large combined-cycle power plants.  It is opening a new combined-cycle natural-gas plant in Virginia this year, built with GE and Mitsubishi equipment.

The White House and the U.S. Commerce Department, which issues licenses for such exports, declined to comment, as did a GE spokeswoman. The departments of Defense, State, Energy and Treasury did not respond to requests for comment.  For years, the United States has supported American companies\u2019 business with China\u2019s budding civil aviation industry.  The government has provided licenses that allow those companies to sell engines, flight control systems and other components for China\u2019s first large commercial aircraft, the COMAC C919. The narrow-body jet has already engaged in test flights and is expected to go into service next year. COMAC is an acronym for Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd.  But the Trump administration is weighing whether to deny GE\u2019s latest license request to provide the CFM LEAP-1C engine for the C919, people familiar with the matter said, though GE has received licenses for the LEAP engines since 2014 and was last granted one in March 2019.  The CFM LEAP engine is a joint venture between GE and France\u2019s Safran Aircraft Engines. The proposal to halt the deliveries of the engines was also reported on Saturday by the Wall Street Journal.  Safran did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and French government officials could not be reached for comment.  Aside from aircraft engines, flight control systems are up for discussion at the February meetings. Honeywell International has received licenses to export flight control systems to COMAC for the C919 for about a decade, and one was approved in early 2020, according to a person familiar with the matter.  But future permission for such sales for COMAC\u2019s passenger aircrafts may be up for debate. Honeywell also has been seeking a license for flight control technology to participate in the development of the C929, China\u2019s planned wide-body jet venture with Russia, the person said.  The flight control system operates moving mechanical parts, such as the wing flaps, from the cockpit.  A spokeswoman for Honeywell declined to comment.  An aerospace trade group official said his organization would like to weigh in on any policy shifts.  \u201cIf there are any changes, we would hope they would engage with us, as they\u2019ve done before,\u201d said Remy Nathan, vice president for international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association.  At the heart of the debate over a possible crackdown on the sale of U.S. parts to China\u2019s nascent aircraft industry is whether such shipments would fuel the rise of a serious competitor to U.S.-based Boeing Co or boost China\u2019s military capabilities.  People familiar with the matter said some administration officials are concerned the Chinese could reverse engineer some items, though others say an abundance of LEAP engines in China has not brought that about to date.  If the United States were to move ahead with the measure, one person familiar with the matter said, China could retaliate by ordering more planes from Airbus SE, rather than crisis-hit Boeing, which relies on China for a fourth its deliveries.  The Trump administration\u2019s meetings about technology issues also are set to include a discussion of whether to impose further restrictions on suppliers to Huawei Technologies, the world\u2019s largest telecommunications equipment maker, which is on a U.S. trade blacklist.","378":"Feb 14 (Reuters) - General Electric Co:  * GE SAYS CHIEF COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER AND SENIOR ADVISOR, DEIRDRE LATOUR, TO LEAVE CO  * GE SAYS LINDA BOFF, CMO AND CHIEF LEARNING OFFICER, NAMED INTERIM HEAD OF COMMUNICATIONS Source text : [bit.ly\/2GfkePF] Further company coverage:","379":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of U.S. conglomerate General Electric is seen on the company building in Belfort, France, October 19, 2019.

The job cuts are the latest mounting woes for the aviation sector that are now expected to last into 2021 as U.S. passenger air travel demand has fallen by 95%.  Last week, Boeing Co BA.N said it would cut 10% of its global workforce, or 16,000 jobs, as it has slowed some production rates, while supplier SpiritAero Systems Holdings SPR.N said on Friday it is cutting another 1,450 jobs in Kansas.  GE shares were down 4% on at $6.23.  The GE Aviation job cuts are part of the $3 billion in cost and cash savings announced by the company last month and include previously announced cuts, including a 10% cut to its U.S. workforce announced in March.  GE Aviation Chief Executive David Joyce told employees on Monday the \u201cdeep contraction of commercial aviation is unprecedented, affecting every customer worldwide. Global traffic is expected to be down approximately 80% in the second quarter.\u201d  GE Aviation previously issued furloughs impacting about 50% of its U.S. maintenance, repair and overhaul employees and new engine manufacturing. It also imposed a hiring freeze, canceled a salaried merit increase and dramatically reduced non-essential spending.  Neither GE nor Boeing opted to apply for government assistance from a $17 billion U.S. Treasury fund for national security related companies. Boeing said it would rely on $25 billion raised in a new bond offering.  Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said last week he expects it will \u201ctake two to three years for travel to return to 2019 levels and it will be a few years beyond that for the industry to return to long-term growth trends.\u201d","380":"(Corrects title of CFO in 5th paragraph)  NEW YORK, Oct 30 (Reuters) - General Electric Co is not forecasting the Boeing Co 737 MAX jetliner will return to service this year, GE Chief Executive Larry Culp said during a conference call on quarterly earnings on Wednesday.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of U.S. conglomerate General Electric is seen on the company building in Belfort, France, October 19, 2019. REUTERS\/Vincent Kessler  The new loans, that will come at the reduced size of US$15bn, are a testament to a changing bank landscape as firms seek to get better compensated for the risk they take to lend as volatility rattles the markets.  A shorter commitment window of three years bodes well for the banks lending to the multinational conglomerate at a time when liquidity is golden.  JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, BNP Paribas, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley lead the GE loans.  \u201cDuring times of volatility, banks prefer to be out with a three-year loan, and not a five-year loan. A shorter-term maturity is going to be less risky,\u201d a banking source said.  The reduced financing size was agreed to at the onset of the discussions with banks and before the coronavirus fears rattled the markets.  \u201cGE has divested a number of assets. The loans are more in line with GE\u2019s current size,\u201d a source close to the company said.  The shorter-dated loan, however, is also better for banks as longer-term capital is more expensive, especially for those institutions that borrow overnight to fund themselves.  The Basel II and Basel III capital agreements monitor the minimum capital that banks need to hold as a cushion against insolvency. The accords require banks to hold capital against the funded and unfunded revolving credit lines they provide to their corporate clients.  During times of uncertainty, unlike the bond market that offers prepayment penalties to banks, lenders in the loan market prefer shorter-dated commitments.  \u201cThe loan market wants to go shorter because banks are very uncomfortable with their own cost of liquidity,\u201d a second banking source said.  In recent days, better-rated companies such as General Motors, Ford Motor Co, Anheuser-Busch InBev and Petrobras opted to hoard liquidity as they borrowed from revolving credit lines that they usually leave untapped.  According to JP Morgan, by March 27 there had been US$227bn in revolver drawdowns. And although liquidity is yet to be impacted, more drawdowns are expected to follow.  The banks\u2019 inability to repay its liabilities with sufficiently liquid assets is considered to be a large cause of the financial crisis.  JP Morgan, Citi, BNP and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. BAML and Goldman did not return immediate requests to comment.  GE\u2019S DEAL  To replace US$20bn in loans set to expire in 2021, GE was originally looking to do a three-year and a five-year loan. But given the uncertainty in the market, only a shorter-date financing was available.  \u201cAs part of our normal financial management process, we are refinancing a back-up credit facility that expires in 2021. Our financial position is sound, including US$20bn of cash proceeds from closing the sale of BioPharma on March 31,\u201d a GE spokesperson said in a emailed statement to Refinitiv LPC.  The financing, that launched early this week, is expected to price higher than the existing loan.  GE is now looking to pay 15bp undrawn and 137.5bp over Libor when the facility is drawn for a three-year loan.  GE originally paid 10bp undrawn on the five-year and 9bp undrawn on the three-year portion.  \u201cGE is obviously a company with a big bank following and a big wallet and their shrinking the deal size so the expectation is that it will go okay. Everyone is watching,\u201d the second banking source said.  With significant exposure to the energy and transportation sectors, lending to GE is now a tougher ask for banks, the second banking source said.  The company recently announced its plans to lay off 10% of its US workers at its aviation unit amid COVID-19 hits to air travel and aircraft demand. The company has also logged significant losses in its energy division.","383":"FILE PHOTO: A traffic light is seen in front of a logo of General Electric at the company's plant in Birr, Switzerland June 17, 2019.

GE set a forecast for first-quarter earnings of about 10 cents a share on Wednesday, including the virus impact.  The company expects to generate $2 billion to $4 billion of industrial free cash flow in 2020, Chief Executive Larry Culp said.  \u201cWe decidedly did not take a view and would not necessarily encourage any extrapolations from what we\u2019ve said here in the first quarter simply because what we don\u2019t know outweighs what we do know at this point,\u201d Culp said on a conference call with analysts. \u201cIt\u2019s a volatile, fluid situation, unpredictable in many respects.\u201d  The Boston-based maker of jet engines, power plants and other industrial equipment employs thousands in China. It is considered vulnerable to economic weakness caused by the virus which has cooled the world\u2019s second-largest economy and disrupted global supply chains.

General Electric CEO John Flannery is seen at the company\u2019s office in New York City, U.S., June 26, 2018. REUTERS\/Alwyn Scott  GE\u2019s message to dealmakers: Not so fast.  The company is wedded to a plan it outlined Tuesday to sell 20 percent of its healthcare unit and distribute the other 80 percent to shareholders through a tax-efficient spinoff, people familiar with management\u2019s thinking said.  Tax concerns make GE wary of entertaining other options for its healthcare business, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations.  A provision related to the majority stake GE owns in oil-services company Baker Hughes led to the plan it announced on Tuesday to gradually sell the stake down over 2-3 years, they said.  In an interview, GE Chief Executive Officer John Flannery would not rule out selling the healthcare unit or the Baker Hughes stake, but said the company intends to have them both trade publicly so GE shareholders can still benefit from future growth.  \u201cOur intention is to take it out as a stand-alone company,\u201d Flannery told Reuters when asked if a sale was a possibility. \u201cMy world view is there\u2019s no such thing as ruling out any option, but that\u2019s not our intention,  \u201cWe want to get these out into shareholders hands where they can grow more quickly.\u201d  GE\u2019s slow-and-steady divestiture plan tracks the approach it has taken under Flannery who took the helm last August.  For instance, when GE announced plans to sell its transportation business to Wabtec in an $11.1 billion last month, it kept a chunk of the business for itself and shareholders.  The company is open to smaller divestitures, and several are in process, including GE\u2019s lighting division, parts of its project finance unit Energy Financial Services, its aerospace parts group Middle River, and its offshore positioning systems unit Converteam.  Those transactions will only generate between $1 billion and $3 billion each, people familiar with the businesses said. Altogether, GE will probably generate another $5 billion or so in cash through more marginal deals.  The most problematic asset GE is trying to sell is its insurance business, which has incurred hefty charges, sparked shareholder lawsuits, and an investigation by U.S. regulators. Insurance liabilities stood at $38 billion at the end of 2017, according to GE\u2019s annual report, though it is unclear how such a deal would be structured or valued, bankers said.  TWO GEMS  There is already interest in GE\u2019s two gems \u2013 its healthcare unit and Baker Hughes \u2013 but each has complications preventing an outright sale.  In April, medical equipment maker Danaher Corp approached GE about potentially acquiring the life sciences division of its healthcare unit, a major source of sales that makes X-ray machines and hospital equipment, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The Wall Street Journal first reported Danaher\u2019s approach.  GE did not entertain talks at the time and remains unconvinced that any offer would be able to match how much the tax-efficient spinoff will earn for shareholders, the person said.  Another acquirer that could express interest in the healthcare unit is Thermo Fisher Scientific, according to a separate person familiar with the matter.  But GE plans to put roughly $18 billion of debt and pension obligations on the spinoff company, something that could dampen enthusiasm among potential buyers.  For Baker Hughes, instead of an outright sale, GE will likely either hold an initial public offering or organize numerous block trades of shares to institutional investors.  The company plans to stick to a lockup agreement it struck when acquiring the stake to remain a co-owner at least until 2019, the people said. Although the oil-services industry has come under pressure from falling commodity prices, GE sees potential in the business from cost cuts and growing customer relationships, they said.  Even if GE wanted to find a single buyer for the stake, it would be tough.  The only two strategic buyers, Schlumberger NV and Halliburton Co, would face major antitrust challenges, analysts said. Plus, there are few players out there with the resources to acquire the huge stake, worth $22 billion on Tuesday.","394":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Utilities are shutting down at least 18 of General Electric Co's GE.N newest gas turbines for repairs at power plants from Taiwan to France, according to more than a dozen interviews with plant operators and industry experts.

Two months ago another turbine made by GE collapsed in Brazil when its tower broke in half.

Omega said it was working with GE to discover the cause of the accident.  RDS Energia, a Brazilian consultancy that develops wind farm projects, said this type of accident was unusual, since towers and turbines are designed to resist winds of up to 300 km (186 miles) per hour.  RDS head Rodrigo Nereu dos Santos said a repeat of such accidents could have an impact on GE\u2019s image and potentially hurt its chances in future tenders to supply equipment.  GE has sold more than 3,000 turbines for wind farms in Brazil, accounting for around 5.5 gigawatts of generating capacity. Brazil has currently 15 gigawatts in wind power capacity, accounting for about 9% of its electricity generation.

Oilfield services firms are seeking to tighten their focus to their core operations, as oil prices continue their recovery from their January 2016 lows.  Baker Hughes\u2019 unit for sale, which makes sensors and monitors for industrial clients such as petrochemical makers and power generators, is expected to attract interest from other manufacturers of such devices, according to one of the sources.  The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Baker Hughes declined to comment.  Oilfield service firms are still rebounding from the 2014-2016 crude price crash, which prompted mass layoffs and cost cutting across the sector. Although oil prices have now climbed to above $60 a barrel, many firms remain under pressure as exploration and production companies continue to slash service costs.  In December, Baker Hughes rival Weatherford International Plc WFT.N sold its stake in a North American pressure pumping and well operations joint venture to partner Schlumberger SLB.N for $430 million in a bid to raise cash and pay down debt.

FILE PHOTO: The General Electric Co. logo is seen on the company's corporate headquarters building in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. July 23, 2019. REUTERS\/Alwyn Scott  GE\u2019s shares were down 1.2% at $11.25 in post-market trade following the news.  Securities regulators opened a probe into the company\u2019s accounting practices following a 2017 surprise accounting charge of $6.2 billion by the company, which said it would need to set aside $15 billion for long-term care insurance payouts at the time.  The inquiry, which initially focused on long-term service agreements for maintenance of power plants, jet engines and other industrial equipment, was later expanded to include GE\u2019s review of its insurance business.  As part of the settlement, GE has also agreed to report to the SEC for a one-year period about compliance related to its power business and GE Capital\u2019s run-off insurance operations.  A GE representative said the settlement has brought the SEC\u2019s investigation to a close, and no corrections or revisions to its financial statements are required.  The representative said it was in the best interests of GE and its shareholders to settle, adding the conglomerate has taken a number of steps to enhance its disclosures and internal controls since the time period covered by the investigation.  Most of GE\u2019s insurance operations were spun off in Genworth Financial Inc more than a decade ago, but it retained some of the legacy long-term care policies and also reinsures policies written by other insurers.  \u201cIt is never a proud moment for a company to have to settle an SEC accounting investigation and pay a civil fine, but we do consider this settlement to be a favorable outcome for GE,\u201d said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.  \u201cIt removes the overhang of the investigation,\u201d said Dray, adding that the SEC\u2019s fine was within the ballpark of the $100 million reserve GE set aside. \u201cWe believe investors recognize that these legacy accounting issues literally date back two CEOs ago.\u201d  The SEC was also investigating revenue recognition accounting at the company\u2019s power business, which led to a $22 billion goodwill write-off in 2018.  In 2017 and 2018, the company\u2019s stock price fell almost 75% as challenges in its power and insurance businesses were disclosed to the public, the SEC said.  The company misled investors by failing to explain that one-quarter of its GE Power profits in 2016 and nearly half in the first three quarters of 2017 stemmed from reductions in its prior cost estimates, the SEC said.  The order also finds that GE failed to tell investors that its reported increase in current industrial cash collections was coming at the expense of cash in future years, the SEC said.  \u201cPublic companies must provide an accurate picture of their business. It\u2019s really very simple,\u201d SEC enforcement chief Stephanie Avakian told reporters during a press briefing on Wednesday.  \u201cYou must speak accurately, about the manner in which you are meeting financial targets and about trends and uncertainties, you are aware of in your business.\u201d  GE, however, said it has neither admitted nor denied any allegations as part of the settlement. The SEC order also makes no allegation that prior period financial statements were misstated, the company said.","402":"(Removes reference in 1st para to Auckland-New York route, adds previous goal for route in 6th para)  * Jets worth $2.7 billion at list prices  * Airbus had proposed A350 as rival option  * Airline selects GE Aviation\u2019s GEnx-1B engines for planes  May 27 (Reuters) - Air New Zealand Ltd said on Monday it had ordered eight Boeing Co 787 jets worth $2.7 billion at list prices, which will by powered by General Electric engines.  The announcement confirmed a Reuters report last week that Boeing had beaten rival Airbus SE, which had proposed the A350 for the hotly contested deal.  The airline, which has Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC engines that have proven problematic on its existing fleet of 13 787s, announced it had switched to GE engines for the new order.  The 787s will replace eight older 777-200ERs and leave the carrier with an all-Boeing wide-body fleet as well as Airbus A320 family jets for shorter flights.  The order comprises eight long-range 787-10s, with the agreement including an option to increase the number of aircraft to 20.  The deal also gives the airline, which has previously mentioned a goal of flying Auckland-New York non-stop, the option to switch some aircraft to the longer range 787-9s.  \u201cWith the 787-10 offering almost 15 percent more space for customers and cargo than the 787-9, this investment creates the platform for our future strategic direction and opens up new opportunities to grow,\u201d Air New Zealand Chief Executive Christopher Luxon said in a statement.  The eight jets will enter the Air New Zealand fleet between 2022 and 2027, the airline said.  \u201cThe 787-10 has 95 percent commonality with Air New Zealand\u2019s existing fleet of 787-9s and will provide the airline with added benefits in terms of capacity and overall operations,\u201d Vice President of Boeing Commercial Sales and Marketing for Asia Pacific Christy Reese said.

The airline said the 787 was 25 percent more fuel efficient than the jets it is replacing, and carriers typically receive large discounts on the list price of jets.

The deal, first reported by Reuters on Sunday, is the biggest to be inked thus far by GE Chief Executive John Flannery since he announced a major overhaul of the U.S. industrial conglomerate late last year.  The transaction values the GE transportation business, which makes train engines, at $11.1 billion. GE will receive a $2.9 billion up-front payment in cash and a 9.9-percent stake in the combined company, with GE shareholders awarded 40.2 percent and existing Wabtec shareholders owning 49.9 percent.  GE shares rose 2.8 percent to $15.39. Wabtec shares rose 4.3 percent to $99.28.  The deal is tax-free for GE and Wabtec shareholders because it is structured as a so-called Reverse Morris Trust, with GE spinning off the transportation unit and simultaneously merging it with Wabtec.  The $11.1 billion deal value includes a $1.1 billion net tax benefit accruing to the combined company, GE and Wabtec said.  The equity value of the company combining Wabtec and GE\u2019s transportation business will be more than $20 billion.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of General Electric is seen at its plant in Baden, Switzerland November 15, 2017. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann\/File Photo  The deal caps a review of the transportation division by GE dating back to last year after a string of setbacks for the 126-year-old company. But it also follows years of on-and-off talks between Wabtec and the GE unit about combining, Wabtec Chief Executive Raymond Betler told Reuters in an interview.  \u201cWe\u2019ve always been quite interested. There has been a relationship between (us) that goes back decades,\u201d he said.  \u201cFor a whole host of reasons, the stars kind of lined up this time, and it presented an opportunity for us to actually get it done.\u201d  Betler will remain president and CEO of the merged company while its chairman, Albert Neupaver, has been re-appointed executive chairman. GE Transportation Chief Executive Rafael Santana will become president and CEO of Wabtec\u2019s freight segment.  The resulting company will have approximately $8 billion in revenues, with 27,000 employees across 50 countries, the companies said. The transaction is expected to close in early 2019.  GE's transportation business, which generated revenue of $3.9 billion last year, is already larger than its sole close peer in the railroad engines business, Caterpillar Inc CAT.N, selling equipment and services to a global fleet of roughly 23,000 locomotives, Santana said.  The deal will add more offerings that can improve efficiency and safety to GE's customers, which include Komatsu Ltd 6301.T and Rio Tinto PLC RIO.L, as well as Wabtec's client base which includes Siemens AG SIEGn.DE and Bombardier Inc BBDb.TO, Santana added.  Wabtec, which has a market capitalization of $9.2 billion, manufactures equipment for locomotives, freight cars, and passenger transit vehicles.  Flannery told GE shareholders late last year he plans to pare GE down to three core businesses: power, aviation and healthcare, a departure from the deal-driven empire building of his predecessors, Jeff Immelt and Jack Welch.  That should include GE getting rid of at least $20 billion of assets through sales, spin-offs or other means.

REUTERS\/Alwyn Scott\/File Photo  Judge Jesse Furman, however, granted the shareholders permission to amend their complaint. The class-action lawsuit, originally filed in November 2017, consolidates six cases that sought to hold GE and its senior leaders accountable for falling profits in recent years.  The suit, brought by more than a dozen U.S. and foreign pension plans, retirement funds and investors in GE, names the company and former Chief Executive Officers Jeff Immelt, John Flannery and other senior executives. It alleges they understated GE\u2019s exposure to long-term care insurance risks and risks related to its long-term service agreements with customers that bought power plant equipment from GE.  \u201cPlaintiffs may be able to allege additional facts regarding the individual defendants\u2019 knowledge, or conscious disregard of, GE\u2019s actuarial issues (with respect to its LTC portfolio) and the trends and risks it should have disclosed (with respect to its LTSAs) that would permit plaintiffs to clear the scienter bar,\u201d Furman wrote in his ruling, referring to the legal term for knowledge of wrongdoing.  In an emailed statement, a GE spokesman said, \u201cWe are pleased the court dismissed the vast majority of the claims against GE, including the securities fraud allegations related to the company\u2019s legacy insurance business. We intend to vigorously defend the rest of the case and continue to believe the claims are without merit.\u201d  The ruling comes just after Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos said GE\u2019s insurance business was under-funded relative to what it owed for long-term care policies.  A subsequent Fitch Ratings report ranked GE\u2019s insurance units as among the most exposed to long-term care and least prepared to pay such claims.  The suit alleges that starting in early 2013, Immelt and other top GE executives repeatedly misled investors by saying GE had sold its insurance business even though GE remained liable for money-losing long-term care policies.  The insurance policies, which cover the cost of assisted-living or nursing care for the elderly, have turned out to require much greater payouts from insurers than was expected when the policies were written in the 1990s and early 2000s.  In January 2018, GE took a surprise $6.2 billion after-tax charge and began setting aside $15 billion to cover future claims from about 300,000 long-term care policies.  GE has denied using fraudulent accounting to hide falling sales and profits at its power unit. It said investors were victims of \u201cbusiness setbacks and forecasting misses\u201d that GE disclosed at the time. GE also said the suit failed to point out specific information it should have provided \u201cthat a reasonable investor would need to avoid being misled.\u201d","421":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (This May 30 story corrects to say GE is cutting power unit headquarters costs 20% and GE plans to cut another $800 mln in power divison costs, not $1.6 bln in the 6th and last paragraph respectively.)  NEW YORK (Reuters) - General Electric Co\u2019s chief executive said on Thursday he was \u201creally stunned\u201d to learn that a major factory had only recently started using lean manufacturing techniques.  \u201cIt put me back a little bit to go to our Greenville, South Carolina, plant last summer and to have the team regale me with a really good lean production (project) that had just been implemented,\u201d Larry Culp said at an investor conference in New York.  \u201cThey did a very nice job. But just -- it really stunned me (to) be there in the summer of 2018 and have such an important plant at GE beginning its lean journey or re-beginning its lean journey.\u201d  Lean techniques are widely used to reduce manufacturing costs while increasing efficiency and quality. GE\u2019s Greenville factory makes large, gas-fired turbines that generate electricity in power plants around the world. GE\u2019s power business has been losing money and is the top priority in Culp\u2019s efforts to turn around the company.  \u201cNo business consumes more of my time right now,\u201d Culp said.  Culp also affirmed on Thursday that GE expects negative free cash flow in the second quarter, and said GE\u2019s power division plans to cut headquarters costs of $1.6 billion by about 20% over the next two years as it tries to become leaner.  Culp said GE cut about $800 million in costs at the power unit last year, and has plans to cut another $800 million through 2020, including the headquarter cost cuts.","422":"(Reuters) - General Electric Co\u2019s Baker Hughes posted quarterly profit that beat Wall Street estimates on Friday as improving oil prices prompted companies to ramp up oil and gas production.  A Baker Hughes sign is displayed outside the oil logistics company's local office in Sherwood Park, near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada November 13, 2016. REUTERS\/Chris Helgren  U.S. crude futures climbed 7.5 percent in the first quarter of 2018, re-energizing oil and gas producers that held back investments in recent years amid a steep drop in prices. That boost has benefited service companies, among the hardest hit by the oil price downturn that started in mid-2014.  \u201cMarket fundamentals remain supportive, as crude oil prices are relatively rangebound, providing stability to customers as they evaluate projects,\u201d said Baker Hughes Chief Executive Officer Lorenzo Simonelli in a statement.  Excluding items, GE Baker Hughes earned 9 cents per share, beating analysts\u2019 estimates by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S. Revenue rose to $5.40 billion from $5.32 billion on a combined basis a year earlier.  Results were boosted by a $124 million benefit from U.S. tax reform in December 2017.  Less than a year ago conglomerate General Electric Co combined its oilfield business with Baker Hughes, creating the second largest oilfield services company by revenue.  The combined company achieved $144 million in synergies in the first quarter of 2018, putting it on track to hit an expected $700 million by year-end, Simonelli said.  Shares were up 0.8 percent at $33.99.  Although the liquefied natural gas (LNG) and offshore markets were stagnant at the start of the year, the company was positive on both segments, Simonelli said.  So were investors. \u201cWe believe offshore and international markets have turned the corner and will soon become a more evident tailwind for the shares,\u201d wrote James West, senior managing director for investment bank Evercore ISI in a note on Friday.  Oilfield services revenue, which accounted for half of overall sales, rose 10.1 percent to $2.64 billion in the quarter. The company was awarded a five-year contract by Kinder Morgan to provide artificial lift services in the Permian Basin as well as a wireline contract with a large international oil company in the Gulf of Mexico, it said.  The company said on Friday it was awarded a subsea equipment contract for Phase II of Chevron\u2019s project in Australia.  Net income attributable to the company was $70 million, or 17 cents per share, in the quarter. Orders rose 8.7 percent.","423":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Three-dimensional printers are letting doctors in Minnesota make simulated body parts in a hospital and a Brooklyn startup create rocket engines designed to put satellites into orbit, executives said Thursday at an event hosted by General Electric Co.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The unusual locations for additive printing, highlighted at the first such event GE has organized, showed how quickly the technology is moving beyond plastic prototypes to everyday industrial use.  Companies are now routinely printing titanium engine parts, customizing dashboards of high-end cars, turning out jewelry and eyeglass frames and developing rocket engines.  General Motors Co said on Thursday it is working with design software company Autodesk Inc to make lightweight 3D-printed parts that could help GM add alternative-fuel vehicles to its product lineup.  GE, which makes metal 3D printers as well as parts, and has invested more than $3 billion in the business, is promoting the technology to show its possibilities and spur broader use.  \u201cPeople are in the very, very beginning stage of understanding the potential,\u201d GE Chief Executive Officer John Flannery said at the event in New York.  At the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, for example, doctors work directly with engineers to print medical devices tailored to patients, said radiologist Jonathan Morris.  \u201cWe\u2019ve put manufacturing inside the hospital,\u201d Morris said. The hospital does not make implants but can simulate body parts to help surgeons decide how to do an operation, or can make guides for cutting and drilling during surgery, he said.  Last year, the clinic printed 1,200 devices for about 700 patients, more than twice as many as the year before.  Launcher, a five-person startup formed last year in Brooklyn, used 3D printers to make a small rocket engine. It could not compete with big aerospace firms if it had to build engines from individual parts. \u201cIt is a matter of existence for us,\u201d Chief Executive Max Haot said of printing technology.  GE expects to sell about 500 printers this year, generating about $500 million in revenue, more than double last year\u2019s sales, said Jason Oliver, chief executive of GE Additive. About 15 percent of the sales are to GE, he said.  The division is part of GE Aviation, where it has been used to improve aircraft engines and reduce their cost. The business will become its own division after investment slows and revenue increases further. \u201cThat\u2019s a couple of years away,\u201d Oliver said.","424":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A year ago, Jeff Immelt told investors at an industry conference there was a \"mismatch\" between the performance of company he led, General Electric Co GE.N, and its stock price.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of General Electric is seen at its plant in Baden, Switzerland November 15, 2017. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann\/File Photo  Immelt, whose departure as chief executive was announced last June, proved prescient but perhaps not in the way he was thinking: GE shares have declined 45 percent since that conference and hit a nearly nine-year low in March.  On Wednesday, Immelt\u2019s successor as chief executive of the industrial conglomerate, John Flannery, will make the case for GE\u2019s investment potential at the same annual Electrical Products Group investor conference in Longboat Key, Florida.  Flannery will have some momentum. The stock price has climbed 20 percent since early April, and GE on Monday clinched a deal to spin off its transportation unit.  But, at around $15.50 a share, the stock is still well in the red for 2018, down 11 percent.  GE shares are trading at lower valuations than those of other diverse manufacturers, with GE at 15.4 times forward earnings estimates, compared with 17.3 times for United Technologies Corp UTX.N and 18 times for Honeywell International Inc HON.N, according Thomson Reuters Datastream.  \u201cIf the company were healthy, the valuation would be very attractive,\u201d said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois. \u201cBut to my eye, there needs to be some more evidence to emerge before I would step in.\u201d  GE\u2019s recent share bounce appear to stem from a few factors, according to Jairam Nathan, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets America.  The recent surge in oil prices stands to benefit GE's oil and gas equipment and services business, which includes exposure through its Baker Hughes BHGE.O oilfield services company.  GE also maintained its 2018 profit guidance in its first quarter report on April 20, encouraging investors who also may have been comforted by progress in Flannery\u2019s plan to divest $20 billion in assets as part of an overhaul, Nathan said.  It announced a $11.1 billion deal on Monday to merge its transportation business with U.S. rail equipment manufacturer Wabtec Corp WAB.N, with GE and its shareholders owning just over half of the combined business.  The deal involving the transportation unit, while a small portion of GE overall, \u201cis what we think investors want,\u201d said Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker. \u201cNamely, they want a simpler, more manageable conglomerate with healthier liquidity.\u201d  After rising 1.9 percent on Monday, GE shares were up another 1 percent on Tuesday.  But a number of issues continued to cloud the outlook for the stock, including the health of GE\u2019s massive power-generation unit, whose profit tumbled last year, and uncertainty about any lingering liabilities at the company including with its GE Capital finance arm.  GE took a $6.2 billion fourth-quarter charge for reevaluation of insurance assets, and sources said on Tuesday that the company is working with investment bankers to find ways to shed its insurance business.  DEBATE OVER DIVIDEND  Investors are also focused on whether GE can generate enough cash flow to cover obligations, including its dividend, which the company cut in half in November.  GE'S dividend yield of 3.15 percent ranks it ninth among the 30 Dow industrial components .DJI.  \u201cThe current dividend payout ratio remains too high for the company to de-leverage over time simply from running its business,\u201d JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa said in a research note on Tuesday. Tusa, a longtime bear on the stock, rates it \u201cunderweight\u201d with a $11 price target.  However, William Blair analyst Nick Heymann, who rates the stock \u201coutperform,\u201d said he believes the dividend \u201cremains secure\u201d and that the transportation deal \u201ccould be a critical catalyst that shifts investor psychology about GE to a value rather than a contrarian investment.\u201d  \u201cInstead of how low GE\u2019s shares might decline, investors are likely to now focus on how long it might take for GE\u2019s shares to rebound,\u201d Heymann said in a research note on Tuesday.","425":"NEW YORK, April 29 (Reuters) - General Electric Co said on Wednesday it had cut 700 jobs in its power division in the first quarter, and that it was on track to reduce capital expenditure by 25% this year.

Fitch said declines in GE\u2019s power business since the third quarter of 2018 and expectations for lower industrial free cash flow in 2019 magnify execution risks to GE\u2019s asset dispositions and de-leveraging plans.  \u201cThese risks could outweigh positive developments expected through the next one to two years that include solid liquidity and lower leverage resulting from planned asset dispositions, ongoing restructuring,\u201d Fitch said, while affirming its \u201cBBB+\u201d rating for GE and its finance arm, GE Capital.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of U.S. conglomerate General Electric is pictured at the company's site of its energy branch in Belfort, France, February 5, 2019. REUTERS\/Vincent Kessler\/File Photo  Culp\u2019s detailed pep talk, which drew praise from Wall Street analysts on a conference call, swiftly reversed an earlier rout in the stock as he stressed GE was serious about its targets after years of missing profit expectations.  The forecast was low largely because GE will be spending $2.5 billion on restructuring this year, Culp said, adding the investment would pay off after a tough 2019.  \u201cThis is what constitutes a \u2018reset,\u2019\u201d Culp said, using a word many analysts had longed to hear.  \u201cThe market should interpret a high level of conviction (in the forecast) simply because this team, in a public forum, is laying this roadmap out, mindful of the realities of 2019 but I think also optimistic ... about the impact of what we\u2019re doing.\u201d  Culp did not soft-pedal the short-term pain. He said 2019 adjusted profit would be 50 cents to 60 cents a share, below analyst estimates of 70 cents, and GE could lose as much as $2 billion in cash from its industrial businesses, putting a number on a warning he issued last week.  The company expects free cash flow at GE Power to remain negative in 2020 before turning positive in 2021.  Investors are looking closely at GE\u2019s cash and earnings after the company lost nearly $23 billion last year.  The outlook is \u201carguably better than expected,\u201d said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.  The company did not make reference to any potential hit to its jet engine unit from the recent global grounding of Boeing Co\u2019s 737 MAX aircraft. GE and partner Safran SA make the engine that powers all 737 MAX planes.  GE shares were up 2.9 percent at $10.31 in afternoon trading, after falling 4 percent in premarket activity shortly after the forecast was released. GE bonds also rose slightly.  \u201cWhile lowered guidance is not a positive, we think GE\u2019s plan and progress show it\u2019s moving in the right direction,\u201d said Jim Corridore, analyst at CFRA.  Culp also left considerable wiggle room in the forecast by including an unspecified amount of \u201ccontingency\u201d money to cover hard-to-predict costs, such as when it will conclude big asset sales and how its power unit will perform.  JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa voiced concern that the gap between GE\u2019s cash flow and earnings forecasts was the widest he had seen, which likely will mean analysts\u2019 profit estimates are too high.  Culp said that although GE was taking \u201ca safe conservative posture in this reset year ...

General Electric's GE.N GE Aviation unit has completed initial designs for the new Affinity turbofan engine, which will be used in Aerion's AS2 jet, the companies said on the eve of the world's largest business jet show.  \u201cWe\u2019re on track to fly in 2023, and before that year is out cross the Atlantic at supersonic speed, which will be the first supersonic crossing since the Concorde\u2019s retirement 20 years earlier,\u201d Aerion chief executive Tom Vice said ahead of the Oct. 16-18 NBAA event in Orlando, Florida.  A push by U.S. start-ups Aerion, Boom Supersonic and Spike Aerospace to re-introduce supersonic passenger travel, for the first time since Anglo-French Concorde retired in 2003, has triggered a debate over noise even at the subsonic level.  Until now, supersonic designs have struggled to meet current subsonic noise standards due to engine constraints.

Asked by an analyst if the 2019 dividend was assured, Flannery said that while payout is important to investors, it depended on multiple factors.  \u201cIt\u2019s ultimately a function of the free cash flow of the company and that\u2019s ultimately a function of operating performance and things that we do with the portfolio,\u201d Flannery told analysts at the annual Electrical Products Group conference in Florida.

Cash flow from assets sold is obviously gone making dividend unsustainable.\u201d  GE shares tumbled 7.7 percent to $14.11 in afternoon trading, putting them on track for the biggest daily percentage decline since Flannery became CEO last August. The stock\u2019s previous record drop under Flannery was 7.2 percent on Nov. 13, when he gave his first major update as CEO.  Former CEO Jeff Immelt, speaking a year ago at the same conference Flannery addressed on Wednesday, said there was a \u201cmismatch\u201d between GE\u2019s value and the performance of the company, and that the stock should climb.  Instead, GE\u2019s shares have fallen 47 percent in the past year as profit deteriorated at its power business and GE revealed unexpected liabilities in its GE Capital unit.  Since early April the stock climbed 20 percent as analysts reassessed the company\u2019s prospects now that it has installed a new board and begun making the promised asset sales.  But that view appeared to be undercut by Flannery\u2019s remarks on Wednesday. He said he expects no profit growth at its large power business this year, and is planning for the power market to remain weak through 2020. Profit at the unit tumbled 53 percent last year to $1.9 billion.  He affirmed GE's targets for 2018 profit and free cash flow, and said profit at GE's Baker Hughes BHGE.N oil and gas unit would rise by 50 percent or more this year, while profit at the aviation business would be up 15 percent.

Ganesh Bell, former chief digital officer at GE and chief executive officer at GE Power Digital, will become president of Chicago-based Uptake later this month, these people said. An announcement was expected Wednesday.  Uptake, co-founded in 2014 by Groupon Inc GRPN.O co-founders Brad Keywell and Eric Lefkofsky, is among a number of companies creating software to make power plants, jet engines, wind farms and other industrial machinery run more efficiently and reliably.  Uptake has raised more than $250 million in venture funding from Revolution, GreatPoint Ventures and Baillie Gifford. Its latest series D round of funding in November gave the company a $2.3 billion valuation.  Uptake's customers include Berkshire Hathaway Energy BRKa.N, which deployed its software on U.S. wind turbines.  Bell was among the executives leading industrial-internet software development at GE, concentrating on GE\u2019s power unit. GE has sold its Predix software platform and applications to utilities and other industries. GE said last year it would narrow its focus to aviation, healthcare and power.  Uptake\u2019s software analyzes data in agriculture, construction, mining, aviation, railways, vehicle fleets, energy and wind power, and oil, gas and petrochemicals, according to the company.  Before GE, Bell held executive roles at enterprise software companies including ServiceSource International Inc SREV.O, SAP SE SAPG.DE and PeopleSoft, which was acquired by Oracle Corp.

Ernst said GE had disclosed the risk of $1 billion in additional British tax with third-quarter earnings, but considers it unlikely. \u201cWe expect to successfully contest the assessment, if made, and not owe any additional taxes to the U.K.,\u201d Ernst said.  The payments would come after GE reported a $22.8 billion quarterly loss last week, and has seen its cash income plummet as it has taken more than $40 billion in writedowns and charges in less than a year from its power division, long-term care insurance portfolio, the tax law and other issues.  Ernst\u2019s comments came after analyst John Inch at research firm Gordon Haskett, said years of booking \u201cinexplicably low tax rates\u201d could land GE with billions of dollars of additional cash tax payments in the United States.  GE likely owed up to $9 billion in taxes under the 2017 corporate tax cuts, but took only a $3.3 billion charge while saying \u201coffsets\u201d would reduce cash tax costs in the future.  \u201cThe taxman knocks,\u201d said Inch in the note, published on Friday. \u201cIf even some of these \u2018offsets\u2019 are disallowed the company could wind up owing a large tax bill near term.\u201d  Inch also said GE\u2019s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liabilities could exceed $100 billion. Paying would be difficult as GE is trying to turn around troubled businesses.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of U.S. conglomerate General Electric is pictured at the company's site of its energy branch in Belfort, France, February 5, 2019. REUTERS\/Vincent Kessler  \u201cIndustrial free cash flow will be (in) negative territory,\u201d compared with a positive $4.5 billion last year, CEO Larry Culp said in a webcast interview with JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa, a longtime GE bear.  The shock remark dealt a fresh blow to GE investors who have watched the Boston-based conglomerate slash its dividend as it took massive asset write-downs and huge insurance charges last year. The stock is up nearly 36 percent this year but is still worth less than a third of its value in mid-2016.  \u201cI don\u2019t want to sugarcoat\u201d the problems in GE\u2019s power business, Culp said, adding the unit likely will lose more cash in 2019 than the $2.7 billion in free cash flow it lost in 2018.  The cash forecast shows \u201cdemand for GE\u2019s (power) turbines is half what the company forecast two years ago, and this is likely to persist into 2020,\u201d said Jim Corridore, an analyst at CFRA, who rates GE a \u201cbuy.\u201d  The stock swiftly fell below $10, the company\u2019s biggest intraday percentage drop in more than three months, which knocked more than $4 billion off GE\u2019s market value. The shares closed 4.7 percent lower at $9.89 on Tuesday after falling as much as 7.6 percent.  GE\u2019s bonds also declined, with GE Capital bonds the hardest hit. A $2.25 billion issue at 4.5 percent coming due in March 2044 was down 1.65 percent.  \u201cThe risk of additional debt ratings downgrades has now increased,\u201d said John Inch, an analyst at Gordon Haskett Research Advisors, who rates GE \u201cunderperform.\u201d  GE\u2019s bonds are rated three notches above junk and it is selling assets to reduce its high level of debt.  Culp\u2019s comments went well beyond his January warning that industrial free cash flow, which excludes GE Capital dividends and cash from asset sales, would weaken in 2019. Investors are looking closely at GE\u2019s cash because of the gap between cash and earnings.  Profits collapsed at GE\u2019s power unit in mid-2017 as sales fell and the company failed to deliver on promises to increase margins after a $10 billion acquisition of Alstom of France.  Since then, GE has blamed the power unit\u2019s losses, which totaled $22 billion last year, on its own poor management and a shift toward new wind and solar power plants.  The power unit is spending at least $480 million to fix thousands of turbine blades that are at risk after blades broke in 2015 and 2018, causing serious damage to power turbines and coinciding with a drop in GE\u2019s market share.  GE also has poured billions of dollars into its insurance business, which includes thousands of money-losing long-term care policies written more than a decade ago. Some experts said GE may have to spend billions more to cover claims.  Culp said the power business would face headwinds for \u201ca couple of years,\u201d would not resolve problems with breaking power turbine blades for \u201ca while\u201d and promised to step up restructuring in the business and elsewhere. GE declined to provide restructuring cost estimates. The company is due to publish a financial forecast on March 14.  Culp said on Tuesday that GE would continue to provide cash to its GE Capital unit for the foreseeable future, though probably not as much as the $4 billion it provided last year.  GE Capital used to pay dividends to the parent company, but that stopped after losses mounted at GE\u2019s reinsurance business in the second half of 2017.","443":"NEW YORK, June 26 (Reuters) - The machinists union said on Wednesday it opposes a tentative labor contract reached this week with General Electric Co, potentially impeding the Boston-based conglomerate\u2019s efforts to avoid labor unrest during a difficult period.  \u201cOur recommendation is to reject,\u201d Brian Bryant, general vice president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) told Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s what we consider a concessionary contract.\u201d (Reporting by Alwyn Scott Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)","444":"(Reuters) - The collapse of global air travel has stopped General Electric Co's GE.N turnaround plan in its tracks and the company will have to convince investors on Wednesday that it is on course to reduce cash burn through the rest of 2020.

Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp said in May the company would do better in the second half of 2020 while admitting that for the full year it would be in negative territory on cashflow.

Added to that, several large U.S. power plants with banks of GE generators are halting or deferring maintenance due to quarantines and lockdowns, threatening to squeeze revenue that the company was counting on to help lift profits.  Together, aviation and power normally make up the bulk of GE\u2019s quarterly revenue.  \u201cLarry said a year ago he is managing the company for free cash flow,\u201d said RBC Capital Markets Deane Dray, who forecasts free cash flow at a negative $3.8 billion for the quarter.  \u201c(For the market) it all depends on how well GE performs within their own FCF guidance and what is the explanation of the variances.\u201d  Healthcare is the only bright spot currently, with demand for ventilators, X-ray machines and other equipment expected to boost profit.

We made wonderful deals together. He will never be forgotten. My warmest sympathies to his wonderful wife & family!\u201d  LAWRENCE CULP, CEO of GE  \u201cJack was larger than life and the heart of GE for half a century. He reshaped the face of our company and the business world. Jack was a strong and constant influence throughout my career despite never having worked directly for him.\u201d  \u201cWhen I last saw him, what I remember most vividly was when he asked me, \u2018So how exactly are you running the company?\u2019 Jack was still in it \u2013 committed to GE\u2019s success. And to have Jack Welch ask me how I am running GE is pretty humbling.\u201d  JAMIE DIMON, CEO of JPMorgan Chase  \u201cJack was an exceptional man and an outstanding leader who had such enormous impact on the role of business in our country.\u201d  \u201cWith indefatigable spirit and sound judgment, he led GE through good times and difficult times. And all the while, he stood tall and always did the right thing for his company and his country.\u201d  \u201cPersonally, I always admired him as a mentor, as a friend, and even as a fatherly figure. He really set the standard as a CEO, not just in his performance running the company and as a legendary leader, but in his deep integrity, big heart and strategic vision.\u201d  STEVE MILLER, chairman of Purdue Pharma and former CEO of Delphi Corp  \u201cHe had the skill of identifying talent, and nurturing talent, and developing it, and those people have become business leaders elsewhere. The best single day example was the day Jeff Immelt was announced to succeed Jack Welch. The other three internal contenders were very strong, and instantly got other jobs.\u201d  \u201cThere are some leaders who destroy anyone who challenges their authority, (who say) you have to keep me on the job, there is no one else here who can do it. Jack was just the opposite, he developed incredibly strong talent around him. That\u2019s why GE for a long time was the best company around. For a very long time it was very hard to pry anyone away from GE.\u201d  TIM HUBBARD, assistant professor of management at the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Mendoza College of Business  \u201cHis aggressive, in-your-face style and edict to be number one or two in every major sector was embraced by both management consultants and business school faculty. Jack\u2019s aggressive style was matched by his growth-by-acquisition strategy which allowed GE to produce consistent double-digit growth in earnings per share. And, while his performance was tremendous, his exit was followed by arguably poor performance of future GE CEOs.

The U.S. Department of Commerce, which issues such licenses, declined to comment, saying it cannot discuss individual license applications. The White House also declined to comment.  But in February, President Donald Trump intervened, blasting U.S. proposals that would prevent companies from supplying jet engines and other components to China\u2019s budding aviation industry.  \u201cI want China to buy our jet engines, the best in the World,\u201d Trump tweeted on Feb. 18. \u201cI want to make it EASY to do business with the United States, not difficult.

It\u2019s got to be real national security. And I think people were getting carried away with it,\u201d he told reporters.  GE had received licenses for the LEAP engines since 2014 and was last granted one in March 2019, as the C919 plane was developed and began to engage in test flights.  Such licenses are typically valid for four years with a defined quantity and value, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The engine is a joint venture between GE and France's Safran Aircraft Engines SAF.PA.  \u201cWe received notification that GE Aviation has license approval for engines for the C919,\u201d a GE spokeswoman told Reuters on Tuesday.  Safran confirmed GE received the license approval.  COMAC was not immediately available for comment.  The license approval comes as U.S. officials have agreed to press forward with new measures to control high-tech exports to China, and to require foreign companies that use U.S. chipmaking equipment to obtain a license before supplying certain chips to China\u2019s Huawei Technologies.  COMAC is an acronym for Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd.
