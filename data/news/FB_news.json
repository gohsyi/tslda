Reuters Fact Check. REUTERS  One viral post with over 11,000 shares and flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to tackle misinformation can be seen here .  Face-coverings act in a way that primarily protects others from the individual wearing a mask. Following initial confusion over how masks work and whether they work in protecting the population at large, the Atlantic reported in April on the benefits of wearing masks, which not only protect the individual but more importantly the people they come into contact with (here).  Research has shown that effective prevention methods such as mask wearing, and hand washing combined with social distancing \u201ccan be pivotal to achieving control over a COVID-19 epidemic.\u201d While direct contact precautions - social distancing, quarantine and isolation, and hand sanitizing - help minimize virus transmission by direct contact, face covering helps prevent airborne transmission, researchers say. (here)  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has shared guidance on wearing masks visible here and here .  The image\u2019s implication of bacteria and dirt being trapped on the woman\u2019s face makes an uncompelling argument as anything trapped inside would be from any ailment she may already have. Proper mask hygiene and cleaning should be done regularly (after each wear) to clean away any germs that may be on the mask.

The company offers its 2.3 billion users features such as menus and prompts in 111 different languages, deemed to be officially supported. Reuters has found another 31 widely spoken languages on Facebook that do not have official support.  Detailed rules known as \u201ccommunity standards,\u201d which bar users from posting offensive material including hate speech and celebrations of violence, were translated in only 41 languages out of the 111 supported as of early March, Reuters found.  Facebook\u2019s 15,000-strong content moderation workforce speaks about 50 tongues, though the company said it hires professional translators when needed. Automated tools for identifying hate speech work in about 30.  The language deficit complicates Facebook\u2019s battle to rein in harmful content and the damage it can cause, including to the company itself. Countries including Australia, Singapore and the UK are now threatening harsh new regulations, punishable by steep fines or jail time for executives, if it fails to promptly remove objectionable posts.  The community standards are updated monthly and run to about 9,400 words in English.  Monika Bickert, the Facebook vice president in charge of the standards, has previously told Reuters that they were \u201ca heavy lift to translate into all those different languages.\u201d  A Facebook spokeswoman said this week the rules are translated case by case depending on whether a language has a critical mass of usage and whether Facebook is a primary information source for speakers. The spokeswoman said there was no specific number for critical mass.  She said among priorities for translations are Khmer, the official language in Cambodia, and Sinhala, the dominant language in Sri Lanka, where the government blocked Facebook this week to stem rumors about devastating Easter Sunday bombings.  A Reuters report found last year that hate speech on Facebook that helped foster ethnic cleansing in Myanmar went unchecked in part because the company was slow to add moderation tools and staff for the local language.  Facebook says it now offers the rules in Burmese and has more than 100 speakers of the language among its workforce.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  The spokeswoman said Facebook\u2019s efforts to protect people from harmful content had \u201ca level of language investment that surpasses most any technology company.\u201d  But human rights officials say Facebook is in jeopardy of a repeat of the Myanmar problems in other strife-torn nations where its language capabilities have not kept up with the impact of social media.  \u201cThese are supposed to be the rules of the road and both customers and regulators should insist social media platforms make the rules known and effectively police them,\u201d said Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch\u2019s Asia Division. \u201cFailure to do so opens the door to serious abuses.\u201d  ABUSE IN FIJIAN  Mohammed Saneem, the supervisor of elections in Fiji, said he felt the impact of the language gap during elections in the South Pacific nation in November last year. Racist comments proliferated on Facebook in Fijian, which the social network does not support. Saneem said he dedicated a staffer to emailing posts and translations to a Facebook employee in Singapore to seek removals.  Facebook said it did not request translations, and it gave Reuters a post-election letter from Saneem praising its \u201ctimely and effective assistance.\u201d  Saneem told Reuters that he valued the help but had expected pro-active measures from Facebook.  \u201cIf they are allowing users to post in their language, there should be guidelines available in the same language,\u201d he said.  Similar issues abound in African nations such as Ethiopia, where deadly ethnic clashes among a population of 107 million have been accompanied by ugly Facebook content. Much of it is in Amharic, a language supported by Facebook. But Amharic users looking up rules get them in English.  At least 652 million people worldwide speak languages supported by Facebook but where rules are not translated, according to data from language encyclopedia Ethnologue. Another 230 million or more speak one of the 31 languages that do not have official support.  Facebook uses automated software as a key defense against prohibited content. Developed using a type of artificial intelligence known as machine learning, these tools identify hate speech in about 30 languages and \u201cterrorist propaganda\u201d in 19, the company said.  Machine learning requires massive volumes of data to train computers, and a scarcity of text in other languages presents a challenge in rapidly growing the tools, Guy Rosen, the Facebook vice president who oversees automated policy enforcement, has told Reuters.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  GROWTH REGIONS  Beyond the automation and a few official fact-checkers, Facebook relies on users to report problematic content. That creates a major issue where community standards are not understood or even known to exist.  Ebele Okobi, Facebook\u2019s director of public policy for Africa, told Reuters in March that the continent had the world\u2019s lowest rates of user reporting.  \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t even know that there are community standards,\u201d Okobi said.  Facebook has bought radio advertisements in Nigeria and worked with local organizations to change that, she said. It also has held talks with African education officials to introduce social media etiquette into the curriculum, she said.  Simultaneously, Facebook is partnering with wireless carriers and other groups to expand internet access in countries including Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo where it has yet to officially support widely-used languages such as Luganda and Kituba. Asked this week about the expansions without language support, Facebook declined to comment.  The company announced in February it would soon have its first 100 sub-Saharan Africa-based content moderators at an outsourcing facility in Nairobi. They will join existing teams in reviewing content in Somali, Oromo and other languages.  But the community standards are not translated into Somali or Oromo. Posts in Somali from last year celebrating the al-Shabaab militant group remained on Facebook for months despite a ban on glorifying organizations or acts that Facebook designates as terrorist.  \u201cDisbelievers and apostates, die with your anger,\u201d read one post seen by Reuters this month that praised the killing of a Sufi cleric.  After Reuters inquired about the post, Facebook said it took down the author\u2019s account because it violated policies.  ABILITY TO DERAIL  Posts in Amharic reviewed by Reuters this month attacked the Oromo and Tigray ethnic populations in vicious terms that clearly violated Facebook\u2019s ban on discussing ethnic groups using \u201cviolent or dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for exclusion.\u201d  Facebook removed the two posts Reuters inquired about. The company added that it had erred in allowing one of them, from December 2017, to remain online following an earlier user report.  For officials such as Saneem in Fiji, Facebook\u2019s efforts to improve content moderation and language support are painfully slow. Saneem said he warned Facebook months in advance of the election in the archipelago of 900,000 people. Most of them use Facebook, with half writing in English and half in Fijian, he estimated.  \u201cSocial media has the ability to completely derail an election,\u201d Saneem said.  Other social media companies face the same problem to varying degrees.  Facebook-owned Instagram said its 1,179-word community guidelines are in 30 out of 51 languages offered to users. WhatsApp, owned by Facebook as well, has terms in nine of 58 supported languages, Reuters found.  Alphabet Inc\u2019s YouTube presents community guidelines in 40 of 80 available languages, Reuters found. Twitter Inc\u2019s rules are in 37 of 47 supported languages, and Snap Inc\u2019s in 13 out of 21.  \u201cA lot of misinformation gets spread around and the problem with the content publishers is the reluctance to deal with it,\u201d Saneem said. \u201cThey do owe a duty of care. \u201c","3":"* Italian bank stocks take big hit on budget concerns  * Wall Street gains led by Nvidia later dented by Facebook  * Brent crude hits 4-yr high with U.S. sanctions on Iran (Adds settled oil prices, Facebook and Tesla moves; recasts with lower Wall Street; updates throughout)  NEW YORK, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose on Friday as the euro fell on deepening worries about the Italian budget and its new higher-than-expected deficit target, which also slammed European stocks.  Wall Street pulled back from early gains by Facebook after the social network disclosed a security breach, and Tesla shares sank 14.2 percent after U.S. regulators sued Chief Executive Elon Musk.  In Italy, Rome on Thursday targeted a budget deficit of 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) for the next three years, marking a victory for party chiefs over economy minister Giovanni Tria, an unaffiliated technocrat.  The deficit, though within the prescribed EU limit of 3 percent of GDP, is a concern for investors who fear the anti-establishment government is not committed to tackling its huge debt load. Italy\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio stands at about 130 percent, the highest in the euro zone behind Greece.  The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.83 percent. Shares in Italian banks fell as much as 8.5 percent and closed 7.26 percent lower.  Italian government bonds were set for their worst day since a brutal May 29 sell-off, up 34-42 basis points across the curve.  The euro fell 0.25 percent to $1.161. MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.27 percent.  Wall Street started out in a rosier mood, with the tech sector getting a boost from higher Nvidia Corp shares after Evercore raised the chipmaker\u2019s price target to $400.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 12.71 points, or 0.05 percent, to 26,427.22, the S&P 500 lost 1.49 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,912.51 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.42 points, or 0.02 percent, to 8,040.55.  In Asia earlier, Japan\u2019s Nikkei stock index raced to a 27-year high on renewed optimism over the global economy and hopes of a boost to its exporters\u2019 earnings from a weaker yen. The index closed 1.36 percent higher.  KING DOLLAR REIGNS  The dollar index rose 0.25 percent.  \u201cThe U.S. dollar remains a metaphorical rock in a sea of troubles,\u201d said Karl Schamotta, director of global product and market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto.  \u201cThe growth outlook for other Group of 10 countries and the emerging markets remains uncertain, and increased confidence in the forces compelling the Federal Reserve to hike rates next year is helping to lift the U.S. dollar against its counterparts,\u201d he added.  After the Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday - the third increase this year - Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the United States does not face a large chance of a recession in the next two years and the central bank plans to keep raising rates gradually.  Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 2\/32 in price to yield 3.0482 percent, from 3.055 percent late on Thursday.  \u201cWe are seeing safety trade due to the Italian crisis, people are coming in and buying U.S. paper and the dollar,\u201d said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.  Energy stocks also got a boost from oil prices, with Brent crude climbing to a fresh four-year high as U.S. sanctions on Tehran squeezed Iranian crude exports.  U.S. crude oil futures settled at $73.25 per barrel, up $1.13 or 1.57 percent. Brent crude settled at $82.72, $1.00 or 1.22 percent higher.","4":"NEW YORK\/SAN FRANCISCO(Reuters) - Facebook Inc will face unprecedented regulatory scrutiny over a new digital currency that the social media company hopes will become globally recognized legal tender within a year.  FILE PHOTO: Representations of virtual currency are displayed in front of the Libra logo in this illustration picture, June 21, 2019. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  Since Facebook unveiled its cryptocurrency, called Libra, 10 days ago, Reuters has spoken with more than a dozen people with experience in financial regulation, financial technology, payments or cryptocurrency. Few expected government agencies to proceed lightly.  The company\u2019s announcement was met with immediate backlash from U.S. lawmakers and regulators across the globe, who are concerned that Facebook is already too massive and careless with users\u2019 privacy.  Randal Quarles, chair of the Financial Stability Board, which coordinates financial rules for G20 countries, warned this week that wider use of crypto-assets for retail payments needs close global scrutiny by regulators. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin remain one of the least-regulated areas of finance.  \u201cIt\u2019s a complete disaster from a regulatory perspective,\u201d said Barry Lynn, executive director of antitrust advocacy group the Open Markets Institute. \u201cThis is a corporation that\u2019s got fires all over the world with regulators. It\u2019s only going to get worse.\u201d  The plan for Libra involves taking customer deposits, investing them in government bonds, holding traditional currencies in reserves and offering cross-border services and transacting in the new coin will require engagement with central banks, financial regulators and enforcement authorities around the globe.  The Facebook subsidiary formed to handle Libra transactions, called Calibra, has applied for money-transfer licenses in the United States and registered with the U.S. Financial Crimes and Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a money services business, a spokesman said.  It has also applied for the license required to operate a cryptocurrency business in New York from the state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, a person familiar with the matter said. Representatives of Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, the Bank of England, and Switzerland\u2019s financial regulator FINMA have also said Facebook has been in touch.  \u201cThe scrutiny that we\u2019ve seen is something that we expected and welcome,\u201d a Facebook spokesman said. \u201cWe announced this early by design in order to have this discourse in the open and gather feedback.\u201d  Reserves would be subject to monetary policies of countries where funds are located, the spokesman said. Calibra does not plan to apply for local banking licenses, he added.  Facebook also formed a Geneva-based association to govern the new coin and hold the reserves, alongside several major partners.  They plan to launch the whole system in the first half of 2020, and intend to eventually offer a broad suite of financial services, including loans.  \u201cThey will not get a free pass anywhere,\u201d said Sean Park, Founder and Chief Investment Officer, at Anthemis, a venture capital firm that backs digital financial services companies. \u201cAnd, given their intention to be global, they will ultimately need literally hundreds, perhaps thousands, of licenses from hundreds of different regulators across the globe.\u201d  Besides central banks, markets regulators, consumer protection watchdogs, and agencies that tackle money laundering, tax evasion and other financial crimes, Facebook\u2019s payment network might also have to adhere to the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures that are set by the Bank for International Settlements and the International Organization of Securities Commissions.  There are also the privacy and antitrust regulators around the globe with whom Facebook is already battling.  \u201cJust in terms of new regulators, it\u2019s a whole new ball game,\u201d said Jeff Bandman, a former U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission official who now runs the fintech regulatory consultancy Bandman Advisors. \u201cA year is enough time to meet with regulators, figure out where the real trouble spots are and potentially scale it back to something narrower.\u201d  But its a challenge that Facebook appears willing to take, given the potential payoff with its 2.4 billion users, and the prospect of replicating the success of Chinese social networks such as WeChat, which has grown profits by offering financial services on its apps.  RBC analysts described Libra as a \u201cpotential watershed moment\u201d for Facebook in terms of revenue and user engagement.  However, the costs could be substantial before income starts rolling in. It will need to set up an internal compliance framework with staffers who screen transactions for illicit activity and verify customer identities.  Money-transfer giant Western Union Co for instance has spent $1 billion in compliance over the past five years, a spokesman said.  Western Union is registered with FinCen and regulated under the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, with licenses in 49 states, plus Washington, D.C. and three U.S. territories. It has licenses in more than 30 countries, and reporting obligations in more than 54.  \u201cI would say the risks are commensurate with the returns \u2013 potentially huge,\u201d said Pascal Bouvier, managing partner at MiddleGame Ventures, a financial technology venture capital firm.","5":"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The U.S. government has asked Australia to scrap proposed laws that will make it the first country in the world to force Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google to pay for news sourced from local media outlets.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  In a submission asking the government to \u201csuspend\u201d the plans, assistant U.S. trade representatives Daniel Bahar and Karl Ehlers, suggested Australia instead \u201cfurther study the markets, and if appropriate, develop a voluntary code.\u201d  Under the law, which has broad political support and is currently before a senate committee, Google and Facebook will be subject to mandatory price arbitration if a commercial agreement on payments to Australian media cannot be reached.  \u201cThe U.S. Government is concerned that an attempt, through legislation, to regulate the competitive positions of specific players ... to the clear detriment of two U.S. firms, may result in harmful outcomes,\u201d said in the document, under the letterhead of the Executive Office of the President.  Such a move could also \u201craise concerns with respect to Australia\u2019s international trade obligations,\u201d it said.  The Australian government announced the legislation last month after an investigation found the tech giants held too much market power in the media industry, a situation it said posed a potential threat to a well-functioning democracy.  Asked for a response to the U.S. submission, Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in a statement the government \u201cis committed to proceeding with a mandatory code\u201d that would address \u201cthe bargaining power imbalances with digital platforms and media companies.\u201d  The code followed an 18-month review by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Chairman and \u201cextensive consultation\u201d that included the views of both Google and Facebook, he added.  The ACCC inquiry found that for every A$100 of online advertising spend, A$53 goes to Google, A$28 to Facebook and A$19 to other media companies.  Following intense but unsuccessful lobbying of the Australian government from both tech giants to scrap the proposed laws, which they deem unfair, Google and Facebook have suggested they may be forced to limit their offerings in the country.

FILE PHOTO: Small toy figures are seen in front of Facebook logo in this illustration picture, April 8, 2019. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  The company raised its minimum wage to $20 per hour in the San Francisco Bay Area, New York and Washington D.C. and to $18 per hour in Seattle. It said it was clear that $15 an hour would not now meet the needs of the workers it employs through third-party contractors as cooks, cleaners, security guards or drivers.  The world's largest social media company also said here it will pay at least $22 per hour for content reviewers in the Bay Area, New York City and Washington, D.C., $20 per hour to those living in Seattle and $18 per hour in all other metro areas in the United States.  \u201cAfter reviewing a number of factors including third-party guidelines, we\u2019re committing to a higher standard that better reflects local costs of living,\u201d the social media giant said in a blog post.  Facebook last raised minimum wages for contract workers in 2015 to $15 per hour in its bid to narrow the widening gap between the technology sector\u2019s elite and the lower-paid workers.  It said it would be implementing the changes announced on Monday by the middle of next year and was working to develop similar standards for other countries.  Last year, Amazon.com Inc raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour after facing criticism over poor pay and working conditions. The online retailer said at the time that it would lobby Washington for the federal minimum wage to be raised.  Silicon Valley is under pressure to close the income gap given California\u2019s high cost of living. The Office of Labor Standards Enforcement said it raised the minimum wage in San Francisco to $15.59 per hour beginning July 1.  U.S. corporations have also been finding it tougher to attract workers, with unemployment at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, while there has been growing political pressure on companies to pay workers a fair living wage.  Walmart, the world's largest retailer and the largest U.S. private sector employer, pays workers $11 an hour at entry-level, while Target Corp said here in April it would raise U.S. minimum wage to $13 an hour.  \u201cFacebook is competing with other Silicon Valley tech companies for talent and it is supply and demand that sets the price for labor as well as anything else,\u201d said Ivan Feinseth, an analyst with Tigress Financial Partners.  \u201cIt is more about competing in a very tight labor market which is dictating the amount of money companies are willing to pay then the set state minimum wage.\u201d  BETTER CARE  Facebook already requires its contractors to provide comprehensive healthcare to all employees and it outlined further steps it was taking to safeguard the mental health of its legion of content reviewers globally.  The company has conducted a huge expansion in content moderation and oversight since the Cambridge Analytica scandal last year focused attention on its approach to users\u2019 privacy and the use of it as a platform by political extremists.  A number of media reports, however, have focused attention on the conditions under which reviewers, employed by third party contractors including Genpact and Wipro Ltd, work.  Reuters reported in February that contract employees in India, part of a 1,600-member team at Genpact monitoring nudity and pornography on Facebook and Instagram, view 2,000 posts in an eight-hour shift, which amounts to almost four a minute.  The company said it would now require contractors to provide on-site counseling during all hours of operation and not just certain hours of each shift. It would also survey all contract employees twice a year, it said, and react to the results.  \u201cWe\u2019re kicking off a biannual audit and compliance program this year for content review teams,\u201d the company said.  \u201cThis includes formal audits, unannounced onsite checks, and vendor partner self-reporting. We also have a whistleblower hotline where anyone who does contract work \u2014 including content reviewers \u2014 can raise concerns directly to Facebook.\u201d","8":"Dec 10 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc said on Thursday some users were facing issues while sending messages on Messenger, Instagram and its office collaboration service Workplace.  \u201cWe\u2019re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible,\u201d a company spokesperson said.  Outage tracking website Downdetector.com showed that there are more than 1,800 incidents of people reporting issues with Messenger and 350 reports on Instagram.  On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and nearly every U.S. state filed lawsuits against Facebook, saying it used a \u201cbuy or bury\u201d strategy to snap up rivals and keep smaller competitors at bay.  The FTC had said in a statement that it would seek an injunction that \u201ccould, among other things: require divestitures of assets, including Instagram and WhatsApp.\u201d","9":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc on Wednesday warned that privacy changes coming from Apple Inc could hurt smaller developers such as gaming companies disproportionately but will likely leave its own apps mostly unscathed.  FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen placed on a keyboard in this illustration taken March 25, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  In a blog post, Facebook said it was making a change to its own apps - which in addition to its flagship app also include WhatsApp and Instagram - that would likely spare them from having to ask iPhone users for data-tracking permissions that many advertising industry insiders believe users will refuse.  Facebook shares surged 8.2% on Wednesday to close at $303.91, a record high for a second straight day.  In a blog post, Facebook said it was also making changes that could hurt smaller developers that use a Facebook tool for serving apps in third-party apps. The changes come ahead of Apple\u2019s new rules, which require increased user notifications for ad tracking and will take effect when new iPhones arrive this fall.  Facebook said it was considering discontinuing on iPhones a tool called Audience Network, which thousands of developers put into their apps to serve ads. Facebook collects data about users from the apps where it serves those ads, which it uses to inform highly tailored targeting throughout its business.  \"Apple's updates may render Audience Network so ineffective on iOS 14 that it may not make sense to offer it on iOS 14,\" Facebook said in a blog post bit.ly\/3lh5zcp. (bit.ly\/3lh5zcp)  The Audience Network business, while an important source of revenue and traffic to small developers such as gaming companies, is far from Facebook\u2019s biggest business, said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at GroupM. \u201cIt would surprise me if it was greater than $1 billion on a net basis,\u201d he said.  Apple previously provided a tool called the identifier for advertisers, or IDFA, that allowed Facebook and others to engage in such tracking of users across apps.  But in June, the iPhone maker said such activity will require a pop-up notification saying the app \u201cwould like permission to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.\u201d Digital advertising firms expect most users will decline to grant that permission.  \u201cApple is saying, we had an \u2018opt out\u2019 system before, and we\u2019re going to switch to an \u2018opt in\u2019 system,\u201d said Craig Danuloff, chief executive of The Privacy Co, which makes an app to help users assess how private their data is.  \u201cWhat do advertisers say? They immediately assume it\u2019s Armageddon. They just know nobody really wants this.\u201d  As an alternative to the tracking tools it previously provided advertisers, Apple created a new advertising network technology that was better for privacy protection of users.  Facebook on Wednesday said it would stop using Apple\u2019s older tracking tools in its own apps and adopt Apple\u2019s new offering, though it said Apple\u2019s new technology \u201climits the data available to businesses for running and measuring campaigns.\u201d  The changes Facebook announced Wednesday will fall hardest on ads that prompt users to install new mobile apps, a format that is heavily used in the video game industry.  \u201cApple\u2019s iOS 14 changes will certainly negatively affect the way that game studios and publishers currently raise revenue and gain users through sales targeted advertisements,\u201d Renee Gittins, executive director of the International Game Developers Association, said in a statement.  John Nardone, chief executive of ad serving software company Flashtalking, said Apple\u2019s move to restrict its ad business could be viewed as anti-competitive by raising prices for consumers used to free, ad-supported apps.  \u201cThere\u2019s self-interest in Apple doing this because as the advertising revenue stream becomes more difficult, then apps have to charge users and Apple, as you know from the Epic Games case, takes 30% of that,\u201d Nardone said. \u201cApple doesn\u2019t have a stake in ads but they have a stake in paid apps.\u201d  For publishers the burden may be less, said David Chavern, president of the News Media Alliance, which represents several major U.S. publishers.  Many rely on what is known as first-party data, such as which stories a user reads, to determine which ads to show, an activity which is not subject to Apple\u2019s new rules.  \u201cNews publishers aren\u2019t huge beneficiaries of cross-app tracking and, more broadly, we all see the ecosystem moving against highly targeted programmatic ads,\u201d he said. \u201cThere may end up being benefits to publishers from that, such as a some move back to contextual advertising.\u201d","10":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook Inc said on Wednesday it has declined an invitation to testify at a U.S. House of Representatives hearing Thursday on filtering practices by social media companies, a company spokesman said.

FILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is displayed on a smartphone in this illustration taken January 6, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  Here are some answers to key questions about the case:  WHAT ARE THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST FACEBOOK?  One of the allegations against Facebook is that it strategically seeks to buy potential rivals, often at a big premium, before they have a chance to grow. For example, Facebook bought Instagram in 2012, which at the time had no revenue and a handful of employees but an impressive number of users. It then purchased Onavo in 2013, which protected its users from third-party tracking. It has used Onavo to identify other takeover targets. It bought WhatsApp in 2014.  The FTC also alleged in its complaint that Facebook enticed small, new companies onto the platform in order to make Facebook more attractive to users, but only if they refrained from competing with Facebook itself or with Facebook Messenger.  WHAT REMEDIES DID THE FTC REQUEST THE JUDGE IMPOSE?  The Federal Trade Commission has broad leeway in requesting a remedy, and asked the judge to force Facebook to divest assets, potentially including Instagram and WhatsApp.  It also asked the judge to order Facebook to stop requiring small companies on its platform to not compete with it.  WHAT DOES FACEBOOK SAY ABOUT THESE ALLEGATIONS?  Facebook said it is reviewing the FTC and state antitrust complaints.  The company said the government \u201cnow wants a do-over with no regard for the impact that precedent would have on the broader business community or the people who choose our products every day.\u201d  HOW LONG WOULD A TRIAL AND APPEALS TAKE?  While court hearings to determine if a merger should be stopped can be relatively quick, in this case, the run-up to a trial or trials and the proceedings themselves could last a year or more. A decision could come months after that, antitrust experts said.  ARE THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST FACEBOOK POLITICALLY MOTIVATED?  President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has been angry with several Silicon Valley companies for allegedly silencing conservatives, and many Republican lawmakers have brought up the issue of bias during recent antitrust congressional hearings.  Facebook notably clashed with the administration when it added disclaimers to Trump\u2019s posts, including those that cast doubt on the fairness of the 2020 presidential election.","12":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc said on Wednesday that new rules and product changes aimed at protecting users\u2019 privacy would slow its revenue growth into next year and significantly raise expenses, taking the shine off quarterly revenue results that beat expectations.  The outlook was the latest twist in a day of contrasting news for the world\u2019s largest social media company. Facebook earlier agreed to pay $5 billion to settle a U.S. Federal Trade Commission data privacy probe but then disclosed that the regulator was now investigating it for anti-competitive behavior.  The settlement, which lawmakers and privacy experts criticized as a \u201cslap on the wrist\u201d for a company whose revenues last year topped $55 billion, suggested that Facebook had moved past a major regulatory challenge that has dogged it over the last year.  But Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, Dave Wehner, warned that operational changes required by the settlement would be costly. In addition, he said, revenue will be hurt by new limits on usage of consumer data being set by governments around the world and by tech companies on whose systems Facebook relies. He did not elaborate.  The guidance demonstrates the lasting effects of Facebook\u2019s failure over the last decade to adequately secure some users\u2019 personal information and inform users how its business partners were accessing the data.  Still, Facebook said the second straight quarter of above-expectations revenue showed that its namesake app is producing growth even as users gravitate toward newer, more private features whose popularity has outstripped their usage among advertisers.  Second-quarter revenue rose to $16.9 billion from $13.2 billion a year ago, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $16.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Shares of Facebook, which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, rose 0.87% after hours to $206.44 after whipsawing amid the results and guidance. The shares have recouped most of the losses sparked a year ago on concerns of slowing usage and the costs of improving privacy.  For the quarter, Facebook reported 2.7 billion monthly users and 2.1 billion daily users across Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, both figures about the same as last quarter.  \u201cNews regarding FTC and data privacy, along with antitrust investigations and additional headline risks [are] likely to continue to hang over the stock, but it looks like the platform still remains a very popular destination for the users,\u201d Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi said in an email to Reuters.  U.S. PROBES  Facebook has faced questions for the past three years from regulators and users worldwide over how services designed to share news and events with friends and family have become platforms for spreading misinformation about politics and health. It also suffered data breaches, prompting investigations in several countries.  The FTC inquiry settled on Wednesday stemmed from allegations that Facebook allowed information belonging to 87 million users to be inappropriately shared with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.  Facebook, which had set aside $3 billion in the first quarter for the settlement, said it took a $2 billion charge in the second quarter to account for the remainder.  The deal, which is subject to court approval, also requires Facebook to document for the FTC any privacy-related decisions about new products. It must establish a privacy committee on its board, and executives must regularly attest to the company\u2019s proper handling of user content.  Wehner said the settlement would require \u201csignificant investment\u201d in hiring and technology.  The newly disclosed antitrust probe, which Facebook said it learned of from the FTC last month, shows that other regulatory hurdles remain.  FILE PHOTO: Attendees walk past a Facebook logo during Facebook Inc's F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S., April 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam\/File Photo  Reuters and other news agencies reported in June that the FTC was gearing up to investigate complaints about the massive market power of Facebook and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google.  But Facebook on Wednesday suggested it may also be in the crosshairs of the Justice Department, acknowledging in a statement the agency\u2019s announcement a day earlier of an antitrust review of large internet companies. The Justice Department did not specify targets, and Facebook declined to elaborate.  Facebook has expanded programs and promises in response to political pressure on several issues, including policing objectionable content.  Costs jumped 66% compared to a year ago, to nearly $12.3 billion, as Facebook continues to ramp up such initiatives.  The FTC payment in part cut second-quarter profit to $2.6 billion, compared with $5.1 billion a year earlier. Excluding the settlement and a $1.1 billion one-time tax expense, earnings would have been $1.99 per share, Facebook said.  The expectations for its ad business and cost forecasts could hurt profit margins, particularly in the fourth quarter, Facebook said.","13":"Slideshow ( 3 images )  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and an industry group backed by Amazon, Facebook Inc and Google have sued Maryland over new its new online advertising tax aimed at funding education, the Washington Post reported on Thursday.

Representations of virtual currency are displayed in front of the Libra logo in this illustration picture, June 21, 2019. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  Gita Gopinath told reporters the International Monetary Fund was flagging risks and concerns about Facebook\u2019s plans, and said it was important for regulators to pay close attention to such developments.  \u201cIt is very important for regulatory agencies in the world to pay close attention to these developments and to make sure that they are not too late in undertaking the right steps,\u201d Gopinath said.  On Wednesday, members of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee are questioning David Marcus, the Facebook executive overseeing the Libra project. Marcus was grilled on Tuesday by the U.S. Senate Banking Committee over the possible risks posed by Libra to data privacy, consumer protections and money laundering controls.  The social media company is seeking to win over Washington after it shocked regulators and lawmakers with its June 18 announcement that it hopes to launch a new digital coin called Libra in 2020.  Policymakers and financial watchdogs in the United States and elsewhere fear widespread adoption of the digital currency by Facebook\u2019s 2.38 billion users could upend the financial system.  Gopinath said the Fund favored expanded financial inclusion, and digital currencies could play a role in that process.  But she said there were also important questions about consumer protection, data privacy, the impact on monetary policy and other issues.  \u201cIf you look particularly at countries that are not reserve currency countries, would this lead to backdoor dollarization?\u201d she said. \u201cAll of these questions (and) whether there will be enough checks and balances in place to prevent money laundering ... are very important.\u201d  Facebook is one of 28 founding members of the Libra Association which will be headquartered in Geneva and which is in talks with Swiss regulatory authorities about a framework.","15":"LONDON (Reuters) - British banks hold enough capital to cope with a no-deal Brexit and a global trade war simultaneously, the Bank of England said on Thursday, although a disruptive Brexit would still cause major turbulence for financial markets and the economy.  Bank of England Governor Mark Carney also flagged ongoing concerns about illiquid investment funds, liquidity shocks, crypto-currencies and environmental dangers at a half-yearly update on the risks facing Britain\u2019s banking system.  Carney said while banks were well prepared for Brexit, this did not mean the economy would be unscathed if Britain left the European Union on Oct. 31 without a transition deal, something both contenders to be the next prime minister say is possible.  \u201cFinancial stability is not the same as market stability,\u201d Carney told a news conference.  \u201cIn a disorderly Brexit, a range of UK asset prices would be expected to adjust sharply, tightening financial conditions for UK households and businesses.\u201d  The BoE noted a sharp fall in foreign investors buying British commercial property and some company loans.  \u201cThere has been a deterioration in the quality of inflows ... that are financing the current account deficit,\u201d Carney said, adding that it was crucial Britain remained an attractive investment destination after Brexit.  TRADE TENSIONS  The BoE said trade tensions between the United States and China had increased global financial risks and there was a rising number of heavily indebted companies in the United States, continental Europe and elsewhere.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  British banks were better prepared for a downturn than they were before the 2008 financial crisis when they held much less capital and required multi-billion-pound bailouts.  \u201cThe system would continue to serve UK households and businesses even if worst-case disorderly Brexit occurred at the same time as a global slowdown triggered by a trade war,\u201d Carney said.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  The BoE also said it would look at the risk posed by the use of so-called \u2018tokens\u2019 and other assets used to make payments outside the mainstream financial system.  Last month Facebook FB.O drew worldwide interest when it announced plans to establish its own payment system, backed up by a currency it calls Libra.  Carney said Facebook would need to get issues such as operational stability and anti-money laundering checks right first time, unlike the approach taken in other, less sensitive areas of technology.  Banks\u2019 ability to withstand liquidity shocks would also be put under the microscope later this year, the BoE said, though it added that it did not intend to tighten liquidity rules.  British-based banks already hold 1 trillion pounds in liquid assets to cope with a disorderly Brexit or other shocks.  The Bank of England\u2019s Financial Policy Committee (FPC), said it would team up with Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority to assess whether investment funds should be required to set lengthier withdrawal periods for investors if they hold hard-to-sell assets such as commercial property.  This follows the suspension in June of a fund from Neil Woodford, one of Britain\u2019s best known money managers, which was unable to meet withdrawal demands from clients.","16":"WASHINGTON\/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - WhatsApp sued Israeli surveillance firm NSO Group on Tuesday, accusing it of helping government spies break into the phones of roughly 1,400 users across four continents in a hacking spree whose targets included diplomats, political dissidents, journalists and senior government officials.  In a lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco, messaging service WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook Inc FB.O, accused NSO of facilitating government hacking sprees in 20 countries. Mexico, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain were the only countries identified.  WhatsApp said in a statement that 100 civil society members had been targeted, and called it \u201can unmistakable pattern of abuse.\u201d  NSO denied the allegations.  \u201cIn the strongest possible terms, we dispute today\u2019s allegations and will vigorously fight them,\u201d NSO said in a statement. \u201cThe sole purpose of NSO is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime.\u201d  WhatsApp said the attack exploited its video calling system in order to send malware to the mobile devices of a number of users. The malware would allow NSO\u2019s clients - said to be governments and intelligence organizations - to secretly spy on a phone\u2019s owner, opening their digital lives up to official scrutiny.  WhatsApp is used by some 1.5 billion people monthly and has often touted a high level of security, including end-to-end encrypted messages that cannot be deciphered by WhatsApp or other third parties.  FILE PHOTO: Men pose with smartphones in front of displayed Whatsapp logo in this illustration September 14, 2017. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  Citizen Lab, a cybersecurity research laboratory based at the University of Toronto that worked with WhatsApp to investigate the phone hacking, told Reuters that the targets included well-known television personalities, prominent women who had been subjected to online hate campaigns and people who had faced \u201cassassination attempts and threats of violence.\u201d  Neither Citizen Lab nor WhatsApp identified the targets by name.  Governments have increasingly turned to sophisticated hacking software as officials seek to push their surveillance power into the furthest corners of their citizens\u2019 digital lives.  Companies like NSO say their technology enables officials to circumvent the encryption that increasingly protects the data held on phones and other devices. But governments only rarely talk about their capabilities publicly, meaning that the digital intrusions like the ones that affected WhatsApp typically happen in the shadows.  UNPRECEDENTED MOVE  Lawyer Scott Watnik called WhatsApp\u2019s move \u201centirely unprecedented,\u201d explaining that major service providers tended to shy away from litigation for fear of \u201copening up the hood\u201d and revealing too much about their digital security. He said other firms would be watching the progress of the suit with interest.  \u201cIt could certainly set a precedent,\u201d said Watnik, who chairs the cybersecurity practice at the Wilk Auslander law firm in New York.  The lawsuit seeks to have NSO barred from accessing or attempting to access WhatsApp and Facebook\u2019s services and seeks unspecified damages.  NSO\u2019s phone hacking software has already been implicated in a series of human rights abuses across Latin America and the Middle East, including a sprawling espionage scandal in Panama and an attempt to spy on an employee of the London-based rights group Amnesty International.  NSO came under particularly harsh scrutiny over the allegation that its spyware played a role in the death of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul a little over a year ago.  Khashoggi\u2019s friend Omar Abdulaziz is one of seven activists and journalists who have taken the spyware firm to court in Israel and Cyprus over allegations that their phones were compromised using NSO technology. Amnesty has also filed a lawsuit, demanding that the Israeli Ministry of Defense revoke NSO\u2019s export license to \u201cstop it profiting from state-sponsored repression.\u201d  NSO has recently tried to clean up its image after it was bought by London-based private equity firm Novalpina Capital earlier this year. In August, NSO co-founder Shalev Hulio appeared on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and boasted his spyware had saved \u201ctens of thousands of people.\u201d He provided no details.  NSO has also brought on a series of high-profile advisers, including former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge and Juliette Kayyem, a senior lecturer in international security at Harvard University. Last month, NSO announced it would begin abiding by U.N. guidelines on human rights abuses.","17":"(Corrects headline and story to say Apple asks or directs developers on login button placement, not Apple forces or requires. Corrects sourcing in paragraph 6 to Apple guidelines, not Apple.)  June 4 (Reuters) - Apple Inc will ask developers to position a new \u201cSign on with Apple\u201d button in iPhone and iPad apps above rival buttons from Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Facebook Inc, according to design guidelines released this week.  The move to give Apple prime placement is significant because users often select the default or top option on apps. And Apple will require apps to offer its button if they want to offer options to login with Facebook or Google.  Apple unveiled its login button on Monday, emphasizing users\u2019 privacy and also introducing a feature that randomly generates an email address to avoid revealing the person\u2019s true email.  Many consumers choose to sign in to independent apps using their accounts from Google or Facebook because it saves the trouble of having to create and remember separate user names and passwords for dozens of different apps.  But the login buttons can send some data back to their makers about the user\u2019s app habits. Apple\u2019s software chief Craig Federighi said during a keynote address on Monday that Apple was seeking to give users a more private option and developers a way to offer a fast one-step login without sending their user\u2019s data to another company.  Apple\u2019s guidelines do not appear to impose requirements on apps that have their own dedicated login system and do not use third-party buttons from Google or Facebook, such as apps from game maker Nintendo Co Ltd. Apple\u2019s button also works on websites. Its use will not be required because Apple does not hold review power over websites the way it does apps on its own store, but Apple\u2019s guidelines still ask it to be given top placement if it is used.  Apple declined to comment further beyond its executives\u2019 public remarks on Sign in with Apple. Facebook and Google declined to comment on the move, though Google said it does not require use of Google\u2019s login button for apps in its Play Store on Android devices.  Apple\u2019s guidelines to developers around login tools come as developers and rivals have alleged that some of its App Store practices, such as taking a commission of up to 30% of sales made through the store, are anticompetitive.  United States antitrust regulators are also laying the ground for a potential antitrust review of Apple and other major technology companies, Reuters reported Monday. In an interview with CBS News that aired on Tuesday, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said it was \u201cfair\u201d for regulators to scrutinize Apple given its size but said the company is not a monopoly in any of the markets it operates in.","18":"FILE PHOTO: Persons hold smartphones with the Facebook logo in front of displayed \"top secret\" and \"email\" words in this picture illustration taken December 6, 2018.

Facebook has talked with FTC staff about the investigation, one of the people familiar with the matter told the Post.

Facebook declined to comment.  The FTC, which is affected by the U.S. government shutdown, did not immediately respond to a request to comment. Generally secretive, it took the unusual step last March of announcing the opening of an investigation into Facebook\u2019s privacy practices.  The announcement followed news reports that revealed lax oversight by the social media company had enabled a quiz app on Facebook to gather details on 87 million users and share it with now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.

The blunt comments came after a short meeting with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and two days before Breton is due to present the first of a raft of rules to rein in U.S. tech giants and state-aided Chinese companies.  \u201cIt\u2019s not for us to adapt to this company, it\u2019s for this company to adapt to us,\u201d Breton, a former CEO at French telecoms provider Orange and French technology company Atos, told reporters after the meeting.  Zuckerberg had earlier told reporters he had a good, wide-ranging conversation with Breton.  Breton also said he would decide by the end of the year whether to adopt tough rules as part of the digital services act to regulate online platforms and set out their responsibilities.  He dismissed a discussion paper issued by Facebook on Monday that rejects what it calls intrusive regulations and suggests looser rules whereby companies would periodicially report content and publish enforcement data.  \u201cIt\u2019s not enough,\u201d Breton said, adding that Facebook had omitted any mention of its market dominance and also failed to spell out its responsibilities.

FILE PHOTO: Representations of the Ripple, Bitcoin, Etherum and Litecoin virtual currencies are seen on a PC motherboard in this illustration picture, February 14, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The criticism came as the European Central Bank said it was working on a long-term plan to launch a public digital currency that could make projects such as Libra redundant.  Virtual currencies pose risks to consumers, financial stability and even \u201cthe monetary sovereignty\u201d of European states, France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, and his German counterpart, Olaf Scholz, said in a joint statement issued at a meeting of euro zone finance ministers in Helsinki.  \u201cFrance and Germany consider that the Libra project, as set out in Facebook\u2019s blueprint, fails to convince that those risks will be properly addressed,\u201d they said.  The 19-country euro zone bloc is united in pursuing a tough regulatory approach should Libra seek authorizations to operate in Europe, officials said at the meeting.  It is also considering a common set of rules for virtual currencies, which are currently largely unregulated.  The currency union has worked in past years on several plans to make digital payments cheaper and faster, but none of them has properly taken off so far.  The Libra Association, a 28-member organization Facebook is setting up in Switzerland to manage the currency, said it welcomed the feedback.  Members \u201care committed to working with regulatory authorities to achieve a safe, transparent and consumer-focused implementation of the Libra project,\u201d Dante Disparte, the group\u2019s head of policy and communications, said in a statement.  WAKE-UP CALL  Plans unveiled in June by U.S. social media giant Facebook to launch its own digital currency, Libra, for payments among its hundreds of millions of users in Europe and around the world have triggered a rethink.  Libra was \u201ca wake-up call\u201d, European Central Bank (ECB) board member Benoit Coeure told a news conference in Helsinki after a meeting of euro zone finance ministers.  He said Libra had revived efforts to widen the uptake of an ECB-backed project for real-time payments in the euro zone, known as TIPS. The project, launched last year, has been met with caution by banks.  \u201cWe also need to step up our thinking on a central bank digital currency,\u201d he added, unveiling a so far little-known plan.  An ECB official said the project could allow consumers to use electronic cash, which would be directly deposited at the ECB, without need for bank accounts, financial intermediaries or clearing counterparties.  These actors are all needed now to process digital payments, but may no longer be necessary if the ECB took over their functions, slashing transaction costs. Libra\u2019s plan also would do without financial intermediaries.  Work on the ECB project started before the launch of Libra and could last months or even years, Coeure said. The technical feasibility remains to be seen and opposition from banks is likely. He will present a report on virtual currencies to G7 finance ministers next month, officials said.  Le Maire said one of the purposes of this initiative was to make sure that banks reduce fees on international payments.  \u201cWe encourage European central banks to accelerate work on issues around possible public digital currency solutions,\u201d Le Maire said in the joint statement with Germany\u2019s Scholz.  LEGAL LIMBO  While euro zone ministers seem united on a tough regulatory line on Libra, it is less clear whether they agree to set up common rules for virtual currencies.  The EU\u2019s financial services commissioner, Latvia\u2019s Valdis Dombrovskis, is always careful to underline that cryptoassets are an opportunity as much as a threat.  The EU does not have specific regulations on cryptocurrencies, which until Libra was unveiled had been considered a marginal issue by most decision-makers because only a tiny fraction of bitcoins or other digital coins are converted into euros.  New EU-wide rules came into force last year to increase checks on virtual currencies\u2019 trading venues with the purpose of reducing risks of money laundering and other financial crime.  But apart from that, virtual currencies move in what is largely a legal limbo in the EU, as regulators have not yet managed to agree on whether to treat them as securities, payment services or currencies in themselves - the latter option being ruled out by most.  In the absence of specific regulations, EU officials are assessing whether existing rules governing financial instruments could apply, but have so far reached no conclusion.  When asked whether Libra would need a license to operate in the EU, a spokeswoman for the European Commission told Reuters that an authorization would likely be necessary. But \u201cwith the publicly available information on Libra, it is currently not possible to say which exact EU rules would apply,\u201d she added.  In Switzerland, Libra is applying for a payment service license, although it could face rules that typically apply to banks, regulators in the non-EU Alpine state said on Wednesday.  The EU-wide legal vacuum has paved the way for smaller states to fill it. Tiny Malta, which already hosts the bloc\u2019s largest online gambling industry and an outsized finance sector, has devised its own framework to attract virtual currency operators.  It is unclear whether Malta and other smaller EU states would agree with Le Maire\u2019s tough stance on Libra and cryptocurrencies.","24":"(Reuters) - When the CEOs of Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google testify before the U.S. House committee dedicated to antitrust on Wednesday, they will address lawmakers to whom their companies and employees have given a collective $67,300 in this election cycle.

Your emphatic answer was no,\u201d Peters wrote in a letter to Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg. \u201cIf these reports are accurate, I am concerned that your previous testimony before Congress appears to have been, at best, incomplete.\u201d  Facebook did not immediately comment.  The letter noted that Facebook later submitted written responses to Congress that it does in fact access users\u2019 audio when they have opted in and used a specific Facebook service.  However, Peters pointed out that the company did not, in follow-up responses, \u201carticulate what you do with the audio accessed under those circumstances, the extent of Facebook\u2019s use of this practice or the reasons for the discrepancy in your testimony on this issue during the hearing.\u201d  Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission, Facebook\u2019s lead regulator in the European Union, said on Wednesday it sought information on how the company handled data during the manual transcription of users\u2019 audio recordings.  The commission already has eight individual probes into the U.S. social media company, two into its WhatsApp subsidiary, and one into Facebook-owned Instagram.  \u201cMuch like Apple and Google, we paused human review of audio more than a week ago,\u201d Facebook said earlier this week.  Under the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation privacy rules, regulators can fine violators up to 4% of a company\u2019s global revenue or 20 million euros ($22 million), whichever is higher.  Facebook until recently carried out human reviews of private audio from its Messenger app to improve transcriptions by artificial intelligence systems, but no EU users were affected, the company said this week.  The audio clips in question were masked to avoid revealing anyone\u2019s identity and the company never listened to people\u2019s microphones without explicit activation, a Facebook representative said in an email on Wednesday, adding that human reviews were common in the industry.  Facebook has faced broad criticism from lawmakers and regulators over its privacy practices and received renewed criticism after Bloomberg on Tuesday reported that Facebook used outside contractors to transcribe the clips.  Last month the company agreed to a record-setting $5 billion privacy settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. The settlement is awaiting court approval.

Sweden and Norway have traditionally had low electricity prices, making them attractive locations for power-hungry data centres that big digital companies need for their operations.  Microsoft recently announced plans to build two data centres in Norway and Facebook last month decided to expand its data centre in Sweden\u2019s northern city of Lulea, strengthening its Nordic operations.  But power prices in Sweden and Norway are now double those of 2017 as inflows of water to hydropower reservoirs are expected to decline this year.  Facebook spokeswoman Camilla Nordsted said: \u201cWe take a long-term view towards our investments and the ingredients that make them successful.\u201d  She said the company would not be affected by unusual short-term power price levels in the region, as Facebook had signed a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with three new wind farms in Norway.  \u201cThe 15-year PPA term provides the long-term financial certainty necessary for the projects to be financed, constructed and operated,\u201d she said.  In June, power prices in Norway surged above 45 euros per megawatt hour, double year on year, but the price is only one of the variables Facebook is considering.  \u201cSupportive state and local partners, a shovel-ready site, good access to fibre and power, access to renewable energy, a strong pool of talent for construction and operations staff,\u201d are important things to consider, Nordsted said.  Facebook is working on evaluating a number of potential new sites for its operations that it aims to power with carbon-free energy, Nordsted said, but she declined to identify specific plans at this stage.  Outside the United States, Facebook currently has or has planned data centres in Ireland, Sweden and Denmark, according to data published by the company.  Norway and Sweden recently lowered their data centre taxes to attract more investments in the region, which is rich in power from renewable energy sources such as hydropower dams and wind farms.","27":"May 31 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge ordered Facebook Inc to give shareholders emails and other records concerning how the social media company handles data privacy, after data for an estimated 87 million users was accessed by the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.  In a decision on Thursday, Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of the Delaware Chancery Court said shareholders demonstrated a \u201ccredible basis\u201d to infer that Facebook board members may have committed wrongdoing in connection with data privacy breaches.  He noted that Facebook had, at the time of the 2015 Cambridge Analytica breach, been subject to a consent decree with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, under which the Menlo Park, California-based company promised to bolster its data security measures.  Facebook and its lawyers did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment. Lawyers for the shareholders did not immediately respond to similar requests.  Allegations of improper use of Facebook user data by Cambridge Analytica, hired by Donald Trump's 2016 U.S. election campaign, prompted a series of U.S. and European regulatory probes. The breach was disclosed in March 2018 and Cambridge later shut down here.  Shareholders said they sued Facebook in September to obtain records related to Cambridge Analytica and other breaches, and upon finding wrongdoing might later sue company officers and directors through a so-called derivative lawsuit.  In a footnote, Slights said his decision stopped \u201cwell short\u201d of concluding that officers or directors engaged in wrongdoing, and any such determination \u201cawaits another day.\u201d (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum)","28":"WASHINGTON\/NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are set to grill Facebook Inc on its cryptocurrency plans on Tuesday, as the project continues to draw intense scrutiny from financial regulators and politicians across the globe.  Facebook is fighting a rearguard action to get Washington onside after it shocked regulators and lawmakers with an announcement on June 18 that it was hoping to launch a new digital coin called Libra in 2020.  Since then it has faced a barrage of criticism from policymakers and financial watchdogs at home and abroad who fear widespread adoption of the digital currency by the social media giant\u2019s 2.38 billion users could upend the financial system.  Critics have expressed anger that the company would have got so far in its plans for such a potentially groundbreaking project without extensive input from policymakers, especially when it is already in the spotlight over privacy issues.  The Senate Banking Committee will question David Marcus, the company\u2019s top executive overseeing the project, on issues ranging from how Libra could affect global monetary policy to how customer data will be handled.  Marcus, who was president of PayPal from 2012 to 2014, will try to assuage concerns by promising that Facebook will not begin offering Libra until regulatory issues are addressed, according to prepared testimony the committee posted on Monday.  \u201cWe know we need to take the time to get this right,\u201d Marcus, who is also due to testify before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, will say.  Marcus is likely to get a frosty reception from Democratic lawmakers who already believe the company is too large and careless with consumer data.  He is also likely to face skepticism from Republicans after President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also voiced concerns.  \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to convince us of very high standards before they have access to the U.S. financial system,\u201d Mnuchin said on Monday.  UNDER WRAPS  Facebook allocated a small fraction of its vast workforce to work on the project, Kevin Weil, who runs product for the Libra initiative, told Reuters on June 18.  One former employee told Reuters the company tried to keep the project under wraps even internally - staff who were not involved knew little about it, not even that it was operating under the name Libra.  Rumors had surfaced as early as last year that Facebook was working on a digital currency, but news that the project was in its advanced stages started to emerge only in recent months.  In the weeks leading up to the announcement, the company began reaching out formally to key regulators including the Federal Reserve, the Treasury and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But two people with knowledge of the discussions said the conversations remained vague, with key details of the project discussed only on a theoretical level.  Some lawmakers specializing in financial services policy have been frustrated by the lack of clarity from Facebook before and since June 18, three congressional sources said.  For example, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee sent Facebook a letter on May 9 seeking information, including how the company would protect consumers\u2019 financial information. But Facebook did not write back until July 8, the committee said.  After receiving the response, the lead Democrat on the panel, Senator Sherrod Brown, said in a statement he still needed \u201creal answers.\u201d  One Democratic aide described the company\u2019s contacts with lawmakers as \u201cinept and entitled.\u201d  In its defense, Facebook has said that it announced the project in its early stages to get feedback from stakeholders.

REUTERS\/Blair Gable  The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is working on a common approach to ensure digital behemoths, such as Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Facebook Inc, pay their share of taxes as the coronavirus hammers budgets.  Canada said it was concerned about a delay in reaching agreement. The threat of digital services taxes has prompted threats of trade retaliation from outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.  The new tax would come into effect on Jan. 1, 2022, and remain in place until a common approach is agreed upon. The measure would raise federal revenues by C$3.4 billion ($2.6 billion) over five years, starting in the 2021-22 fiscal year.  \u201cCanadians want a tax system that is fair, where everyone pays their fair share,\u201d Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland told legislators in the fall economic update.  \u201cCanada will act unilaterally, if necessary, to apply a tax on large multinational digital corporations, so they pay their fair share just like any other company operating in Canada.\u201d  More details are due in next year\u2019s budget.  Foreign-based vendors with no physical presence in Canada will also have to start collecting sales taxes on products such as mobile apps, online video gaming and streaming. The measure should raise C$1.2 billion over five years.  Ottawa also plans to oblige people renting out short-term accommodation to charge sales taxes, saying popular digital rental platforms do not currently have to impose the taxes. That  puts hotels at a disadvantage, it added.  The government is also clamping down on the award of stock options to prevent \u201chigh-income individuals employed at large, long-established, mature firms\u201d from taking unfair advantage.  From now on, a C$200,000 annual limit will apply to stock option grants for those people. Ottawa did not provide a definition of high-income individuals or mature firms.  The rules will not apply to startups or emerging companies, which often cannot afford to pay competitive salaries and instead offer stock options. The new rules will generate about C$200 million in federal revenues, the Finance Department said.

The proposed rules, to be announced by EU digital chief Thierry Breton and EU antitrust czar Margrethe Vestager on Tuesday, are likely to affect Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet unit Google.  The rules, known as the Digital Markets Act, set out a list of dos and don\u2019ts for online gatekeepers to ensure a level playing field for rivals and users.

Facebook FB.O shares closed down nearly 7 percent on Monday, wiping nearly $40 billion off its market value as investors worried that damage to the reputation of the world's largest social media network would deter users and advertisers.  Elizabeth Denham, the head of Britain\u2019s Information Commission, is seeking a warrant to search the offices of consultancy Cambridge Analytica after a whistleblower revealed it had harvested the private information of millions of people to support Trump\u2019s 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.  \u201cWe are looking at whether or not Facebook secured and safeguarded personal information on the platform and whether when they found out about the loss of the data they acted robustly and whether or not people were informed,\u201d Denham told BBC Radio.  U.S. and European lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how the consulting firm gained access to the data in 2014 and why Facebook failed to inform its users, raising broader industry questions about consumer privacy.  In Washington, the Republican chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee sent a letter on Monday to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg requesting information and a briefing on the Facebook user data.  \u201cThe possibility that Facebook has either not been transparent with consumers or has not been able to verify that third party app developers are transparent with consumers is troubling,\u201d read the letter which was also addressed to Nigel Oakes, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s affiliate SCL.  Bloomberg reported that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is investigating Facebook. Its shares fell a further 1.8 percent.  In London, the head of Britain\u2019s cross-party Media parliamentary committee also wrote to Zuckerberg asking for more information. \u201cWe would like to receive your response by Monday 26 March,\u201d lawmaker Damian Collins wrote.  In Dublin, Ireland\u2019s privacy watchdog said it was following up with Facebook to clarify its oversight. The Irish body is the lead regulator for Facebook in the European Union because the network\u2019s European headquarters are in Dublin.  Created in 2013, Cambridge Analytica markets itself as a source of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients.  According to the New York Times, it was launched with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by the-then future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon.  Facebook says the data were harvested by a British academic, Aleksandr Kogan, who created an app on the platform that was downloaded by 270,000 people, providing access not only to their own personal data but also their friends\u2019.  Facebook said Kogan then violated its policies by passing the data to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook has since suspended both the consulting firm and SCL (Strategic Communication Laboratories), a government and military contractor.  Facebook said it had been told that the data were destroyed.  Kogan says he changed the terms and conditions of his personality-test app on Facebook from academic to commercial part way through the project, according to an email to Cambridge University colleagues obtained and cited by CNN.  Kogan says Facebook made no objection, but Facebook says it was not informed of the change, CNN reported. Kogan was not immediately reachable for comment.

Cambridge Analytica has denied all the media claims and said it deleted the data after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.  On Tuesday people were seen carrying multiple plastic storage containers into and out of the building that houses Cambridge Analytica\u2019s London office, among other companies. It was not clear which firm they were going to.  Slideshow ( 9 images )  \u201cWe are not alone in using data from social media sites to extract user information,\u201d Cambridge Analytica said. \u201cNo Facebook data was used by our data science team in the 2016 presidential campaign.\u201d  Denham, head of the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) said on Monday she was seeking a warrant to access the offices of Cambridge Analytica after seeing an investigation by Britain\u2019s Channel 4 news which secretly recorded its executives boasting of their ability to sway elections.  She said it would not take long to obtain the warrant.  \u201cWe have offered to share with the ICO all the information that it asked for and for the ICO to attend our office voluntarily, subject to our agreeing the scope of the inspection,\u201d Cambridge Analytica said.  Facebook said it had hired forensic auditors from the firm Stroz Friedberg to investigate and determine whether Cambridge Analytica still had the data. The auditors were in Cambridge Analytica\u2019s offices on Monday night but left at the request of the British authorities.  The Information Commissioner can currently impose fines of up to 500,000 pounds ($700,000) but will gain the power to fine an organization up to 4 percent of its global turnover when new data protection legislation comes into force in May.  The criticism of Cambridge Analytica presents a new threat to Facebook, which is already under attack over Russia\u2019s alleged use of Facebook tools to sway U.S. voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election.  \u201cThis story comes on the back of increasing scrutiny and societal unease with FB\u2019s potential impact on kids as well as increasing concerns around the power of mega cap Internet names, setting the stage for deeper investigation,\u201d Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley wrote in a note, keeping his \u201cbuy\u201d rating on Facebook stock.  Walmsley said he was worried \u201cabout how scrutiny could ultimately impact Facebook\u2019s ability to gather and deploy data for ad targeting, which has been critical to ad efficacy and budget growth\u201d.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Sources familiar with WhatsApp\u2019s internal investigation into the breach said a \u201csignificant\u201d portion of the known victims are high-profile government and military officials spread across at least 20 countries on five continents. Many of the nations are U.S. allies, they said.  The hacking of a wider group of top government officials\u2019 smartphones than previously reported suggests the WhatsApp cyber intrusion could have broad political and diplomatic consequences.  WhatsApp filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against Israeli hacking tool developer NSO Group. The Facebook-owned software giant alleges that NSO Group built and sold a hacking platform that exploited a flaw in WhatsApp-owned servers to help clients hack into the cellphones of at least 1,400 users between April 29, 2019, and May 10, 2019.  The total number of WhatsApp users hacked could be even higher. A London-based human rights lawyer, who was among the targets, sent Reuters photographs showing attempts to break into his phone dating back to April 1.  While it is not clear who used the software to hack officials\u2019 phones, NSO has said it sells its spyware exclusively to government customers.  Some victims are in the United States, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Mexico, Pakistan and India, said people familiar with the investigation. Reuters could not verify whether the government officials were from those countries or elsewhere.  Some Indian nationals have gone public with allegations they were among the targets over the past couple of days; they include journalists, academics, lawyers and defenders of India\u2019s Dalit community.  NSO said in a statement that it was \u201cnot able to disclose who is or is not a client or discuss specific uses of its technology.\u201d Previously it has denied any wrongdoing, saying its products are only meant to help governments catch terrorists and criminals.  Cybersecurity researchers have cast doubt on those claims over the years, saying NSO products were used against a wide range of targets, including protesters in countries under authoritarian rule.  Citizen Lab, an independent watchdog group that worked with WhatsApp to identify the hacking targets, said on Tuesday at least 100 of the victims were civil society figures such as journalists and dissidents, not criminals.

Unveiled by EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager and EU industry chief Thierry Breton in December last year, the two sets of rules are known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA).  DMA takes aim at online gatekeepers which will be subject to a list of dos such as sharing some data with rivals and regulators and don\u2019ts among them not favouring their own services on their platforms.  The DSA requires large online platforms and other internet players to do more to tackle illegal content, be more transparent about political advertising on their platforms.

EDPS said gatekeepers should provide an easy and accessible way for users to consent or decline the use of their personal data by the companies for their other services, and that there should be tests to ensure personal data is effectively anonymous.  On the DSA, the agency said profiling of users for content moderation purposes should be banned and that online targeted advertising should be phased out and banned in the case of pervasive tracking while some data should be shielded from targeted advertising.  The proposed European Commission rules will need to be discussed with EU countries and EU lawmakers before they become law, a process which will take 16-24 months.","38":"MEXICO CITY, Feb 8 (Reuters) - A prominent senator from Mexico\u2019s ruling party has proposed regulating major social media networks, including Twitter and Facebook, in a draft bill seen by Reuters on Monday.

Britain\u2019s top financial regulator said there was not yet enough information to understand Libra, adding that it could be very significant for public policy and that would not easily get the go-ahead without further disclosure.  Facebook last week announced plans to launch Libra within the first half of 2020, part of an effort to expand beyond social media to e-commerce and digital payments.  \u201cThey are not going to walk through authorization without that,\u201d Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, told a British parliamentary committee.  Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin remain one of the least-regulated areas of finance, and the response of domestic and international financial regulators and monetary authorities to the Libra project will have a crucial impact on its prospects.  S&P Global Ratings said regulatory hurdles were the main hurdle to Libra\u2019s success, and risked delays to its launch. The coin would likely be subject to differing regulatory approaches, as is the case with existing cryptocurrencies, it said.  \u201cThis level of scrutiny could imply either delays or limited scope in the initial roll-out,\u201d S&P said in a report.  Facebook\u2019s project has raised privacy concerns among U.S. lawmakers and prompted European central bankers to claim oversight to ensure it would not jeopardize the financial system or be used to launder money.  Until now, global central bankers have largely refrained from regulating digital currencies, concluding last year they were too small to pose a risk to the financial system.  Although Facebook\u2019s plan to expand into payments is not expected to be on the agenda of this week\u2019s G20 summit in Japan, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates financial rules for G20 countries, said it could lead regulators to take a closer look at digital assets.  PLAY BY THE RULES  The FCA\u2019s Bailey said the watchdog had been in contact with Facebook, and that many more engagements could be expected, while Domenico Gammaldi, the Bank of Italy\u2019s head of market and payment system oversight, also called for further information.  \u201cThe white paper, that means \u2018white,\u2019 without any information,\u201d Gammaldi told the Crypto Valley Conference in Zug.

France is using its year-long presidency of the Group of Seven nations (G7) to set up a task force to tackle such concerns at an international level.  Other central bankers were more sanguine about the project for which Facebook has recruited 28 partners including Mastercard, PayPal and Uber to form the Geneva-based Libra Association to govern the cryptocurrency.  \u201cI think it\u2019s an interesting development and I\u2019m pretty relaxed about it,\u201d Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the Swiss National Bank\u2019s governing board said.  \u201cThey have clearly indicated that they are willing to play according to the rules, they have been contacting the regulators,\u201d Moser said at the Crypto Valley Conference.  The Bank for International Settlements, an umbrella group for central banks, said on Sunday that greater political coordination was needed to deal with the entry into finance of major tech firms like Facebook.","42":"(Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower on Thursday following a late-session reversal, with Facebook weighing on the market after President Donald Trump said he would sign an executive order related to social media companies and would hold a news conference on China on Friday.

The White House, after the market close, said Trump had signed the order, which removes a liability shield they currently enjoy.  Trump said he was directing Attorney General William Barr to work with states to enforce their own laws against what he described as deceptive business practices by social media companies.  Concerns about China-U.S. relations may also have driven the late decline.

The hearing in Congress proved to be even more tense on Wednesday.

The social media company has said its digital wallet subsidiary Calibra will only share customer data with Facebook or external parties if it has consent, or in limited cases where it is necessary.  Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney pushed Marcus to commit to a Libra pilot program with 1 million users overseen by U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve.  \u201cI don\u2019t think you should launch Libra at all,\u201d Maloney said. \u201cAt the very least you should agree to do this small pilot program.\u201d  Marcus, who was president of PayPal from 2012 to 2014, did not commit to a pilot but tried to assuage lawmakers by pledging not to begin issuing Libra until regulatory concerns had been addressed.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  \u201cWe will take the time to get this right,\u201d Marcus said.  He said the company had unveiled the project at an early stage in order to get feedback from all stakeholders.  \u2018INNOVATION IS GOOD\u2019  While many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle aired concerns and skepticism about the project, several Republicans argued the government should not be reflexively opposed to new ideas from the private sector. Some noted Libra could produce benefits for people lacking traditional banking services.  \u201cWe should presume that innovation is good; it presents enormous opportunity,\u201d said Republican U.S. Representative Andy Barr.  Congress members asked how Facebook will ensure sufficient consumer protection and prevent the cryptocurrency from being used for illegal activities such as money laundering or terrorist financing.  \u201cI\u2019m concerned a 2020 launch date represents deep insensitivities about how Libra could impact U.S. financial security, the global financial system, the privacy of people across the globe, criminal activity and international human rights,\u201d said Republican U.S. Representative Ann Wagner.

At stake are standard contractual clauses used by Facebook, banks, industrial giants, carmakers and others to transfer personal data to the United States and other parts of the world for services ranging from cloud infrastructure, data hosting, payroll and finance to marketing.  Another key issue is whether the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, set up in 2016 to protect Europeans\u2019 personal data transferred across the Atlantic for commercial use, is lawful or not. The same court rejected its predecessor known as Safe Harbour.  If the court finds the mechanisms are illegal, companies could have to suspend the data transfers that underpin standard contractual clauses or face hefty fines for breach of EU privacy laws. Other options are costly and complex and seldom used.  The latest case - C-311\/18 Facebook Ireland and Schrems - came before the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) after Schrems challenged Facebook\u2019s use of standard clauses as lacking sufficient data protection safeguards.  Schrems shot to fame for winning a legal battle in 2015 to overturn Safe Harbour. EU concerns about data transfers mounted after former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations in 2013 of mass U.S. surveillance.  The Irish Data Protection agency, which is Facebook\u2019s lead regulator, took the case to the Irish High Court, which then sought guidance from the CJEU.  Last December a CJEU adviser said such data transfer mechanisms were legal with the caveat that they could be blocked if countries receiving such information fail to meet European data protection standards.  In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), introduced in 2018, seeks to increase individuals\u2019 control over their personal information. Companies that fail to comply are liable to fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover.

FireEye said the Iranian campaign used a network of fake news websites and fraudulent social media personas spread across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google Plus and YouTube, to push narratives in line with Tehran\u2019s interests.  The activity was aimed at users in the United States, Britain, Latin America and the Middle East up to and through this month, FireEye said.

The technology companies variously said they linked the accounts to Iran based on user phone numbers, email addresses, website registration records and the timing of account activity matching Iranian business hours.  FireEye expressed \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d about the Iranian origins but said it has not been able to tie the accounts to a specific organization or individuals.  Hundreds of thousands of people followed one or more of the Facebook pages implicated in the campaign, Facebook said.  It shared examples of removed posts, including a cartoon depicting an Israeli soldier executing a Palestinian and a fake movie poster showing Trump embracing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  Postings cited by FireEye expressed praise for U.S. politicians and other Twitter users who criticized the Trump administration\u2019s decision in May to abandon the Iranian nuclear pact, under which Iran had agreed to curb its nuclear weapons program in exchange for the loosening of sanctions.  Some Twitter and Facebook accounts were designed to appear as if they belonged to real people in the United States, Britain and Canada, according to FireEye. The accounts used a combination of different hashtags to engage in U.S. culture, including \u201c#lockhimup,\u201d \u201c#impeachtrump\u201d and \u201cnotmypresident.\u201d  Twitter, which called the effort \u201ccoordinated manipulation,\u201d said it removed 284 accounts.  Facebook said it removed 254 pages and 392 accounts across its flagship platform as well as its Instagram service.  The accounts spent about $12,000 to advertise through Facebook and Instagram. Facebook said it had notified the U.S. Treasury and State departments of the purchases, which may violate sanctions.  Alphabet, parent company of Google and YouTube, did not respond to a request to comment.","53":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc FB.O said on Monday it had removed two networks of fake accounts linked to digital marketing firms in Egypt and India which were pushing dueling narratives about countries in the Gulf on the Facebook and Instagram platforms.

The operations disseminated content sympathetic to each side of a diplomatic row that has divided the Middle East since 2017, pitting the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt against Qatar. Those countries accuse Qatar of supporting terrorism, which it denies.  Facebook said one network had been posting criticism of Qatar and positive commentary about the UAE. It linked the activity to New Waves and Flexell, two companies in Egypt, which it had already accused of seeding similar narratives last year.  Accounts connected to that operation spent around $48,500 on ads boosting their content and had more than 6 million followers across Facebook and Instagram, a popular photo-sharing app.  Citing the repeated violations, Facebook said it was banning both firms from its platforms.  Graphika, a social media research company which works with Facebook to analyze influence operations, said the operations appeared to be carried out by commercial marketing firms acting at the behest of geopolitical actors with interests in the Gulf, making them part of a pattern of \u201conline influence for hire.\u201d  A smaller network linked to Indian digital marketing firm aRep Global had been using fake accounts to post praise for Qatar and critiques of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, Facebook said in its report.  The accounts posed as local journalists and activists and drove traffic to websites masquerading as local news outlets, Facebook said. It spent less than $450 on ads and had around 100,000 followers across Facebook and Instagram.

Though the company swung to a pretax profit, thanks largely to higher sales at \u201ci\u201d - the cut-price sister title of The Independent newspaper that went digital-only in 2016 - it is still grappling with a 220 million pound ($283 million) debt burden and sector-wide difficulties in boosting online revenue.  \u201cThere are two sets of issues,\u201d Chief Executive David King said.  \u201cThe first is the group\u2019s historical debts, including its pension obligations, which continue to weigh on our balance sheet. The second is the tough market conditions affecting the performance of our newspapers and websites.\u201d  The newspaper industry has struggled in recent years as advertisers migrated to online platforms, prompting cost-cutting measures from Daily Mirror publisher Reach and Daily Mail and General Trust among others.  Online revenue has been a source of hope. Reach, formerly Trinity Mirror, reported a 6 percent rise in like-for-like digital sales at its publishing division in the six months to July 1.  The Daily Mail, however, showed an 8 percent decline in online advertising revenue for the half-year to March 31 despite MailOnline being the most visited UK-based news website.  The fallout from changes in privacy law have affected news sites, with changes to Google\u2019s online search algorithm and Facebook\u2019s news feed lowering Johnston\u2019s digital advertising revenue by 7.4 percent, the results showed.  The struggle with declining revenue at Johnston, which owns more than 200 UK regional newspapers including the Scotsman and the Yorkshire Post, earlier prompted biggest shareholder Custos Group to push for a management shake-up at the publisher.  Johnston\u2019s overall revenue slid to 93 million pounds ($118.6 million) in the six months to June 30, down from 103.3 million pounds in the same period last year.

The company will apply the label to about 200 pages at the outset.  Facebook will not label any U.S.-based news organizations for now, as it determined that even U.S. government-run outlets have editorial independence, Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy, said in an interview.  Facebook, which has acknowledged its failure to stop Russian use of its platforms to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, has since stepped up its defenses and imposed greater transparency requirements for pages and ads on its platforms.  The company announced plans last year to create a state media label, but is introducing it amid criticism over its hands-off treatment of misleading and racially charged posts by U.S. President Donald Trump.  The new measure comes just months ahead of the November U.S. presidential election.

YouTube, owned by Alphabet Inc's Google GOOGL.O, in 2018 started identifying video channels that predominantly carry news items and are funded by governments. But critics charge YouTube has failed to label some state news outlets, allowing them to earn ad revenue from videos with misinformation and propaganda.  In a blog post, Facebook said its label would appear on pages globally, as well as on News Feed posts within the United States.

The companies have sought to distance themselves from the violent storming of the U.S. Capitol by supporters of outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump on Jan. 6, following weeks of toxic rhetoric and organizing online.  Here\u2019s what each company says it is doing:  FACEBOOK  The world\u2019s biggest social media company says it has blocked the creation of any new events near strategic places like the White House, the U.S. Capitol and state capitol buildings through Inauguration Day.  Facebook also re-introduced a measure used after the presidential election that gives added weight in its news feed algorithm to publishers considered authoritative, based on an internal \u201cnews ecosystem quality\u201d scoring system.  Other temporary changes include blocks on the ability of people who have repeatedly violated policies to create events, groups, pages and live videos, as well as stepped-up requirements for users running groups to pre-approve posts.  On Saturday, Facebook said it would prohibit ads for weapon accessories like gun holsters and vests until at least two days after the inauguration, although researchers have spotted such ads even after the ban.  The company suspended Trump at least through Inauguration Day, saying he used Facebook to \u201cincite violent insurrection,\u201d and has no plans to lift the ban even after that.  TWITTER  After the Capitol unrest, Twitter announced steps to limit amplification of tweets violating its election misinformation rules, blocking likes, replies and retweets of those messages.  Users can still quote the tweets, but must add their own comments before sharing, it said.  The company also updated its \u201ccivic integrity\u201d policy to establish a strike-based enforcement system for misleading election claims and purged more than 70,000 accounts for sharing QAnon content.  A Twitter spokeswoman declined to say whether the company was restricting automated content recommendations, such as suggestions for users to follow, or to disclose specific terms being blocked from appearing in \u201ctrending\u201d topics.  On Inauguration Day, Twitter will transfer control of official White House accounts like @WhiteHouse and @POTUS to the Biden administration.  The company permanently suspended Trump\u2019s personal account @realDonaldTrump, citing the risk of further incitement. That account had been his primary megaphone throughout his presidency.  YOUTUBE  YouTube, Alphabet Inc\u2019s video streaming platform, said it has put in place \u201cadditional protective measures\u201d for Inauguration Day, without elaborating.  The company bars live videos that show someone using a firearm, but declined to say whether it was imposing any further restrictions on livestreams or making temporary changes to its systems for recommending content.  On Tuesday, YouTube extended a one-week ban on Trump\u2019s account for at least an additional seven days, citing \u201cconcerns about the ongoing potential for violence.\u201d  PARLER  Parler, which styles itself as a \u201cfree-speech\u201d space, remains largely offline after being dropped by Amazon\u2019s hosting arm and major app stores after the Capitol attack, with partners citing its poor record of policing calls for violence.  A static version of its website returned on Jan. 15 with the help of a Russian-owned technology company and has featured a handful of posts by executives and others, including Fox News host Mark Levin.  Jeffrey Wernick, Parler\u2019s chief operating officer, told Reuters the company was posting those comments on behalf of \u201cfriends who reached out\u201d and had not yet put in place any new content guidelines.  DLIVE  Niche video streaming platform DLive, in the spotlight after far-right personalities used it to broadcast live during the Capitol siege, said it would block all live streams from Washington, D.C. on Jan. 20.  The company, popular with video game streamers, also started proactively reviewing content in the non-gaming \u201cX-tag\u201d section of its site and halted the ability of streamers there to earn money off their videos, it said.  TWITCH  Amazon\u2019s livestreaming platform declined to disclose whether it had put in place any specific measures related to the inauguration.  The company said it removes content that incites or glorifies violence and was monitoring for policy violations. It has carried graphic livestreams of extremist violence before, including shootings in Germany in 2019.  Twitch disabled Trump\u2019s account indefinitely after the Capitol attack and said it would reassess the ban after he leaves office.  SNAPCHAT  Snap Inc maintains it faces fewer problems with extremism and incitement to violence than other platforms because of Snapchat\u2019s design: no open news feed, pre-approval for promoted content and limits on the size of group chats.  A spokeswoman said an internal team is conducting regular proactive sweeps for rules violations around the inauguration, but the platform is not making any other changes.  Snap permanently terminated Trump\u2019s account after the Capitol unrest, \u201cbased on his attempts to spread misinformation, hate speech, and incite violence.\u201d  REDDIT  Reddit did not respond to a request for comment on its plans for inauguration week.  The company had long hosted r\/The_Donald, a popular online home base for Trump fans, but shut down the forum last year for violating hate speech rules.

REUTERS\/Leah Millis  The agreement comes three months after Facebook was hit by a boycott from major advertisers in the wake of anti-racism demonstrations that followed the death of George Floyd, an American Black man, in police custody.  Advertisers have complained for years that big social media companies do too little to prevent ads from appearing alongside hate speech, fake news and other harmful content. Big tech companies, meanwhile, want to be seen as taking action on the issue to fend off calls for more regulation.  Under the deal, announced on Wednesday by the World Federation of Advertisers, common definitions would be adopted for forms of harmful content such as hate speech and bullying, and platforms would adopt harmonised reporting standards.  The platforms agreed to have some practices reviewed by external auditors, and to give advertisers more control of what content is displayed alongside their ads. The deal comes less than six weeks before a polarising U.S. presidential election.  \"This is a significant milestone in the journey to rebuild trust online,\" said Luis Di Como, executive vice president of global media at Unilever ULVR.LUNA.AS, one of the world's biggest advertisers. \"...Whilst change doesn't happen overnight, today marks an important step in the right direction.\"  Carolyn Everson, Vice President for Global Marketing Solutions at Facebook, said the agreement \u201chas aligned the industry on the brand safety floor and suitability framework, giving us all a unified language to move forward on the fight against hate online.\u201d  SCEPTICAL  Campaigners who want more regulation of social media companies have been sceptical of voluntary measures such as those announced on Wednesday.  \u201cAny progress in reducing harmful online content is to be welcomed. However, up to now voluntary action from social media companies has rarely lived up to its initial promises. So time will tell how much of a difference this latest industry-led initiative will make,\u201d David Babbs of UK-based group Clean Up the Internet told Reuters by email.  The Stop Hate for Profit campaign behind the Facebook boycott is backed by the Anti-Defamation League and NAACP, two of the oldest and biggest anti-racism campaign groups in the United States. The campaign did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.  In a statement last week, it said: \u201cFacebook\u2019s failures lead to real-life violence and sow division, and we\u2019re calling on the company to improve its policies.

Facebook said roughly 1.29 billion votes were cast \u201cfor\u201d a proposal that would have the company move to a structure of one vote per share and do away with the supermajority shares, while 4.74 billion shares were voted \u201cagainst\u201d the proposal.  Setting aside the roughly 4.48 billion votes controlled by Zuckerberg and other insiders as of April that presumably would have been voted against the proposal, Harris said, about 83 percent of shares voted by outsiders supported the proposal - a higher level of support than shareholder measures usually receive.  Using a similar method, Harris also calculated Zuckerberg received support from only about 65 percent of investors, much lower than the usual 90-percent-plus support directors typically receive at big U.S. companies. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg received a similarly low level of support from outsiders.  A similar shareholder proposal at last year\u2019s Facebook annual meeting received a comparable level of support, and opposition to Zuckerberg and Sandberg was also comparable.

Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement he was \u201cdeeply frustrated that it took a group of domestic terrorists storming the Capitol\u201d for Facebook to take action and wondered \u201cif the decision was an opportunistic one, motivated by the news of a Democratically controlled Congress.\u201d  Democratic Senator Mark Warner, incoming chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said the social media actions did not go far enough.  \u201cThese platforms have served as core organizing infrastructure for violent, far right groups and militia movements for several years now \u2013 helping them to recruit, organize, coordinate and in many cases (particularly with respect to YouTube) generate profits from their violent, extremist content,\u201d he said in a statement.  YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, said Thursday any channel that posts videos with false claims about the election results will be temporarily restricted from uploading or live streaming.  YouTube did not respond to a question about whether it would ban Trump\u2019s account in the same manner as Facebook, while a Twitter spokesman said it was continuing to \u201cevaluate the situation in real time, including examining activity on the ground and statements made off Twitter.\u201d He said Twitter would inform the public if an \u201cescalation\u201d in its approach was necessary.","69":"WASHINGTON, July 17 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc\u2019s planned cryptocurrency Libra could help boost financial inclusion, but also raises concerns about consumer protection, data privacy, and potential \u201cbackdoor dollarization,\u201d the IMF\u2019s chief economist said on Wednesday.

A few days before the election, Facebook removed dozens of pages and accounts associated with a Brazilian marketing group, for violating the social media network\u2019s misrepresentation and spam policies.  WhatsApp has more than 120 million users in Brazil, a country of nearly 210 million people, rivaling the reach of Facebook\u2019s main platform in one of the company\u2019s biggest global markets.

The smartphone and connected device maker is looking to rev up excitement levels with its fans - and potential investors - ahead of the Hong Kong listing that could come as soon as June, as it looks to justify a sky-high expected valuation.  Xiaomi is expected to command a market value of $70 billion to $100 billion, just eight years after its founding. Raising $10 billion would also make it the largest global listing in almost four years after Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  In an event in Shenzhen in front of a packed-out stadium with thousands of Xiaomi super-fans, the firm\u2019s chief executive Lei Jun presented the flagship Mi 8, an anniversary smartphone strikingly similar to Apple Inc\u2019s iPhone X.  Xiaomi\u2019s blockbuster initial public offering (IPO) has drawn major scrutiny on the company\u2019s performance, even following a recent return to form and after it blew past its 100 billion yuan sales target for 2017 with a couple of months to spare.  There are concerns over thin margins, a stalling Chinese smartphone market, costs of opening physical stores rather than sticking with online sales, and obstacles facing the brand to retain its followers and win new ones overseas, analysts said.  At the Shenzhen event, chapters of Xiaomi fans carrying colourful banners cheered Lei onto the stage, the device maker\u2019s charismatic founder who has developed a cult status with the so-called \u201cmi fans\u201d akin to the late Apple founder Steve Jobs.  Slideshow ( 14 images )  The firm also presented a Xiaomi headset developed with Facebook\u2019s virtual reality unit Oculus, which is now led by former Xiaomi executive Hugo Barra, who attended the event. Facebook\u2019s main social media platform is blocked in China.  Xiaomi, which started with smartphones but has since branched out into a plethora of smart devices, gained a following in China by releasing limited batches of slick-looking phones online at a mid-range price tag.  It has a hard core of followers in China who snap up its gadgets ranging from scooters and air purifiers to rice cookers and event underpants.  Amid the bright lights and a pumping soundtrack at the Shenzhen show, one attendee said he had been won over - though Xiaomi will need to attract many more to sustain its IPO push.  Liao Ruihang who works in e-commerce said he had traveled from neighboring Guangzhou for the event and was attracted to the brand by the wide array of apps that could be used on Xiaomi\u2019s open-source operating system.  \u201cI\u2019ve been using an iPhone but will now buy a Mi 8,\u201d he said, flanked by other fans wearing t-shirts blazoned with slogans such as, \u201cI love Mi\u201d.","72":"SYDNEY, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said he would continue his talks with Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg on Friday after the social media platform blocked its news feeds in the country over disputes over a new media payment code.  \u201cWe spoke yesterday morning but then we were subsequently in contact and we agreed to talk later this morning, we\u2019ll see where those discussions go and we can find a pathway going forward,\u201d Frydenberg told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.  Facebook took down pages of domestic and international news outlets on Thursday but also blocked several Australian state governments and emergency departments saying the draft media payment law did not clearly define news drawing widespread criticism.

The social networking giant has linked with 28 partners including Mastercard, PayPal and Uber to form Libra Association, a Geneva-based entity governing the new digital coin, according to marketing materials and interviews with executives. No banks are yet part of the group.  To facilitate transactions, Facebook also created Calibra, a subsidiary that will offer digital wallets to save, send and spend Libras. Calibra will be connected to Facebook messaging platforms Messenger and WhatsApp.  The whole system is scheduled to launch in the first half of 2020.  Facebook executives and others associated with Libra have big aspirations. They hope it will not only power transactions between established consumers and businesses globally, but offer unbanked consumers access to financial services for the first time.  Facebook is also betting Libra can squeeze more revenue out of its suite of apps, something already happening on Chinese social networks like WeChat.  Representative Maxine Waters, chairwoman of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, called for Facebook executives to testify before Congress and asked the company to halt development of Libra until lawmakers and regulators have reviewed the project.  \u201cWith the announcement that it plans to create a cryptocurrency, Facebook is continuing its unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users,\u201d Waters said in a statement.  Other regulators, lawmakers and government officials around the globe also quickly issued critical statements. France\u2019s finance minister said he had asked central bank heads from G7 countries to write a report on the project by mid-July.  A Facebook representative said the company looked forward to answering lawmakers\u2019 questions.  Before Tuesday\u2019s announcement, Facebook was already facing significant backlash over mishandling user data and not doing enough to prevent Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Those issues have led some government officials to call for Facebook to incur penalties, or be forcibly broken up.  Kevin Weil, who runs product for the Libra initiative, said Facebook hopes it can bring global regulators to the table by publicizing its plan.  \u201cIt gives us a basis to go and have productive conversations with regulators around the world,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cWe\u2019re eager to do that.\u201d  The name \u201cLibra\u201d comes from Roman weight measurements, the astrological sign for justice and the French word for freedom, said David Marcus, who heads the project for Facebook.  \u201cFreedom, justice and money, which is exactly what we\u2019re trying to do here,\u201d Marcus said in an interview.  Facebook shares closed up 0.1%.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  UNREGULATED SECTOR  Facebook is using one of the least-regulated areas of finance for its foray into the sector.  Bitcoin, the best-known digital coin, was created in 2008 as an alternative to traditional currencies that are controlled by governments and central banks. Some countries have explored ways to regulate the market since then, but crypto trading remains largely unsupervised.  In the meantime, investors have lost hundreds of millions of dollars through steep price drops and crypto-exchange hacks. The market has also faced money-laundering and terrorist-financing allegations.  But Facebook\u2019s status as a Silicon Valley behemoth touching billions of people around the world could help legitimize what has so far been a niche and volatile market.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Other Libra Association members include companies like Visa, Spotify, eBay and Vodafone, as well as venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz.  They hope to have 100 members by Libra\u2019s launch. Each gets one vote on substantial decisions and firms must invest at least $10 million to join.  The group aims to raise money through a private placement in coming months. Facebook does not plan to maintain a leadership role after 2019.  Though there are no major banks among the inaugural members, there have been discussions with them, said Jorn Lambert, executive vice president for digital solutions at Mastercard.  Big lenders are waiting to see how regulators and consumers respond to the project before deciding whether to join, he said.  Some Libra backers acknowledged that consumer privacy brawls or regulatory resistance could hinder their lofty goals, and detailed some steps they are taking to pre-empt those issues.  For instance, Calibra plans to conduct compliance checks on customers who want to sign up, using verification and anti-fraud processes that are common among banks.  The subsidiary will only share customer data with Facebook or external parties if it has consent, or in \u201climited cases\u201d where it is necessary, Facebook said. That could include for law enforcement, public safety or general system functionality.  Sri Shivananda, PayPal\u2019s chief technology officer, said the project was still in its \u201cvery, very early days\u201d in terms of getting necessary regulatory approvals and consumer buy-in.  And, Mastercard\u2019s Lambert said that if the project receives too much pushback, \u201cwe might not launch.\u201d  (For a graphic on 'Bitcoin futures' click tmsnrt.rs\/2Wt4AwE)","74":"April 13 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s compensation for 2017 rose 53.5 percent to $8.9 million, a regulatory filing showed on Friday.

REUTERS\/Thomas White - RC13B0FC4740  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Facebook is heading into an earnings pincer movement. Sales growth at the $410 billion social-media network slowed in the third quarter, the company said on Tuesday. Combating that and other problems means spending more, hitting both top and bottom lines. That may force Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to take rash countermeasures.  Executives warned in July that the pace of spending from advertisers, which makes up nearly all its revenue, would decelerate during the second half of the year. Its stock has plummeted nearly 35 percent since then, making it the worst performer of its major U.S. tech peers Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet.  So it should be no surprise that revenue increased 33 percent last quarter, compared with 47 percent in the same period last year.  Shareholders may be stuck with the more pedestrian rate of growth. Facebook\u2019s recklessness with customer data coupled with Kremlin-backed meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections are two massive challenges. Many people also partly blame Facebook for the highly charged political climate and unsettling divisiveness coursing through America and beyond.  Zuckerberg has pledged to spend to clean up the toxic newsfeed while fighting regulators eager to rein in Facebook\u2019s use of members\u2019 information. The likely result is a fall in users, as Twitter is experiencing as it kicks off bots and other accounts. The number of daily active users was flat in North America and fell in Europe compared to the prior quarter. Fewer people using the network reduces Facebook\u2019s pricing power with advertisers. That\u2019s already flowing through to the operating margin which declined to 42 percent from 50 percent in the third quarter last year.  Assume it gets ugly for Facebook, with the margin slumping to just 20 percent by 2020. Meanwhile revenue growth decelerates to 10 percent from a projected 36 percent for 2018. That would shrink Facebook\u2019s market value to some $160 billion, based on the current multiple of 15 times 2020 earnings estimates.  A company\u2019s results don\u2019t have to get that bad for executives to start looking for an escape plan. Often, that includes going shopping. Zuckerberg\u2019s eye for a deal has so far been fairly sharp; snapping up Instagram for $1 billion was a shrewd move. But desperation can blur vision and lead to ill-advised M&A. That can end up as friendly fire.","77":"Reuters Fact Check.

U.S. Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who also sits on Senate Banking Committee, expressed concern that through Libra, Facebook was using its scale in social networking to achieve dominance in adjacent markets like mobile payments.  French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire called for more regulation of tech companies.  \u201cThis instrument for transactions will allow Facebook to collect millions and millions of data, which strengthens my conviction that there is a need to regulate the digital giants,\u201d he said in an interview on Europe 1 radio.

REUTERS\/Yuri Gripas  The agreement came after a G7 working group warned that when launched on a wide scale, stablecoins - digital currencies usually backed by traditional money and other assets - could threaten the world\u2019s monetary system and financial stability.  Finance chiefs of the G20 major economies agreed that while stablecoins could have potential benefits of financial innovation, they give rise to a set of \u201cserious\u201d public policy and regulatory risks.  \u201cSuch risks, including in particular those related to money laundering, illicit finance, and consumer and investor protection, need to be evaluated and appropriately addressed before these projects can commence operation,\u201d the G20 finance leaders said in a statement issued after their meeting.  Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the G20 will kick off debate on how to regulate stablecoins based on proposals it receives from standard-setting bodies like the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  The FSB and the FATF are expected to report their findings on stablecoins to the G20 next year. That reduces the chance Facebook will meet its goal of rolling out Libra in 2020.  \u201cPolicymakers have expressed concerns over various risks stablecoins pose.

That was something agreed by the G20 members,\u201d Kuroda told a news conference hosted by Japan, which chaired this year\u2019s G20 gatherings.  BROADER MONETARY IMPLICATIONS  The G20 has also asked the International Monetary Fund to examine the economic implications, including monetary sovereignty issues, according to the group\u2019s press release.  \u201cSome emerging countries have concerns on what could happen if stablecoins backed by a huge customer base become widely used globally,\u201d said Kuroda, who was among the global finance leaders gathered in Washington this week for the IMF and World Bank fall meetings.  \u201cBut this is not just a problem for emerging economies. It could have a broader impact on monetary policy and financial system stability,\u201d he said.  The G20 agreement underscored concerns among global policymakers about stablecoins such as Libra, which suffered a defection of a quarter of its original members that had initially backed the project.  German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz on Friday redoubled his criticism of Libra, saying creation of a new world currency should be prevented.  \u201cWe now know that both the G7 and G20 are quite cautious about stablecoins,\u201d a Japanese Ministry of Finance official who attended the G20 talks told reporters.  \u201cPersonally, I feel that such strong concerns held by policymakers may have been among reasons why some companies decided to pull out of the Libra project,\u201d the official said.  While setting regulations on stablecoins, policymakers will also debate ways to make existing cross-border settlement and payment systems more efficient, BOJ\u2019s Kuroda said.  But such efforts will be confined to private-sector settlements, he said, adding that the G20 did not discuss the idea of central banks issuing digital currencies.  \u201cThe BOJ, too, has no plans for now to issue digital currencies,\u201d Kuroda said.","81":"(Raw quotes from officials, media publishers, NGOs and the public in a breaking news situation)  SYDNEY, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Australians woke to empty news feeds on their Facebook Inc pages on Thursday after the social media giant blocked all media content in a surprise and dramatic escalation of a dispute with the government over paying for content.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The Justice Department said that Facebook had \u201crefused\u201d to recruit, consider or hire qualified U.S. workers for more than 2,600 jobs that in many cases paid an average salary of $156,000 a year.  Instead, it opted to fill the positions using temporary visa holders, such as those with H-1B visas, the department added.  \u201cFacebook intentionally created a hiring system in which it denied qualified U.S. workers a fair opportunity to learn about and apply for jobs,\u201d the Justice Department said. The social media company instead sought to channel such jobs to temporary visa holders it wanted to sponsor for green cards or permanent residency, it added.  Company spokesman Daniel Roberts said: \u201cFacebook has been cooperating with the DOJ in its review of this issue and while we dispute the allegations in the complaint, we cannot comment further on pending litigation.\u201d  H-1B visas are often used by the technology sector to bring highly skilled foreign guest workers to the United States. But critics say the laws governing these visas are lax, and make it too easy to replace U.S. workers with cheaper, foreign labor.  The Facebook lawsuit is the latest example of the Trump administration clashing with Silicon Valley over attempts to restrict immigration for foreign workers. Trump and Republican lawmakers have also clashed with the company in other areas, such as accusing the platform of stifling conservative voices.  The Justice and Labor departments have both investigated big tech companies in the past over allegations similar to those against Facebook, but they have rarely brought charges due to loopholes in the law.  Tech companies and industry groups have pushed back against moves to limit immigration of foreign workers by saying there are not enough American students graduating with science and engineering degrees to meet the demand for filling jobs in areas such as artificial intelligence.  In June, Trump issued a presidential proclamation that temporarily blocked foreign workers entering on H-1B visas - an attempt the administration then said would open up 525,000 jobs for U.S. workers.

Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat and vice chair of the Intelligence Committee, helped organize a dinner for Zuckerberg with other senators at the company\u2019s request, Warner spokeswoman Rachel Cohen said.  At an unnamed restaurant, the senators and Zuckerberg discussed \u201cthe role and responsibility of social media platforms in protecting our democracy, and what steps Congress should take to defend our elections, protect consumer data, and encourage competition in the social media space,\u201d she said.  It is Zuckerberg\u2019s first trip to Washington since April 2018, when he fielded 10 hours of questions over two days from nearly 100 U.S. lawmakers over privacy issues, election security and potential regulation.  Zuckerberg is set to be on Capitol Hill Thursday to hold additional meetings, including with Utah Senator Mike Lee, a Republican.  Zuckerberg will be in Washington to \u201ctalk about future internet regulation\u201d with policymakers but has no public events planned, Facebook said in a statement Wednesday.  A person briefed on the matter said he was also expected to hold meetings with the Trump administration. A White House spokesman declined to comment.  Facebook, which agreed to a record-setting $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over privacy practices in July, also faces antitrust investigations by the FTC and a group of state attorneys general.  The FTC privacy probe was triggered last year by allegations that Facebook violated a 2012 consent decree by inappropriately sharing information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. The consultancy\u2019s clients included Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign.  The world\u2019s largest social media network has also drawn ire from Capitol Hill after it announced plans in June to launch the Libra crypto currency as it expands into e-commerce. The project, comprised of a consortium of financial firms based in Switzerland, is scheduled to launch in 2020.  Regulators, central banks and politicians in the United States and Europe worry that Libra has the potential to upend the world financial system, harm privacy and foster money laundering.  Facebook faces scrutiny from lawmakers on a wide range of issues, including privacy, market power, efforts to combat extremism online, preventing foreign interference in campaigns, and accusations of political bias.  The company is also being probed by a group of state attorneys general led by New York.  Once lauded as engines of economic growth, the companies in social media, internet search, e-commerce and other digital technologies have increasingly been on the defensive over lapses such as privacy breaches and their outsized market influence.  Facebook, which owns one-time rivals Instagram and WhatsApp, has more than 1.5 billion daily users.","87":"(Reuters) - Viewers may finally be able to vote the next Puck, the notoriously obnoxious housemate of \u201cMTV\u2019s The Real World,\u201d off the show.

Australia will become the first country to require Facebook and Google to pay for news content provided by media companies under a royalty-style system that will become law this year, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said.  \u201cIt\u2019s about a fair go for Australian news media businesses. It\u2019s about ensuring that we have increased competition, increased consumer protection, and a sustainable media landscape,\u201d Frydenberg told reporters in Melbourne.  \u201cNothing less than the future of the Australian media landscape is at stake.\u201d  The move comes as the tech giants fend off calls around the world for greater regulation, and a day after Google and Facebook took a battering for alleged abuse of market power from U.S. lawmakers in a congressional hearing.  Following an inquiry into the state of the media market and the power of the U.S. platforms, the Australian government late last year told Facebook and Google to negotiate a voluntary deal with media companies to use their content.  Those talks went nowhere and Canberra now says if an agreement cannot reached through arbitration within 45 days the Australian Communications and Media Authority would set legally binding terms on behalf of the government.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Google said the regulation ignores \u201cbillions of clicks\u201d that it sends to Australian news publishers each year.  \u201cIt sends a concerning message to businesses and investors that the Australian government will intervene instead of letting the market work,\u201d Mel Silva, managing director of Google Australia and New Zealand, said in a statement.  \u201cIt does nothing to solve the fundamental challenges of creating a business model fit for the digital age.\u201d  Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  \u201cUNFAIR AND DAMAGING\u201d  Media companies including News Corp Australia, a unit of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp NWSA.O, lobbied hard for the government to force the U.S. companies to the negotiating table amid a long decline in advertising revenue.

A 2019 study estimated about 3,000 journalism jobs have been lost in Australia in the past 10 years, as traditional media companies bled advertising revenue to Google and Facebook which paid nothing for news content.  For every A$100 spent on online advertising in Australia, excluding classifieds, nearly a third goes to Google and Facebook, according to Frydenberg.  Other countries have tried and failed to force the hands of the tech giants.  Publishers in Germany, France and Spain have pushed to pass national copyright laws that force Google pay licensing fees when it publishes snippets of their news articles.  In 2019, Google stopped showing news snippets from European publishers on search results for its French users, while Germany\u2019s biggest news publisher, Axel Springer, allowed the search engine to run snippets of its articles after traffic to its sites to plunged.","89":"March 23 (Reuters) - Rocket company SpaceX\u2019s verified Facebook page disappeared on Friday, minutes after its founder and Silicon Valley billionaire Elon Musk promised on Twitter to take down the page when challenged by a user.  \"Delete SpaceX page on Facebook if you're the man?\" a user tweeted to Tesla Inc chief Musk.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  The report by former Senator Jon Kyl, commissioned by Facebook and released on Tuesday, found in interviews with about 133 political conservatives that many opposed Facebook policies they believed undermined free speech by conservatives, such as bans on \u201chate speech.\u201d  It is the latest effort by Facebook to address rising anger among Republicans over alleged conservative bias as some lawmakers call for legislation that would revoke the liability shield big tech companies have for content posted by users.  They also pointed to anecdotal examples of what they call unfair treatment of conservative viewpoints, such as unjustified removal of language from the Bible, which they suggest are examples of broader problems with enforcement of policies.  Facebook said in response it has hired staff dedicated to \u201cworking with right-of-center organizations and leaders.\u201d  U.S. President Donald Trump and many Republicans in Congress accuse various social media firms of anti-conservative bias, while tech companies and Democrats have rejected the charge.  U.S. Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat who chairs a House panel on antitrust issues, questioned the review, noting the \u201c\u2018audit\u2019 was conducted by a conservative former Republican Senator who now works as a federal lobbyist.\u201d  Republican Senator Josh Hawley said the report was not a real audit but a \u201csmokescreen disguised as a solution. Facebook should conduct an actual audit by giving a trusted third party access to its algorithm, its key documents, and its content moderation protocols.\u201d  Facebook and other large tech firms have acknowledged mistakes in handling some specific content issues.  Facebook spokesman Nick Clegg said in a blog post on Tuesday that the company needs \u201cto take these concerns seriously and adjust course if our policies are in fact limiting expression in an unintended way.\u201d  The Kyl report noted Facebook has made changes including more transparent decisions on why people see specific posts, ensuring page managers can see enforcement actions, launching an appeals process and creating a new content oversight board made up of people with diverse ideological views.  Republican senators have held hearings over the last two years with Facebook, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google accusing them of bias. Last month, two Republican senators asked the Federal Trade Commission to probe how major tech companies curate content.  Democrats say the bias allegations are without merit. Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono said in April that \u201cwe cannot allow the Republican party to harass tech companies into weakening content moderation policies that already fail to remove hateful, dangerous and misleading content.\u201d  The report noted Facebook\u2019s advertising policies prohibit \u201cshocking and sensational content\u201d and the company has historically rejected images of \u201cmedical tubes connected to the human body.\u201d  This resulted in some anti-abortion advertisements being rejected. Facebook has revised its policies to prohibit only ads depicting \u201csomeone in visible pain or distress or where blood and bruising is visible. This change expands the scope of advocacy available for groups seeking to use previously prohibited images.\u201d  The report by Kyl - who represented Arizona in the Senate from 1995 to 2013 and again in 2018 - focused on six areas of concern. These included how Facebook chooses content for readers, content rules such as those banning hate speech, potential political bias in content enforcement, ad policies such as the prohibition of \u201cshocking or sensational content,\u201d enforcement of ad policies, and a belief that Facebook\u2019s workforce lacks political diversity.","94":"* Facebook shares on track for worst day since September 2012  * Indexes down: Dow 1.23 pct, S&P 1.44 pct, Nasdaq 2.09 pct  * Tech stocks drop 2.6 pct, with FAANG stock leading losses  * Industrials dip as G-20 meet looms, with tariffs in focus  * Investors also cautious ahead of Fed meet starting Tuesday (Updates to early afternoon)  By Sruthi Shankar  March 19 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks sank about 2 percent on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average shedding nearly 400 points, as Facebook led a selloff in technology stocks on reports that the social media company\u2019s user information was misused.  Facebook shares tumbled 7.1 percent on reports that a political consultancy that worked on President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign gained inappropriate access to data on more than 50 million users, sparking broader concerns about data privacy and security.

REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  (Reuters) - Regulation intended to address the news industry\u2019s problems with Google and Facebook could have adverse consequences, said outgoing New York Times Co NYT.N Chief Executive Officer Mark Thompson in an interview this week.  The news industry has seen its business model upended by tech giants like Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google GOOGL.O and Facebook Inc FB.O, which have siphoned online advertising dollars from publishers and which distribute news articles without paying the outlets that produce them.  Thompson, who has helped lead the Times\u2019 transformation to a \u201csubscription-first business model\u201d said this week that if a news organization is too dependent on digital advertising, it is a \u201cstraightforward competitor\u201d with the major platforms that are also selling advertising - a war most news organizations that don\u2019t have distinctive brands and content will find hard to win because the platforms are so much bigger.  Outside the United States, some regulators are making the tech giants pay for news: France\u2019s competition authority has ordered Google to pay French publishers for their content, while Australian regulators are forcing the company and Facebook to share advertising revenue with local media groups.  But while Thompson believes regulatory scrutiny of the platforms is reasonable, he sees risk in giving regulators and politicians more control of media.  \u201cMy own view is, the more we can get the major platforms to work bilaterally and voluntarily to help support journalism at every level, the better it will be,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cThe more it becomes part of a long extended, regulatory, and political process, the less likely it is to help in time, and the more likely you are to get different kinds of adverse consequences.\u201d  Facebook pays The Times and other publishers to feature their content on the Facebook News section of the social media company\u2019s app.  In June the Times ended its partnership with Apple Inc\u2019s AAPL.O news aggregator Apple News, saying that publishers should be fairly compensated for their content.  Thompson is stepping down in September, when Chief Operating Officer Meredith Kopit Levien becomes the company\u2019s new CEO.","104":"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Facebook faced backlash from publishers and politicians on Thursday after blocking news feeds in Australia in a surprise escalation of a dispute with the government over a law to require it to share revenue from news.  Facebook wiped out pages from Australian state governments and charities as well as from domestic and international news organisations, three days before the launch of a nationwide COVID-19 vaccination programme.  Though the measure was limited to Australia, European publishers along with British and Canadian politicians described it as an attempt to put pressure on governments that might consider similar measures.  \u201cFacebook\u2019s actions to unfriend Australia today, cutting off essential information services on health and emergency services, were as arrogant as they were disappointing,\u201d Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison wrote on his own Facebook page.  \u201cThese actions will only confirm the concerns that an increasing number of countries are expressing about the behaviour of Big Tech companies who think they are bigger than governments and that the rules should not apply to them.\u201d  Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault, who is drafting legislation to make the platforms pay for using media content, said Facebook\u2019s move was \u201chighly irresponsible.\u201d  \u201cIt won\u2019t deter us from moving ahead,\u201d he said in remarks to reporters.  The dispute centres on a planned Australian law that would require Facebook and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google to reach deals to pay news outlets whose links drive traffic to their platforms, or agree on a price through arbitration.  A Facebook spokeswoman said that CEO Mark Zuckerberg had \u201ca constructive call with Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and again expressed our disappointment with the proposed law.\u201d She said Facebook would continue to engage with the governments on amendments to the law.  Facebook said it had blocked a wide swathe of pages because the draft law did not clearly define news content. It said its commitment to combat misinformation had not changed, and it would restore pages that were taken down by mistake.  \u201cAs the law does not provide clear guidance on the definition of news content, we have taken a broad definition in order to respect the law as drafted,\u201d a company spokesman said.  Facebook used its machine learning tools to identify news on the site to enforce the Australia action that blocked everything from news and government websites to its own site in Australia at one point.  Benedict Evans, a digital media analyst and former partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, said the argument that Facebook would willingly pay for news article links on its platform if not for its dominance is misguided, and no other website pays publishers to link stories.  \u201cThere is willful blindness to this logic,\u201d Evans wrote in a blog post on Wednesday. No-one has ever paid to link, regardless of their market power.\u201d  The head of the British parliamentary committee overseeing the media industry, Julian Knight, said the message was aimed far beyond Australia.  \u201cThis action - this bully boy action - that they\u2019ve undertaken in Australia will I think ignite a desire to go further amongst legislators around the world,\u201d Knight told Reuters.  \u201cI think they\u2019re almost using Australia as a test of strength for global democracies as to whether or not they wish to impose restrictions on the way in which they do business,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, we\u2019re all behind Australia in my view.\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  News publishers saw Facebook\u2019s tactics as evidence that the company, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, cannot be trusted as the gatekeeper for their industry.  Henry Faure Walker, chairman of Britain\u2019s News Media Association industry group, said banning news during a global pandemic was \u201ca classic example of a monopoly power being the schoolyard bully, trying to protect its dominant position with scant regard for the citizens and customers it supposedly serves.\u201d  The head of Germany\u2019s BDZV news publishers\u2019 association, Dietmar Wolff, said: \u201cIt is high time that governments all over the world limit the market power of the gatekeeper platforms.\u201d  Facebook shares traded down 2% on Thursday.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  DIFFERENT STRATEGIES  Publishers say platforms such as Google and Facebook hoard the bulk of revenue as media shifts online as print and broadcast advertising shrivels, forcing newspapers and TV and radio stations to scale down newsrooms or shut.  Google has complained that Australia\u2019s rules go further than new revenue-sharing laws in parts of Europe, because they would apply even to links and snippets of articles, which it says limits internet users\u2019 free speech.  Still, Facebook\u2019s action in Australia represented a tactical split with Google. They had campaigned together against such laws and both threatened to cancel services in Australia, but Google sealed pre-emptive deals with several media outlets in recent days.  Google declined comment on Facebook\u2019s action.  Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp was the latest to announce a deal in which it will receive \u201csignificant payments\u201d from Google to provide content for the search engine\u2019s News Showcase account.  Facebook drew particular condemnation for including in its blackout charity accounts and major state governments, including those providing advice on the COVID-19 pandemic and bushfire threats. Some were later restored.  Facebook said the planned Australian law, expected to be passed by parliament within days, \u201cfundamentally misunderstands\u201d the relationship between itself and publishers and it faced a stark choice of complying or banning news.  The tech giant has said news makes up just 4% of what people view on its website. But for Australians, Facebook\u2019s role in news delivery is growing. A 2020 University of Canberra study found 21% of Australians use social media as their primary news source and 39% of the population uses Facebook to receive news.  With professional journalism blacked out, \u201cFacebook has exponentially increased the opportunity for misinformation, dangerous radicalism and conspiracy theories to abound on its platform,\u201d tweeted Lisa Davies, editor of The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper.","105":"DUBLIN, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Ireland\u2019s High Court on Monday temporarily froze a probe by Facebook\u2019s lead European Union regulator into the legality of the U.S. social media giant\u2019s transatlantic data flows, a court spokesman said.

Shares of Beyond Meat jumped 23% to just over $123 on Wednesday after the plant-based meat maker reported a surprise profit for the first quarter. The $7.6 billion company on Tuesday said first-quarter net income was $1.8 million, compared with estimates of a $4.7 million loss, according to Refinitiv data. The company is taking advantage of meat shortages caused by Covid-19 outbreaks in U.S. slaughterhouses, and it plans to increase discounts to make its prices more competitive to the supply-tight animal proteins like ground beef.  That all bodes well for the hyped-up fake-meat market. The problem is that the boost has a shelf life. It, like other food suppliers, is also losing business while people eat out less. Pork plants won\u2019t be struggling forever, and Beyond Meat still has plenty of competitors at its heels. Without a wholescale shift to fake meat, investors will get burned.

Facebook on Wednesday named members of a new oversight board that will hear user appeals about content decisions made by the social network and its photo-sharing unit Instagram. The committee is meant to appease critics of the power that Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s $590 billion company wields. The diverse, independent body includes ex-politicians, human rights activists and journalists.  But it is dicey for Facebook. The body is funded by a $130 million trust established by the firm, raising questions about its autonomy. Liberals and conservatives alike have accused the company of favoring the other\u2019s interests. The board\u2019s binding decisions could also spark accusations of bias.  Ex-U.S. federal judge Michael McConnell, one of the co-chairs, asked for patience as the group learns by trial and error.

Natixis managed to sweeten otherwise dire first-quarter results on Wednesday. The Paris-based investment bank announced it had slipped to a net loss of 82 million euros in the three months to March, due to trading flubs and increased bad debt charges. However, Natixis added that moves by regulators to help lenders cope with the pandemic have lowered its minimum capital requirement by a meaty 1.2 percentage points. That allowed Chief Executive Francois Riahi to cut his target common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to just 10.2%, from 11.2% currently. The implication is that Natixis could hand back some or all of 1.2 billion euros in excess capital to shareholders, equivalent to nearly a fifth of its market capitalisation, once payouts are switched back on. That would cheer up investors who have watched Natixis shares roughly halve in value this year. First, however, the bank needs to avoid further losses. (By Christopher Thompson)  NO HOT AIR.

Chief Executive Brian Chesky was sensitive in his letter to employees, which will be followed by one-on-one talks with managers.

Easterbrook was ousted in November for having a consensual relationship with another McDonald\u2019s employee.  Executive pay has long been a point of contention, but against the backdrop of a pandemic, Easterbrook\u2019s severance highlights a stark and troubling contrast.

Given Covid-19 has left most of the globe sitting on its backside eating sweets, investors can expect another boost later this year.

The private lender\u2019s president told Bloomberg that it\u2019s on track to issue 2 trillion yuan ($280 billion) in loans this year, up 18% from 2019. That will please Beijing, which wants the financial system to lend more to the private sector as it struggles to shake off Covid-19. Showing that catering to SMEs can be profitable might inspire more conservative loan officers.  A lending spree now will test MYbank\u2019s claim that its algorithms can find quality borrowers among smaller, difficult-to-audit private companies.

Their remarks countered Wall Street expectations of a devastation of the digital ads market as hard-hit brands in travel and autos, traditionally big ad spenders, have pulled marketing dollars and as small businesses, the lifeblood of big tech companies\u2019 businesses, have shut down.  At Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet Inc, first-quarter total revenue grew 13% from the previous year to $41.2 billion, while Facebook Inc\u2019s ad sales rose 17% to $17.44 billion.  They issued first-quarter results that only factored in two weeks of the widespread stay-at-home orders in the United States, but both companies also reassured investors that revenue for the first three weeks of April showed signs of stability following lower revenue in March.  Alphabet, Facebook and Snap Inc credited direct response ads, or ads that solicit a direct action, such as clicking a link, using a coupon code or downloading mobile games, with propping up sales during the pandemic.  These types of ads help advertisers get the most out of their money by encouraging immediate response from audiences and are easier to measure, since brands can see how many people clicked on a link or took an action after seeing the ad.  Brand advertising that is used to spread awareness and name recognition for a company, but whose effectiveness is often more difficult to measure, was harder hit. Alphabet said on Tuesday brand advertising declined on YouTube in mid-March, when the pandemic accelerated in the United States.  Facebook executives said on Wednesday they expected direct response advertising to continue to drive ad sales and that the coronavirus pandemic only reinforced the importance of the strategy.  Still, Facebook was cautious given economists are forecasting a global downturn in the second quarter and \u201cif history were a guide, would suggest the potential for an even more severe advertising industry contraction,\u201d said David Wehner, Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, during an earnings call.  Alphabet warned that the second quarter could be difficult because the early April trends may not hold.  Snap Inc, which owns messaging app Snapchat, said it would shift resources on its ad sales team to better serve direct response advertisers, due to the success of the category.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg was grilled for two days by U.S. lawmakers over the leak, yet he and his management team weren\u2019t even asked by analysts about a possible clampdown by regulators after Facebook reported a 49-percent jump in first-quarter revenues.  \u201cI don\u2019t know that we really see a Doomsday scenario here,\u201d Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said when asked about the worst possible outcome of the new privacy regime. There could be minor limitations to data usage that might have an impact on targeting for Facebook\u2019s advertisers, Wehner added.  Facebook, like other consumer tech companies, has overhauled its terms of service to bring them into line with the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The rules require requests to gather data to be made in easily understood language, and give users greater rights over that information.  Crucially, the social network has said it won\u2019t let users opt out of targeted ads that account for most of its revenues. They will be able to limit the amount of data gathered, however, creating the potential for marginal attrition of revenues.  \u201cThe biggest risk facing Facebook is that changes from GDPR-type regulations will limit the targeting capabilities of advertisers and thus the willingness to keep spending,\u201d said analyst Michael Nathanson of Moffett Nathanson Research.  There was no evidence that Facebook would be affected more than its digital competitors, he added in a research note: \u201cIt is probable that Facebook emerges comparatively stronger in this new world.\u201d  Investors seemed to agree, sending Facebook shares 9 percent higher as the stock market opened on Thursday.  DOING ENOUGH?  Analysts - both bullish and bearish - reckon Facebook is doing enough to avoid the wrath of European regulators who, when GDPR takes effect on May 25, will gain the power to fine it up to 4 percent of annual revenues for serious privacy violations.  \u201cWe think Facebook are being sincere with GDPR,\u201d said Christopher Rossbach, chief investment officer at J. Stern & Co, who continues to rate Facebook as one of the best investments in the market today.  Facebook had made significant investments into security, safety and privacy on its platform that would, over time, increase the confidence of users and make it more enjoyable to use, he said.  Independent analyst Richard Windsor, despite being bearish, also doubts Facebook has much to fear from the GDPR regulator - Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) will be responsible for overseeing Facebook because its main EU office is in Dublin.  The Irish DPC\u2019s annual budget for this year, of 11.7 million euros ($14.2 million), pales in comparison with Facebook\u2019s earnings of $4.99 billion in the first quarter.  Windsor, who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog, expected concerns arising from the Cambridge Analytica case to be resolved without direct intervention.  \u201cWhat Facebook may end up proposing is for users to pay for (using) it - with their personal data or in cash,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cWhen this is cleared up the problem goes away.\u201d  ($1 = 0.8236 euros)","113":"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe\u2019s antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, has warned Apple Inc to give equal treatment to all apps on its platform amid the iPhone maker\u2019s privacy changes that have drawn charges of anti-competitive practices from rival Facebook Inc.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Apple will in the spring ask iPhone users for consent to track their data for personalized ads in what it says is a move to protect users\u2019 privacy but which will limit apps\u2019 ability to gather data from people\u2019s phones that can be used for targeted advertising.  Facebook has been among the most vocal of the critics which stand to lose a substantial part of their revenue from Apple\u2019s move.  Facebook in a December blog post called it anti-competitive behaviour, saying that Apple\u2019s own personalized ad platform would be exempt from the new requirement giving users a choice of whether to opt in to tracking by third parties.  Vestager said while the issue is privacy-related, it can morph into an antitrust issue if Apple tilts the level playing field.  \u201cIt can be competition if it is shown that Apple is not treating its own apps in the same way,\u201d she told Reuters in an interview on Monday.  Vestager said so far she has not received any complaint about Apple\u2019s changes.  She said the privacy move is also similar to her proposal unveiled last year to curb the powers of U.S. tech giants and allow consumers to have more control of their personal data.  \u201cIt is a very good thing to have a clear opt-out option. If you look at the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act, these are some of the solutions we are looking at there.\u201d  Apple was not immediately available for comment. The company has said the opt-out option would apply to all developers who track users - including Apple itself - but because its advertising platform does not track users, the option is a moot point.  Apple is currently the target of two EU investigations, one into its mobile payment system, Apple Pay, and the other into its App Store.","114":"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Adyen, ADYEN_w.AS, which processes payments for Netflix NFLX.O, Facebook FB.O and eBay EBAY.O, saw its value double to $17 billion in a market debut on Wednesday reminiscent of the 1999 tech bubble.  After a highly sought initial public offering, shares in the Dutch company had been priced on Tuesday at 240 euros, the top of their indicated range, suggesting a market capitalization of 7.1 billion euros ($8.5 billion). After the first hour of trade on the Euronext exchange on Wednesday the share price hit 480.00 euros.  It was up 82 percent at 436.70 euros by 1105 GMT.  After several European IPOs were pulled in May, bankers say strong interest in Adyen may spill over into other upcoming deals, such as German online furniture retailer Home24, which was due to price on Wednesday.  The soaring share price prompted debate over whether the offer had been underpriced.  Investors who sold in the all-secondary offering \u201cstill own about 85 percent, so focusing on what they own, they might be happy,\u201d said one banker whose bank had a role in the IPO.  \u201cThe one thing for sure is this helps the IPO sentiment in Europe.\u201d  One banker who was not involved said the issue, which will raise 947 million euros including an overallotment option, was underpriced.  \u201cIt is difficult to be in the shoes of the pricing banks ...  typically a successful IPO goes up 10-15 percent,\u201d he said.  \u201cBut the message is not that the IPO market is up and flying. Investors are very selective.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: Euro banknotes and coins are displayed in a shop in Brussels, Belgium November 14, 2017. REUTERS\/Eric Vidal\/File Photo  Prior to Adyen, the 10 biggest IPOs in Europe by gross proceeds so far this year rose less than 6 percent on average above their offer price on their first day of trading, according to Eikon data and Reuters calculations.  Adyen\u2019s sale was only open to institutional investors, and the company said on Tuesday it had been oversubscribed \u201cmultiple times.\u201d  Books had been covered at the top price within an hour of the offer being launched on June 5, which the head of a syndicate involved in the float said may have been \u201cunprecedented.\u201d  Adyen helps retailers take customer payments and usher them through complicated payment networks quickly.  Its fast growth, its flashy customer and investor lists, together with the relatively small number of shares on offer, recent strength in technology shares, and fevered M&A in the payments segment, all bolstered demand for shares of the previously little-known company.  Still, there are reasons for investor caution. The issue price was more than 70 times Adyen\u2019s 2017 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 99.4 million euros. The company, which is debt-free and profitable, says it expects to grow sales by 25-35 percent annually.  Among major risk factors in its prospectus, Adyen cited fierce competition and the fact that its top 10 clients, which also include Vodafone, Uber and Spotify, represent around 33 percent of sales.  Those high-profile clients may demand concessions or defect to competitors, as eBay did when it decided to abandon former owner PayPal for Adyen in January. It later emerged that eBay was offered warrants worth up to a 5 percent stake in Adyen in exchange.  Adyen will face competition from rivals like WorldPay WP.O, which was bought last year by U.S. credit-card processing company Vantiv for $10.4 billion.  U.S. giant PayPal PYPL.O agreed to buy smartphone payment terminal provider iZettle last month for $2.2 billion. Worldline bought Swiss payments processor SIX Group for $2.75 billion.  U.S. fintech rivals such as Square and Stripe are also growing quickly, and some major online retailers including Amazon AMZN.O and Alibaba BABA.N are developing their own payment systems.  Adyen\u2019s offer is primarily a way for existing investors, which include the likes of General Atlantic, Index Ventures and Iconiq Capital, the Silicon Valley fund that is an investment vehicle for the founders of Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter.  Including overallotments, existing shareholders sold 13.4 percent of shares in the offering, which is secondary only.  With remaining shares subject to a six-month lockup period, only a relatively small number of shares were in play on the first day of trading. In the first hour of trade, a little more than 600,000 shares traded hands - only 2 percent of the total outstanding.  \u201cLiquidity is thin. People are sitting on their shares and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the price up,\u201d said one person familiar with the deal.  Adyen co-founder and CEO Pieter van der Does, whose around 1.6 million shares in the company are worth nearly 700 million euros at current prices, eschewed any public appearances in the run-up to the IPO, meeting only with private investors. That made some sense given the business-to-business nature of the company and a business model that may not be readily understood by retail investors.  Less traditional was his decision not to ring the gong or hold any celebration at Euronext in Amsterdam on Wednesday. Some observers were also surprised by his decision not to opt for a listing on Nasdaq.  \u201cI\u2019m very proud to be building this company with such a great team,\u201d Van der Does said in a statement issued on Tuesday night. \u201cThis listing will only help us to continue to do what we are doing now: helping our merchants grow and reshaping the payments industry.\u201d  Investor Jan Hammer of Index Ventures, Adyen\u2019s largest shareholder, said the successful listing was \u201cproof that even in a traditional and highly regulated industry, building a powerful, global business is possible\u201d.  He said the company handled 108 billion euros in transactions last year out of an estimated $23 trillion globally and had room to grow despite the competition.  Another personal familiar with the IPO said it \u201cwasn\u2019t mispriced.\u201d  \u201cThey wanted pop,\u201d he said, referring to the company\u2019s founders and early investors.","115":"Figurines are seen in front of the Facebook logo in this illustration taken March 20, 2018.

The structure is intended to foster trust and stabilize the price.  Although Libra prices may not always align with the underlying assets, holders should have a \u201chigh degree of assurance\u201d that they can convert coins into traditional currency based on an exchange rate, according to the project\u2019s information.  Libra will trade on a network of exchanges, which Facebook did not identify.

The Libra blockchain will be permissioned, meaning that only entities authorized by the governing association will be able to run the computers. Its governance differs from bitcoin, which does not have an entity in charge.  The software will be \u201copen source,\u201d meaning companies outside the association can build applications on top of it.  The association plans to move toward a permissionless blockchain within five years of Libra\u2019s launch.  THE ASSOCIATION  The Libra Association is a 28-member independent non-profit based in Geneva, Switzerland. It will oversee major decisions about the digital coin.  Members include Mastercard Inc, Visa Inc, Spotify Technology SA, PayPal Holdings Inc, eBay Inc, Uber Technologies Inc and Vodafone Group Plc, as well as venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Thrive Capital.  There is a minimum $10 million investment to join, except for non-profit members like financial inclusion group Kiva. The association aims to have 100 members by launch.  Each will have one vote on important issues. Facebook will be a member via Calibra, a newly created subsidiary that will offer a digital wallet for Libra.  THE WALLET  Individuals and merchants will be able to use Calibra to store, send and receive Libras.

Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said at the time that the changes would help protect Facebook users, and that \u201cgetting this right was deeply important to me and all of us at Facebook because inclusivity is a core value for our company.\u201d  While Facebook has begun implementing the changes, the complaint said it still allows financial services ads limiting such services to \u201cpeople ages 24 to 40,\u201d \u201cmen ages 20 and older,\u201d and other comparable groups.  Facebook is the world\u2019s second-largest seller of online ads, and on Wednesday said around 2.8 billion people use at least one of its platforms each month.  \u201cWe recognize that Facebook has taken significant steps to prevent discrimination in housing and jobs,\u201d as well as credit ads, said Romer-Friedman, a lawyer at Outten & Golden. \u201cThe company can do a lot more.\u201d  Thursday\u2019s complaint seeks damages for millions of Facebook users under California\u2019s Unruh Civil Rights Act, which allows $4,000 of damages per violation.

Zuckerberg said the world\u2019s largest social network would start \u201caggressively opening up remote hiring\u201d in July, expecting that about half its workforce would eventually do their jobs outside Facebook\u2019s offices over the next five to 10 years.  The company would take a more \u201cmeasured approach\u201d with existing employees based on job function and past performance, he said, and set a January 1, 2021 deadline for staff to update the company on their new locations for tax purposes.  The move is the most significant yet by a tech giant to reimagine what work culture will look like in a post-coronavirus world, as the pandemic upends office and commuting habits for companies around the world.  It follows similar announcements earlier this month by social media rival Twitter and payments company Square, both led by Jack Dorsey, which were the first tech companies to permit remote work indefinitely.  But Facebook is a much larger company, with nearly 50,000 employees, and it went further in laying out a novel proposed structure for remote work. Its decision is likely to have a pronounced impact on the San Francisco area, where the tech sector\u2019s rapid growth has strained regional infrastructure.  Facebook, which has already said it will stick to plans to hire 10,000 engineers and product employees this year, will also build three new \u201chubs\u201d in Atlanta, Dallas and Denver where remote workers in those areas could occasionally convene.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cThese aren\u2019t necessarily offices,\u201d Zuckerberg said, although the company would likely create \u201csome kind of physical space\u201d to foster community. \u201cThe idea for these hubs is that we want to create scale. We want to focus the recruiting energy in some cities where we can get to hundreds of engineers.\u201d  The total effect on costs of the shift to remote work is unclear, Zuckerberg said. Savings related to real estate, food and labor costs will be partially offset by additional expenses for travel and logistics associated with home offices.  He said the company was committed to keeping its current office spaces, which include a tony Menlo Park headquarters designed by architect Frank Gehry, featuring a rooftop garden and a courtyard sheltered by redwood trees.  The sky-high compensation packages common in Silicon Valley will not necessarily be transferred to other parts of the country, however. Zuckerberg said salaries will be adjusted if Facebook employees opt to live in less-pricey regions, consistent with the company\u2019s existing cost-of-living calculations.  \u201cWe pay very well, basically at the top of the market, but we pay a market rate. And that varies by location, so we\u2019re going to continue that principle here,\u201d he said.  Internal surveys indicate that about 60% of Facebook employees preferred a flexible approach to work, with a mix of remote and office-based functions, Zuckerberg said.  Within that group, he said, just under half reported they would move to another region if given the option.  He said there were no differences in the results by gender.","130":"(Adds Facebook comments; paragraphs 5-9)  March 18 (Reuters) - A consortium of global technology firms has shared on its collective database the digital fingerprints of more than 800 versions of the video of New Zealand\u2019s mass shootings that killed 50 people, it said on Monday.  While it was not the first internet broadcast of a violent crime, the livestream of the massacre showed that stopping gory footage from spreading online persists as a major challenge for tech companies despite years of investment.  Last Friday, social media users intent on sharing the mosque shooting video were said to have used several methods to create a new version with a digital fingerprint different from the original, so as to evade companies\u2019 detection systems.  \"This incident highlights the importance of industry cooperation regarding the range of terrorists and violent extremists operating online,\" the grouping, which includes Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google and Twitter Inc, said here of the attack.  Facebook, the world\u2019s largest social media network with about 2.3 billion monthly users around the world, said the original video on its service, a live broadcast of a gunman firing in and around a mosque, was seen fewer than 200 times.  An archived copy drew about 3,800 additional views on Facebook before the company removed it, Facebook said in a blog post on Monday, but a user on online forum 8chan had already copied the video and posted a link on a file-sharing service.  \u201cBefore we were alerted to the video, a user on 8chan posted a link to a copy of the video on a file-sharing site,\u201d it added.  No users had filed complaints with Facebook about offensive content in the livestream, it said, adding that its first user complaint came over the archived copy, 12 minutes after the 17-minute broadcast ended.  Administrators for 8chan did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment, but have said previously they are cooperating with law enforcement.  The gunman initiated the livestream using an app designed for extreme sports enthusiasts, with copies still being shared on social media hours later.  Late on Saturday Facebook said it had removed 1.5 million videos within 24 hours after the Christchurch attack.  New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said she wants to discuss live streaming with Facebook, and some of the country\u2019s firms are considering whether to pull advertising from social media.  The Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT) was created in 2017 under pressure from governments in Europe and the United States after a spate of deadly attacks.  It shares technical solutions for the removal of terrorist content, commissions research to assist its efforts to fight such content and works more with counter-terrorism experts.","131":"Aug 5 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc:  * FACEBOOK SAYS HAS TAKEN DOWN POST FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP\u2019S FACEBOOK PAGE BECAUSE IT BROKE COVID-19 MISINFORMATION RULES Further company coverage:","132":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook Inc, whose digital currency project Libra has been abandoned by several high-profile partners including PayPal, Visa and Mastercard, still expects to get 100 banks and financial firms on board once it addresses regulatory concerns, the head of the project said on Wednesday.

Such currencies are directed at retail customers and they are based on existing infrastructure, which would allow them to spread quickly.  Facebook\u2019s aim is to connect Libra to the WhatsApp messaging service, adding a payment leg to an already global application. Such a function would immediately give Libra a global role.  \u201cThe available evidence therefore suggests that transaction and switching costs are much smaller in the case of retail consumer payments than they are for traditional currencies used for wholesale cross-border trade and finance,\u201d Coeure added.  \u201cLibra has undoubtedly been a wake-up call for central banks to strengthen their efforts to improve existing payment systems,\u201d Coeure added.  Authorities\u2019 response should be to provide faster, cheaper payment services and global cooperation in coming up with the rules for central bank digital money, he said.  \u201cThe next natural step would be for global central banks to join forces and jointly investigate the feasibility of central bank digital currencies based on common technical standards.\u201d","135":"(Adds details on hearing, postponement)  WASHINGTON, July 23 (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional hearing scheduled for next week to question the CEOs of Facebook Inc , Amazon.com Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc and Apple Inc is set to be delayed, according to sources familiar with the matter.

Lawmakers in the United States and Europe are demanding to know more about the company\u2019s privacy practices after a whistleblower said consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed data to target U.S. and British voters in close-run elections.  Facebook said the company had received invitations to testify before Congress and that they were talking to legislators.  Facebook shares closed down 4.9 percent on Tuesday and have fallen almost 18 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.  The tech sector is down 5.2 percent for March and on track for its worst month since April 2016.

Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower who once worked at Cambridge Analytica, said on Monday that Canadian company AggregateIQ had developed the software that used the algorithms from the Facebook data to target Republican voters in the 2016 U.S. election.  AggregateIQ did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wylie\u2019s remarks. Cambridge Analytica said it had not shared any of the Facebook profile data with AggregateIQ.  Cambridge Analytica has said it did not use Facebook data in Trump\u2019s campaign, and that it had deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party app in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.

The Menlo Park, California-based company said managers of pages will see a new tab from Thursday informing them of Facebook removing content that violates its community standards policies.","142":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc will no longer feed user phone numbers provided to it for two-factor authentication into its \u201cpeople you may know\u201d feature, as part of a wide-ranging overhaul of its privacy practices, the company told Reuters.  FILE PHOTO: A woman looks at the Facebook logo on an iPad in this photo illustration taken June 3, 2018. REUTERS\/Regis Duvignau\/Illustration  Revelations last year that Facebook was using personal data obtained for two-factor authentication to serve advertisements enraged privacy advocates, who called the practice deceptive and said it eroded trust in an essential digital security tool.  It had already stopped allowing those phone numbers to be used for advertising purposes in June, the company said, and is now beginning to extend that separation to friend suggestions.  Facebook initiated the updates in connection with its $5 billion settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which required it to boost safeguards on user data to resolve a government probe into its privacy practices.  The FTC order, which is still pending approval in court, said Facebook failed to disclose that the phone numbers provided for two-factor authentication also would be used for advertising, and specifically barred that approach to security tools.  Michel Protti, a long-time Facebook executive who took over as chief privacy officer for product this summer and is leading the overhaul, told Reuters the two-factor authentication update was an example of the company\u2019s new privacy model at work.  The change - which is happening in Ecuador, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Libya and Cambodia this week and will be introduced globally early next year - will prevent any phone numbers provided during sign-up for two-factor authentication from being used to make friend suggestions.  Existing users of the tool will not be affected, but can de-link their two-factor authentication numbers from the friend suggestion feature by deleting them and adding them again.  The separation of two-factor authentication from advertising this summer applied to both new and existing users, a company spokeswoman said.  Before the latest change, Facebook conducted a review to ensure \u201cthe system updates supporting our privacy statements were done correctly,\u201d said Protti, which \u201cadds more layers of process and rigor to the vetting of our technical work to make sure our public statements match our operations.\u201d  The beefed-up reviews of new products aim to minimize any data collected, document where the data goes and provide sufficient transparency around how products work, he said.  That process led to changes in the phrasing Facebook used to inform people of the update, the spokeswoman added, although Facebook declined to specify how the disclosures were altered.  Protti, who along with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg will sign quarterly privacy certifications to the FTC, said his team has completed an assessment begun in August of Facebook\u2019s privacy risks and started cataloguing protections in place to mitigate those risks.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  The social network has been at the center of controversy over suspected Russian manipulation of the 2016 U.S. presidential election via its platform, and the leak of personal data of 87 million users to a political consultancy that advised Donald Trump\u2019s team.  A German data privacy regulator said it was opening a non-compliance procedure against Facebook in relation to the data leak to the consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, that was exposed a month ago.  The city-state of Hamburg\u2019s Data Protection Commissioner, Johannes Caspar, notified Facebook in writing that he had opened a probe into suspected data abuse. The case could lead to a fine of up to 300,000 euros ($370,000).  \u201cFirst we will seek a statement from Facebook and then hearings will begin,\u201d said Caspar\u2019s spokesman, Martin Schemm.  Such a fine, if imposed, would only be a pinprick for Facebook, which recorded revenues of more than $40 billion last year.  But the case marks a warning shot ahead of the introduction of tougher privacy rules across the European Union on May 25 that foresee penalties of up to four percent of worldwide revenues for serious violations.  \u201cWe remain strongly committed to protecting people\u2019s information,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman said in response to news of the probe. \u201cWe appreciate any opportunity to answer questions by data protection authorities.\u201d  CHARM DEFENSIVE  Facing a hostile audience, a Facebook executive earlier met German lawmakers and repeated apologies by CEO Mark Zuckerberg over the Cambridge Analytica leak.  \u201cWhat happened with Cambridge Analytica represents a huge violation of trust, and we are deeply sorry,\u201d Joel Kaplan, vice president for global public policy, said according to the text of his prepared remarks.  Kaplan said Facebook would roll out a new \u2018view ads\u2019 feature, designed to make political advertising more transparent, in time for a regional election being held in the German state of Bavaria in October.  Social media experts say Germany\u2019s parliamentary election last September was less affected by the spread of \u2018fake news\u2019 than the U.S. vote, where Trump pulled off a stunning come-from-behind victory.  Yet the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) was able to capitalize on a wave of discontent with an active campaign on social media, winning seats in parliament for the first time as Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats polled poorly.  The Bavarian party closely allied to Merkel\u2019s conservatives is seeking re-election in October. Its leading figure in the federal government, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, is taking a hard line on immigration in a bid to squeeze the AfD vote.

Bitcoin fell 11.1% from Friday to $9,855 early on Monday, its lowest since July 2. The original cryptocurrency slumped 10.4% on Sunday alone, its second-biggest daily drop this year. It was last up 1.3% at $10,319.  Politicians and financial regulators across the world have called for close scrutiny of Facebook\u2019s Libra coin, with concerns ranging from consumer protection and privacy to its potential systemic risks given the social media giant\u2019s global reach.  In a sign of widening U.S. attention, a proposal to prevent big technology companies from functioning as financial institutions or issuing digital currencies has been circulated for discussion by Democratic lawmakers, according to a copy of the draft legislation seen by Reuters.  U.S. President Donald Trump had last week criticized bitcoin, Libra and other cryptocurrencies, demanding that firms seek a banking charter and subject themselves to U.S. and global regulations if they wanted to \u201cbecome a bank\u201d.  Bitcoin, which initially shrugged off Trump\u2019s Tweet, fell sharply after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell called for a halt to Facebook\u2019s project until concerns from privacy to money-laundering were addressed.  \u201cTogether they have increased the tail risk that the U.S. will look to crack down on it in some way,\u201d said Jamie Farquhar, portfolio manager at crypto firm NKB Group in London.  Underscoring the growing attention on Facebook\u2019s plans, Japanese authorities have also set up a working group to look at Libra\u2019s possible impact on monetary policy and financial regulation, government sources told Reuters.  European Central Bank policymaker Benoit Coeure is due to deliver a preliminary report on the matter at a meeting of G7 finance ministers this week in Chantilly, north of Paris.  Bitcoin climbed nearly 55% in nine days after Facebook unveiled its plans for Libra on June 18, touching an 18-month high of nearly $14,000. The project has boosted hopes among some investors that cryptocurrencies could gain wider acceptance.","150":"(Reuters) - The first of what\u2019s likely to be a string of suits by investors accusing Facebook of fraudulently concealing unauthorized data harvesting was filed late Tuesday in federal court in San Francisco. The class action complaint alleges that since at least February 2017, Facebook failed to disclose in public securities filings that the company allowed outside firms such as Cambridge Analytica to access the personal data of millions of unwitting Facebook users.  Over the past few days, the New York Times\u2019 disclosure of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s extensive access to Facebook data and subsequent reporting on regulatory fallout led to a drop in share price from a high of about $185 on Monday to $164.83 at the close of trading on Tuesday. The complaint also cites a previous stock drop, in May 2017, when France\u2019s Commission on Informatics and Liberty fined Facebook about $230,000 (then the maximum) for failing to block advertisers\u2019 access to user data.  The class action was filed by an individual investor, Fan Yuan, who is represented by the shareholder class action firm Pomerantz. That doesn\u2019t mean Yuan or Pomerantz will end up running the case. Under the rules for securities class action, other Facebook investors now have 60 days to decide if they want to compete with Yuan to be named lead plaintiff in an appointment process that typically favors institutional investors. Several plaintiffs\u2019 firms have issued press releases urging Facebook investors to contact them, a standard practice in securities class action litigation. Pomerantz co-managing partner Jeremy Lieberman said his firm is consulting with its pension fund clients to gauge their intentions.  \u201cEveryone knows this is a winner,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cThis is a snowballing issue for Facebook. It\u2019s only going to get worse as more facts come out.\u201d  Perhaps. Facebook didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment from my Reuters colleague Jon Stempel on the securities class action and a related privacy breach class action filed in the same court. Facebook deputy general counsel has said in response to the Cambridge disclosures that the company is \u201ccommitted to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people\u2019s information (and) will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.\"  Investors will have to show Facebook officials knowingly deceived them about advertisers\u2019 ability to access user data \u2013 an assertion the company continues to deny. According to a March 16 blog post from Facebook, Cambridge obtained access, via an app developed by a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge, only to information from consenting users, in keeping with its security policies. The company insists it was the professor who violated Facebook policies by sharing the data he obtained with Cambridge Analytica, which compounded the violation by refusing to delete the information.  Obviously, the facts of Facebook\u2019s relationship with the Cambridge professor and Cambridge Analytica will have to be uncovered \u2013 possibly through congressional testimony or an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, which previously obtained a consent decree from the company \u2013 before we can realistically assess whether Facebook misrepresented its privacy policies to shareholders. (If it turns out Facebook was allowing advertisers to access user data without their consent, that March 16 blog post will surely feature in shareholders\u2019 amended complaint.)  For years, corporate defendants in data breach class actions have managed to squelch class actions by investors alleging misrepresentations about the security of users\u2019 personal information. But a milestone settlement earlier this month may portend bigger exposure for defendants like Facebook.  On March 2, Altaba (formerly Yahoo) agreed to pay $80 million to settle a securities class action by Yahoo investors who had accused the company of failing to disclose hacks that left users vulnerable to identity theft. As securities law expert Kevin LaCroix pointed out in a blog post about the Yahoo settlement, it seemed to mark a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d for plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers who had struggled to find a way to win securities class actions based on data disclosure. After the Yahoo settlement, LaCroix predicted, shareholder lawyers would sense opportunity when companies\u2019 share prices dropped significantly in response to reports of data misuse.  The Facebook case seems to bear out LaCroix\u2019s prediction \u2013 and it\u2019s worth noting that Pomerantz, the firm that filed the first Facebook case, was lead counsel in Yahoo.","151":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The lawsuits filed against Facebook allege the company\u2019s pattern of buying up competitors has turned it into a monopoly, but several experts said the complaints fell short on explaining how the social media platform\u2019s actions have hurt consumers.  FILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is displayed on a smartphone in this illustration taken January 6, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  The U.S. Federal Trade Commission and nearly every U.S. state filed lawsuits against the social media company on Wednesday - making Facebook the second big tech company to face a major legal challenge this year after the U.S. Justice Department sued Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google in October.  Stephen Yelderman, a professor at Notre Dame law school and a former trial attorney at the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, said the lawsuits lack compelling examples of consumer harm. \u201cI think if they had great stories about such harm, they definitely would have featured those,\u201d he added.  Yelderman and other antitrust experts said that as the case proceeds the agency and states will call economic and market experts to testify about the harms they say are caused by Facebook, even as such examples were largely missing from the initial complaints.  Newer legal theories are taking a broader approach to what may constitute harm given the big changes in how consumers interact with and can be impacted by companies.  The lawsuits against Facebook allege the social media platform\u2019s conduct around its acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 was anti-competitive and that those mergers must be unwound.  Some experts said it would be a challenge to argue an antitrust case retrospectively, and that it is easier to establish that an acquisition would cause consumers harm before a merger is approved.  Andrew Gavil, a professor at Howard University School of Law, cited a landmark case against Microsoft in 1998, in which U.S. regulators struggled to define harm to consumers and went instead with the theory that Microsoft\u2019s conduct had prevented future competition - helping the company eventually avoid a forced breakup.  \u201cThe Facebook lawsuits can be hard to prove because you have to persuade the court that the inference of that kind of harm is strong based on the conduct,\u201d Gavil said.  \u2018THEY DON\u2019T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE\u2019  A source familiar with Facebook\u2019s thinking also told Reuters the idea of whether the company\u2019s actions have caused consumers harm \u201cwill be at the core of this litigation.\u201d  \u201c(Regulators) wave their hands at this a little bit and say there might have been more choice and other options for people but they don\u2019t have any evidence that suggests ... that \u2018but for\u2019 (Facebook) the world will be more competitive,\u201d the source said.  Facebook has called the lawsuits \u201crevisionist history\u201d and will continue making that a part of its defense, the source said.  On Thursday, Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told employees during a Q&A that the company faces vigorous competition, according to audio of the meeting reviewed by Reuters.  Some antitrust experts have pushed back against the idea of seeking to prove harm to consumers and argued that new antitrust lawsuits must focus on a much broader definition of harm.  This idea has found increasing support in Washington. A House panel released a wide-ranging report on tech companies earlier this year in which it called for establishing a legal standard \u201cdesigned to protect not just consumers, but also workers, entrepreneurs, independent businesses, open markets, a fair economy, and democratic ideals.\u201d  Sarah Miller, executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, a Washington-based group focused on monopolies, said it is illegal to foreclose competition or acquire rivals to maintain monopoly power.  \u201cPoor content, more misinformation and disinformation, poor privacy protections ... the lawsuits make a clear case about the harms caused by the lack of competition,\u201d she said.","152":"FILE PHOTO: A small toy figure is seen on representations of the Bitcoin virtual currency in this illustration picture, December 26, 2017.

Facebook is keeping costs in check better than some investors anticipated but is facing challenges growing users, causing shares to swing in both directions after the third-quarter results.  Shares of Facebook were down 3 percent to $141.50 after seesawing between positive and negative territory after the bell, when shares had closed up 2.9 percent at $146.22.  Shares fell again after Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, on a conference call with analysts, repeated the company\u2019s warning that shifting user behavior would leave revenue and cost growth out of sync for \u201csome time.\u201d  He also noted costs would continue to rise to deal with safety and security issues.  \u201cThe upcoming elections will be a real test of the protections we\u2019ve put in place,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cWith a community of more than 2 billion people, we will see all the good and bad that humanity can do. And we will never be perfect.\u201d  Big winners on Wall Street in recent years, internet giants including Facebook, Amazon.com Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc have suffered a battering over the last month.  Slowing growth after years of strong results has been a top concern, and Facebook\u2019s weak results underscored some of those fears.  Still, the company had warned about sagging profit and revenue growth. Facebook\u2019s spending has ballooned as it tries to fortify itself against fraudsters and hackers, and as it invests in more engaging content such as video.  \u201cIt was a pretty good quarter and everybody was expecting a disaster,\u201d said Ivan Feinseth, analyst at Tigress Financial Partners.  James Cordwell, analyst at Atlantic Equities, described the results as \u201clikely something of a relief to the market.\u201d  Total expenses in the third quarter surged to $7.95 billion, up 53 percent compared with a year ago. But operating margin fell only 2 percentage points from last quarter, to 42 percent.  Facebook\u2019s revenue was in line with expectations, when accounting for what the company said were unfavorable foreign exchange rates.  Overall third-quarter revenue was $13.73 billion, up 33 percent from the same period last year and below the $13.78 billion average analyst estimate in Refinitiv data.  Quarterly profit of $5.14 billion, or $1.76 per share, was up 9 percent from the same period last year and above the average per-share estimate of $1.48.  As Facebook user growth has tapered off, its ad sales had continued to surge as it found ways to better target ads to draw clicks and views. Emerging businesses Instagram and WhatsApp are seen as hopes for picking up the slack from flattening usage of the main Facebook app.  Facebook lost 1 million monthly users in Europe for the second straight quarter. It gained 1 million monthly users in the United States after holding steady last quarter.  The social network\u2019s reputation has suffered from a data breach affecting 29 million users in September and a privacy scandal involving a British political consulting firm in March.  It also has been rocked by domestic and international information warfare on its services, including WhatsApp and Instagram, and a wave of executive departures.  Still, the company has managed to gain some users. The company said 2.6 billion users interact with at least one of its apps each month, up from 2.5 billion when it released the figure for the first time last quarter to emphasize that its potential audience for advertisers is unrivaled in size.  Monthly and daily users of the main Facebook app compared with a year ago were up 10 percent to 2.27 billion and up 9 percent to 1.49 billion, respectively. Estimates were for 2.292 billion and 1.508 billion, according to Refinitiv averages.  The company said the third-quarter figures would have been slightly higher except it changed the measurement method because it found some user activity had been misclassified. Changes to past quarters were immaterial, Facebook said.  A few financial analysts are concerned that the company\u2019s operational problems are so vast that costs will continue to rise out of sync with revenue.  The company\u2019s weakest quarterly sales growth as a publicly traded company, 32.2 percent, came in each of its first two reporting quarters in 2012.  \u201cThe fact that problems keep emerging reinforces our view that the company is not as in control of its business as it needs to be,\u201d Pivotal Research senior analyst Brian Wieser told clients in an email this month.  Facebook suffered the biggest one-day wipeout in U.S. stock market history after issuing the grim guidance in July, with shares falling almost 19 percent.

U.S. Senators Edward Markey, Richard Blumenthal, who are Democrats, and Josh Hawley, a Republican, told the agency that a $5 billion settlement, which was reported on Friday, \u201cis woefully inadequate.\u201d  Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Reuters and others reported last week that the FTC had voted to approve a roughly $5 billion settlement with Facebook over its investigation into the social media company\u2019s handling of user data. The Wall Street Journal had been first to report the deal.  The FTC has been investigating allegations Facebook inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The probe has focused on whether the data sharing violated a 2011 consent agreement between Facebook and the regulator.  In their letter, the three senators called the proposed settlement \u201cwoefully inadequate.\u201d  \u201cWe are concerned that the FTC has failed to impose strict structural reforms and managerial accountability that would put an end to Facebook\u2019s privacy violations,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.  In particular, the senators pressed the FTC on how the penalty was determined, whether founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg was interviewed as part of the probe, whether Zuckerberg or other executives were named in the new proposed settlement and whether new restrictions on data collection were agreed to.  Facebook\u2019s revenue for the first quarter of this year was $15.1 billion while its net income was $2.43 billion. It would have been higher, but Facebook set aside $3 billion for the FTC penalty.

Brad Parscale, who was Trump\u2019s online ads chief in 2016, last year called onsite \u201cembeds\u201d from Facebook crucial to the candidate\u2019s victory. Facebook has said that Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton was offered identical help, but she accepted a different level than Trump.  Google and Twitter did not immediately respond to requests to comment on whether they also would pull back support.  Facebook said it could offer assistance to more candidates globally by focusing on offering support through an online portal instead of in person. It said that political organizations still would be able to contact employees to receive basic training on using Facebook or for assistance on getting ads approved.  Bloomberg first reported the new approach.  Facebook, Twitter, and Google served as \u201cquasi-digital consultants\u201d to U.S. election campaigns in 2016, researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and University of Utah found in a paper published a year ago.  The companies helped campaigns navigate their services\u2019 ad systems and \u201cactively\u201d shaped campaign communication by suggesting what types of messages to direct to whom, the researchers stated.  Facebook\u2019s involvement with Trump\u2019s campaign drew scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers after the company found its user data had separately been misused by political data firm Cambridge Analytica, which consulted for the Trump campaign.  In written testimony to U.S. lawmakers in June, Facebook said its employees had not spotted any misuse \u201cin the course of their interactions with Cambridge Analytica\u201d during the election.","161":"FILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is displayed on a smartphone in this illustration taken January 6, 2020.

One user said she received a message saying \u201clink is not allowed\u201d after attempting to post a Vox article about the coronavirus in her Instagram profile.  The issue arose a day after Facebook announced that it was sending home for public health reasons all contract workers who perform content review services for the social media giant, which mostly outsources the work to independent companies.  \u201cWe believe the investments we\u2019ve made over the past three years have prepared us for this situation,\u201d Facebook wrote in a blog post announcing the move, adding it would increase its reliance on \u201cproactive detection\u201d to remove violating content.  \u201cThat said, there may be some limitations to this approach and we may see some longer response times and make more mistakes as a result,\u201d the post said.","162":"Feb 26 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc said on Wednesday it would ban advertisements referring to any cures or prevention around the coronavirus outbreak, and those that create a sense of urgency around the situation.

The announcement by the social-media giant comes as it faces increasing regulatory scrutiny over the type of content posted on its platform, specifically items reflecting extreme ideologies and fake news.  Last month, Facebook said that it would remove content about the virus \u201cwith false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organizations and local health authorities\u201d, joining companies like TikTok and Pinterest.","163":"(Reuters) - Reports of the demise of the digital advertising market due to the coronavirus outbreak appear exaggerated as the tech giants dominating the online ads business, Google and Facebook, said this week they saw early signs that the worst could be over.  FILE PHOTO: Facebook, Google and Twitter logos are seen in this combination photo from Reuters files. REUTERS  Their remarks countered Wall Street expectations of a devastation of the market as hard-hit brands in travel and autos, traditionally big ad spenders, have pulled marketing dollars and as small businesses, the lifeblood of big tech companies\u2019 businesses, have shut down.  At Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet Inc, first-quarter total revenue grew 13% from the previous year to $41.2 billion, while Facebook Inc\u2019s ad sales rose 17% to $17.44 billion.  They issued first-quarter results that factored in only two weeks of the widespread stay-at-home orders in the United States. But both companies also reassured investors that revenue for the first three weeks of April showed signs of stability, following lower revenue in March.  Alphabet, Facebook and Snap Inc credited direct response ads, or ads that solicit a direct action, such as clicking a link, using a coupon code or downloading mobile games, for propping up sales during the pandemic.  Such ads help advertisers get the most for their money by encouraging immediate response from audiences and are easier to measure, since brands can see how many people clicked on a link or took an action after seeing the ad.  Brand advertising that is used to spread awareness and name recognition for a company, but whose effectiveness is often more difficult to measure, was harder hit. Alphabet said on Tuesday brand advertising declined on YouTube in mid-March, when the pandemic accelerated in the United States.  Ad prices drop when marketers lower their spending and demand for digital ads decline, and direct response advertisers have been taking advantage of that, said David Campanelli, chief investment officer at ad agency Horizon Media.  \u201cThis will likely continue through 2Q as we expect pricing to remain low for the foreseeable future,\u201d he said.  Facebook executives said on Wednesday they expected direct response advertising to continue to drive ad sales and that the coronavirus pandemic only reinforced the importance of the strategy.  Still, Facebook was cautious, given economists are forecasting a global downturn in the second quarter and \u201cif history were a guide, would suggest the potential for an even more severe advertising industry contraction,\u201d said David Wehner, Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, during an earnings call.  Alphabet warned that the second quarter could be difficult because the early April trends may not hold.  Snap Inc, which owns messaging app Snapchat, said it would shift resources on its ad sales team to serve direct response advertisers better, due to the success of the category.  But Twitter alarmed investors on Thursday as it pointed to a 27% decline in ad revenue as a sign of what the company has seen so far in April.  Twitter\u2019s ad business is heavily event-driven and \u201cthe suspension of major sporting leagues in March will have hurt its bottom line and will continue to do so as long as social distancing and stay-at-home measures remain in place,\u201d said Jasmine Enberg, senior analyst at research firm eMarketer.","164":"WASHINGTON, July 17 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc will face more questioning on Wednesday by U.S. lawmakers over its planned cryptocurrency after a bruising first bout when senators from both parties condemned the project, saying the company had not shown it could be trusted.

Since then, it has faced criticism from policymakers and financial watchdogs at home and abroad who fear widespread adoption of the digital currency by Facebook\u2019s 2.38 billion users could upend the financial system.  On Tuesday, the Facebook executive overseeing the project, David Marcus, was grilled by the Senate Banking Committee on the possible risks posed by Libra to data privacy, consumer protections and money laundering controls. Senator Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the panel, said the currency plan was \u201cdelusional.\u201d  Facebook has been on the defense against a backlash over mishandling user data and not doing enough to prevent Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  Marcus, who was president of PayPal from 2012 to 2014, will testify before Congress again on Wednesday, this time before the Democrat-controlled House Financial Services Committee.  That hearing could prove to be even more tense. The panel has already circulated draft legislation that could kill the project by banning Facebook and other tech firms from entering the financial services space.

In future we will have to regulate companies like Facebook much more strictly.\u201d  The firm has faced a global outcry over allegations that data from millions of users was improperly harvested by consultancy Cambridge Analytica to target U.S. and British voters in close-run elections.  Facebook\u2019s shares fell more than 5 percent on Wall Street on Monday after the U.S. consumer protection regulator made public the fact it is investigating the firm over the Cambridge Analytica link.

The social media giant will again face demands for reform at Thursday\u2019s meeting, including shareholder proposals that call for revamping the company\u2019s voting structure and ousting Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg as chairman.  The measures have little chance of succeeding, as a dual class share structure gives Zuckerberg and other insiders control of about 58% of the votes. And many investors have shrugged off the scandals swirling around the company, as it has beaten Wall Street\u2019s estimates for revenue growth and continues to add users globally. But even though the votes are largely symbolic, they are still seen as a useful barometer of investor sentiment about how well the social media icon is coping with unprecedented challenges to its hands-off approach to content.  Last year, about 83% of shares held by outside investors voted for a proposal that would have the company move to a structure of one vote per share and do away with the supermajority shares.  A coalition of activist groups have urged big investors to reject Zuckerberg\u2019s nomination to the board this year, saying Facebook has failed to protect users, especially racial and religious minorities.  Led by consumer group Majority Action and civil rights advocate Color of Change, they gathered 125,000 signatures on a petition targeting BlackRock Inc, one of Facebook\u2019s biggest outside investors.  BlackRock\u2019s funds backed all of Facebook\u2019s director nominees last year, but also voted for two shareholder proposals that would have reorganized Facebook\u2019s governance structure.  \u201cFacebook has consistently proven its lack of care for its users and is ever more closely associated with the proliferation of racism and hate online,\u201d said Lisa Lindsley, capital markets advisor at SumOfUs, another group in the activist coalition and the one responsible for the 8-foot (2.5-meter) inflatable angry emoji.  \u201cIts latest actions to limit the consequences are too little and far too late,\u201d she said, noting the live-streaming on Facebook of the shooting that killed 51 people worshipping at two Christchurch mosques in New Zealand.  BlackRock declined to comment on the petition, with a spokesman saying it did not preview votes or comment on specific companies.  UNDER SCRUTINY  Facebook has been under scrutiny from regulators and shareholders since last year, when reporting revealed that the data of some 87 million users had been shared with now-defunct political data firm Cambridge Analytica.  The company has also come under fire over Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, which used social media to spread disinformation, and its frequently shifting policies around which content is permitted on its platform.  U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized the company on Wednesday, saying she was no longer willing to give Facebook the benefit of the doubt on Russia after it refused to remove a heavily edited video that attempted to make her look incoherent.  \u201cI thought it was unwittingly, but clearly they wittingly were accomplices and enablers of false information to go across Facebook,\u201d she said.  The comments raise the specter of harsher action in Congress against Facebook. Pelosi has previously warned that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields tech companies from legal liability for content created by their users, was a \u201cgift\u201d that had been abused and could be reconsidered.  Investors do not seem worried.  The company\u2019s stock jumped 10 percent after its last earnings report, even as it announced it was setting aside up to $5 billion for what could be the largest civil penalty ever paid to the Federal Trade Commission, which has been investigating Facebook over alleged privacy violations.  One of Facebook\u2019s largest fund investors, William Danoff of the $123 billion Fidelity Contrafund, did not mention any of Facebook\u2019s privacy issues in his most in his most recent quarterly commentary to investors.  He wrote only that, as his portfolio\u2019s second-largest holding, Facebook \u201cappeals to us based on growth in its various apps and revenue from advertisers that want to reach the firm\u2019s enormous base of daily active users.\u201d  Danoff has been a long-time backer of Facebook and previously indicated he was satisfied with the company\u2019s reform efforts to date.  Among other top Facebook investors, last year Vanguard Group Inc withheld support from Zuckerberg and Sandberg, and backed a measure to reform Facebook\u2019s voting structure.","174":"* Facebook up 1 pct, reversing course as Zuckerberg speaks  * Trump\u2019s missile warning to Russia raises conflict fears  * Syria tensions lift oil prices, boosting energy stocks  * Netflix gains, Goldman Sachs predicts a strong Q1 report  * Indexes: Dow down 0.57 pct, S&P dips 0.24 pct, Nasdaq flat (Updates to early afternoon)  By Sruthi Shankar  April 11 (Reuters) - A Facebook-led rebound in technology stocks in early afternoon on Wednesday helped Wall Street pare losses that were sparked by concerns about a U.S.-Russia conflict over Syria.  Earlier in the day, U.S. President Donald Trump warned Russia of imminent military action in Syria, declaring missiles \u201cwill be coming\u201d.  \u201cIt feels like there are expectations that the U.S. is going to take some action against Syria. The market, I don\u2019t believe, has priced one yet,\u201d said Phil Blancato, Chief Executive of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York.  The rising tensions sent oil prices surging, boosting energy stocks 1 percent higher. But the risk-off sentiment weighed on treasury yields, pushing financial stocks down 0.82 percent.  Facebook\u2019s shares were up 1.1 percent. They were down about 0.5 percent when Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg started his second day of testimony, but they flipped course as he pushed back on Congress members\u2019 suggestions that users do not have enough control of their data.  \u201cIt looks like investors are thinking he\u2019s doing a good job in front of a hard-to-please crowd,\u201d said Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.  \u201cHe\u2019s trying to make sure that his view of the company which is, that they are good stewards of data, gets heard and it\u2019s unclear if they are going to go unscathed with no regulation.\u201d  Facebook\u2019s gains helped the technology sector cut losses to a marginal 0.09 percent and briefly pushed the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 into positive territory.  At 12:53 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 fell 6.32 points, or 0.24 percent, at 2,650.55 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.31 points, flat percent-wise, at 7,094.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 139.87 points, or 0.57 percent, at 24,268.13. The index was weighed down by financials and industrial stocks, which are still reeling from the impact of the uncertainty on tariffs between the United States and China.  In a sign of the market cutting losses, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.33-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.14-to-1 ratio and on the Nasdaq, reversing course from earlier in the session when decliners slightly outnumbered advancers.  Volatility stayed low for most of the session. The CBOE volatility index was down 0.52 points at 19.95.  The Labor Department said U.S. consumer prices fell for the first time in 10 months in March, weighed down by lower gasoline costs, but underlying inflation continued to firm amid rising prices for healthcare and rental accommodation.  The CPI data, while not the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of inflation, comes ahead of the release of the minutes of the central bank\u2019s March meeting, in which it raised interest rates. Investors expect the minutes to reveal the Fed\u2019s thinking on the future path of rate hikes.  Among stocks, Netflix gained 3.3 percent after Goldman Sachs became the latest brokerage to predict the streaming company would top expectations when it reports results on Monday.  Industrial distributor Fastenal fell 7.2 percent after its earnings missed expectations. The stock was the biggest decliner on the S&P, followed by peer WW Grainger\u2019s 4.2 percent drop.

But Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended his company\u2019s ad-based business model said users were aware of a trade-off for free services.  Cook, speaking at the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, said Apple would support a U.S. privacy law and also touted the iPhone maker\u2019s commitment to protect users\u2019 data and privacy.  Apple, which designs many of its products so that it cannot see users\u2019 data, has largely avoided the data privacy scandals that have enmeshed its rivals Google and Facebook this year.  \u201cThe desire to put profits over privacy is nothing new,\u201d Cook told a packed audience of privacy regulators, corporate executives and other participants.  Issues over how data is used and how consumers can protect their personal information are under the spotlight after big breaches of data privacy involving millions of internet and social media users in Europe and the United States.  Cook in his speech cited former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis who in a Harvard Law Review article in 1890 warned that gossip was no longer the resource of the idle and the vicious but had become a trade.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  \u201cToday that trade has exploded into a data industrial complex. Our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency,\u201d Cook said.  \u201cThese scraps of data ... each one harmless enough on its own ... are carefully assembled, synthesized, traded, and sold,\u201d Cook said.  \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t sugarcoat the consequences. This is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them,\u201d he said.  FACEBOOK\u2019S AD-BASED MODEL  Zuckerberg, speaking via video message, said Facebook users were aware of the trade-off between a free service and advertisements.  \u201cInstead of charging people, we charge advertisers to show ads. People consistently tell us that they want a free service and that if they going to see ads to get it, then they want those ads to be relevant,\u201d he said.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Facebook was investing heavily in both security and privacy even as this impacts on its profitability, Zuckerberg said.  Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai welcomed the global focus on privacy, saying that the company was doing its part by taking measures to allow users more control over their data.  \u201cUser trust is the foundation for everything we do, and privacy and security are fundamental tenets of that,\u201d he said by video message. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working for years to provide more transparency and control for our users, and we appreciate the input and partnership from data protection authorities.\u201d  Cook also warned about governments abusing users\u2019 data and their trust, a concern for many with elections coming up in several countries.  \u201cRogue actors and even governments have taken advantage of user trust to deepen divisions, incite violence, and even undermine our shared sense of what is true and what is false.\u201d  Cook said Apple fully backed a federal privacy law in the United States, something Europe has already introduced via its General Data Protection Regulation.  \u201cUsers should always know what data is being collected and what it is being collected for,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the only way to empower users to decide what collection is legitimate and what isn\u2019t.

Not denying his exit, Stamos tweeted that his role at the company did change, but he was still fully engaged with work at Facebook.  Facebook could not be immediately reached for comment.  The New York Times first reported his departure from the company.  Inside Facebook, Stamos had been strongly advocating for investigating and disclosing Russian activity on the social media platform, often to the consternation of top executives, including Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, the newspaper said.  Stamos\u2019 responsibilities were reassigned in December after which Stamos said he would leave the company, the Times said.  Stamos was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his duties because company executives thought his exit would look bad, it said, citing current and former employees.

Malaysia\u2019s Transport Ministry this month overturned a so-called cabotage exemption granted in 2019 by the previous government that allowed the use of non-Malaysian vessels.

Though Facebook has acknowledged a \u201cmajor breach of trust\u201d, the company disputed the results of the probe, Therrien said.  \u201cFacebook\u2019s refusal to act responsibly is deeply troubling given the vast amount of sensitive personal information users have entrusted to this company,\u201d said Therrien.  He said the company refused to voluntarily submit to audits of its privacy policies and practices over the next five years.  \u201cThe stark contradiction between Facebook\u2019s public promises to mend its ways on privacy and its refusal to address the serious problems we\u2019ve identified \u2013 or even acknowledge that it broke the law \u2013 is extremely concerning,\u201d he added.  Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner does not have power to levy financial penalties, but it can seek court orders to force an entity to follow its recommendations.  It could take a year to obtain a court order, Therrien said.  The probe revealed an \u201coverall lack of responsibility\u201d with personal information that means \u201cthere is a high risk that\u201d their data \u201ccould be used in ways that they do not know or suspect, exposing them to potential harms.\u201d  Apart from privacy violations, the investigation highlighted problems with regulating social media.

Frustrated with the lack of global progress because of opposition from the United States where the tech giants are based, some countries like France introduced their own digital tax last year. Such moves triggered threats of retaliation via trade tariffs from Washington.  Italy, Britain and Spain have also either already introduced their own digital taxes or plan to do so.

He parried questions of how much control people have over their data on the world\u2019s largest social media network without a major gaffe, while avoiding being cornered into supporting new government regulation.  The hearings that ended on Wednesday revealed no consensus among U.S. lawmakers about what kind of privacy legislation they might want to pursue, if any, and no timeline for action. As he did on Tuesday before a Senate hearing, Zuckerberg refused during a House of Representatives committee hearing to make any promises to support new legislation or change how the social network does business.  \u201cIt is inevitable that there will need to be some regulation\u201d of internet firms, Zuckerberg said, but he avoided any specifics.  (Full text of Zuckerberg's prepared testimony: bit.ly\/2Hkhr9L)  Although Zuckerberg, 33, had never testified at a congressional hearing before, he succeeded in deflecting questions like a Washington veteran. Forty times the internet mogul told lawmakers he had no answers at hand and would get back to them later. About one in three lawmakers got that response over the two days.  Democratic Representative Debbie Dingell expressed frustration with Zuckerberg\u2019s frequent promises to get back to lawmakers later in writing. \u201cSome things are striking during this conversation,\u201d she said. \u201cAs CEO, you didn\u2019t know some key facts.\u201d  On one point, Zuckerberg undercut his consistent message that Facebook users have control of their data. He said he was among the nearly 87 million people whose personal information was improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. He gave no further details.  His admission that even the company\u2019s tech-savvy founder was unable to protect his own data underscored the problem Facebook has in persuading skeptical lawmakers that users can easily safeguard their own information and that further legislation governing Facebook is unnecessary.  The Cambridge Analytica issue was the reason Zuckerberg was on Capitol Hill, answering questions about how that company - which has counted U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign among its clients - got hold of data about Facebook users.  \u201cHow can consumers have control over their data when Facebook does not have control over the data?\u201d asked Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, at the beginning of Wednesday\u2019s hearing.  Zuckerberg said it would take \u201cmany months\u201d to complete an audit of other apps that might also have improperly gathered or shared users\u2019 data.  \u201cI do imagine that we will find some apps that were either doing something suspicious or misusing people\u2019s data,\u201d he said.  Slideshow ( 12 images )  INEVITABLE REGULATION?  Zuckerberg was unable to answer Dingell, the Michigan congresswoman, when she asked how frequently Facebook used computer code embedded in websites to gather dossiers on virtually everyone online.  In a series of questions on how people can remove data from Facebook, Zuckerberg said the company does \u201ccollect data on people who are not signed up for Facebook, for security purposes.\u201d He had no response when asked how a non-Facebook member could remove information without signing up for the service.  Slideshow ( 12 images )  He also said he was not familiar with what various media reports call \u201cshadow profiles,\u201d collections of data assembled on Facebook users that they have no knowledge of or control over.  Wearing a dark suit and tie and politely prefacing almost every remark with \u201cCongressman\u201d or \u201cCongresswoman,\u201d Zuckerberg appeared even more controlled than he did on Tuesday when he testified before senators. He refrained from cracking jokes and flashed few smiles.  The performance had favorable results. Facebook shares closed up 0.78 percent on Wednesday after rising 4.5 percent Tuesday.

The groups said social media firms are not doing enough to regulate \u201cinfluencers\u201d on their platforms who are hired by companies to promote nicotine products.  No law specifically prevents online tobacco or e-cigarette marketing, but social media firms have policies limiting it. The health groups said in their letter that the use of online personalities creates a \u201cloophole\u201d in those policies and allows \u201crampant marketing\u201d of tobacco and other nicotine products to youth.  Instagram and its parent company, Facebook, are studying the issue \u201cto understand how we can improve,\u201d said spokeswoman Stephanie Otway.  The platforms currently ban brand advertising of tobacco products, Otway said. Their policies require any sponsored \u201cinfluencer\u201d posts that explicitly recommended buying tobacco products be restricted only to people over 18.  But the same restriction would not apply to posts by paid influencers that depict tobacco products favorably without explicitly saying that people should buy them, Otway said.  In making policy for a billion users, the company has to draw lines between advertising, promotional posts and \u201csomeone having an opinion,\u201d Otway said.

In addition, Reuters has identified new examples of Instagram content featuring young people with the IQOS posted in the days since Philip Morris said it had suspended its influencer campaigns.  Several posts under the Instagram account @iqos_egypt over the past week have featured young men and women using the device at bars or cocktail events. Other posts from accounts using the IQOS name in Poland, Armenia, Italy and Iran over the last week also showed young, trendy men and women using the devices.  Other posts emerged over the last week from a photographer who documented an IQOS-sponsored VIP lounge at an April music festival in Colombia.  A representative for an IQOS store in Sarno, Italy, said employees found the recent photos of women using IQOS elsewhere online and reposted them on the store\u2019s Instagram account. A representative of an IQOS-branded Instagram account in Armenia denied being paid by Philip Morris to promote the product.  Other Instagram account owners promoting IQOS did not respond to requests for comment. None of the influencers mentioned in the May 10 Reuters report responded to requests for comment on whether they had been asked to stop posting or remove posts marketing Philip Morris products.  Philip Morris spokesman Ryan Sparrow said the firm had \u201cdirected that there should be no new posts\u201d by influencers. Sparrow did not respond to questions about whether the company had stopped paying influencers or attempted to remove existing posts.  Sparrow said some of the new posts \u201cseem to originate from third parties, not PMI, and in countries where we do not sell IQOS,\u201d noting Eqypt and Iran.  Sparrow defended the suspended marketing campaign as a vital way to inform adult cigarette smokers about safer options. He blasted the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids for \u201ctrying to pressure us ... to effectively block these channels\u201d and \u201cin effect perpetuating the consumption of tobacco in its most harmful form: combustible cigarettes.\u201d  Caroline Renzulli, a spokeswoman for the anti-tobacco campaign, called it \u201claughable\u201d that Philip Morris used social media to market to adults.  Philip Morris International has licensed Altria Group Inc to market the IQOS device in the United States beginning this summer.  Altria, which sells Marlboro cigarettes in the United States, has previously said it has a policy of not advertising on social media. However, an online job posting from the company in March seeks a \u201cdigital marketing specialist\u201d for the \u201cIQOS brand team.\u201d The ideal candidate will develop marketing strategy for \u201ce-commerce, owned websites, social media and influencers.\u201d  Altria spokesman David Sutton said the company has no plans to use social media influencers to market IQOS but did not respond to questions about the job posting mentioning an influencer strategy.

Digital advertising of tobacco products remains a gray area for regulators globally. Tobacco advertising regulations in the United States and elsewhere were written before the rise of social media marketing.  The FDA, however, can exert authority over the digital marketing of new devices it clears for sale. As a condition of allowing Philip Morris to sell the IQOS device, the agency requires the company to provide detailed analyses of the age ranges of consumers it reaches with online marketing.  Philip Morris, through Altria, is also required to submit information on any new U.S. advertising campaigns to the FDA at least 30 days before it plans to launch them.  A global treaty governing tobacco regulations, under the umbrella of the World Health Organization, urges countries worldwide to entirely ban tobacco advertising. A 2018 WHO report about tobacco promotion in entertainment and social media channels acknowledged the challenges of regulating it.  The ability to share posts, it found, has \u201chas blurred the lines between consumer and brand owner.\u201d","186":"Aug 6 (Reuters) -  * FACEBOOK IS LETTING ITS EMPLOYEES WORK FROM HOME UNTIL JUNE 2021 DUE TO THE PANDEMIC - BUSINESS INSIDER Source: bit.ly\/3gBHnP9 Further company coverage:","187":"FILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is displayed on a smartphone in this illustration taken January 6, 2020.

But stablecoins will have to meet the highest regulatory standards and adhere to broader public policy goals,\u201d he said.  Libra\u2019s backers pledged to forge ahead with the project on Monday, shrugging off the defection of seven of its founding members, including major payments firms Visa and Mastercard, amid the regulatory criticism.

REUTERS\/Tom Brenner\/File Photo  Wray\u2019s work as a part of a team of attorneys about five years ago appears to be at odds with the international push by the Justice Department and U.S. allies to allow law enforcement and intelligence agencies to bypass encrypted communications.  Wray himself has been a very public part of that campaign, arguing that finding a way around encryption was key to the fight against terrorism and serious crime.  Only last month, Wray told a cybersecurity conference that internet companies were \u201cincreasingly shielding indispensable information about those threats from any form of lawful access -through warrant-proof encryption.\u201d  Wray\u2019s work for Facebook, which occurred when he was employed as a lawyer for law firm King & Spalding, has not been previously reported.  The FBI said Wray could not comment on the case.  \u201cWhen he was an attorney in private practice, however, the Director represented his clients\u2019 interests and advocated on their behalf,\u201d the agency said in a statement.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  \u201cLike all other lawyers, his duty of loyalty was to his client, and he did not put his personal views ahead of his clients\u2019 interests or allow them to affect the legal work he did for clients. Today, as Director of the FBI, his duty is to act in the best interests of the American people,\u201d it said.

Sparse details about the behind-the-scenes battle were released late Wednesday by Facebook in court filings related to a separate lawsuit against Israeli cyber arms dealer NSO Group.  In that case, being heard in California, Facebook has accused NSO of hacking its users through a now-fixed flaw in WhatsApp. NSO denies wrongdoing in that case.  The newly released documents argue that King & Spalding should not be allowed to represent NSO because the firm\u2019s past representation of WhatsApp \u201cnecessarily involved the provision and exchange of WhatsApp\u2019s highly confidential information.\u201d  The documents do not specify what the past representation entailed - saying only that it occurred as WhatsApp was implementing its encryption protections and involved the government.

Facebook stripped the pages of domestic and foreign news outlets for Australians and blocked users of its platform from sharing any news content on Thursday, saying it had been left with no choice ahead of the new content laws.  The move, which also erased several state government and emergency department accounts, as well as nonprofit charity sites, caused widespread outrage.  Morrison, who blasted Facebook on its own platform for \u201cunfriending\u201d Australia, said on Friday the leaders of Britain, Canada, France and India had shown support.  \u201cThere is a lot of world interest in what Australia is doing,\u201d Morrison told reporters in Sydney.  \u201cThat is why I invite ... Facebook to constructively engage because they know that what Australia will do here is likely to be followed by many other Western jurisdictions.\u201d  Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault said late on Thursday his country would adopt the Australian approach as it crafts its own legislation in coming months.  The Australian law, which will force Facebook and Google to reach commercial deals with Australian publishers or face compulsory arbitration, has already been cleared by the federal lower house and is expected to be passed by the Senate within the next week.  Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said he had spoken to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for a second time following the news blackout.  \u201cWe talked through their remaining issues and agreed our respective teams would work through them immediately.

In its statement announcing the move in Australia, Facebook said the Australian law \u201cmisunderstood\u201d its value to publishers. Frydenberg earlier told the Australian Broadcasting Corp that \u201cthere is something much bigger here at stake than just one or two commercial deals. This is about Australia\u2019s sovereignty\u201d.  Facebook and Alphabet Inc owned Google had campaigned together against the laws with both threatening to withdraw key services from Australia if the laws took effect.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Global policymakers have raised alarm over Facebook Inc's FB.O plan to issue Libra, concerned that the tech giant's ambitions for a new global cryptocurrency may weaken their control over monetary and banking policies.  \u201cIf Libra becomes more widely used than the sovereign currency of a particular country, the effect of monetary policy may be severely undermined,\u201d said Hiromi Yamaoka, former head of the BOJ\u2019s division overseeing payment and settlement systems.  While Yamaoka did not say whether he thought Libra would succeed as a cryptocurrency or not, he said its adoption could trigger or accelerate capital flight in countries where market trust in their currencies is low, as it gives users an easy way to move money out.  \u201cIt won\u2019t be a big problem for countries that enjoy strong market trust in their currencies,\u201d Yamaoka said.  \u201cStill, the emergence of Libra would pressure policymakers to discipline themselves,\u201d and ensure they don\u2019t take measures that undermine the value of their currencies, he told Reuters.  Currently a board member at IT consulting firm Future Corp, Yamaoka oversaw the BOJ\u2019s research into digital currencies and is well versed in cryptocurrencies.  Under Facebook\u2019s plan, Libra would be backed by a reserve of real assets such as bank deposits and short-term government securities that would be denominated in major currencies.  Any change in the composition of assets could move markets, including exchange rates, which are a source of concern for policymakers as it encroaches on currency policy, Yamaoka said.  Policymakers must coordinate regulation globally given such new payment tools allow money to cross borders easily, he said.  \u201cAny inconsistency in rules among countries creates a loophole that renders the rules ineffective,\u201d Yamaoka said.  The G7 finance ministers and central bankers warned last month that digital currencies such as Libra raise serious concerns and must be regulated as tightly as possible to ensure they do not upset the world\u2019s financial system.  Despite concerns over money laundering and privacy protection, prohibiting the launch of Libra altogether would be difficult and counter-productive, he said.  \u201cIt might be difficult for Facebook to launch Libra in the first half of 2020, as initially scheduled. But it\u2019s easy for other operators to create something similar,\u201d he said.  \u201cThere\u2019s no way to stop innovation.\u201d","196":"FILE PHOTO: A 3D printed Whatsapp logo is seen in front of a displayed Whatsapp logo in this illustration September 14, 2017.

REUTERS\/Florence Lo\/Illustration  Central banks around the world began looking closely at their own digital currencies, known as CBDCs, after Facebook last year unveiled its yet-to-be-launched Libra stablecoin.  Guiding their research is the question of who will control money in the future, with many fearing the loss of control over payment systems if privately issued currencies such as Libra become widely adopted.  In a report, the IMF said the economic and policy consequences of CBDCs and Big Tech-issued stablecoins depends on adoption - something hard to predict, with CBDCs still far from a reality in major economies and the fate of Libra unclear.  CBDCs and stablecoins could raise pressure for \u201ccurrency substitution,\u201d where foreign currencies displace domestic currencies for local use, it said.  Currency substitution can erode authorities\u2019 control over domestic liquidity, reducing the stability of money demand and potentially weakening the impact of monetary policy.  Without adequate safeguards, foreign CBDCs and stablecoins could also boost illicit flows and make it harder for local authorities to enforce checks on capital movement, it added.  Still, the benefits of CBDCs and stablecoins for cross-border transactions are \u201cconceptually clear\u201d but as yet hard to quantify, the report said, citing lower transaction costs and the chance for financial services to leverage transaction data.  CBDC projects have switched into higher gear in the past year, though most are still at an early stage. China, ahead of other major economies in experimenting with CBDCs, on Sunday completed its largest trial to date.  Issuing CBDCs may also help currencies to internationalise or achieve reserve currency status, the IMF said.  China has publicly said it aims to become the first to issue one to reduce its dependence on the global dollar payment system, sparking concerns from Japan that it was seeking first-mover advantage.","199":"FILE PHOTO: A 3D printed Facebook logo is placed between small toy people figures in front of a keyboard in this illustration taken April 12, 2020.

[nL4N2FY08M]  WHAT DOES THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION SAY?  * The draft law states that Australian news outlets can negotiate individually or collectively with Facebook and Google over payment for content used on the tech firms\u2019 sites. Other tech firms may be added if they are deemed big enough.  * If the parties cannot reach an agreement, an arbitrator will decide whose offer is more reasonable. If Facebook or Google break any resulting agreements, they can be fined up to A$10 million ($7.4 million) in civil penalties.  * The draft also requires tech firms give media outlets notice when they change search algorithms in a way affecting the order in which content appears. They must also share their use of consumer data extracted from news content on their sites.  * The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission began investigating \u201cbig tech\u201d in 2017 and sought feedback on the draft until Aug. 28. It now hopes to work with government and industry to redraft the law before it goes before parliament.  * While internet and media companies have battled in other jurisdictions - notably in Germany over copyright of news snippets and other items published by Google - Australia\u2019s proposal represents the most expansive reform.  WHY WAS THE LAW PROPOSED?  * In recent years, traditional media companies operating in Australia have suffered huge hits to income streams, such as subscriptions and advertising. For every A$100 spent on online advertising in Australia, excluding classifieds, nearly a third goes to Google and Facebook, the competition regulator has said.  * Last year, the regulator published a report stating news outlets lacked bargaining power when negotiating with digital firms over compensation for content posted on online platforms. It said this was a problem because those same publishers relied on Facebook and Google to reach many of their consumers.  * The government wanted the tech giants to abide by a voluntary code. Citing lack of progress in discussions, it decided earlier this year that legislation was necessary.  WHAT HAS THE RESPONSE BEEN?  * The local arm of News Corp NWSA.O is a vocal supporter of the legislation. It partly blamed the tech companies for the closure of dozens of mastheads earlier this year.  * Facebook and Google said they help connect media outlets with consumers, boosting their subscriptions and enabling them to charge advertisers more. Facebook said in the first five months of 2020 it sent 2.3 billion \u201cclicks\u201d worth about A$200 million to Australian news websites via articles appearing on Facebook users\u2019 pages. Google has said it would pay for content, though no major media organisation has agreed to its terms.  * Australia has previously engaged in lengthy battles with major corporations. In 2012, the then centre-left government became the first in the world to prohibit cigarette companies from using designs on their packaging to attract consumers. Tobacco companies mounted legal challenges but the courts ultimately upheld the law.  ($1 = 1.3501 Australian dollars)","201":"SENSITIVE MATERIAL.

The funders said in a statement that Facebook had granted the 83 scholars selected for the project access to \u201conly a portion of what they were told they could expect,\u201d which made it impossible for some to carry out their research. They have given Facebook until Sept. 30 to provide the data.  Their concerns focus on the absence of data that would show which web pages were shared on Facebook as far back as January 2017.  The company had yet to say when the data would be made available, the funders added.  Facebook said in a statement that it remained committed to the project and would \u201ccontinue to provide access to data and tooling to all grant recipients - current and future.\u201d  The announcement comes only a few months after Facebook launched the research program, which opened the company\u2019s proprietary data to independent scholars for the first time.  Data access was meant to be heavily controlled, with special precautions to protect user privacy.  The funding consortium includes both the conservative Charles Koch Foundation and Silicon Valley\u2019s Omidyar Network.  \u201cWe hope Facebook (not to mention other platform companies) will find a way to provide deeply robust privacy-protected data,\u201d they said, as \u201cindependent scholarly analysis of social media platforms is essential\u201d to understanding elections and democracy around the world.","204":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook Inc FB.O will allow users in the United States and Canada to transfer photos and videos to a rival tech platform for the first time - a step that could assuage antitrust concerns by giving users an option to easily leave the company's services, the social media network said on Thursday.  FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen placed on a keyboard in this illustration taken March 25, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  The tool lets Facebook users transfer data stored on its servers directly to another photo storage service, in this case Google Photos - a feature known as data portability.  U.S. and Canadian users will be able to access the tool through their Facebook accounts starting Thursday. The function has already been launched in several countries including in Europe and Latin America.  It allows the social media company to give users more control over their data and respond to U.S. regulators and lawmakers who are investigating its competitive practices and allegations it has stifled competition.  The U.S. launch also comes ahead of a hearing set up by the Federal Trade Commission on Sept. 22 to examine the potential benefits and challenges of data portability. Control of data that hurts competition has become a critical topic in the antitrust debate in the United States and Europe.  Facebook\u2019s Director of Privacy and Public Policy Steve Satterfield said over the past couple of years, the company heard calls from policymakers and regulators asking it to facilitate choice, make it easier for people to choose new providers and move their data to new services.  \u201cSo it really is an important part of the response to the kinds of concerns that drive antitrust regulation or competition regulation,\u201d Satterfield told Reuters in an interview.  He said the company would be open to participating in the FTC hearing if the agency approaches them.  Data portability is a requirement under Europe\u2019s privacy law called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California\u2019s privacy law called the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).  Also, Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Mark Warner of Virginia along with Republican senator Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a bill, known as the ACCESS Act, in October, which requires large tech platforms to let their users easily move their data to other services.  Satterfield said Facebook hopes to eventually allow users to move key data such as their contacts, friend lists etc onto another platform in a way that protects user privacy.  Facebook developed its data portability tool as a member of the Data Transfer Project - which was formed to allow web users to easily move their data between online service providers whenever they want - and counts Facebook, Alphabet's GOOGL.O Google, Microsoft MSFT.O, Twitter TWTR.N and Apple AAPL.O among its contributors.  Members of the project are also looking at letting users transfer data such as emails, playlists and events in the future, the company said.  On a call with academics and policy experts from the fields of competition and privacy on Wednesday, Facebook said it is moving deliberately on data transfer partnerships with third-parties to avoid a repeat of the Cambridge Analytica incident.  The now defunct British political consulting firm harvested the personal data of millions of Facebook users without their consent and used it for political advertising.","205":"SAN FRANCISCO, June 4 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc will start labeling Russian, Chinese and other state-controlled media organizations, and later this summer block any ads from such outlets that target U.S. users, it said on Thursday.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  \u201cFacebook\u2019s insular boardroom must be cracked open because the company has no accountability to its users, its investors, or our democracy,\u201d said New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer in an e-mailed statement.  In a separate statement, Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs said that \u201cFacebook\u2019s independent investors agree that it\u2019s time for the company to separate the Board Chair and CEO roles. Right now, Mr. Zuckerberg is both Board Chair and CEO, serving as his own boss, and clearly it\u2019s not working.\u201d  A Facebook representative declined to comment on the remarks, or on similar comments made by the treasurers of Connecticut, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania.  The company is under pressure from investors over data privacy issues and its role in elections, which have attracted scrutiny from regulators.  Stringer and Frerichs oversee pension funds that hold Facebook shares and were among a group of investors who filed a shareholder resolution calling for Facebook to have an independent chair as a way to improve oversight.  Facebook opposed the idea at its annual meeting held last week, saying its lead independent director already can represent all stockholder interests.  The reform was never likely to pass, because Zuckerberg and other insiders control 58 percent of Facebook\u2019s voting power through a special class of shares carrying 10 times the voting power of standard shares.  But voting results from the meeting released late on Monday showed that excluding the roughly 4 billion shares held by Zuckerberg and other insiders, the measure calling for an independent chair would have received support from 68 percent of outside investors.  That was significantly higher than the 51 percent support from outside investors that a similar measure drew in 2017, sponsors said. At a traditional company without the special share class, this year\u2019s result would typically lead to changes.  Monday\u2019s tallies also indicated a majority of outside investors voted against Facebook\u2019s recommendations on other questions including on proposals to revamp the company\u2019s voting rules and on how frequently to vote on the pay of Zuckerberg and other top leaders.","207":"Feb 8 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc said Monday it will help users find out where and when they can receive the coronavirus vaccine and will expand a list of false health claims it bans from the platform.

But seafood has been good to him.  Hawking dried shrimp, squid and fish in nightly Facebook livestreams, Anurak, who is quick with a joke and adept at interacting with customers, can draw up to 300,000 viewers at a time.  He\u2019s backed by a team who help respond to orders, answer questions on Facebook Messenger, monitor payments to his bank account and shout out tag lines off camera for comedic effect.  The formula works so well, Anurak says he made 26 million baht ($829,000) in sales in March alone.  \u201cFacebook and Instagram give people an opportunity. If you do it right with good content, in just seven months you can make millions,\u201d he told Reuters from the seaside village of Satun.  His success is emblematic of booming social media commerce in Thailand where entrepreneurs sell products directly to customers via Facebook, Instagram and messaging apps like Japan\u2019s Line Corp.  Propelled by upgrades to mobile banking apps, sales via social media in Thailand more than doubled to 334.2 billion baht ($10.9 billion) in 2017, according to the latest report from the country\u2019s Electronic Transaction Development Agency.  Moreover, those sales accounted for 44% of e-commerce in Southeast Asia\u2019s second-biggest economy, jumping from 21% a year earlier. Since then, banks have dropped transfer fees, likely driving the market further.  The popularity of so-called social commerce in Thailand owes much to the relatively late arrival of big e-commerce firms, cultural shopping preferences and the wide use of Facebook and Instagram. Some 38 million people or 57% of the population access Facebook every day, according to the U.S. firm.  Its growth also highlights the global business opportunities for Facebook and its Instagram unit.  \u201cSocial commerce is a market to monitor because Facebook has moved more sharply in a commerce direction recently with the launch of many commerce friendly features,\u201d said Alessandro Psicini, co-founder of Crea which advises brands that want to boost their social media sales in Thailand.  Facebook said this month it wanted to expand into payments and launch its own coin. Instagram in March introduced a checkout button which allows users to shop without leaving the app, though that function is currently limited to a small number of brands and U.S. consumers.  Facebook and Instagram declined to comment on how they plan to make the most of social commerce opportunities.  CUSTOMERS FIRST  Within Asia, only Indonesia rivals Thailand in social commerce. There it accounts for about 40% of e-commerce but is worth a smaller $3 billion, says consulting firm McKinsey & Company. The market is less developed as many Indonesians do not have bank accounts and due to the challenges of delivering goods across the country\u2019s archipelago.  In other parts of Asia, shopping on big e-commerce platforms like China\u2019s Alibaba, Amazon.com\u2019s Japan unit or Walmart\u2019s Indian unit Flipkart is the norm, although selling via social media is on the rise in some countries.  Livestreaming by merchants has gained in popularity in China while in India, social commerce companies have emerged over the past year. Satish Meena, senior analyst at Forrester Research, says the firm\u2019s preliminary estimates put India\u2019s annual social selling revenue at $100-$150 million.  Completing a sale via social media can be cumbersome.  In Thailand, customers find products on Facebook or Instagram, while chats and payments usually take place on different apps. But for many Thais, the appeal of social media shopping is the direct communication with merchants.  Chonticha Srisawang, 35, who has her own brand of fake eyelashes and over 76,000 followers on her Instagram, prang_bohktoh, says customers became comfortable placing orders after she took the time to answer queries on chat app Line.  \u201cThe Thai market is very customer-centric,\u201d said Vilaiporn Taweelappontong, partner at PwC Thailand, adding that Thai shoppers love to browse and share, which favours social media over big online shopping malls.  \u201cMerchants do everything to ensure customers have a good experience. In the U.S and Europe there is more standardisation and there are fewer choices because the emphasis is on the back-end and things moving faster.\u201d  The two biggest online malls in Thailand are now seeeking to win over social media merchants - who industry experts estimate number more than a hundred thousand. Both added livestreaming services last year.  Alibaba\u2019s Lazada, which launched in Thailand in 2012, also started an invitation-only programme in August to bring social media sellers with a broad customer base onto its site. Around 300 merchants have since joined.  Sea Ltd in March raised $1.5 billion, part of which will go towards educating merchants on how to best use its Shopee platform, which debuted in Thailand in 2015.  Some merchants, however, are not convinced.  Patchararak Thanasintrakul, who sells swimwear on Instagram account Swimsaic, is hesitant due to concerns about copycats and potential pressure to discount.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been thinking about it. Lazada approached us, but we worry about brand image. Lazada likes to support discounts, but our brand has never done discounts,\u201d she said.  A Lazada spokeswoman said the company does not compel its merchants to discount.","210":"* World stock index little changed after hitting 4-month high  * Zuckerberg loses $16 bln in record Facebook fall  * U.S. agrees to refrain from car tariffs on EU for now (Adds oil gains, strategist quote)  NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - World stock markets struggled to hold on to four-month highs on Thursday as a record sell-off in shares of Facebook Inc offset optimism that the European Union and the United States would settle their differences on trade.  Facebook Inc, the fifth-largest global stock by market capitalization, collapsed 18.89 percent, set for the biggest one-day wipeout in U.S. stock market history, after the social media company\u2019s earnings report showed slowing usage in the biggest advertising markets. Executives warned profits would plummet as the company improves privacy safeguards.  That countered optimism over news that U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to refrain from imposing car tariffs while Europe and the U.S. negotiated to cut other trade barriers.  MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.01 percent after earlier rising to the highest level since March 16.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 100.35 points, or 0.39 percent, to 25,514.45, the S&P 500 lost 8.65 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,837.42 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 83.64 points, or 1.05 percent, to 7,848.60.  The dollar index rose 0.28 percent.  Liz Young, senior investment strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management, said investor skepticism of the market\u2019s run is leading people to take a close look at corporate earnings and other fundamental factors \u201crather than jumping on the bandwagon and investing in tech stocks.\u201d  \u201cPeople need to be careful right now to be in those trendy trades,\u201d she said.  The heat has eased somewhat over U.S. and European trade issues, allowing markets to return their attention to central banks and their plans to withdraw stimulus.  \u201cThe lifting of the threat of tariffs on the auto sector in particular is a major development,\u201d said Royal Bank of Canada European economist Cathal Kennedy.  The euro, which initially received the U.S.-EU trade news warmly, sharply lost ground after European Central Bank boss Mario Draghi reaffirmed a commitment to keep interest rates on hold \u201cthrough\u201d next summer, even though he saw inflation picking up by the end of the year.  The euro was last down 0.59 percent to $1.1659.  Concerns about Facebook\u2019s major earnings miss in an otherwise largely positive U.S. corporate results season did little to support bonds, which lost value as yields resumed their climb higher.  Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 8\/32 in price to yield 2.9653 percent, from 2.936 percent late on Wednesday.  Progress on trade also helped demand for oil, which is sensitive to economic growth prospects. Crude prices were also helped as Saudi Arabia suspended oil shipments through a strait in the Red Sea after an attack by Yemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi movement.  U.S. crude rose 0.51 percent to $69.65 per barrel and Brent was last at $74.37, up 0.6 percent on the day.  Trade is by no means removed from a slate of issues facing investors, with the U.S. still to finalize an agreement with Europe, while it remains in negotiations with China as well as with Canada and Mexico.  China\u2019s blue-chip shares lost 1.1 percent. Qualcomm Inc dropped its $44 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors after a deadline for securing Chinese regulatory approval passed.  The breakdown of the deal leaves \u201cinvestors fearing that the trade war has just turned even more so on China,\u201d Citi analysts told clients.","211":"Dec 19 (Reuters) - Social media influencers will be banned from promoting vaping, tobacco products and weapons on Instagram as the Facebook-owned platform doubles down on its existing ban on companies advertising these products.

One in five girls and young women has abandoned or cut down on using a social media platform after being targeted, with some saying harassment started when they were as young as eight, the survey by girls\u2019 rights group Plan International showed.  \u201cGirls are being silenced by a toxic level of harassment,\u201d said the organisation\u2019s chief executive, Anne-Birgitte Albrectsen.  Attacks were most common on Facebook, where 39% of girls polled said they had been harassed, followed by Instagram (23%), WhatsApp (14%), Snapchat (10%), Twitter (9%) and TikTok (6%).  The charity, which will share the report with social media companies and lawmakers around the world, said the abuse was suppressing girls\u2019 voices at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic was increasing the importance of communicating online.  It called on social media companies to take urgent action to address the issue and urged governments to pass laws to deal with online harassment.  The study found reporting tools were ineffective in stopping the abuse, which included explicit messages, pornographic photos and cyberstalking.  Nearly half of girls targeted had been threatened with physical or sexual violence, according to the poll. Many said the abuse took a mental toll, and a quarter felt physically unsafe.  \u201cIt is time for this to stop. Girls should not have to put up with behaviour online which would be criminal on the streets,\u201d the report said.  Facebook and Instagram said they used artificial intelligence to look for bullying content, constantly monitored users\u2019 reports of abuse and always removed rape threats.  \u201cKeeping women safe on our apps is critical and we invest heavily in keeping abuse off our platforms,\u201d said Cindy Southworth, head of women\u2019s safety at Facebook.  She said Facebook was working with Plan International to better understand how it can support young women around the world.  Twitter said it also used technology to catch abusive content and has launched tools to improve users\u2019 control over their conversations.  The survey polled 14,000 girls and young women aged 15 to 25 in 22 countries including Brazil, India, Nigeria, Spain, Thailand and the United States.  Albrectsen said activists, including those campaigning for gender equality and on LGBT+ issues, were often targeted particularly viciously, and their lives and families threatened.  \u201cDriving girls out of online spaces is hugely disempowering in an increasingly digital world, and damages their ability to be seen, heard and become leaders,\u201d she added.  In an open letter to Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Twitter, girls from around the world called on social media companies to create more effective ways to report abuse.  \u201cWe use (your platforms) not just to connect with friends, but to lead and create change. But they are not safe for us. We get harassed and abused on them. Every. Single. Day,\u201d they wrote.  \u201cAs this global pandemic moves our lives online, we are more at risk than ever.\u201d  Plan International also urged the companies to do more to hold to account those behind such abuse, and to collect data on the scale of the problem.

U.S. lawmakers demanded Zuckerberg personally testify in Washington to explain his company\u2019s actions.  Meanwhile, advertisers Mozilla and Commerzbank suspended ads on the service and the hashtag #DeleteFacebook remained popular online, although it was hard to tell how many users are abandoning Facebook.  In light of those concerns, investors continued to sell off Facebook shares, although not at the pace of earlier in the week. They closed on Thursday at $164.89, down 2.7 percent. The S&P 500 Index was down 2.5 percent on the day. Facebook shares closed at $185.09 on Friday.  The company has lost more than $50 billion in market value since allegations this week that Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed data to build profiles on American voters and influence the 2016 presidential election.  Five days after the scandal broke, Zuckerberg apologized on Wednesday for mistakes his company made and promised to restrict developers\u2019 access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy.  On Thursday, Facebook executives were still saying sorry.  \u201cWe know this is an issue of trust. We know this is a critical moment for our company, for the service we provide,\u201d Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said in an interview broadcast on CNBC.  Zuckerberg\u2019s apology and promises were not enough to ease political pressure on the world\u2019s largest social media company.  \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be for a company to decide what is the appropriate balance between privacy and innovation and use of data. Those rules should be set by society as a whole and so by parliament,\u201d British minister for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Matt Hancock, told BBC Radio.  Zuckerberg\u2019s media rounds did little to satisfy Washington lawmakers in either political party who have demanded this week that the 33-year-old billionaire testify before Congress.  The Republican chairman and top Democrat of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee said they will in coming days formally ask Zuckerberg to testify.  The request came a day after company executives briefed committee aides for nearly two hours and left with a list of at least 60 questions they were unable to answer, two aides said.  Zuckerberg said in media interviews on Thursday he would be willing to testify if he is the right person at the company to speak to lawmakers.  \u201cMy message to Mark Zuckerberg is you are right person. There\u2019s no question you are the right person,\u201d Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, told reporters after Facebook executives briefed Senate staff on Thursday.  Facebook said it had no comment beyond what Zuckerberg had already said.  Executives also briefed another House committee on Thursday, and while they answered questions about Cambridge Analytica they were unprepared to address broader questions about Facebook\u2019s privacy policies, according to a staffer who was present.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  REPUTATIONAL COSTS  Wall Street analysts expressed relief that there were no signs so far of a fundamental shift in the company\u2019s advertising-driven revenue model, but some said there would be costs to shore up its reputation.  Facebook, with more than 2 billion monthly active users, made almost all its $40.6 billion in revenue last year from advertising.  Sandberg said Facebook\u2019s priority was restoring users\u2019 trust, even if that meant accepting regulation of the data that is central to its ad business, and she said the company was \u201cmassively ramping hiring.\u201d  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Several analysts cut price targets. Technology stocks have fallen along with Facebook this week as investors worried about tighter scrutiny of global platforms like Alphabet\u2019s Google, Twitter and Snapchat.  Analysts said Zuckerberg\u2019s promises to investigate thousands of apps, and to give members a tool that lets them turn off access, would not substantially reduce advertisers\u2019 ability to use Facebook data - the company\u2019s lifeblood.  Nevertheless, open-source browser and app developer Mozilla said it was \u201cpressing pause\u201d on its Facebook advertising after the revelations prompted it to take a closer look at the site\u2019s default privacy settings.  \u201cWe found that its current default settings leave access open to a lot of data \u2013 particularly with respect to settings for third-party apps,\u201d Mozilla said in a blog post.  British advertising group ISBA, which represents thousands of brands, threatened to withdraw ads if investigations show data has been misused.  \u201cWe think this issue is more likely to snowball than recede and that advertisers are reaching a tipping point at which spending on not only Facebook and other online platforms, is re-evaluated,\u201d brokerage Liberum said in a note.  But Sharon Rowlands, president of USA Today Network Marketing Solutions, said it was unlikely a flood of brands would stop advertising on Facebook because of its powerful targeting tools.  \u201cThe challenge is that the platform performs,\u201d Rowlands said.","214":"(Reuters) - Twitter Inc said on Friday it will remove tweets calling for people to interfere with the U.S. election process or implementation of election results, including through violence, as the company also announced more restrictions to slow the spread of misinformation.

Twitter says it has labeled thousands of misleading posts, though most attention has been on the labels applied to tweets by U.S. President Donald Trump.

The company announced several temporary steps to slow amplification of content: for example, from Oct. 20 to at least the end of the U.S. election week, global users pressing \u201cretweet\u201d will be directed first to the \u201cquote tweet\u201d button to encourage people to add their own commentary.  It will also stop surfacing trending topics without added context, and will stop people seeing \u201cliked by\u201d recommendations from people they do not know in their timeline.  Twitter\u2019s decision to hit the brakes on automated recommendations contrasts with the approach at Facebook Inc , which is amping up promotion of its groups product despite concerns about extremism in those spaces.  Social media companies are under pressure to combat election-related misinformation and prepare for the possibility of violence or poll place intimidation around the Nov. 3 vote.  Reuters has reported that Republicans are mobilizing thousands of volunteers to watch early voting sites and ballot drop boxes to find evidence to back up Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated complaints about widespread voter fraud.

Facebook, under pressure to curb such misinformation on its platform, has made amplifying credible health information a key element of its response.

The company said this coordination could be technical - for example, an individual operating multiple accounts to tweet the same message - or social, such as using a messaging app to organize many people to tweet at the same time.  Twitter said it prohibits all forms of technical coordination, but for social coordination to break its rules, there must be evidence of physical or psychological harm, or \u2018informational\u2019 harm caused by false or misleading content.","218":"FILE PHOTO: The Facebook logo is displayed on a mobile phone in this picture illustration taken December 2, 2019.

The antitrust complaint from 46 states, the District of Columbia and Guam was assigned to Judge James E. Boasberg who has been on the court since 2011, while the FTC complaint was assigned to Judge Christopher Cooper, who has been on the court since 2014.  The complaints accuse Facebook of using a \u201cbuy or bury\u201d strategy to snap up rivals and keep smaller competitors at bay. They focus specifically on its acquisitions of photo-sharing app Instagram and messaging app WhatsApp in 2014 and could force Facebook to divest the two former rivals.  Facebook called the lawsuits \u201crevisionist history\u201d and said antitrust laws do not exist to punish \u201csuccessful companies.\u201d  Lawyers for the states suing identified two related cases -- one filed in January by some small tech companies and one last week filed by Facebook users.

The social media company said in a blog post it was increasing the types of false claims about the coronavirus, its vaccine and other vaccines that it will remove, including that COVID-19 is a man-made virus, and that vaccines are dangerous. Such claims are already prohibited in ads on the platform.  Facebook said it would remove groups, pages and accounts that repeatedly share the debunked claims.  The company has introduced more stringent policies to combat COVID-19 vaccine misinformation during the pandemic, but has had a more hands-off approach to misinformation about other vaccines, which has rarely been removed and only when it was considered to risk \u201cimminent harm\u201d.  In December, Facebook announced it would remove false claims about COVID-19 vaccines that had been debunked by public health experts, though in recent weeks news reports have identified Facebook pages, groups and Instagram accounts still spreading these false claims.

As of Jan. 31, the date of its most recent detailed filings, the Global Allocation Fund held 1.38 million Facebook shares, making it the No. 16 equity holding valued at about $258 million at that time.  Facebook shares are down more than 10 percent after the New York Times and London\u2019s Observer newspaper reported in mid-March that Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that worked on U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, gained inappropriate access to data on tens of millions of the social media company\u2019s users.

Facebook is the seventh largest U.S. equity short at $5.22 billion with short interest increasing by $447 million in April and $1.11 billion for the year, according to S3 Partners.

Facebook has 54 fact-checking partners working in 42 languages, but the program on Instagram is only being rolled out in the United States.  \u201cThis is an initial step as we work toward a more comprehensive approach to tackling misinformation,\u201d said Stephanie Otway, a Facebook company spokeswoman.  Instagram has largely been spared the scrutiny associated with its parent company, which is in the crosshairs of regulators over alleged Russian attempts to spread misinformation around the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  But an independent report commissioned by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence found that it was \u201cperhaps the most effective platform\u201d for Russian actors trying to spread false information since the election.  Russian operatives appeared to shift much of their activity to Instagram, where engagement outperformed Facebook, wrote researchers at New Knowledge, which conducted the analysis.  \u201cOur assessment is that Instagram is likely to be a key battleground on an ongoing basis,\u201d they said.  It has also come under pressure to block health hoaxes, including posts trying to dissuade people from getting vaccinated.  Last month, UK-based charity Full Fact, one of Facebook\u2019s fact-checking partners, called on the company to provide more data on how flagged content is shared over time, expressing concerns over the effectiveness of the program.","231":"FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed Facebook like button is seen in front of the Facebook logo, in this illustration taken October 25, 2017.

She also said that attacks like those on Facebook also made it more difficult to recruit candidates for public office because \u201cwhy would you subject yourself to that.\u201d  Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Pelosi\u2019s remarks.  NetChoice, an e-commerce trade group that includes Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, issued a statement objecting to Pelosi\u2019s criticism.  \u201cHyperbolic attacks on platforms won\u2019t help solve the tech issues of today,\u201d Carl Szabo, vice president of the group, said in the statement. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that Facebook is hugely invested in ensuring that its platform won\u2019t be misused to aid election interference.\u201d  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The video of Pelosi was slowed to make her speech seem slurred and edited to make it appear she repeatedly stumbled over her words.  President Donald Trump retweeted the video last week, writing: \u201cPELOSI STAMMERS THROUGH NEWS CONFERENCE.\u201d He later told a reporter the House speaker, who is 79, had \u201clost it.\u201d  The Washington Post reported last week that YouTube, which is owned by Google, responded by removing the video because it violated company policies on acceptable content. The Post said Twitter did not comment, but Facebook declined to remove the videos, even after its independent fact-checkers deemed the content false.  \u201cWe don\u2019t have a policy that stipulates that the information you post on Facebook must be true,\u201d the Post quoted Facebook as saying in a statement.  U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller charged 13 Russian individuals and three Russian entities with conspiracy to defraud the United States, among other charges, as part of his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election that included widespread use of social media sites to spread misinformation.  Facebook has been criticized over its content policies by politicians from across the spectrum. Republican senators have accused it of discriminating against conservative viewpoints and suppressing free speech, suggesting antitrust action could fix the situation.  Facebook, along with Twitter and Google, has denied its platform is politically biased.","233":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc FB.O beat analysts' estimates for quarterly revenue on Wednesday and said it has seen \"signs of stability\" for sales in April after a plunge in March, in yet another signal that tech giants may weather the coronavirus-induced economic collapse better than other sectors.  FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen placed on a keyboard in this illustration taken March 25, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  The announcement came a day after Alphabet's GOOGL.O Google said a drop in its online ad sales similarly steadied in April. Shares of Facebook, the world's biggest social network and the owner of WhatsApp and Instagram, soared 9% in extended trading.  Facebook said advertising revenue was roughly flat in the first three weeks of April compared with the same period last year, a tentative early sign of recovery following a \u201csteep decrease\u201d in revenue in March as lockdowns took effect worldwide to slow the spread of the virus.  Revenue growth was 18% in the first quarter, Facebook\u2019s slowest ever by a wide margin, although it beat analysts\u2019 expectations for growth of 16%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Ad sales, which make up nearly all of Facebook\u2019s revenue, rose 17% to $17.44 billion.  Some businesses took advantage of bargain pricing to run a heavier volume of ads after the pandemic wiped out Facebook ad pricing over the course of the quarter, contributing to a 39% increase in total ad impressions, executives said.  Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg told analysts the company saw an increase in gaming ads and steady spending from technology and e-commerce players, which offset \u201csignificant declines\u201d in ads from the hard-hit travel and auto sectors.  GLOOMY OUTLOOK  Even so, analysts have a gloomy outlook for Facebook\u2019s second quarter, with advertisers across industries slashing marketing budgets in response to virus-related uncertainty, including many of the small businesses and direct-to-consumer brands that market themselves heavily on Facebook.  Flat revenue in April indicates that the second quarter will be \u201cmore challenging\u201d than the first, said eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson, as countries emerge from lockdown and businesses reopen at varying rates.  The company said around 3 billion users interacted with at least one of its apps each month in the quarter, up from 2.9 billion last quarter, as social networks use surged during coronavirus lockdowns. Some of that engagement is expected to slip once shelter-in-place orders are relaxed, it said.  Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg cautioned against a rush to end lockdowns.  \u201cI worry that re-opening certain places too quickly before infection rates have been reduced to very minimal levels will almost guarantee future outbreaks and worse longer-term health and economic outcomes,\u201d he said.  He struck a markedly different tone from fellow Silicon Valley chief executive Elon Musk, the head of Tesla TSLA.O, who called the lockdowns \"fascist\" on Tesla's earnings call on Wednesday.  KEEP ON BUILDING  Executives said Facebook will move forward with plans to hire 10,000 new employees this year, largely in product and engineering roles, but will pull back on hiring plans for business departments like ad sales.  Facebook lowered its guidance for total expenses in 2020 to $52 billion-$56 billion, down from a prior range of $54 billion-$59 billion, citing the slower headcount growth and savings from canceled travel, events and marketing.  Total costs for the first quarter rose just 1% to $11.84 billion.  Zuckerberg said he accepted that profit margins will decrease this year, but said he was committed to maintaining plans for investment \u201crather than slamming on the brakes now, as I think a lot of companies may.\u201d  He said he aimed to \u201ckeep on building and keep on investing,\u201d particularly to \u201cmake up for some of the stuff that other companies would pull back on,\u201d which in some ways was \u201can opportunity\u201d for Facebook, given its deep cash reserves.  Zuckerberg said he would eventually plan to moderate expenses over time, noting that the company\u2019s strong finances amid the economic pullback \u201chas certainly reinforced for me the importance of maintaining high margins.\u201d","234":"(Raw quotes from officials, media publishers, NGOs and the public in a breaking news situation)  SYDNEY, Feb 18 (Reuters) - The following are reactions from academics, politicians and NGOs after Facebook Inc blocked all Australian media content including official information on coronavirus, wildfires and other important services in an escalating dispute over paying for content.

Netflix will reduce traffic over Indian telecom networks by 25% over the next 30 days, the company said in a statement, following similar moves in Europe to help internet service providers experiencing a surge in usage.

Scott Howe told Reuters in a phone interview that Acxiom, among the largest U.S. data brokers, welcomed change and supported regulation of some kind, although he stopped short of endorsing a specific plan or greater powers for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the primary U.S. regulator of data privacy.  Facebook Inc, which uses personal data to sell targeted ads but does not sell data, caused an uproar last month when it said political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, whose clients have included President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, had wrongly harvested the information of millions of users.  Acxiom and competitors such as Experian PLC were indirectly affected by the Cambridge Analytica scandal when, shortly after it broke, Facebook said it would discontinue one of its advertising tools powered by third-party data in an effort to be more careful about privacy.  Acxiom shares plunged as much as 34 percent the day after Facebook\u2019s announcement on March 28. They have since partially recovered.  \u201cFacebook has done a credit to the entire industry because they brought this back out into the public spotlight,\u201d Howe said.  He said he had traveled to Washington to meet regulators and would continue to do so, and that industry executives were speaking more frequently among themselves about regulations.  \u201cThis isn\u2019t an area that perhaps most companies or most legislators have thought a tremendous amount about,\u201d Howe said.  Data brokers faced the prospect of tougher U.S. oversight in 2014, after the FTC in a report called for legislation that would enable consumers to more easily learn how data brokers use their data, correct it or opt out of the process.  No such legislation passed.  On Thursday, Howe published a list of principles on a corporate blog that he thinks any new legislation should follow. He did not endorse a specific bill.

Reuters Fact Check. REUTERS\/Axel Schmidt  The meme, which has been posted to Facebook on numerous accounts (here, here, here, here ), has been seen by thousands of people, and suggests that face coverings are dangerous.  It reads: \u201cMask wearers are now arriving in ICU with antibiotic resistant strains of pneumonia from breathing in the pathogenic organisms they were meant to exhale.\u201d  This is a false assertion. Firstly, Reuters has been unable to locate any reports of people being admitted to intensive care due to a pneumonia infection that has been directly linked to mask wearing.  Secondly, once relevant pathogens have been inhaled, exhaling them doesn\u2019t mean an infection can be avoided.  Pneumonia, an illness that results in the inflammation of the lungs, can be caused by a number of things, including bacterial infection, a virus such as coronavirus, and a rare fungal infection (bit.ly\/33KWRep).  Reuters has previously debunked claims that masks can cause bacterial and viral infections such a pleurisy and coronavirus, which are linked to pneumonia (here, here) \u2013 and fungal infections, too (here).  Speaking to Reuters specifically about fungal infections, Dr. Thomas Nash, an internist, pulmonologist, and infectious disease specialist at New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York City, said: \u201cThe only thing that hits the mask is what you breathe out,\u201d as he explained that healthy people \u201cdon\u2019t exhale fungus.\u201d  He added that someone who already has a fungal infection in their lungs could possibly contaminate their own mask, but not the other way around.  A global team of public health experts at Learnaboutcovid19 also told Reuters there was \u201cno evidence\u201d to suggest face masks can increase the chance of developing pneumonia, \u201cor any other bacterial, fungal or viral infection in the lungs\u201d.  The statement added: \u201cIn fact, according to a study published in the Preventive Medicine journal, wearing face masks is shown to protect people against bacterial infections in hospital settings, where health care workers are most prone to antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\u201d  While it is false to say people are developing pneumonia from simply breathing into their own masks, experts have advised people to ensure they regularly clean their non-medial face coverings in order to avoid contamination (here) . The World Health Organisation, for instance, says sweat can make a mask wetter in a shorter amount of time, and can promote the growth of microorganisms (here).  Research into the effectiveness of masks is still relatively sparse but a systematic review of distancing measures, masks and eye protection across 172 studies was published in The Lancet medical journal in June and found that a combination of the three could help to protect against transmission of three diseases caused by coronaviruses \u2013 COVID-19, SARS and MERS (here). The research found that masks, specifically, could have protective benefits, but that more research is necessary (here).  VERDICT  False. There is no evidence of people being admitted to ICUs because of pneumonia strains that have been directly linked to wearing face masks. Neither is there evidence that face masks are causing people to develop pneumonia from breathing in their own recirculated air.

Facebook will also take proactive steps to prevent advertisers from discriminating users based on race, sex and age, ACLU said in a statement.  Since late 2016, Facebook has faced legal pressure related to its ad targeting practices from the ACLU, Outten & Golden LLP, the Communications Workers of America, job seekers and consumers, and fair housing and civil rights organizations.

(Reporting by Akanksha Rana and Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)","242":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc said on Wednesday it would end its partnerships with several large data brokers who help advertisers target people on the social network, a step that follows a scandal over how Facebook handles personal information.  The world\u2019s largest social media company is under pressure to improve its handling of data after disclosing that information about 50 million Facebook users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.  Facebook adjusted the privacy settings on its service on Wednesday, giving users control over their personal information in fewer taps.  Facebook has for years given advertisers the option of targeting their ads based on data collected by companies such as Acxiom Corp and Experian PLC.  The tool has been widely used among certain categories of advertisers - such as automakers, luxury goods producers and consumer packaged goods companies - who do not sell directly to consumers and have relatively little information about who their customers are, according to Facebook.  \u201cWhile this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people\u2019s privacy on Facebook,\u201d Graham Mudd, a Facebook product marketing director, said in a statement.  Shares in Acxiom traded down more than 10 percent to $25 after Facebook\u2019s announcement after the bell. Shares in other data brokers were largely unchanged.  Acxiom said late on Wednesday it did not expect this change to impact its revenue or earnings for the year ending in March. The company currently expects revenue in the range of $910 million to $915 million in the 2018 fiscal year.  However, for the 2019 fiscal year, Acxiom expects total revenue and profitability to be negatively impacted by as much as $25 million.  Facebook declined to comment on how the change could affect its ad revenue.  Advertisers would still be able to use third-party data services to measure how well their ads performed by examining purchasing data, Facebook said.  Facebook\u2019s website lists nine third-party data providers that it has worked with, including Acxiom, Experian, Oracle Data Cloud, TransUnion and WPP PLC.  Other companies, besides Acxiom, were not available for comment.  Figurines are seen in front of the Facebook logo in this illustration taken March 20, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  Facebook on Wednesday also put all its privacy settings on one page and made it easier to stop third-party apps from using personal information. Privacy settings had previously been spread over at least 20 screens, Facebook said.  Facebook said in a blog post it had been working on the updates for some time but sped things up to appease users\u2019 anger over how the company uses data and as lawmakers around the globe call for regulation.  Facebook\u2019s shares closed up 0.5 percent at $153.03 on Wednesday. They are still down more than 17 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled in 2014 via a third-party app to Cambridge Analytica, which was later hired by Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.  The data leak has raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers, who are Facebook\u2019s lifeblood, and lead to tougher regulation.  SCRUTINY FROM LAWMAKERS  Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly apologized for the mistakes the company made and has promised to crack down on abuse of the Facebook platform and restrict developers\u2019 access to user information.  There is a new Facebook page - called Access Your Information - where users can see what they have shared and manage it.  \u201cThe biggest difference is ease of access in settings, which fulfills Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s promise to make the privacy process and permissions more transparent to users,\u201d Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said.  It was uncertain whether the changes will satisfy lawmakers.  They were announced ahead of a stringent European Union data law which comes into force in May. It requires companies to give people a \u201cright to portability\u201d - to take their data with them - and imposes fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for companies breaking the law.  Lawmakers in the United States and Britain are still clamoring for Zuckerberg himself to explain how users\u2019 data ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica.  He plans to testify before Congress, a source briefed on the matter said on Tuesday. Facebook has said it has received invitations to testify and that it is talking to legislators.  Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc have been invited to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy. The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and U.S. Senate Commerce Committee have also asked Zuckerberg to appear at a hearing.

Zuckerberg has drawn a base salary of $1 for the past three years, and his \u201cother\u201d compensation was listed at $22.6 million, most of which was for his personal security.  Nearly $20 million went toward security for Zuckerberg and his family, up from about $9 million the year prior. Zuckerberg also received $2.6 million for personal use of private jets, which the company said was part of his overall security program.  Facebook has in the past few years faced public outcry over its role in Russia\u2019s alleged influence on the 2016 U.S. presidential election and has come under fire following revelations that Cambridge Analytica obtained personal data from millions of Facebook profiles without consent.  Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg took home $23.7 million in 2018 compared to $25.2 million last year.  Separately, Facebook said Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings would vacate his seat on the social media company\u2019s board and not be nominated for re-election.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The acknowledgement came a day after a Reuters investigation showed why the company has failed to stem a wave of vitriolic posts about the minority Rohingya.  (For the Reuters investigation on 'Why Facebook is losing the war on hate speech in Myanmar' click, here )  Some 700,000 Rohingya fled their homes last year after an army crackdown that the United States denounced as ethnic cleansing. The Rohingya now live in teeming refugee camps in Bangladesh.  \u201cThe ethnic violence in Myanmar is horrific and we have been too slow to prevent misinformation and hate speech on Facebook,\u201d Facebook said.  The Reuters story revealed the social media giant for years dedicated scant resources to combating hate speech in Myanmar, which is a market it dominates and where there have been repeated eruptions of ethnic violence.  In early 2015, for instance, there were only two people at Facebook who could speak Burmese monitoring problematic posts.  In Thursday\u2019s statement, posted online, Facebook said it was using tools to automatically detect hate speech and hiring more Burmese-language speakers to review posts, following up on a pledge made by founder Mark Zuckerberg to U.S. senators in April.  The company said that it had over 60 \u201cMyanmar language experts\u201d in June and plans to have at least 100 by the end of the year.  Reuters found more than 1,000 examples of posts, comments, images and videos denigrating and attacking the Rohingya and other Muslims that were on the social media platform as of last week.  Some of the material, which included pornographic anti-Muslim images, has been up on Facebook for as long as six years.  There are numerous posts that call the Rohingya and other Muslims dogs and rapists, and urge they be exterminated.  Facebook currently doesn\u2019t have a single employee in Myanmar, relying instead on an outsourced, secretive operation in Kuala Lumpur \u2013 called Project Honey Badger \u2013 to monitor hate speech and other problematic posts, the Reuters investigation showed.  Because Facebook\u2019s systems struggle to interpret Burmese script, the company is heavily dependent on users reporting hate speech in Myanmar.  Researchers and human rights activists say they have been warning Facebook for years about how its platform was being used to spread hatred against the Rohingya and other Muslims in Myanmar.

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - \u201cData is the new currency\u201d is a popular management consultant mantra. If that\u2019s true, Facebook might be going backwards. The social network which has accumulated vast quantities of information about its users apparently wants to compete in the world of money. The company founded by Mark Zuckerberg is planning to launch a cryptocurrency to be called GlobalCoin by the end of 2019, the BBC reported last week, adding that it has held conversations with the Bank of England and the U.S. Treasury. The Financial Times says it has also talked with leading cryptocurrency exchanges and high-frequency trading firms. Though Facebook is not commenting, it looks like Zuckerberg is aiming high. Probably too high. A more modest approach might work. Smooth-talking consultants could make a plausible case that 2.4 billion average monthly users of the Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger platforms are the raw material for a potentially valuable business in transferring money. That would be a major new line of business for Facebook, which earned 98.5% of its revenue from advertising last year. Money could even be a bigger market than messages and photos. Total 2017 revenue in the global payments business was $2.9 trillion, according to research by McKinsey, dwarfing Facebook\u2019s $56 billion top line. Better still, the consultancy anticipates an alluring 9% annual growth rate over the next five years, as mobile phones replace cash. Chinese tech giants have shown the way. Tencent and rival Alibaba, through its financial offshoot Ant Financial, have upended electronic payments in the People\u2019s Republic. Facebook\u2019s financial business may never achieve the $150 billion valuation investors gave to Ant last year. Still, the American company\u2019s main rivals in most of the world would be banks, many of which struggle with cumbersome legacy computer systems. On the other hand, there are good reasons to be cautious about Facebook\u2019s prospects in handling cash. A company with a near-monopoly position in its core business and a 45% operating profit margin may have the wrong corporate culture to succeed in a more competitive and less profitable business. Current partner and potential rival PayPal converts little more than a quarter as much of its revenue into operating profit. Also, Facebook would face many of the same costs as competitors in the money business. Transferring cash via WhatsApp does not relieve the operator of regulatory obligations to keep records, monitor for fraud and correct errors. Indeed, a history of problems with protecting data privacy suggest Facebook might struggle with bank-like activities. And users who are only mildly irritated by receiving fake news and targeted political advertising would be less tolerant of theft and lost payments. In any case, the talk of cryptocurrencies suggests Zuckerberg is thinking about much bigger goals. He has undoubtedly received encouragement from crypto experts. That world is full of people who do not understand the political economy of money, which might lead them to think Facebook can create a successful new currency. A \u201cFaceCoin\u201d would start with a big potential user base \u2013 something that bitcoin and other existing cryptocurrencies lack. Such talk dodges the big question, though. Why would these billions of potential customers actually want to use an unfamiliar type of money? If FaceCoin\u2019s value is tied to existing local currencies, there is no good answer to that question. Alternatively, Zuckerberg might be dreaming of a currency of his own, something global, simple, and solid. There is speculation its value could be linked to a basket of currencies. This sort of talk shows the dangers of monetary confusion. The role of governments in all functioning money systems is so dominant that there is little chance for currencies without state backing to succeed. Only governments can regulate the supply and cost of money to prevent inflationary excesses or investment-killing shortages. Only governments have the political authority needed to collect taxes or create trustworthy new money to rescue depositors at failed banks. Only governments can enforce the currency monopoly which ensures that dollars or euros can be spent anywhere in a currency zone. No amount of financial technology can surmount these hard facts. Just possibly, Facebook could go in a more conventional direction. The biggest source of profit in finance has nothing to do with technology. It is the interest margin on loans. Facebook might envisage that its reputation and client base, perhaps combined with its own imagined currency, will lure attractive new borrowers. The rhetoric surrounding such a venture might be grand, but it would actually be much like an old-fashioned bank. A successful bank? Maybe, but hyper-ambitious new lenders often get into serious trouble. A government rescue of a Facebook Finance is a lot more likely than FaceCoin becoming a new global currency. Zuckerberg would be wise to stick to data.","256":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc\u2019s shares fell more than 4 percent in premarket trading after media reports that a political consultancy that worked on President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign gained inappropriate access to data on 50 million Facebook users.

One Wall Street analyst said the reports raised \u2018systemic problems\u2019 with Facebook\u2019s business model and a number said it could spur far deeper regulatory scrutiny of the platform.  The head of European Parliament said on Monday that EU lawmakers will investigate whether the data misuse has taken place, adding the allegation is an unacceptable violation of citizens\u2019 privacy rights.  Facebook was already facing new calls for regulation from U.S. Congress and questions about personal data safeguards after the reports from the New York Times and London\u2019s Observer over the weekend.  The papers reported on Saturday that private information from more than 50 million Facebook users improperly ended up in the hands of data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, and that the information had not been deleted despite Facebook demands dating back to 2015.  \u201cWe think this episode is another indication of systemic problems at Facebook,\u201d said Brian Wieser, analyst at New York-based brokerage Pivotal Research Group, which already has a \u201csell\u201d rating on a stock that rose 60 percent last year.  Wieser argued that regulatory risks for the company would intensify and enhanced use of data in advertising would be at greater risk than before.  He added, however, that it was unlikely to have a meaningful impact on the company\u2019s business for now, with advertisers unlikely to \u201csuddenly change the trajectory of their spending growth on the platform\u201d.  \u201cThis episode appears likely to create another and potentially more serious public relations \u2018black eye\u2019 for the company and could lead to additional regulatory scrutiny,\u201d said Peter Stabler, analyst at Wells Fargo.  The losses would be Facebook\u2019s biggest daily fall since a broader market pullback in February. In January, when Facebook announced changes to its newsfeed which it said would hit user engagement in the near term, shares fell 4.5 percent in one day.  \u201cIt\u2019s clear with more \u2018heat in the kitchen from the Beltway\u2019 that further modest changes to their business model around advertising and news feeds\/content could be in store over the next 12 to 18 months,\u201d said Daniel Ives, research analyst at GBH Insights.  He also argued that the issue was \u201cbackground noise\u201d on which Facebook could calm any regulatory nerves through further investments in security, ad content AI, improved content algorithms and screening mechanisms.  No analysts had so far changed their price targets or recommendations on Facebook in response to the reports. Wall Street is largely bullish on the stock with 40 of 44 analysts recommending the stock \u201cbuy\u201d or higher.

But such payment services had to be appropriately supervised and regulated so that they would not undermine financial stability, consumer protection, privacy, taxation or cybersecurity, the draft statement, seen by Reuters, said.  Without proper supervision, such stablecoins could be used for money laundering, terrorist and proliferation financing, could compromise market integrity, governance, and undermine legal certainty, it said.  \u201cThe G7 continues to maintain that no global stablecoin project should begin operation until it adequately addresses relevant legal, regulatory, and oversight requirements through appropriate design and by adhering to applicable standards,\u201d the draft said.  Stablecoins are tied to a traditional currency or basket of assets, and used for payments or storing value.

Shares rose about 4.5% after hours to $196.64. That put the shares on track to eclipse their record closing high of $194.32 in June 2018, just before a dramatic drop that summer amid escalating costs.  Over the last three years, Facebook, the world\u2019s largest social media company, has faced rising hostility from both users and lawmakers over its handling of user data and its inability to ensure the integrity of its popular news feeds.  Zuckerberg opened his earnings conference call on Wednesday by defending the company's policy to run ads from politicians containing false or misleading claims, saying that Facebook did not want to stifle political speech, even as rival Twitter Inc TWTR.N said earlier in the day that it was banning political ads around the globe.  Facebook on Monday confirmed to Reuters that some employees had criticized its policy in an internal letter. Zuckerberg estimated ads from politicians would account for under 0.5% of Facebook\u2019s revenue next year.  \u201cI expect that this is going to be a very tough year,\u201d he said, adding that controversies over political content could lead to investigations.  Zuckerberg last week was barraged with aggressive questions by lawmakers over Facebook\u2019s steps to combat misinformation ahead of next year\u2019s presidential election when he appeared at a Congressional hearing.  Facebook\u2019s competitive practices currently are under investigation separately by the U.S. Congress, Department of Justice, FTC and 47 state attorneys general.  Zuckerberg said that much of the scrutiny would be around the company\u2019s acquisition of Instagram in 2012, but he said that though Facebook took out a competitor, its eventual success was not guaranteed at the time.  Facebook executives, whom analysts say typically offer conservative guidance, continued to warn that the company\u2019s revenue could be hurt by external challenges including new features on Facebook and internet browsers enabling people to block the type of online tracking that has been essential to Facebook\u2019s algorithms for targeting ads.  But financial analysts said Facebook remains too popular among users for advertisers to ignore.  FILE PHOTO: Figurines are seen in front of the Facebook logo in this illustration taken March 20, 2018. REUTERS  \u201cYes, Facebook has a lot of challenges it must deal with, but increasing its revenue and user count isn\u2019t one of them,\u201d Debra Aho, eMarketer principal analyst, said in an email.  COST CONTROL  Facebook\u2019s total expenses in the third quarter were $10.5 billion, up 32% compared with a year ago. The third-quarter operating margin was 41%, compared with 42% a year ago.  Facebook forecast 2019 total expenses at approximately $46 billion to $48 billion, or an increase of 55% at the high end of the range compared with 2018. It estimated 2020 total expenses in the range of $54 billion to $59 billion, up 23% over this year\u2019s estimate at the high end.  Concerns over privacy have fueled an acceleration in costs for privacy staff and other roles. Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet Inc\u2019s GOOGL.O Google also have been under pressure to police their platforms after facing criticism for failing to counter alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  GRAPHIC: Facebook costs and revenue over five quarters -  Third-quarter revenue rose 29% compared with a year ago to $17.65 billion, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $17.37 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Facebook, the world\u2019s No. 2 seller of online ads, said revenue would grow more slowly in the fourth quarter, at closer to about 20% to 25%, partly due to users choosing to limit the company\u2019s ability to target ads to them using personal details.  Facebook reported $6.09 billion in profit, or $2.12 per share. Analysts expected $5.47 billion in profit, or $1.91 per share.  For the quarter, the company reported 2.8 billion monthly users and 2.2 billion daily users across Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, both slightly higher than the prior quarter.  Facebook itself had 1.62 billion daily users, versus estimates of 1.61 billion. After experiencing stagnant user growth in Europe and the United States in previous quarters, Facebook added daily users compared to the previous quarter in all four of its regions for the first time this year.  Facebook shares have gained about 43.6% this year through Wednesday\u2019s close, thanks to above-expectations revenue in the first half of the year. The company reached a $5 billion settlement in a U.S. Federal Trade Commission probe, which started after its Cambridge Analytica data misuse scandal and threatened to cost the company several more billions.  Facebook\u2019s existing businesses continue to grow at a fast pace. But whether it can maintain the momentum has been unclear with newer ventures including privacy-focused messaging services, its expansion into online dating or its burgeoning features for group discussions and eBay-like shopping center.  Last week, Facebook also started to test Facebook News, a new section of its mobile app dedicated to \u201chigh-quality news,\u201d which will see some publishers paid for access to their content.  But the company came under fire from some political activists over its decision to include right-wing news website Breitbart News as one of its publishers. Facebook said Breitbart will be an unpaid publisher.

The deal announced on Wednesday is Facebook\u2019s biggest since its $22 billion buyout of WhatsApp in 2014 and will give the Menlo Park, California-based firm a stake in Jio Platforms - the digital services entity that houses Reliance\u2019s telecoms arm Jio Infocomm, as well as its news, movie and music apps, along with other businesses.  The transaction is also the eighth largest deal in Asia this year based on deal value, according to Refinitiv data, and comes at a time when the coronavirus outbreak has stifled mergers and acquisitions activity globally.  To kick off the partnership, Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp messenger, which counts India as its biggest market with about 400 million users, will help fuel the growth of Jio\u2019s new retail venture, JioMart, the two companies said.  \u201cIn the near future JioMart ... and WhatsApp will empower nearly 30 million small Indian kirana (grocery) shops to digitally transact with every customer in their neighborhood,\u201d Mukesh Ambani, Reliance chairman and Asia\u2019s richest man, said in a video statement.  JioMart, the e-commerce venture of Reliance's retail arm, offers customers free express grocery deliveries from neighborhood mum-and-pop stores. It is yet to be launched across India, and is likely to pose a formidable challenge to Amazon.com's AMZN.O local unit and Walmart's WMT.N Flipkart, which are also betting big on groceries to grow.  For Reliance, the deal will help the oil-to-retail group, which bet over $30 billion on the Jio telecoms venture, reduce its debt load.  FACEBOOK INDIA ROADMAP  The companies said the potential benefits of the deal were manifold, but shied away from giving details.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  \u201cWe will really look to explore multiple areas of collaboration,\u201d Ajit Mohan, the India head of Facebook, told journalists on a call. \u201cAnd the spirit of it will be - can we open new doors? Can we open new avenues?\u201d  The investment, according to tech and retail analysts, will give Facebook new means to expand in India, its biggest market outside of the United States.  Facebook\u2019s offerings such as WhatsApp Business, which allows businesses to catalog products and send automated replies, and a payment service, could be handy tools for millions of small retailers and customers that Reliance wants to tie together.  The alliance with Jio, which has over 380 million subscribers, could also help WhatsApp evolve into an Indian version of Chinese internet giant Tencent's 0700.HK WeChat, which allows users to chat, make payments and book flights and hotels, a source with direct knowledge of the deal said.  \u201cThe idea is to turn the Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram ecosystem into something like that. What Facebook don\u2019t want to do is go out and deal with the physical task of building warehouses, keeping inventory. They don\u2019t want to be a Walmart or an Amazon,\u201d the source added, declining to be identified as details of the deal were private.  RELIANCE\u2019S SWAY  The perceived closeness between Reliance chairman Ambani - who has net worth of $49.2 billion, according to Forbes - and India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party could also ease Facebook\u2019s struggles in country which has taken Big Tech to task over issues such as misinformation and data privacy, sources said.  WhatsApp\u2019s payments service has been awaiting regulatory clearances for nearly two years, and India has previously blamed WhatsApp for the spread of misinformation and fake news.  Facebook\u2019s Mohan, however, played down the idea of the deal being aimed at smoothing regulatory issues, saying it was squarely focused on meeting the needs of small business owners.  Reliance has always pitched Jio as a technology company and it is using its financial muscle to build smart homes, which could rival Amazon\u2019s Alexa-based solutions, connected cars and security systems. For all of those, it could potentially tap into Facebook\u2019s tech prowess.  \"They (Reliance) have great ambition. As they try to build a retail business on top of the core Jio base, this deal provides them with a mechanism for not having to go through a hit and trial method, but leverage some technologies that are proven,\" said Atul Kunwar, a former Chief Technology officer at one of India's biggest IT firms, Tech Mahindra TEML.NS.  Shares in Reliance ended 10% higher after rising as much as 12% earlier on the news, contributing nearly half the gains on the NSE Nifty 50 index on Wednesday.

Schrems, long a thorn in the side of Facebook, bemoaned the lack of progress since the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regime across Europe in 2018.  FILE PHOTO: Austrian lawyer and privacy activist Max Schrems smiles during a Reuters interview in Vienna, Austria, May 22, 2018. REUTERS\/Heinz-Peter Bader  \u201cAfter two years, we feel that the time has come to shine light on the shortcomings of the GDPR\u2019s current enforcement in Ireland and bring the debate into the public,\u201d the letter, published on Monday, says.  The procedure adopted by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) was \u201chighly inefficient and partly Kafkaesque.\u201d  The letter\u2019s recipients are the national data protection authorities, the European Commission, the EU Parliament and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB).  The GDPR overhauled data protection laws in the European Union that predated the rise of the internet and, most importantly, gave regulators the power to impose fines of up to 4 percent of global revenues for companies that break the rules.  Schrems, who previously won a landmark European ruling on data transfer in 2015, said he would seek a judicial review of the DPC\u2019s actions at the Irish High Court as soon as coronavirus-related restrictions are lifted.  Ireland\u2019s DPC, asked for comment on the letter, said it had currently 23 \u201cbig tech\u201d inquiries open and last Friday announced significant developments in a number of these inquiries, including three that were initiated after complaints received from Max Schrems\u2019s non-profit organisation noyb.  \u201cOne of these complaint-based inquiries, which focuses on Facebook Ireland\u2019s obligations to establish a lawful basis for personal data processing, has now moved to the decision-making phase,\u201d the DPC said.  Schrems filed complaints against Google, Facebook and its affiliates Instagram and WhatsApp immediately after GDPR came into effect in May 2018, arguing that their approach violated the rights of users to choose themselves whether to allow companies to use their data.  The Irish Data Protection Commission is the lead regulator in the Facebook cases as the firm has its European headquarters in Dublin.  The case against Google was dealt with in France, where the regulator CNIL imposed a 50 million euro fine for breaching the EU privacy rules in January last year.  Schrems said the Irish watchdog had requested to keep documents confidential and to not even share them with other national counterparts.  \u201cWe request the European Commission to act and issue infringement procedures against any member state with legislation that prevents the effective application of the GDPR, with overly complicated and long procedures, or without any effective remedy against delayed procedures,\u201d the letter says.

The owner of Priceline, Kayak and Booking.com on Monday confirmed that it had pulled out of the group, which is trying to bring digital coins into mainstream commerce.  Libra lost its last global payments backers on Friday, when Mastercard Inc MA.N and Visa Inc V.N abandoned the Geneva-based Libra Association. EBay Inc EBAY.O, fintech startup Stripe and payments company Mercado Pago also pulled the plug.  The exodus followed warnings from politicians and regulators, from the United States to Europe, that Libra risked upsetting global financial stability, undermining users\u2019 privacy and facilitating money laundering.  The latest withdrawals followed the departure of PayPal Holdings Inc PYPL.O from the Libra Association earlier this month. It leaves Facebook without the backing of any major payments firms for the project, due to launch by June 2020.  Disparte acknowledged that the digital currency\u2019s regulatory issues could push back its launch date.  At the meeting in Geneva, members agreed interim articles of association laying out how the organization will be governed, as required by Swiss law, according to a fact sheet provided by the Libra Association.  Most decisions will require a majority vote of the group\u2019s governing council, although changes to membership or management of the reserve would require a two-third supermajority.  The group elected five people to serve on the board, including Facebook\u2019s David Marcus as well as representatives from PayU, venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, blockchain company Xapo Holdings Limited and non-profit Kiva Microfunds.  The association's other prominent remaining members include Vodafone Group Plc VOD.L and ride-hailing firms Uber Technologies Inc UBER.N and Lyft Inc LYFT.O.  Its only payments firm remaining is Netherlands-based PayU, which according to its website does not operate in the United States, Canada or large swaths of Africa and the Middle East.  The departure of major financial firms means Facebook can no longer count on a global player to help consumers turn their currency into Libra and facilitate transactions. This presents a new stumbling block for Libra\u2019s efforts to convince regulators and politicians about the coin\u2019s safety.  France pledged last month to block Libra from operating in Europe, while the Bank of England laid out high hurdles it must meet before its launch. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has also suggested the project could not advance before concerns were assuaged.  Libra, announced as Facebook expands into e-commerce, will be backed by a reserve of real-world assets, including bank deposits and short-term government securities, and overseen by the Libra Association.  The structure is intended to foster trust and stabilize the price volatility that plagues cryptocurrencies and renders them impractical for commerce and payments.","269":"PARIS (Reuters) - G7 ministers meeting in France on Wednesday agreed on the need to confront the emergence of digital currencies following Facebook\u2019s plans to launch its Libra digital coin, a French G7 presidency source said on Wednesday.

FILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is displayed on a smartphone in this illustration taken January 6, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  The videoconferencing tool, Messenger Rooms, will enable as many as 50 people to participate in a call, the company said in a statement. It will display a tiled layout of participant videos - up to 16 on desktop and 8 on mobile - resembling the design offered by competitor Zoom ZM.O.  Zoom\u2019s share price sank 3.7% from the day prior to about $163 in the minutes following the announcement, after hitting a record high of $181.50 earlier in the day. The move in Facebook\u2019s shares was less dramatic, up 2.4% from the previous day to $189.51.  Facebook users will be able to share links enabling non-users to join Rooms via a web browser on both desktop and mobile, eliminating requirements to download an app or create an account as on other services.  There will be no time limits on the calls.  With the launch, Facebook joins a crowded field of companies rushing to dominate the market for video meetings, as millions of people locked in their homes around the world are suddenly reliant on the tools for work, school and social life.  Elements of the product had been slated for release in the third and fourth quarters of the year, but Facebook accelerated its plans after observing a spike in group calling during the lockdowns, Head of Messenger Stan Chudnovsky told Reuters.  \u201cOur video calls doubled, and when we\u2019re looking at the group calls usage, that went up even higher,\u201d said Chudnovsky. \u201cSo we figured out a way to build those things faster.\u201d  Facebook said in its statement there were now more than 700 million accounts participating in calls on WhatsApp and Messenger each day.  Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Zoom Video Communications ZM.O, Cisco Systems Inc CSCO.O and Alphabet's Google GOOGL.O also have rolled out updates of their video meeting tools while reporting record growth since the lockdowns began.  On Tuesday, Microsoft introduced a new \u201cMeet Now\u201d for Skype that can accommodate video meetings of up to 50 people without downloading any apps. Google, whose Meet tool for businesses has been its fastest-growing service this year, said this month that it was working on enhancements for consumers too.  PREEMINENCE OF MESSENGER  Chudnovsky said Facebook\u2019s free offering is focused squarely on the consumer market with Messenger Rooms and is not currently making overtures to businesses, the main source of revenue for most other videoconferencing apps.  The company is simultaneously expanding its livestreaming offerings, such as an option to add a guest to a live video on the core Facebook app and the ability to save live videos on Instagram to the IGTV video-sharing app.  Its decision to build Rooms on Messenger\u2019s infrastructure asserts the app\u2019s preeminence as the company begins to realize Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s vision to weave together its messaging services, offering a first glimpse at how that integration will be structured.  Messenger Rooms will be accessible across the social network\u2019s sprawling array of online gathering spaces, enabling users to jump into group video meetings directly from News Feed as well as in Groups and Events pages.  Facebook is also planning to add buttons within messaging service WhatsApp and the chat function of Instagram, although those users will be prompted to open Messenger to create Rooms, said Chudnovsky.  The company is simultaneously expanding group video calling within WhatsApp, which has more users than Messenger, but is capping the number of participants there at eight people.  Chudnovsky said Zuckerberg\u2019s plan to extend end-to-end encryption across messaging services would also apply to Messenger Rooms. \u201cWe would like to have it all encrypted if possible,\u201d he said.  The encryption plan is lauded by privacy advocates but has met stiff resistance in Washington, where lawmakers warn it could hinder the fight against child abuse and other illegal activities.","271":"The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has urged a federal appeals court to rule that hundreds of Facebook Inc advertising sales workers who signed arbitration agreements should not be given notice of a collective action accusing the social media giant of improperly denying them overtime pay.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  The government said in a statement that it had issued an order requiring Facebook \u201cto publish a correction notice\u201d on a Nov. 23 post which contained accusations about the arrest of a supposed whistleblower and election rigging.  Singapore said the allegations were \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cscurrilous\u201d and initially ordered user Alex Tan, who runs the States Times Review blog, to issue the correction notice on the post. Tan, who does not live in Singapore and says he is an Australian citizen, refused and authorities said he is now under investigation.  Facebook said in a statement that it was reviewing a request from the Singapore government, but declined to comment further.  Tan\u2019s post remained up as of mid-afternoon on Friday, with a Nov. 28 update noting that the government denied the arrest. Tan also posted the article on Twitter, LinkedIn and Google Docs and challenged the government to order corrections there as well.  Facebook has been under fire in recent years for its lax approach to fake news reports, state-backed disinformation campaigns and violent content spread on its services, prompting calls for new regulations around the world.  It is also frequently criticized for being too willing to do the bidding of governments in stamping out political dissent.  Facebook often blocks content that governments allege violate local laws, with nearly 18,000 cases globally in the year to June, according to the company\u2019s \u201ctransparency report.\u201d  But the new Singapore law is the first to demand that Facebook publish corrections when directed to do so by the government, and it remains unclear how Facebook plans to respond to the order.  The case is the first big test for a law that was two years in the making and came into effect last month.  The Asia Internet Coalition, an association of internet and technology companies, called the law the \u201cmost far-reaching legislation of its kind to date\u201d, while rights groups have said it could undermine internet freedoms, not just in Singapore, but elsewhere in Southeast Asia.  Facebook has previously said it was \u201cconcerned with aspects of the new law which grant broad powers to the Singapore executive branch to compel us to remove content they deem to be false and to push a government notification to users.\u201d  In the only other case under the law, which covers statements that are communicated in the country even if they originate elsewhere, opposition political figure Brad Bowyer swiftly complied with a correction request.  The penalties range from prison terms of as much as 10 years or fines up to S$1 million ($735,000).

The social media giant shocked Australia on Thursday when it blocked all media content from its platform in a stunning escalation of a dispute with the government over paying for content.  The move came after the government of Scott Morrison drafted a law to require Facebook and Google to reach commercial deals with news outlets whose links drive traffic to their platforms, or be subjected to forced arbitration to agree a price.  \u201cIf you gain value from carrying trusted sources of information - in the same way as if you gain value for example from music streams - then those that carry those and then sell advertising off the back of that value, should pay for it,\u201d Knight said.  \u201cI think they\u2019re almost using Australia as a test of strength for global democracies as to whether or not they wish to impose restrictions on the way in which they do business, or corrections to the way in which they operate within markets.

In a separate statement, Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs said that \u201cFacebook\u2019s independent investors agree that it\u2019s time for the company to separate the Board Chair and CEO roles. Right now, Mr. Zuckerberg is both Board Chair and CEO, serving as his own boss, and clearly it\u2019s not working.\u201d  A Facebook representative declined to comment on the remarks, or on similar comments made by the treasurers of Connecticut, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania.  The company is under pressure from investors over data privacy issues and its role in elections, which have attracted scrutiny from regulators.  Stringer and Frerichs oversee pension funds that hold Facebook shares and were among a group of investors who filed a shareholder resolution calling for Facebook to have an independent chair as a way to improve oversight.  Facebook opposed the idea at its annual meeting held last week, saying its lead independent director already can represent all stockholder interests.  The reform was never likely to pass, because Zuckerberg and other insiders control 58 percent of Facebook\u2019s voting power through a special class of shares carrying 10 times the voting power of standard shares.  But voting results from the meeting released late on Monday showed that excluding the roughly 4 billion shares held by Zuckerberg and other insiders, the measure calling for an independent chair would have received support from 68 percent of outside investors.

Europe\u2019s top court on Thursday rejected the so-called Privacy Shield agreement but upheld the validity of another tool used by hundreds of thousands of companies to transfer data worldwide.  The court\u2019s decision on the Privacy Shield is based on \u201coverreaching US surveillance laws that only protect U.S. persons but not foreigners,\u201d non-profit Noyb, which Schrems chairs, said in a statement.  The privacy activist veteran, who took his first legal action against Facebook as a student in 2011, hopes that the ruling will, in the long term, lead to a reform of U.S. surveillance law.  For the companies themselves, these surveillance laws were a burden.  \u201cThe Court clarified for a second time now that there is a clash of EU privacy law and U.S. surveillance law,\u201d Schrems said. As the EU would not change its fundamental rights, the only way to overcome this clash was for the U.S. to introduce solid privacy rights for all people including foreigners.  \u201cSurveillance reform thereby becomes crucial for the business interests of Silicon Valley,\u201d Schrems said.  U.S. concerns regarding American data outsourced to Beijing when people use Chinese technology such as Huawei [HWT.UL] or TikTok followed the same logic as the concerns he had raised in his complaint against Facebook, Schrems has said.","280":"NEW YORK, July 31 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc on Wednesday defeated an appeal by American victims of Hamas attacks in Israel, who sought to hold the company liable for providing the group a social media platform to further its goals.

Following are major U.S. government lawsuits and investigations regarding Big Tech.  1) 38 U.S. states and territories sue Google  A lawsuit by 38 U.S. states and territories accuses Google of abusing its market power to try to make its search engine as dominant inside cars, TVs and speakers as it is in phones.  2) Justice Department lawsuit against Google  The U.S. Justice Department sued Google in October, accusing the $1 trillion company of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals. The states that filed their lawsuit on Thursday have said they will seek to consolidate their complaint with the Justice Department\u2019s.  3) Texas, others sue Google  Texas, backed by nine other states, filed a lawsuit against Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google this week, accusing the internet search company of breaking antitrust law in how it runs its online advertising business.  4) and 5) Federal Trade Commission and states sue Facebook  The FTC and a major coalition of states are asking that Facebook be forced to sell WhatsApp and Instagram, saying the social media company used a \u201cbuy or bury\u201d strategy to snap up rivals and keep smaller competitors at bay.  Justice Department investigates Apple:  This probe, revealed in June 2019, appears to focus on Apple\u2019s app store. Some app developers have accused Apple of introducing new products very similar to existing apps created by other developers and sold in the Apple Store, and then trying to banish the older apps from the store because they compete with Apple\u2019s new product. Apple says it seeks to have only the highest-quality apps in the app store.  Justice Department probing Facebook and Amazon:  In July 2019, the Justice Department said it was expanding its Big Tech probes to include \u201csearch, social media, and some retail services online\u201d - an apparent reference to Facebook and Amazon.

(Reporting by Moscow newsroom)","284":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc soundly beat quarterly revenue estimates on Wednesday after heavy holiday advertising by e-commerce retailers, but it warned Apple\u2019s impending privacy changes could hurt revenue by interfering with ad targeting.  The world\u2019s biggest social media company said it expected to face \u201csignificant ad targeting headwinds in 2021.\u201d Facebook forecast that Apple\u2019s update of its iPhone operating system to iOS 14 could start biting into revenues as early as the end of the first quarter.  Shares were flat after hours following an initial drop.  The fourth-quarter results validated the company\u2019s focus on making it easier for retailers to sell products to Facebook users, who frequently were stuck at home last year during the COVID-19 pandemic.  For example, Facebook launched Facebook Pay and Facebook Shops which enable consumers to click on ads and make purchases without leaving the company\u2019s apps, which also include Instagram and WhatsApp.  The company said the pandemic-driven surge in online commerce and shift in consumer demand to products over services buoyed revenue growth, which has been cooling steadily as its business matures.  Total revenue, which consists almost entirely of advertising sales, rose 33% to $28.07 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 from $21.08 billion a year earlier.  FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen placed on a keyboard in this illustration taken March 25, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  Analysts on average estimated quarterly revenue of $26.44 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Net income came in at $11.22 billion, or $3.88 per share, compared with $7.35 billion, or $2.56 per share, a year earlier.  Monthly active users rose 12% to 2.80 billion, above the 2.75 billion expected by analysts.  REDUCING POLITICAL CONTENT  While financially strong, Facebook has faced criticism about misinformation and calls for violence on its platforms tied to the U.S. presidential election, including the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6.  Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told investors in a call that he wanted to \u201cturn down the temperature\u201d of political conversations because \u201cpeople don\u2019t want politics and fighting to take over their experience on our services.\u201d  An election-related moratorium on political-group recommendations to U.S. users will become permanent and political content in the network\u2019s newsfeed will drop. These changes will not hurt Facebook\u2019s financial outlook, he said.  Zuckerberg also took aim at Apple Inc, which he said Facebook executives increasingly view as the company\u2019s biggest competitor, even though the iPhone maker earns only a small fraction of its income from digital advertising.  Apple\u2019s business \u201cdepends more and more on gaining share in apps and services,\u201d said Zuckerberg, giving it \u201cevery incentive to use (its) dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work.\u201d  Facebook has feuded with Apple for months over the iPhone maker\u2019s plan to limit app developers\u2019 collection of user data from other apps. Facebook uses the data to improve ad targeting.  The social network, which is facing U.S. antitrust lawsuits from both the Federal Trade Commission and dozens of states, accuses Apple of behaving anticompetitively.  Analysts said Facebook is less likely to suffer from Apple\u2019s privacy updates than other ad-supported companies that have less access to their own first-party data.  \u201cIn the end, I don\u2019t think Facebook will be impacted as much as others as Facebook can provide workarounds for ad targeting,\u201d said analyst Jonathan Kees of Summit Insights Group.","285":"FILE PHOTO: German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz holds a virtual news conference in Berlin, Germany, November 27, 2020.

The European Commission sent out a questionnaire earlier this month to various parties involved in Libra, giving respondents two to three weeks to provide feedback, the people said. By sending out a questionnaire, the EU could be preparing the ground for a formal investigation.  The EU competition enforcer\u2019s main focus is on the use of consumer data, the people said.  Facebook has linked up with 28 partners in a Geneva-based entity called the Libra Association, which will govern its new digital coin, which is due to launch in the first half of 2020.  \u201cThe Commission is in particular concerned about the possible competition restrictions that may result from the Association, especially with regard to information that will be exchanged and the use of consumer data,\u201d the questionnaire said.  The Commission, which can fine companies up to 10% of their global turnover for breaching EU antitrust rules and order them to change their business practices, declined to comment. Facebook was not immediately available for comment.  The EU\u2019s queries about Libra follow recent calls from politicians, central bankers and regulatory watchdogs for tight regulation of Libra to avoid disrupting the global financial system amid concerns that it may be used to launder money and could also affect the privacy of users.

However, Twitter\u2019s director of global public policy strategy and development Nick Pickles said the company had seen a shift from platform manipulation to public tweets from state media and government accounts.  Democratic Representative Jim Himes pressed Facebook\u2019s head of security policy Nathaniel Gleicher on what the company was doing to deal with the concern that its algorithm promotes polarization.  \u201cIf every single American household is full of toxic, explosive gas, as I think it is today, all it takes is a match from Russia or from Iran or from North Korea or from China to set off a conflagration,\u201d said Himes.

The debate over content moderation has intensified in recent weeks. Twitter and Facebook have diverged on how to handle inflammatory posts by President Donald Trump, which Facebook\u2019s Gleicher was pressed on at the hearing.  Trump, in turn, has accused social media companies of censorship and called for the government to roll back liability protections for tech platforms.  Asked about changes to this law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, Gleicher said the company would comply with the law if Congress made changes, but that the shield it creates is essential for Facebook to do its work.

REUTERS\/Charles Platiau  The probe is being closely watched in Europe amid mounting concerns over leaks of data on tens of millions of Facebook users, as well as the extensive use of targeted ads by foreign powers seeking to influence elections in the United States.  The Federal Cartel Office objects in particular to how Facebook acquires data on people from third-party apps - including its own WhatsApp and Instagram services - and its online tracking of people who aren\u2019t even members.  \u201cWe are conscious that this should, and must, go quickly,\u201d cartel office President Andreas Mundt told a news conference on Monday, adding that he hoped to take \u201cfirst steps\u201d this year. He declined to elaborate.  The German probe is not expected to end in fines for Facebook, in contrast to European Union probes into Google that have ended in multi-billion-dollar penalties, most recently over the preinstallation of its apps on Android smartphones.  Sources familiar with the matter say, however, that the cartel office could require Facebook to take action to address its concerns if the company fails to do so voluntarily.  Facebook responded earlier this year to the cartel office\u2019s request for information, and the authority was reviewing whether new features - such as a \u201cclear history\u201d option announced by CEO Mark Zuckerberg in May - would address its concerns.  \u201cWe need to establish whether this affects our investigation and addresses our concerns,\u201d Mundt said.  Separately, Mundt confirmed comments he made in a newspaper interview earlier this month that he may launch an investigation into the e-commerce industry under new powers that enable the cartel office to launch sector-wide probes.  The focus would be on so-called \"hybrid\" platforms such as U.S. e-commerce giant Amazon AMZN.O that sell their own products and services, but that also host third-party traders.  \u201cOur question is: what is the relationship between the platform, which itself is a very powerful trader, and the traders who use the platform?\u201d said Mundt. He added that Amazon was the best-known of the e-commerce platforms but his interest in the matter extended to other players.  The cartel office would not be looking at suspected tax evasion by third-party traders on e-commerce platforms - an issue that Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government has vowed to tackle - saying this was a matter for economic policy makers.","294":"FILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is displayed on a smartphone in this illustration taken January 6, 2020.

The accusations have spurred a congressional inquiry and a separate Supreme Court investigation into so-called \u201cfake news attacks\u201d on the country\u2019s judiciary, which led to police raids in May on the homes and offices of Bolsonaro allies.  Bolsonaro, who is also under mounting criticism over his handling of the coronavirus outbreak, has said the court\u2019s investigation is unconstitutional and risks establishing censorship in Brazil by policing what people can say online.  Facebook has come under increasing pressure in recent weeks to better police how political groups use its platform. Hundreds of advertisers have joined a boycott aimed at forcing the company to block hate speech on its site, and multiple employees walked out last month over CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s decision not to challenge inflammatory posts Trump.  Gleicher said his team had identified and suspended more than 80 accounts on Facebook and its photo-sharing site, Instagram, as part of the Brazilian network. The accounts had amassed 1.8 million followers, he said, and some dated back to 2018.  Researchers at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab, who spent a week analysing the activity identified by Facebook, said they had found five current and former political staffers who registered and operated the accounts.

More recently, the accounts also amplified Bolsonaro\u2019s claims that the risks of the coronavirus pandemic are exaggerated. The disease has killed more than 66,000 people in Brazil and Bolsonaro himself tested positive this week.  \u201cWe have known for a long time that when people disagree with Bolsonaro they are targeted by this machine that uses online disinformation to mock and discredit them,\u201d said Bandeira.  \u201cSo knowing now that part of these attacks are coming from people directly related to the Bolsonaro family, that explains a lot.\u201d","297":"Rockville, MD (Reuters) - Instagram on Monday said co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger have resigned as chief executive officer and chief technical officer of the photo-sharing app owned by Facebook Inc, giving scant explanation for the move.

INDEPENDENCE  Koum\u2019s departure in May followed the exit of his WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton.  FILE PHOTO: Instagram founders Mike Krieger (L) and Kevin Systrom attend the 16th annual Webby Awards in New York May, 21 2012. REUTERS\/Stephen Chernin\/File photo  That led to a reshuffling of Facebook\u2019s executive ranks, increasing Zuckerberg\u2019s ability to influence day-to-day operations. Zuckerberg ally Chris Cox, who leads product development for Facebook\u2019s main app, gained oversight of WhatsApp and Instagram, which had been given independence when Facebook bought them.  Adam Mosseri, who had overseen Facebook\u2019s news feed and spent a decade working closely with Zuckerberg, became Instagram\u2019s head of product.  Instagram and Facebook have operated independently and the two services barely mention each other. But as regulators have pushed Facebook to improve information safeguards for individual privacy, to combat addiction to social media, and to stop misinformation or fake news, Zuckerberg and other leaders have been under more pressure to monitor units beyond the core social network.  ACQUISITION DONE RIGHT  Systrom and Krieger notified the photo-sharing app\u2019s leadership team and Facebook on Monday about their decision to leave, Instagram said. Their departure would be soon, it said. The New York Times first reported the move.  Systrom and Krieger met through Stanford University and worked separately in Silicon Valley before forming Instagram in 2010.  Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion. The photo-sharing app has over 1 billion active monthly users and has grown by adding features such as messaging and short videos. In 2016, it added the ability to post slideshows that disappear in 24 hours, mimicking the \u201cstories\u201d feature of Snap Inc\u2019s Snapchat.  The photo app\u2019s global revenue this year is likely to exceed $8 billion, showed data from advertising consultancy EMarketer.  Increased advertising on Instagram has seen the average price-per-ad across Facebook\u2019s apps decline this year after a year of upswing. A new privacy law in Europe also has affected prices.  Instagram had been hailed in Silicon Valley as a flashy acquisition done right, with the team kept relatively small and Systrom having the freedom to add features such as peer-to-peer messaging, video uploads and advertising.  \u201cI see Mark [Zuckerberg] practice a tremendous amount of restraint in giving us the freedom to run, but the reason why I think he gives us the freedom to run is because when we run, it typically works,\u201d Systrom told Recode last June.  The app\u2019s latest product, IGTV, has been slow to gain traction. Offered through Instagram and as a standalone app, IGTV serves up longer-length video content, mostly from popular Instagram users.  Video content has been a major emphasis for Facebook as it seeks to satisfy advertisers\u2019 desire to stream more commercials online.","298":"(Reuters) - A former Facebook Inc contract employee filed a lawsuit in California, alleging that content moderators who face mental trauma after reviewing distressing images on the platform are not being properly protected by the social networking company.

Nelson\u2019s firm is seeking class-action status for the lawsuit.  Scola worked at Facebook\u2019s offices in Menlo Park and Mountain View, California, for nine months from June last year, under a contract through Pro Unlimited Inc, a Florida-based staffing company.  The case is Scola v Facebook Inc and Pro Unlimited Inc, No. 18 CIV0513, filed in Superior Court of the State of California.","299":"PARIS (Reuters) - Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg hailed France\u2019s efforts to regulate hateful content online as a model for the European Union after meeting President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Friday.  His comments come after the U.S. social media giant was heavily criticized by politicians and the public for its failure to more rapidly remove footage of the March shooting attack in Christchurch, New Zealand, from its network.  Fifty people were killed in the assault, with footage of it circulating online for days.  Zuckerberg\u2019s meeting with Macron coincided with the release of a report commissioned by the French leader recommending increased oversight of Facebook and an independent regulator to police the efforts of large tech companies to deal with hate speech.  \u201cIf more countries can follow the lead of what your government has done here, that will likely end up being a more positive outcome for the world in my view than some of the alternatives,\u201d Zuckerberg told reporters at Facebook\u2019s Paris office after the meeting at the Elysee palace.  \u201cWe need new rules for the internet that will spell out the responsibilities of companies and those of governments,\u201d he told France 2 television in an interview. \u201cThat is why we want to work with the team of President Macron. We need a public process.\u201d  The French president wants France to take a leading role on tech regulation, seeking to strike a balance between what he perceives as the United States\u2019 laissez-faire stance and China\u2019s iron grip on the internet.  The 33-page report, co-written by a former lobbyist for Google France, recommends that French authorities should have more access to Facebook\u2019s algorithms and greater scope to audit the company\u2019s internal policies against hate speech.  The report comes after Facebook allowed a team of French regulators to spend six months inside the company monitoring its policies. It represents a \u201chalf-time\u201d assessment for their stint which started in January.  \u201cThe inadequacy and lack of credibility in the self-regulatory approach adopted by the largest platforms justify public intervention to make them more responsible,\u201d the report said.  Companies like Facebook cannot simply declare themselves to be transparent, it added, noting that checking the integrity of the algorithms they use was a particularly complex task.  \u2018DOMINATING POSITION\u2019  However, the convergence between French regulators and big tech companies was criticized by some internet lobby groups.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  \u201cUp to now, in terms of regulation, only the internet giants have been invited to the table, while others wait for decisions to be taken to have more visibility,\u201d Constance Bommelaer de Leusse of non-profit group Internet Society said.  \u201cThis only reinforces the dominating position of Web giants,\u201d she said.  This week, Chris Hughes, one of the founders of Facebook with Zuckerberg while they were at Harvard, wrote in a long opinion piece in the New York Times that he believed the company was too powerful and needed to be broken up.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Zuckerberg declined to comment on Hughes\u2019 piece when asked by reporters in Paris, but Nick Clegg, his global communication head and a former British deputy prime minister, dismissed it as \u201cmelodramatic\u201d.  \u201cFor us, the alternative to these melodramatic calls for breaking up companies is exactly what we\u2019re discussing here, which is proper regulation. What the tech sector needs is not to be broken up, it is proper rules,\u201d Clegg said.  France\u2019s parliament, where Macron\u2019s ruling party has a comfortable majority, is debating legislation that would give the new regulator the power to fine tech companies up to 4% of their global revenue if they don\u2019t do enough to remove hateful content from their network.  Facebook\u2019s decision to allow the team of French regulators inside the company was the first time the company had opened its doors in such a way.  Facebook\u2019s shares fell as much as 5% in a single day following the Christchurch shooting, but have since risen by about 10%, helped by good first-quarter results.","300":"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Facebook Inc FB.O on Tuesday said it would stop Australians sharing news content on its platforms if a proposal to make it pay local media outlets for their content becomes law, escalating tension with the Australian government.  The world\u2019s largest social network also updated its \u201cterms of use\u201d on Tuesday to say that it can block content anywhere globally or restrict users from accessing the services if such a move is warranted to avoid regulatory risks.  \u201cThis global update provides more flexibility for us to change our services, including in Australia, to continue to operate and support our users in response to potential regulation or legal action,\u201d a company spokesperson said.  Under Australia's closely watched internet reform, the country will become the first to make the social media behemoth and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google pay for news sourced from local providers under a royalty-style system.  Facebook\u2019s plan to block the sharing of news on Australian user accounts, rather than pay royalties, puts the firm broadly in step with Google on the matter and pushes the prospect of an agreement with the government further out of reach.  \u201cAssuming this draft code becomes law, we will reluctantly stop allowing publishers and people in Australia from sharing local and international news on Facebook and Instagram,\u201d Facebook Australia Managing Director Will Easton said in a blog post, referring to two Facebook-owned platforms.  \u201cThis is not our first choice - it is our last. It is the only way to protect against an outcome that defies logic and will hurt, not help, the long-term vibrancy of Australia\u2019s news and media sector\u201d.  Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Tuesday said the proposed law was in the national interest, followed 18 months of public inquiry and would create a more sustainable local media industry where original content was paid for.  \u201cWe don\u2019t respond to coercion or heavy handed threats wherever they come from,\u201d Frydenberg said in an emailed response to Reuters\u2019 request for comment.  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Chair Rod Sims, who is overseeing the proposed law, said Facebook\u2019s response was \u201cill-timed and misconceived\u201d, and that the proposal \u201csimply aims to bring fairness and transparency to Facebook and Google\u2019s relationships with Australian news media businesses\u201d.  \u201cAs the ACCC and the Government work to finalise the draft legislation, we hope all parties will engage in constructive discussions,\u201d Sims said in a statement.  Bridget Fair, chief executive of Free TV Australia, a lobby group for free-to-air broadcasters, said Facebook\u2019s plan amounted to \u201cbullying\u201d and that the U.S. firm would \u201csay and do anything to avoid making a fair payment for news content\u201d.  \u201cAustralian Facebook users are being held to ransom as a tactic to intimidate the Australian government into backing down on this issue,\u201d she said in a statement.  FILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is displayed on a smartphone in this illustration taken January 6, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  The proposed law was \u201cthe only reasonable way to even up the bargaining power between Facebook, Google and Australian News Media Businesses,\u201d Fair said.  Facebook\u2019s Easton in his blog post called the proposed law \u201cunprecedented in its reach\u201d, and said the company could either remove news entirely or agree to pay publishers for as much content as they wanted at a price with no clear limits.  \u201cUnfortunately, no business can operate that way,\u201d he wrote.  Like in most countries, Australia\u2019s traditional media companies in recent years have seen their mainstay advertising income streams eroded by online competitors, and consumers shy away from paid subscription.  Last month, Google began an advertising campaign using pop-up ads on its main search page that said its free service would be \u201cat risk\u201d and users\u2019 personal data could be shared if the firm is made to pay news organisations for their content. The ACCC called the statements \u201cmisinformation\u201d.","301":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. payments processor PayPal Holdings Inc PYPL.O said on Friday it was leaving Libra Association, the entity managing the Facebook-led effort to build global digital currency Libra, making it the first member to exit the group.

FILE PHOTO: The Facebook logo is displayed on a mobile phone in this picture illustration taken December 2, 2019. REUTERS\/Johanna Geron\/Illustration\/File Photo  The move comes after U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg\u2019s campaign started paying popular meme accounts on Facebook-owned Instagram to post content as part of its social media offensive ahead of the 2020 election.  In tweets sent by Facebook director of product management Rob Leathern, the company said it had added a new column here to its free social media tracking tool CrowdTangle to show sponsored content for the presidential candidates.  Earlier this month, Facebook said it would allow U.S.-based political candidates to run sponsored content on its social networking platforms, but that the content would not be cataloged in its overall public ad library.  Bloomberg\u2019s campaign, which is running a highly-funded digital offensive to try and beat Republican President Donald Trump in November, has been working with a collective of influential meme-makers called Meme 2020 to post sponsored content on Instagram accounts over recent weeks.  In order to be shown in the new CrowdTangle column, influencers will have to use Facebook\u2019s branded content tool, which allows them to more clearly tag in an official sub-header that the post is a paid partnership.  Facebook said it had reached out to the Bloomberg campaign asking them to use this tool to properly disclose the posts.  \u201cWe don\u2019t have visibility into financial relationships taking place off our platforms, which is why we\u2019ve asked campaigns and creators to use our disclosure tools. On the broader topic of political branded content, we welcome clearer guidelines from regulators,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement.  The U.S. Federal Election Commission\u2019s rules do not explicitly address social media influencers, but it does say that public online communications advocating for the election or defeat of a candidate for a fee must include a disclaimer to inform who paid for the content.  The Federal Trade Commission requires social media influencers and content creators to clearly label sponsored posts.  \u201cWe push for maximum possible transparency across all of our content, and require that creators adhere to FTC disclosure requirements on sponsored content,\u201d said Sabrina Singh, a spokeswoman for the Bloomberg campaign.  \u201cWhenever possible, we push creators to use platform-specific branded content disclosure tools. However, basic business account tools are not made uniformly available to all Facebook and Instagram creators, so in those cases we require the FTC recommended copy disclosure.\u201d  Facebook\u2019s Leathern confirmed in a tweet that creators who have previously violated the company\u2019s community standards may not be eligible to use the branded disclosure tool.  Facebook also said it was looking at how to increase transparency for branded content run from private accounts. Facebook requires accounts to be public to run branded content, but said it knows some accounts then switch to private.  The tactic of paying influencers - people with large numbers of engaged social media followers - to spread political messages or make content is also gathering momentum among groups such as political action committees.  Other controversial online tactics by the Bloomberg campaign include hiring hundreds of digital organizers to send content on their own social media accounts, a practice that came under scrutiny last week when Twitter suspended a group of pro-Bloomberg accounts for violating its platform manipulation and spam policy.  The billionaire\u2019s team also recently posted an invitation on influencer marketplace Tribe, offering Bloomberg supporters a fixed fee of $150 to provide videos or images to the campaign.","306":"JAKARTA, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc\u2019s WhatsApp messenger service is globally limiting the number of times a user can forward a message to five, in a bid to fight \u201cmisinformation and rumours\u201d, company executives said on Monday.  \u201cWe\u2019re imposing a limit of five messages all over the world as of today,\u201d Victoria Grand, vice president for policy and communications at WhatsApp, said on Monday at an event in the Indonesian capital.

Michael Gwin, Deputy Rapid Response Director for the Biden campaign, told Reuters via email that this claim was false.  The Brookings Institute\u2019s Tax Policy Center, the Tax Foundation, and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget\u2014all independent public policy think tanks based in Washington, D.C.\u2014do not mention this alleged property tax proposal in their respective analyses of Biden\u2019s tax plan (available here , here , and here ).  Biden has not proposed a nationwide property tax. According to an outline of his plans, the former vice president would use taxes on the wealthy and corporations to pay for $3.2 trillion in promised investment in infrastructure, higher education and healthcare if he captures the White House. Biden has proposed paying for $750 billion in investments for both healthcare and higher education with other taxes that largely hit high-income earners, such as charging a higher rate on capital gains and dividends (here).  A report on Biden and President Donald Trump\u2019s clashing visions on taxes can be found here .  Contrary to what the posts suggest, the federal government does not collect property taxes. As explained www.usa.gov\/state-taxes by USA.gov , \u201cProperty taxes are typically collected by your state or local government. Your state establishes the guidelines under which local government can impose property taxes. Each of the 50 states has its own criteria for what property is taxable.\u201d  According to the Tax Policy Center, \u201cmost property tax revenue comes from local levies [\u2026] on land and improvements to it, but some states also tax personal property (such as machinery, equipment, and motor vehicles).\u201d (here)  Through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), however, the federal government does place taxes on capital gains (here). When the total sale price of a capital asset (such as a home, a car, or a stock investment), is greater than the original cost of that asset, the IRS collects a capital gains tax on that profit (here). Biden does plan to tax capital gains as ordinary income at a rate of 39.6% for individuals and couples earning over $1 million a year (here). But he has not proposed, as the posts claim, any kind of universal \u201cannual federal tax on your home.\u201d  Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (here), told Reuters via email that he was \u201cnot aware of any Biden policy which would impose a tax of that size and scope, directly or otherwise.\u201d  Goldwein explained that while there are certain \u201cprovisions that could indirectly increase taxes on the accrued values of homes for high earners [\u2026] none would apply to more than a small minority of homes.\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t see how any (of those provisions) \u2013 or even all together \u2013 would get to 3% of the value annually in any normal case,\u201d he said.  The Reuters Fact Check team previously debunked claims on social media that Biden had proposed a 13-percentage-point tax hike on families making $75,000 a year (here).  VERDICT  False.

Both inquiries were launched last month, Doyle said in the statement.  Facebook did not immediately respond when contacted by Reuters on Sunday.  The Telegraph, which first reported the inquiry, said Instagram made the email addresses and phone numbers of users under 18 public.  The Irish regulator launched its probe following a complaint by David Stier, a U.S. data scientist, the Telegraph added.  The first inquiry looks to establish if Facebook has the legal basis to process the data and whether it employs adequate protections and\/or restrictions on Instagram.  \u201cThis inquiry will also consider whether Facebook meets its obligations as a data controller with regard to transparency requirements in its provision of Instagram to children,\u201d Doyle said.

Stickers bearing the Facebook logo are pictured at Facebook Inc's F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S., April 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  But antitrust law makes such a proposal tough to execute because the government would have to take the company to court and win. It is rare to break up a company but not unheard of, with Standard Oil and AT&T being the two biggest examples.  Hughes\u2019 call to split Facebook from WhatsApp and Instagram followed a March pledge by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination for the 2020 election, to break up big tech companies.  Facebook rejected Hughes\u2019 call for a breakup.  \u201cAccountability of tech companies can only be achieved through the painstaking introduction of new rules for the internet. That is exactly what Mark Zuckerberg has called for,\u201d Nick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global affairs and communications, said in an emailed statement.  What is Hughes\u2019 argument?  Hughes called for the Federal Trade Commission, working with the Justice Department, to force Facebook to undo its purchases of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. He said the three could become separate publicly traded companies. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives would be required to divest management shares.  Hughes\u2019 criticisms of Facebook focused on its massive power over speech, and the fact that it was a tool that Russia used to manipulate U.S. voters in 2016 with false news reports. He also expressed concern that Zuckerberg had outsized power in such a dominant firm, saying: \u201cMark is a good, kind person. But I\u2019m angry that his focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks.\u201d  How could a breakup happen?  To force a company to break up, the government would have to file a lawsuit demonstrating that the firm has market power in the industry and that the deal has hurt consumers by pushing up prices or reducing product quality.  This could be particularly hard in the case of Facebook or other technology companies, especially those that provide a free service to users.  \u201cThe case law as it stands today would make the structural breakup of any of these companies very challenging,\u201d an antitrust expert based in Washington said.  It is rare for the government to seek to break up an existing company, but it has been done.  Famously, the United States sued to break up Standard Oil, accusing it of being an abusive monopoly. The case was fought all the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled in 1911 that the company should be broken up.  In 1974, the U.S. government filed an antitrust lawsuit against AT&T Corp because it had a monopoly on telephone lines. After eight years of litigation, the two sides reached a settlement that led to AT&T giving up control of its regional operating companies, or Baby Bells.  Perhaps the most famous case is the government\u2019s effort to break up Microsoft. The Justice Department won a preliminary victory in 2000 but was reversed on appeal. The case settled with Microsoft intact.  There are recent examples with smaller companies.  The Justice Department forced consumer review website Bazaarvoice Inc to undo a 2012 merger with rival PowerReviews in 2014.  The FTC this week won a victory in trying to break up a merger of two prosthetic knee makers: Otto Bock HealthCare North America, Inc and Freedom Innovations. An administrative law judge ruled in its favor on May 6.  What about privacy issues?  U.S. lawmakers are also considering privacy legislation that would weaken companies like Facebook by reducing the amount of personal user data they control, thus reducing their value to advertisers.  Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat, said in April that the was considering legislation that would focus on data portability, so users of one social media could take their information from one site to another.  How powerful is Facebook?  Congress held a series of hearings last year looking at the dominance of major tech companies, including their considerable political heft.  Facebook has huge global reach, with 1.56 billion users daily as of March. It had 37,700 full-time employees as of the end of March spread around offices in 20 U.S. cities and dozens more around the world.  Tech companies are among the biggest U.S. political donors. Google spent $21 million to lobby in 2018 while Amazon spent $14.2 million and Facebook spent $12.62 million, according to their filings to U.S. Congress.","321":"Aug 11 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc will make the metrics of its content enforcement report available for external auditors to conduct an independent audit, the social network said on Tuesday.

The company said it would message affected users over the coming days to tell them what type of information had been accessed in the attack.  The breach has left users more vulnerable to targeted phishing attacks and could deepen unease about posting to a service whose privacy, moderation and security practices have been called into question by a series of scandals, cybersecurity experts and financial analysts said.  The attackers took profile details such as birth dates, employers, education history, religious preference, types of devices used, pages followed and recent searches and location check-ins from 14 million users.  For the other 15 million users, the breach was restricted to name and contact details. In addition, attackers could see the posts and lists of friends and groups of about 400,000 users.  Lawmakers and investors have grown more concerned that Facebook is not doing enough to safeguard data.  The company\u2019s shares rose 0.25 percent on Friday as Wall Street rebounded after a six-day losing streak. The Nasdaq composite index gained 2.29 percent.  Facebook cut the number of affected users from its original estimate after investigators reviewed activity on accounts that may have been affected. Still, cyber security experts warned that attackers could use stolen information in targeted phishing scams.  \u201cThe bottom line is that all this data is still out there,\u201d said Corey Milligan, a senior researcher with cyber-security firm Armor Inc.  Figurines are seen in front of the Facebook logo in this illustration taken March 20, 2018.

Rosen revealed that while the attackers\u2019 intent has not been determined, they did not appear to be motivated by the upcoming U.S. mid-term Congressional election on Nov. 6.  He said the attack affected a \u201cbroad\u201d spectrum of users, but declined to break down the number affected by country.  Facebook said it was continuing to investigate whether the attackers took actions beyond stealing data, such as posting from accounts, but had not found additional misuse.  Hackers did not steal personal messages or financial data and did not use their access to accounts to access users\u2019 accounts on other websites, Facebook said.  A FOCUS ON TRUST  Rosen said the company would \u201cdo everything we can to earn users\u2019 trust.\u201d  The company previously warned that profits would suffer because of breach-related expenses.  The vulnerability the hackers exploited existed from July 2017 through late last month, when Facebook noticed an unusual increase in the use of its \u201cview as\u201d feature.  That feature allows users to check privacy settings by glimpsing what their profile looks like to others. But three errors in Facebook\u2019s software enabled someone accessing \u201cview as\u201d to post and browse from the Facebook account of the other user.  The attackers used the \u201cview as\u201d flaw with \u201ca small handful\u201d of accounts they controlled to capture data of their Facebook friends, then used a tool they developed to breach friends of friends and beyond, Rosen said.  Facebook patched the issue last month and asked 90 million users to log back into their accounts, many just as a precaution.  Security experts have said Facebook\u2019s initial breach disclosure arrived earlier than it likely would have prior to the enactment in May of the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which mandates notification within 72 hours of learning of a compromise.  Facebook\u2019s lead EU data regulator, the Irish data protection commissioner, last week opened an investigation into the breach. Authorities in other jurisdictions including the U.S. states of Connecticut and New York are also looking into the attack.  Regulators around the world have ongoing inquiries into another matter that came to light in March: How profile details from 87 million Facebook users were improperly accessed by political data firm Cambridge Analytica.

HUNTER BIDEN  During the 2020 campaign for the White House, Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden became a focus of attacks from former President Donald Trump and his Republican allies, who questioned potential conflicts of interest from Hunter\u2019s position on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma at the time his father was vice president to Democratic President Barack Obama (here).  As Reuters reported in October 2019, interviews with more than a dozen people, including executives and former prosecutors in Ukraine, paint a picture of Hunter Biden as a director who provided advice on legal issues, corporate finance and strategy during his five-year term on the board, which ended in April of 2019 (here).  They also said his presence on the board did not protect the company from criminal investigations launched by Ukrainian authorities against its owner, Mykola Zlochevsky. The allegations concerned tax violations, money-laundering and licenses given to Burisma during the period when Zlochevsky was a minister.  In June 2020, an audit of thousands of old case files by Ukrainian prosecutors found no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Hunter Biden (here).

As reported by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Henry John Heinz IV \u201chas maintained the lowest public profile of the three brothers over the years,\u201d working as a blacksmith in Bucks County, Pennsylvania (here).  Christopher Heinz currently serves on the Heinz Endowment\u2019s board of directors (here). According to the Center for a New American Security, a Washington, D.C. thinktank where he is on the board of advisers, he was formerly senior vice president at PNC Bank and \u201cthe leader of its external Fintech investment program and strategy development\u201d (here).  Andre Heinz is an environmentalist (here) and the current chairman of Heinz Endowments (here), and co-founder of the Sustainable Technologies Fund, a cleantech venture fund in Sweden (obvious.com\/team\/andre-heinz).  Claims that a son of John Kerry is involved in a Ukrainian energy company likely have origins in Christopher Heinz\u2019s former business partnership with Hunter Biden. As explained here by Reuters, Christopher Heinz joined Hunter Biden and Devon Archer, one of his classmates at Yale University, in co-founding financial services company Rosemont Seneca Partners in 2009.  In 2012, Hunter Biden and Archer talked to Chinese private equity investor Jonathan Li about joining forces on a fund that would invest Chinese capital - and possibly capital from other countries - outside of China, the New Yorker magazine reported in a profile of Hunter Biden in July 2019 (here).  Li, Archer and others agreed in 2013 to establish the fund, called BHR Partners, and Hunter Biden joined as an unpaid member of the board, the New Yorker said.  An archived version of BHR\u2019s website from 2014 says BHR was formed in 2013 by two Chinese asset managers alongside Rosemont Seneca Partners and Thornton Group LLC.  A spokesperson for Christopher Heinz told The Hill in March 2018 that Heinz had \"no operating role\" in Rosemont Seneca, and that he had no involvement in any of the firm's dealings in China (here).  By mentioning \u201cJohn Kerry\u2019s son,\u201d the social media posts likely conflate Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine with his establishment of BHR Partners, a fund linked to an investment firm that Heinz co-founded but is no longer part of.  As reported here by the Washington Post in September 2019, Archer and Biden\u2019s decision to join the board of Burisma in 2014 \u201craised serious concerns\u201d for Christopher Heinz, \u201cwho told Archer that joining Burisma was a bad idea\u201d due to \u201creports of corruption in Ukraine, geopolitical risks and general questions about appearance.\u201d  Chris Bastardi, a spokesperson for Heinz, told the Post that Heinz \u201cstrongly warned Mr. Archer that working with Burisma was unacceptable,\u201d and that the move \u201cwas a major catalyst for Mr. Heinz ending his business relationships with Mr. Archer and Mr. Biden.\u201d  Reuters did not receive a response to its request for comment from Kerry\u2019s communications team.  MITT ROMNEY\u2019S SONS  Republican Senator Mitt Romney has five sons: Tagg, Matt, Josh, Ben and Craig Romney (here).  Tagg is the co-founder of Solamere Capital, a Boston-based private equity investment firm where he serves as managing partner (here). Matt is a managing director at a Salt Lake City real estate firm called Sundance Bay (here). Josh is the president and founder of the Romney group, a real estate investment company in Salt Lake City ( here , here ). Ben is a radiologist in Murray, Utah (here). Craig is the director of asset management for Sundance Bay (here).  Reuters could not find an explanation for posts linking any of Romney\u2019s sons to an energy company doing business in Ukraine.  When reached for comment, Arielle Mueller, press secretary for Senator Romney, told Reuters via email: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on fake news from random internet trolls.\u201d  VERDICT  Partly false. Though Hunter Biden formerly sat on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma, he no longer does. The sons\/stepsons of Nancy Pelosi, John Kerry and Mitt Romney are not, and have not been, board members of energy companies doing business in Ukraine.

FILE PHOTO: Small toy figures are seen on representations of virtual currency in front of the Libra logo in this illustration picture, June 21, 2019. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  Mu Changchun, deputy director of the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s payments department, said the development of the coin would help protect country\u2019s foreign exchange sovereignty as commercial applications of such currencies expanded.  \u201cWhy is the central bank still doing such a digital currency today when electronic payment methods are so developed?\u201d said Mu, according to a transcript of a lecture he gave this week that was published online.  \u201cIt is to protect our monetary sovereignty and legal currency status. We need to plan ahead for a rainy day.\u201d  He said the tokens would be as safe as central bank-issued paper notes and could be used even without an internet connection. They could also be used on Tencent's 0700.HK WeChat and Alibaba-backed BABA.N Alipay.  The state-run newspaper Shanghai Securities News reported his comments on Friday.  China\u2019s central bank set up a research team in 2014 to explore launching its own digital currency to cut the costs of circulating traditional paper money and boost policymakers\u2019 control of money supply.  It had said little since but Mu last month announced that the digital currency was almost ready. U.S. financial magazine Forbes, citing sources, said the currency could be ready as soon as Nov. 11.  Some analysts say China appears to have accelerated the push to digital money after U.S. social media giant Facebook FB.O announced plans in June to launch digital coin Libra.  Mu said China\u2019s digital currency would strike a balance between allowing anonymous payments and preventing money-laundering. It would also bear some similarities to Libra in design but would not be a direct copy, he said without elaborating.  Facebook\u2019s proposed cryptocurrency has sparked concerns among global regulators that it could quickly become a dominant form of digital payment and a channel for money laundering given the social network\u2019s massive cross-border reach.  Libra will be a digital currency backed by a reserve of real-world assets, including bank deposits and short-term government securities, and held by a network of custodians. Its structure is intended to foster trust and stabilize the price.  Like other cryptocurrencies, Libra transactions will be powered and recorded by a blockchain, which is a shared ledger of transactions maintained by a network of computers.  Mu said the advantage a central bank-issued digital coin had over those issued by WeChat and Alipay was that commercial platforms could in theory go bankrupt which could cause users losses. Its ability to be used without an internet connection would also allow transactions to continue in situations in which communications have broken down, such as an earthquake.","332":"LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Facebook has bumped up the star wattage for this week\u2019s livestreaming \u201c#Graduation2020\u201d virtual commencement festivities.

The DPC, Facebook\u2019s lead EU regulator, already has eight individual probes into the U.S. social media giant, plus two into its WhatsApp subsidiary and one into Facebook-owned Instagram.  \u201cFurther to our ongoing engagement with Google, Apple and Microsoft in relation to the processing of personal data in the context of the manual transcription of audio recordings, we are now seeking detailed information from Facebook on the processing in question and how Facebook believes that such processing of data is compliant with their GDPR obligations,\u201d the commission said in an emailed statement.  Under the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) privacy rules, regulators have the power to impose fines for violations of up to 4% of a company\u2019s global revenue or 20 million euros ($22 million), whichever is higher.  Democratic U.S. Senator Ed Markey said on Twitter that \u201cit\u2019s appalling to learn that Facebook has been collecting and sharing audio recordings of its users.\u201d He added the company \u201cshould stop altogether and pledge never to resume invading users\u2019 privacy in this manner.\u201d  Republican Senator Josh Hawley questioned if the practice violates the terms of Facebook\u2019s $5 billion proposed consent decree privacy settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.  Facebook until recently carried out human review of private audio from its Messenger app in order to improve artificial intelligence systems to transcribe accurately but no EU users were affected, the company said on Wednesday.  The audio snippets in question were masked to avoid revealing anyone\u2019s identity and the company never listened to people\u2019s microphones without explicit activation, a representative said in an email, adding the practice was common in the industry.  \u201cMuch like Apple and Google, we paused human review of audio more than a week ago,\u201d the representative said. Facebook has faced broad criticism from lawmakers and regulators over its privacy practices and received renewed criticism after Bloomberg on Tuesday reported that Facebook used outside contractors to transcribe the clips.","334":"LONDON (Reuters) - Facebook FB.O came under fire on Tuesday from lawmakers from several countries who accused the firm of undermining democratic institutions and left out an empty chair for chief executive Mark Zuckerberg after he declined to be questioned.

Concerns over the social media giant\u2019s practices, the role of political adverts and possible foreign interference in the 2016 Brexit vote and U.S. elections are among the topics being investigated by British and European regulators.  \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything quite like Facebook, where, while we were playing on our phones and apps, our democratic institutions ... seem to have been upended by frat-boy billionaires from California,\u201d Canadian lawmaker Charlie Angus said at a special international hearing at Britain\u2019s parliament.  \u201cSo Mr Zuckerberg\u2019s decision not to appear here at Westminster (Britain\u2019s parliament) to me speaks volumes,\u201d he said, later suggesting Facebook could be broken up to help address the issues.  Facebook says it complies with EU data protection laws, but Richard Allan, the company\u2019s vice president of policy solutions who appeared in Zuckerberg\u2019s stead, admitted it had made mistakes.  \u201cI\u2019m not going to disagree with you that we\u2019ve damaged public trust through some of the actions we\u2019ve taken,\u201d Allan told the hearing.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  RUSSIAN IP  The 24 representatives from nine countries, who demanded answers from Facebook over its use and treatment of data, posed for a picture with an empty chair behind a desk with a nameplate for Zuckerberg on it.  Facebook has faced a barrage of criticism from users and lawmakers after it said last year that Russian agents used its platform to spread disinformation before and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election, an accusation Moscow denies.  Legal documents reviewed by Reuters show how the investigation by British lawmakers has led them to seize documents relating to Facebook from app developer Six4Three, which is in a legal dispute with Facebook.  Damian Collins, chair of the culture committee which convened the hearing, said he would not release those documents on Tuesday as he was not in a position to do so, although he has said previously the committee has the legal power to.  However, he did refer to one item in the documents, alleging a Facebook engineer had \u201cnotified the company in October 2014 that entities with Russian IP addresses have been using a Pinterest API key to pull over 3 billion data points a day.\u201d  API refers to Application Programming Interfaces, which have been restricted by Facebook in light of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  Allan said the documents were \u201ca partial set of information that was obtained by a hostile litigant.\u201d  \u201cAny information that you have seen that\u2019s contained within that cache of emails is at best partial and at worst potentially misleading,\u201d he said.  In a separate response to the issue raised by Collins, Facebook in a statement said \u201cthe engineers who had flagged these initial concerns subsequently looked into this further and found no evidence of specific Russian activity\u201d.","335":"LONDON (Reuters) - Facebook\u2019s proposed Libra cryptocurrency falls into a \u201cbig gap\u201d in European Union financial regulation at a time when the bloc\u2019s ability to tackle money laundering is already stretched, a top EU regulator said on Thursday.  FILE PHOTO: Small toy figures are seen on representations of virtual currency in front of the Libra logo in this illustration picture, June 21, 2019. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  Jose Manuel Campa, chair of the European Banking Authority (EBA) said it was necessary to \u201ckeep an eye\u201d on cryptoassets like Libra. The watchdog had issued investor warnings before Libra was even mooted that cryptoassets could be channels for money laundering activities, he said.  Explaining that financial assets are covered by EU investment laws while electronic payments came under payments rules, Campa told the European Parliament\u2019s economic affairs committee: \u201cThere is a big gap in between where most of these assets fall.\u201d  An assessment of Libra so far indicated it would be \u201cin that big gap\u201d, he added.  Stopping money laundering has shot up the agenda in Europe after a spate of scandals at banks, including Danske Bank DANSKE.CO. Denmark's biggest lender has admitted to having handled 200 billion euros of suspicious transactions through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.  There is no consensus within the 28-country EU for a standalone agency to crack down on money-laundering, leaving enforcement to national authorities that have wide discretion and differing approaches.  This left the EBA looking like a poorly resourced \u201cpaper tiger\u201d, only able to issue guidelines to national regulators, lawmakers said on Thursday.  The Paris-based agency has just three staff working on ensuring that national authorities comply with EU anti money-laundering rules, with another eight due to be added over the next three years, Campa said.  \u201cWe have very limited resources,\u201d Campa said.  But lawmakers slammed a decision by national supervisors in April to effectively clear financial regulators in Estonia and Denmark over potential legal breaches in how they applied EU money laundering rules in relation to Danske Bank.  \u201cThat EBA is able to conclude no breach in union (EU) law is really a scandal from my point of view. We need a strong EBA,\u201d said Niels Fuglsang, a Danish member of the committee.  Campa said the EBA board was looking at how to make better use of its \u201cbreach of union law\u201d procedure, which proved less effective in historic cases like at Danske Bank.  An official from the European Commission told lawmakers that the EU executive could bring its own EU Treaty violation case in relation to Danske case.  \u201cThings have not been concluded. We are still analyzing that matter,\u201d she said.","336":"March 29 (Reuters) - New York AG Schneiderman  * NEW YORK AG SCHNEIDERMAN SAYS TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE COMPANIES LIKE FACEBOOK TO PROVIDE NOTIFICATION IF USERS\u2019 PERSONAL INFO IS MISUSED  * NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL SCHNEIDERMAN SAYS URGED THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO PASS HIS STOP HACKS AND IMPROVE ELECTRONIC DATA SECURITY ACT  * N.Y.

At least 16 brokerages cut their price targets on Facebook after Chief Financial Officer David Wehner startled an otherwise routine call with analysts by saying the company faced a multi-year squeeze on its business margins.  That \u201cbombshell,\u201d as one analyst termed it, played into concerns on Wall Street that Facebook\u2019s model could be under threat after a year dominated by efforts to head off concerns over privacy and its role in global news flow.

In a statement, it said it had already made significant changes to its terms of service and data protection guidelines since the case was first brought in 2015.  \u201cWe are working hard to ensure that our guidelines are clear and easy to understand, and that the services offered by Facebook are in full accordance with the law,\u201d Facebook said.  Further, Facebook would in the meantime update its data protection guidelines and its terms of service so that they comply with new European Union-wide rules that are due to enter force in June.  Facebook, which counts more than 2 billion users worldwide, already faces scrutiny from Germany\u2019s competition authorities over its handling of its users\u2019 personal data.  The Federal Cartel Office, in an interim update on an investigation into Facebook, said in December that it objected to the way the company gains access to third-party data when an account is opened.  This includes tapping information from its own WhatsApp and Instagram products - as well as how it tracks which sites its users access.  One concern highlighted by the consumer rights group was that, in Facebook\u2019s app for smartphones, a service was pre-activated that revealed the user\u2019s location to the person they were chatting to.  Also, in the privacy settings, ticks were already placed in boxes that allowed search engines to link to the user\u2019s timeline, meaning that anyone would be able quickly and easily to find a user\u2019s profile.  \u201cThe judges ruled that all five of the default settings on Facebook that vzvb complained about are invalid,\u201d the group said in a statement, adding that several other of Facebook\u2019s terms of use were found to be illegal.","344":"(Corrects to say fine is first this year, not ever)  BRASILIA, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Brazil\u2019s Ministry of Justice said on Monday it has fined U.S. tech giant Facebook Inc 6.6 million reais ($1.64 million) for improperly sharing user data.

In a blog post on Friday, the social media company also said it would conduct a review of all Facebook events related to the inauguration and take down events that violated its rules.  The move follows violence in Washington, D.C., last Wednesday when supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol following weeks of increased violent rhetoric and organizing on social media sites.  The FBI has warned of armed protests being planned for Washington and all 50 state capitals in the run-up to Jan. 20.

The report said the communications \u201cappear to show Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s connection to potentially problematic privacy practices at the company\u201d. Shares of the Menlo Park, California-based company were down 1.8% at $174.9 in early afternoon trading.  The emails have raised concerns within the company that they could be a public relations problem, at least, for Facebook, the WSJ reported, citing one of the people familiar with the matter.  The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been investigating allegations that Facebook inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.  The FTC and the Department of Justice, which enforce antitrust laws in the United States, are also gearing up to investigate whether tech giants Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Facebook and Alphabet\u2019s Google misuse their massive market power.  The company\u2019s move to reach a speedy settlement of the FTC investigation is in part because of the emails, according to the WSJ report. The Journal said it could not determine what emails the FTC has requested and how many of them relate to Zuckerberg.  Facebook said it has fully cooperated with the FTC investigation till date and provided tens of thousands of documents, emails and files.  \u201cFacebook and its executives, including Mark, at all times strive to comply with all applicable law, and at no point did Mark or any other Facebook employee knowingly violate the company\u2019s obligations under the FTC consent order,\u201d a company spokesman said in an email.  The company has previously said it is preparing to pay as much as $5 billion in a settlement with U.S. regulators.

The company said users will be able to integrate their Instagram accounts with Facebook\u2019s dating profile and add Instagram followers to their \u201cSecret Crush\u201d lists. That feature allows users to indicate romantic interest in a friend, without the attraction becoming public. If two friends each tag the other as a crush, Facebook Dating alerts both of the interest.  The service would be optional for Facebook and Instagram users, the company said, adding that dating activity of users will not appear on their profile or news feed.  The service will be available only to users aged 18 and over, who can decide who gets to see their dating profile, Facebook said.  The launch marks a major expansion of Facebook\u2019s dating service, initially rolled out in Colombia, Thailand, Canada, Argentina and Mexico last year.  It also opens the company to further scrutiny of its privacy and safety record, which has caught the attention of regulators around the world after years of scandals over its handling of personal information.  Facebook offers safety guidelines to people who sign up for a Dating profile and notes in the liability section of its terms of service that it does not conduct background checks or sex offender register searches.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  \u201cYou interact with other users at your own risk,\u201d the terms state.  Fidji Simo, who recently took over leadership of the core Facebook app, said at the company\u2019s annual F8 developer conference in May that the service was expanding into 14 new countries in Asia and Latin America and would be available in the United States by the end of the year.  She also introduced the new Secret Crush feature, which allows users to express romantic interest in nine of their Facebook friends or Instagram followers. Dating profiles are separate from those other services, but use their data to identify Secret Crush matches.  The expansion poses a threat to competitor dating apps, which have long similarly relied on data from connected Facebook accounts to identify possible connections between users.  Facebook, with its 2.1 billion daily active users, dwarfs the scale of those apps. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in 2018 that 200 million Facebook users listed themselves as single.  Leading competitor Match Group MTCH.O, which operates Tinder, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish and other dating apps in 190 countries, has about 50 million daily users, according to a Refinitiv estimate.  Shares of Match Group were down nearly 6% on the news. Match's parent IAC IAC.O was down more than 3%.  Facebook expects to launch the dating service in Europe by early 2020, in addition to the 20 countries where it is presently available.","348":"WASHINGTON - April 30 (Reuters) - Christopher Wray, prior to becoming FBI director, argued on behalf of Facebook Inc in defense of encrypted communications as the company was being pressured by the U.S. Justice Department over the issue, according to a court filing and a person familiar with the case.  Wray\u2019s work as an attorney about five years ago appears to be at odds with the international push by the Justice Department and U.S. allies to allow law enforcement and intelligence agencies to bypass encrypted communications.  Wray himself has been a very public part of that campaign, arguing that finding a way around encryption was key to the fight against terrorism and serious crime.  Only last month, Wray told a cybersecurity conference that internet companies were \u201cincreasingly shielding indispensable information about those threats from any form of lawful access -through warrant-proof encryption.\u201d  Wray\u2019s work for Facebook, which occurred when he was employed as a lawyer for law firm King and Spalding, has not been previously reported.  The FBI said Wray could not comment on the case.  \u201cWhen he was an attorney in private practice, however, the Director represented his clients\u2019 interests and advocated on their behalf,\u201d the agency said in a statement.  \u201cLike all other lawyers, his duty of loyalty was to his client, and he did not put his personal views ahead of his clients\u2019 interests or allow them to affect the legal work he did for clients. Today, as Director of the FBI, his duty is to act in the best interests of the American people,\u201d it said.  Many details of the 2015-2016 case, which addressed U.S. attempts to influence Facebook\u2019s encryption plans, remain sealed. The case took place as Facebook-owned WhatsApp communication service was implementing strong encryption for all its users.  A limited amounted of information about it was released by Facebook in a court filing related to a different matter involving its lawsuit against Israeli cyber arms dealer NSO Group.  In that lawsuit being heard in California, Facebook has accused NSO of hacking its users through a now fixed flaw in WhatsApp.  The new court documents released late on Wednesday argue that King & Spalding should not be allowed to represent NSO Group because the firm\u2019s past representation of WhatsApp \u201cnecessarily involved the provision and exchange of WhatsApp\u2019s highly confidential information.\u201d  The documents do not specify what the past representation entailed - saying only that it occurred as WhatsApp was implementing its encryption protections. A person familiar with the case said it involved an attempt by the U.S. Department of Justice to pressure WhatsApp over the use of encryption.  NSO denies wrongdoing in that case. King & Spalding declined to comment.  In a statement, WhatsApp did not comment specifically on Wray\u2019s past position on encryption, but said that King & Spalding\u2019s past work for WhatsApp poses \u201cserious ethical concerns for their representation of NSO today.\u201d (Reporting by Christopher Bing and Raphael Satter; Editing by Bill Berkrot)","349":"BRUSSELS, Sept 12 (Reuters) - The European Commission will propose new laws on Wednesday giving Google, Facebook , Twitter and other internet companies one hour to remove extremist content or face fines.  The Commission told such companies in March that they had three months to show they were removing extremist content more rapidly or face legislation forcing them to do so.  The Commission wants content inciting or advocating extremist offences, promoting extremist groups, or showing how to commit such acts to be removed from the web within a hour of receiving a corresponding order from national authorities.  In a proposal that will need backing from EU countries and the European Parliament, internet platforms will also be required to take proactive measures, such as developing new tools to weed out abuse and human oversight of content.  Service providers will have to provide annual transparency reports to show their efforts in tackling abuse.  Providers systematically failing to remove extremist content could face fines of up to 4 percent of annual global turnover. Content providers will though have the right to challenge removal orders.  In turn, it asks national governments to put in place the capacity to identify extremist content online, sanctions, and an appeals procedure.  The industry has also been working since December 2015 in a voluntary partnership to stop the misuse of the internet by international extremist groups, later creating a \u201cdatabase of hashes\u201d to better detect extremist content.  The Commission will retain a voluntary code of conduct on hate speech with Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube in 2016. Other companies have since announced plans to join it.

A statement from La Liga said all 380 league matches for the new season, which begins on Friday, would be available to viewers in India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Pakistan.  \u201cWe are really happy to be on a free to air service in such an important territory as the Indian sub-continent,\u201d Alfredo Bermejo, La Liga\u2019s head of digital strategy, told Reuters ahead of the announcement.  \u201cOne of our goals for the last two years has been to offer content to the widest audience possible, so partnering with free platforms like Facebook, which has 270 million users in India, is key to us.\u201d  Facebook and La Liga declined to give financial details of the deal which sees the social network giant unseat Sony Pictures Network as the rights holder in the region.  Sony paid a reported $32 million for the right to broadcast La Liga between 2014 and 2018.  Facebook began venturing into sports streaming in 2017 by broadcasting weekly Major League Baseball games and earlier this month agreed a deal with broadcaster Eleven Sports to show one La Liga and one Serie A game per week on its platform.  The deal with La Liga is the latest statement of the growing interest of tech groups in showing sports in order to keep young viewers on their platforms.

REUTERS\/Mark Blinch  WASHINGTON\/NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Google and Facebook have made their quarterly case for a watchdog. The search engine\u2019s parent, Alphabet, reported soaring sales and profit just days after Facebook\u2019s blowout earnings. Concerns about fake news and the wanton commercialization of consumer data have done little to clip their dominance of online advertising. It\u2019s all the more reason for regulatory oversight.  Alphabet\u2019s revenue rose 22 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 from the same period the previous year. The company\u2019s digital advertising business continues to go gangbusters. Revenue from that part of the business rose 20 percent year over year, and accounted for over 80 percent of the company\u2019s total revenue.  This mirrors the results at Facebook, where notwithstanding an astonishing amount of public and press ire against the company and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, revenue increased 30 percent in the fourth quarter, to $16.9 billion, and monthly active users increased 9 percent, to 2.3 billion people. Furthermore, both companies continued to throw off astonishing amounts of cash even as they increased spending on futuristic ventures ranging from therapies to defeat aging-related illnesses to virtual reality.  It\u2019s telling to contrast the replicating, machine-like growth of these firms and their profitability with the increasingly dire public perception. Stories emerge nearly weekly about Google and Facebook\u2019s efforts to strip-mine personal information to sell advertising.  Yet market forces to topple the twin powers seem futile, or at least a long way from succeeding. Consider that fellow FAANG Amazon, which also has a fast-growing ad business, is nowhere near sapping their strength. Canaccord Genuity figures only 1 percent of Google\u2019s search revenue is vulnerable to the competitive risk from Jeff Bezos\u2019 firm. The idea of a startup eclipsing the two giants seems even more far-fetched in light of recent jobs cuts at Vice Media, BuzzFeed and Verizon Media, all of which depend on online ad sales.  Google and Facebook\u2019s domination of search and social media, their profits from internet advertising, the data they have collected, and the infrastructure they have created make it hard to see anything \u2013 outside regulation \u2013 curbing either company over the next several years. Given their deep wells of consumer information, this also sets them up nicely to rule the next wave of internet things to come.","356":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc FB.O ad sales appear to have ticked up since late March, offering investors reason for optimism even as decimated advertising budgets from the coronavirus are expected to weigh heavily on first-quarter earnings, according to data from firms that track online ads.  FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen placed on a keyboard in this illustration taken March 25, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  Analysts on average expect Facebook on Wednesday to report 16.1% growth in first-quarter revenue, its lowest since the company went public in 2012, according to Refinitiv data.  The estimates were revised down by about $1 billion since January to reflect a plunge in demand for ads for travel, restaurants and other shuttered consumer services because of the global coronavirus pandemic.  But data from digital marketing agency Gupta Media indicates that the volume of ads shown on Facebook doubled late in the quarter as usage surged, even as prices declined by about half to $1.08 per thousand impressions at the end of March from $2.17 at the beginning.  That balance suggests Facebook\u2019s revenues held steady in March even as global markets cratered in response to the spread of the virus, said Gogi Gupta, whose agency tracks a global sample of more than 5 billion ad impressions on Facebook\u2019s core social network as well as Instagram, Messenger and Audience Network, which serves ads on other websites and apps.  Volumes continued to increase in early April, up 15% from the second half of March, while prices stabilized, Gupta said.  Gupta\u2019s thesis is supported by data from Socialbakers, another marketing firm, which shows that ad spending in East Asia has risen 12.7% since early March as the region\u2019s economies came back online.  A third firm, Pathmatics, said the top advertisers it tracks spent more on Facebook in recent weeks than at the start of the pandemic - $166 million in the second half of March, up from $114 million in the first half of February.  Much of that boost came from Walt Disney Co DIS.N alone, whose spending surged on Facebook in late March to about $50 million, the data showed.  All three data firms measure only a sliver of Facebook\u2019s total advertising, they cautioned. They also track big brands and do not account for the long tail of small businesses that comprise much of Facebook\u2019s 8 million-strong advertiser base, many of them buckling under the mass closures in response to the pandemic.  Still, the trend line looks positive for Facebook, putting it in step with other online ad players like Alphabet Inc's Google GOOGL.O and Snap Inc SNAP.N, which handily beat revenue estimates in early showings this earnings season.  Analysts expect Twitter Inc, TWTR.N, which reports on Thursday, to fare the worst of the bunch. They forecast a 1.4% year-over-year decline in revenue, given its reliance on ads for product launches and in-person events, many of which are canceled.  Twitter pulled its guidance for the quarter in late March.","357":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google disclosed in a quarterly filing on Tuesday that it spent a company-record $21.2 million on lobbying the U.S. government in 2018, topping its previous high of $18.22 million in 2012, as the search engine operator fights wide-ranging scrutiny into its practices.

Reuters-Facebook Journalism Project - Identifying and Tackling Manipulated Media Course  The \u2018Identifying and Tackling Manipulated Media\u2019 course encompasses real world examples, hypothetical cases and insights into the evolving technology used to create and detect manipulated media. The course aims to combat these risks by teaching journalists about the various types of altered media including the growing threat of the \u2018deepfake\u2019 and the ways in which newsrooms can be better equipped to handle this type of misinformation in order to move forward with confidence to verify and publish genuine content from third-party sources. It is now available in English, French, Spanish and Arabic, with more languages to launch in 2020.  The spread of inaccurate and misleading information is a significant and growing global problem. It is a major challenge for journalists and a source of alarm for governments, institutions and individuals all over the world, as it has had an increasing impact on elections. Some of the most powerful and effective forms of misinformation are video and images, as they are highly shared on social media and can be understood by all. Staged events, recycled video, deceptive editing, tampering and the recent rise of AI-driven \u2018deepfakes\u2019 videos all pose a fundamental threat to an informed democracy.  This type of misinformation has become a major challenge for journalists who strive to determine facts surrounding complex and often emotionally-charged topics. Reuters has been at the forefront of addressing this growing threat, with a specialist team of editors dedicated to authentication of user generated content. The team frequently encounters media that has been taken out of context, mislabeled, edited, staged or manipulated with CGI, and has been leading the charge in raising awareness and educating journalists around the world.  Audiences, too, are aware of the growing risk: a recent Reuters Institute study found more than half (55%) of people around the world are concerned about their ability to separate what is real and fake on the internet. News organizations can play an important role in allaying their audiences\u2019 concerns by being able to identify manipulated or misleading media themselves.  \u201cOrganizations around the world are increasingly alarmed by the spread and impact of misinformation on society. It\u2019s become a major challenge for media organizations as they\u2019re bombarded with user-generated and other third-party content,\u201d said Jess April, Director Strategic Partnerships & Program Management, Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s a threat we at Reuters encounter every day, and this new course puts that expertise into practice to educate journalists and newsroom about identifying manipulated media to help stop the spread of misinformation. Providing trusted news and intelligence to the world is at the heart of what we do and sharing our knowledge of this growing threat is critical to that mission.\u201d  \u201cWe need to work across industries to better identify and address manipulated media. Partnering with Reuters to launch this free e-learning course is an important step to help journalists spot this type of content so we can stop the spread of misinformation online,\u201d said Julia Bain, Facebook Integrity Partnerships.

The country\u2019s Personal Information Protection Commission, launched in August this year, said in a statement it fined Facebook after a probe found that the personal information of least 3.3 million of the 18 million Facebook users in Korea were provided to operators other than Facebook without their knowledge, from May 2012 to June 2018.  When someone uses another operator\u2019s service through Facebook\u2019s log-in, the personal information of the user\u2019s Facebook friends were provided to other operators without their consent, the commission said.

India is WhatsApp\u2019s biggest market with over 200 million users. But false information on its app this year has contributed toward the triggering of mass beatings of more than a dozen people, at least three of whom have died.  On Sunday, five more people were lynched in the western state of Maharashtra on suspicion of being child abductors.  The rise in such incidents prompted the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology on Tuesday to ask WhatsApp to take immediate steps to prevent the circulation of false information and provocative content.  The ministry also said WhatsApp \u201ccannot evade accountability and responsibility\u201d when such services are abused by users to spread such misinformation.  \u201cLike the Government of India, we\u2019re horrified by these terrible acts of violence and wanted to respond quickly to the very important issues you have raised,\u201d WhatsApp said in a letter to the ministry dated July 3 and reviewed by Reuters.  \u201cWe believe that false news, misinformation and the spread of hoaxes are issues best tackled collectively: by government, civil society and technology companies working together.\u201d  The messaging service said it is giving users controls and information to help them stay safe, and that it plans to run long-term public safety advertising campaigns.  \u201cAs a starting point, we will soon publish new educational materials around misinformation and conduct our news literacy workshops,\u201d WhatsApp said.  The firm has recently added a feature to its app preventing users from re-adding former members of messaging groups, and has enabled group administrators to decide who can send messages. It is also testing the labelling of forwarded messages.","364":"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India\u2019s top court has asked WhatsApp to respond to a petition that alleges it breaches certain Indian regulations, creating another headache for the Facebook Inc-owned firm already facing pressure in India over fake news.  A man poses with a smartphone in front of displayed Whatsapp logo in this illustration September 14, 2017. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  In an order seen by Reuters on Tuesday, India\u2019s Supreme Court asked the messaging service to respond to the petition, filed by a Delhi-based think-tank called the Centre For Accountability And Systemic Change (CASC), within four weeks.  WhatsApp does not comply with the Information Technology Act, 2000, which mandates \u201cthe appointment of Grievance Officer by all intermediaries.\u201d the CASC says in its petition a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters.  \u201cIt is also required to have a Grievance Officer for users in India. Yet, it is being allowed to continue with its Payments and other services, without any checks,\u201d the petition added.  The Indian IT Act mandates intermediaries or carriers of content like WhatsApp, to appoint a Grievance Officer, to handle any queries, concerns or issues that users of the platform may have that do not come under the purview of other authorities.  WhatsApp declined to make a comment specifically about the litigation or their response to it but a spokesman for the messaging service said it has both an Indian corporate entity and a grievance officer for Indian users.  The grievance officer that the spokesman referred to is based in California, also handling India-related issues.  WhatsApp is working on having a grievance officer based in India following talks with the technology ministry, the spokesman said.  India\u2019s technology, home, law and finance ministries as well as its telecoms regulator are also among the respondents named in the public interest litigation and will have to respond to the court notice in four weeks.  \u201cTo run Payments Service in India, WhatsApp is obligated to have its office and servers in India,\u201d the petition added.  A lack of clarity over the Indian central bank\u2019s directive for storing data of Indian customer locally has delayed the launch of WhatsApp\u2019s inter-bank money transfer service, which is already in testing, a source told Reuters earlier.  Another source said India wanted WhatsApp to have a local head and team that manages local operations before it receives clearance for the formal launch of the payments service.  WhatsApp, which has more than 200 million users in India, has also had to battle the spread of rumors and false messages on its platform that have led to mob killings and sparked calls for action by authorities.  In a meeting with the technology minister this month, WhatsApp pledged to do more to combat the spread of misinformation even though it has said it will not weaken encryption.","365":"FILE PHOTO: Shadow of a 3D-printed Facebook Libra cryptocurrency logo is seen near cryptocurrency representation in this illustration taken, September 13, 2019.

FILE PHOTO: The Facebook logo is displayed on a mobile phone in this picture illustration taken December 2, 2019. REUTERS\/Johanna Geron\/Illustration  Here are some answers to key questions about the case:  WHAT ARE THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST FACEBOOK?  One of the allegations against Facebook is that it strategically seeks to buy potential rivals, often at a big premium, before they have a chance to grow. For example, Facebook bought Instagram in 2012, which at the time had no revenue and a handful of employees but an impressive number of users. It then purchased Onavo in 2013, which protected its users from third-party tracking. It has used Onavo to identify other takeover targets. It bought WhatsApp in 2014.  The FTC also alleged in its complaint that Facebook enticed small, new companies onto the platform in order to make Facebook more attractive to users, but only if they refrained from competing with Facebook itself or with Facebook Messenger.  WHAT REMEDIES DID THE FTC REQUEST THE JUDGE IMPOSE?  The Federal Trade Commission has broad leeway in requesting a remedy, and asked the judge to force Facebook to divest assets, potentially including Instagram and WhatsApp.  It also asked the judge to order Facebook to stop requiring small companies on its platform to not compete with it.  WHAT DOES FACEBOOK SAY ABOUT THESE ALLEGATIONS?  Facebook said it is reviewing the FTC and state antitrust complaints.  The company said the government \u201cnow wants a do-over with no regard for the impact that precedent would have on the broader business community or the people who choose our products every day.\u201d  HOW LONG WOULD A TRIAL AND APPEALS TAKE?  While court hearings to determine if a merger should be stopped can be relatively quick, in this case, the run-up to a trial or trials and the proceedings themselves could last a year or more. A decision could come months after that, antitrust experts said.  ARE THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST FACEBOOK POLITICALLY MOTIVATED?  President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has been angry with several Silicon Valley companies for allegedly silencing conservatives, and many Republican lawmakers have brought up the issue of bias during recent antitrust congressional hearings.  Facebook notably clashed with the administration when it added disclaimers to Trump\u2019s posts, including those that cast doubt on the fairness of the 2020 presidential election.","369":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc and Alphabet\u2019s Google, the two biggest players in online advertising, used a series of deals to consolidate their market power illegally, Texas and nine other states alleged in a lawsuit against Google on Wednesday.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Google and Facebook compete heavily in internet ad sales, together capturing over half of the market globally. The two players agreed in a publicized deal in 2018 to start giving Facebook\u2019s advertiser clients the option to place ads within Google\u2019s network of publishing partners, the complaint alleged. Executives at the highest level of the companies signed off on the deal, according to the complaint.  For example, a sneaker blog that uses software from Google to sell ads could end up generating revenue from a footwear retailer that bought ads on Facebook.  Google reached similar partnerships with other advertising companies as part of an effort to maintain market share that was internally codenamed Project Jedi, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.  But what Google did not announce publicly is that it gave Facebook preferential treatment, the complaint alleged. Facebook agreed to back down from supporting competing software, which publishers had developed to dent Google\u2019s market power, the complaint said.  \u201cFacebook decided to dangle the threat of competition in Google\u2019s face and then cut a deal to manipulate the auction,\u201d it said, citing internal communications.  In exchange, the states said, Facebook received various benefits, including access to Google data and policy exceptions that enabled its clients to unfairly get more ads placed than clients of other Google partners could.  Google spokesman Peter Schottenfels described the states\u2019 accusations about the ongoing partnership as inaccurate and said that Facebook does not receive special data. Facebook did not respond to requests for comment.  The complaint also alleged that Google and Facebook engaged in fixing prices of ads and have continued to cooperate, though the section was heavily redacted and left it unclear just how and when the companies allegedly used their \u201cmarket allocation agreement.\u201d  However, it said that \u201cgiven the scope and extensive nature of cooperation between the two companies, Google and Facebook were highly aware that their agreement could trigger antitrust violations. The two companies discussed, negotiated, and memorialized how they would cooperate with one another.\u201d  The states did not accuse Facebook of wrongdoing in the complaint.  The U.S. Department of Justice also has been investigating the agreement between the companies as part of its antitrust probe into Google, six people familiar with the investigation said. But the Justice Department, which sued Google over separate conduct in October, has yet to bring any allegations related to the 2018 deal.  A Justice Department spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.","370":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc FB.O said on Friday that hackers stole digital login codes allowing them to take over nearly 50 million user accounts in its worst security breach ever given the unprecedented level of potential access, adding to what has been a difficult year for the company's reputation.  Facebook, which has more than 2.2 billion monthly users, said it has yet to determine whether the attacker misused any accounts or stole private information. It also has not identified the attacker\u2019s location or whether specific victims were targeted. Its initial review suggests the attack was broad in nature.  Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg described the incident as \u201creally serious\u201d in a conference call with reporters. His account was affected along with that of Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, a spokeswoman said.  Shares in Facebook fell 2.6 percent on Friday, weighing on major Wall Street stock indexes.  Facebook made headlines earlier this year after profile details from 87 million users was improperly accessed by political data firm Cambridge Analytica. The disclosure has prompted government inquiries into the company\u2019s privacy practices across the world, and fueled a \u201c#deleteFacebook\u201d social movement among consumers.  U.S. lawmakers said on Friday that the hack may boost calls for data privacy legislation.  \u201cThis is another sobering indicator that Congress needs to step up and take action to protect the privacy and security of social media users,\u201d Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Warner said in a statement.  Federal Trade Commission Commissioner Rohit Chopra on Twitter said \u201cI want answers\u201d with a link to a Reuters story on the breach.  \u2018COMPLEX\u2019 FLAW  Facebook\u2019s latest vulnerability had existed since July 2017, but the company first identified it on Tuesday after spotting a \u201cfairly large\u201d increase in use of its \u201cview as\u201d privacy feature on Sept. 16, executives said.  \u201cView as\u201d allows users to verify their privacy settings by seeing what their own profile looks like to someone else. The flaw inadvertently gave the devices of \u201cview as\u201d users the wrong digital code, which, like a browser cookie, keeps users signed in to a service across multiple visits.  That code could allow the person using \u201cview as\u201d to post and browse from someone else\u2019s Facebook account, potentially exposing private messages, photos and posts. The attacker also could have gained full access to victims\u2019 accounts on any third-party app or website where they had logged in with Facebook credentials.  \u201cThe implications of this are huge,\u201d Justin Fier, director of cyber intelligence at security company Darktrace, told Reuters.  FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen in front of displayed binary digits in this illustration taken March 18, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  Guy Rosen, the Facebook vice president overseeing security, said the flaw was \u201ccomplex\u201d in that it resulted from three failings.  A video upload feature should not have displayed on a user\u2019s profile page when accessed through \u201cview as,\u201d Rosen told reporters on a conference call. That alone would not have been problematic except that the video feature wrongly triggered the placement of the powerful login code. And it placed the code not for the \u201cview as\u201d user, but for who they were pretending to be.  Facebook fixed the issue on Thursday. It also notified the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security, Congressional aides and the Data Protection Commission in Ireland, where the company has European headquarters.  The Irish authority expressed concern in a statement that Facebook has been \u201cunable to clarify the nature of the breach and risk to users\u201d and said it was pressing Facebook for answers.  Facebook reset the digital keys of the 50 million affected accounts, and as a precaution temporarily disabled \u201cview as\u201d and reset those keys for another 40 million that have been looked up through \u201cview as\u201d over the last year.  About 90 million people will have to log back into Facebook or any of their apps that use a Facebook login, the company said.  Two Facebook users sued the company over the breach in federal court in California on Friday.  More than 6,000 users complained about the breach on Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook page.  \u201cI\u2019m so scared now. All my activities are on Facebook,\u201d Mohammad ZR Zia, a 25-year-old college student in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, who has been using the social media platform since 2009, told Reuters. His account was logged out earlier on Friday.  The level of concern expressed on Facebook was enough that the company\u2019s automated system temporarily blocked sharing of some articles about the breach.  \u201cOur security systems have detected that a lot of people are posting the same content, which could mean that it\u2019s spam,\u201d a message told users. Facebook later apologized for the misfire.  Facebook has suffered narrower breaches before.  In 2013, Facebook disclosed a software flaw that exposed 6 million users\u2019 phone numbers and email addresses to unauthorized viewers for a year, while a technical glitch in 2008 revealed confidential birth-dates on 80 million Facebook users\u2019 profiles.","371":"(Reuters) - Shares of Acxiom Corp plunged as much as 34 percent on Thursday, after Facebook Inc said it would end its partnerships with several large data brokers who help advertisers target people on the social network.  The stock has now lost nearly half of its market value since Facebook\u2019s comments on Wednesday that added to fears of increased scrutiny around how public data is handled and shared.  Facebook is under pressure to improve how it manages data after disclosing that information on about 50 million Facebook users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.  The social network has for years given advertisers the option of targeting their ads based on data collected by companies such as Acxiom. Facebook\u2019s website lists nine third-party data providers that it has worked with, including Acxiom, Experian PLC, Oracle Data Cloud, TransUnion and WPP PLC.  Arkansas-based Acxiom, which earns over $800 million a year selling consumer profiles to the world\u2019s largest companies, said late on Wednesday it did not expect this change to impact its revenue or earnings for the year ending in March.  However, for fiscal year 2019, Acxiom expects total revenue and profitability to be hurt by as much as $25 million.  \u201cThe immediate impact was small. Now the question is how far does Facebook react to its issues,\u201d First Analysis analyst Larry Berlin said.  \u201cA lot of what (Acxiom) is doing is probably not wrong and probably not at the core of the problem that Facebook has. Targeting consumers using data is sometimes very clean and sometimes it isn\u2019t.\u201d  Even with little raw data, third-party data providers like Acxiom attempt to build detailed pictures of individuals\u2019 finances, relationships, personal interests and purchasing tastes.  These profiles power targeted advertising across the internet, and can also be used to determine what political issues people are interested in and how they might vote.  \u201cI welcome Facebook\u2019s announcement that it will be shutting down its partner category service, using third party data to inform targeted advertising,\u201d said Britain\u2019s Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham in a statement on Thursday.  WPP, Experian, TransUnion and Cisco did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Shares of Acxiom were down 32 percent at $19 by midday. The stock touch its lowest in more than 2 years in early trading.  TransUnion fell nearly 1 percent, while WPP was down marginally.","372":"Feb 3 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Wednesday it fully supported proposed new laws in Australia that would force internet giant Google and social media heavyweight Facebook Inc to pay domestic media outlets for their content.  \u201cWhile Microsoft is not subject to the legislation currently pending, we\u2019d be willing to live by these rules if the government designates us,\u201d the software giant said in a statement.

It has been expanding its team in Europe, including in London.  A well-known European fintech startup, WorldRemit was founded in 2010 by Ismail Ahmed, an entrepreneur from Somaliland, to give consumers an easier and cheaper way to make international money transfers online. The company has 4 million customers and offers services in 150 countries. It has raised $375 million in funding.  Ahmed led the company as CEO until October, when he was replaced by the former chief executive of Paddy Power Betfair Plc, Breon Corcoran.

The FTC is considering making Andrew Smith, a partner at Covington and Burling, LLP, head of its consumer protection bureau. Smith has worked for the Consumer Data Industry Association, whose members include credit reporting companies like Equifax, which is under FTC scrutiny following a massive data breach last year.  Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren, Richard Blumenthal and Brian Schatz said in a letter that Smith\u2019s prior work, and the likelihood that he would be recused from big FTC investigations, meant he was \u201cunfit and unable to function as the FTC\u2019s top consumer advocate.\u201d  \u201cMr. Smith has every right to represent corporations that have harmed consumers, and those companies have every right to be represented by Mr. Smith,\u201d the lawmakers wrote in the letter to FTC Chairman Joseph Simons. \u201cIt is impossible to believe that the best candidate (to head consumer protection) is someone with a long record of representing companies that have been accused of hurting consumers.\u201d  The lawmakers asked the commissioners to delay a vote on Smith while they dug into his past work, and potential conflicts of interest.

U.S. President Donald Trump holds a note with the early results from the 2020 U.S. presidential election in the East Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., November 4, 2020. REUTERS\/Carlos Barria  The posts on Twitter TWTR.N, Facebook FB.O and other sites are imposing a real-time test of Silicon Valley's much-touted rules on handling election misinformation and premature claims of victory.  But it is not clear whether the disclaimers and fact-checks, which often occur well after posts have been shared tens of thousands of times, are curbing the circulation of baseless claims. And in the case of Facebook, staff rewrote some of their rules on the fly.  Critics say that, in environments explicitly built to promote instant sharing and viral posts, bland disclaimers do not cut it.  \u201cWe\u2019re on the brink here,\u201d said Jessica Gonzalez, co-CEO of the advocacy group Free Press. She said Facebook should take down disinformation rather than just flag it.  \u201cWe\u2019re testing our democracy experiment, and Facebook hasn\u2019t gotten it right up to now,\u201d Gonzalez said.  The false and unfounded claims evolved over the course of the day. Initially, Trump said he had won (he hasn\u2019t.) Then he said that unanticipated mail-in votes were appearing out of nowhere (in fact they were long-expected.) Later, Trump\u2019s campaign claimed it had won Pennsylvania (where votes are still being counted.)  Unsubstantiated allegations that ballots for Trump were not counted because voters used Sharpie pens, dubbed \u201cSharpiegate\u201d on social media, were labeled as false on Facebook but shared hundreds of thousands of times.  The rumors prompted more than 100 Trump supporters, urged on by right-wing Twitter figures, to gather in Phoenix on Wednesday and demand to be let into an election building where votes were being counted.  RULES CHANGE  Facebook\u2019s rules evolved too, with eligibility for premature victory labels expanded to non-politicians based on \u201cpotential for virality\u201d and shifting guidance on whether false claims of state victories would get labels.  The claims came as Trump\u2019s lead in battleground states has evaporated as more ballots are counted in Michigan and Wisconsin, a process that has taken longer than usual as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and extraordinarily high turnout. Trump\u2019s Democratic challenger Joe Biden is projected to win Wisconsin and Michigan.  The extended count is no surprise, and neither was the late swing to Biden, which was widely predicted in the run-up to the vote - including by Reuters. That did not stop Trump and his supporters from flooding the internet with unfounded allegations of fraud.  Twitter marked a series of Trump\u2019s tweets, including one making a false claim about \u201csurprise ballot dumps,\u201d as potentially \u201cmisleading about an election\u201d and restricted sharing of the posts.  It also tagged statements by Trump\u2019s son Eric and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany that falsely claimed victory in Pennsylvania.  Facebook put labels underneath several of the president\u2019s false posts to note that \u201cfinal results may be different from the initial vote counts,\u201d but did not restrict interactions with the posts. Each was shared tens of thousands of times.  YouTube, the video service of Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, likewise placed \"results may not be final\" labels below videos containing unsubstantiated claims without identifying the content as false or restricting comments.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  NOT STOPPING THE SPREAD  Even if the disclaimers are curbing the spread of misinformation on their platforms, they have not stopped other media from amplifying Trump\u2019s comments or his claims from hopping from one platform to another.  On Fox News, Trump\u2019s tweets were read out verbatim on Wednesday, sometimes without caveats about their veracity. And on the video-sharing site TikTok, a group called the Republican Hype House shared a video featuring a false claim that Michigan found 138,000 ballots in a lake.  TikTok said the video was later removed for violating its policy against misleading information. Fox did not respond to an email seeking comment.  Alex Stamos, director of the Stanford Internet Observatory, told reporters one critical issue was the tender treatment accorded prominent figures who lie repeatedly on social platforms.  \u201cA lot of it is the elite,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see it over and over again.\u201d  Social media companies have been under scrutiny over how they police rapidly spreading false information and election-related abuses of their platforms. In the weeks before Tuesday\u2019s vote, both vowed action on posts by candidates trying to declare early victory.  The attempts at policing those declarations began early on Wednesday, when Twitter hid a Trump tweet that claimed \u201cwe are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election\u201d behind a label that said it was potentially misleading.  Facebook added a label to the same post, which had about 25,000 shares.  Graphic - Where Biden and Trump stand on the issues: here","376":"SAN FRANCISCO\/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Facebook Inc revealed lofty plans to establish a cryptocurrency called Libra in June, but the project quickly ran into trouble with skeptical regulators around the world.  FILE PHOTO: A small toy figure stands on representations of virtual currency in front of the Libra logo in this illustration picture, June 21, 2019. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  France and Germany pledged to block Libra in Europe and backed development of a public cryptocurrency instead.  Facebook plans for Libra to launch in the first half of 2020 and be run by an association of other corporate investors and non-profit members.  Here are some details:  THE COIN  Libra will be a digital currency backed by a reserve of real-world assets, including bank deposits and short-term government securities, and held by a network of custodians.  The structure is intended to foster trust and stabilize the price.  Although Libra prices may not always align with the underlying assets, holders should have a \u201chigh degree of assurance\u201d that they can convert coins into traditional currency based on an exchange rate, according to the project\u2019s information.  Libra will trade on a network of exchanges, which Facebook did not identify.  TECHNOLOGY  Libra transactions will be powered and recorded by a blockchain, a shared ledger of transactions maintained by a network of computers.  The Libra blockchain will be permissioned, meaning only entities authorized by the governing association will be able to run the computers. Its governance differs from bitcoin, which does not have an entity in charge.  The software will be \u201copen source,\u201d meaning companies outside the association can build applications on top of it.  The association plans to move toward a permissionless blockchain within five years of Libra\u2019s launch.  THE ASSOCIATION  The Libra Association is a 21-member independent non-profit based in Geneva, Switzerland. It will oversee major decisions about the digital coin.  Members include Uber Technologies Inc and Vodafone Group Plc, as well as venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Thrive Capital.  However, the group suffered a serious setback in October, when several high-profile financial companies, including Mastercard, Visa and PayPal abandoned the effort.  There is a minimum $10 million investment to join, except for non-profit members like financial inclusion group Kiva. The association aims to have 100 members by launch.  Each will have one vote on important issues. Facebook will be a member via Calibra, a newly created subsidiary that will offer a digital wallet for Libra.  THE WALLET  Individuals and merchants will be able to use Calibra to store, send and receive Libras.  It will be available as a standalone app on smartphones, as well as a button within Facebook\u2019s Messenger and WhatsApp products.  Facebook eventually wants to make Calibra available for transactions across its family of apps, such as digital checkouts for purchases on Instagram.  The company appears to be betting it can squeeze revenue out of its messaging services through transactions and payments, something that is already happening on Chinese social apps like WeChat.  Executives envision users purchasing Libra through the app either by linking a bank account or, for people without banks, at physical locations like cash transfer businesses and convenience stores.  Calibra engineers are involved in building the blockchain, though Facebook says it intends to keep the currency and the wallet in separate entities.  Calibra has about 100 employees, mostly based at Facebook\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, as well as in Tel Aviv. Calibra executive Kevin Weil told Reuters he did not foresee a dramatic expansion beyond that headcount.  PRIVACY AND SECURITY  Every person who uses Calibra will have to go through a \u201cknow your customer\u201d process, which verifies user identities to prevent financial crimes.  That means anyone who signs up must share a government ID and other personal information.  Calibra will provide support to customers who lose phones or passwords and refund customers whose Libras are stolen by fraudsters, Facebook said.  Calibra will only share user data with parent company Facebook and third parties when it has customer consent, or in other \u201climited cases,\u201d such as when law enforcement requests information, according to a statement.  Facebook pledged not to use Calibra data to improve ad targeting.  Businesses will see the same information about customers who pay with Libra as they do about customers who pay with credit cards, Weil told Reuters.  REGULATION  Regulators have raised eyebrows about the Libra project since its launch, citing concerns about its impact on the financial system, user privacy and its potential for use in money laundering.  The Group of Seven advanced economies warned in July that it would not let Libra proceed until all regulatory concerns had been addressed.  U.S. authorities have also expressed caution. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the project raises \u201cserious concerns\u201d across a range of issues.  French and German finance ministers have said virtual currencies pose risks to consumers, financial stability and even \u201cthe monetary sovereignty\u201d of European states.  Facebook has said it will not seek to establish Libra anywhere in the world until U.S. regulators are satisfied.","377":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a major U.S. business group that represents 14,000 companies including Exxon Mobil Corp, Pfizer Inc and Toyota Motor Corp urged senior U.S. officials to consider removing President Donald Trump from office after supporters of the outgoing president stormed the U.S. Capitol.

Facebook, the world\u2019s biggest social network, will continue to allow campaigns and others to run political ads that are already in the system, and will permit them to change spending amounts and user targeting, but will block adjustments to the ads\u2019 content or design.  The company also said it was creating a label for posts by candidates or campaigns that try to claim victory before the election results are official.  In an interview on CBS News aired on Thursday, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said of the measures: \u201cThis will definitely apply to the president once this policy goes into place, and it will apply to everyone equally.\u201d  President Donald Trump is running for a second term, facing Democratic challenger Joe Biden, and there are also congressional and gubernatorial races.  In a Facebook post announcing the changes, Zuckerberg said he was concerned about the unique challenges voters would face this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has prompted a surge in voting by mail.  \u201cI\u2019m also worried that with our nation so divided and election results potentially taking days or even weeks to be finalized, there could be an increased risk of civil unrest across the country,\u201d he said.  Zuckerberg has previously defended his decision to allow for a freewheeling political conversation on Facebook, including through paid ads, which the company exempts from its fact-checking program with external partners, including Reuters.  A Facebook spokesman told Reuters that political advertisers can resume creating new ads after Election Day.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Twitter Inc TWTR.N last year banned political ads, and Alphabet's GOOGL.O Google limited the ways election advertisers could micro-target voters. [L2N27V0ZD]  Facebook has been battered by criticism, including from its own employees, since allowing several inflammatory posts by Trump to remain untouched earlier this summer, including one that contained misleading claims about mail-in ballots.

But Democratic digital group Acronym said in a statement that Facebook\u2019s move amounted to deciding to \u201ctip the scales of the election to those with the greatest followings on Facebook - and that includes President Trump and the right-wing media that serves him.\u201d  The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Moscow has denied the allegations.  To address those threats, Facebook will label any posts seeking to delegitimize the outcome of the election, he wrote.  The company will also widen the criteria for content to be removed as voter suppression and will remove posts with misinformation about COVID-19 and voting, which Zuckerberg said could be used to scare people away from exercising their right to vote.  Seeking to boost credible information in addition to tamping down misleading posts, Facebook will partner with Reuters to provide news in the social network\u2019s Voting Information Center about official results. It also said it would limit the number of messages that can be forwarded at one time to five.  \u201cI am pleased to see that Facebook is finally beginning to accept some responsibility for how misuse of its platforms threatens our democracy,\u201d Commissioner Ellen Weintraub of the Federal Election Commission said in a statement to Reuters. \u201cBut no one should be under any delusions that this will solve all the problems that Facebook poses to our elections.\u201d","380":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A bomb threat prompted authorities on Tuesday to evacuate a building at the Silicon Valley headquarters of Facebook Inc FB.O, police said, but gave the \"all clear\" after an hours-long search turned up no sign of a device.

The 223 pages of internal communication from 2012 to 2015 between high-level employees, including founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, provide new evidence of previously aired contentions that Facebook has picked favorites and engaged in anti-competitive behavior.  The documents show that Facebook tracked growth of competitors and denied them access to user data available to others.  In 2014, the company identified about 100 apps as being either \u201cMark\u2019s friends\u201d or \u201cSheryl\u2019s friends\u201d and also tracked how many apps were spending money on Facebook ads, according to the documents, referring to Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg.  The insight into the thinking of Facebook executives over that period could invite new regulatory scrutiny into its business practices.  Facebook said it stood by its deliberations and decisions, but noted that it would relax one \u201cout-of-date\u201d policy that restricted competitors\u2019 use of its data.  One document said such competitor apps had previously needed Zuckerberg\u2019s approval before using tools Facebook makes available to app developers.  Zuckerberg wrote in a post on Wednesday that the company could have prevented the Cambridge Analytica data breach scandal had it cracked down on app developers a year earlier in 2014.  Misuse of Facebook user data by Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, along with another data breach this year and revelations about Facebook\u2019s lobbying tactics have heightened government scrutiny globally on the company\u2019s privacy and content moderation practices.

The defunct app developer obtained them as part of its ongoing lawsuit in California state court alleging that Facebook violated promises to app developers when it ended their access to likes, photos and other data of users\u2019 friends in 2015.  Facebook, which has described the Six4Three case as baseless, said the released communications were \u201cselectively leaked\u201d and it defended its practices.  \u2018WHITELISTED\u2019 FOR ACCESS TO FRIENDS DATA  Though filed under seal and redacted in the lawsuit, the internal communications needed to be made public because \u201cthey raise important questions about how Facebook treats users\u2019 data, their policies for working with app developers, and how they exercise their dominant position in the social media market,\u201d Collins said on Twitter.  Dating app Badoo and ride-hailing app Lyft were among other companies 'whitelisted' for access to data about users' friends, the documents here showed.  Lyft wanted to show carpool riders their mutual friends as an \u201cice breaker,\u201d even if those friends were not using Lyft, according to one email. Facebook said in an email that it approved the request because it would add to a feeling of \u201csafety\u201d for riders.  Facebook described such deals as short-term extensions, but it is unclear exactly when the various agreements ended.  Netflix, Airbnb, Lyft and Badoo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The documents show an exchange between Zuckerberg and senior executive Justin Osofsky in 2013, in which they decided to stop giving friends' list access to Vine on the day that social media rival Twitter Inc TWTR.N launched the video-sharing service.  \u201cWe\u2019ve prepared reactive PR,\u201d Osofsky wrote, to which Zuckerberg replied, \u201cYup, go for it.\u201d  Twitter declined to comment.  Friends\u2019 data had stoked the growth of many apps because it enabled people to easily connect with Facebook buddies on a new service.  Facebook weighed charging other apps for access to its developer tools, including the friends lists, if they did not buy a certain amount of advertising from Facebook, according to the emails. In one from 2012, Zuckerberg wrote that he was drawing inspiration for business models from books he had been reading about the banking industry.  Facebook said it ultimately maintained free access to the tools.","383":"March 12 (Reuters) - Gfinity Plc:  * EXCLUSIVE DIGITAL BROADCAST AGREEMENT WITH FACEBOOK, GFINITY ELITE SERIES TO STREAM EXCLUSIVELY ON FACEBOOK UNTIL END OF 2018 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Reuters.Briefs@thomsonreuters.com)","384":"LONDON, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Facebook and other big tech companies should be subject to a compulsory code of ethics to tackle the spread of fake news, the abuse of users\u2019 data and the bullying of smaller firms, British lawmakers said on Monday.  In a damning report that singled out Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg for what it said was a failure of leadership and personal responsibility, the UK parliament\u2019s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee said the companies had proved ineffective in stopping harmful content and disinformation on their platforms.  \u201cThe guiding principle of the \u2018move fast and break things\u2019 culture often seems to be that it is better to apologise than ask permission,\u201d committee chairman Damian Collins said.  \u201cWe need a radical shift in the balance of power between the platforms and the people.\u201d  Collins said the age of inadequate self-regulation must come to an end.  \u201cThe rights of the citizen need to be established in statute, by requiring the tech companies to adhere to a code of conduct written into law by Parliament, and overseen by an independent regulator,\u201d he said.  Facebook became the focus of the committee\u2019s 18-month inquiry after whistleblower Christopher Wylie alleged that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica had obtained the data of millions of users of the social network.  Zuckerberg apologised last year for a \u201cbreach of trust\u201d over the scandal.  But he refused to appear three times before British lawmakers, a stance that showed \u201ccontempt\u201d towards parliament and the members of nine legislatures from around the world, the committee said.  \u201cWe believe that in its evidence to the committee Facebook has often deliberately sought to frustrate our work, by giving incomplete, disingenuous and at times misleading answers to our questions,\u201d Collins said.  \u201cMark Zuckerberg continually fails to show the levels of leadership and personal responsibility that should be expected from someone who sits at the top of one of the world\u2019s biggest companies.\u201d  The lawmaker identified major threats to society from the dominance of tech companies such as Facebook - which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram - Google and Twitter.  Democracy was at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised adverts from unidentifiable sources, they said, and social media platforms were failing to act against harmful content and respect the privacy of users.  Companies like Facebook were also using their size to bully smaller firms that relied on social media platforms to reach customers, it added.

REUTERS\/Charles Platiau\/File Photo  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Facebook Inc on Tuesday launched new advertising options for its premium video content to attract marketers hoping to buy ad spots in a similar manner to traditional television networks.  The social media platform hopes the move will help it make more money from its Facebook Watch feature, which has short-form video content from publishers like the Economist, as well as premium shows starring well-known Hollywood actors like Elizabeth Olsen.  The new program called Facebook Showcase allows advertisers to purchase ad spots in advance at a fixed cost, similar to the way TV networks host an \u201cupfront\u201d featuring new shows and allowing marketers to buy commercials in advance.  That feature, called In-Stream Reserve, will target audiences that are verified by audience measurement company Nielsen, which is also the industry standard for linear TV.  Every video is reviewed by a human before it is eligible to be part of Facebook Showcase, Erik Geisler, Facebook\u2019s head of North America agency sales, said at a press event in New York on Tuesday.  The emphasis on brand safety comes after the social network\u2019s struggles to stop the spread of misinformation on its platform, as well as troubles at video rival YouTube, which lost several advertisers last week after ads displayed next to disturbing content.

The study cited the risks of ex ante regulations where companies are told what to do before any competitive harm or market failure is proven.  \u201cEx ante approaches are poorly fitted for sectors that are rapidly evolving or to regulate low-risk general-purpose technologies,\u201d it said.  ECIPE said the EU legislative framework was not designed for rapid adjustments of rules nor was it clear what market failures the bloc wants to address with new rules or that these could not be resolved once harm is proven.

Facebook confirmed the creation of the new team, describing it as having an \u201cAsia-first\u201d mission and consisting of both product and \u201cbusiness integrity\u201d sub-teams. Its existence has not previously been reported.  A spokeswoman said the team would serve \u201cAsia as well as our global advertisers.\u201d  Facebook sells more than $5 billion a year worth of ad space to Chinese businesses and government agencies looking to promote their messages abroad, analysts estimate. That makes China Facebook\u2019s biggest country for revenue after the United States, which delivered $24.1 billion in advertising sales in 2018.  Zuckerberg once hoped Facebook could find a way to operate its social network in China, making a high-profile visit to the country in 2016 and vowing to learn Mandarin. Product managers went on \u201cknowledge-exchange\u201d trips to China, swapping expertise on app features and advertising tools with counterparts at companies like Tencent and Alibaba, one source said.  The company\u2019s China dreams were ultimately dashed by ever-more-restrictive Chinese government internet policies, compounded by political and business tensions associated with the U.S.-China trade war.  But Facebook remains eager to expand its China ad business, which boasts customers in industries including fashion, social media and gaming. With Beijing aware its businesses must operate beyond the \u201cgreat firewall\u201d to grow, Facebook is positioning itself as the conduit for them to reach global audiences.  \u201cFacebook is committed to becoming the best marketing platform for Chinese companies going abroad,\u201d Facebook wrote in Chinese on local social network WeChat in November.

It cut back drastically in 2019, to nearly nothing, according to previously unreported data from research company Sensor Tower. One source said TikTok calculated it had reached most people likely to use the app, so it shifted to building an ads business to compete against Facebook's. Graphic: Bytedance slows ad blitz on Facebook png, click  A TikTok spokesman confirmed the trend, saying the company \u201csignificantly scaled back spending and refined its ad strategy, resulting in an increased return on investment and stickiness among new users.\u201d  Now looking to smaller Chinese companies to grow sales, Facebook must ease access to its advertising tools and reassure customers worried about the political dynamics.  \u201cSmall advertisers are wary of advertising with Facebook because Facebook is banned in China,\u201d one of the people said, adding that second- and third-tier cities with smaller businesses are key targets for the next phase of growth.  The new Singapore team was seeded in the spring with a handful of senior engineers who moved from Facebook\u2019s Silicon Valley headquarters, according to LinkedIn profiles and the people familiar with the move.  One source described the team as being in the \u201ctens\u201d of people, with Hao Xu, a nearly 9-year veteran of Facebook who previously worked in the Growth unit, managing the effort, according to his LinkedIn profile.  Facebook is betting proximity to regional competitors and sales staff will lead to better ads features, the person said. In addition to China, Facebook does significant business in Asian countries including Vietnam, India and Thailand that have various types of internet restrictions.  The company also wants its engineering outpost to spot emerging trends, having determined the world\u2019s most interesting consumer technologies are being built in Asia, largely in China, one of the people said.  TWO FACES ON CHINA  Even while courting Chinese advertisers, Zuckerberg took an increasingly confrontational approach with Beijing in 2019, coinciding with scrutiny of Chinese apps in Washington and new pressures over U.S. antitrust investigations into Facebook.  In March, he pledged not to build data centers in countries with \u201ca track record of violating human rights like privacy or freedom of expression.\u201d By October, he specifically named China, saying \u201cwe could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there.\u201d  He also drew indignation on Chinese social media after accusing TikTok, which has emerged as a major U.S. rival, of censoring political protest, a charge the startup denies.  But Facebook\u2019s China sales operations have forged ahead.  In the last year Facebook has taken at least a dozen big Chinese clients on trips to India and the Middle East, and showed them data on local consumers to encourage them to market more in those regions rather than just in the United States, one of the people said.  Raggy Lau, who runs Chinese small ad agency STERRY that works with 30 startups, told Reuters he expects to increase spend on Facebook in 2020 as bigger clients vie for its users.  The new engineering team, meanwhile, will aim to ease access for Chinese advertisers and improve fraud detection systems, one of the people said.  Facebook requires people buying ads to have one of its signature social media profiles. Clients in China can access barred overseas sites like Facebook through virtual private networks (VPNs), which allow internet users to change their browsing location to a different country.  But some Chinese businesses are concerned about creating profiles in the face of censorship rules, so building a workaround that could eliminate the need for a VPN has emerged as a key priority.  Greg Paull, principal at advertising consultancy R3, said his Chinese clients use brand spokespeople and online shops differently than Western clients. Facebook could also develop e-commerce tools for Chinese advertisers to organize influencers and set up storefronts, he said.","396":"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., June 10 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc plans to release new versions of its Portal video chatting devices this fall, the company\u2019s vice president of AR\/VR Andrew Bosworth said during an interview at Code Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona.  \u201cWe have a lot more that we\u2019re going to unveil later in this fall, new form factors that we\u2019re going to be shipping,\u201d Bosworth said of the new devices.

The Cambridge Analytica missteps, as well as anger over hate speech and misinformation on its platform, have prompted calls from people ranging from presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren to a Facebook co-founder, Chris Hughes, for the government to force the social media giant to sell Instagram, which it bought in 2012, and WhatsApp, purchased in 2014.

FILE PHOTO: A 3D printed Facebook logo is seen in front of a displayed Russian flag (bottom) in this photo illustration taken on August 3, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  The databases also provided campaigns unprecedented insight into opponents\u2019 online marketing, enabling them to capitalize on weaknesses, political strategists told Reuters.  Facebook Inc and Google, owned by Alphabet Inc, introduced the databases this year to give details on some political ads bought on their services, a response to U.S. prosecutors\u2019 allegations that Russian agents who deceptively interfered in the 2016 election purchased ads from the companies.  Russia denies the charges. American security experts said the Russians changed tactics this year. [nL4N1XH3JT]  Reuters found that 436 ads - 375 on Facebook and 61 on Google - from May through October related to 34 U.S. House of Representatives contests declared competitive last month by RealClearPolitics, which tracks political opinion polls.  Of the 258 removed ads with start and end dates, ads remained on Google an average of eight days and Facebook 15 days, according to data Reuters collected from the databases.  Based on ranges in the databases, the 436 ads were displayed up to 20.5 million times and cost up to $582,000, amounting to a fraction of the millions of dollars spent online in those races.  Asked for comment, Google said it is committed to bringing greater transparency to political ads. Facebook said the database is a way the company is held accountable, \u201ceven if it means our mistakes are on display.\u201d  In some cases, the companies\u2019 automated scans did not identify banned material such as hateful speech or images of poor quality before ads went live.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Ads that are OK when scanned may also become noncompliant if they link to a website that later breaks down.  Google\u2019s database covers $54 million in spending by U.S. campaigns since May and Facebook $354 million, according to their databases.  Facebook\u2019s figure is larger partly because its database includes ads not only from federal races but also for state contests, national issues and get-out-the-vote efforts.  The databases generally do not say why a particular ad was removed, and only Facebook shows copies of yanked ads.  The American Conservative Union political organization, which had 136 ads removed through Sunday on Facebook, said some commercials contained a brief shot of comedian Kathy Griffin holding a decapitated head meant to portray U.S. President Donald Trump.  Removing the bloody image resolved the violation for sensational content, and the organization said it had no qualms about Facebook\u2019s screening.  Some removals were errors. The Environmental Defense Action Fund said Facebook\u2019s automated review wrongly misclassified one of its ads as promoting tobacco.  Ryan Morgan, whose political consulting firm Veracity Media arranged attack ads for a U.S. House race in Iowa, said Google barred those mentioning \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d until his team could explain the ads advocated against the racist belief.  Five campaign strategists told Reuters they adjusted advertising tactics in recent weeks based on what the databases revealed about opponents\u2019 spending on ads and which genders, age groups and states saw the messages.  Ohio digital consultant Kevin Bingle said his team reviewed opponents on Facebook\u2019s database daily to take advantage of gaps in their strategy.  Morgan said his team tripled its online ad budget to $600,000 for a San Francisco affordable housing tax after Facebook\u2019s database showed the other side\u2019s ads were reaching non-Californians.  That political intelligence \u201clet us know that digital was a place we could run up the score,\u201d he said.","399":"LONDON (Reuters) - Facebook Inc FB.O has hired former British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg to lead its global affairs and communications team, as the social network deals with a number of scandals related to privacy, fake news and election meddling.  The appointment makes Clegg, former leader of Britain\u2019s Liberal Democrats and deputy to David Cameron in the 2010-2015 coalition government, the most senior European politician ever in a leadership role in Silicon Valley.  Facebook said Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg were closely involved in the hiring process, and started talking to Clegg over the summer.  \u201cOur company is on a critical journey. The challenges we face are serious and clear and now more than ever we need new perspectives to help us though this time of change,\u201d Sandberg said on a Facebook post congratulating Clegg.  Clegg, 51, succeeds Elliot Schrage and will report to Sandberg beginning on Monday. He will move to California with his family in the new year.  He was ousted as deputy prime minister after the Conservatives won a majority in 2015 in an election that saw his Liberal Democrats suffer a significant loss of support.  Clegg, whose appeal to younger voters was critically damaged when he broke a promise not to raise student tuition fees, lost his own seat in Britain\u2019s parliament in an election last year.  He apologized in 2012 for breaking his promise on student charges, saying \u201cI will never again make a pledge unless as a party we are absolutely clear about how we can keep it\u201d.  Clegg is joining a company that has apologized for its mistakes and has promised to do better on many occasions, for example for breaching its users\u2019 trust.

He will join his Liberal Democrat colleague Richard Allan at the social network.  Allan, a member of parliament between 1997 and 2005 who now sits in the upper house, is Facebook\u2019s vice president of public policy for Europe, Middle East and Africa.  Clegg has discussed online security and privacy, both when in office and more recently in newspaper articles.  \u201cI\u2019m not especially bedazzled by Facebook,\u201d he said in an article in the London Evening Standard in 2016.  \u201cWhile I have good friends who work at the company, I actually find the messianic Californian new-worldy-touchy-feely culture of Facebook a little grating.\u201d  He also said he was not sure that companies such as Facebook really pay all the tax they could, although he added that was as much the fault of governments that still hadn\u2019t got their tax act together.  Schrage, who led the social network\u2019s response to its several scandals, stepped down from the role in June after a decade with the company. Schrage will stay as an adviser, Facebook said.  Facebook has faced a barrage of criticism from users and lawmakers after it said last year that Russian agents used its platform to spread disinformation before and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election, an accusation Moscow denies.  In March, the company faced new scrutiny over how it protects personal information after acknowledging that the data of up to 87 million people ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.","400":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc shares fell 2% on Thursday as Wall Street assessed the wider ramifications of its move to block all news content in Australia.

The board\u2019s 40 members would select cases to review as the world\u2019s largest social media network tries to crack down on harassment, incitement of violence and the spread of false information without infringing freedom of speech.  Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has said that Facebook should not make such decisions, but defer to an independent body of technology and human rights experts free of commercial influences.  Facebook will select inaugural members for three-year terms, but they will independently decide on future membership, Facebook proposed in a draft charter.  Details about the board\u2019s makeup and appeals process will be finalised after a series of workshops over the next six months, wrote Nick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s recently appointed head of global affairs, in a blog post introducing the charter.  At a news conference in Brussels, Clegg also said the company will strengthen rules and safeguards around political advertisements to prevent foreign interference in elections, including those in Europe this year.  Facebook has faced pressure from regulators and the public after last year\u2019s revelation that British consultancy Cambridge Analytical had improperly acquired data on millions of U.S. users to target election advertising.

The new tools are similar to those adopted for the U.S. mid-term elections, Clegg said, with all political ads stored in a publicly searchable library for up to seven years.  This will contain information such as the amount of money spent and the number of impressions displayed, who paid for them and the demographics of those who saw them, including age, gender and location.  The new tools will also cover \u2018issue ads\u2019 which do not explicitly back one candidate or political party but which focus on highly politicized topics like immigration.

The states asked that the Alphabet Inc-owned company, which controls a third of the global online advertising industry, compensate them for damages and sought \u201cstructural relief,\u201d which is usually interpreted as forcing a company to divest some of its assets.  The Texas lawsuit is the second major complaint from regulators against Google and the fourth in a series of federal and state lawsuits aimed at reining in alleged bad behavior by Big Tech platforms that have grown significantly in the past two decades.  Google called the Texas lawsuit \u201cmeritless.\u201d Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Wednesday\u2019s action raises the legal stakes for Google, which is expected to face a third antitrust lawsuit from more than 30 attorneys general on Thursday, according to a source familiar with the matter.  Online publishers including Genius Media Group and news website The Nation alleged on Wednesday in a separate antitrust lawsuit, which seeks class action status, that they lost revenue because of Google\u2019s dominance in online ads. They demand Google divest part of its ads business.  In its lawsuit, Texas asks a judge to find Google guilty of breaking antitrust law and to order the violations to stop. It accuses Google of abusing its monopoly over the digital ads market, allowing its own exchange to win ad auctions even when others bid higher and overcharging publishers for ads.  It also accused Google of working with Facebook. The two companies compete heavily in internet ad sales and together capture over half of the market globally.  \u201cAs internal Google documents reveal, Google sought to kill competition and has done so through an array of exclusionary tactics, including an unlawful agreement with Facebook, its largest potential competitive threat,\u201d the lawsuit said.  The lawsuit, filed in the Eastern District of Texas, also hews closely to concerns publicly raised by Rupert Murdoch-owned News Corp and other media companies to regulators in the United States and Europe over the last two years. It said Google lowered its fees to near zero to gain dominance among publishers, used deceptive tricks to broker transactions between publishers and advertisers, and extracted high fees from both parties for playing referee.

Ad tech fees are falling too. Google\u2019s ad tech fees are lower than the industry average. These are the hallmarks of a highly competitive industry.\u201d  Paxton, along with 10 other state attorneys general, also joined a U.S. Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit against the company in October that accused the $1 trillion California-based company of illegally using its market power to hobble rivals.  The nine states that joined Texas on Wednesday are Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, South Dakota, North Dakota, Utah and Idaho. All have Republican prosecutors.  Google ad sales account for over 80% of Alphabet\u2019s revenue.

Facebook is facing criticism across Washington over Libra, including complaints that it has not sufficiently explained its efforts.  Facebook has reportedly met with other officials at the SEC, as the regulator mulls whether the digital currency should fall under their oversight.  A number of top regulatory officials, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, have expressed concerns about the risks a broadly-adopted digital currency like Libra could pose. David Marcus, Facebook\u2019s lead official on the effort, was grilled by lawmakers Tuesday over data privacy and other security concerns.

The legislation is being closely watched around the world.  With bipartisan support, it could come into law this month despite the misgivings of Google, which says the law will force it to withdraw its search function.  Software giant Microsoft Corp said was confident its search product Bing could fill the gap in Australia if Google withdrew.  Lucinda Longcroft, director of government affairs and public Policy for Google in Australia and New Zealand, said the company had proposed amendments to a Senate enquiry but they were rejected.  Nevertheless, the company still hoped to discuss the law with members of parliament.  \u201cWe look forward to engaging with policymakers through the parliamentary process to address our concerns and achieve a code that works for everyone - publishers, digital platforms, and Australian businesses and users,\u201d Longcroft said in an emailed statement.  Facebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment when contacted by Reuters.  The U.S. search and social media giants have pressed Australia to soften the legislation, with senior executives from both companies holding talks with Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Frydenberg.  Google last week launched a platform in Australia offering news it has paid for, striking its own content deals with publishers in a drive to show the proposed legislation is unnecessary.  Last month, Reuters said it had signed a deal with Google to be the first global news provider to Google News Showcase. Reuters is owned by news and information provider Thomson Reuters Corp.

FILE PHOTO: Facebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks at the Viva Tech start-up and technology summit in Paris, France, May 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Charles Platiau\/File Photo  His comments in a conference call with journalists and in a Facebook post followed a New York Times report on Wednesday that contended that he and other executives tried to deflect criticism internally and in Congress about Russian propaganda spreading through Facebook during the last three years.  Many U.S. lawmakers said after the report that the government must regulate or investigate Facebook, which has become a daily source of information for more than 2 billion people globally.  Zuckerberg said on Thursday that he has acted swiftly to combat the Russian challenge and supports regulation that would encourage companies to reduce the prevalence of \u201charmful content.\u201d  He announced several self-regulatory measures, including rough plans to create an independent body by the end of 2019 to review appeals from users who contend their content was wrongly banned. Users also would get a new choice on whether they want to view \u201cborderline content\u201d in their news feeds, he said.  \u201cI\u2019ve increasingly come to believe that Facebook should not make so many important decisions about free expression and safety on our own,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote.  Facebook shares fell 0.3 percent on Thursday, plus an additional 0.3 percent after hours.  Increased regulation is among the biggest threats to Facebook, along with increasing user unease about the service being a safe and secure place to converse, according to financial analysts.  Company profit margins have narrowed in recent quarters as it executes Zuckerberg\u2019s initial plan to combat misbehavior: spending aggressively on people and technology to bolster monitoring.  NEW PLAN, NEW DATA  Details of the appeals body are evolving, but the goal is to increase accountability of removal decisions and ensure they are not being driven by commercial reasons, Zuckerberg said.  Facebook\u2019s appeals process would expand to enable people who complain about content to seek second opinions if it is not removed initially. In addition, Facebook would become transparent about their rationale as well as policy changes, he said.  His announcement came as part of an update on Facebook\u2019s Transparency Report, which discloses how the company deals with inappropriate content and requests for user data by governments.  For the first time, Facebook on Thursday revealed data on bullying and harassment content, saying it had identified about 2.1 million such posts on its service between April and September, with about 15 percent found proactively before user complaints.  Other notable updates included sharp rises during the first half of this year in censorship demands from Russian and Pakistan authorities and user data requests from Indian authorities, according to Facebook\u2019s statistics.  Facebook has been under for fire for the last two years for its self-admitted sluggishness in developing tools to combat extremist content and propaganda operations.  U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump by undermining Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Russia has denied any meddling in the election.  Western countries issued coordinated denunciations of Russia last month for running what they described as a global hacking campaign, which Russia has also denied.  The New York Times report, which revealed Facebook\u2019s use of a public relations firm to attack critics and rivals, prompted fresh criticism.  U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar said she will ask the Justice Department to look into whether the PR firm engaged in undisclosed political activity as lawmakers weighed new rules on Facebook.  Facebook stopped working with the firm Wednesday, when Zuckerberg said he became aware of it.  Scott Stringer, head of New York City Pension Funds, which holds Facebook shares, renewed a call for an independent board chair to replace Zuckerberg.  Facebook\u2019s board in a statement on Thursday credited Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg for making considerable progress fighting misuse of the social network.","415":"LONDON (Reuters) - Existing securities rules could apply to \u201cstablecoin\u201d digital currency initiatives such as Facebook\u2019s Libra project to help realize its benefits, global securities watchdog IOSCO said on Monday as policymakers examine whether new regulation is needed.  FILE PHOTO: Small toy figures are seen on representations of virtual currency in front of the Libra logo in this illustration picture, June 21, 2019. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo\/File Photo  The watchdog, made up of securities regulators from across the world, including the United States, Europe and Japan, said an assessment of stablecoins found they can potentially offer benefits as well as pose risks.  A stablecoin is a digital currency tied to a \u201cstable\u201d asset or basket of assets that can range from real currencies to commodities. Libra would be pegged to bank deposits and government securities across several currencies such as the dollar and euro.  Nonetheless, Facebook\u2019s plans to launch Libra have raised concerns ranging from consumer protection to money laundering and even the notion that the traditional monetary system could be disrupted.  \u201cOur analysis has shown that so-called \u2018stablecoins\u2019 can include features that are typical of regulated securities,\u201d IOSCO chair Ashley Alder said in a statement.  This means that existing securities rules on disclosures, registration and reporting may apply.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told U.S. lawmakers last month that Libra was a \u201crisky project\u201d, but that it could lower the cost of electronic payments and open up the global financial system to more people.  The tone of IOSCO\u2019s statement is more nuanced than some of the comments from policymakers in European countries like France and Germany, who want Libra blocked. Facebook Libra is due to launch in 2020.  \u201cIt is important that those seeking to launch stablecoins, particularly proposals with potential global scale, engage openly and constructively with all relevant regulatory bodies where they may be seeking to operate,\u201d Alder said.  There is a need for a detailed understanding of the rights and obligations a stablecoin confers on participants and the continuing obligations of the sponsor.  \u201cWe therefore encourage international collaboration, so the risks relating to stablecoins can be identified and mitigated, and the potential benefits realized,\u201d said Alder, who also heads Hong Kong\u2019s securities regulator.  IOSCO said it would help the global Financial Stability Board\u2019s work on stablecoins for the G20 Group of 20 Economies.  The FSB, chaired by Randal Quarles, the Fed\u2019s vice chair for supervision, is looking at whether there are regulatory \u201cgaps\u201d around global stablecoins.","416":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc\u2019s ambitious efforts to establish a global digital currency called Libra suffered severe setbacks on Friday, as major payment companies including Mastercard and Visa Inc quit the group behind the project.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  The two companies announced they would leave the association Friday afternoon, as did EBay Inc, Stripe Inc. and Latin American payments company Mercado Pago. They join PayPal Holdings Inc which exited the group a week ago, as global regulators continue to air concerns about the project.  The latest exodus leaves the Libra Association without any remaining major payments companies as members, meaning it can no longer count on a global player to help consumers turn their currency into Libra and facilitate transactions.  The remaining association members, including Lyft and Vodafone, consist mainly of venture capital, telecommunications, blockchain and technology companies, as well as nonprofit groups.  \u201cVisa has decided not to join the Libra Association at this time,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to evaluate and our ultimate decision will be determined by a number of factors, including the Association\u2019s ability to fully satisfy all requisite regulatory expectations.\u201d  Facebook\u2019s head of the project, former PayPal executive David Marcus, cautioned on Twitter against \u201creading the fate of Libra into this update,\u201d although he acknowledged \u201cit\u2019s not great news in the short term.\u201d  Libra will press ahead with plans to formally charter the association in three days despite the setbacks, Dante Disparte, its head of policy and communication, said in a statement.  \u201cWe are focused on moving forward and continuing to build a strong association of some of the world\u2019s leading enterprises, social impact organizations and other stakeholders,\u201d he said.  \u201cAlthough the makeup of the Association members may grow and change over time, the design principle of Libra\u2019s governance and technology, along with the open nature of this project ensures the Libra payment network will remain resilient.\u201d  Facebook announced plans to launch the digital currency in June 2020 in partnership with other Libra Association members. Almost immediately afterwards, the project faced relentless scrutiny from global regulators, who said it raised a host of serious questions that the group had yet to answer.  France and Germany last month pledged to block Libra from operating in Europe and backed the development of a public cryptocurrency instead. And U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell suggested the project could not advance before addressing serious privacy, money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability concerns that must be addressed.  The rapid succession of exits by major financial companies Friday afternoon suggested that scrutiny was taking its toll.  Three days earlier, a pair of senior Democratic senators wrote to Visa, Mastercard and Stripe, telling them to be wary of \u201ca project that will forseeably fuel the growth in global criminal activity.\u201d  \u201cIf you take this on, you can expect a high level of scrutiny from regulators not only on Libra-related payment activities, but on all activities,\u201d Senator Sherrod Brown and fellow Democratic Senator Brian Schatz wrote in the letters.  Brown said in a statement after the announcements on Friday that the companies had been \u201cwise to avoid legitimizing Facebook\u2019s private, global currency.\u201d  Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to discuss the project when he testifies before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on Oct. 23. U.S. Representative Maxine Waters, who chairs the panel, has repeatedly called on Facebook to shelve the project.","417":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Before Facebook Inc FB.O shut down a rapidly growing \"Stop the Steal\" Facebook Group on Thursday, the forum featured calls for members to ready their weapons should President Donald Trump lose his bid to remain in the White House.  FILE PHOTO: 3D printed ballot boxes are seen in front of a displayed Facebook logo in this illustration taken November 4, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  In disabling the group after coverage by Reuters and other news organizations, Facebook cited the forum\u2019s efforts to delegitimize the election process and \u201cworrying calls for violence from some members.\u201d  Such rhetoric was not uncommon in the run-up to the election in Facebook Groups, a key booster of engagement for the world\u2019s biggest social network, but it did not always get the same treatment.  A survey of U.S.-based Facebook Groups between September and October conducted by digital intelligence firm CounterAction at the request of Reuters found rhetoric with violent overtones in thousands of politically oriented public groups with millions of members.  Variations of twenty phrases that could be associated with calls for violence, such as \u201clock and load\u201d and \u201cwe need a civil war,\u201d appeared along with references to election outcomes in about 41,000 instances in U.S.-based public Facebook Groups over the two month period.  Other phrases, like \u201cshoot them\u201d and \u201ckill them all,\u201d were used within public groups at least 7,345 times and 1,415 times respectively, according to CounterAction. \u201cHang him\u201d appeared 8,132 times. \u201cTime to start shooting, folks,\u201d read one comment.  Facebook said it was reviewing CounterAction\u2019s findings, which Reuters shared with the company, and would take action to enforce policies \u201cthat reduce real-world harm and civil unrest, including in Groups,\u201d according to a statement provided by spokeswoman Dani Lever.  The company declined to say whether examples shared by Reuters violated its rules or say where it draws the line in deciding whether a phrase \u201cincites or facilities serious violence,\u201d which, according to its policies, is grounds for removal.  Prosecutors have linked several disrupted militia plots back to Facebook Groups this year, including a planned attack on Black Lives Matters protesters in Las Vegas and a scheme to kidnap the governor of Michigan.  To address concerns, Facebook announced a flurry of policy changes since the summer aimed at curbing \u201cmilitarized social movements,\u201d including U.S. militias, Boogaloo networks and the QAnon conspiracy movement.  It says it has removed 14,200 groups on the basis of those changes since August.  FACTBOX:  As pressure on the company intensified ahead of the election, Zuckerberg said Facebook would pause recommendations for political groups and new groups, although that measure did not prevent the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d group for swelling to more than 365,000 members in less than 24 hours.  \u2018MEANINGFUL CONNECTIONS\u2019  Facebook has promoted Groups aggressively since Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg made them a strategic priority in 2017, saying they would encourage more \u201cmeaningful connections,\u201d and this year featured the business in a Super Bowl commercial.  It stepped up Groups promotion in news feeds and search engine results last month, even as civil rights organizations warned the product had become a breeding ground for extremism and misinformation.  The public groups can be seen, searched and joined by anyone on Facebook. Groups also offer private options that conceal posts - or the existence of the forum - even when a group has hundreds of thousands of members.  Facebook has said it relies heavily on artificial intelligence to monitor the forums, especially private groups, which yield few user reports of bad behavior as members tend to be like-minded, to flag posts that may incite violent actions to human content reviewers.  While use of violent language does not always equate to an actionable threat, Matthew Hindman, a machine learning and media scholar at George Washington University who reviewed the results, said Facebook\u2019s artificial intelligence should have been able to pick out common terms for review.  \u201cIf you\u2019re still finding thousands of cases of \u2018shoot them\u2019 and \u2018get a rope,\u2019 you\u2019re looking at a systemic problem. There\u2019s no way a modern machine learning system would miss something like that,\u201d he said.

When launched on a wide scale, stablecoins - digital currencies usually backed by traditional money and other assets - could threaten the world\u2019s monetary system and financial stability, a G7 working group said in a report to finance ministers gathered in Washington for the IMF and World Bank fall meetings.  The emerging technology, which like other cryptocurrencies is at present mostly unregulated, could also hinder cross-border efforts to deal with money laundering and terror financing, and throw up problems for cyber security, taxation and privacy, the report said.  \u201cThe G7 believes that no global stablecoin project should begin operation until the legal, regulatory and oversight challenges and risks\u201d are addressed, said the task force, which is chaired by European Central Bank board member Benoit Coeure.  \u201cPrivate sector entities that design stablecoin arrangements are expected to address a wide array of legal, regulatory and oversight challenges and risks,\u201d the report added.  The report underscores concern among global policymakers about stablecoins such as Libra, and presents a further headache for Facebook\u2019s project after a chastening week.  Amid sharp regulatory scrutiny, the 21 firms backing Libra pledged on Monday to forge ahead with the project, shrugging off the defection of a quarter of its original members, including payments giants Visa and Mastercard, this month.  STABLECOINS AND PAYMENTS  In June, Facebook unveiled its Libra coin, a form of stablecoin backed by currencies from the dollar to the euro and government debt, in one of the most high-profile attempts to draw cryptocurrencies into the banking and corporate establishment their creators sought to subvert.  Stablecoins aim to overcome the extreme volatility that plagues cryptocurrencies and renders them impractical for commerce and payments.  Yet Libra drew immediate and sustained criticism. Policymakers voiced concerns about its potential to destabilize the global financial system and erode the power of countries to control monetary policy. Others said it could undermine users\u2019 privacy.  The G7 report said authorities should apply to stablecoins existing rules on payments and anti-money laundering, as well as capital market and banking standards.  It added that new rules may be needed to deal with the emerging technology, with the Financial Stability Board - a body created after the 2008 financial crisis - assessing related regulatory issues before reporting to the Group of 20 wealthy nations in April.  Stablecoins had before Libra attracted virtually no attention from global policymakers, partly because of their relatively tiny size. The biggest, Tether, is only a fraction of the size of bitcoin, the No.1 cryptocurrency.  Facebook says Libra is designed to address inefficiencies in the global payments system, which is beset by high fees, lengthy transfer times and a lack of reliability. That hinders, and in many cases prevents, people from making cross-border payments, especially in developing countries.  The G7 said central banks, finance ministries and other authorities should work to address these weaknesses in payments systems. The public sector, it said, should step up efforts to bring people lacking access to banking services into the financial system.  It added that central banks, by themselves and in cooperation with one another, should look at issuing their own digital currencies.

Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security on top of usernames and passwords by prompting users for information they have access to.  Earlier this month, Facebook introduced this feature for users who managed pages with a large U.S. following, seeking to make it harder to administer a page using a fake or compromised account.

This was apparent as Facebook tried to determine who created pages it said were aimed at sowing dissension among U.S. voters ahead of congressional elections in November. The company said on Tuesday it had removed 32 fake pages and accounts from Facebook and Instagram involved in what it called \u201ccoordinated inauthentic behavior.\u201d  While the United States improves its efforts to monitor and root out such intrusions, the intruders keep getting better at it, said cyber security experts interviewed over the past two days.  Ben Nimmo, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Digital Forensic Research Lab, said he had noticed the latest pages used less original language, rather cribbing from copy already on the internet.  \u201cLinguistic mistakes would give them away before, between 2014 and 2017,\u201d Nimmo told Reuters. \u201cIn some of these newer cases it seems they\u2019ve caught on to that by writing less (original material) when posting things. With their longer posts sometimes it\u2019s just pirated, copy and pasted from some American website. That makes them less suspicious.\u201d  Facebook\u2019s prior announcement on the topic of fake accounts, in April, directly connected a Russian group known as the Internet Research Agency to a myriad of posts, events and propaganda that were placed on Facebook leading up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  This time, Facebook did not identify the source of the misinformation.  \u201cIt\u2019s clear that whoever set up these accounts went to much greater lengths to obscure their true identities than the Russian-based Internet Research Agency (IRA) has in the past,\u201d the company said in a blog post here on Tuesday announcing the removal of the pages. \u201cOur technical forensics are insufficient to provide high confidence attribution at this time.\u201d  Facebook said it had shared evidence connected to the latest flagged posts with several private sector partners, including the Digital Forensic Research Lab, an organization founded by the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank.  FILE PHOTO: People are silhouetted as they pose with mobile devices in front of a screen projected with a Facebook logo, in this picture illustration taken in Zenica, October 29, 2014. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo  Facebook also said the use of virtual private networks, internet phone services, and domestic currency to pay for advertisements helped obfuscate the source of the accounts and pages. The perpetrators also used a third party, which Facebook declined to name, to post content.  Facebook declined to comment further, referring back to its blog post.  U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s top national security aides said on Thursday that Russia is behind \u201cpervasive\u201d attempts to interfere in November\u2019s elections and that they expect attempts by Russia, and others, will continue into the 2020 elections.  They say they are concerned that attempts will be made to foment confusion and anger among various political groups in the United States and cause a distrust of the electoral process.  Two U.S. intelligence officials who requested anonymity told Reuters this week there was insufficient evidence to conclude that Russia was behind the latest Facebook campaign. However, one said \u201cthe similarities, aims and methodology relative to the 2016 Russian campaign are quite striking.\u201d  \u2018PREVIOUS MISTAKES\u2019  Experts who track online disinformation campaigns said the groups who launch such efforts have changed how they post content and create posts.  \u201cThese actors are learning from previous mistakes,\u201d said John Kelly, chief executive of social media intelligence firm Graphika, adding they do not use the same internet addresses or pay in foreign currency.  \u201cAnd as more players in the world learn these dark arts, it\u2019s easier for them to hide among the multiple actors deploying the same playbook,\u201d he said.  Philip Howard, an Oxford University professor of internet studies and director of the Oxford Internet Institute, said that suspicious social media accounts like those taken down this week were once more easily identifiable because they shared the same information from high-profile publications like RT, the Russian English-language news service, or Breitbart News Network.  But now, the content they often share is more diverse and less discernible, coming from lesser known sites, including internet forums that mix political news with other topics, he said.  \u201cThe junk news they\u2019re sharing is using better quality images, for example, more believable domains, less-known websites, smaller blogs,\u201d Howard added.  U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential campaign using tactics including fake Facebook accounts. The Internet Research Agency was one of three Russian companies charged in February by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller with conspiracy to tamper with the 2016 election.

The Court of Justice of the European Union upheld the legality of standard contractual clauses (SCCs) for transferring data following a dispute between Facebook and privacy activist Max Schrems, who has campaigned about the risk of U.S. intelligence agencies accessing Europeans\u2019 data.

Facebook will have to decide how to play the delicate balance of protecting the democratic politicians and activists versus cooperating with the new regime to get services restored--an especially acute example of the political dilemmas the company faces worldwide.  In nearby Vietnam, for example, Facebook recently acquiesced to government demands that it censor more political criticism to avoid a blockade.  The service has mostly avoided shutdowns outside of countries such as China, where it has long been blocked, but currently faces pressure in India, Turkey and elsewhere.  In Myanmar,Facebook in recent years has engaged with civil rights activists and democratic political parties and pushed back against the military after coming under heavy international criticism for failing to contain online hate campaigns.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  In 2018, it banned army chief Min Aung Hlaing - now Myanmar\u2019s military ruler - and 19 other senior officers and organizations, and took down hundreds of pages and accounts run by military members for coordinated inauthentic behavior.  Ahead of the Myanmar\u2019s November election, Facebook announced it had taken down a network of 70 fake accounts and pages operated by members of the military that had posted either positive content about the army or criticism of Suu Kyi and her party.  A Reuters review early this week found dozens of pages and accounts alleging election fraud - the reason given by the army for seizing power. The posts started in October and continued after the election; in the 48 hours before the coup, many of the pages called for military intervention.  After the coup, those pages turned to posts accusing the ousted government of fraud and justifying the takeover, the review showed. Some of the pages published coordinated posts criticizing or threatening politicians like Suu Kyi as well as journalists and activists.  Facebook took down dozens of the accounts on Wednesday, shortly before being shut down. Reuters could not determine their provenance.  And just two days before the coup, the new military-installed information minister, Chit Hlaing, shared a story purporting to be from Radio Free Myanmar, which Facebook banned after it was used in anti-Rohingya disinformation campaigns. The minister was not immediately reachable for comment.  By Wednesday, both his account and the post were taken down.  A spokesman for the military did not respond to multiple calls for comment.  LIKE A \u2018BAN ON THE INTERNET\u2019  Facebook plays an outsized role in Myanmar, where for many residents it is synonymous with the internet. United Nations investigators say that Facebook allowed the platform to be used by radical Buddhist nationalists and members of the military to fan a campaign of violence towards the Muslim Rohingya minority, 700,000 of whom fled an army crackdown in 2017. I  In response, Facebook tried to tamp down hate speech and misinformation and ramped up partnerships with civil society, sometimes in conflict with the military. The company maintained its central role in the life for the country, and Suu Kyi\u2019s government regularly announced major initiatives on its Facebook pages.  \u201cA ban on Facebook is effectively a ban on the internet,\u201d ethnic Kachin human rights advocate Zaw Htun Lat wrote on Twitter on Thursday.  A Facebook spokeswoman referred Reuters to an earlier statement by Southeast Asia policy director Rafael Frankel, which states Facebook is \u201cremoving misinformation that delegitimizes the outcome of November\u2019s election\u201d.  She added that the company is treating Myanmar as an emergency and is using artificial intelligence to restrict content likely to break its rules on hate speech and incitement of violence.  At the same time, the military has used Facebook since the start of the coup. Its \u201cTrue News\u201d information unit had provided daily updates prior to Thursday\u2019s shutdown.  A page for the country\u2019s new military president was created within hours on Monday. Since then, a handful of other official government pages have been taken over by the regime and are publishing official announcements from the ministry of information warning against social media \u201crumors\u201d that could incite riots and instability.

FILE PHOTO: Shadow of a 3D-printed Facebook Libra cryptocurrency logo is seen near cryptocurrency representation in this illustration taken, September 13, 2019. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo\/File Photo  When launched on a wide scale, stablecoins - digital currencies usually backed by traditional money and other assets - could threaten the world\u2019s monetary system and financial stability, a G7 working group said in a report to finance ministers gathered in Washington for the IMF and World Bank fall meetings.  The emerging technology, which is now mostly unregulated, like other cryptocurrencies, could also hinder cross-border efforts to fight money laundering and terror financing, and throw up problems for cyber security, taxation and privacy, the report said.  \u201cThe G7 believes that no global stablecoin project should begin operation until the legal, regulatory and oversight challenges and risks\u201d are addressed, said the task force, chaired by European Central Bank board member Benoit Coeure.  \u201cPrivate sector entities that design stablecoin arrangements are expected to address a wide array of legal, regulatory and oversight challenges and risks,\u201d the report added.  The report underscores concern among global policymakers about stablecoins such as Libra, and presents a further headache for Facebook\u2019s project after a chastening week.  In response, the Libra Association that backs the cryptocurrency effort said it was committed to working with regulators.  Libra was designed to respect national sovereignty over monetary policy, as well as rules against money laundering and other efforts to stop illicit finances, it said in a statement.  \u201cLibra is being designed to work with existing regulatory institutions and apply the protections they provide to the digital world - not disrupt, or undermine, them,\u201d it said.  Amid sharp regulatory scrutiny, the 21 firms backing Libra pledged on Monday to forge ahead with the project, shrugging off the defection of a quarter of its original members, including payments giants Visa and Mastercard, this month.  STABLECOINS AND PAYMENTS  In June, Facebook FB.O unveiled Libra, a form of stablecoin backed by currencies from the dollar to the euro and government debt, in one of the most high-profile attempts to draw cryptocurrencies into the banking and corporate establishment their creators sought to subvert.  Stablecoins aim to overcome the extreme volatility that plagues cryptocurrencies and makes them impractical for commerce and payments.  Yet Libra drew immediate and sustained criticism. Policymakers voiced concern about its potential to destabilize the global financial system and erode nations\u2019 control of monetary policy. Others said it could undermine users\u2019 privacy.  The G7 report said authorities should apply to stablecoins existing rules on payments and anti-money laundering, as well as capital market and banking standards.  It added that new rules may be needed to deal with the emerging technology, with the Financial Stability Board - a body created after the 2008 financial crisis - assessing related regulatory issues before reporting to the Group of 20 wealthy nations in April.  Stablecoins had before Libra attracted virtually no attention from global policymakers, partly because of their tiny size. The biggest, Tether, is only a fraction of the size of bitcoin, the No.1 cryptocurrency.  Facebook says Libra is designed to address inefficiencies in the global payments system, which is beset by high fees, lengthy transfer times and a lack of reliability.  That hinders, and in many cases prevents, people from making cross-border payments, especially in developing countries.  The G7 said central banks, finance ministries and other authorities should work to tackle these weaknesses in payments systems. The public sector, it said, should step up efforts to bring into the financial system people lacking access to banking services.  It added that central banks, by themselves and in cooperation, should look at issuing their own digital currencies.","428":"FILE PHOTO: Facebook logo is seen at a start-up companies gathering at Paris' Station F in Paris, France on January 17, 2017.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday urged Facebook Inc to enact the policy recommendations of the company\u2019s oversight board, empowering the independent group of advisers, which the lawmakers said have limited responsibilities.  Facebook\u2019s oversight board has the authority to overturn decisions by the company and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg on whether individual content should be allowed on Facebook and Instagram. The independent board focuses on a small slice of challenging issues, including hate speech, harassment and people\u2019s safety.  \u201cWe are concerned that Facebook\u2019s Oversight Board \u2014 and its members \u2014 may be ill-equipped and ill-empowered to meaningfully improve the incredibly troubling behavior of the company,\u201d said a letter sent to members of the oversight board from House Energy and Commerce committee Chairman Frank Pallone, Communications and Technology Subcommittee Chairman Mike Doyle and Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee Chair Jan Schakowsky.  \u201c(The board) may simply act as a smokescreen behind which Facebook\u2019s executives will maintain ultimate control over its content moderation decision-making process,\u201d the letter said.  The members said the board\u2019s powers, as defined by its charter, limit it to merely enforcing current content policies the company has adopted.  Facebook declined comment. The oversight board\u2019s spokesman John Taylor said the board is \u201cempowered to make binding and independent decisions\u201d on content issues and is committed to holding Facebook accountable.  Lawmakers, concerned about election interference, have been interrogating social media giants in the run up to the November presidential elections. Zuckerberg was grilled by both Democrats and Republicans about Facebook\u2019s content moderation decisions.  The company unveiled a new policy on Tuesday that would prevent U.S. publishers with political ties from running ads presented as news articles.  In May, the world\u2019s largest online social network, with 2.7 billion monthly active users, named its first set of oversight board members. The company also said the board will grow to about 40 members and pledged to fund it with $130 million for at least six years.","431":"(Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives panel looking into abuses of market power by four big technology companies found they used \u201ckiller acquisitions\u201d to smite rivals, charged exorbitant fees and forced small businesses into \u201coppressive\u201d contracts in the name of profit.  The antitrust subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee recommended that Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Amazon.com AMZN.O and Facebook FB.O - with a combined market value of over $5 trillion - should not both control and compete in related businesses.  The panel\u2019s report broadly recommended structural separations but stopped short of saying a specific company should be broken up.  The scathing 449-page report - the result of the first such congressional review of the tech industry - suggested expansive changes to antitrust law and described dozens of instances where the companies misused their power.  \u201cTo put it simply, companies that once were scrappy, underdog startups that challenged the status quo have become the kinds of monopolies we last saw in the era of oil barons and railroad tycoons,\u201d the report said.  In anticipation of the report, Amazon warned in a blog post Tuesday against \u201cfringe notions of antitrust\u201d and market interventions that \u201cwould kill off independent retailers and punish consumers by forcing small businesses out of popular online stores, raising prices and reducing consumer choice.\u201d  Google said in a statement that it competes \u201cfairly in a fast-moving and highly competitive industry. We disagree with today\u2019s reports, which feature outdated and inaccurate allegations from commercial rivals about Search and other services.\u201d  Facebook said, \u201cWe compete with a wide variety of services with millions, even billions, of people using them. Acquisitions are part of every industry, and just one way we innovate new technologies to deliver more value to people.\u201d  Apple said, \u201cScrutiny is reasonable and appropriate but we vehemently disagree with the conclusions.\u201d The company also defended its commission rates and said it would issue a more extensive response in the coming days.  After more than a year of investigation involving 1.3 million documents and more than 300 interviews, the committee led by Democratic Congressman David Cicilline found companies were running marketplaces where they also competed, enabling \u201cthem to write one set of rules for others, while they play by another.\u201d  Coming just weeks before the Nov. 3 presidential election, the report became an opportunity for Republicans and Democrats to boost their credibility in the fight against market domination by big tech companies.  That said, Congress is unlikely to act on the findings this year. Since the report reflects the views of the Democratic majority in the House, it signals that if Joe Biden wins the White House, the pressure on the companies could well continue.  Also, the report is likely to inform existing antitrust probes against the companies by the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general.  FILE PHOTO: The logos of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google in a combination photo from Reuters files.  Separately, the U.S. Justice Department is investigating large technology companies and is expected to bring a lawsuit against Google soon.  But the report was split along party lines. Republicans on the committee released two short reports, one authored by Representative Ken Buck and supported by three fellow Republicans, which bashed the companies but said that he would not support any call to break them up.  The other was a letter authored by Representative Jim Jordan who criticized Democrats for not probing Big Tech companies for alleged conservative bias and failing to show that existing antitrust law was inadequate.  RECOMMENDATIONS  The panel recommended companies be prohibited from operating in closely aligned businesses. While they did not name any one company, this recommendation would suggest that Google, which runs the auctions for online ad space and participates in those auctions, should potentially be required to separate clearly, or not even operate, the two businesses. For a factbox, click  Facebook\u2019s acquisition of Instagram in 2012 is another example of this. Instagram at the time was small and insignificant, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg saw its potential and noted that it was \u201cbuilding networks that are competitive with our own\u201d and \u201ccould be very disruptive to us,\u201d the report said.  An email received by the committee on Sunday from an unnamed former Instagram employee disputed Facebook\u2019s contention that the two apps could not easily be pulled apart at this stage.  \u201cThey can just roll back the changes they\u2019ve been making over the past year and you\u2019d have two different apps again,\u201d the person wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s turning something on and off.\u201d  As part of the report, the committee staff drew up a menu of potential changes in antitrust law.  The suggestions ranged from the aggressive, such as potentially barring companies like Amazon.com from operating the markets in which they also compete, to the less controversial, like increasing the budgets of the agencies that enforce antitrust law: the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission.  The report also urged Congress to allow antitrust enforcers more leeway in stopping companies from purchasing potential rivals, something that is now difficult.  The antitrust panel will take up the majority report after the October recess for formal adoption and will have a vote on it, the counsels for the committee said.","432":"Then Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe displays a virtual reality headset in San Francisco, June 2015.

The ads linked the drugs, which are known as PrEP and designed to prevent HIV, to severe bone and kidney damage and were placed by personal-injury attorneys.

Here\u2019s a timeline of how the events unfolded in recent years.  July 2017 - Australia\u2019s competition regulator recommended a voluntary code in its Digital Platforms Inquiry to address bargaining power imbalances between major digital platforms - Google and Facebook - and media businesses.  Dec 2017 - The watchdog -- Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) -- said it would investigate whether U.S. online giants Facebook and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google have disrupted the news media market to the detriment of publishers and consumers.  July 2019 - Australia said it would establish the world\u2019s first dedicated office to police Facebook and Google as part of reforms designed to rein in the U.S. technology giants.  Dec 2019 - The Government directed the ACCC to work with both the news and digital platform businesses to develop a voluntary code.  April 2020 - the government directed the ACCC to draft a mandatory code after the regulator advised that the businesses were \u201cunlikely to reach voluntary agreement\u201d and COVID-19 exacerbated the pressures faced by Australian media sector  July 2020 - The ACCC released draft legislation for the media bargaining code.  July 2020 - Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg says the country would force Facebook and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google to pay Australian media outlets for news content.

On Aug. 10, he gave Facebook 15 days to comply with court takedown orders or face charges under the local Computer Crime Act, which carries a fine of up to 200,000 baht ($6,367.40) and an additional 5,000 baht ($159.18) per day until each order is observed.

The reasoning was that the young chairman and chief executive needed \u201crunway\u201d to build Facebook, without the pesky distractions most public companies face from unwashed shareholder hordes.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg responds to a question during a news conference at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California May 26, 2010. REUTERS\/Robert Galbraith  Facebook\u2019s board liked the idea so much that, a few years later, it proposed creating a new class of shares which would have conferred no say at all on their owners, further entrenching Zuckerberg. That plan was dropped last fall \u2013 a nod to shareholder opposition \u2013 but the founder still has outright voting control. Now that he is in over his head amidst a maelstrom of data-mishandling allegations, Facebook\u2019s regular shareholders should be feeling buyers\u2019 remorse.  Investors have wiped some $60 billion off the value of the company in two days. Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg appear to have hunkered down, either unwilling or unable to offer an effective public response to allegations that personal customer data was swiped and used for political purposes. Along with previous charges that Facebook\u2019s platform was manipulated by shady actors linked to Russia in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, that suggests regulatory responses \u2013 and perhaps accelerated customer flight \u2013 are now inevitable.  It\u2019s far from the first time an American corporation has been buffeted by personal data-related trouble, whether stemming from a hack or the inappropriate use of confidential information. Equifax, for example, last year revealed a shocking data breach, including the exposure of Social Security numbers, affecting more than 140 million U.S. consumers. Chairman and CEO Richard Smith resigned. He was also hauled in front of Congress to answer for what happened.  That company\u2019s role in collecting sensitive financial data and scoring U.S. consumers\u2019 creditworthiness made the implications of the misuse of data starkly obvious. Facebook\u2019s actual and perceived errors \u2013 or perhaps omissions \u2013 have less easily defined consequences. These may, however, range from giving third parties access to more personal user data than they should have to nudging the outcome of elections in several countries. And they potentially affect billions rather than millions of people around the world.  Yet Zuckerberg and Sandberg haven\u2019t yet had anything to say about the latest expos\u00e9, which involves Facebook data on 50 million Americans that may have been misused by political consultants at UK data-mining company Cambridge Analytica, according to reports in the New York Times and the Observer. Users and investors alike deserve greater transparency. It may be premature for owners to call for Zuckerberg, or Sandberg, to go. But that threat is one of the disciplining forces at nearly all public companies. At Facebook, though, shareholders have no ability to force action.  Zuckerberg controls Facebook through direct ownership of or voting rights over some 86 percent of the company\u2019s 534 million shares of Class B stock, which have 10 votes per share, according to the company\u2019s 2017 proxy statement. He also owns about 0.1 percent of the 2.4 billion one-share, one-vote Class A securities outstanding. The combination gives him a 59.7 percent say, despite a claim of only around 16 percent on the company\u2019s economics.  Facebook\u2019s board has a role to play, of course. But with so many insiders and Zuckerberg cronies as directors, that puts the onus on Sue Desmond-Hellman, the lead independent director. Alongside her board colleague Erskine Bowles, she rubber-stamped Zuckerberg\u2019s desire two years ago to introduce Class C no-vote shares, a move that sparked proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services to recommend shareholders vote against their nominations.  The powerlessness of outside investors was made clear right from the start. In the letter Zuckerberg wrote for prospective shareholders in 2012, he said Facebook was \u201cnot originally created to be a company.\u201d It was built, he wrote, \u201cto accomplish a social mission \u2013 to make the world more open and connected.\u201d That mission may have been achieved beyond the wildest expectations of Zuckerberg and, especially, Facebook\u2019s users \u2013 and in ways that arguably have gotten out of control.  What may be the beginning of a crisis for the company has also come around far sooner than Zuckerberg\u2019s supine shareholders could have anticipated. Whether it turns out he can handle it or not, they are stuck with him.","446":"March 6 (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd on Tuesday filed a patent infringement lawsuit against social media platforms Facebook Inc and its units WhatsApp and Instagram.

The move to build up e-commerce offerings follows Facebook\u2019s launch last year of limited shopping options on photo-sharing app Instagram and messaging app WhatsApp. Company leaders wager making the platforms more business-friendly will generate fresh ad revenue, even as user growth slows.  Facebook Shops will tie at least some of those efforts together, enabling businesses to set up a single online store accessible via both Facebook and Instagram. A checkout feature will enable in-app purchases, while a more deeply integrated messaging feature will allow customers to chat with businesses through WhatsApp, Messenger or Instagram Direct.  Zuckerberg also said the world's largest social network would be working more closely on product integrations with Shopify SHOP.NSHOP.TO and seven other online commerce platforms going forward.

Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School, tweeted on Wednesday that the relationship was not as voluntary as it seems, and most publishers feel obligated to be on Facebook due to its dominance.

Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond stands outside 11 Downing Street before he delivers his budget statement in the House of Commons in London, Britain, October 29, 2018. REUTERS\/Henry Nicholls  \u201cIt\u2019s clearly not sustainable, or fair, that digital platform businesses can generate substantial value in the UK without paying tax here in respect of that business,\u201d finance minister Philip Hammond said in his annual budget speech on Monday.  The tax will be designed to ensure established tech giants, rather than start-ups, shoulder the burden, Hammond told parliament.  The Treasury said profitable companies would be taxed at 2 percent on the money they make from UK users from April 2020, and the measure was expected to raise more than 400 million pounds ($512 million) a year. The tax will be based on self-assessment by the companies.  Big internet companies, which say they follow tax rules, had previously paid little tax in Europe, typically by channeling sales via countries such as Ireland and Luxembourg which have light-touch tax regimes.  Google, Facebook and Amazon have changed the way they account for their activity in Britain in recent years.  In 2016, Facebook for example starting recording revenue from its UK customers supported by local sales teams, and subjecting any taxable profit on the income to UK corporation tax.  However, a number of offsets meant Facebook had a tax charge for 2016 in Britain of 5.1 million pounds compared with 4.2 million pounds for 2015.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  SLOW INTERNATIONAL PUSH  The tax will target platforms such as search engines, social media and online marketplaces, Hammond said, and it will be paid by companies that generate at least 500 million pounds a year in global revenue.  Britain had been leading attempts to reform international corporate tax systems, Hammond said, but progress had been painfully slow and governments could not simply talk forever.  Clifford Chance tax partner Dan Neidle said the radical nature of the proposal clearly showed that Britain was becoming frustrated with the slow pace of change in global tax laws.  \u201cThe UK is running ahead of every other country except Spain,\u201d he said.  But given the dominance of U.S. tech giants, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration may not appreciate the proposal at a time when Britain is trying to agree new trade deals.  The European Commission proposed in March that EU states would charge a 3 percent levy on digital revenues of large firms like Google and Facebook.  But the plan is opposed by smaller states like Ireland, which fears losing revenues, and by Nordic governments which think the tax could stifle innovation and trigger retaliation from the United States - the home to most of the firms which could be hit by the proposed tax.  France, which supports a new levy, put forward last month the idea that such a tax would have a \u201csunset clause\u201d, meaning the tax would end when a global solution is found.  Hammond said on Monday that if a global solution emerges, Britain would consider adopting this instead of its levy.  But in the meantime, the government would consult on the detail to make sure it got its plan right, and then ensure Britain remained one of the best places to start and scale up a tech business.

The workers categorize items according to five \u201cdimensions,\u201d as Facebook calls them.  These include the subject of the post - is it food, for example, or a selfie or an animal? What is the occasion - an everyday activity or major life event? And what is the author\u2019s intention - to plan an event, to inspire, to make a joke?  The work is aimed at understanding how the types of things users post on its services are changing, Facebook said. That can help the company develop new features, potentially increasing usage and ad revenue.  Details of the effort were provided by multiple employees at outsourcing firm Wipro Ltd over several months. The workers spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation by the Indian firm. Facebook later confirmed many details of the project. Wipro declined to comment and referred all questions to Facebook.  The Wipro work is among about 200 content labeling projects that Facebook has at any time, employing thousands of people globally, company officials told Reuters. Many projects are aimed at \u201ctraining\u201d the software that determines what appears in users\u2019 news feeds and powers the artificial intelligence underlying many other features.  The labeling efforts have not previously been reported.  \u201cIt\u2019s a core part of what you need,\u201d said Nipun Mathur, the director of product management for AI at Facebook. \u201cI don\u2019t see the need going away.\u201d  The content labeling program could raise new privacy issues for Facebook, according to legal experts consulted by Reuters. The company is facing regulatory investigations worldwide over an unrelated set of alleged privacy abuses involving the sharing of user data with business partners.  The Wipro workers said they gain a window into lives as they view a vacation photo or a post memorializing a deceased family member. Facebook acknowledged that some posts, including screenshots and those with comments, may include user names.  The company said its legal and privacy teams must sign off on all labeling efforts, adding that it recently introduced an auditing system \u201cto ensure that privacy expectations are being followed and parameters in place are working as expected.\u201d  But one former Facebook privacy manager, speaking on condition of anonymity, expressed unease about users\u2019 posts being scrutinized without their explicit permission. The European Union\u2019s year-old General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has strict rules about how companies gather and use personal data and in many cases requires specific consent.  \u201cOne of the key pieces of GDPR is purpose limitation,\u201d said John Kennedy, a partner at law firm Wiggin and Dana who has worked on outsourcing, privacy and AI.  If the purpose is looking at posts to improve the precision of services, that should be stated explicitly, Kennedy said. Using an outside vendor for the work could also require consent, he said.  It remains unclear exactly how GDPR will be interpreted and whether regulators and consumers would see Facebook\u2019s internal labeling practices as problematic. Europe\u2019s top data privacy official declined to comment on possible concerns.  A Facebook spokeswoman said: \u201cWe make it clear in our data policy that we use the information people provide to Facebook to improve their experience and that we might work with service providers to help in this process.\u201d  U.S. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat and leading critic of social media, told Reuters in a statement that large platforms increasingly are \u201ctaking more and more data from users, for wider and more far-reaching uses, without any corresponding compensation to the user.\u201d  Warner said he is drafting legislation that would require Facebook to \u201cdisclose the value of users\u2019 data, and tell users exactly how their data is being monetized.\u201d  THE PROJECT  Human-powered content labeling, also referred to as \u201cdata annotation,\u201d is a growth industry as companies seek to harness data for AI training and other purposes.  Self-driving car companies such as Alphabet Inc\u2019s Waymo have labelers identify traffic lights and pedestrians in videos to fortify their AI. Voice assistant developers including Amazon.com Inc have people annotate customer audio to improve AI\u2019s ability to decipher speech.  Facebook launched the Wipro project in April last year. The Indian firm received a $4 million contract and formed a team of about 260 labelers, according to the workers. Last year, the work consisted of analyzing posts from the prior five years.  After completing that, the team in December was cut to about 30 and shifted to labeling each month posts from the prior month. Work is expected to last through at least the end of 2019, they said.  Facebook confirmed the staffing changes but declined to comment on financial details.  The company said its analysis is ongoing so it could not provide any findings from the labeling or resulting product decisions. It has not told labelers the purpose or results of the project, and the workers said all they have inferred from their limited view is that selfies are increasingly popular.  The Wipro labelers and Facebook said the posts are a random sampling of text-based status updates, shared links, event posts, Stories feature uploads, videos and photos, including user-posted screenshots of chats on Facebook\u2019s various messaging apps. The posts come from Facebook and Instagram users globally, in languages including English, Hindi and Arabic.  Each item goes to two labelers to check accuracy, and a third if they disagree, Facebook said. Workers said they see on average 700 items per day. Facebook said the target average is lower.  Facebook confirmed labelers in Timisoara, Romania and Manila, the Philippines are involved in the same project.  Among Facebook\u2019s other labeling projects, one worker in Hyderabad for outsourcing vendor Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp said he and at least 500 colleagues look for sensitive topics or profane language in Facebook videos.  The aim is to train an automated Facebook tool that enables advertisers to avoid sponsoring videos that are, for example, adult or political, Facebook said. Cognizant did not respond to a request for comment.  Another application of labeling involved the social network\u2019s Marketplace shopping feature, where it automated category recommendations for new listings by first having labelers and product experts categorize some existing listings, Facebook\u2019s Mathur said.  PRIVATE POSTS  Facebook users are not offered the chance to opt out of their data being labeled.  At Wipro, the posts being examined include not only public posts but also those that are shared privately to a limited set of a user\u2019s friends. That ensures the sample reflects the range of activity on Facebook and Instagram, said Karen Courington, director of product support operations at Facebook.  Facebook\u2019s data policy does not explicitly mention manual analysis.  \u201cWe provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys,\u201d the policy states.  Europe\u2019s GDPR also requires companies delete user data upon request. Facebook said it has technology to routinely sync labeled posts with both deletion requests and changes to content privacy settings.  Facebook and other companies are testing techniques to curtail the need for outsourced labeling, in part to analyze more data faster and cheaper. For instance, AI training data for news feed rankings and photo descriptions for the blind came from hashtags on Instagram posts, Facebook\u2019s Mathur said.  \u201cWe try to minimize the amount of things we send out,\u201d he said.","460":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Facebook FB.O has removed \"treason\" as a keyword to identify its users' interests for advertisers, it said on Wednesday, after Danish state broadcaster DR revealed its existence.

They oversee money including pension funds and joined activist and original filer Trillium Asset Management.  A similar shareholder proposal seeking an independent chair was defeated in 2017 at Facebook, where Zuckerberg\u2019s majority control makes outsider resolutions effectively symbolic.  Rhode Island State Treasurer Seth Magaziner said that the latest proposal was still worth filing as a way of drawing attention to Facebook\u2019s problems and how to solve them.  \u201cThis will allow us to force a conversation at the annual meeting, and from now until then in the court of public opinion,\u201d Magaziner said in a telephone interview.  A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment.  At least three of the four public funds supported the 2017 resolution as well. The current proposal, meant for Facebook\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in May 2019, asks the board to create an independent board chair to improve oversight, a common practice at other companies.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  It cites controversies that have hurt the reputation of the world\u2019s largest social media network, including the unauthorized sharing of user information, the proliferation of fake news, and foreign meddling in U.S. elections.

Shares of Facebook have had a rocky year, under pressure from revelations about the privacy and operational issues as well as concerns over slowing revenue growth. They closed Wednesday at $159.42, 10 percent lower than at the start of the year and well off a closing high of $217.50 reached on July 25.  The 2017 resolution received the support of a slim majority of outside investors, according to the public fund leaders\u2019 calculations. Magaziner and Frerichs said they planned to talk with larger Facebook investors in coming months to seek their support.

His apologies precede two days of congressional hearings this week, where Zuckerberg will be asked how 87 million Facebook users\u2019 data was improperly shared with a political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica.  He will also likely face questions about ads and posts placed by Russian operatives, in what U.S. authorities believe was an attempt to influence the U.S. 2016 election.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake,\u201d he said in written remarks released by the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee on Monday. \u201cIt was my mistake, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d  If Zuckerberg does not provide satisfactory answers this week, Congress is more likely to push new laws to strictly regulate Facebook. Anticipating such a move, the company has already said it favors new legislation that would make social networks disclose who is behind political ads, much as TV and radio stations must already do.  Tighter regulation of how Facebook uses its members\u2019 data could affect its ability to attract advertising revenue, its lifeblood. Facebook shares closed up 0.5 percent on Monday. They are still down almost 17 percent from highs hit in January, amid a broader tech selloff, partly because of investor concerns about regulation.  PRIVACY ISSUES  Zuckerberg traversed Capitol Hill on Monday surrounded by police and trailed by packs of reporters ahead of his scheduled appearance before three congressional committees on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Zuckerberg held meetings with the top Republican and Democratic senators on the Commerce and Judiciary committees that will question him on Tuesday in a joint meeting. He faces further grilling from the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  On Monday, he was pictured in one photo showing his mobile device to Senator Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee. He did not respond to questions from reporters as he entered and left the building.

He also met Chuck Grassley, the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s Republican chairman, and the leading Democrat on that committee, Dianne Feinstein.  Top of the agenda in this week\u2019s hearings will be Facebook\u2019s dealings with Cambridge Analytica, a London-based company that counts U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign among its past clients, or go-betweens. Cambridge Analytica has disputed Facebook\u2019s estimate of the number of affected users.  Lawmakers are also expected to press Zuckerberg closely on the 2016 election, which he anticipated in his written testimony.  \u201cIt\u2019s clear now that we didn\u2019t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm...\u201d he said. \u201cThat goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy.\u201d  Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony said the company was \u201ctoo slow to spot and respond to Russian interference, and we\u2019re working hard to get better.\u201d He vowed to make improvements, adding it would take time, but he was \u201ccommitted to getting it right.\u201d  (Read the full testimony tmsnrt.rs\/2IDTHwF)  Slideshow ( 6 images )  Facebook disclosed in September that Russians under fake names had used the social network to try to influence U.S. voters in the months before and after the 2016 election, writing about inflammatory subjects, setting up events and buying ads.

That and the fact they are sort of sit in a place where they\u2019ve had some pretty strong relative success versus the broader market.\u201d  ROBERT PHIPPS, DIRECTOR, PER STIRLING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, AUSTIN, TEXAS  \u201cMost of the weakness is centered around tech. Tech has outperformed so dramatically this year. It hasn\u2019t backed off when other sectors have. So it needed some catalyst to adjust down some. Apple announced that it is building out vertical capacity. It\u2019s building screens for its phones. That affects the companies that supply those tech components overseas...Then there\u2019s the news related to Facebook and the data mining during the Trump campaign.\u201d  \u201cI also think there\u2019s some nervousness about how close the Russia investigation is getting to the White House. The market hates uncertainty more than anything else, and there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty emanating out of the White House. Some of that is turnover, and some of it is Trump\u2019s tweets. He was tweeting like crazy over the weekend.\u201d  TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, INVERNESS COUNSEL, NEW YORK  \u201cIt\u2019s really traceable to the Facebook news. Maybe there\u2019s a little concern about Apple, iPhone demand. The European Union\u2019s proposed tax on digital revenue is certainly contributing to concerns about the tech sector today as well. It\u2019s a \u2018pile on technology\u2019 day. The Facebook issue has high visibility because of the connection to the election and the concern about Russian meddling. This could drag out for a while...But I don\u2019t think regulation of the internet is likely. It would be tough to enforce.\u201d  SHAWN CRUZ, SENIOR TRADING SPECIALIST, TD AMERITRADE, CHICAGO  \u201cThere are three things that are playing out now and will play out this week. We get Jerome Powell\u2019s first meeting as the head of the Fed and I think a lot of market watchers are expecting his rhetoric a little more hawkish in terms of outlook for monetary policy. People want to see how those forecasts change.\u201d  \u201cSecond, we start the G20, I\u2019d expect there are quite a few headlines related trade and tariffs and what the potential response is going to be and if you get major headlines out of that, that could really the industrial and material stocks to move around.  \u201cFacebook is drawing scrutiny for improper use of data and that\u2019s dragging a lot of those FAANG stocks down because at the end of the day, really what a lot of those companies did is they were taking a lot of those data and used algorithms to dial in their products. They are going to get a lot more scrutiny over what data they are collecting and how they are using it and I think there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty as to how that\u2019s going to play out.  JAKE DOLLARHIDE, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, LONGBOW ASSET MANAGEMENT IN TULSA, OKLAHOMA  \u201cThere\u2019s the thought that the government might try to regulate tech. You open a slippery slope. If you regulate Facebook what\u2019s to say that wouldn\u2019t have a domino effect. Google, maybe Uber?\u201d  \u201cWhat\u2019s to stop the government for getting its fingers in all these areas. People have thought right now the tech growth rate has no boundaries, no ceiling. Today people are beginning to question that. If it\u2019s the case now, will it still be the case in the future.\u201d  MARK LUSCHINI, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT, PHILADELPHIA  \u201cObviously this week we\u2019re going to have the (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting, and its (Fed Chairman) Jerome Powell\u2019s first time presiding over it, and there\u2019s some belief that they may come out with a reconfiguration of the dot plot that could indicate a more hawkish stance. The market\u2019s perhaps trying to square to that a little bit.  \u201cThe other thing too here is obviously much has been made of the rally in tech stocks, and the fact that they\u2019ve been driving the market as they represent 25 percent of the S&P 500 and obviously led the Nasdaq to all-time highs and a full recovery from the correction which no other index has done. If they start to decay, then it may leave investors wondering what\u2019s left to become the new leader to resume the bulls\u2019 advance.\u201d  MARKET REACTION:  STOCKS: The S&P 500 was down 1.84 percent, the tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 2.46 percent and the Dow was down 1.72 percent.

We promptly issued a fix to the latest version of WhatsApp to resolve this issue,\u201d WhatsApp said in an email statement to Reuters.  A WhatsApp employee familiar with dealing of the issue said there was no evidence that hackers actually exploited the bug to launch attacks.  A Google spokesman also said the company was not aware of the bug ever being used in an attack before getting patched.  But Travis Ormandy, a researcher at Google Project Zero which discovered the bug, called it a \u201cbig deal.\u201d  \u201cJust ++answering a call from an attacker could completely compromise WhatsApp,\u201d he said on Twitter.

The top Republican and Democrat on the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee said Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg should have disclosed those data-sharing partnerships when he testified before Congress in April.  \u201cClearly, the company\u2019s partnerships with Chinese technology companies and others should have been disclosed before Congress and the American people,\u201d the panel\u2019s Republican chairman Greg Walden and ranking Democrat Frank Pallone said in a statement.  \u201cWe strongly encourage full transparency from Facebook and the entire tech community,\u201d they wrote.  On Tuesday, Facebook said Huawei Technologies Co Ltd , computer maker Lenovo Group, and smartphone makers OPPO and TCL Corp were among about 60 companies worldwide that received access to some user data after they signed contracts to re-create Facebook-like experiences for their users.  Huawei, the world\u2019s third largest smartphone maker, has come under scrutiny from U.S. intelligence agencies who argue that Chinese telecommunications companies provide an opportunity for foreign espionage and threaten critical U.S. infrastructure, something the Chinese have consistently denied.  Facebook on Tuesday said it would end the Huawei pact this week and was ending the other three Chinese partnerships as well, adding that more than half of the partnerships had already wound down.  A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman had no comment on the companies\u2019 agreements.  Members of Congress have expressed concern after The New York Times reported that the data of users\u2019 friends could have been accessed without their explicit consent. Facebook denied that and said the data access was to allow its users to access account features on mobile devices.  In a separate letter on Tuesday, the Senate Commerce Committee also pressed Facebook for more information, while the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s top Democrat urged Facebook to release further details.  Facebook said it would address the Commerce Committee\u2019s questions.  Congressional staff have said the company still has not answered hundreds of questions from lawmakers after Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony before two committees in April.  Other companies that have used Facebook data sharing include Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, HTC Corp, Microsoft Corp and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , Facebook has said.

Facebook dipped 0.6 percent, while Twitter dropped 2.4 percent as their top executives appeared in front of the Congress over what lawmakers see as a failure to combat continuing foreign efforts to influence U.S. politics.  Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey started their testimony from 9:30 a.m. ET (1330 GMT) onwards. Snapchat-parent Snap Inc was down 2.5 percent.  \u201cWe are definitely going to see a negative tilt today with the big social media leaders appearing in front of Congress,\u201d said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.  U.S. trade deficit rose to a five-month high in July due to weak exports of soybeans and civilian aircraft, Commerce Department data showed, suggesting the Trump administration\u2019s protectionist policy was so far not having an impact.  The data comes as consultations on a U.S. proposal to impose tariffs on $200 billion more in Chinese imports ends on Sept. 6, with Trump ready to impose these tariffs after that, according to Bloomberg.  Caterpillar and Boeing were down 0.4 percent each.  The United States and Canada will also resume talks to settle differences on revamping the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), despite Trump\u2019s threats to continue trade deals with just Mexico in a bilateral agreement.  \u201cThere\u2019s still a cloud hanging over the market about whether we are actually going to see these (Chinese) tariffs take effect by the end of this week and continued concerns about the NAFTA deal,\u201d said Brown.  Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, led by a 0.92 percent drop in energy stocks.  Oil fell below $78 a barrel as a U.S. Gulf tropical storm weakened and moved away from oil-producing areas and concern about weakening global demand added downward pressure.  At 9:56 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.81 points, or 0.02 percent, at 25,957.29, the S&P 500 was down 4.82 points, or 0.17 percent, at 2,891.90 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 34.28 points, or 0.42 percent, at 8,056.97.  Halliburton dropped 5.6 percent, the most on the S&P, after the oilfield services provider said it expects moderating oil and gas activity in North America and a slower-than-expected ramp up of new contracts in the Middle East to hurt third-quarter results.  Shares of rival Schlumberger fell 1.6 percent on the news.  General Electric, whose oilfield services arm is Baker Hughes, was down 2.4 percent. Brokerage UBS cut its price target on GE\u2019s stock on concerns over the company\u2019s power business.

He rejected Facebook\u2019s arguments that users suffered no \u201ctangible\u201d harm and had no legitimate privacy interest in information they shared with friends on social media.  \u201cFacebook\u2019s motion to dismiss is littered with assumptions about the degree to which social media users can reasonably expect their personal information and communications to remain private,\u201d Chhabria wrote. \u201cFacebook\u2019s view is so wrong.\u201d  Neither Facebook nor its lawyers immediately responded to requests for comment.

These included the 2015 breach that allowed Cambridge Analytics, a British political consulting firm, to access data for an estimated 87 million Facebook users.

In their 414-page complaint, users said Facebook misled them into thinking they could keep control over personal data, when in fact it let thousands of \u201cpreferred\u201d outsiders such as Airbnb, Lyft and Netflix gain access.  Chhabria faulted Facebook for treating privacy as an \u201call-or-nothing\u201d proposition, where users would forfeit their privacy by sharing data even in a \u201climited\u201d fashion.  He said Facebook had taken different positions elsewhere, including in a California case where it likened information kept on social media accounts to information stored on smartphones, where privacy concerns might be greater.

German attorney Chan-jo Jun had filed a complaint with prosecutors in Munich in 2016 and demanded Facebook executives be compelled to comply with anti-hate speech laws by deleting racist or violent postings from its site.  Jun compiled a list of about 440 postings that were flagged as inappropriate but not deleted over a period of a year. His complaint named Facebook founder and chief executive Zuckerberg and nine other managers, including Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg.  Facebook could not immediately be reached for comment.

Reels\u2019 debut comes days after Microsoft said it was in talks to acquire TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations from China\u2019s ByteDance. ByteDance has agreed to divest parts of TikTok, sources have said, under pressure from the White House, which has threatened to ban it and other Chinese-owned apps over data security concerns.  The launch escalates a bruising fight between Facebook and TikTok, with each casting the other as a threat. Both have been eager to attract American teenagers, many of whom have flocked to TikTok in the last two years.  Reels was first tested in Brazil in 2018 and then later in France, Germany and India, which was TikTok\u2019s biggest market until the Indian government banned it last month following a border clash with China. Facebook also tried out a standalone app called Lasso which did not gain much traction.  Similar to TikTok, Reels users can record short mobile-friendly vertical videos, then add special effects and soundtracks pulled from a music library.  Those similarities led TikTok Chief Executive Kevin Mayer to call Reels a \u201ccopycat product\u201d that could coast on Instagram\u2019s enormous existing user base after \u201ctheir other copycat Lasso failed quickly.\u201d  Facebook faced similar charges at a congressional hearing on U.S. tech companies\u2019 alleged abuse of market power last week, with lawmakers suggesting the company has copied rivals like Snapchat for anti-competitive reasons.  Vishal Shah, Instagram\u2019s vice president of product, acknowledged the similarities in a Tuesday video conference call with reporters and said that \u201cinspiration for products comes from everywhere,\u201d including Facebook\u2019s teams and \u201cthe ecosystem more broadly.\u201d  Instagram is not yet planning to offer advertising or other ways for users to make money through Reels, although it did recruit young online stars like dancer Merrick Hanna and musician Tiagz - who was recently signed by Sony\/ATV after rising to fame via TikTok memes - to test the product ahead of launch.  The company paid the creators for production costs, Shah said.  Joe Gagliese, chief executive of influencer marketing agency Viral Nation, said Reels was poised to mimic Instagram\u2019s success with Stories, a product modeled on Snapchat\u2019s core offering.  \u201cThey\u2019re a huge monstrous threat (to TikTok),\u201d he said. \u201cThe current turmoil couldn\u2019t be playing more into (Instagram\u2019s) court to launch this thing.\u201d","479":"(Reuters) - Some of the biggest, highest-profile U.S. hedge fund investors and money managers fell back in love with FAANGs in the first quarter, according to regulatory filings released on Wednesday.

Netflix shares gained 2.7% to close at $354.99 and Facebook gained 3.1% to close at $186.27.  FAANG\u2019s return to vogue in 2019 has mostly outpaced the broader market\u2019s recovery, with Netflix surging 33% year to date, despite slowing user expansion and the threat of Walt Disney Co\u2019s upcoming video streaming service. Facebook has surged more than 40% in 2019 as investors bet that regulatory threats and calls to break up the world\u2019s largest social network will not endanger its meteoric growth in ad sales.

FILE PHOTO: Silhouettes of mobile users are seen next to a screen projection of Facebook logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  The government, led by Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare, told Reuters it would issue a formal statement on its decision later on Tuesday.  If the ban goes ahead, the Solomons would join only a handful of countries around the world, including China, Iran and North Korea, to actively restrict the world\u2019s biggest social networking platform.  A Facebook Inc spokeswoman said the company was contacting the Solomons government to discuss the issue.  \u201cThis move will impact thousands of people in the Solomon Islands who use our services to connect and engage in important discussions across the Pacific,\u201d the spokeswoman said.  The government has been heavily criticised on social media over the distribution of economic stimulus funds amid the coronavirus pandemic and the impact of the Pacific nation\u2019s decision to switch diplomatic ties from Taiwan to China.  Solomon\u2019s Minister of Communication, Peter Shanel Agovaka, is one of the chief supporters of the ban, according to the Solomon Times, and has blamed \u201cabusive language\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d of government ministers, including the prime minister, being carried on the platform for the decision.  Facebook is a hugely popular forum for discussion in the Solomons with its population of around 650,000 spread out over a sprawling archipelago. The government also uses Facebook to broadcast speeches by the prime minister and to disseminate health information during the pandemic.  Opposition leader Matthew Wale told Reuters he would oppose the move.  \u201cPoliticians are always worried about people having access to information and being able to freely express their views - that really cannot be grounds for proposing a ban,\u201d Wale told Reuters on the phone.  \u201cI absolutely do not see any justification whatsoever for such a ban.\u201d","482":"BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Commission announced draft rules on Tuesday to rein in tech giants such as Alphabet\u2019s Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon, the most significant among a raft of measures taken by regulators worldwide.  FILE PHOTO: European Union flags flutter in front of the European Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, October 2, 2019. REUTERS\/Yves Herman  Here is what European Union regulators hope to achieve, and the factors that will affect the final legislation expected to be adopted in the coming months, or possibly longer.  WHAT ARE THE EU DRAFT RULES?  There are two sets of rules, the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA), with the latter in effect replacing the 20-year-old e-Commerce Directive.  The DMA targets online gatekeepers - companies that control data and access to their platforms - which thousands of businesses and millions of Europeans rely on for their work or social interactions.  Gatekeepers are defined as companies with more than 6.5 billion euros in annual European turnover in the last three years or 65 billion euros ($79 billion) in market value in the last financial year, and provide a core platform service in at least three EU countries.  Other criteria include having more than 45 million monthly users in Europe and more than 10,000 business users. Such companies could be online search engines, social networking services, cloud computing services and advertising services.  They face a list of dos - such as sharing certain kinds of data with rivals and regulators - and don\u2019ts - among them a halt to favouring their own services on their platforms or harvesting data from their platforms to compete with their business users.  They will also be required to inform regulators of planned takeovers, a move aimed at preventing so-called killer acquisitions, or buying smaller rivals to kill them off.  Rule breakers face fines as high as 10% of their annual global turnover, while repeat offenders can be broken up as a last resort.  The DSA also targets very large online platforms, defined as companies with more than 45 million users in Europe.  The tech giants are required to do more to tackle illegal content such as hate speech and child sexual abuse material, misuse of their platforms that impinges on fundamental rights, and intentional manipulation of platforms, such as using bots to influence elections and public health.  The companies will be required to publish details of their online advertisers and show the parameters used by their algorithms to suggest and rank information. Independent auditors will monitor compliance, while EU countries will enforce the rules.  WHY THE TOUGH EU LINE AGAINST TECH GIANTS NOW?  EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager has grown increasingly frustrated over the slow pace of investigations into the sector, due in part to legal requirements for defendants to present their case. Ten years on, three antitrust cases and more than 8 billion euros ($9.7 billion) in fines against Google, Vestager is still dogged by complaints from hundreds of Google critics that she has failed to stop anti-competitive behaviour.  For EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, the best solution is rules to show the tech giants that they are not too big to be tamed.  WHAT COMES NEXT?  The Commission will have to thrash out the final legislation together with the 27 countries in the bloc and the European Parliament, a process that could take months or even a year or more.  WHAT DO EU COUNTRIES AND LAWMAKERS SAY?  France and the Netherlands in September issued a joint paper urging the EU executive to take a tough line against tech giants, suggesting a number of measures identical to the ones proposed on Tuesday.  For the Dutch, the call marks a departure from their traditional liberal line.  Germany is also a fan of stronger measures against tech giants, while its antitrust agency has already taken action against Facebook and Amazon.  The Czech government, on the other hand, has cautioned against over-regulation. Ireland, home to the European headquarters of Google, Facebook and Twitter, is likely to fight for a moderate regulatory approach.  European Parliament lawmakers are expected to back the Commission\u2019s approach.  WHAT CAN TECH GIANTS DO ABOUT THIS THREAT TO THEIR BUSINESS?  The tech giants, which have called for proportionate and balanced rules that will not slow down innovation, are expected to redouble their efforts to water down the draft rules.  Recent EU legislation, such as the platform-to-business and copyright rules, were both more lenient than they had originally feared, due in part to their fierce lobbying with EU countries and EU lawmakers.  Don\u2019t expect a group approach, though. With companies moving into their rivals\u2019 territory, the tech giants are sniping at each other as well.  Facebook for example wants the EU to crack down on Apple for controlling an entire ecosystem from device to app store and apps and allegedly using this power to harm developers, consumers and large platforms. Apple rejects such accusations.  WHAT DOES THE UNITED STATES THINK ABOUT THE PROPOSALS?  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce criticised the proposals, saying they target U.S. companies almost exclusively with onerous new regulatory requirements backed by steep financial penalties.  WHERE ELSE IS THE REGULATORY ACTION?  Last week, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and a big coalition of states sued Facebook, saying that it broke antitrust law. Amazon is also in the FTC\u2019s crosshairs.  That followed a U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) lawsuit in October that accused Google of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals, a move which could lead to the break-up of the company. Apple is also the subject of a DoJ investigation.  The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has similarly called for sweeping changes to rein in how Google and Facebook use local content and consumer data.  India\u2019s antitrust body CCI is investigating allegations that Google abuses its market position to promote its payments app, in the smart TV market and via its mobile Android operating system.  CCI is also probing Amazon and rival Flipkart, owned by Walmart, over alleged violations of competition law and certain discounting practices, which Amazon is challenging.  In addition, Britain has proposed new rules to crack down on tech companies.

The independent board, which some have dubbed Facebook\u2019s \u201cSupreme Court,\u201d will be able to overturn decisions by the company and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg on whether individual pieces of content should be allowed on Facebook and Instagram.  Facebook has long faced criticism for high-profile content moderation issues. They range from temporarily removing a famous Vietnam-era war photo of a naked girl fleeing a napalm attack, to failing to combat hate speech in Myanmar against the Rohingya and other Muslims.  The oversight board will focus on a small slice of challenging content issues including hate speech and harassment and people\u2019s safety.  Facebook said the board\u2019s members have lived in 27 countries and speak at least 29 languages, though a quarter of the group and two of the four co-chairs are from the United States, where the company is headquartered.  The co-chairs, who selected the other members jointly with Facebook, are former U.S. federal circuit judge and religious freedom expert Michael McConnell, constitutional law expert Jamal Greene, Colombian attorney Catalina Botero-Marino and former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt.  Among the initial cohort are: former European Court of Human Rights judge Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3, Internet Sans Fronti\u00e8res Executive Director Julie Owono, Yemeni activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Tawakkol Karman, former editor-in-chief of the Guardian Alan Rusbridger, and Pakistani digital rights advocate Nighat Dad.  Nick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s head of global affairs, told Reuters in a Skype interview the board\u2019s composition was important but that its credibility would be earned over time.  \u201cI don\u2019t expect people to say, \u2018Oh hallelujah, these are great people, this is going to be a great success\u2019 - there\u2019s no reason anyone should believe that this is going to be a great success until it really starts hearing difficult cases in the months and indeed years to come,\u201d he said.  The board will start work immediately and Clegg said it would begin hearing cases this summer.  The board, which will grow to about 40 members and which Facebook has pledged $130 million to fund for at least six years, will make public, binding decisions on controversial cases where users have exhausted Facebook\u2019s usual appeals process.  The company can also refer significant decisions to the board, including on ads or on Facebook groups. The board can make policy recommendations to Facebook based on case decisions, to which the company will publicly respond.  Initially, the board will focus on cases where content was removed and Facebook expects it to take on only \u201cdozens\u201d of cases to start, a small percentage of the thousands it expects will be brought to the board.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cWe are not the internet police, don\u2019t think of us as sort of a fast-action group that\u2019s going to swoop in and deal with rapidly moving problems,\u201d co-chair McConnell said on a conference call.  The board\u2019s case decisions must be made and implemented within 90 days, though Facebook can ask for a 30-day review for exceptional cases.  \u201cWe\u2019re not working for Facebook, we\u2019re trying to pressure Facebook to improve its policies and its processes to better respect human rights. That\u2019s the job,\u201d board member and internet governance researcher Nicolas Suzor told Reuters. \u201cI\u2019m not so naive that I think that that\u2019s going to be a very easy job.\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  He said board members had differing views on freedom of expression and when it can legitimately be curtailed.  John Samples, vice president of the libertarian Cato Institute, has praised Facebook\u2019s decision not to remove a doctored video of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Saj\u00f3 has cautioned against allowing the \u201coffended\u201d to have too much influence in the debate around online expression.  Some free speech and internet governance experts told Reuters they thought the board\u2019s first members were a diverse, impressive group, though some were concerned it was too heavy on U.S. members. Facebook said one reason for that was that some of its hardest decisions or appeals in recent years had begun in America.  \u201cI don\u2019t feel like they made any daring choices,\u201d said Jillian C. York, the Electronic Frontier Foundation\u2019s director of international freedom of expression.  Jes Kaliebe Petersen, CEO of Myanmar tech-focused civil society organization Phandeeyar, said he hoped the board would apply more \u201cdepth\u201d to moderation issues, compared with Facebook\u2019s universal set of community standards.  David Kaye, U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression, said the board\u2019s efficacy would be shown when it started hearing cases.  \u201cThe big question,\u201d he said, \u201cwill be, are they taking questions that might result in decisions, or judgments as this is a court, that go against Facebook\u2019s business interests?\u201d","486":"DUBLIN, May 31 (Reuters) - Ireland\u2019s Supreme Court on Friday dismissed a bid by Facebook to block a landmark privacy case, regarding the transfer of EU users\u2019 data to the United States, being referred to Europe\u2019s top court.  The case, launched by Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems, is the latest to question whether methods used by technology firms to transfer data outside the 28-nation European Union give EU consumers sufficient protection from U.S. surveillance.

Also departing is WhatsApp Vice President Chris Daniels, adding to a string of recent high-profile exits from Facebook\u2019s product and communications teams.  Facebook, Twitter and Google were also facing another round of public discussions over extremist content on their platforms on Friday, after video footage of mass shootings in New Zealand was live streamed and widely shared online.  \u201cThe live-streaming of New Zealand\u2019s shooting will certainly bring on more questions of regulation and scrutiny over Facebook. It helped provide a platform for today\u2019s horrific attack and will undoubtedly be called into question for facilitating the spread of this,\u201d said Clement Thibault, analyst at global financial markets platform Investing.com.  The gunman, who was part of attacks that killed 49 people in New Zealand, broadcast live footage on Facebook of the attack on one of the mosques, leading to calls for more content moderation by the social network.  Britain\u2019s interior minister Sajid Javid said social media firms must take action to stop extremism on their channels after Friday\u2019s shootings.  \u201cYou really need to do more @YouTube @Google @facebook @Twitter to stop violent extremism being promoted on your platforms,\u201d Javid wrote on Twitter.  The social media companies have said they would take down content involving the mass shootings, which were posted online as the attack unfolded.  Facebook has been investing heavily to weed out fake content from its platform and has hired thousands of employees for moderating content and suspended hundreds of suspicious accounts in different countries.  The company\u2019s shares were down 2.5 percent at $165.83 in midday trade.","490":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc reported better-than-expected profit on Wednesday, showing that digital advertisers were still flocking to spend money on the service in order to reach customers even after a series of high profile embarrassments for the world\u2019s largest online social media network.  Investors have worried that Facebook\u2019s pledge to invest heavily to improve its privacy and security standards would blunt the company\u2019s growth, but its fourth-quarter results appeared to soothe those concerns, sending its stock price up more than 11 percent after hours.  \u201cThe worst is over for this social media giant,\u201d said Haris Anwar, an analyst at Investing.com: \u201cIts ad business and user engagement haven\u2019t been affected despite all the negative blows of the past year.\u201d  The company has struggled with scandals over improperly shared customer data and propaganda on its service that tarnished its image and made it the target of political scrutiny across the globe last year.  That has not significantly harmed advertising, where Facebook makes the vast majority of its revenue. Although ad prices have fallen, Facebook has been showing more ads, particularly on its Instagram app, as it finds users crave daily visual updates from friends, family and celebrities enough to sift past commercials and photo ads every few seconds.  The number of ad impressions across Facebook\u2019s system accelerated each quarter last year compared to the prior year\u2019s quarters, as Facebook moved more aggressively in generating revenue from Instagram after its initial caution on using that strategy, for fear of turning off users.  Total fourth-quarter revenue rose 30 percent to $16.9 billion from $12.97 billion, its slowest quarterly revenue growth in more than six years as a public company. It was, however, above analysts\u2019 average estimate of $16.4 billion.  Net income rose to $6.88 billion, or $2.38 per share, up from $4.27 billion, or $1.44 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $2.19 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

These results will go a long way towards regaining the trust of Wall Street.\u201d  Facebook shares rose more than 11 percent to $168.20 after the bell. They closed up 4.3 percent in regular trading.  MORE STORIES, MORE MESSAGES  Facebook managed to increase sales despite a 2 percent drop in the average price per ad in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, as its ad views came from less lucrative areas such as Instagram\u2019s Stories feature and developing markets.  It was the first price decline since the final quarter of 2012, when Facebook lowered prices to stoke demand in emerging markets, but the company appeared to make up for the drop in overall sales volume.  Executives said on a conference call after reporting earnings that they would focus this year on finding new ways to push ads.  \u201cPeople are creating more Stories and sending more messages, which means these are emerging areas of opportunity for marketers,\u201d said Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg.  The higher sales figures helped offset total expenses, which surged in the fourth quarter to $9.1 billion, up 62 percent compared with a year ago. The operating margin fell to 46 percent in the fourth quarter from 57 percent a year ago.  Facebook\u2019s shares have lost a third of their value since July, when it first warned about slowing growth in revenue and operating margin. Despite Wednesday\u2019s bump, its share price remains near its lowest point in two years.  Facebook said on its conference call that total revenue growth rate this quarter would decelerate by mid-single digits, excluding currency fluctuations, compared to the fourth quarter, and continue to slow throughout the year.  It said it continued to expect 2019 total expenses to grow about 40 percent to 50 percent compared with 2018.  GRAPHIC-Facebook costs: tmsnrt.rs\/2HD7isF  Despite its privacy issues, Facebook managed to gain some new users, particularly in India, Indonesia and the Philippines.

The FBI and Biden\u2019s inauguration team did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Facebook report.  Violent rhetoric on online platforms had already ramped up in the weeks before last week\u2019s unrest as right-wing groups planned the assault, largely in open public view, according to researchers and public postings.  Lawmakers were forced to flee as the Capitol was mobbed by Trump loyalists, white nationalist groups and militias who overwhelmed security forces. Five people died in the violence, including a Capitol Police officer who was beaten as he tried to ward off the crowds.  After the unrest, tech companies took unprecedented steps to crack down on the baseless claims of election fraud that had spurred calls for violence. Twitter Inc and Facebook blocked Trump\u2019s accounts, while Amazon Web Services and the major mobile app stores cut off social media network Parler.  On Monday, Facebook banned content promoting the phrase \u201cstop the steal,\u201d which has become a rallying cry at armed pro-Trump protests. The company was also blocking searches for \u201cstorm the Capitol\u201d and flagging posts that include those phrases for further review, the spokeswoman said.  Under pressure from civil rights groups, Alphabet Inc\u2019s YouTube suspended Trump\u2019s channel for seven days.","498":"NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - A shareholder of Facebook Inc on Friday filed the first of what could be many lawsuits against the social media company and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg following a 19 percent one-day plunge in Facebook\u2019s share price.

Technology executives have traveled to Washington several times to testify in Congress over the past year, including 10 hours of questioning of Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg over two days in April.  The committee has been looking into reported Russian efforts to influence U.S. public opinion for more than a year, after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that entities backed by the Kremlin had sought to boost Republican Donald Trump\u2019s chances of winning the White House in 2016.

Allegations of Russian involvement in Trump\u2019s 2016 victory have dogged his presidency. He has come under fire for discounting the threat of interference in November\u2019s impending elections, when his fellow Republicans\u2019 majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate are at stake.  As senators gathered for the hearing, Trump took to Twitter to urge Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end a federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, which he described as a \u201cTOTAL HOAX.\u201d  Both Republicans and Democrats at the hearing sought to make clear that foreign influence efforts extended beyond U.S. elections, and affected many countries.  \u201cThis is going on everywhere.

The board, which Facebook created in response to criticism of its handling of problematic content, said it had received 20,000 cases since it opened its doors in October.  Three of the six cases involved content that Facebook removed for breaking hate speech rules.  An Oversight Board spokesman said hate speech cases had been \u201cthe most significant proportion\u201d of appeals received.  \u201cHate speech is an especially difficult area,\u201d Jamal Greene, one of the board\u2019s co-chairs and a professor at Columbia Law School, told Reuters in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not that easy ... for an algorithm to get the context of\u201d such speech.  In November, Facebook for the first time disclosed numbers on the prevalence of hate speech on the platform, saying that out of every 10,000 content views in the third quarter, 10 to 11 included hate speech.  The global board's other chosen cases involved content removed from Facebook or Instagram for violating rules on adult nudity, dangerous individuals and organizations, and violence and incitement. Greene said they raised \"important line-drawing questions.\" (Link here to full list of cases)  One case was submitted by Facebook itself. The company said this case highlighted the challenge it faced when dealing with the risks of offline harm caused by misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic.  Facebook can also ask the board for non-binding policy recommendations, but Greene said it had not yet done so.  The board has opened a week-long public comment period on the first cases, which will be reviewed by five-member panels. There is a 90-day deadline for decisions on the cases to be reached and for Facebook to act on them.  The board, which has been criticized for its limited remit, aims to start hearing cases from users in early 2021 about content that has been left on the site as well as taken down.  This week, a group of Facebook critics dubbed \u201cThe Real Facebook Oversight Board\u201d said it would hear three cases not yet eligible for users to take to the official oversight board, including a dispute about the Facebook account of Steve Bannon, President Donald Trump\u2019s former adviser.

Reuters Fact Check. REUTERS  The five-minute clip was posted to Facebook on Nov. 11 but was deleted a day later. Captioned \u201cThe Four Year Plan To Overthrow An Elected President\u201d, it shows various photos and news clippings alongside a voiceover (other examples here and here ).  The video expresses numerous claims and opinions, but this article only has the scope to address some of the primary allegations.  THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WAS PLANNED  The video alleges \u201cplans for 2020 began immediately following the 2016 election\u201d and \u201cthe COVID hoax was in the works years before the election of Donald Trump, but they started fast tracking it.\u201d  Any suggestion that COVID-19 is a deliberately planned pandemic is false. The United States\u2019 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) explains the source of COVID-19 was most likely a large seafood and live animal market in Wuhan, China ( here ).  There is no indication or publicly available evidence suggesting that the coronavirus was \"designed\". As of Nov. 12, 2020, the World Health Organisation reported more than 50 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 1,275,000 deaths ( covid19.who.int\/ ).  Reuters has debunked numerous claims that the coronavirus pandemic was planned here , here , and here .  ANTHONY FAUCI PREDICTED THE 2020 PANDEMIC  The video claims that nine days before Trump\u2019s inauguration, U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said there is no doubt that President Trump will be confronted with a surprise infectious disease.  This statement is true, but it does not prove that the pandemic was planned. Conspiracy theories linking Fauci\u2019s comment with the COVID-19 pandemic circulated online in May and were debunked by the fact-checking website Snopes ( here ).  Fauci was speaking at a Georgetown University forum on pandemic preparedness in January 2017 when he said: \u201cThere is no question that there will be a challenge to the coming administration in the arena of infectious diseases\u2026there will also be a surprise outbreak.\u201d  The speech is visible here and here .  Fauci did not specifically warn of a pandemic in 2020 but spoke generally about the dangers of infectious diseases. The Obama administration had experienced the 2009 swine flu pandemic ( here ), the 2015-16 Zika virus epidemic ( here ) and the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak in West Africa ( here ).  BILL GATES WARNED OF A DEADLY PANDEMIC  The video claims that: \u201cTwo days after the President\u2019s inauguration Bill Gates spoke at Davos and warned of a coming deadly pandemic.\u201d  It is true that Gates discussed the risk of a global health crisis at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January 2017.  The billionaire philanthropist said: \u201cI think an epidemic\u2026is the most likely thing to cause, say, 10 million excess deaths, and that it\u2019s pretty surprising how little preparedness there is for it.\u201d The video can be seen here .  This comment is not evidence Gates was involved in the COVID-19 pandemic or in a plan to remove Trump from the White House.  Many instances of misinformation have referenced Gates and been debunked by Reuters ( here ).  THE VIRUS CAME FROM A LAB  The video alleges that Fauci became involved in studies to make viruses more infectious in 2017. This is true but does not prove that the 2020 pandemic was deliberately created or planned.  The U.S. government lifted a temporary ban on funding research where scientists made pathogens more transmissible in order to understand how they naturally evolve and could be used by others for biowarfare, according to a Reuters report from 2017 ( here ).  This research is unrelated to the origins of the 2020 pandemic. Many experts have said that the novel coronavirus originated in nature and was not man-made ( here and here ).  Vincent Racaniello, Higgins Professor at the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Columbia University, told Reuters via email: \u201cThere is quite an abundance of evidence\u2026that make it very clear that SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus that causes COVID-19) arose in nature, not in a laboratory.\u201d  As stated earlier, the CDC explained the source of COVID-19 was most likely a large seafood and live animal market in Wuhan ( here ).  EVENT 201 PREDICTED THE PANDEMIC  To corroborate the claim that the 2020 pandemic was planned, the video lists \u201cEvent 201\u201d as supporting evidence.  Event 201 was a real exercise that simulated the outbreak of an imagined coronavirus transmitted from bats to pigs on Brazilian farms before humans spread it globally by air travel. The event was organised in October 2019 by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security alongside the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  According to the event\u2019s website, the simulation intended to highlight \u201cimportant gaps in pandemic preparedness\u201d ( here ).  Conspiracy theories linking this event with the 2020 pandemic grew in April and were debunked by the fact-checking organisation Full Fact ( here ).  Event 201 highlighted the risks of a global outbreak but did not plan the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.  COVID-19 IS LESS DEADLY THAN THE COMMON COLD  The video claims that: \u201cFear is injected into the brainwashed masses over a virus that is less deadly than the common cold.\u201d  Claims that COVID-19 is less deadly than the common cold or seasonal flu have been debunked numerous times by Reuters ( here , here , here ).  Even though the majority of COVID-19 patients only experience mild or no symptoms, it is far more lethal than the common cold.  THE 2020 ELECTION WAS RIGGED  The video concludes that electoral fraud took place to ensure Trump could not win the 2020 U.S. election.  The speaker claims that: \u201cJust when Trump surges in key states, the election is inexplicably halted.\u201d Reuters has debunked claims that states stopped counting ballots and found votes for President-elect Joe Biden here and here .  The clip also alleges that thousands of mail-in ballots appeared \u201cin the middle of the night all for Biden\u201d. Reuters has fact-checked multiple allegations of voter fraud since election day, visible www.reuters.com\/fact-check .  Experts say election fraud is vanishingly rare in the United States, where nearly one in four voters cast a mail-in or absentee ballot in 2016 ( here ) .  Other conspiracy theories surrounding the US election have been debunked by Reuters www.reuters.com\/fact-check .  VERDICT  False. The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic was not planned to overthrow Trump.

So-called wallets for crypto-payments are akin to bank accounts that are subject to a welter of rules, such as deposit insurance, liquidity and capital requirements.  The European Union on Tuesday said it will propose a new law to cover crypto-asset projects like Libra, saying they posed a risk to the wider financial system.  Unlike the EU, the Bank of England\u2019s FPC said that for now, it will apply its principles by applying existing supervisory \u201ctools\u201d, rather than resorting to new rules.  The FPC also said it will set out in December changes it would like to see in so-called open ended funds following a review by the Bank and the Financial Conduct Authority.  High-profile fund manager Neil Woodford had to suspend his flagship fund in June, trapping thousands of investors. The fund offered daily redemptions to customers but it ran out of cash because some of the assets could not be quickly sold.  Britain, however, may not be able to introduce all the fund rule changes itself as some will need backing from international regulators.  In its statement on Wednesday, the FPC signaled a possible crack down on banks that are slow to stop using the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, as a price reference in financial contracts.  Banks have been fined billions of dollars for trying to rig Libor and the FPC wants lenders to shift to using Sonia, an overnight sterling-denominated interest rate benchmark compiled by the central bank.  \u201cThere is no justification for firms continuing to increase their exposure to Libor,\u201d the FPC said.  The risk watchdog said it will consider further \u201cpotential policy and supervisory tools\u201d during the fourth quarter to reduce the stock of legacy Libor contracts.

The proposed rules, to be announced by EU digital chief Thierry Breton and EU antitrust czar Margrethe Vestager on Tuesday, are likely to affect Amazon.com, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet unit Google.  The rules, known as the Digital Markets Act, set out a list of dos and don\u2019ts for online gatekeepers to ensure a level playing field for rivals and users.  That could include requiring dominant companies to share certain kinds of data with rivals and regulators, while practices such as companies favouring their own services could be outlawed.  Breton has previously said that gatekeepers can be ordered to change their practices or even be forced to break up their European businesses for repeated breaches of the rules.  The criteria for classifying which companies are gatekeepers are likely to be the number of users, either individual or business users on a pan-European level, a company\u2019s presence in at least two business sectors and revenues, other sources have told Reuters.

(Reuters) - Facebook Inc believes it could acquire other large companies without running afoul of antitrust enforcers if the world\u2019s largest social media network chose to enter a new market, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said on Tuesday.  Sandberg was asked on stage by a journalist at the Code Conference whether Facebook, because of its size, would be allowed in the future to buy companies as it has such as virtual reality firm Oculus and messaging service WhatsApp.  \u201cIt really depends what it is. If it was in something that wasn\u2019t core to what we were doing and a new area, like Oculus was, I think it would probably be allowed,\u201d Sandberg said.  She gave no indication that a deal was forthcoming.  Facebook, one of the largest corporations by market capitalization, has grown in part through acquisitions. In 2014 it bought WhatsApp for $22 billion and Oculus for $3 billion, but has not made a similar purchase since. It bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012.  EU regulators have expressed concern about a plan by Facebook and WhatsApp to begin sharing users\u2019 phone numbers and other data.  Sandberg said sharing data between the two services had benefits, such as catching people who exploit children, and that Facebook should not be broken up.  \u201cIf you are doing child-exploitative content, WhatsApp\u2019s encrypted, but we know who you are from Facebook. We can take your account down on WhatsApp, too,\u201d she said.","512":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc said on Thursday it was referring its decision to indefinitely suspend the accounts of former U.S. President Donald Trump to its independent oversight board.  Trump will remain suspended while the board, a recently created body that can overrule the company\u2019s decisions on content, reviews the decision.  Facebook blocked Trump\u2019s access to his Facebook and Instagram accounts over concerns of further violent unrest following the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol by the former president\u2019s supporters.  \u201cI\u2019m very confident of our case,\u201d Facebook\u2019s head of global affairs, Nick Clegg, told Reuters. \u201cI\u2019m very confident that any reasonable person looking at the circumstances in which we took that decision and looking at our existing policies will agree.\u201d  \u201cBut of course this is a decision which has had reverberations around the world,\u201d he added. It is the first time the company has blocked a current president, prime minister or head of state.  Facebook did not ask for an expedited review so the board, which said on Thursday it had accepted the case, will have a maximum of 90 days to make a ruling and for Facebook to act on it. An Oversight Board spokesman said it would likely be sooner than that.  The administrators of Trump\u2019s Facebook page will have the option to submit a written statement challenging Facebook\u2019s decision.

Facebook does not have to act on this recommendation, unlike the board\u2019s case decision which is meant to be binding.  The oversight board, which currently has 20 members, was created by Facebook in response to criticism of its handling of problematic content.  \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here, to not leave these decisions to the leadership of Facebook but actually use the Oversight Board to look at this in a principled way,\u201d said Helle Thorning-Schmidt, a board co-chair and the former Danish prime minister.  The board, which has been criticized for its delayed start and limited remit, has not yet ruled on its first batch of cases.  Facebook said when it suspended Trump that the block would last at least until the end of Trump\u2019s presidential term and perhaps indefinitely. Trump\u2019s term expired on Wednesday when Joe Biden was sworn in as president.  Twitter Inc has suspended Trump permanently.  \u2018CRYSTAL-CLEAR LINK\u2019  Trump was not made aware in advance of Facebook\u2019s decision to suspend him indefinitely, Clegg said.  \u201cWhilst it was a controversial decision because he was the president of the United States, it actually wasn\u2019t a particularly complicated one to take,\u201d he said, adding he felt there was a \u201ccrystal-clear link\u201d between the words of Trump and the actions of people at the Capitol.  Facebook and other social media companies have come under fire for the proliferation of violent rhetoric and election misinformation on their platforms, including by Trump and his allies. That criticism only increased around the unrest at the Capitol, which was also incited and organized on social platforms.  Asked if Facebook bears partial responsibility for the actions that led the storming of the Capitol, Clegg said: \u201cI accept there will always be people who say we knew this was going to happen. Dare I say it, I think it\u2019s never quite as straightforward as that.\u201d  He said he did not expect other major policy changes as a consequence of recent events.  \u201cI\u2019m ... keen not to raise expectations that because of one event we will therefore make very significant course corrections which then have to apply, because we\u2019re a global company with global standards, to the rest of the world as well,\u201d he said.","513":"FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen placed on a keyboard in this illustration taken March 25, 2020.

Austrian Max Schrems filed complaints against Google , Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing they were acting illegally by forcing users to accept intrusive terms of service or lose access.  That take-it-or-leave-it approach, Schrems told Reuters Television, violates people\u2019s right under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to choose freely whether to allow companies to use their data.  \u201cYou have to have a \u2018yes or no\u2019 option,\u201d Schrems said in an interview recorded in Vienna before he filed the complaints in various European jurisdictions.  \u201cA lot of these companies now force you to consent to the new privacy policy, which is totally against the law.\u201d  The GDPR overhauls data protection laws in the European Union that predate the rise of the internet and, most importantly, foresees fines of up to 4 percent of global revenues for companies that break the rules.  That puts potential sanctions in the ballpark of anti-trust fines levied by Brussels that, in Google\u2019s case, have run into billions of dollars.  Andrea Jelinek, who heads both Austria\u2019s Data Protection Authority and a new European Data Protection Board set up under GDPR, said she expected to see complaints come in as soon as the law enters force across the 28-member European Union.  SCOURGE OF FACEBOOK  Schrems was a 23-year-old law student when he first took on Facebook and he\u2019s been fighting Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s social network ever since - becoming the poster-boy for data privacy.  He won a landmark European court ruling in 2015 that invalidated a \u2018safe harbour\u2019 agreement that allowed firms to transfer personal data from the EU to the United States, where data protection is less strict.  With GDPR in mind, he recently set up a non-profit called None of Your Business noyb.eu (noyb) that plans legal action to blunt the ability of the tech titans to harvest data that they then use to sell targeted advertising.  His laptop perched on the table of a traditional Viennese coffee house, Schrems showed how a pop-up message on Facebook seeks consent to use his data - and how he is blocked when he refuses.  \u201cThe only way is to really accept it, otherwise you cannot use your Facebook any more,\u201d Schrems explained.  \u201cAs you can see, I have my messages there and I cannot read them unless I agree.\u201d  Erin Egan, Facebook\u2019s chief privacy officer, said in a statement that the company has prepared for 18 months to ensure it meets the requirements of GDPR by making its policies clearer and its privacy settings easier to find.  Facebook, which has more than 2 billion regular users, has also said that advertising allows it to remain free, and that the whole service, including ads, is meant to be personalized based on user data.  \u201c1,000-EURO BRICK\u201d  Schrems said, however, that Instagram, a photo-sharing network popular with younger users, and encrypted messaging service WhatsApp - both owned by Facebook - also use pop-ups to gain consent and bar users who refuse.  The action brought by noyb against Google relates to new smartphones using its Android operating system. Buyers are required to hand over their data or else own \u201ca 1,000-euro brick\u201d that they can\u2019t use, Schrems said.  Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  noyb is filing the four claims with data protection authorities in France, Belgium, Germany and Austria. Ensuing litigation may play out in Ireland, where both Facebook and Google have their European headquarters.  One filing, made against Facebook on behalf of an Austrian woman, asks the country\u2019s data protection authority to investigate and, as appropriate, prohibit data processing operations based on invalid consent.  It also asks the regulator to impose \u201ceffective, proportionate and dissuasive\u201d fines as foreseen by GDPR, which in Facebook\u2019s case could run to 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion).  \u201cSo far it was cheaper just to ignore privacy rights,\u201d said Schrems. \u201cNow, hopefully, it\u2019s going to be cheaper to follow them because the penalties are so high.\u201d ($1 = 0.8555 euros) (Additional reporting by David Ingram in San Francisco and Julia Fioretti in Brussels Writing by Douglas Busvine Editing by Keith Weir)","515":"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia\u2019s competition regulator has warned that planned laws to make the country the first in the world to force Google and Facebook to pay for news content were likely just the start of more regulation for digital platforms.  The Australian government announced legislation last month after an investigation it said showed the tech giants held too much market power in the media industry, a situation it said posed a potential threat to a well-functioning democracy.  Under the code, Google and Facebook will be subject to mandatory price arbitration if a commercial agreement on payment for Australian media cannot be reached.  \u201cThis bargaining code is a journey, if we see market power elsewhere, we can add them to the code,\u201d Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chairman (ACCC) Rod Sims said in an interview for Reuters Next.  Digital platforms face fines of up to A$10 million ($7.7 million) if they do not comply with the decision.  At the heart of the planned Australian regulation is a \u201ctwo-way value exchange\u201d to be used by an arbitrator to make a binding decision. That requires Facebook and Google to consider the value they receive from using Australian media content. It also requires local media companies to consider the value they receive from Facebook and Google users viewing their content.  Some Australian media organizations are unhappy with the two-way aspect of the code, and critics have noted that other players like Facebook\u2019s Instagram and Google\u2019s Youtube are not part of the legislation.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Google, meanwhile, has declared the code unworkable, citing in particular a requirement to provide publishers with two weeks\u2019 notice of certain changes to algorithms and internal practice.  Sims said the regulatory code was the best approach to ensure a level playing field, noting that competition laws around the world had failed to stop Facebook and Google gaining significant market power.  \u201cLet\u2019s see how it goes; no point trying to optimise now,\u201d Sims said in an interview on Dec. 21 that was broadcast at the event on Tuesday.  The Australian law, which has broad political support and is expected to be voted on in parliament early this year, was formulated after an ACCC inquiry that found for every A$100 of online advertising spend, $53 goes to Google, $28 to Facebook and A$19 to other media companies.  The ACCC has focused more and more on the rapidly growing market power of Google and Facebook. It has two inquiries open into advertising technology and mobile app stores, with reports due in January and in March, respectively.  Sims, who expressed concern about excessive pricing and self-preferencing by the app stores, said the reports would show the state of play and added that the regulator would continue to focus on data concerns in 2021.  \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that not just Australia, but companies overseas will benefit from what we find,\u201d Sims said.

The messaging service became part of the political battleground in Brazil\u2019s presidential election last October, with far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro facing claims of using the app to spread falsehoods related to his main opponent.

REUTERS\/Regis Duvignau\/Illustration  Critics of the law, which takes effect on Jan. 1, 2019, say it gives Hanoi more power to crack down on dissent because it would require Facebook, Google GOOGL.O and other global technology firms to store locally personal data on users in Vietnam and open offices in the country.  \u201cActing information minister Nguyen Manh Hung suggested Facebook, given its successful business in Vietnam, should reserve revenue to invest in research and development and soon open an office in Vietnam,\u201d the official government website said late on Thursday.  A spokeswoman for Facebook said she had no comment.  Despite sweeping economic reforms and growing openness to social change, the ruling Communist Party tolerates little dissent and exercises strict control over media in Vietnam.  Global tech firms have pushed back against the provisions for locally-stored data, but they have not taken the same tough stance on the parts of the law which bolster the government\u2019s ability to crackdown on online political activism.  Company officials have, however, privately expressed concerns that local data centers and offices could make it easier for the authorities to seize customer data and expose local employees to the threat of arrest.

Britain\u2019s top financial regulator said there was not yet enough information to understand Libra, adding that the project could be very significant for public policy and that it would not easily get the go-ahead without further disclosure.  \u201cThey are not going to walk through authorisation without that,\u201d Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, told a British parliamentary committee.  Facebook last week announced plans to launch Libra within the first half of 2020, part of an effort to expand beyond social media to e-commerce and digital payments.  Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin remain one of the least-regulated areas of finance, and the response of domestic and international financial regulators and monetary authorities to the Libra project will have a crucial impact on its prospects.  Facebook\u2019s project raised privacy concerns among U.S. lawmakers and prompted European central bankers to claim oversight to ensure it would not jeopardise the financial system or be used to launder money.  Until now, global central bankers have largely refrained from regulating digital currencies, concluding last year they were too small to pose a risk to the financial system.  The FCA\u2019s Bailey said the watchdog had been in contact with Facebook, and that many more engagements could be expected, while Domenico Gammaldi, the Bank of Italy\u2019s head of market and payment system oversight, also called for further information.  \u201cThe white paper, that means \u2018white,\u2019 without any information,\u201d Gammaldi told the Crypto Valley Conference in Zug.  PLAY BY THE RULES  Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said that Libra would have to respect anti-money laundering regulations and its backers would have to seek a banking licence if it was to offer services such as deposits.  France is using its year-long presidency of the Group of Seven nations (G7) to set up a task force to tackle such concerns at an international level.  Other central bankers were more sanguine about the project for which Facebook has recruited 28 partners including Mastercard, PayPal and Uber to form the Geneva-based Libra Association to govern the cryptocurrency.  \u201cI think it\u2019s an interesting development and I\u2019m pretty relaxed about it,\u201d Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the Swiss National Bank\u2019s governing board said.  \u201cThey have clearly indicated that they are willing to play according to the rules, they have been contacting the regulators,\u201d Moser said at the Crypto Valley Conference.

REUTERS\/Aaron P. Bernstein  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is pushing the wrong kind of independence. The social network\u2019s chief executive on Thursday revealed he plans to set up an external committee to help police fake news and hateful content. The move follows yet more revelations about how poorly he and others dealt with Russian meddling in U.S. elections. Outsourcing decisions won\u2019t fix Facebook\u2019s culture, though. Removing Zuckerberg as chair would be a step in the right direction.  The New York Times on Wednesday published a devastating report detailing a series of bad calls made by Zuckerberg and his second-in-command, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. The team ignored warning signs that Kremlin-backed operatives were using the network to sway voters during the 2016 presidential election and downplayed the damage of hateful content spreading to its some 2 billion users. Facebook even tried to deflect criticism by deploying a research outfit to spread negative articles about their rivals in conservative media.  Zuckerberg is still relying heavily on his apology playbook. He explained, frequently, during a Thursday call with reporters that Facebook has \u201cmade a lot of progress\u201d but \u201cstill has a lot of work to do.\u201d  One of those initiatives involves an independent committee to make decisions about free expression. Details, including who might be on the board, are sparse. But chances are slim that the $400 billion outfit can easily pass the buck of monitoring content without consequences.  Over the past 18 months or so a pattern has emerged at Facebook of poor decision-making and lapsed judgement. For instance, as insiders realized the scope of Moscow\u2019s campaign, Zuckerberg was largely absent: In 2017 he was on what he called a \u201clistening tour\u201d across America, milking cows and eating pie.  More fundamental change is required at the heart of the company. That\u2019s hard with Zuckerberg being chairman, CEO and, thanks to supervoting stock, in control of shareholder votes. But replacing him as head of the board with a strong outsider would be a good way both to ease the burden of an over-taxed executive suite and bring in a spark of independent leadership the company so desperately needs.","526":"April 17 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc is working on a voice assistant to rival the likes of Amazon.com Inc's Alexa, Apple Inc's Siri and Alphabet Inc's Google Assistant, CNBC reported here on Wednesday, citing several people familiar with the matter.

FILE PHOTO: Facebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks at the Viva Tech start-up and technology summit in Paris, France, May 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Charles Platiau  The result represents another victory for Zuckerberg and his fellow executives and directors, who control about 58% of voting rights at Facebook through their ownership of a special class of shares which carry 10 times the voting power of standard shares.  The voting imbalance means Zuckerberg, who co-founded Facebook in his Harvard University dorm room, has been able to resist change even as his company comes under pressure from investors over data privacy and its role in elections, which have attracted scrutiny from regulators.  Most publicly traded U.S. companies allow shareholders to cast advisory votes on the compensation of their highest executives, known as a \u2018say on pay\u2019 vote, but the frequency of such a ballot is not fixed.  Given a number of options, 4.4 billion votes were cast to have the pay of Zuckerberg and other top executives subject to an advisory ballot every three years, while 1.2 billion votes were cast in favor of having an annual advisory ballot, according to a regulatory filing made by Facebook on Monday.  Assuming the roughly 4 billion votes controlled by Zuckerberg and other executives and directors backed the three-year option, as the company recommended, that means about three-quarters of outside shareholders wanted an annual vote. Such a lopsided count would likely lead to change at most U.S. corporations.  A Facebook representative declined to comment. The company last held a \u2018say on pay\u2019 vote in 2016 and will next vote on the frequency of the votes in 2025.  Other measures proposed to give shareholders more power were also voted down, again showing the insiders\u2019 clout.  Trillium Asset Management\u2019s proposal for an independent board chair won about two-thirds of support from outsiders, up from about half that a similar proposal got in 2017, according to Trillium. That was still not enough to overcome the power of the insiders who presumably followed the company\u2019s recommendation against the proposal.  \u201cThe last two years of unending revelations, controversies, and damaging missteps combined with a dramatic loss of trust in the company, plus a realization that concentrating so much power in one person is unwise, has led to this vote,\u201d said Trillium Senior Vice President Jonas Kron.  A majority of outside votes cast did in fact back Facebook\u2019s executive pay in this year\u2019s vote. Zuckerberg, whose net worth is about $61 billion according to Forbes.com, was paid $1 in salary last year plus $22.6 million in other compensation, largely for security.","528":"FILE PHOTO: The Whatsapp logo and binary cyber codes are seen in this illustration taken November 26, 2019.

Underscoring Facebook\u2019s relative fall from grace, the Menlo Park, California-based company dropped to the 23rd spot in Glassdoor\u2019s list of \u201cBest Places to Work\u201d in 2020 from seventh place a year ago.","531":"FILE PHOTO: A 3D printed Whatsapp logo is placed on the keyboard in this illustration taken April 12, 2020.

The move to facilitate calls over large screens would put WhatsApp on par with video-conferencing bigwigs Zoom and Google Meet, but it is unclear if it has ambitions to compete with the two in the enterprise space.  With over 2 billion users globally, WhatsApp is second only to its parent firm Facebook Inc\u2019s namesake app, yet it is largely used for personal calls, unlike Zoom or Google Meet.  WhatsApp said it has already rolled out the feature to some desktop users on a trial basis in time for the holiday season, a move first reported by tech blog WABetaInfo.  A second wave of the coronavirus has forced many people around the world to stay home and plan gatherings with friends and family over the internet instead.  Zoom Video Communications Inc said on Friday it was removing the 40-minute time limit for its free accounts on all meetings globally for the holiday season.  In a similar move, Google Meet has said free users would not have to limit conversations to 60 minutes until March.","532":"A post on Facebook makes multiple claims about the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 presidential election. These claims are false.  Reuters Fact Check. REUTERS  An example of the post can be seen here .  The post makes various claims about COVID-19 and claims that mail-in ballots were the only way the Democrats could win the election. It does not give a source or any evidence for these claims.  WORLD IN LOCKDOWN OVER U.S. ELECTION  The post also claims that the world is in lockdown because of the U.S. elections, not the virus.  COVID-19 was discovered by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Dec. 31, 2019 following reports from Wuhan, China. The WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advise the public to help slow the spread of COVID-19 by maintaining a 6 feet distance from others, frequently washing hands and wearing a mask.  Reuters Fact Check has previously debunked various claims on the virus being a hoax here , here , here and here .  Countries around the world (and that were not in an election year) have imposed varying levels of lockdown to slow the spread of the virus. The University of Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker provides an interactive map here , that show restrictions for most countries.  With more 65 million cases and more than 1.5 million deaths, it is clear that the lockdowns are due to restrict the spread of virus (here).  There is no evidence to support the claim that the world is on lockdown because of the United States election.  COVID-19 IS JUST \u201cA VERY BAD FLU\u201d  COVID-19 is different from the flu in various ways, making it difficult to prove that a case of COVID-19 is just a very bad case of the influenza virus.  John Hopkins Medicine explains on its website that while 290,000 to 650,000 people die from the influenza virus each year, there have been more than 1.5 million deaths reported so far from the COVID-19 virus. (here )  A U.S. study showed that complication rates are higher for those infected with severe COVID-19 than with severe flu (here).  COVID-19 and the influenza virus have similar symptoms such as fever, fatigue, cough, aches and headaches. Unlike the influenza virus, COVID-19 can cause a loss of taste or sense of smell, and appears to be more contagious than the flu ( here and here ).  Reuters Fact Check has previously debunked various flu-related coronavirus claims here , here , here and here .  COVID-19 IS A BIOWEAPON  The U.S. CDC explains the source of COVID-19 was most likely a large seafood and live animal market in Wuhan, China (here).  There is no indication or publicly available evidence suggesting that the coronavirus was \"designed\" (for more on this: here , here ).  COVID-19 DIES WHEN TEMPERATURE REACHED 73 DEGREES  WHO explains on its website that warm temperatures do not prevent or cure COVID-19. (here) UNICEF debunked this claim here , pointing out that many people were also infected in countries such as Australia, Saudi Arabia and Libya, which have warmer climates.  Healthline reported the temperature at which the virus dies is much higher than 73 Fahrenheit (22.7 Celsius) (here).  PANDEMIC WAS JUST A WAY TO WIN ELECTION  The post claims that the only way the Democrats could win the election was to make the public afraid to vote in person due to the virus and that mail-in ballots helped the Democrats to win.  Reuters Fact Check previously debunked a claim that COVID-19 was created to eliminate President Donald J. Trump here .  President Trump claimed before the election, without evidence, that voter fraud could hand the presidency to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. Democrats sounded the alarm that voter intimidation and efforts to cast suspicion on mail-in ballots by Republicans would discourage minorities, in particular, from voting (here )  Despite the fears expressed on both sides, the election was deemed \u201cwell managed\u201d by international observers.  Trump told author Bob Woodward that he was aware of its risks but downplayed the danger of the virus, according to Woodward\u2019s new book \u201cRage\u201d (here).  \u201cI wanted to always play it down,\u201d Trump told author Bob Woodward on March 19, days after he declared a national emergency. \u201cI still like playing it down, because I don\u2019t want to create a panic.\u201d  There is no evidence to show that the pandemic was created so that the Democrats could win the election through mail-in ballots.

Representative Robert Goodlatte, a Republican who chairs the committee, said he was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d the companies did not testify.

The company\u2019s shares have sunk 16 percent, wiping more than $80 billion from its market value since March 16, when the New York Times and London\u2019s Observer newspaper broke news of the use of its data by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.  Some investors see the chaos as a chance to snap up shares in a service for which there is scarce alternative, despite rising public scrutiny and the prospect of a grilling from U.S. legislators when Zuckerberg testifies before Congress next week.  Canada\u2019s province of British Columbia and Canada\u2019s federal government combined investigations on Thursday, saying they had launched a joint probe into Facebook and Canadian data firm AggregateIQ, while Australian authorities said they were exploring whether the social media company had breached user privacy laws.  The California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, with nearly $1 billion in Facebook stock as of last year, on Thursday also said it would question the company about privacy protections.  Despite the probes and celebrities including singer Cher, actor Will Ferrell and Tesla Chief Elon Musk deleting their accounts, Facebook\u2019s social app downloads improved on a monthly basis both in the United States and globally, according to Evercore ISI.  Facebook expanded its share of social app downloads in March by 33.2 percent from 30.1 percent, Evercore data showed.

Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, told Bloomberg in an interview on Thursday that a few advertisers had paused spending in the wake of the incident, but that the company was having reassuring conversations about how it has built privacy into its system. (bloom.bg\/2q89KMt)  Companies including U.S. auto parts retailer Pep Boys, internet company Mozilla and German bank Commerzbank AG have suspended advertisement on the platform.  Sandberg also said a tool that allowed a researcher to gain access to personal information of up to 87 million users, complied with a privacy agreement the company signed with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2011.  Her comments followed reports that the FTC was investigating the company over a possible violation of that agreement, which demands it to get user consent before sharing their information.  \u201cWhile it\u2019s clear that investor sentiment has been materially impacted by (the) Cambridge Analytica revelations, we believe FB is acting proactively and aggressively to tighten its privacy controls and increase the level of transparency into its practices,\u201d Wells Fargo analyst Ken Sena said.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam\/File Photo  (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday rejected Facebook Inc\u2019s effort to undo a class action lawsuit claiming that it illegally collected and stored biometric data for millions of users without their consent.  The 3-0 decision from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco over Facebook\u2019s facial recognition technology exposes the company to billions of dollars in potential damages to the Illinois users who brought the case.  It came as the social media company faces broad criticism from lawmakers and regulators over its privacy practices. Last month, Facebook agreed to pay a record $5 billion fine to settle a Federal Trade Commission data privacy probe.  \u201cThis biometric data is so sensitive that if it is compromised, there is simply no recourse,\u201d Shawn Williams, a lawyer for plaintiffs in the class action, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a Social Security card or credit card number where you can change the number. You can\u2019t change your face.\u201d  Facebook said it plans to appeal. \u201cWe have always disclosed our use of face recognition technology and that people can turn it on or off at any time,\u201d a spokesman said in an email.  Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, won the dismissal of a similar lawsuit in Chicago last December.  The lawsuit began in 2015, when Illinois users accused Facebook of violating that state\u2019s Biometric Information Privacy Act in collecting biometric data.  Facebook allegedly accomplished this through its \u201cTag Suggestions\u201d feature, which allowed users to recognize their Facebook friends from previously uploaded photos.  Writing for the appeals court, Circuit Judge Sandra Ikuta said the Illinois users could sue as a group, rejecting Facebook\u2019s argument that their claims were unique and required individual lawsuits.  She also said the 2008 Illinois law was intended to protect individuals\u2019 \u201cconcrete interests in privacy,\u201d and Facebook\u2019s alleged unauthorized use of a face template \u201cinvades an individual\u2019s private affairs and concrete interests.\u201d  The court returned the case to U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco, who had certified a class action in April 2018, for a possible trial.  Illinois\u2019 biometric privacy law provides for damages of $1,000 for each negligent violation and $5,000 for each intentional or reckless violation.  Williams, a partner at Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, said the class could include 7 million Facebook users.  The FTC probe arose from the discovery that Facebook had let British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica harvest users\u2019 personal information.

In a later series of tweets, Warren noted that Facebook has built more market dominance in recent years by acquiring potential competitors WhatsApp and Instagram.  \u201cMore than 85% of all social networking traffic goes through sites owned or operated by Facebook,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of power\u2014and face little competition or accountability.  \u201cThey\u2019ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, undermined our democracy, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.\u201d  In the audio, Zuckerberg said breaking up big tech companies would make election interference \u201cmore likely because now the companies can\u2019t coordinate and work together.\u201d  Zuckerberg also drew laughter by saying Facebook\u2019s investment on safety is bigger than Twitter\u2019s entire revenue.

Facebook has linked with 28 partners in a Geneva-based entity called the Libra Association, which will govern its new digital coin set to launch in the first half of 2020, according to marketing materials and interviews with executives.  Facebook has also created a subsidiary called Calibra, which will offer digital wallets to save, send and spend Libras. Calibra will be connected to Facebook\u2019s messaging platforms Messenger and WhatsApp, which already boast more than a billion users.  The Menlo Park, California-based company has big aspirations for Libra, but consumer privacy concerns or regulatory barriers may present significant hurdles.  Facebook hopes it will not only power transactions between established consumers and businesses around the globe, but offer unbanked consumers access to financial services for the first time.  The name \u201cLibra\u201d was inspired by Roman weight measurements, the astrological sign for justice and the French word for freedom, said David Marcus, a former PayPal executive who heads the project for Facebook.  \u201cFreedom, justice and money, which is exactly what we\u2019re trying to do here,\u201d he said.  Facebook also appears to be betting it can squeeze revenue out of its messaging services through transactions and payments, something that is already happening on Chinese social apps like WeChat.  The Libra announcement comes as Facebook is grappling with public backlash due to a series of scandals, and may face opposition from privacy advocates, consumer groups, regulators and lawmakers.  Some Facebook adversaries have called for the company to incur penalties, or be forcibly broken up, for mishandling user data, allowing troubling material to appear on its site and not preventing Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election through a social media disinformation campaign.  It is not clear how lawmakers or regulators will react to Facebook making a push into financial services through the largely unregulated world of cryptocurrency.  In recent years, cryptocurrency investors have lost hundreds of millions of dollars through hacks, and the market has been plagued by accusations of money-laundering, illegal drug sales and terrorist financing.  Facebook has engaged with regulators in the United States and abroad about the planned cryptocurrency, company executives said. They would not specify which regulators or whether the company has applied for financial licenses anywhere.  Facebook hopes it can bring global regulators to the table by publicizing Libra, said Kevin Weil, who runs product for the initiative.  \u201cIt gives us a basis to go and have productive conversations with regulators around the world,\u201d said Weil. \u201cWe\u2019re eager to do that.\u201d  MAJOR PARTNERS  Bitcoin, the most well-known cryptocurrency, was created in 2008 as a way for pseudonymous users to transfer value online through encrypted digital ledgers. Early developers believed that the world needed an alternative to traditional currencies, which are controlled by governments and by central banks.  Since then, thousands of bitcoin alternatives have launched, and Facebook is just one of dozens of blue-chip companies dabbling with the underlying technology. But its status as a Silicon Valley behemoth that touches billions of people around the world has created significant buzz around Libra\u2019s potential.  Partners in the project include household names like Mastercard Inc, Visa Inc, Spotify Technology SA , PayPal Holdings Inc, eBay Inc, Uber Technologies Inc and Vodafone Group Plc, as well as venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz.  They hope to have 100 members by Libra\u2019s launch during the first half of 2020. Each member gets one vote on substantial decisions regarding the cryptocurrency network and firms must invest at least $10 million to join. Facebook does not plan to maintain a leadership role after 2019.  Though there are no banks among the inaugural members, there have been discussions with a number of lenders about joining, said Jorn Lambert, executive vice president for digital solutions at Mastercard.

The Libra Association plans to raise money through a private placement in the coming months, according to a statement from the association.  PRIVACY, REGULATORY CONCERNS  Although Libra-backers who spoke to Reuters or provided materials are hopeful about its prospects, some expressed awareness that consumer privacy concerns or regulatory barriers may prevent the project from succeeding.  Calibra will conduct compliance checks on customers who want to use Libra, using verification and anti-fraud processes that are common among banks, Facebook said.  The subsidiary will only share customer data with Facebook or external parties if it has consent, or in \u201climited cases\u201d where it is necessary, Facebook said. That could include for law enforcement, public safety or general system functionality.  Transactions will cost individuals less than merchants, Facebook said, though executives declined to provide specifics. Each Libra will be backed by a basket of government-backed assets.  The company plans to refund customers who lose money because of fraud, Facebook said.  Sri Shivananda, Paypal\u2019s chief technology officer said in an interview that the project is still in its \u201cvery, very early days,\u201d and there were conversations in progress with regulators.  Mastercard\u2019s Lambert characterized Libra similarly, noting much needed to happen before the launch.

REUTERS\/Johanna Geron\/Illustration\/File Photo  \u201cThis is part of our ongoing efforts to reduce the potential for confusion or abuse,\u201d Facebook told advertisers in an email seen by Reuters.  Last month, Facebook lifted its temporary ban for U.S. political ads in Georgia, as the state prepared for runoff elections that would determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. The election was on Tuesday.  Both Facebook and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google had paused political ads after the Nov. 3 presidential election as part of measures to battle misinformation and other abuses.  Democrats and election experts criticized the bans, saying they were overly blunt and blocked legitimate voter registration efforts in Georgia. Re-enabling the ads in mid-December brought other headaches, opening the social media platform to accusations that it was inadequately enforcing its own policies.  Shortly after Facebook lifted the ban, American Crossroads, a top Republican super PAC, began running ads claiming that Democratic candidate Raphael Warnock had said, \u201cGod damn America.\u201d Facebook\u2019s fact-checking partners found Warnock had quoted the phrase and was not using it to express his own sentiment.  Facebook removed the ads, but failed to catch American Crossroads re-posting the same ads on multiple occasions over the following weeks, taking them down only after reporting by newsletter Popular Information.  In total, Facebook has removed 80% of the group\u2019s 63 ads since December, according to a Reuters tally conducted using the company\u2019s Ad Library.  Jack Pandol, communications director for American Crossroads, said on Tuesday that most of the ads Facebook pulled down were effectively the same, containing different versions of the \u201cGod damn America\u201d claim.  \u201cFacebook disagreed with us about two of the messages we ran on that platform, and we now have ads up that are every bit as tough as the ones they disagreed with,\u201d he said.  The repostings prompted Facebook\u2019s advertising integrity chief, Rob Leathern, to ask in an internal company post - initially reported by Popular Information and independently confirmed by Reuters - whether Facebook should penalize American Crossroads \u201cfor attempting to circumvent our ads policies by repeatedly posting the same content.\u201d  As of Tuesday, American Crossroads ads, including ones containing other claims debunked by fact-checkers about Warnock, remained on Facebook.  Facebook declined to comment on whether it had applied any penalties to the American Crossroads account. Leathern left the company last week.","547":"May 9 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc co-founder and former Mark Zuckerberg roommate Chris Hughes has called for the break up of the social network in an opinion piece in the New York Times.  \"We are a nation with a tradition of reining in monopolies, no matter how well intentioned the leaders of these companies may be. Mark's power is unprecedented and un-American,\" Hughes wrote here on Thursday.  Facebook owns the largest social network with more than 2 billion users across the world. It also owns WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, each used by more than 1 billion people.  Hughes co-founded Facebook in 2004 at Harvard with the company's Chief Executive Officer Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. He quit Facebook in 2007 and later said in a LinkedIn post here that he made half a billion dollars for his three years of work.  \u201cIt\u2019s been 15 years since I co-founded Facebook at Harvard, and I haven\u2019t worked at the company in a decade. But I feel a sense of anger and responsibility,\u201d said Hughes, who later was an online strategist for Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential campaign.  The company did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  In one of a number of security and privacy scandals to hit the company, Facebook is accused of inappropriately sharing information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.  Hughes said he last met with Zuckerberg in the summer of 2017, several months before the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke.  \u201cMark is a good, kind person. But I\u2019m angry that his focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks,\u201d Hughes said.  \u201cAnd I\u2019m worried that Mark has surrounded himself with a team that reinforces his beliefs instead of challenging them.\u201d  Hughes is not alone in asking for break-up of Facebook. Some lawmakers have called for federal privacy regulation and anti-trust action to break up big tech companies.  Democratic presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren in March vowed here to break up Facebook, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google if elected U.S. president to promote competition in the tech sector.

Ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November 2020, the world\u2019s biggest social network has vowed to curb political manipulation of its platform.  Facebook failed to counter Russian interference in the 2016 election and allowed misuse of user data by defunct political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. Now, it faces intense criticism of its relatively hands-off ads policies, especially after exempting politicians\u2019 ads from fact-checking standards applied to other content.  Facebook said it and its photo-sharing app Instagram will soon have a tool enabling individual users to choose to see fewer political and social issue ads, and will make more ad audience data publicly available.  In contrast, Twitter Inc TWTR.N banned political ads in October, while Alphabet Inc's Google GOOGL.O said it would stop letting advertisers target election ads using data such as public voter records and general political affiliations. Online platforms Spotify SPOT.N, Pinterest PINS.N and TikTok have also issued bans.  A spokesman for the re-election campaign of President Donald Trump, which has spent more on Facebook ads than any other candidate, said the company\u2019s approach to political messages is better than those from Twitter and Google as it \u201cencourages more Americans to be involved in the process.\u201d  U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, condemned the company on Twitter for \u201cstanding their ground on letting political figures lie to you.\u201d She has called for Facebook\u2019s breakup on antitrust grounds.  In a blog post, Facebook\u2019s director of product management Rob Leathern said the company considered imposing limits like Google\u2019s, but decided against them as internal data indicated most ads run by U.S. presidential candidates are broadly targeted, at audiences larger than 250,000 people.  Leathern wrote Facebook\u2019s polices are based \u201con the principle that people should be able to hear from those who wish to lead them, warts and all.\u201d  Facebook will roll out the expanded audience data features in the first quarter and plans to deploy the political ads control starting in the United States this summer, eventually expanding this setting to more locations.  CUSTOM AUDIENCES  Vivian Schiller, a news executive who has joined former tech employees and investors advocating for changes around the companies\u2019 handling of political advertising, took issue with Leathern\u2019s stance.  \u201cAllowing the targeting of political messages to narrow slivers of the electorate is the opposite of enabling public debate,\u201d said Schiller, who briefly headed the news unit at Twitter in 2014. \u201cIt\u2019s akin to shadowboxing.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: Stickers bearing the Facebook logo are pictured at Facebook Inc's F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S., April 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  She said that once Facebook users share advertisements on their own feeds, the \u201cpaid post\u201d labeling vanishes along with disclosures of who funded the messages.  Another change Facebook is introducing will be to allow users to choose to stop seeing ads based on an advertiser\u2019s \u201cCustom Audience\u201d and that will apply to all types of advertising, not only political ads.  The \u201cCustom Audiences\u201d feature lets advertisers upload lists of personal data they maintain, like email addresses and phone numbers. Facebook then matches that information to user accounts and shows the advertiser\u2019s content to those people.  However, Facebook will not give users a blanket option to turn off the feature, meaning they must opt out of ads for each advertiser one by one, a spokesman told Reuters.  The change will also not affect ad targeting via Facebook\u2019s Lookalike Audiences tool, which uses the same uploads of personal data to direct ads at people with similar characteristics to those on the lists, the spokesman said.  Leathern said in the post the company would make new information publicly available about the audience size of political ads in its Ad Library, showing approximately how many people the advertisers aimed to reach.  The changes followed a New York Times report this week of an internal memo by senior Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth, who told employees the company had a duty not to tilt the scales against U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.  Bosworth, a close confidant of Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, subsequently made his post public. He wrote that he believed Facebook was responsible for Trump\u2019s election in 2016, but not because of misinformation or Trump\u2019s work with Cambridge Analytica.  Rather, he said, the Trump campaign used Facebook\u2019s advertising tools most effectively.","551":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Facebook Inc and its chief executive Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday won dismissal of an investor lawsuit accusing them of deceiving investors about the likely impact of a privacy breach on its stock price, though the investors will be have a chance to refile their case.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam\/File Photo  U.S. District Judge Edward Davila in San Jose, California said the investors had failed to allege that Facebook or its executives knowingly made false statements that led to investor losses.  Facebook and lawyers for the investors could not immediately be reached for comment.  The class action lawsuit, which was consolidated from several investor complaints filed since last year, also targeted Facebook chief organization officer Sheryl Sandberg and chief financial officer David Wehner.  The investors focus on a privacy breach, first reported in December 2015, that allowed Cambridge Analytica, a British political consulting firm, to access data for an estimated 87 million Facebook users.  In March 2018, multiple media outlets reported that Facebook was still allowing third parties to access user data, and that data from the Cambridge Analytica breach had been used in connection with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. The reports caused the company\u2019s stock price to drop more than 18 percent in two weeks.  In July 2018, Facebook\u2019s stock price dropped sharply again, by nearly 19 percent, immediately after the company revealed in its quarterly earnings report that growth in the number of active users was slowing and total revenues was declining.  The investors claimed in their lawsuit that Facebook and its executives made dozens of statements downplaying the effect that the Cambridge Analytica leak and related user privacy issues would have on its stock price.  Davila, however, said Thursday that they had failed to identify specific instances of the company or its executives knowingly making false statements. He noted that some were forward-looking predictions and others were general expressions of optimism, which generally cannot be the basis for securities fraud lawsuits.  The judge gave the investors until Oct. 26 to file a new version of their complaint, saying it was \u201cpossible plaintiffs can cure their allegations by alleging, among other things, more particular facts as to why statements by the individual defendants were false when made.\u201d  Facebook is separately facing a nationwide lawsuit from users seeking to hold the company liable under various state and federal laws for allowing third parties, including Cambrdige Analytica, to access their data.","552":"Feb 17 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc said in a blog post on Wednesday that it would restrict publishers and users in Australia from sharing or viewing Australian and international news content.

The ban, one of Facebook's measures to combat misinformation and other abuses on its site, was supposed to last about a week but could be extended. Alphabet Inc's Google GOOGL.O also appeared to be sticking with its post-election political ad ban.  \u201cWhile multiple sources have projected a presidential winner, we still believe it\u2019s important to help prevent confusion or abuse on our platform,\u201d Facebook told advertisers in an email seen by Reuters. It said to expect the pause to last another month though there \u201cmay be an opportunity to resume these ads sooner.\u201d  Facebook later confirmed the extension in a blog post.  Baseless claims about the election reverberated around social media this week as President Donald Trump challenged the validity of the outcome, even as state officials reported no significant irregularities and legal experts cautioned he had little chance to overturn Democratic President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory.  In one Facebook group created on Sunday, which rapidly grew to nearly 400,000 members by Wednesday, members calling for a nationwide recount swapped unfounded accusations about alleged election fraud and state vote counts every few seconds.  \u201cThe reality is right now that we are not through the danger zone,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.  Google declined to answer questions about the length of its ad pause, although one advertiser said the company had floated the possibility of extending it through or after December. A Google spokeswoman previously said the company would lift its ban based on factors such as the time needed for votes to be counted and whether there was civil unrest.  The extensions mean the top two digital advertising behemoths, which together control more than half the market, are not accepting election ads ahead of two hotly contested U.S. Senate runoff races in Georgia, including ads aimed at increasing voter turnout.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  Democratic and Republican digital strategists railed against those decisions, saying the bans were overly broad and failed to combat a much bigger problem on the platforms: the organic spread of viral lies in unpaid posts.  The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, along with the Senate campaigns of Georgia Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, called for an exemption for the Georgia races so they could make voters aware of upcoming deadlines.  \u201cIt is driving us absolutely bonkers,\u201d said Mark Jablonowski, managing partner of DSPolitical, a digital firm that works with Democratic causes.  Eric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist, said he thought the companies\u2019 concerns about ads on the election outcome did not require a blanket ban. \u201cThis is something that deserves a scalpel and they\u2019re using a rusty ax,\u201d he said.  Facebook Director of Product Management Rob Leathern acknowledged the frustration in a series of tweets, but said the world\u2019s biggest social network lacked \u201cthe technical ability in the short term to enable political ads by state or by advertiser.\u201d  VIRAL LIES  The companies declined to say when they would lift other \u201cbreak-glass\u201d election measures introduced for unpaid posts, like Facebook\u2019s demotions of content that its systems predict may be misinformation.  Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said those emergency measures would not be permanent, but that rollback was \u201cnot imminent.\u201d  Google\u2019s YouTube, which is labeling all election-related videos with information about the outcome, said it would stick with that approach \u201cas long as it\u2019s necessary.\u201d  The video-sharing company bans \u201cdemonstrably false\u201d claims about the election process, but has used the tool sparingly, saying hyperbolic statements about a political party \u201cstealing\u201d the election does not violate the policy.  However, Twitter Inc TWTR.N has stopped using its most restrictive election-related warning labels, which hid and limited engagement on violating tweets. Instead, the company is now using lighter-touch labels that \"provide additional context,\" spokeswoman Katie Rosborough said.  Twitter placed a label reading \u201cthis claim about election fraud is disputed\u201d on two of Trump\u2019s tweets Tuesday morning, but each was retweeted more than 80,000 times by that evening.  Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation fellow at the Wilson Center, said the ad pauses were needed but not sufficient for curbing the spread of viral lies.  \u201cClearly President Trump does not think the election is over, so I don\u2019t think the platforms should treat it as if it is,\u201d she said.","554":"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Facebook\u2019s lead regulator in the European Union, Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commissioner, on Thursday said it had launched an inquiry into whether the company violated EU data rules by saving user passwords in plain text format on internal servers.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Facebook is pictured during the Viva Tech start-up and technology summit in Paris, France, May 25, 2018. REUTERS\/Charles Platiau  The probe is the latest to be launched out of Dublin into the social network giant. The Irish regulator in February said it had seven statutory inquiries into Facebook and three more into Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp.  Facebook in March announced that it has resolved a glitch that exposed passwords of millions of users stored in readable format within its internal systems to its employees.  The passwords were accessible to as many as 20,000 Facebook employees and dated back as early as 2012, cyber security blog KrebsOnSecurity, which first reported the issue, said in its report.  \u201cThe Data Protection Commission (DPC) was notified by Facebook that it had discovered that hundreds of millions of user passwords, relating to users of Facebook, Facebook Lite and Instagram, were stored by Facebook in plain text format in its internal servers,\u201d the DPC said in a statement.  \u201cWe have this week commenced a statutory inquiry in relation to this issue to determine whether Facebook has complied with its obligations under relevant provisions of the GDPR,\u201d it added.

Facebook is also under scrutiny over its handling of user data to target online advertising - a business that it, together with Google, has come to dominate globally.

The reasons given were to help to improve services, fight spam and improve user experiences - including making product suggestions and showing relevant offers and advertisements.  At the time, data protection officials expressed concern that users of WhatsApp were not being fully informed about how their data was being used nor their consent sought.  Similar investigations are under way in Germany where the country\u2019s main anti-trust office, the Federal Cartel Office, has found that Facebook abused its dominant position in its handling of user data - including from its online properties WhatsApp and Instagram.  France\u2019s data privacy watchdog said in December that it might fine WhatsApp if it does not comply with an order to bring its sharing of user data with Facebook into line with French privacy law.  Denham said that she had been assured by WhatsApp that no data had been shared with Facebook other than as a data processor - in line with a pledge that was given after the UK probe was opened.  \u201cWhatsApp cares deeply about the privacy of our users.

The two tech giants together commanded nearly 60% of the U.S. internet advertising market in 2018, according to the report, up 3% from the previous year. Google\u2019s YouTube dominates online video, while Facebook has been expanding its video product called Watch and adding advertising options.

U.S. wireless carrier AT&T Inc despite spending $85 billion for media company Time Warner to transform into a media and advertising firm, has only managed to eke out single digit market share, according to PwC.  Gaining market share is difficult because platforms must have features that are new and specific as well as some degree of emerging technology, said C.J. Bangah, a principal at PwC. An advantage the telecommunications companies like AT&T have over Google and Facebook is they will benefit from 5G, the next generation wireless network that is expected to bring technology like autonomous cars to reality.  \u201cThe opportunity created for telecom providers is they know where consumers are, they\u2019re benefiting from 5G and they know what apps consumers spend time on,\u201d she said.  Amazon, the largest U.S. online retailer, has been able to gain the most ground over the past year, though it too only has single-digit market share, PwC said.  Amazon\u2019s product ads are fueling their growth, Bangah said, because advertisers are able to reach consumers on a website where people are in the mindset to shop.","557":"A Kansas judge on Friday ruled that a court reporter who had shared on social media her opinions about a murder trial that she had worked on broke the state\u2019s rules on judicial impartiality and should be subject to public discipline.

But that was inadequate, said Blumenthal and Hawley, who said the FTC should go further.  \u201cIt should consider setting rules of the road on what Facebook can do with consumers\u2019 private information, such as requiring the deletion of tracking data, restricting the collection of certain types of information, curbing advertising practices, and imposing a firewall on sharing private data between different products,\u201d they said in a letter to FTC Chairman Joe Simons.  The FTC has been investigating revelations that Facebook inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The probe has focused on whether the sharing of data and other disputes violated a 2011 agreement with the FTC to safeguard user privacy.

REUTERS\/Rachel Wisniewski  But the social media company, which has been under pressure to police harmful content and misinformation related to the pandemic, said it would only take down anti-quarantine protest events if they defied government guidelines.  Stay-at-home orders, which experts say are essential to slow the spread of the virus but which have battered the U.S. economy, have been enacted at the state level.  Facebook said it would align with those directives, and also remove events that defy social distancing guidelines.

While the majority of Americans agree with the restrictions, according to a Pew Research Center survey in April where 66% of respondents said they were more concerned that restrictions would be lifted too quickly rather than not quickly enough, protests have flared up across several states.

Some large Facebook groups where anti-quarantine activists have organized have been allowed to operate and have gained traction on the site.

Zuckerberg is likely to be peppered with critical questions from lawmakers skeptical of Facebook\u2019s efforts to help launch a global cryptocurrency called Libra. Also, the federal government charged Facebook in March with violating fair lending laws, saying the company sold targeted advertising that was racially discriminatory.  Rep. Maxine Waters, the Democrat who chairs the panel, has been fiercely critical of Facebook, calling on it to halt its Libra project, which the company has said would launch in the middle of 2020.  Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony will come at a precarious time for Libra. U.S. payments processor PayPal Holdings Inc said this month it was leaving the Libra Association, a group of private companies helping develop the currency.

FILE PHOTO: A picture illustration shows a Facebook logo reflected in a person's eye, in Zenica, March 13, 2015. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  Social media companies, especially Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc, have been under heavy pressure to find ways of stopping what is often referred to as \u201cinformation warfare\u201d on their services.  The indictment of 13 Russian nationals on Friday, announced by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, made extensive use of records from Facebook and Instagram, according to people familiar with the matter.  Yet the combination of tactics revealed in the indictment, including the use of shell corporations and stolen IDs, deployment of virtual private networks to avoid online detection, and payments to unwitting Americans, suggests even a company as powerful as Facebook could struggle to stop such activities by itself as they happen.  U.S. spy agencies have said Russia would try to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections, again by using social media to spread propaganda.  \u201cThey can\u2019t out of hand stop it, because it\u2019s very difficult for them to trace those things,\u201d said Ann Ravel, a former member of the U.S. Federal Election Commission. The clandestine purchase of advertising on the site through fake personas was particularly alarming, she said.  To know the identities of ad buyers, internet companies might need to duplicate the \u201cknow your customer\u201d practices of banks and regularly share information with authorities, Ravel said.  Facebook has said it will start requiring thorough documentation from election-related advertisers to verify their identity and location, beginning with U.S. elections this year.  How extensive that vetting will be is unclear. \u201cIf you want to put up a theme page for a group, in the ordinary course you wouldn\u2019t expect that a vendor like Facebook would require that sort of vetting,\u201d said Dan Petalas, a former U.S. federal prosecutor.  \u201cThe indictment really details an elaborate scheme that would be difficult to identify,\u201d he said.  Facebook said on Friday it was making \u201csignificant investments\u201d to guard against future attacks and was working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to deter election interference.  The Russians\u2019 alleged campaign began with three weeks of reconnaissance in 2014, when two of them traveled to nine U.S. states, including Colorado and Michigan, according to the indictment. They were equipped with cameras, SIM cards, drop phones and, if needed, \u201cevacuation scenarios,\u201d the indictment says.  It describes the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg as an organized bureaucracy. It was backed by an annual budget of millions of dollars, employed hundreds of people and boasted several departments dedicated to specific projects, like search-engine optimization and graphics.  Even those who have demanded Facebook do more acknowledged on Friday it could do only so much.  \u201cWe each bear some responsibility for exercising good judgment and a healthy amount of skepticism when it comes to the things we read and share on social media,\u201d Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement.  The defendants are accused of stealing social security numbers of Americans to open up fraudulent accounts on digital payment system PayPal Holdings Inc. They purchased space on computer servers located within the United States to use virtual private networks to mask their identities and pose as Americans.

Facebook FB.O has said the personal information of about 87 million users might have been improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election campaign.  Facebook Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer said the mistakes made by the firm hurt, and that it was cooperating with investigations by British regulators.  But he sometimes looked uncomfortable as he was unable or unwilling to answer all of the lawmakers\u2019 questions, and the committee\u2019s chairman reiterated a demand for Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to answer questions from lawmakers.  \u201cMr Schroepfer, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s right-hand man whom we were assured could represent his views, today failed to answer many specific and detailed questions about Facebook\u2019s business practices,\u201d said Damian Collins, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, in a statement after the hearing.  Collins said Schroepfer had failed to provide full answers on nearly 40 points.  In a written submission prior to the hearing, Schroepfer said those wanting to run political adverts would have to complete an authorization process and the messages would also have to display who paid for them.  \u201cI want to start by echoing our CEO, Mark Zuckerberg: what happened with Cambridge Analytica represents a breach of trust, and we are deeply sorry. We made mistakes and we are taking steps to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d Schroepfer wrote.  Earlier this month, Zuckerberg apologized to U.S. senators for issues that have beset Facebook, but the 33-year-old internet mogul managed to deflect calls for any specific promises to support possible congressional regulation.  Schroepfer was filling in for Zuckerberg in front of the British lawmakers after the Facebook chief declined to appear himself, a decision the parliamentary committee chairman had described as astonishing.  Schroepfer said users would be able to view who runs adverts by June and that further measures, including labels for political ads and a searchable archive, would be rolled out before local elections in May 2019.  He denied that any shortcomings in Facebook\u2019s approach to political adverts before now had been due to commercial reasons.  \u201cThis is not an issue of revenue for us,\u201d he said. \u201cPolitical advertising is a very small, low single-digit percentage of our overall advertising, so the decisions here have nothing to do with money or revenue.\u201d  WE ARE HUMAN  During an often testy hearing, Facebook was criticized for how it has worked with the committee, as lawmakers gather evidence for an inquiry into \u201cfake news\u201d.  Schroepfer declined to give much detail, citing ongoing investigations by Britain\u2019s information commissioner and Electoral Commission, despite repeated reassurances by committee chair Collins that it was legally safe for him to do so.  \u201cWhat\u2019s been a frustration for us in this inquiry is a pattern of behavior from the company, an unwillingness to engage, and a desire to hold on to information and not disclose it,\u201d Collins told Schroepfer.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Asked by another lawmaker whether Facebook would apologize for its \u201cbullying\u201d behavior towards the media since the scandal broke, Schroepfer said: \u201cI am sorry that journalists feel that we are trying to prevent them from getting the truth out.  \u201cThat is not the intent, so I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he added.  Lawmakers also raised concerns over the use of social media in Britain\u2019s referendum vote in 2016 to leave the European Union.  Schroepfer said it was clear Facebook had not done enough to ensure its tools were \u201cpotentially being used for harm\u201d or take a broad enough view of its responsibility.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  As many as a million British Facebook users may have had their data harvested because they were connected to U.S. users targeted in data passed to Cambridge Analytica, Schroepfer said.  But there was no evidence of Cambridge Analytica managing referendum-related ads or pages, Schroepfer said, or spending money on the campaigns.  Cambridge Analytica said, in a tweet, that this was \u201chardly surprising: Cambridge Analytica didn\u2019t work on the referendum.\u201d  Cambridge Analytica has said it pitched to the Leave.EU campaign group for work, but that no work was undertaken.  However, Schroepfer said a Canadian firm called AggregateIQ, which performed work for the official campaign group Vote Leave, spent $2 million on ads.  He added that \u201csimilar people\u201d appeared in the accounts and billing information of AIQ and Cambridge Analytica.  Cambridge Analytica has said it was not involved in AIQ\u2019s work for Vote Leave, while AIQ has said it never entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica and has never been part of the firm.  Facebook received a certification that Cambridge Analytica deleted the data at the center of the scandal when requested, Schroepfer said.  But one lawmaker said details of what Facebook knew about Cambridge Analytica had been withheld when the committee took evidence in Washington from more junior Facebook officials.  Schroepfer said Facebook was doing its best to provide information as and when it had it, and said the organization had integrity.  \u201cIt hurts when we make mistakes. It hurts when people abuse our platform,\u201d Schroepfer said. \u201cWe are human and make mistakes.\u201d","574":"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany wants to rescue talks with the United States on how to tax big digital firms such as Google GOOG.O, Amazon AMZN.O and Facebook FB.O, the finance ministry said on Thursday after Washington pulled out of the negotiations.  \u201cWe continue to work hard for a solution that adequately addresses the tax challenges of digitalisation and leads to fair taxation,\u201d the finance ministry said in a statement.  \u201cAs in every negotiation process, there are points to be clarified together.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  The group of high-growth stocks that supercharged the S&P 500's decade-long rally in recent years has had mixed results in 2019, with Facebook and Amazon dramatically outperforming the broader market, while Netflix NFLX.O and Google-owner Alphabet have lagged.  Facebook reports on Wednesday after the bell, with Amazon and Alphabet on Thursday, all together accounting for 9% of the S&P 500\u2019s stock market value. Overall, companies reporting this week account for about 30% of the S&P 500\u2019s value.  Investors\u2019 reactions to those reports could affect broader market sentiment as the S&P 500 trades about 1% below its July 12 record high close, with investors widely expecting the Fed to cut interest rates later this month. The benchmark index was up 0.3% on Monday.  \u201cI\u2019m more concerned about how the reports from the likes of Alphabet and Facebook will affect my other tech stocks, because they suck the oxygen out of the room every time something happens to them,\u201d said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which owns shares of Amazon and Alphabet.  Also reporting this week are chipmakers Intel INTC.O, Texas Instruments TXN.O and Xilinx XLNX.O, which will likely give investors fresh information about the impact of the U.S.-China trade war, the pace of 5G growth, and when a downturn in global semiconductor demand may end.  Netflix has tumbled 14% since Wednesday, when it reported weaker-than-expected subscriber growth. Facing an approaching wave of competition, the video streaming service is up 18% year to date, just below the S&P 500\u2019s 19% gain. Alphabet is up just 8% in 2019, while Amazon has surged 31%.  When Facebook reports, investors will focus on how the leading social network is responding to regulatory scrutiny of its handling of users\u2019 personal data, and how planned measures including a \u201cClear History\u201d option may hurt advertising revenue.  Reflecting improved expectations, Facebook has surged 51% in 2019 and is 7% short of the record high it set a year ago, just before it warned of a multi-year squeeze on its business margins, sending its stock into months of decline.  Facebook\u2019s June-quarter revenue is seen jumping 25% to $16.5 billion, with net income up 5% to $5.4 billion, equivalent to $1.87 per share, according to Refinitiv.  Analysts expect Alphabet\u2019s quarterly revenue to climb 17% to $38.2 billion, with net income falling 4% to $7.9 billion. Analysts expect Amazon\u2019s quarterly revenue to grow by 18% to $62.5 billion, with net income growing 11% to $2.82 billion.","576":"FILE PHOTO: A woman looks at the Facebook logo on an iPad in this photo illustration taken June 3, 2018.

Facebook said on Friday that hackers had stolen login codes that allowed them to access nearly 50 million Facebook accounts, its worst-ever security breach given the unprecedented level of potential access.  \u201cIn particular, the investigation will examine Facebook\u2019s compliance with its obligation under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security and safeguarding of the personal data it processes,\u201d the DPC said in a statement.  Under the new GDPR European privacy regulations which came into effect in May, breaking privacy laws can result in fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue or 20 million euros, whichever is higher, as opposed to a few hundred thousand euros previously.  The DPC, which regulates a number of U.S. multinationals with European headquarters in Dublin, said Facebook informed it that their own internal investigation is continuing and that the company continued to take remedial actions to mitigate the potential risk to users.  Facebook said on Tuesday that investigators had determined that the hackers did not access other sites that use the social networking site\u2019s single sign-on.  Some security experts, including a former Facebook executive, said the company may have painted a worst-case scenario when it disclosed the attack on Friday to ensure compliance with the strict new European Union privacy rules.  GDPR imposes steep penalties if companies fail to follow rules that include a requirement that they disclose breaches within 72 hours of discovery. That is a tight window that security experts say does not give investigators adequate time to determine the impact of the breach.  Facebook\u2019s latest vulnerability had existed since July 2017, but the company first identified it on Tuesday of last week.","577":"WASHINGTON\/BERLIN (Reuters) - Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies strongly supported the need to regulate digital currencies, the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement on Monday after a virtual meeting of the officials.

Trillium Asset Management, which owns about 73,000 shares of Facebook Inc FB.O, said existing risk oversight structures at Facebook appeared to lack a \"dedicated focus.\"  Facebook has faced public outcry and intense political scrutiny since it was disclosed that the personal information of several millions of users was harvested by the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.  Menlo Park, California-based Facebook has also been criticized for its role in Russia\u2019s alleged influence over the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  \"The sheer volume, magnitude, and frequency of Facebook's controversies strongly suggests that the company's whack-a-mole approach is insufficient - Facebook needs to institutionalize stronger risk oversight mechanisms,\" Trillium said in a letter here to fellow Facebook shareholders.  Trillium\u2019s proposal first came in a regulatory filing on Friday.  Facebook, at the time, appeared to oppose the proposal, saying it would be inefficient to form a separate oversight committee, given that many of its board members were already overseeing risk-related matters.  \u201cWe believe that our board and committees have sufficient time and resources to address risk oversight matters along with their other responsibilities,\u201d Facebook had said.  A Facebook spokeswoman maintained that response on Tuesday.  The social networking giant\u2019s lack of attention to risk management has eroded shareholder value, Trillium said, pointing to Facebook\u2019s warning last week that new investments in security will \u201csignificantly\u201d impact future profits.  Facebook has lost nearly $47 billion in market value since the Cambridge Analytica revelations first surfaced last month.","579":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc faced new calls for regulation from within U.S. Congress and was hit with questions about personal data safeguards on Saturday after reports a political consultant gained inappropriate access to 50 million users\u2019 data starting in 2014.  FILE PHOTO: Facebook logo is seen at a start-up companies gathering at Paris' Station F in Paris, France on January 17, 2017. REUTERS\/Philippe Wojazer\/File Photo  Facebook disclosed the issue in a blog post on Friday, hours before media reports that conservative-leaning Cambridge Analytica, a data company known for its work on Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, was given access to the data and may not have deleted it.  The scrutiny presented a new threat to Facebook\u2019s reputation, which was already under attack over Russians\u2019 alleged use of Facebook tools to sway American voters before and after the 2016 U.S. elections.  \u201cIt\u2019s clear these platforms can\u2019t police themselves,\u201d Democratic U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar tweeted.  \u201cThey say \u2018trust us.\u2019 Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary,\u201d she added, referring to Facebook\u2019s CEO and a committee she sits on.  Facebook said the root of the problem was that researchers and Cambridge Analytica lied to it and abused its policies, but critics on Saturday threw blame at Facebook as well, demanding answers on behalf of users and calling for new regulation.  Facebook insisted the data was misused but not stolen, because users gave permission, sparking a debate about what constitutes a hack that must be disclosed to customers.  \u201cThe lid is being opened on the black box of Facebook\u2019s data practices, and the picture is not pretty,\u201d said Frank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor who has written about Silicon Valley\u2019s use of data.  Pasquale said Facebook\u2019s response that data had not technically been stolen seemed to obfuscate the central issue that data was apparently used in a way contrary to the expectations of users.  \u201cIt amazes me that they are trying to make this about nomenclature. I guess that\u2019s all they have left,\u201d he said.  Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Warner said the episode bolstered the need for new regulations about internet advertising, describing the industry as the \u201cWild West.\u201d  \u201cWhether it\u2019s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it\u2019s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,\u201d he said.  With Republicans controlling the Senate\u2019s majority, though, it was not clear if Klobuchar and Warner would prevail.  The New York Times and London\u2019s Observer reported on Saturday that private information from more than 50 million Facebook users improperly ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica, and the information has not been deleted despite Facebook\u2019s demands beginning in 2015.  Some 270,000 people allowed use of their data by a researcher, who scraped the data of all their friends as well, a move allowed by Facebook until 2015. The researcher sold the data to Cambridge, which was against Facebook rules, the newspapers said.  Cambridge Analytica worked on Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. A Trump campaign official said, though, that it used Republican data sources, not Cambridge Analytica, for its voter information.  Facebook, in a series of written statements beginning late on Friday, said its policies had been broken by Cambridge Analytica and researchers and that it was exploring legal action.  Cambridge Analytica in turn said it had deleted all the data and that the company supplying it had been responsible for obtaining it.  Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, hinted the company could make more changes to demonstrate it values privacy. \u201cWe must do better and will,\u201d he wrote on Twitter, adding that \u201cour business depends on it at every level.\u201d  Facebook said it asked for the data to be deleted in 2015 and then relied on written certifications by those involved that they had complied.  Nuala O\u2019Connor, president of the Center for Democracy & Technology, an advocacy group in Washington, D.C., said Facebook was relying on the good will of decent people rather than preparing for intentional misuse.  Moreover, she found it puzzling that Facebook knew about the abuse in 2015 but did not disclose it until Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s a long time,\u201d she said.  Britain\u2019s data protection authority and the Massachusetts attorney general on Saturday said they were launching investigations into the use of Facebook data.  \u201cIt is important that the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy,\u201d UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in a statement.

FILE PHOTO: The Facebook logo displayed on a mobile phone is seen through a magnifying glass in this picture illustration taken February 9, 2021. REUTERS\/Carlos Jasso  The move by the 17-year-old Facebook shocked Australia and sent shivers through the global news industry, which has already seen its business model upended by the titans of the technological revolution.  \u201cThis action - this bully boy action - that they\u2019ve undertaken in Australia will, I think, ignite a desire to go further amongst legislators around the world,\u201d Julian Knight, chair of the British Parliament\u2019s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, told Reuters.  \u201cWe represent people and I\u2019m sorry but you can\u2019t run bulldozer over that - and if Facebook thinks it\u2019ll do that it will face the same long-term ire as the likes of big oil and tobacco,\u201d said Knight, a member of the ruling Conservative party.  The dispute centres on a planned Australian law that would require Facebook and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google to reach commercial deals to pay news outlets whose links drive traffic to their platforms, or agree a price through arbitration.  News Corp struck a global news deal with Google, the Rupert Murdoch-controlled media company said on Wednesday.  Facebook said it had blocked a wide swathe of pages in Australia because the draft law did not clearly define news content. It said its commitment to combat misinformation had not changed, and it would restore pages that were taken down by mistake.  Knight\u2019s comments echoed those of the head of the UK\u2019s news media trade group.  News Media Association chairman Henry Faure Walker said that Facebook\u2019s action during a pandemic was \u201ca classic example of a monopoly power being the schoolyard bully, trying to protect its dominant position with scant regard for the citizens and customers it supposedly serves\u201d.  DEFINING BATTLE  Governments across the world have been puzzling for years what to do with the companies that have transformed global communication, amplified misinformation and ripped revenue away from more traditional media producers.  On Thursday, the British government took a more cautious line than some of Facebook\u2019s fiercer critics.  \u201cIt is vital people can access accurate news and information from a range of sources, particularly during a global pandemic,\u201d a government spokesman said in a statement. \u201cWe encourage Facebook and the Australian government to work together to find a solution.\u201d  British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, asked about the dispute during a visit to Paris, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a sensible conversation that is to be had between government and tech companies about making sure news is available in the most effective, efficient and cost-effective way for consumers.\u201d  Knight, who compared the innovation and disruption of the large U.S. tech companies to the invention of the printing press in Europe in the 15th century, said the tussle between them and the state would be one of the defining battles of the age.  \u201cThis (Australia) is a real test case,\u201d said Knight, who said he favoured using competition rules.  In Britain the government has commissioned reviews into digital competition and the sustainability of news.  Its biggest media publishers have agreed partnership deals with Google and Facebook but industry sources said they are also lobbying the government to do more and will be emboldened by the Australian government.  Publishers lined up to express surprise that Facebook, headed by founder Mark Zuckerberg, had taken such action.  \u201cSo much for Facebook\u2019s commitment to free speech,\u201d said a spokesman for MailOnline, one of world\u2019s most popular news websites. \u201cWe are astonished by this inflammatory move.\u201d  The Guardian Media Group, a British media company which owns the Guardian newspaper, said it was deeply concerned.  \u201cDominant online platforms are now a key gateway to news and information online.

REUTERS\/Sergio Flores  NEW YORK\/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters Breakingviews) - Facebook\u2019s presidential foes are also its customers. Elizabeth Warren and other Democrats running for the White House have turned Silicon Valley into a political punching bag, but their campaigns are big users of Facebook and other online platforms. It reflects the power of tech giants and suggests bashing them may not persuade voters.  Many Democratic candidates entering the 2020 presidential race have pledged to reject corporate funds. That makes Facebook, Instagram and other social media platforms all the more important to them both to get out their message and to raise money.  That explains why politicians like Senator Warren are active on Facebook, which reaches two out of every three adults in America. Her presidential campaign has spent more than $300,000 to advertise on Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s network so far.  She has also been the most forceful voice calling for a crackdown on tech. She says Amazon, Alphabet\u2019s Google and Facebook should be broken up because they have stifled competition and used consumer data for their own profit. Facebook temporarily pulled a few of her ads arguing to break up Big Tech.  Senator Amy Klobuchar is making antitrust one of the cornerstones of her presidential run, calling for stricter privacy and more transparency from Big Tech. She forked over more than $80,000 to reach voters on Facebook.  Other candidates have been critical of Facebook but haven\u2019t called for its breakup. Senators Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris have each spent at least $300,000 on the social network. On Thursday, Beto O\u2019Rourke jumped in. His campaign spent more than $8 million on Facebook ads in his failed Senate race last fall while President Donald Trump\u2019s committees have doled out about $10 million on his re-election bid.  Beating up on Silicon Valley is not top of mind for voters. Likely Democratic Iowa caucus-goers say they want to hear candidates talk the most about health care, climate change and income inequality, according to a new Des Moines Register\/CNN\/Mediacom Iowa Poll.  While bashing tech has become a favorite Washington pastime, it may not resonate beyond the Beltway and coastal cities. In a crowded Democratic field, candidates need the reach of Facebook.

Greene said the cases, which also involved content removed over rules on adult nudity, dangerous individuals and organizations, and violence and incitement, raised \"important line-drawing questions.\" (Link here to full list of cases)  Facebook can also ask the board for nonbinding policy recommendations, but Greene said it had not yet done so.  The board, which has been criticized for its limited remit, also aims to expand its scope to hear cases from users in early 2021 about content that has been left on the site, as well as posts taken down.  This week, a group of Facebook critics dubbed \u201cThe Real Facebook Oversight Board\u201d said it would hear three cases not yet eligible for users to take to the official oversight board, including a dispute about the Facebook account of Steve Bannon, President Donald Trump\u2019s former adviser.  Asked about this group, a spokeswoman for Facebook\u2019s Oversight Board said: \u201cLots of people have opinions about Facebook. The Oversight Board is focused on making binding decisions and issuing policy recommendations that will hold Facebook to account.\u201d","592":"PARIS (Reuters) - Negotiators from nearly 140 countries will ask Washington and its G20 partners this week to reaffirm political support for global rules to tax digital giants after the coronavirus and looming U.S. elections stalled the process, officials said.  FILE PHOTO: An activist wearing a mask depicting Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg demonstrates during the European Union finance ministers meeting, outside the EU headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, December 4, 2018 in this file photo. REUTERS\/Yves Herman\/File Photo  The hard-fought talks over how to tax digital behemoths, such as Google GOOGL.O and Facebook FB.O, are part of the biggest overhaul of international tax rules in a generation, conducted under the stewardship of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).  Negotiators are due on Thursday and Friday to wrap up months of talks on rewriting cross-border tax rules for the age of digital commerce, including a global minimum corporate tax rate.  But agreement remains elusive after high-level backing needed to finalise a deal this year has drained away after COVID-19 travel restrictions forced talks to move to Zoom and Washington began playing for time, reluctant to commit to a deal in the build-up to the Nov. 3 presidential election.  Nonetheless, the countries are likely to sign off on OECD\u2019s technical blueprints for new rules on how to apportion taxing rights to governments for cross-border business and a global minimum tax rate.  There is broad consensus to keep the process moving. Officials want G20 finance ministers to reinforce their commitment to a negotiated global deal rather than letting each country go its own way with national digital taxes, something that could add up to a hefty bill for companies.  \u201cWe\u2019re leaning towards an extension of the mandate from the end of year through 2021,\u201d one official briefed on the matter said before the talks.  A second official said that the G20 finance ministers would finalise a decision when they meet online next week.  \u201cThe OECD will certainly stay on top of this. The United States supports this process and has repeatedly warned against unilateral action outside these negotiations,\u201d the official said.  NEGOTIATING BY ZOOM  While the Trump administration initially backed a rewriting the global tax rules, Washington lost appetite for the political talks needed to finalise key technical points, officials say.  The talks\u2019 move from the OECD\u2019s Paris headquarters to hours of video conferencing also damped prospects for a swift, leaving no scope for crucial give-and-take negotiations between formal meetings.  \u201cUsually you do that in the lobby, you do that in the dinner before the negotiation, or at the breakfast or the coffee break. Zoom is fantastic but they don\u2019t provide the coffee,\u201d OECD head of tax Pascal Saint-Amans said last month.  Without a deal, companies face the proliferation of new national taxes on digital services and potential double taxation, as countries seek extra revenues to cope with the coronavirus outbreak and its fallout.  France was among the first to create its own digital tax last year, becoming the target of trade retaliation threats from Washington, which considers such national taxes as unfairly discriminatory against U.S. firms. Paris in return, accused  the United States of \u201ccreating obstacles\u201d for a global tax deal with demands for a voluntary opt-out for U.S. companies.  The Trump administration slapped in July additional duties on French cosmetics and handbags, but suspended them until January. France put its tax on hold until the end of 2020, but has warned it would reinstate it the absence of a global deal this year and the European Commission has committed to reviving plans in 2021 for an EU-wide digital tax to finance a new European recovery fund.  \u201cThey\u2019re worried the OECD won\u2019t be able to pull this off because the U.S. has been back and forth on its position,\u201d EY Global Vice Chair of Tax Kate Barton said.","593":"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Facebook Inc\u2019s operations chief Sheryl Sandberg said on Wednesday that the world\u2019s largest social network needed to win back public trust after facing scandals for violating its users\u2019 privacy.  The social media platform is investing billions of dollars a year to improve the security of its network, Sandberg said in an interview hosted by German newspaper Die Zeit and UK law firm CMS at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.  \u201cWe did not anticipate all of the risks from connecting so many people,\u201d Sandberg said, adding that the site had added features that give users greater control over their personal information.  The 15-year-old technology company has been a darling of California\u2019s Silicon Valley, making stars out of its founder, chief executive and chairman Mark Zuckerberg, and Sandberg, known for her feminist manifesto \u201cLean In\u201d. But its shares have fallen roughly 33 percent since July to $144 due to concerns about user privacy.  Last year, the company was buffeted by revelations that UK consultancy Cambridge Analytica had improperly acquired data on millions of its U.S. users to target election advertising.  \u201cWe need to earn back trust,\u201d Sandberg said.  Some of Facebook\u2019s major shareholders have pushed for Zuckerberg, who has majority control of the company, to step down as chairman.  Sandberg said he should remain both chair and CEO. She said that she also plans to remain at Facebook, where she has worked since 2008.  \u201cI think I have a job to do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a job I really want to do.\u201d  Sandberg said that if Facebook had to change its business model and charge users a subscription fee instead of collecting advertising revenue, far fewer people would be able to use it.  \u201cFundamentally disallowing our business model would harm a lot of people all over the world.\u201d  She said her grassroots women\u2019s movement, spurred by the publication of \u201cLean In\u201d, was still going strong. But, asked if she was considering a run for U.S. president in the 2020 election, she replied : \u201cIt\u2019s not on my agenda.\u201d","594":"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc FB.O on Wednesday took down a network of pages and accounts used by a right-wing Brazilian activist group, cracking down on what it called a misinformation network ahead of elections in October.  FILE PHOTO: Figurines are seen in front of the Facebook logo in this illustration taken March 20, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  Facebook said in a statement that it deactivated 196 pages and 87 accounts in Brazil for their part in \u201ca coordinated network that hid behind fake Facebook accounts and misled people about the nature and origin of its content, all for the purpose of sowing division and spreading misinformation.\u201d  The statement did not identify the pages or users involved, and a Facebook representative declined to identify them.  However, sources told Reuters that the network was run by senior organizers from Movimento Brazil Livre (MBL) or \u201cFree Brazil Movement.\u201d  MBL later said in a statement on Twitter that several of its organizers had been affected, confirming the Reuters report.  The group rose to prominence in 2016 leading protests demanding the impeachment of leftist former President Dilma Rousseff with an aggressive style of online politics that has helped to polarize debate in Brazil.  The MBL statement criticized Facebook for blocking several organizers without giving a full explanation, complaining that some of the banned accounts were using members\u2019 real names and personal information.  \u201cFreedom of expression and democracy are pillars of the MBL. We will use all of the legal, political and media resources offered by democracy to recover the blocked pages and undo this persecution,\u201d the group said.  A federal prosecutor in the state of Goias called on Facebook to disclose the pages and accounts it had deactivated, along with a justification for each, within 48 hours.  Facebook declined to comment on the prosecutor\u2019s request or the criticism from MBL.  The deactivated pages, which together had more than half a million followers, ranged from sensationalist general news feeds to political fare with an openly conservative slant, carrying names such as Jornalivre and O Diario Nacional.  By misrepresenting the shared control of the pages, MBL organizers were able to spread their coordinated messaging as if it were coming from various independent news outlets, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Facebook said it took down the network in Brazil after a \u201crigorous investigation\u201d because the profiles involved were false or misleading, violating its authenticity policies. The social network has a separate set of tools to discourage the distribution of fake news with help from outside fact checkers.  Facebook has been under heavy pressure to stop the use of fake accounts and other types of deception on its network.  The company last year acknowledged that the platform had been used for what it called \u201cinformation operations\u201d employing fake accounts and other methods to influence public opinion during the U.S. election in 2016, and it pledged to crack down.  U.S. intelligence agencies say the Russian government engaged in a campaign to influence the U.S. presidential election, and cases of political groups using social media in deceptive ways have since emerged around the world.  There was no indication of foreign involvement in the MBL network taken down on Wednesday, the sources said.","595":"A federal judge has signed off on Facebook Inc.\u2019s record-breaking $5 billion settlement with U.S. the Federal Trade Commission that requires the social media company to enhance its safeguards on user data.

The original cryptocurrency hit $11,247.62 on the Bitstamp exchange late on Sunday, its highest since March last year. It later pulled back, and was last up 1.9% at $11,039.62.  Facebook said last week it planned to launch a new cryptocurrency called Libra, though the announcement immediately led to questions from regulators and politicians across the world.  Mati Greenspan, an analyst at eToro, said bitcoin\u2019s gains underscored growing optimism among retail investors that Facebook\u2019s plans were part of a wider trend of major companies adopting cryptocurrencies.  \u201cThey believe that Libra will create mass awareness of cryptocurrencies and act as a gateway to adoption.\u201d  (Graphic: Bitcoin tests $11,000 - tmsnrt.rs\/2Ft6UJU)  BITCOIN \u201cHALVING\u201d IN 2020  One of the biggest reasons for the bitcoin rally, analysts said, is the cryptocurrency\u2019s next \u201chalving\u201d in May 2020, where the rewards offered to bitcoin miners shrink. That has constrained the supply of the digital currency.  Bitcoin relies on so-called \u201cmining\u201d computers that validate blocks of transactions by competing to solve mathematical puzzles every 10 minutes. In return, the first to solve the puzzle and clear the transaction is rewarded new bitcoins. Bitcoin technology was designed in such a way that it cuts the reward for miners in half every four years, a move meant to keep a lid on inflation.  The mining reward is currently 12.5 bitcoins. In the next halving in 2020, the reward will fall to 6.25 new bitcoins.  \u201cBitcoin always does a 200% pump within 1 year before the halving and another much, much bigger pump in the year after the halving,\u201d said Stuttgart-based Marius Kramer, a social media influencer who currently works with crypto investing app Ember Fund.  Other traders cited geopolitical factors from tensions in the Gulf region to the U.S.-China trade war as fuelling interest in bitcoin, which has more than doubled in price since March.  Thomas Puech of Enigma Securities, a London-based firm that specializes in larger size over-the-counter cryptocurrency deals, said growing tensions between the United States and Iran were \u201cgas\u201d for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  In late March, bitcoin broke out of a spell of limited price moves. So far this year it has surged nearly 200%, an ascent peppered by double-digit price swings.  Bitcoin\u2019s volatility has been a boon to larger investors such as hedge funds, and other investors searching for returns as central banks across the world lean toward lower interest rates, said Puech.","597":"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Dozens of Australian companies, charities and information providers reacted with anger on Thursday after being shut down by Facebook, imploring the social media giant to restore their pages as calls for users to delete the platform grew.  FILE PHOTO: The Facebook logo is displayed on a mobile phone in this picture illustration taken December 2, 2019.

Rachel Chappell who founded a Sydney-based community group \u2018North Shore Mums\u2019 nine years ago woke up to see her Facebook page with its 35,000 followers disappear.  \u201cWe\u2019re a mum\u2019s website. We are small and niche. This is not fair,\u201d said Chappell, who built up a small business for mothers, writing about family-friendly cafes and pets for the local community, and attracting advertising.  \u201cI think they are just bullies. They are shooting themselves in the foot. I spend my A$20,000 marketing budget to promote our content with Facebook,\u201d said Chappell, adding the move had \u201ccompletely shaken\u201d her.  Facebook\u2019s reach in Australia is powerful. It has more than 11 million users in a population of 25 million and takes in about 24% of the country\u2019s advertising spend, according to the competition regulator.  A Facebook representative in Australia did not reply to a request for comment. A later Facebook statement said the ban should not affect government pages but \u201cas the law does not provide clear guidance on the definition of news content, we have taken a broad definition\u201d.  \u201cCUTE CATS AND CONSPIRACIES\u201d  Several organisations posted social media messages directing followers to their websites or other platforms including Twitter and Facebook-owned Instagram.  Journalist Jelisa Apps said many rural areas and country towns relied on their local paper\u2019s Facebook pages as physical copies were stripped back over the years. Other social media platforms were not as widely used, she said.  \u201cI\u2019ve just checked my hometown\u2019s newspaper page. It\u2019s gone. This is a real shame. An undervalued audience having their news further limited,\u201d Apps said on Twitter.  Peter Lewis, director of the Australia Institute\u2019s Centre for Responsible Technology said Facebook\u2019s decision would make it a weaker social network.  Facebook \u201cis destroying its social licence to operate,\u201d Lewis said.  \u201cWithout fact-based news to anchor it, Facebook will become little more than a cute cats and conspiracy theories (page),\u201d he added.  \u201cIf Facebook determines to treat Australians with such contempt, Australians should respond by ending its use of Facebook and using alternate ways to connect online.\u201d","598":"(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is considering asking a court to stop Facebook Inc from moving ahead with plans to integrate its WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger subsidiaries, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.  FILE PHOTO: Facebook logos are seen on a mobile phone in this picture illustration taken December 2, 2019. REUTERS\/Johanna Geron  Facebook shares closed 2.7% lower, reflecting fears the potential regulatory move could be a first step toward forcing the company to sell apps WhatsApp and Instagram, its fast-growing acquisitions.  Facebook has plans to allow users of its units Messenger, WhatsApp and the direct messaging system within Instagram to communicate with each other, and end-to-end encryption will be extended across the three services.  A source familiar with the matter said the FTC has not asked Facebook to halt the integration, a step that would normally precede a legal challenge. The Wall Street Journal said the FTC could file for an injunction to halt the integration as early as January.  Apart from antitrust concerns, Facebook and other tech giants are facing criticism over privacy lapses, how they handle vast quantities of consumer data, and accusations of bias in the polarized U.S. political environment.  Facebook and the FTC declined to comment.  Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg announced plans in March to integrate Facebook\u2019s messaging services as part of a proposed shift toward more private forms of social networking.  Zuckerberg\u2019s integration strategy reflects the importance of Instagram and WhatsApp as Facebook\u2019s flagship app struggles to attract new young users in the company\u2019s most lucrative markets.  Instagram ads drive much of Facebook\u2019s revenue growth, while the company is slowly moving toward making money from WhatsApp, which has surged to a user base of 1.5 billion people since its $22 billion acquisition in 2014.  The properties are already integrated to some degree, with users able to link their accounts and advertisers able to use one system to place ads across different platforms.  Encrypting messaging systems will restrict Facebook\u2019s ability to see the content of users\u2019 messages, but the company has not divulged whether the integration plan may deepen other types of data sharing between the units.  Facebook, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc all face antitrust investigations by the Justice Department and House of Representatives Judiciary Committee.  The FTC was also known to be investigating Facebook while groups of state attorneys general are looking at Facebook and Google.  U.S. Attorney General William Barr said on Tuesday he hoped to have Justice Department investigations of the big tech platforms completed next year.  Barr said the Justice Department review was not limited to antitrust, but that looking for anti-competitive behavior was \u201cfront and center.\u201d","599":"FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: Demonstrators gather during a protest over alleged police brutality in Lagos, Nigeria October 17, 2020.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Although smartphone messaging apps are not known for displaying ads, Facebook has said that targeting the 1.3 billion people who use its Messenger service with ads will be an important part of the company\u2019s long-term revenue growth.  Silicon Valley tech firms are pouring money into augmented reality, a mix of the real and digital worlds best known from the game Pokemon Go.  Facebook, at a tech conference that begins on Tuesday, is launching a new toolkit for software developers to make augmented reality features.  David Marcus, head of Facebook\u2019s Messenger app, said in an interview that shoppers will be able to visualize and potentially test out products that advertisers have made available. Sephora, one of the first businesses that will use the feature, will let people virtually try on cosmetics.  Similar augmented-reality features have proliferated on the apps of retailers such Amazon.com Inc and Ikea, which allow people to see how a toaster or couch would look in a room.  Facebook, the world\u2019s largest social media network, has been encouraging businesses to use Messenger to talk with consumers, sometimes for customer service.  Having businesses using Messenger helps Facebook\u2019s advertising business, Marcus said. Marketers can place ads directly in the service, and Facebook sells ads in its News Feed that connect to Messenger conversations.  Messenger and the News Feed create a feedback loop like a \u201cflywheel\u201d for ad sales, Marcus said.  Four businesses are participating in the launch: electronics company Asustek Computer Inc, automaker Kia Motors Corp, clothing company Nike Inc and Sephora, a unit of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE.  WhatsApp, another Facebook-owned messaging service with more than 1 billion users, has sworn off advertising. WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum said on Monday he was leaving. The Washington Post reported he was doing so in part after conflicts about advertising, which he opposes.  Marcus said he was not worried about ads turning off Messenger users. People must opt in to talk with a business on the service. \u201cPeople actually find it helpful,\u201d he said.

The company has since then provided 315,000 documents equivalent to 1.7 million pages to the Commission.  \u201cThe exceptionally broad nature of the Commission\u2019s requests means we would be required to turn over predominantly irrelevant documents that have nothing to do with the Commission\u2019s investigations, including highly sensitive personal information such as employees\u2019 medical information, personal financial documents, and private information about family members of employees,\u201d Facebook associate general counsel Tim Lamb said in a statement.  \u201cWe think such requests should be reviewed by the EU Courts.\u201d  The Commission said it would defend its case in court.

FILE PHOTO: Silhouettes of mobile users are seen next to a screen projection of Instagram logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  Facebook said it also had suspended three separate networks operated from Iran. The Russian network \u201cshowed some links\u201d to Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency (IRA), Facebook said, an organization Washington has said was used by Moscow to meddle in the 2016 U.S. election.  \u201cWe see this operation targeting largely U.S. public debate and engaging in the sort of political issues that are challenging and sometimes divisive in the U.S. right now,\u201d said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy.  \u201cWhenever you do that, a piece of what you engage on are topics that are going to matter for the election. But I can\u2019t say exactly what their goal was.\u201d  Facebook also announced new steps to fight foreign interference and misinformation ahead of the November 2020 election, including labeling state-controlled media outlets and adding greater protections for elected officials and candidates who may be vulnerable targets for hacking.  U.S. security officials have warned that Russia, Iran and other countries could attempt to sway the result of next year\u2019s presidential vote. Officials say they are on high alert for signs of foreign influence campaigns on social media.  Moscow and Tehran have repeatedly denied the allegations.  Gleicher said the IRA-linked network used 50 Instagram accounts and one Facebook account to gather 246,000 followers, about 60% of which were in the United States.  The earliest accounts dated to January this year and the operation appeared to be \u201cfairly immature in its development,\u201d he said.  \u201cThey were pretty focused on audience-building, which is the thing you do first as you\u2019re sort of trying to set up an operation.\u201d  Ben Nimmo, a researcher with social media analysis company Graphika who Facebook commissioned, said the flagged accounts shared material that could appeal to Republican and Democratic voters alike.  Most of the messages plagiarized material authored by leading conservative and progressive pundits. This included recycling comments initially shared on Twitter that criticized U.S. congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and current President Donald Trump.  \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting in this set is so much of what they were doing is copying and pasting genuine material from actual Americans,\u201d Nimmo told Reuters. \u201cThis may be indicative of an effort to hide linguistic deficiencies, which have made them easier to detect in the past.\u201d  Attorneys for Concord Management and Consulting LLC have denied any wrongdoing. U.S. prosecutors say the firm is controlled by Russian catering tycoon Evgeny Prigozhin and helped orchestrate the IRA\u2019s operations.  Gleicher said the separate Iranian network his team identified used more than 100 fake and hacked accounts on Facebook and Instagram to target U.S. users and some French-speaking parts of North Africa. Some accounts also repurposed Iranian state media stories to target users in Latin American countries including Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Mexico.  The activity was connected to an Iranian campaign first identified in August last year, which Reuters showed aimed to direct internet users to a sprawling web of pseudo-news websites which repackaged propaganda from Iranian state media.

FILE PHOTO: Stickers bearing the Facebook logo are pictured at Facebook Inc's F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S., April 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  The senators, Republican Josh Hawley and Democrats Mark Warner and Richard Blumenthal, offered the bill at a time when there is growing concern that Facebook, along with Alphabet\u2019s Google, have become so powerful that smaller rivals are unable to lure away their users.  The bill currently does not have a counterpart in the U.S. House of Representatives, which it will need to become law.  The bill would require communications platforms with more than 100 million monthly active members - Facebook has more than two billion - to allow its users to easily move, or port, their data to another network, Warner\u2019s office said in a statement.  Under the bill the companies would be required to maintain an interface to facilitate interoperability. Or users would be allowed to choose another company to manage a user\u2019s account settings, content, and online interactions, the statement said.  Portability means that a user who is unhappy with Facebook, for example, would be able to pull postings, comments and photos off Facebook and move them to another site. Interoperability means that users on different platforms - say Facebook and Twitter - would be able to communicate in the same way as email users are able to email to anyone without regard to provider.  The trade group NetChoice, which counts Google and Facebook among its members, said that the bill would do little to protect consumers.  \u201cData portability will inevitably endanger data security,\u201d said Carl Szabo, general counsel at NetChoice. \u201cOnline hackers and criminals looking to steal consumer data will benefit.\u201d  The idea of portability, which is already part of European law, has the support of Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat who leads the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee.  Data portability has been promoted as giving consumers the power to move their data, which could spur the growth of social media alternatives that offer features such as greater privacy or less advertising.  Facebook has been hit by a number of privacy-related issues recently, including a glitch that exposed to its employees the passwords of millions of users which had been stored in readable format within its internal systems. The social media giant is also under strict data protections imposed by the company\u2019s $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, which was announced in July.  \u201cBy enabling portability, interoperability, and delegatability, this bill will help put consumers in the driver\u2019s seat when it comes to how and where they use social media,\u201d said Sen. Warner, a former technology entrepreneur and venture capitalist.  But the Electronic Frontier Foundation has pointed out that on its own \u201cdata portability cannot magically improve competition; the ability to take your data to another service is not helpful if there are no viable competitors.\u201d  Facebook said in September it \u201csupports the principle of data portability\u201d but did not outline specific future actions, and tech industry lobbyists at the Internet Association support the concept.","614":"LONDON (Reuters) - Facebook\u2019s fledging cryptocurrency will raise questions for both society and government that need close examination, a senior official at Britain\u2019s financial watchdog said on Tuesday, in another sign that the planned project will face deep scrutiny.

Facebook will likely face unprecedented regulatory scrutiny over Libra, planned for launch by the end of June 2020. The coin would mark the social media giant\u2019s entry into one of the least-regulated areas of finance.  The response of domestic and international financial regulators and monetary authorities to the Libra project will have a crucial impact on its prospects.  Though some, including the FCA, have said they have met Facebook to discuss the project, there are still many questions over exactly how it will operate.  Libra faced mounting attention last week as European central bankers and regulators demanded greater detail on the project.  Crucial decisions on such projects lie with lawmakers, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), an umbrella group for central banks, has warned. Politicians need to quickly coordinate regulatory responses to new risks as Facebook and other tech firms move into finance, the BIS said last month.  In general, the FCA looks at any so-called cryptoasset - a catch-all term that includes bitcoin and other digital tokens - on a case-by-case basis, Woolard said. It asks questions on whether it would benefit competitive markets and consumers, or cause harm by raising complexity and others risks, he added.  \u201cIt is crucial that we also think about the reality \u2013 the technical details, the technology; and the legal position.\u201d","615":"Reuters - ** In wake of plunge that saw Facebook FB.O press against significant support, shares attempting to show their good side again on the charts  FILE PHOTO: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, appears on stage during a town hall at Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, U.S., September 27, 2015.

Reuters-Facebook Journalism Project course on Identifying and Tackling Manipulated Media  This year the Reuters newsroom discovered, among many other examples, that a harrowing video shared during Cyclone Idai had been shot in Libya five years earlier. We watched videos going viral following Brazils\u2019 Brumadinho dam collapse that were from different, unrelated incidents. And during conflict between India and Pakistan in February this year, we saw numerous false clips circulating, including one taken from a video game.  As social media has evolved to become a critical part of newsgathering, it has also become a minefield, where misinformation travels rapidly. Newsrooms have had to adapt, growing journalists\u2019 verification skills in order to be able to filter powerful, authentic eyewitness media from that which distorts the truth.  Into this landscape comes a new threat: that of so-called \u201cdeepfakes\u201d \u2013 a form of synthetically-generated media. Interest around deepfakes has grown dramatically this year. Google Trends data shows that searches for the term peaked in June, around the time a deepfake video was released that featured the Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. As we close this year, the number of searches for \u201cdeepfake\u201d is five times\u2019 higher than at the end of 2018.  (Link to chart: here)  Despite this growing discussion, it still remains a hypothetical threat for many, as the technology to make these types of manipulated videos is not yet widespread. Cyber security start-up Deeptrace counted around 14,600 deepfakes online as of August 2019, but the vast majority are on adult entertainment sites - highly damaging to the individuals involved, but not to the news ecosystem.  Since Reuters carried out a newsroom experiment into deepfakes in March, we\u2019ve seen an incredible appetite from our own journalists and many others worldwide to learn more about the technology behind these new forms of manipulation, in order to better prepare themselves for what may lie ahead. This is encouraging \u2013 because if there is one key takeaway from our research this year, it\u2019s that the more familiar Reuters journalists were with emerging forms of synthetic media, the readily they were able to identify potential red flags and consider a range of possible scenarios.  That\u2019s why we decided to partner with the Facebook Journalism Project to produce an in-depth course into manipulated media. It includes explanations and examples of new forms of synthetic media, along with an assessment of the full range of ways visual material may mislead. It also challenges participants to place themselves into a breaking news situation and consider the steps they can take in order to establish the facts around the pictures and video they obtain.  We know that visual misinformation is very much a global problem, and we\u2019ve therefore produced this course in four major languages, with more to follow. We hope that it will be informative, thought-provoking and will help lay the ground for newsrooms to build upon their own verification strategies.

The information technology services provider will also eliminate up to 7,000 jobs in its other units to invest in growth areas such as cloud and internet of things to cushion the impact from a decline in spending by its financial customers.  The exit from some parts of the content moderation business will hurt financial performance in the coming year, Cognizant said.  Chief Executive Officer Brian Humphries said on a call with analysts the company had decided that work focused on determining whether content violated client standards was not part of its strategic vision. The work \u201ccan involve objectionable materials,\u201d he said.  Cognizant had about 500 workers in India\u2019s southern city of Hyderabad looking for sensitive topics or profane language in Facebook videos, Reuters reported in May. The Verge also reported that some Cognizant employees scouring potentially objectionable content for Facebook faced difficult conditions.  A Cognizant spokesman did not say whether the Verge story led to the decision described on Wednesday. The spokesman said the move reflected the company\u2019s new strategy and that Cognizant was not completely exiting content moderation.  \u201cWe\u2019ll work with our partners during this transition to ensure there\u2019s no impact on our ability to review content and keep people safe,\u201d said Arun Chandra, vice president of scaled operations at Facebook.  Facebook works with at least five outsourcing vendors in at least eight countries on content review, according to a Reuters tally. (reut.rs\/2q6kJcb)  In response to this change, Facebook will increase the number of reviewers at a review site in Texas, which is operated by a different partner, Chandra added.  Facebook's spokesperson said the company's current plan is to move some work to another content review site operated by Genpact Ltd G.N in Texas.  The social network said in December it has about 15,000 people, a mix of contractors and employees, working on content review and had over 20 content review sites around the world.  Cognizant had come under pressure after activist investor Elliott urged the company to boost shareholder value after disclosing a more than 4% stake in November 2016. The hedge fund exited the stake last year.  The company said it expects to save between $500 million and $550 million in 2021 and record restructuring charges of between $150 million and $200 million by the end of next year.  The New Jersey-based company said revenue from its financial services segment rose 1.9% to $1.49 billion while that from healthcare services dropped 1.2% to $1.18 billion. The two segments make up more than half of the company\u2019s total revenue.  Cognizant has warned of lower spending by its banking sector clients in the second half of the year.  The company said it now expects full-year revenue growth of between 4.6% and 4.9%, compared with its earlier guidance of a growth of between 3.9% and 4.9%.  Excluding items, the company earned $1.08 per share, above estimates of $1.05 per share.","618":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard launched a broadside against Facebook\u2019s Libra digital currency project on Wednesday, saying it faces a \u201ccore set of legal and regulatory challenges\u201d including clarity about how it would be tied to some basket of underlying assets.  Facebook\u2019s concept of Libra as a \u201cstablecoin\u201d - a digital currency linked to government-backed money or other sound assets to avoid the wild fluctuations of pure cryptocurrencies like bitcoin - remains unproven, Brainard said, with an unclear set of rights for consumers.  \u201cWhat would set Facebook\u2019s Libra apart, if it were to proceed, is the combination of an active-user network representing more than a third of the global population with the issuance of a private digital currency opaquely tied to a basket of sovereign currencies,\u201d Brainard said in remarks prepared for delivery at a conference in Frankfurt. \u201cWithout requisite safeguards, stablecoin networks at global scale may put consumers at risk.\u201d  Her remarks suggest that Facebook\u2019s Libra project has yet to gain traction among key regulators. Intended as a consortium of companies that would back the digital currency with hard assets, Libra has suffered other setbacks with the withdrawal of major payments companies like Paypal, Mastercard and Visa.  Central banks globally are debating how to manage the advance of digital finance technology, particularly the distributed ledger systems used by bitcoin. Some analysts feel it is inevitable that central banks will ultimately issue digital currencies of their own.  With the potential to lower the cost and up the speed of transmitting money, Brainard said the technology does have advantages. But she said there are also \u201cadvantages associated with current arrangements\u201d based on the issuance of physical cash.  Cryptocurrencies, she said, still must clear hurdles including the possibility of fraud and their use for activities like money laundering. Theft and fraud losses associated with cryptocurrencies are estimated to have more than doubled to around $4.4 billion in 2019 from $1.7 billion the year before, Brainard said.  \u201cGiven the stakes, any global payments network should be expected to meet a high threshold of legal and regulatory safeguards before launching operations,\u201d she said.","619":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc has removed \u201cpseudoscience\u201d as an option for advertisers that want to target audiences, a category available until this week even as the world\u2019s largest social media network vowed to curb misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic.

The company eliminated the pseudoscience category from its \u201cdetailed targeting\u201d list on Wednesday, the spokeswoman said by phone, after tech news site The Markup showed that it could advertise a post targeting people interested in pseudoscience.  The Markup demonstrated that Facebook was allowing such ads after saying it would police COVID-19 misinformation on its platform. More than 78 million Facebook users were interested in \u201cpseudoscience,\u201d it said, citing Facebook\u2019s ad portal.  Misinformation about the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, from bogus cures to wide-ranging conspiracy theories, has also spread on rival social media platforms such Twitter Inc and YouTube, the video service of Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google.  Advocacy group Avaaz reported last week that a sample of 104 coronavirus-related pieces of misinformation content on Facebook analyzed by the group had reached over 117 million estimated views.  Data gathered by ProPublica in 2016 shows that Facebook assigned \u201cpseudoscience\u201d to users at that time, suggesting the category has been available for several years.  The Facebook spokeswoman said in her email that the pseudoscience category should have been removed in a previous review.  \u201cWe will continue to review our interest categories,\u201d she said.  Facebook has announced several initiatives to combat the spread of false COVID-19 claims, including removing content that could cause \u201cimminent physical harm\u201d and alerting people who have engaged with such misinformation, with a link to the World Health Organization website.  The company has also banned exploitative tactics in ads and banned ads for medical face masks, hand sanitizer, disinfecting wipes and COVID-19 test kits.  However, a test by Consumer Reports in April showed Facebook approving ads containing coronavirus misinformation, including false claims that the virus was a hoax or that people could stay healthy through small daily doses of bleach.

FILE PHOTO: Balloons are seen in front of a logo at Facebook's headquarters in London, Britain, December 4, 2017. REUTERS\/Toby Melville\/File Photo - RC1AE21EBF40  The postcard verification is Facebook\u2019s latest effort to respond to criticism from lawmakers, security experts and election integrity watchdog groups that it and other social media companies failed to detect and later responded slowly to Russia\u2019s use of their platforms to spread divisive political content, including disinformation, during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  Facebook revealed the plans a day after U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller unsealed an indictment accusing 13 Russians and three Russian companies of conducting a criminal and espionage conspiracy using social media to interfere in the election by boosting Republican Donald Trump and denigrating Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.  The process of using postcards containing a specific code will be required for advertising that mentions a specific candidate running for a federal office, Katie Harbath, Facebook\u2019s global director of policy programs, said. The requirement will not apply to issue-based political ads, she said.  \u201cIf you run an ad mentioning a candidate, we are going to mail you a postcard and you will have to use that code to prove you are in the United States,\u201d Harbath said at a weekend conference of the National Association of Secretaries of State, where executives from Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google also spoke.  \u201cIt won\u2019t solve everything,\u201d Harbath said in a brief interview with Reuters following her remarks.  But sending codes through old-fashioned mail was the most effective method the tech company could come up with to prevent Russians and other bad actors from purchasing ads while posing as someone else, Harbath said.

Twitter said it suspended 936 accounts and the operations appeared to be a coordinated state-backed effort originating in China. It said these accounts were just the most active portions of this campaign and that a \u201clarger, spammy network\u201d of approximately 200,000 accounts had been proactively suspended before they were substantially active.  Facebook said it had removed accounts and pages from a small network after a tip from Twitter. It said that its investigation found links to individuals associated with the Chinese government.  The Hong Kong protests, which have presented one of the biggest challenges for Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012, began in June as opposition to a now-suspended bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts. They have since swelled into wider calls for democracy.

Australia has introduced laws that would force internet giant Google and social media heavyweight Facebook Inc to negotiate payments to domestic media outlets whose content links drive traffic to their platforms.  However, the Big Tech firms have called the laws unworkable and said last month they would withdraw key services from Australia if the regulations went ahead. Those services include Google\u2019s search engine, which has 94% of the country\u2019s search market, according to industry data.  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has since spoken with Morrison about the new rules, the tech company told Reuters, and on Monday, Morrison said the software company was ready to grow the presence of its search tool Bing, the distant No. 2 player.  \u201cI can tell you, Microsoft\u2019s pretty confident, when I spoke to Satya,\u201d Morrison told reporters in Canberra, without giving further detail of the conversation.  \u201cWe just want the rules in the digital world to be the same that exist in the real world, in the physical world,\u201d Morrison added.  A Microsoft spokeswoman confirmed the discussion took place but declined to comment, because the company was not directly involved in the laws.

FILE PHOTO: A 3D printed Google logo is placed on broken glass in front of displayed Australian flag in this illustration taken, January 22, 2021. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The dispute is being closely watched worldwide since it would be the biggest challenge yet to how the U.S. tech companies that dominate social media and search engines use news on their websites.  WHAT DOES THE LEGISLATION SAY?  * The planned law states that Australian news outlets can negotiate individually or collectively with Facebook and Google over payment for content used on the tech firms\u2019 sites. Other tech firms may be added if they are deemed big enough.  * If the parties cannot reach an agreement, an arbitrator will decide whose offer is more reasonable. If Facebook or Google break any resulting agreements, they can be fined up to A$10 million ($7.4 million) in civil penalties.  * The law also requires tech firms give media outlets notice when they change search algorithms in a way affecting the order in which content appears. They must also share their use of consumer data extracted from news content on their sites.  * The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) began investigating search engine and social media companies in 2017 and worked with the federal government on drafting the rules, which are the subject of a parliamentary inquiry but expected to be passed into law.  * While internet and media companies have battled in other jurisdictions, notably in Germany over the copyright rules for news snippets and other items published by Google, Australia\u2019s proposal represents the most expansive reform.  WHY WAS THE LAW PROPOSED?  * In recent years, traditional media companies operating in Australia have suffered huge hits to income streams, such as subscriptions and advertising. For every A$100 spent on online advertising in Australia, excluding classifieds, nearly one-third goes to Google and Facebook, the competition regulator has said.  * In 2019, the regulator published a report stating news outlets lacked bargaining power when negotiating with digital firms over compensation for content posted on online platforms. It said this was a problem because those same publishers relied on Facebook and Google to reach many of their consumers.  * The government wanted the tech giants to abide by a voluntary code. Citing lack of progress in discussions, it decided that legislation was necessary.  WHAT HAS THE RESPONSE BEEN?  * The local arm of News Corp is a vocal supporter of the legislation. It partly blamed the tech companies for the closure of dozens of mastheads in 2020.  * Google and Facebook say they help connect media outlets with consumers, boosting their subscriptions and enabling them to charge advertisers more.  * Facebook says it has sent billions of clicks a year to Australian news websites via articles appearing on users\u2019 pages, and has threatened to remove news links from Australian users\u2019 feeds.  * Google says it is prepared to pay for content, though no major media organisation has agreed to its terms. Google has said it will withdraw its main search engine from Australia if the laws go ahead.  * Australia is planning more regulation of large technology companies in the media industry. The ACCC has suggested new data-sharing rules which would challenge the dominance of Google and Facebook in the online advertising market, and will publish a report in March on the role of Google and Apple Inc in the smartphone software industry.  * Australia has previously engaged in lengthy battles with major corporations.

The vast majority of posts \u2013 92% \u2013 offered live animals, including birds of prey, while gibbons, langurs, wild cats, and hornbills were in high demand.  Wildlife charities said more than 500 posts, accounts, and groups were taken down in April and July after they alerted Facebook, which said its staffers remove content that breaches rules as soon as they become aware.  \u201cWe are committed to working with law enforcement authorities around the world to help tackle the illegal trade of wildlife,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson said.

Naing Zaw Htun, a senior forestry department official, told Reuters social media had become \u201cone of the major drivers of the wildlife trafficking\u201d, and the aim of the captive breeding plan was to reduce poaching.  Fighting the illegal online wildlife trade poses a serious challenge for governments across the region, where many national laws lag behind, said Elizabeth John, senior communications officer for TRAFFIC, a non-government organisation.

WWF said four Facebook accounts and seven groups, each with thousands of members, were removed in response to their research in Myanmar.  The company says it uses a combination of technology and reports from NGOs and others to detect and remove content.

Apple offers what are known as certificates that let businesses have deep controls over iPhones, with the potential to remotely install apps, monitor app usage and access, and delete data owned by a business on an iPhone. Apple designed the program for organizations whose staff use iPhones for official duties, when privacy needs are different from phones for personal use.  On Tuesday, technology news site TechCrunch reported that Facebook was paying users as young as 13 years old to install an app called Facebook Research. The app used Apple\u2019s business tools to ask for an iPhone user\u2019s permission to install so-called virtual private network software that can track browsing habits.  Apple ejected Facebook from the business app program, saying in a statement on Wednesday the program was \u201csolely for the internal distribution of apps within an organization.\u201d  \u201cFacebook has been using their membership to distribute a data-collecting app to consumers, which is a clear breach of their agreement with Apple,\u201d Apple said in the statement.

However, a disclaimer on the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says: \u201cThe reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable\u201d and \u201ca report to VAERS does not mean that the vaccine caused the adverse event, only that the adverse event occurred some time after vaccination\u201d (here).  An example of the limitations of the data is shown later in the video when the narrator looks into reports of patients who had died some point after receiving a vaccine. For example, as she reads out the details of one patient (timestamp 4.45), an 89-year-old with dementia who died five days after COVID-19 vaccination, she encounters a line reading: \u201cDue to proximity of vaccination we felt we should report the death, even though it is not believed to be related\u201d.

She lists out details but does not mention the Diagnostic Lab Data entry which says that the cause of death was anaphylactic shock brought about by the poisonous effects of \u201cingested food stuff\u201d.  Despite these limitations, the narrator asks why newspapers are not covering the reports in the database.  The CDC explains on its website (here) that that \u201cVAERS serves as an early warning system to detect possible safety issues with U.S. vaccines by collecting information about adverse events (possible side effects or health problems) that occur after vaccination\u201d.  Therefore these reports often precede investigation.  In a section (here) on potential side effects from COVID-19 vaccines, the CDC website says: \u201cCDC follows up on any report of death to request additional information and learn more about what occurred and to determine whether the death was a result of the vaccine or unrelated.\u201d  \u201cTo date, VAERS has not detected patterns in cause of death that would indicate a safety problem with COVID-19 vaccines.\u201d  The CDC estimated that about 1.3 million COVID-19 vaccine doses were administered to residents in long-term care facilities as of Jan. 18, 2021.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is seen testifying remotely during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing titled, \"Breaking the News: Censorship, Suppression, and the 2020 Election,? on Facebook and Twitter's content moderation practices, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., November 17, 2020. REUTERS\/Hannah McKay\/Pool  The CEOs, Jack Dorsey of Twitter and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, defended their content moderation practices at a congressional hearing scheduled after the platforms decided to block stories from the New York Post that made claims about the son of then-Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.  The move incited uproar among Republican lawmakers who have consistently accused the companies of anti-conservative bias.  In his opening remarks, Judiciary Committee chairman Lindsey Graham asked: \u201cWhat I want to try to find out is if you\u2019re not a newspaper at Twitter or Facebook, then why do you have editorial control over the New York Post?\u201d  He said he did not think articles on Hunter Biden, refuted by the Biden campaign, needed to be flagged or excluded from distribution.  Democrats focused on the spread of misinformation by Trump, a Republican, and his supporters. They pushed the companies to limit the spread of false and misleading content ahead of elections in Georgia, where two Republican incumbent senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, are facing run-offs against well-funded Democratic opponents - contests that will likely determine which party controls the Senate.  Zuckerberg and Dorsey admitted the companies have made some mistakes, but mostly defended their policies.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  However, broader problems with their content moderation decisions, especially around violent speech, became evident when Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, asked Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg if he would commit to taking down the account of former Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon after he suggested the beheading of two senior U.S. officials.  Zuckerberg refused. \u201cSenator, no. That\u2019s not what our policies would suggest that we should do in this case,\u201d he said.  Reuters reported last week that Zuckerberg told an all-staff meeting that Bannon had not violated enough of Facebook\u2019s policies to justify his suspension.  Blumenthal also noted that Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, which owns YouTube, had been given a \u201cpass\u201d from the hearing, saying that the company was being rewarded for its \u201ctimidity\u201d in content moderation.  Zuckerberg and Dorsey also fielded several pointed questions on whether they act as publishers, which the CEOs said they were not.  Upset over the companies\u2019 decision on what to leave on the platform and what to take down, many Republican lawmakers and Trump have threatened to take away protections for internet companies under a federal law called Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The law protects companies from being sued over material users post on their platforms.  Graham also said he hopes Section 230 is changed.  \u201cWhen you have companies that have the power of government, have far more power than traditional media outlets, something has to give,\u201d he said. President-elect Biden has also said he favors repealing Section 230. Congressional Democrats, however, prefer a more deliberate approach to reforming the law.  Zuckerberg and Dorsey said they would be open to some reforms to the law.  At an October hearing, Twitter\u2019s Dorsey said eroding Section 230 could significantly hurt how people communicate online. Zuckerberg said he supports changing the law but also said tech platforms were likely to censor more to avoid legal risks if the law is repealed.","634":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc and Twitter took action on posts from U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday for violating their rules against coronavirus misinformation by suggesting that COVID-19 was just like the flu.

His comments signal that U.S. Facebook users, many of them still angry over the company\u2019s admission that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica got hold of Facebook data on 50 million members, could find themselves in a worse position than Europeans.  The European law, called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is the biggest overhaul of online privacy since the birth of the internet, giving Europeans the right to know what data is stored on them and the right to have it deleted.  Apple Inc AAPL.O and some other tech firms have said they do plan to give people in the United States and elsewhere the same protections and rights that Europeans will gain.  Shares of Facebook closed up 0.5 percent on Tuesday at $156.11. They are down more than 15 percent since March 16, when the scandal broke over Cambridge Analytica.  FILE PHOTO: Facebook Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks on stage during the annual Facebook F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S., April 18, 2017. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam\/File Photo  PUSH FOR DATA PRIVACY  Privacy advocacy groups have been urging Facebook and its Silicon Valley competitors such as Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google to apply EU data laws worldwide, largely without success.  \u201cWe want Facebook and Google and all the other companies to immediately adopt in the United States and worldwide any new protections that they implement in Europe,\u201d said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, in Washington.  Zuckerberg said many of the tools that are part of the law, such as the ability of users to delete all their data, are already available for people on Facebook.  \u201cWe think that this is a good opportunity to take that moment across the rest of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThe vast majority of what is required here are things that we\u2019ve already had for years across the world for everyone.\u201d  Google and Facebook are the global leaders in internet ad revenue. Both based in California, they possess enormous amounts of data on billions of people.  Google has declined to comment on its plans.  When GDPR takes effect on May 25, people in EU countries will gain the right to transfer their data to other social networks, for example. Facebook and its competitors will also need to be much more specific about how they plan to use people\u2019s data, and they will need to get explicit consent.  GDPR is likely to hurt profit at Facebook because it could reduce the value of ads if the company cannot use personal information as freely and the added expense of hiring lawyers to ensure compliance with the new law.  Data is central to Facebook\u2019s advertising business, and it has not yet sketched out a satisfying plan for how it plans to comply, said Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser.  \u201cI haven\u2019t heard any solutions from Facebook to get ahead of the problem yet,\u201d Wieser said.  Failure to comply with the law carries a maximum penalty of up to 4 percent of annual revenue.  It should not be difficult for companies to extend EU practices and policies elsewhere because they already have systems in place, said Nicole Ozer, director of technology and civil liberties at the American Civil Liberties Union of California.  Companies\u2019 promises are less reassuring than laws, she said: \u201cIf user privacy is going to be properly protected, the law has to require it.\u201d","636":"Al menos dos publicaciones en Facebook compartieron un montaje fotogr\u00e1fico compuesto de varias im\u00e1genes de los supuestos precios de la gasolina en Estados Unidos cuando Barack Obama y Donald Trump fueron presidentes, subrayando que durante el mandato del republicano las tarifas del combustible habr\u00edan sido varias veces m\u00e1s bajas que cuando gobern\u00f3 el dem\u00f3crata.

La fotograf\u00eda con precios bajos de la gasolina es en realidad de la \u00e9poca en que el dem\u00f3crata estuvo en la Casa Blanca, y la que presenta tarifas altas a antes de su mandato.  SOBRE LOS PRECIOS DE LA GASOLINA  Las tarifas de los combustibles se ven afectadas por muchos factores. La Administraci\u00f3n de Informaci\u00f3n de Energ\u00eda de los Estados Unidos (EIA, por su sigla en ingl\u00e9s) los liga principalmente con el precio del crudo sin refinar y con la oferta y la demanda. \"Los precios mundiales del petr\u00f3leo crudo alcanzaron niveles r\u00e9cord en 2008 como resultado de la alta demanda mundial de petr\u00f3leo en relaci\u00f3n con la oferta\" (aqu\u00ed here ).  La menor demanda y la crisis financiera de 2008 (explicada con m\u00e1s detalle aqu\u00ed here y aqu\u00ed here ) llevaron a una ca\u00edda en los precios del gas (aqu\u00ed here ).  El medio de comunicaci\u00f3n The Atlantic inform\u00f3 en 2012 que el alza en los precios de la gasolina puede haber jugado un papel en la crisis global de hace 12 a\u00f1os (aqu\u00ed here ).  California es famosa por tener precios de la gasolina m\u00e1s altos debido a que hay menos fuentes de suministro que en otros estados. La EIA explica: \"Las refiner\u00edas de California deben funcionar casi a plena capacidad para satisfacer la demanda de gasolina del estado. Si m\u00e1s de una de sus refiner\u00edas experimenta problemas operativos al mismo tiempo, los precios de la gasolina de California pueden aumentar sustancialmente\" (aqu\u00ed here ).  Los precios de la gasolina en California han estado a niveles similares a los de las falsas publicaciones tanto en octubre de 2019, durante la gesti\u00f3n de Trump (aqu\u00ed here ) como en marzo de 2011 durante la de Obama (aqu\u00ed here ).  Se puede ver un gr\u00e1fico que muestra los precios de la gasolina en EE.

Los gr\u00e1ficos muestran una variaci\u00f3n n\u00edtida despu\u00e9s de un aumento en 2008.  En febrero de 2012, Obama achac\u00f3 las alzas de las tarifas del combustible a una combinaci\u00f3n de factores fuera de su control, incluidas las tensiones con Ir\u00e1n, la gran demanda de China, India y otras econom\u00edas emergentes, y los especuladores de Wall Street que se aprovechaban de la incertidumbre (aqu\u00ed here ).  VEREDICTO  Falso. Un montaje fotogr\u00e1fico que muestra altos precios de la gasolina es anterior a la administraci\u00f3n de Obama y otra con bajas tarifas es previa a que Trump se convirtiera en presidente. Si bien los precios de la gasolina alcanzaron promedios m\u00e1s altos durante el mandato de Obama (3,93) que en el de Trump (2,90), nunca llegaron a los 5 d\u00f3lares en promedio.

Slideshow ( 5 images )  The finance ministers of the five European Union member states said in a joint statement on Friday that stablecoins should not be allowed to operate in the 27-member bloc until legal, regulatory and oversight challenges had been addressed.  Stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency often backed by traditional assets, leapt onto policymakers' agendas last year when Facebook FB.O revealed plans for its Libra token.  Some central banks and financial regulators, concerned that Libra could destabilise monetary policy, facilitate money laundering and erode privacy, threatened to block it and the project has been delayed and reshaped as a result.  The EU\u2019s regulatory framework for stablecoins should preserve the bloc\u2019s monetary sovereignty and address risks to monetary policy, as well as protecting consumers, the five countries said in a statement issued on the sidelines of a broader meeting of European officials in Berlin.  The European Commission is expected to present its regulatory proposals later this month.  \u201cWe all agree that it\u2019s our task to keep financial market stable and to ensure that what is a task for states remains a task for states,\u201d German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told reporters during a joint statement with his counterparts.  \u2018VERY CLEAR RULES\u2019  Scholz said authorities should take a tough approach and this should include a ban on any private sector activities if regulatory requirements were not met.  The five countries want all stablecoins to be pledged at a ratio of 1:1 with fiat currency, with reserve assets denominated in the euro or other currencies of EU members states, and deposited in an EU-approved institution.  All entities operating as part of a stablecoin scheme should be registered in the EU, they said. Such a move would likely impact the Geneva-based Libra Association, which plans to issue and govern Libra.  The association declined to comment. It has previously said that it welcomed regulatory scrutiny.  \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for the Commission to issue very strong and very clear rules to avoid the misuse of cryptocurrencies for terrorist activities or for money laundering,\u201d French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said.  \u201cThe central bank, I mean the ECB, is the only one to be allowed to issue a currency. And this point, it\u2019s something that cannot be jeopardized or weakened by any kind of project including the so-called Libra project,\u201d Le Maire added.","638":"SYDNEY, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Australians woke to empty news feeds in their Facebook Inc accounts on Thursday after the social media giant blocked all local media content in a surprise and dramatic escalation of a dispute with the government over paying for content.

Lisa Davies, editor of daily The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper, owned by Nine Entertainment Co Ltd, tweeted: \u201cWell, that\u2019s a tantrum. Facebook has exponentially increased the opportunity for misinformation, dangerous radicalism and conspiracy theories to abound on its platform.\u201d  The Facebook pages of Nine, News Corp, and the government-funded Australian Broadcasting Corp, which acts as a central information source during natural disasters, were blank.

The Bureau of Meteorology, an official source for advice about bushfire danger, flooding and other natural disasters, was also scrubbed.  Facebook\u2019s drastic move comes ahead of the likely imposition of an Australia law that would require Big Tech firms, including Google, to reach commercial deals with Australian news outlets to use their content, or be subjected to forced arbitration.  Facebook said in its statement that the law \u201cfundamentally misunderstands\u201d the relationship between itself and publishers.

The machine learning tool rolled out over the last year identifies images that contain both nudity and a child, allowing increased enforcement of Facebook\u2019s ban on photos that show minors in a sexualized context.  A similar system also disclosed on Wednesday catches users engaged in \u201cgrooming,\u201d or befriending minors for sexual exploitation.  Facebook\u2019s global head of safety Antigone Davis told Reuters in an interview that the \u201cmachine helps us prioritize\u201d and \u201cmore efficiently queue\u201d problematic content for the company\u2019s trained team of reviewers.  The company is exploring applying the same technology to its Instagram app.  Under pressure from regulators and lawmakers, Facebook has vowed to speed up removal of extremist and illicit material. Machine learning programs that sift through the billions of pieces of content users post each day are essential to its plan.  Machine learning is imperfect, and news agencies and advertisers are among those that have complained this year about Facebook\u2019s automated systems wrongly blocking their posts.  Davis said the child safety systems would make mistakes but users could appeal.  \u201cWe\u2019d rather err on the side of caution with children,\u201d she said.  Facebook\u2019s rules for years have banned even family photos of lightly clothed children uploaded with \u201cgood intentions,\u201d concerned about how others might abuse such images.  Before the new software, Facebook relied on users or its adult nudity filters to catch child images. A separate system blocks child pornography that has previously been reported to authorities.  Facebook has not previously disclosed data on child nudity removals, though some would have been counted among the 21 million posts and comments it removed in the first quarter for sexual activity and adult nudity.  Facebook said the program, which learned from its collection of nude adult photos and clothed children photos, has led to more removals. It makes exceptions for art and history, such as the Pulitzer Prize-winning photo of a naked girl fleeing a Vietnam War napalm attack.  The child grooming system evaluates factors such as how many people have blocked a particular user and whether that user quickly attempts to contact many children, Davis said.  Michelle DeLaune, chief operating officer at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), said the organization expects to receive about 16 million child porn tips worldwide this year from Facebook and other tech companies, up from 10 million last year.  With the increase, NCMEC said it is working with Facebook to develop software to decide which tips to assess first.  Still, DeLaune acknowledged that a crucial blind spot is encrypted chat apps and secretive \u201cdark web\u201d sites where much of new child pornography originates.  Encryption of messages on Facebook-owned WhatsApp, for example, prevents machine learning from analyzing them.  DeLaune said NCMEC would educate tech companies and \u201chope they use creativity\u201d to address the issue.

After the stock market closed, Facebook disclosed as a part of its earnings report that the FTC told it last month that the commission had opened a separate antitrust investigation of the company. The FTC, which early in the day issued a statement and held a press conference about the privacy settlement, did not mention an antitrust probe.  The FTC probe that resulted in the $5 billion settlement uncovered a wide range of privacy issues. It was triggered last year by allegations that Facebook violated a 2012 consent decree by inappropriately sharing information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The consultancy\u2019s clients included President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign.  The FTC voted 3-2 to adopt the settlement, which the three Republican commissioners called the settlement \u201ca complete home run\u201d that exceeded any possible court award. Both Democratic commissioners said it did not go far enough or require a large enough fine. The settlement requires court approval.  Republican FTC Chairman Joe Simons stressed the FTC\u2019s limited authority and desire to avoid a long court fight.  \u201cWould it have been nice to get more, to get $10 billion, instead of $5 billion for example, to get greater restrictions on how Facebook collects uses and shares data?\u201d he asked at a press conference. \u201cWe did not have those options. We cannot impose such things by our own fiat.\u201d  Democratic FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra complained that the penalty provided \u201cblanket immunity\u201d for Facebook executives \u201cand no real restraints on Facebook\u2019s business model\u201d and does \u201cnot fix the core problems that led to these violations\u201d or limit Facebook\u2019s ability to collect data.  Facebook confirmed it would pay the $5 billion fine and said the settlement would provide \u201ca comprehensive new framework for protecting people\u2019s privacy.\u201d Its shares closed about 1% higher.  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said Facebook agreed to pay an additional $100 million to settle allegations that it misled investors about the seriousness of its misuse of users\u2019 data.  Slideshow ( 9 images )  Under the settlement, Facebook\u2019s board will create an independent privacy committee that removes \u201cunfettered control by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg over decisions affecting user privacy.\u201d  Facebook also agreed to exercise greater oversight over third-party apps, and said it was ending access to friend data for Microsoft Corp and Sony Corp.  The Republican FTC majority said the settlement \u201csignificantly diminishes Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s power -- something no government agency, anywhere in the world, has thus far accomplished.\u201d  Under the deal, Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives must sign quarterly certifications attesting to privacy practices. The FTC said a false certification could result in civil and criminal penalties.  Facebook also is barred from asking for email passwords to other services when consumers sign up. It is barred from using telephone numbers for advertising if they are obtained in a security feature like two-factor authentication. The company must also get user consent to use facial recognition data.  Facebook said it may find additional problems as it initiates a review of its systems and warned it will take longer to roll out updates.  In a Facebook post, Zuckerberg said\u201d \u201cwe\u2019re bringing our privacy controls more in line with our financial controls.\u201d He added that when features are added or modified, \u201cwe\u2019ll have to document any risks and the steps we\u2019re taking to mitigate them.\u201d  The FTC also said that Cambridge Analytica\u2019s former CEO Alexander Nix and former app developer Aleksandr Kogan had agreed to a settlement restricting how they conduct business.  Slideshow ( 9 images )  Several lawmakers criticized the settlement. Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called it \u201ca fig leaf\u201d that offers \u201cno accountability for top executives.\u201d  \u201cBy relying on a monetary fine to deter Facebook, the FTC has failed to heed history\u2019s lessons. Facebook has already written this penalty down as a one-time-cost in return for the extraordinary profits reaped from a decade of data misuse,\u201d said Blumenthal, a Democrat.  Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri also criticized the deal, saying it \u201cdoes nothing to hold executives accountable. It utterly fails to penalize Facebook in any effective way.\u201d  Facebook confirmed that marketing vice president Michel Protti had been nominated to be chief privacy officer for product but under the settlement he must be approved by the new board committee overseeing privacy.  Other legal issues loom. On Tuesday, the U.S. Justice Department said it was opening a broad investigation of major digital technology firms into whether they engage in anticompetitive practices. The department did not specify Facebook or any other company but cited concerns raised about \u201csearch, social media, and some retail services online.\u201d  Leaders in those areas include Google parent Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Facebook and possibly Apple Inc.  FTC DECIDED TO SETTLE PROBE  The Democrats on the FTC complained that the $5 billion penalty may be less than Facebook\u2019s gains from violating users\u2019 privacy. \u201cUntil we address Facebook\u2019s core financial incentives for risking our personal privacy and national security, we will not be able to prevent these problems from happening again,\u201d Chopra said.  The other Democratic commissioner, Rebecca Slaughter, said the FTC should have taken Facebook and Zuckerberg to court. She also criticized the FTC\u2019s decision to grant Facebook and its executives a release from liability for any claims that prior to June 12, 2019 it violated the earlier FTC settlement.  Slaughter said the FTC failed \u201cto impose any substantive restrictions on Facebook\u2019s collection and use of data from or about users.\u201d  Chopra said the settlement means \u201cthe commission -- and the public -- may never find out what Facebook knows... It is difficult to conclude that the commission got the better end of the bargain.\u201d","646":"(Corrects to remove extraneous word \u201cthe\u201d in 14th paragraph)  Jan 11 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc\u2019s operations chief Sheryl Sandberg said on Monday the world\u2019s largest social network had no plans to lift its block on the accounts of U.S. President Donald Trump, as the company clamped down on a phrase that has become a rallying cry for the president\u2019s supporters.  Sandberg, speaking during the Reuters Next conference, said she was glad that Facebook had frozen Trump\u2019s accounts, which came as tech giants scrambled to crack down on his baseless claims about fraud in the U.S. presidential election amid riots in Washington last week.  Hours later, the company banned the phrase \u201cstop the steal\u201d altogether, citing use of the term to organize events contesting the outcome of the U.S. presidential election that have a propensity for violence.

Facebook said Trump could not appeal the actual suspension through the board.  \u201cThis shows the president is not above the policies we have,\u201d Sandberg said, speaking with Reuters Breakingviews columnist Gina Chon.  Facebook executives have long taken a light touch to policing speech posted by politicians, maintaining that people have a right to see statements from their leaders.  The company backed down somewhat on that position and started applying labels to the president\u2019s posts after facing a backlash this summer, including an advertiser boycott, when it declined to act against Trump\u2019s incendiary rhetoric around anti-racism protests throughout the United States.  It reversed course and banned Trump indefinitely following last week\u2019s riots, which culminated in the storming of the U.S. Capitol.  Violent rhetoric on social media platforms including Facebook had ramped up in the weeks preceding the rallies as groups planned openly for the gatherings, according to researchers and public postings, prompting criticism of the companies for failing to take more aggressive action in advance.  Sandberg acknowledged that Facebook may have missed some of those posts but said she believed the events were largely organized on other platforms.  She said the company was keeping an eye on further possible armed protests being planned for Washington, D.C. and at all 50 U.S. state capital cities in the run-up to President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20, which has prompted an FBI warning.  Asked why Facebook had not taken comparable action against other leaders like Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and President Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, who likewise have been accused of inciting violence online, Sandberg said the company\u2019s policies would apply globally.  \u2018I\u2019M STAYING\u2019  Sandberg has played a less prominent public role at Facebook in the past year, even as CEO Mark Zuckerberg has thrown himself into the public sphere with a series of livestreamed chats and multiple sessions testifying before Congress.  The two have also faced questions about their future at Facebook following the mid-year return of Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, who had left the year prior citing vague differences over the company\u2019s direction.  Asked about the future for herself and Zuckerberg at Facebook, Sandberg said both were staying put in their current roles.  \u201cI\u2019m staying,\u201d she said, adding that she and Zuckerberg \u201cfeel we have a real responsibility to fix the systems that didn\u2019t work before to protect our service and to make sure great things can happen,\u201d Sandberg added.  Sandberg also denied reports that she had been sidelined as Zuckerberg took a more active role in content policy and government relations, her traditional areas of responsibility.  \u201cPeople love headlines about corporate drama, and I think it\u2019s fair to say they particularly love headlines about sidelining women. But I just feel tremendously lucky to have this job because there is so much good,\u201d she said.  Sandberg said regulatory pressure on U.S. tech companies around antitrust issues was \u201cvery real,\u201d cautioning similar scrutiny two decades ago was a \u201cmajor distraction\u201d for Microsoft Corp and caused it to miss the next phase of technology development.  \u201cWe know that history, and we have to both work on these serious issues, work with the government, work on reforming the rules that govern us - which need to be reformed - and keep innovating,\u201d she said.  --- For more coverage from the Reuters Next conference, please click here here or .

A Facebook ad is pictured in Times Square in New York, New York, U.S. October 9, 2019. REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri  \u201cI just heard there\u2019s supposed to be a mass shooting tonight at the fireworks,\u201d the woman, whose name is held to protect her privacy, said in a post in a private Facebook Group with over 5,000 members. \u201cProbably just a rumor or kids trying to scare people, but everyone keep their eyes open,\u201d she said in the post, which was later deleted.  There was no shooting at the Blueberry Festival that night, and the local police said there was no threat.  But the post sparked fear in the community, with some group members canceling their plans to attend, and shows the power of rumors in Facebook Groups, which are often private or closed to outsiders. Groups allow community members to quickly spread information, and possibly misinformation, to users who trust the word of their neighbors.  These groups and other private features, rather than public feeds, are \"the future\" of social media, Facebook Inc FB.O Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in April, revealing their importance to Facebook's business model.  The threat of misinformation spreading rapidly in Groups shows a potential vulnerability in a key part of the company\u2019s growth strategy. It could push Facebook to invest in expensive human content monitoring at the risk of limiting the ability to post in real time, a central benefit of Groups and Facebook in general that has attracted millions of users to the platform.  When asked if Facebook takes accountability for situations like the one in Indiana, a company spokeswoman said it is committed to maintaining groups as a safe place, and that it encourages people to contact law enforcement if they see a potential threat.  Facebook Groups can also serve as a tool for connecting social communities around the world, such as ethnic groups, university alumni and hobbyists.  Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp messaging platform faced similar but more serious problems in 2018 after false messages about child abductors led to mass beatings of more than a dozen people in India, some of whom have died. WhatsApp later limited message forwards and began labeling forwarded messages to quell the risk of fake news.  FIREWORKS FEAR  The Blueberry Festival post caused chaos in the group, named \u201cLocal News Now 2...(Marshall and all surrounding Counties).\u201d  In another post, which garnered over 100 comments of confusion and worry, a different member urged the woman to report the threat to the police. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something to joke about or take lightly,\u201d she wrote.  The author of the original post did not respond to repeated requests for comment.  Facebook\u2019s policy is to remove language that \u201cincites or facilitates serious violence,\u201d the company spokeswoman said, adding that it did not remove the post and that it did not violate Facebook\u2019s policies because there \u201cwas no threat, praise or support of violence.\u201d  Cheryl Siddall, the founder of the Indiana group, said she would welcome tools from Facebook to give her greater \u201ccontrol\u201d over what people post in the group, such as alerts to page moderators if posts contain certain words or phrases.  But Siddall said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s a full-time job to sit and monitor everything that\u2019s going on in the page.\u201d  A Facebook spokeswoman said page administrators have the ability to remove a post if it violates the group\u2019s proprietary rules and that administrators can pre-approve individual posts, as well as turn on post approvals for individual group members.  In a post to its blog, Facebook urged administrators to write \u201cgreat group rules\u201d to \u201cset the tone for your group and help prevent member conflict,\u201d as well as \u201cprovide a feeling of safety for group members.\u201d  David Bacon, chief of police for the Plymouth Police Department in Marshall County, said the threat was investigated and traced back to an exaggerated rumor from children. Nonetheless, he said the post to the Facebook group is \u201cwhat caused the whole problem.\u201d  \u201cOne post grows and people see it, and they take it as the gospel, when in actuality you can throw anything you want out there,\u201d Bacon said.","649":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  LONDON (Reuters) - Facebook and eBay have promised to better identify, probe and respond to fake and misleading reviews, Britain\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Wednesday after pressing the online platforms to tackle the issue.

Cross-border tax rules are set to be rewritten after 137 states sought last month to avoid a new trade war over the global multiplication of taxes on digital services, prompted by some countries preparing to go it alone.  \u201cI understand that there\u2019s frustration about how tech companies are taxed in Europe. We also want tax reform and I\u2019m glad the OECD is looking at this,\u201d Zuckerberg is expected to tell the Munich Security Conference.  \u201cWe want the OECD process to succeed so that we have a stable and reliable system going forward. And we accept that may mean we have to pay more tax and pay it in different places under a new framework,\u201d he added.  Amazon AMZN.O, Facebook and Google GOOGL.O have strained existing rules because they are able to book profits in low-tax countries like Ireland, no matter where their customers are.  Government officials agreed last month to negotiate new rules for where tax should be paid and what share of profit should be taxed, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said.  EUROPEAN VISIT  A growing number of countries are preparing national digital taxes in the absence of a major redrafting of the rules, despite Washington\u2019s threat of retaliatory trade tariffs because it sees such levies as discriminatory against big U.S tech groups.  Zuckerberg\u2019s speech excerpts gave no further details on tax rates. Facebook says it pays all the tax it should and that this has averaged more than 20% over the last five years.

Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Klobuchar. But Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told reporters that he ended the company\u2019s relationship with the outside firm, Definers Public Affairs, after he became aware of it while reading the New York Times story. Definers did not respond to a request to comment.

It could also have other legal ramifications.\u201d  If Facebook spent money trying to influence the outcome of an election, it would have been required to disclose that spending to the Federal Election Commission and failure to do so would be a violation of the law. However, recent Supreme Court rulings have given companies leeway, requiring that they directly call for someone to be elected, or lose their office, to trigger the campaign finance laws.  The Times report said Facebook hired the Republican firm to discredit activist protesters and lobbied a Jewish civil rights group to cast some critics of the company as anti-Semitic.  Its issue with Klobuchar involved legislation known as the Honest Ads Act, which she has supported along with Democratic Senator Mark Warner and the late Arizona Republican Senator John McCain.

It said its review had shown healthcare workers who took hydroxychloroquine were less likely to contract COVID-19 (here) .

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  It has been just over a year since Facebook\u2019s improper data sharing with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica launched probes on both sides of the Atlantic. That included a U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigation into whether Facebook violated a 2011 agreement over user privacy.  Some companies pulled their ads off the social network and users tweeted #DeleteFacebook as they shut down their accounts. And investors knocked nearly $70 billion off Facebook\u2019s market value in less than a month as executives admitted costs of fending off outright regulation would spiral.  But Facebook is now worth $40 billion more than it was right before the scandal erupted. Shares surged 6 percent on Thursday, the day after it disclosed a $3 billion litigation accrual in quarterly earnings that otherwise beat estimates.  \u201cWith each fresh scandal, commentators and politicians demand vague action and declare the end is nigh,\u201d said Ben Marder, senior lecturer in marketing at the University of Edinburgh Business School.  \u201cAll this just solidifies Facebook as a shining example of \u2018whatever doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger\u2019. Figures show its users are generally happier now, following alterations to the algorithm to give them more \u2018meaningful content\u2019.  Facebook\u2019s namesake app logged an 8 percent rise in users from the first quarter last year. The company raised its 2019 expense forecast, but the financial penalty itself prompted few concerns.  There were some worries from analysts about changes the FTC could potentially force as part of a settlement, however, and how new requirements might hurt ad targeting and revenue.  Facebook founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg in March said he was open to government oversight of social media, and in a blog post said Facebook\u2019s future is in private messaging. The company is also working on a WhatsApp-based payments system.  Analysts appear to buy into Facebook\u2019s vision, though it has not articulated how it will adapt its ad model. In the meantime, they said advertisers will still be drawn by its massive user base.  \u201cWhile marketers may say privately that they do worry about Facebook\u2019s problems with fake news, election meddling, privacy and more, they worry more about their own financial health, and Facebook is still a major partner in that regard,\u201d eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson said.  Facebook is also a global and diversified company. Its U.S. users have held relatively steady in recent quarters, but overseas markets fuel growth.  The company has said its Instagram app now has more than a billion users, versus Facebook\u2019s 2.38 billion. There are also an estimated billion people on Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger.  One analyst characterized Facebook as a Swiss army knife with ad products that can now meet almost any advertising need. Industry estimates show only 25 percent to 30 percent of global advertising has migrated online  \u201cAlong with Google, we expect Facebook to be a primary beneficiary of the about $600 billion global advertising industry\u2019s secular shift from offline to online,\u201d Baird Equity analysts said  FTC REMEDIES?  Of course, regulatory risks remain and more bad headlines could turn off users, analysts said. Facebook has also grappled with scrutiny over how the platform was being used to promote extremism and spread misinformation.  There are also worries revenue from targeted ads could slow.  A settlement with the FTC could include remedies for the company that force it to change its business practices, privacy experts said. The FTC might require Facebook to collect less of the user data that it needs to target advertisements, for example.  David Vladeck, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection at the time of the 2011 consent agreement, said Facebook should be required to make sure its users agree to any data collection by third parties.  Having less data could knock two percent off overall revenue since Facebook would know less about its users and advertisers would pay less, Gene Munster of Loup Ventures estimated. Facebook had $55.8 billion in revenue last year  The company has set aside $3 billion to cover a settlement with U.S. regulators and warned that could rise to $5 billion. That would be largest civil penalty ever paid to the FTC.  Facebook generated more than $5 billion in free cash in the quarter and ended with $45 billion in cash. Revenue in the first quarter rose around to $15.1 billion, growing by roughly the size of the accrual.","663":"PARIS, July 17 (Reuters) - G7 ministers meeting in France on Wednesday agreed on the need to confront the emergence of digital currencies following Facebook\u2019s plans to launch its Libra digital coin, a French G7 presidency source said on Wednesday.

Zuckerberg on Wednesday promised tougher steps to restrict developers\u2019 access to user information, his first response to allegations that consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed data to build profiles on American voters it used in the 2016 presidential election.  Analysts from several brokerages expressed relief that there were no signs in Zuckerberg\u2019s first public comments on the row of a more fundamental shift in the company\u2019s revenue model.  Facebook shares, however, have fallen for two of the last three days, knocking nearly $46 billion off its market value, and some analysts said it was clear the company would have to carry extra costs to shore up its reputation in the months ahead.  \u201cWe expect more cautious FB investors to point to the potential for FB to spend more this year due to these increased safeguards...which will hold back earnings power,\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s Brian Nowak said in a morning note.

FILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is displayed on a smartphone in this illustration taken January 6, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo  A Facebook representative told Reuters on Tuesday it had given the Independent Investigative Mechanism on Myanmar (IIMM) data from pages and accounts associated with the Myanmar military that it had removed in 2018 to stop hate speech against Rohingya but declined to describe the content.  \u201cAs these investigations proceed, we will continue to coordinate with them to provide relevant information as they investigate international crimes in Myanmar,\u201d the representative said.  Myanmar is facing charges of genocide at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over a 2017 military crackdown on the Rohingya that forced 730,000 people to flee into Bangladesh.  Myanmar denies genocide and says its forces were conducting legitimate operations against militants who attacked police posts.  The U.N. Human Rights Council set up the IIMM in 2018 to collect evidence of international crimes in Myanmar.  U.N investigators said Facebook had played a key role in spreading hate speech that fuelled the violence. In 2018, the company said it had removed 18 accounts and 52 pages associated with the Myanmar military, including the page of its commander-in-chief, but preserved the data.  The head of the IIMM told Reuters this month that Facebook has not released evidence of \u201cserious international crimes\u201d with the body, despite vowing to cooperate.  He confirmed on Tuesday the body had received a \u201cfirst data set which partially complies with our previous requests\u201d.  \u201cI am hopeful it signifies a further step forward towards a cooperative relationship that will allow us access to important relevant evidence of serious international crimes,\u201d he told Reuters in an email.  Facebook this month blocked a bid by Gambia, which brought the genocide case against Myanmar at the ICJ, to obtain posts and communications by members of Myanmar\u2019s military and police.","667":"SAN FRANCISCO\/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Google retains only a slight lead over Facebook in the competition for digital ad dollars in the crucial India market, sources familiar with the figures say, even though the search giant has been in the country far longer and has avoided the controversies that have dogged its rival.  Facebook\u2019s success has shaken Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, led by an Indian-born CEO, Sundar Pichai, who has made developing markets a priority.  Google officials in India earlier this year were alarmed to learn that Facebook Inc was likely to generate about $980 million in revenue in the country in 2018, according to one of the sources. Google\u2019s India revenues reached $1 billion only last year.  Facebook and Google declined to comment on Indian revenue figures or the competition between the two companies.  Google is now pushing back, attempting to lure customers with better ad-buying tools and more localized services. The revamped strategy mirrors initiatives that have succeeded in boosting the time Indian consumers spend with Google services.  The battle in India reflects an epic challenge for Google in developing markets around the world that are crucial to the company\u2019s long-term growth - many consumers in those country\u2019s are gravitating to Facebook and it\u2019s siblings, Instagram and WhatsApp, at the expense of Google search and YouTube, and advertising dollars are quick to follow.  \u201cFacebook is a far more user-friendly platform even though they haven\u2019t created features specifically for Indian advertisers,\u201d said Vikas Chawla, who runs a small ad-buying agency in India.  Facebook ads, compared with those on Google search or YouTube, tend to transcend language barriers more easily because they rely more on visual elements, said Narayan Murthy Ivaturi, vice president at FreakOut Pte Ltd, a Singapore-headquartered digital marketing firm. Pinpointing younger consumers and rural populations is easier with Facebook and its Instagram app, he and other ad buyers said.  And Facebook is succeeding in India, which boasts the fastest-growing digital ad market of any major economy, despite internal turmoil and political controversy. It has been without a country head for the last year, and has faced a series of incidents in which rumors circulating on Facebook and WhatsApp have prompted mob violence.  A woman walks past the logo of Google during an event in New Delhi, India, August 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Adnan Abidi  Facebook and Google between them took 68 percent of India\u2019s digital ad market last year, according to advertising buyer Magna. Media agency GroupM estimates digital advertising spending will grow 30 percent in India this year.  The Facebook phenomenon is evident close to home for Google. During a recent lunch period, six out of 10 people who walked out of Google\u2019s Bangalore offices while looking at their phones told Reuters they were checking WhatsApp. All 10 said they regularly used Whatsapp.  Eight Indian ad buyers interviewed by Reuters were divided on whether Facebook would overtake Google in Indian ad revenue. That such a question would even be debated explains why Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, has pressed to flip the company\u2019s approach to emerging markets.  \u201cIndia is the most important market for the \u2018Next Billion Users\u2019 initiative,\u201d Caesar Sengupta, the head of the effort, told Reuters on the sidelines of the annual \u201cGoogle for India\u201d event in New Delhi last week.  NEW TACTICS  For many years Google designed its services for early adopters of new technology, who tended to be in Silicon Valley, said Nelson Mattos, who oversaw Google\u2019s Europe and Africa operations for several years. Great products would then find a broad global audience.  \u201cOver time, as you saw the growth of Facebook, the importance of WhatsApp and other tools in these new markets, and not the same adoption of Google, the company started to realize that maybe they had to change that approach,\u201d Mattos said.  Shortly after taking the helm three years ago, Pichai mapped a new strategy for places such as India: More services tailored to locals; more marketing on radio, billboards and TV; more local staff and start-up investment.  Google\u2019s India workforce has more than doubled since to more than 4,000 employees, or about eight times Facebook\u2019s presence, according to a tally of LinkedIn profiles and company statements.  Its products evolved too, becoming easier to use with low data plans. Smartphone apps such as Files Go and Tez - rebranded last week as Google Pay - were aimed at Indians.  \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a sea change,\u201d said Asif Baki, a user researcher at Google who oversees two-week \u201cimmersion trips\u201d in developing markets for senior executives and staff.  The efforts are bearing fruit. Indian users during the first half of this year spent more time on Google services than on Facebook services, according to estimates from audience measurement firm Comscore. Over a similar period a year ago, Facebook came out on top.  Extending those gains to the ad business is a work in progress. A handful of Google executives, including leaders for display ads and small business advertisers, traveled to India earlier this year in a previously unreported trip to better understand the needs of Indian clients.  The visit spurred them to consider ideas such as enabling advertisers to reach users only in a particular Indian state, since language and literacy vary greatly around the country, according to a person familiar with the discussions.  At the New Delhi event, Google unveiled a plan to bring Indian newspaper content online, to increase the supply of search results - and ads - available in regional languages.  Google still has to reckon with other issues. Small businesses in emerging markets are less likely to have websites, a foundation for Google ad campaigns but unnecessary for Facebook.  Executives met with one Indian merchant who recorded product videos on YouTube then messaged the links to potential customers on WhatsApp, said Kim Spalding, the company\u2019s general manager and product lead for small business ads.  Facebook, meanwhile, is already on to commercializing such behavior. Just weeks ago, it began charging for text-based marketing features on WhatsApp, with video ads expected to launch next year.","668":"FILE PHOTO: Adam Mosseri, Vice President of Product Management for Facebook, speaks during 2016 TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco, California, U.S. September 14, 2016.

The WhatsApp messaging application is seen on a phone screen August 3, 2017. REUTERS\/Thomas White\/Files  WhatsApp said in a statement it was working with local startup Proto to classify messages sent to the service by users as true, false, misleading or disputed. They will also build a database of such content to better understand misinformation.  The move comes as WhatsApp, with over 200 million users in India, battles criticism of its platform being used for the spread of misinformation, while social media companies across the board work to prevent the phenomenon - particularly during sensitive events such as elections.  WhatsApp owner Facebook Inc said on Monday it had deleted 712 accounts and 390 pages in India and Pakistan for \u201cinauthentic behaviour\u201d, saying many were linked to India\u2019s opposition Congress party and others related to Pakistan\u2019s military.  The first phase of India\u2019s elections are scheduled to begin on April 11, with final results expected on May 23.  Major Indian political parties have accused each other of propagating fake news on WhatsApp while denying they do so themselves. In February, a senior WhatsApp executive said parties were trying to use the app in \u201cways for which it was not intended\u201d.  WhatsApp had a similar challenge during Brazilian elections last year, when politicians had faced claims of spreading falsehoods on the platform.  \u201cThe goal of this project is to study the misinformation phenomenon at scale,\u201d Proto\u2019s founders Ritvvij Parrikh and Nasr ul Hadi said in a statement. \u201cAs more data flows in, we will be able to identify the most susceptible or affected issues, locations, languages, regions, and more.\u201d  WhatsApp said Proto would be helped by two other organisations with experience working on misinformation-related projects.  \u201cThe challenge of viral misinformation requires more collaborative efforts and cannot be solved by any one organisation alone,\u201d WhatsApp said.  The new service, dubbed Checkpoint Tipline, can receive messages in the form of images and video as well as text in English and four regional languages, it added. Checkpoint is a research project commissioned by WhatsApp.  Reuters received a message on WhatsApp containing false information and forwarded it to the service around 0640 GMT. It was still awaiting classification more than two hours later.  \u201cThank you, we\u2019ve received your request and you should hear from us again shortly,\u201d a reply said.  WhatsApp\u2019s end-to-end encryption allows groups of many users to exchange text messages, images and video beyond the oversight of independent fact checkers or even the company itself.  In July, the company introduced a measure limiting the number of messages a user can forward, a move aimed at curbing mass forwards in India, where the spread of rumours led to several killings and sparked calls for government action.","671":"DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Facebook\u2019s operations chief said the world\u2019s largest social network needed to earn back public trust and was investing billions of dollars a year to improve the security of its network.

Reuters Fact Check. REUTERS  Posts making this claim can be found here , here , and here .  On July 27, 2020, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency announced ( here ) that officers at O\u2019Hare\u2019s International Mail Facility (IMF) had seized 19,888 counterfeit licenses between January and June. The press release stated that most had come from China and Hong Kong, as well as Great Britain and South Korea, and that they were largely for students.  \u201cThese fraudulent identity documents can lead to identity theft, worksite enforcement, critical infrastructure protection, fraud linked to immigration-related crimes such as human smuggling and human trafficking, and these documents can be used by those individuals associated with terrorism to minimize scrutiny from travel screening measures,\u201d the CBP release said.  Fox 5 New York also reported on the seizure ( here ).  Though neither the CBP nor Fox 5 New York mentioned voter fraud, an opinion piece was published on Aug. 9 on the website of conservative author and podcaster David Harris, Jr., with the headline, \u201cPotential Voter Fraud Anyone? Shipments Of Nearly 20,000 Fake Driver\u2019s Licenses Seized At Chicago Airport In 2020!\u201d ( here ).  On Aug. 11, CBS affiliate WUSA9 debunked the blog post\u2019s link between the false licenses and voter fraud ( here ). WUSA9 said that \"While tens of thousands of fake IDs were seized at Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport since the start of the year, the only place linking them to a voter fraud operation is the article in question.\u201d  On Sept. 6, a website called \u201cChannel411News.com\u201d posted an article with the headline \u201cFeds Seize 19,888 Fake State Driver Licenses (Made in China) in Chicago O\u2019Hare Airport \u2013 ALL Registered to Vote \u2014 ALL Democrat\u201d ( here ). This version of the claim has since been shared widely by Facebook users, some of whom have included the link ( here ).  The notion that fraudulent licenses could be used to impersonate other voters or vote more than once at Illinois polling stations is weakened by the fact the state does not have voter identification requirements under normal circumstances ( here , here ). Matt Dietrich, a spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections ( www.elections.il.gov\/ ), explained to Reuters via email that it is the voter\u2019s signature, rather than photo ID, that is checked to verify identification at the polls.  Though Illinois voters do not declare a party affiliation when they register to vote, Dietrich said that a voter\u2019s party affiliation, if they participate in primaries, \u201ccan be inferred based on the party ballot the voter chose at the most recent primary election, but there is nothing in the registration system that attaches a party affiliation to a voter\u2019s name or voter ID.\u201d In order to determine whether the intended recipients of the fraudulent licenses were \u201call Democrats,\u201d as the posts claim, Dietrich said that \u201cyou\u2019d have to look up every individual\u2019s voting record and determine whether they took a Democratic or Republican ballot at the last primary they voted in.\u201d That would also assume they all voted in primaries.  As for voter registration, fraudsters would need a valid Illinois driver\u2019s license in order to use the state board of elections\u2019 online voter registration portal ( ova.elections.il.gov\/ ). Dietrich explained that the driver\u2019s license is necessary because the registrant\u2019s signature is captured from the license record. But you would also need other personally identifiable information.  For in-person registration, a valid driver\u2019s license can be one of the two required forms of ID. An applicant would need an additional form of identification, such as a utility bill or other mail sent to the voter\u2019s address.  \u201cBut local election authorities also check Social Security numbers on applications, so a fake driver\u2019s license number that doesn\u2019t match up with a record at the Secretary of State\u2019s Office would raise a red flag,\u201d Dietrich said.  Essentially, the holders of these fraudulent licenses would have to know the voters\u2019 address, or valid license number on record to potentially get through. Even in this unlikely scenario, there\u2019s no evidence, per authorities\u2019 reports, that licenses seized at O\u2019Hare were intended for election fraud or for \u201cDemocrats\u201d as the posts claim.  John Mirkovic, deputy clerk for Cook County, Illinois ( here ), told Reuters via email that \u201cthe CBP has confirmed that these IDs are counterfeit, and that they have no evidence of voter fraud in relation to these shipments, and we have not received any information suggesting otherwise.\u201d  Explaining the signature verification system used for voter registration in Illinois, Mirkovic explained that \u201ca false identity would not help someone falsely register, even if their actual photo were on it.\u201d  \u201cFortunately for voters, our systems are more sophisticated than something that might fool a bouncer at a bar,\u201d he said.  The Reuters Fact Check team previously reported on social media posts oversimplifying voter fraud ( here ). The unlikely scenario of voter fraud faces many obstacles, including being a criminal offense.  VERDICT  Partly false. While it is true that U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents seized nearly 20,000 fake drivers\u2019 licenses at Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport in July, there is no connection between the licenses and alleged voter fraud efforts.

The messaging service said in January it would limit the number of times a user could forward a message to five in a bid to fight \u201cmisinformation and rumors.\u201d  Concerns about Facebook\u2019s handling of personal information have grown since the world\u2019s largest social network admitted in March that data of millions of users was wrongly harvested by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.  In a blog post, WhatsApp said a user inviting another to a group will be prompted to send a private invite through an individual chat, giving the recipient the choice of joining the group. The request will expire in three days.  Facebook, when asked about the default setting in the privacy option, said the default is \u201ceveryone\u201d.  The setting will be rolled out on Wednesday for some users and be available worldwide in the coming weeks.  WhatsApp, seen as a key tool for communications and commerce in many countries, was acquired by Facebook in 2014 for $19 billion.","675":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click LIVE\/ or type LIVE\/ in a news window)  * Energy stocks gain on higher oil prices  * Dow set for worst first quarter ever  * Carnival slumps on plan to raise debt, suspend dividend  * Indexes up: Dow 0.18%, S&P 0.02%, Nasdaq 0.66% (Updates to open, adds comment)  March 31 (Reuters) - U.S. stock markets steadied on Tuesday at the end of the worst first quarter for the S&P 500 since 1938 amid growing evidence of the largescale damage caused by the collapse in oil prices and business activity due to the coronavirus.  Real estate stocks, utilities and consumer staples - commonly considered defensives - led declines following a rebound sparked by bargain hunters looking for stocks likely to weather an economic slump.  Another set of gains for Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc , Apple, Netflix Inc and Google-parent Alphabet Inc, known as the FAANG group of stocks, helped the Nasdaq jump 1% on Tuesday.  \u201cStocks have been on a wild ride ... (and) not surprisingly, investors are split on whether to lean in to or fade the current rally,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse Securities in New York.  An unprecedented round of fiscal and monetary stimulus had helped equity markets stabilize last week following wild swings that sent the benchmark S&P 500 up 9% one day only to slump 12% in the next session.  Wall Street\u2019s volatility index has retreated from 12-year highs, but is still at levels rarely seen since the global financial crisis as the outbreak deepens in the United States and disrupts supply chains.  Sliding from the record highs of mid February, the Dow Jones and S&P 500 indexes are now set to end the quarter more than 18% lower from the start of the year.  The declines have erased more than $5 trillion from the value of S&P 500 firms in the first quarter, and investors fear corporate defaults and more mass layoffs going in to the second quarter.  The blue-chip Dow is on course for its biggest quarterly percentage decline since 1987 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq is set to close out its worst first three months of the year since 2008.  \u201cWhile the majority of people want to remain optimistic that we\u2019ve seen the lows ... that optimism is merely based on a lot of hope,\u201d said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.  At 10:17 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 39.30 points, or 0.18%, at 22,366.78, the S&P 500 was up 0.54 points, or 0.02%, at 2,627.19. The Nasdaq Composite was up 51.60 points, or 0.66%, at 7,825.75.  Shares of Carnival Corp, already by hammered by plunging global travel demand, tumbled 12% after it said it was raising about $6 billion in combination debt and equity and suspend its dividend payouts.  The energy index jumped 4%, boosted by a rebound in prices from 18-year lows after the United States and Russia agreed to discuss stabilizing energy markets.  Advancing issues almost matched decliners on the NYSE and on the Nasdaq.  The S&P index recorded one new 52-week high and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded seven new highs and 13 new lows.

Facebook has drawn heat for its relatively hands-off approach to political speech, particularly its policy of exempting politicians\u2019 posts from fact-checking.  It does maintain more stringent rules for outside groups like PACs, and earlier this month banned a Republican PAC from advertising after it repeatedly shared content that was deemed false by external fact-checkers.  (Reuters is one of Facebook\u2019s fact-checking partners.)  Facebook also draws some lines for politicians, barring content that, for example, incites violence. In June, it removed Trump re-election campaign posts showing a red inverted triangle, a symbol used by the Nazis, for violating its policy against organized hate.  Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said only certain versions of the Priorities USA ad had been blocked, which he called \u201ca mistake - an embarrassing one, actually,\u201d while other versions were allowed to run.

REUTERS\/Leah Millis  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - U.S. lawmakers are zeroing in on the correct Facebook target. Whether they pull the trigger is another matter.  Senators on Tuesday grilled Chairman and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg during his first congressional hearing on the company\u2019s data practices. Politicians often chew the scenery with long-winded, self-serving wind-ups, but Zuckerberg was peppered with some fairly pointed questions that got to the heart of the issue.  Facebook\u2019s business model depends almost entirely on advertising. In exchange for allowing consumers to use the social network for free, it mines information to sell to brands.  The committee members grasped that Facebook is getting the better end of the deal. Confusing terms of service written in hard-to-understand language obscure the true nature of the agreement. Facebook may provide tools that let members access all their information and control who they share it with, yet effectively deploying them is not an easy task.  Even the Facebook founder acknowledged that the average person doesn\u2019t understand the terms of service or read them. But he effectively defended the status quo, saying few would bother to read a more detailed description of the terms.  He was dodgy on the question of whether Facebook would embrace Europe\u2019s new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR as it\u2019s known, more broadly. In May, social networks like Facebook will be required to get specific consent from people to use their data. Facebook has said it intends to adopt these policies elsewhere, including in the United States, but has been cagey about how it would actually do so.  Senator Lindsey Graham posed the big question when he asked the 33-year-old founder why Facebook should be allowed to regulate itself. Zuckerberg said he would be open to \u201cthe right regulation,\u201d and both sides were content to leave the matter there. That may explain why Facebook stock rose during the hearing to end the day with a gain of more than 4 percent.  Such forbearance may not be sustainable, though. As long as the $450 billion company\u2019s ad-driven business conflicts with users\u2019 privacy interests, it can\u2019t be trusted to police itself.","678":"FILE PHOTO: The Facebook logo is displayed on a mobile phone in this picture illustration taken December 2, 2019.

A WhatsApp advertisement is seen on the front pages of newspapers at a stall in Mumbai, India, January 13, 2021. Picture taken January 13, 2021. REUTERS\/Francis Mascarenhas  Though WhatsApp has yet to see mass uninstalls of its app in India, users concerned about privacy are increasingly downloading rival apps such as Signal and Telegram, research firms say, propelling them higher on the download charts and putting those apps ahead of their ubiquitous rival in India for the first time.  The reaction in India - where 400 million users exchange more messages on WhatsApp than anywhere in the world - has forced the messaging app to unleash an advertising blitz costing tens of millions of rupees this week in at least 10 English and Hindi newspapers.  \u201cRespect for your privacy is coded into our DNA,\u201d WhatsApp said in one newspaper announcement.  It said its privacy policy update \u201cdoes not affect the privacy of your messages with your friends and family in any way\u201d. WhatsApp has also said that the changes to the privacy policy are only related to users\u2019 interactions with businesses.  When asked for comment, WhatsApp referred Reuters to its published statements on privacy.  The media campaign - similar to one it ran two years ago when it was facing criticism in India for not doing enough to curb disinformation - underscores the severity of the crisis for the world\u2019s most popular messaging platform.  Parent Facebook and WhatsApp have bet big on India and any user grumbling could dent their plans.  Last year, Facebook invested $5.7 billion in the digital unit of Indian oil-to-tech group Reliance - the social media giant\u2019s biggest deal since its $22 billion buyout of WhatsApp in 2014.  A huge part of the India investment hinges on a WhatsApp and Reliance project to allow about 30 million mum-and-pop store owners to transact digitally.  While WhatsApp\u2019s payment service, approved by India\u2019s flagship payments processor late last year after two years of waiting, does not fall under the privacy policy update, any sizeable user shift to other messengers could mean losing out to well-entrenched rivals.  CONCERNS ABOUND  Users around the world were alarmed when WhatsApp said on Jan. 4 it reserved the right to share some user data including location and phone number, with Facebook and its units such as Instagram and Messenger.  Even as WhatsApp sought to calm fears and assure users that neither it nor Facebook would have access to their messages, calls, or call logs, the privacy policy update triggered a storm globally with Signal downloads swelling as people looked for alternative messengers.  Signal was the most downloaded free app in India on both Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android outpacing WhatsApp, according to internet research firm Top10VPN.  Downloads of Signal in India jumped to 7,100,000 between Jan. 5 and Jan. 12, from about 15,000 days earlier, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower. Telegram downloads surged 40% while WhatsApp downloads fell 30% in the period.  Manish Khatri, a Mumbai based smartphone seller, said many of his customers were asking if WhatsApp could read their messages.  Indian startups have also been quick to react.  \u201cHere in India WhatsApp\/Facebook are abusing their monopoly and taking away millions of users\u2019 privacy for granted,\u201d Vijay Shekhar Sharma, chief executive of Alibaba-backed fintech Paytm, said on Twitter.  \u201cWe should move on to @signalapp NOW.

REUTERS\/Aaron Bernstein  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook have been inseparable since he launched the social network 15 years ago. But his lack of perspective helped create the existential problems facing the company today. His priority is finding a new leader who can take over and meet the challenge.  The company has been reeling since the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, when Zuckerberg brushed off alarm bells that Kremlin-backed operatives manipulated the platform to sway voters. Worries about fake news and privacy violations have prompted users to abandon the network and politicians to demand regulation. Surmounting the crisis will require a new business model, just as Facebook\u2019s valuation looks over the hill.  The company harvests data from more than 2 billion members and pitches it to advertisers so they can target their messages. Promoting controversial and divisive content while making it difficult for users to control their personal information is part of the money machine. Facebook either properly cleans up to avoid losing more users or it will have to hunt for different revenue streams.  The company has faced setbacks before. Shortly after it went public in 2012, it lost about half of its then $25 billion market value on fears it wouldn\u2019t be able to move advertising to mobile phones from desktop computers. Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg overcame that challenge, but they didn\u2019t change the basic model. What they did do was double costs.  Assume the same happens in 2019 and operating expenses rise to $50 billion. Meanwhile, revenue growth slows to 24 percent, according to the mean analyst estimate from Refinitiv\u2019s I\/B\/E\/S, hitting $68 billion. Tax the profit at the standard corporate rate to arrive at $15 billion. On Facebook\u2019s current multiple of 17 times earnings, it would be worth about $260 billion - roughly a third less than its value at the end of November.  To survive and thrive, the company must do more than shift ads to yet another platform. As chairman, chief executive and controlling shareholder, Zuckerberg could continue to bumble along. But he would do better to relinquish his executive role to a manager better equipped to address the problems - perhaps someone from the heavily regulated financial world, or a media executive. For inspiration, he could look to mentor Bill Gates. He gave up the CEO title at Microsoft nearly two decades ago.

The development comes as Facebook and other big tech companies face regulatory scrutiny, with growing bipartisan consensus to hold them accountable for business practices.  The U.S. Federal Trade Commission and nearly every U.S. state filed lawsuits against Facebook in December, saying it used a \u201cbuy or bury\u201d strategy to snap up rivals and keep smaller competitors at bay.  The complaints accused Facebook of buying up rivals, focusing specifically on its previous acquisitions of photo-sharing app Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and messaging app WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014.  The lawsuits were the biggest antitrust cases in a generation, comparable to the lawsuit against Microsoft Corp in 1998.

The controversy has been sparked by a recent Wall Street Journal report that said Das told staff that applying hate-speech rules to politicians close to India\u2019s ruling party \u201cwould damage the company\u2019s business prospects in the country\u201d.  \u201cWe take allegations of bias incredibly seriously, and want to make it clear that we denounce hate and bigotry in any form,\u201d Mohan said in the post.  \u201cWe have removed and will continue to remove content posted by public figures in India when it violates our Community Standards.\u201d  Facebook has been battling political fallout in India in recent days. The opposition Congress Party criticised Facebook for its policies, while some ruling-party lawmakers have accused it of censoring nationalist voices.  INDIA PANEL, OVERSIGHT BOARD  An Indian parliamentary panel on information technology will question Facebook executives on how it regulates content in the country, a panel member told Reuters on Friday.  Facebook has been summoned to appear on Sept. 2 and the discussion with Facebook will last for 30 minutes.  \u201cThe subject is serious because of Facebook\u2019s extensive reach in India ... and the potential for hate speech to incite violence and other unlawful behaviour,\u201d said the panel member, who declined to be identified.  Facebook - which has more than 300 million users in India, its biggest market - did not respond to a request for comment on being summoned by the panel.  Facebook has long faced criticism for high-profile content moderation issues.  Its soon-to-be-operational content Oversight Board, which some have dubbed the company\u2019s \u201cSupreme Court\u201d, said it was committed to protecting users.  \u201cHow Facebook treats posts from public figures that may violate the Community Standards are within the scope of the board,\u201d the board told Reuters in a statement.  \u201cWe won\u2019t shy away from the tough cases and holding Facebook accountable,\u201d said the board, which has powers to overturn decisions by the company and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg on whether individual pieces of content should be allowed or not.  Two Oversight Board members told Reuters on condition of anonymity they had not been briefed on the recent India issues. One of them said anti-Muslim hate speech is an issue the board was paying attention to more generally.  Facebook was handling the matter internally for now, but it was possible the India issue could become one of the cases the board reviews when it starts work in October, said the second member.","694":"April 23 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc has removed \u201cpseudoscience\u201d as an option for advertisers who want to target audiences, a category available until this week even as the world\u2019s largest social media network vowed to curb misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic.  The company eliminated this category from its \u201cdetailed targeting\u201d list on Wednesday, a Facebook spokeswoman said by phone, after tech news site The Markup showed that it could advertise a post targeting people interested in pseudoscience.  The Markup demonstrated that Facebook was allowing such ads after saying it would police COVID-19 misinformation on its platform. More than 78 million Facebook users were interested in \u201cpseudoscience,\u201d it said, citing the company\u2019s ad portal.  Misinformation about the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, from bogus cures to wide-ranging conspiracy theories, has also spread on rival social media platforms such Twitter Inc and YouTube, the video service of Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google.  Advocacy group Avaaz reported last week that a sample of 104 coronavirus-related pieces of misinformation content on Facebook analyzed by the group had reached over 117 million estimated views.  Data gathered by ProPublica in 2016 shows that Facebook assigned \u201cpseudoscience\u201d to users at that time, suggesting that the category has been available for several years.  Facebook has announced several initiatives to combat the spread of false COVID-19 claims, including removing content that could cause \u201cimminent physical harm\u201d and alerting people who have engaged with such misinformation, with a link to the World Health Organization website.  The company has also banned exploitative tactics in ads and banned ads for medical face masks, hand sanitizer, disinfecting wipes and COVID-19 test kits.  However, a test by Consumer Reports in April showed Facebook approving ads containing coronavirus misinformation, including false claims that the virus was a hoax or that people could stay healthy through small daily doses of bleach.  Facebook reaches 2.5 billion users monthly on its core platform, or 2.9 billion including those on its apps such as Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger.

Facebook has been under fire in recent years for its lax approach to fake news reports, state-backed disinformation campaigns and violent content spread on its services, prompting calls for new regulations around the world.  In a speech at Georgetown University filled with references to the First Amendment and the fight for democracy, Zuckerberg stood his ground, saying social media had introduced transformative avenues for speech that should not be shut down.  \u201cPeople having the power to express themselves at scale is a new kind of force in the world. It is a Fifth Estate alongside the other power structures of society,\u201d he said.  Zuckerberg framed the company\u2019s decisions around that concept, including its recent retreat from years of aggressive courtship of China, an obstacle to his vision of connecting the world\u2019s population.  He attacked the rapidly growing Chinese-owned app TikTok, saying the short video platform censored political protest, including in the United States, a charge the company denies.  In leaked audio of an address to Facebook employees weeks earlier, Zuckerberg spoke about TikTok as a formidable competitor, calling it the first consumer internet product built by a Chinese tech giant to find global success, but did not mention its approach to speech.  Over the course of Facebook\u2019s charm offensive, Zuckerberg met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, learned Mandarin and posted a photo of himself running through Tiananmen Square.  Facebook briefly won a license to open an \u201cinnovation hub\u201d in Hangzhou last year, but it was later revoked.  Zuckerberg effectively closed the door to China in March, when he announced his plan to pivot Facebook toward more private forms of communication and pledged not to build data centers in countries with \u201ca track record of violating human rights like privacy or freedom of expression.\u201d  He repeated his concern about data centers on Thursday, this time specifically naming China.  \u201cI wanted our services in China because I believe in connecting the whole world and I thought we might help create a more open society,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cI worked hard to make this happen. But we could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there, and they never let us in.\u201d  He received a question from the audience about what conditions or assurances he would need to enter the Chinese market, but did not address them in his response.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  \u201cFEIGNED CONCERN FOR FREE EXPRESSION\u201d  Zuckerberg also defended the company\u2019s political advertising policies on similar grounds, saying Facebook had at one time considered banning all political ads but decided against it, erring on the side of greater expression.  That assertion was immediately panned by critics, among them candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination who have asserted the company should do more to address disinformation and abuse ahead of the November 2020 election.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign quickly accused Zuckerberg of using \u201cthe Constitution as a shield\u201d for Facebook\u2019s bottom line.  \u201cHis choice to cloak Facebook\u2019s policy in a feigned concern for free expression demonstrates how unprepared his company is for this unique moment in our history and how little it has learned over the past few years,\u201d said spokesman Bill Russo.  U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, another leading contender for the Democratic nomination, has been especially vocal about her critiques of Facebook, bashing its advertising policy and calling for the company to be broken up on antitrust grounds.  She recently challenged Facebook\u2019s policy that exempts politicians\u2019 ads from fact-checking, running ads on the social media platform containing the false claim that Zuckerberg endorsed Trump\u2019s re-election bid.  But the focus on free speech is likely to win Zuckerberg some friends on the right, whom he has been courting aggressively in a recent visit to Washington and dinners at his home in California.  Republican lawmakers routinely accuse the company of showing \u201canti-conservative bias\u201d in its content moderation, without offering evidence. The company denies any favoritism.  Facebook has been under scrutiny after finding Russian propaganda on its platform which many believe affected the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, won by Donald Trump.  Trump has disputed claims that Russia has attempted to interfere in U.S. elections. Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied it.","696":"May 8 (Reuters) - Tinder-owner Match Group Inc reported a 36.4 percent jump in quarterly revenue on Tuesday as it attracted more subscribers to its dating apps and websites, and said Facebook Inc\u2019s plan to create a dating tool will not hurt Tinder.  Tinder, where people swipe right or left to signal interest or not in meeting partners, added 368,000 average subscribers in the first quarter from the previous quarter - lifting total users to 3.5 million.  Net profit attributable to Match shareholders soared to $99.7 million, or 33 cents per share in the three months ended March 31, from a year earlier. The company said the latest quarter included excess tax benefits from the settlement and exercise of stock-based awards.  Total revenue rose to $407.4 million from $298.8 million.  In May, Facebook said it was developing a dating feature for its 2.2 billion monthly users, sending Match shares down 22 percent.  Match Group Chief Executive Officer Mandy Ginsberg said Facebook\u2019s move could be \u201ccategory expansive\u201d.  \u201cIt\u2019s possible that given Facebook\u2019s reach, they could help chip away at the stigma, especially for users who are older and in international markets. And once people try one product, they\u2019ll use more than one,\u201d Ginsberg said in a statement.  Match is stepping up efforts to wean away Tinder users from using their Facebook accounts to log on to the dating service .  The company last year introduced an alternative to the Facebook-login and the number of users who signed up through the social network has declined significantly in North America, according to the company\u2019s investor presentation.  \u201cWhen given this choice 75 percent of new users opted not to use Facebook,\u201d Ginsberg said.  Analysts have said Facebook\u2019s foray would not likely be a threat to established dating sites, some of which are highly specialized to cater to specific groups.  Some analysts said both services could co-exist, despite Facebook\u2019s deeper pockets and larger, older userbase.  \u201cWe don\u2019t view dating as a zero sum game as users tend to traffic in multiple dating apps at any given time,\u201d Cowen and Company analyst John Blackledge wrote in a note after Facebook announced its dating services plan.

Facebook\u2019s abrupt decision to stop Australians from sharing news on the site and strip the pages of domestic and foreign news outlets also erased several state government and emergency department accounts, causing widespread anger.  The company has \u201ctentatively friended us again,\u201d Morrison told a news conference in Sydney. \u201cWhat I\u2019m pleased about it that Facebook is back at the table again.\u201d  Facebook has publicly indicated no change in its opposition to a proposed law requiring social media platforms to pay for links to news content. Morrison was not asked about that.  Australia\u2019s Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said on Friday he had spoken with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and further talks were expected over the weekend. It was not clear whether those talks have happened.  A Facebook spokeswoman and representatives for Frydenberg did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The stand-off comes as Australia\u2019s vows to press ahead with the landmark legislation, which could set a global precedent as countries like Canada express interest in taking similar action.  The Australian law, which would force Facebook and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google to reach commercial deals with Australian publishers or face compulsory arbitration, has cleared the lower house of parliament and is expected to be passed by the Senate within the next week.  Simon Milner, Facebook\u2019s Asia-Pacific policy director of policy for the Asia-Pacific region, was quoted on Saturday as telling the Sydney Morning Herald the company had three main objections to the legislation.  Facebook objects to being barred from discriminating between different news outlets that ask for money, to arbitration models that allow an independent body to select one payment over another, and to the obligation to enter commercial negotiations with Australian media companies, Milner said.  Facebook declined to make Milner available to speak with Reuters.  Australia\u2019s legislation is being widely watched overseas.  Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault said on Thursday his country would adopt the Australian approach as it crafts its own legislation in coming months.  Google, which has initially threatened to close its search engine in Australia, has announced host of preemptive licensing deals over the past week, including a global agreement with News Corp.  Facebook\u2019s move had an immediate impact on traffic to Australian new sites, according to early data from New York-based analytics firm Chartbeat.

REUTERS\/Ann Wang\/File Photo  Within a torrent of racist abuse and misinformation posted about him ahead of the polls are false claims he plans to close Buddhist monastic schools and to advocate for the teaching of Arabic.  \u201cThey use race and religion to attack me,\u201d the 33-year-old told Reuters in the commercial capital of Yangon, where he is standing for a seat won by the ruling party in the last election.  \u201cThese days people use social media more than ever ... and when they see false information 10 times it becomes the truth.\u201d  Social media companies face a global challenge to stop disinformation around elections, including the 2020 U.S. vote. In Myanmar, the stakes for Facebook are particularly high after previous accusations it helped incite genocide.  Half of Myanmar\u2019s 53 million people use Facebook, which for many is synonymous with the internet.  Facebook executives told Reuters hate speech in Myanmar was \u201cnear historic lows\u201d after it invested in resources from artificial intelligence language and photo detection to measures to slow the spread of viral content.  But civil society groups have found dozens of networks of accounts, pages, and groups spreading ethnically and religiously charged falsehoods that they fear could lead to strife and undermine the second election since the end of hardline army rule in 2011.  Reuters separately found more than two dozen inter-connected pages and accounts with a combined reach in the hundreds of thousands. The majority were removed after Reuters flagged them to Facebook.  \u201cThere\u2019s a short-term immediate concern of all this disinformation and hate speech fuelling real-world violence,\u201d said Jes Kaliebe Petersen, CEO of tech hub Phandeeyar, part of the Myanmar Tech Accountability Network (MTAN), a civil society group coordinating efforts to reduce risks posed by social media.  Harmful content, he said, is \u201cspreading like wildfire\u201d.  The government of leader Aung San Suu Kyi, her ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) and the election commission did not respond to requests for comment.  \u2018TYPICAL\u2019  Although the NLD is widely expected to win the election easily, as it did in 2015, there is precedent for social media hate speech leading to violence in Myanmar.  Anti-Muslim rumours on Facebook were widely seen as helping to trigger deadly riots in 2012 and 2014. In 2017, violent speech on Facebook was blamed for supporting an army crackdown on Rohingya Muslims that drove more than 730,000 to flee Myanmar.  But Rafael Frankel, Facebook\u2019s director of public policy for Southeast Asia, told Reuters ahead of the election: \u201cWhat we have seen so far is typical and nothing in any way out of the ordinary from what we would see in other parts of the world when an election is happening.\u201d  Even before campaigning got underway, Facebook deleted 280,000 items in Myanmar for hate speech in the second quarter of 2020, up from 51,000 in the first quarter.  Meanwhile, it is verifying accounts for some politicians - including Sithu Maung - and giving them a direct line for complaints.  Facebook also said it had taken down hundreds of accounts for \u201ccoordinated inauthentic behaviour\u201d including about 70 it traced to members of Myanmar\u2019s military on Oct. 8.  Among the blocked army-linked accounts were two that had attacked Sithu Maung with ethnic and religious slurs.  Twenty pages and pro-military accounts found by Reuters published simultaneous posts and included some newly created ones that replicated others that had only recently been blocked by Facebook.  The army did not respond to a request for comment.  Separately, Facebook said in a monthly report on coordinated inauthentic behavior on Friday it had dismantled a network of 36 accounts and six pages run by a Myanmar public relation firm that used fictitious people to profess support for the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP).  DISINFORMATION  It is not the first time Facebook has blocked pages linked to Myanmar\u2019s army: In 2018, it banned 20 top military officials and organisations for inauthentic behaviour, including commander in chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.  This week, Min Aung Hlaing accused unspecified social media platforms of bias in their treatment of Myanmar politics as he questioned the credibility of the elections more generally. Those claims were widely spread by pro-military accounts and pages found by Reuters and removed by Facebook.  But it is not only the army that has been using Facebook to spread disinformation, researchers say.  Some pages that Facebook has taken down had content supportive of Suu Kyi\u2019s NLD.  Opposition politicians, including from the USDP, the ruling NLD\u2019s biggest rival, have also been among the targets: branded as Muslim sympathisers or close to China by accounts whose origins are unclear.  The USDP did not respond to a request for comment.  Researchers say that the online vitriol is amplified by numerous \u201cinauthentic\u201d networks that spread narratives through inter-connected pages, groups, and fake accounts. Some pages, including dozens found by Reuters, style themselves as independent news or entertainment sources, and post the same content simultaneously on Facebook and other social media.  Others have taken out paid ads to promote politicians, including army chief Min Aung Hlaing - reaching more than a million people - but ran them without a disclaimer in violation of Facebook policies on political advertising.  \u201cFacebook has taken down a few networks of assets involved in this type of problematic behaviour, but there is a lot more,\u201d said MTAN researcher Victoire Rio.  \u201cThese malicious actors always seem to come back, often using the same names and logos, which calls into question Facebook\u2019s ability to tackle these issues comprehensively.\u201d","703":"Oct 17 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc has tentatively concluded that a recent hack that affected millions of accounts was perpetrated by spammers, and not a nation-state, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing sources.

In 2019, Google and Facebook accounted for nearly 80% of UK\u2019s digital advertising spending of about 14 billion pounds ($17.34 billion), helped by their large user and data base and deep pockets, the CMA said.  The regulator said while the services provided by the U.S.-based firms were \"highly valued\", it cautioned against their \"unassailable market positions that rivals can no longer compete on equal terms.\" (bit.ly\/3gjaTbV)  It proposed a \u201cDigital Markets Unit\u201d that would allow rival search engines to access Google\u2019s click and query data and restrict its ability to place itself as the default search-engine.  \u201cWe support regulation that benefits people, businesses and society and we\u2019ll continue to work constructively with regulatory authorities,\u201d said Ronan Harris, vice president for Google UK & Ireland.  The CMA also recommended Facebook be ordered to increase its interoperability with other social media platforms and give consumers a choice to opt for personalised advertising.  \u201cGiving people meaningful controls over how their data is collected and used is important ...

Parler Chief Executive Officer John Matze, who describes himself as libertarian, has said he founded the company in 2018 as a bipartisan platform but has doubled down on marketing to conservatives as they took to the site.

Mastercard and Visa abandoned the Geneva-based Libra Association on Friday, as did eBay, fintech startup Stripe and payments company Mercado Pago.  Politicians and regulators from the United States to Europe have said that Libra risks upsetting global financial stability, undermining users\u2019 privacy and facilitating money laundering.

REUTERS\/Philippe Wojazer\/File Photo  The settlement was filed on Monday in the federal court in Manhattan and won preliminary approval from U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet.  It amounts to a small fraction of Facebook\u2019s current market value of roughly $537 billion as of Monday\u2019s market close.  Shareholders led by the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System and Fresno County Employees\u2019 Retirement Association in California accused Facebook of concealing internal concerns about how growth in mobile devices might reduce revenue, even as it quietly warned its banks to cut their forecasts.  Unlike in 2012, the Menlo Park, California-based company now generates most of its revenue from mobile devices and has estimated that mobile advertising generated more than 86 percent of its $40.7 billion total revenue in 2017.  The settlement resolves claims against Facebook, officials including Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and director Peter Thiel, and bank underwriters covering a five-day period surrounding the $16 billion IPO, from May 17 to May 21, 2012.  Facebook made its market debut on May 18 of that year at $38 per share and saw its share price languish below that level for more than a year before it rebounded.  \u201cResolving this case is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders,\u201d Associate General Counsel Sandeep Solanki said in a statement.  A lawyer for the shareholders did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Sweet scheduled a Sept. 5 hearing to consider final settlement approval.  The accord was reached after mediation, and provides an average recovery of about 11 cents per share, or 7 cents per share after possible legal fees and costs, court papers show.  Insurers may cover some of the payout.  Lawyers for the shareholders called the settlement \u201cfair, reasonable, and adequate,\u201d citing the risk of a loss at trial, according to court papers.

The launch comes as Facebook is trying to pivot toward more private forms of communication, after years of slowing user growth, data-sharing scandals and calls for change to its hands-off approach to content moderation.  The company is already one of the biggest global players in private messaging, with its WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram apps used by 2.4 billion people each month.  It is keeping the focus of its new Portal line on video calling, adding the capability for WhatsApp calls along with improvements to a wide-angle camera that keeps users in focus as they move about a room.  Facebook is also expanding Portal sales into countries including the UK, France and Australia, while lowering prices to more closely compete with industry-leading smart speakers from Amazon and Google that sell for under $100.  Standard models of the Portal, which ship on Oct. 15, will come in $129 and $179 versions. Portal TV will cost $149 and hit the shelves on Nov. 5.  Facebook is hoping the social nature of its products will be their selling point, allowing users to watch shows together while interacting via video call on the same screen.  \u201cI think that in a couple years\u2019 time, if you have a smart streaming device that doesn\u2019t have a camera allowing you to video call people, you\u2019re not going to have a competitive product,\u201d said vice president of AR\/VR Andrew Bosworth. \u201cI think this is the killer feature for a device like this.\u201d  Bosworth also touted privacy protections like local processing of smart features on the devices, which means most user data will not be sent back to Facebook servers.  But Portal TV offers only a few music apps and has limited options for TV programing, meaning it could face a stiff challenge in attracting consumers used to content-rich rivals like Apple TV, Netflix and Roku.  At a demonstration in San Francisco on Tuesday, the only way to stream shows appeared to be via Facebook\u2019s Watch app. Executives said Portal TV would have Amazon\u2019s Prime Video app loaded by the time it is available.  The company declined to say whether it had approached other content providers like HBO, Hulu or Disney.  Facebook does not disclose how many Portals it has sold since the device\u2019s launch late last year, but hardware accounts for a tiny slice of the company\u2019s total sales.  The social media giant makes less than 2 percent of its revenue from non-advertising sources.","712":"NEW DELHI, Aug 19 (Reuters) - India\u2019s antitrust watchdog has dismissed a case against Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp, saying the company has not abused its dominant position to expand in the country\u2019s digital payments market, according to an official order.  A case in March alleged that WhatsApp was bundling its digital payment facility - WhatsApp Pay - within its messaging app for which it already has a large user base. The case alleged WhatsApp was abusing its position by forcing its payments feature on to its existing users.  In a 41-page official order made public late on Tuesday, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) said it did not find any contravention of antitrust laws, adding the company\u2019s \u201cactual conduct is yet to manifest in the market\u201d as it has not fully launched the service yet.  \u201cAs stated by WhatsApp, the number of users being served under the beta version is limited to less than 1% of its users in India,\u201d said the order.  The order will come as a relief for WhatsApp, which is seen close to a full launch of its payments service in its biggest market by users but one where it has for months struggled to get required clearances. The Supreme Court is separately hearing cases challenging the expansion of its payment service.  WhatsApp did not respond to a request for comment.  In its defence, the company had told the CCI its users are not required to register for or use WhatsApp\u2019s payment feature in order to use the messaging service, the order said.

REUTERS\/Costas Baltas  Merkel, chancellor of Europe\u2019s largest economy since 2005, decided last year after a series of election setbacks to relinquish leadership of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and not run for another term.  In the video, Merkel thanked her 2.5 million followers and invited them to continue following her via the government\u2019s official Facebook page or on Instagram, which shares pictures.  \u201cToday is the day on which I would like to thank you for all your support of my Facebook page,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know that I am no longer CDU president, so I will now close my Facebook page.\u201d  For a public figure to close down a social media presence with such a large following is an unusual move, leading some to speculate that, whatever else Merkel plans for her post-chancellor life, she envisages doing so as a private citizen.  Her 13-year dominance of European politics has made her retirement a guessing game, with some expecting her to take up a senior role in the European Union or the United Nations.  Merkel has always deflected questions over her future.  Building a large social media following to serve as a valuable communications channel is arduous work.  Merkel\u2019s following is ahead of her friend and ally French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s 2.3 million followers, and dwarfs Britain\u2019s Theresa May\u2019s 503,000.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The move is the latest salvo in a long-running cold war between two of the world\u2019s most powerful tech companies, which have clashed over their approaches to user privacy as both face regulatory scrutiny over alleged anticompetitive behavior.  Facebook said it requested the waiver so that small businesses would not have to pay Apple\u2019s cut for a new paid online events product the world\u2019s biggest social media company is launching on its core platform.  Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  On Thursday, Apple removed popular video game \u201cFortnite\u201d from its app store for violating its in-app payment guidelines, sparking a backlash online and prompting developer Epic Games to file a federal antitrust lawsuit challenging Apple\u2019s rules.  Apple takes a cut of between 15% and 30% for most app subscriptions and payments made inside apps, though there are some exceptions for companies that already have a credit card on file for iPhone customers if they also offer an in-app payment that would benefit Apple.  Developers have long criticized the commissions, as well as Apple\u2019s prohibitions on courting customers for outside sign-ups, and what some developers see as an opaque and unpredictable app-vetting process.  A mock-up of the new events product on iPhone, provided by Facebook, showed that the company planned to tell users that Apple would take 30% of the purchase.  Google GOOGL.O also typically takes a 30% commission for payments within apps on its Android devices, although it was not immediately clear whether it would assess a charge in this case. In its Android mock-up, Facebook noted only that it would not take a fee, without disclosing its arrangement with Google.  Google declined to comment on its fee arrangement for the product, and Facebook did not respond to the request for comment.  Facebook also did not say whether it had tried to make use of Apple\u2019s \u201cmultiplatform\u201d exceptions.  The disclosure is likely to touch a nerve with Apple, whose App Store rules bar developers from discouraging the use of its in-app purchase system. Spotify in the past has said Apple rejected its attempts to communicate with users about the fee structures.  Fidji Simo, who heads the core Facebook app, announced the tool in a media conference call featuring small business owners who praised it as a way to reach customers and earn revenue online during the coronavirus pandemic.  She said Facebook considered it \u201cimportant to be transparent, when people are supporting small businesses,\u201d as users might not be aware that part of their payments could be \u201cgoing to an almost $2 trillion company.\u201d  Asked if she thought Apple would approve the change, even with language about fees that could discourage users from using the in-app purchase mechanism, she said she expected to find out \u201cin the next couple days.\u201d","717":"April 8 (Reuters) - Zoom Video Communications Inc has hired former Facebook security chief Alex Stamos as an adviser and formed an advisory board to improve the video conferencing app\u2019s privacy and security issues amid a global backlash against the platform.

We\u2019ve told them no. That request came with some threats about what might happen if we didn\u2019t.\u201d  The official said the threats included shutting down Facebook altogether in Vietnam, a major market for the social media company where it earns revenue of nearly $1 billion, according to two sources familiar with the numbers.  Facebook has faced mounting pressure from governments over its content policies, including threats of new regulations and fines. But it has avoided a ban in all but the few places where it has never been allowed to operate, such as China.  In Vietnam, despite sweeping economic reform and increasing openness to social change, the ruling Communist Party retains tight control of media and tolerates little opposition. The country ranks fifth from bottom in a global ranking of press freedom compiled by Reporters Without Borders.  Vietnam\u2019s foreign ministry said in response to questions from Reuters that Facebook should abide by local laws and cease \u201cspreading information that violates traditional Vietnamese customs and infringes upon state interests\u201d.

Facebook has long faced criticism from rights group for being too compliant with government censorship requests.  \u201cHowever, we will do everything we can to ensure that our services remain available so people can continue to express themselves,\u201d the spokeswoman said.  Vietnam has tried to launch home-grown social media networks to compete with Facebook, but none has reached any meaningful level of popularity.

FILE PHOTO: Brazil's Central Bank President Roberto Campos Neto speaks near Brazil's Economy Minister Paulo Guedes while leaving Alvorada Palace in Brasilia, Brazil April 27, 2020. REUTERS\/Ueslei Marcelino\/File Photo  The ubiquitous messaging service was finally entering the financial services arena with a payment service in Latin America\u2019s largest economy, after years of questions over how Facebook would make money from it.  The June launch, years in the planning, was meant to be the pilot for a potential global rollout - but eight days after going live, the central bank pulled the plug on it.  The shock decision underscores the challenge for Facebook in trying to win over financial regulators and the complexities facing watchdogs in assessing the risks of letting tech giants, with their vast network of users, loose in their world.  In Brazil, it also raises questions about the communications around the launch. WhatsApp executives and central bank officials had held at least three meetings in the previous 21 months, including two in the week running up to the launch.  In the first time he has spoken in detail about the decision, Central Bank President Roberto Campos Neto told Reuters the regulator had not determined how to deal with the proposed payment model - a new phenomenon in Brazil, which has no card money transfer service operated via an app.  \u201cPrior to the launch, there was a meeting in which WhatsApp kind of explained its plan, but the central bank was taken by surprise with the launch on June 15,\u201d he said in an interview.  The regulator - which said it never received a formal launch request - suspended the service, Facebook Pay, on June 23.  Campos Neto and other officials said concerns centered on competition, data privacy - they have not provided details - and ongoing deliberations over whether WhatsApp required a license as a company offering or arranging payment services.  WhatsApp told Reuters it had answered central bank questions and provided the launch schedule during the final meetings.  \u201cWe spoke openly about our plans to bring WhatsApp payments to Brazil,\u201d it said. The company added it was deeply concerned about users\u2019 privacy, financial details were stored on a secured network and it had data security contracts with all partners.  WhatsApp said it did not want to become a financial services company. Financial institutions in Brazil are subject to capital reserve requirements and strict regulations.  As a way around this, and within existing rules, WhatsApp sought to use Visa Inc V.N and Mastercard Inc MA.N, which already had central bank licenses, to carry out the money transfers.  \u201cWhatsApp contacted us roughly two years ago to build a payments solution to bring convenience for their users and also because it did not want to become a financial institution,\u201d Visa\u2019s Brazil chief Fernando Teles said.  \u2018IN A PHASE OF ADJUSTING\u2019  Slideshow ( 2 images )  WhatsApp said the service used payments networks from Visa and Mastercard, which are regulated companies in Brazil.  However Campos Neto said a money-transfer service provided by a tech platform had never existed in Brazil, the central bank had not yet decided whether WhatsApp itself needed a license.  \u201cIt\u2019s worth remembering that big tech isn\u2019t in the payments space in a big part of the world,\u201d he told Reuters on July 8. \u201cSo we\u2019re still in a phase of adjusting our regulations.\u201d  It is not the first time Facebook appears to have misread the regulatory runes as it seeks to enter the data-rich world of finance. A year ago, it unveiled plans for the Libra cryptocurrency, only to be met with a backlash from central banks.  In Brazilian payments, the prize is large, with a burgeoning market that saw 1.8 trillion reais ($336.86 billion) in card transactions last year. See GRAPHIC: tmsnrt.rs\/2NTMSvG  In the initial stages of its service, WhatsApp was also looking to make use of a provision in payments regulation allowing companies to start services without a license until they reached 500 million reais or 25 million transactions over a 12-month period, according to a source close to the company.  This, again, is within the rules. However the provision, Campos Neto said, was aimed at encouraging small businesses to enter the market as opposed to a big tech network like WhatsApp with 120 million Brazilian users.  \u201cWhatsApp tried to take advantage of this rule, saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to start with very low volumes because once we\u2019re in the system, it will be tough to take us out\u2019,\u201d he said, describing the company as using \u201cthis volume gimmick\u201d.  The central bank changed this provision on June 23 to allow it to suspend companies covered by it.  Three meetings were held between WhatsApp and the central bank about the payment service, according to public central bank records: in October 2018, plus this year on June 9 and 12 - with one of those final talks attended by Campos Neto and WhatsApp Chief Operating Officer Matthew Idema.  WhatsApp said it also presented the central bank with its partnership model in 2019, although Reuters could not independently verify that meeting and the central bank declined to comment on meetings or dates.  Visa and Mastercard told Reuters they did not notify the central bank they planned to perform transfers for WhatsApp because they thought they already had the required licenses.  \u201cThere was no specific rule about messaging services in payments in Brazil, so we did it (the partnership) complying with existing rules,\u201d said Joao Pedro Paro, president of Mastercard for Latin America Southern Cone.  FACEBOOK\u2019S GLOBAL AMBITIONS  The setback is the latest blow to Facebook\u2019s global payments ambitions, key to boosting revenue in the developing markets that account for most of its user growth and realizing CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s vision to stitch together the infrastructure underlying Facebook\u2019s apps, which also include Instagram.  WhatsApp has been trying to launch payments since 2018 in India, its biggest market, but remains stuck in beta testing.  The Brazilian service would not charge individual users, but merchants would pay a fee per transaction.  One competition concern, according to a source close to the central bank, centers on WhatsApp's planned use of Cielo SA CIEL3.SA as its payments processor - or acquirer - for cards like Visa and Mastercard. Cielo already has a dominant market share of 40% in Brazil.  \u201cI also must see the platform is open, which means that if more acquirers want to be in the platform, they are free to participate,\u201d said Campos Neto, though he did not mention Cielo.  WhatsApp, which has signed a deal with Cielo, said it did not have an exclusivity arrangement. Cielo declined to comment, but earlier told an antitrust watchdog there was no exclusivity.  In a further twist, the central bank is itself planning to roll out a fast-payment system in November, Pix, which uses consumers\u2019 checking accounts, a different terrain from Facebook Pay. WhatsApp has said it is open to integrating its service with Pix, which could offer one way to help break the deadlock.  The future remains uncertain, however.  Since Facebook Pay was suspended, central bank officials have met executives from WhatsApp, Mastercard and Visa in an attempt to find a way through.  Visa and Mastercard both delivered new business plans to the regulator last week in which WhatsApp formally appears as the originator of payments to be processed by the two other firms.  \u201cWhatsApp did not, and still does not, need to request a license to work with our partners,\u201d WhatsApp said. \u201cIf a change were to require WhatsApp to obtain a license, we would do so.\u201d","722":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Facebook's FB.O proposed Libra currency could undermine the European Central Bank's ability to set monetary policy and Europe should ignore its siren call of \"treacherous promises\" ECB board member Yves Mersch said on Monday.  Facebook announced Libra \u2014 a new digital coin backed by four official currencies and available to billions of social network users around the world \u2014 earlier this year, saying it hoped to launch next year.  \u201cDepending on Libra\u2019s level of acceptance and on the referencing of the euro in its reserve basket, it could reduce the ECB\u2019s control over the euro, impair the monetary policy transmission mechanism by affecting the liquidity position of euro area banks, and undermine the single currency\u2019s international role,\u201d Mersch added.  Like regular currencies, Libra would be highly centralized, an \u201cextremely concerning\u201d setup since it is not backed by a lender of last resort and it is ultimately accountable to shareholders, who are not seen as repositories of public trust, Mersch added.  \u201cIt is scheduled for release in the first half of 2020 by the very same people who had to explain themselves in front of legislators in the United States and the European Union on the threats to our democracies resulting from their handling of personal data on their social media platform,\u201d Mersch added.  Given these challenges, European regulatory and supervisory authorities need to assert jurisdiction over Libra and also need global cooperation to mitigate its risks.  \u201cI sincerely hope that the people of Europe will not be tempted to leave behind the safety and soundness of established payment solutions and channels in favor of the beguiling but treacherous promises of Facebook\u2019s siren call,\u201d Mersch added.","723":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc FB.O said on Wednesday that company moderators during the last quarter removed 8.7 million user images of child nudity with the help of previously undisclosed software that automatically flags such photos.  FILE PHOTO: A Facebook page is displayed on a computer screen in Brussels, Belgium, April 21, 2010. REUTERS\/Thierry Roge\/File Photo  The machine learning tool rolled out over the last year identifies images that contain both nudity and a child, allowing increased enforcement of Facebook\u2019s ban on photos that show minors in a sexualized context.  A similar system also disclosed on Wednesday catches users engaged in \u201cgrooming,\u201d or befriending minors for sexual exploitation.  Facebook\u2019s global head of safety Antigone Davis told Reuters in an interview that the \u201cmachine helps us prioritize\u201d and \u201cmore efficiently queue\u201d problematic content for the company\u2019s trained team of reviewers.  The company is exploring applying the same technology to its Instagram app.  Under pressure from regulators and lawmakers, Facebook has vowed to speed up removal of extremist and illicit material. Machine learning programs that sift through the billions of pieces of content users post each day are essential to its plan.  Machine learning is imperfect, and news agencies and advertisers are among those that have complained this year about Facebook\u2019s automated systems wrongly blocking their posts.  Davis said the child safety systems would make mistakes but users could appeal.  \u201cWe\u2019d rather err on the side of caution with children,\u201d she said.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Facebook\u2019s rules for years have banned even family photos of lightly clothed children uploaded with \u201cgood intentions,\u201d concerned about how others might abuse such images.  Before the new software, Facebook relied on users or its adult nudity filters to catch child images. A separate system blocks child pornography that has previously been reported to authorities.  Facebook has not previously disclosed data on child nudity removals, though some would have been counted among the 21 million posts and comments it removed in the first quarter for sexual activity and adult nudity.  Shares of Facebook fell 5 percent on Wednesday.  Facebook said the program, which learned from its collection of nude adult photos and clothed children photos, has led to more removals. It makes exceptions for art and history, such as the Pulitzer Prize-winning photo of a naked girl fleeing a Vietnam War napalm attack.  The child grooming system evaluates factors such as how many people have blocked a particular user and whether that user quickly attempts to contact many children, Davis said.  Michelle DeLaune, chief operating officer at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), said the organization expects to receive about 16 million child porn tips worldwide this year from Facebook and other tech companies, up from 10 million last year.  With the increase, NCMEC said it is working with Facebook to develop software to decide which tips to assess first.  Still, DeLaune acknowledged that a crucial blind spot is encrypted chat apps and secretive \u201cdark web\u201d sites where much of new child pornography originates.  Encryption of messages on Facebook-owned WhatsApp, for example, prevents machine learning from analyzing them.  DeLaune said NCMEC would educate tech companies and \u201chope they use creativity\u201d to address the issue.","724":"NEW YORK\/LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin jumped to an 18-month high on Wednesday, as investors looked for safety in alternative investments amid geopolitical tension, and cheered prospects that Facebook Inc\u2019s Libra token could push cryptocurrencies into the mainstream.  The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency has surged in value since April and on Wednesday hit a peak of $13,666.02 on the Bitstamp exchange, the highest level since January 2018. So far this year, bitcoin has risen more than 260%, although it remains below its all-time high of nearly $20,000 hit in December 2017.  Bitcoin last traded up 14.7% at $13,475.  Investors have flocked back in to digital currencies after a bruising 2018. Bitcoin has risen for eight consecutive days. And now Facebook has said it would offer its own cryptocurrency, the Libra coin, by end of June 2020.  Analysts say Facebook\u2019s announcement this month has revived interest in digital currencies, while investors seeking safety have also pushed up bitcoin\u2019s price.  \u201cCryptocurrency traders were reinvigorated by Facebook\u2019s launch of their own digital coin and momentum appears to be stirring up fresh new investors,\u201d said Edward Moya, senior market analyst, at online FX broker OANDA in New York.  \u201cBitcoin skeptics are cautious in trying to stop this surge and may look for the next key resistance level which is $15,000,\u201d he added.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  With major central banks keeping interest rates near all-time lows, investors have been looking for ways to diversify their portfolios, including through cryptocurrenies, analysts said.  Bitcoin CME futures volumes have also increased in the past few days, as investors look for ways to get their hands on the coin via the derivatives market.  Traders, who have access to both spot and futures markets have been buying the spot and selling the futures, arbitraging the two prices, said Michael Moro, chief executive officer at Genesis Global Trading, which provides over-the-counter digital currency trading for institutional investors.  The cryptocurrency has rocketed 150% since early May, along with big rises in other smaller digital currencies such as Ethereum\u2019s ether and Ripple\u2019s XRP.  \u201cIt should be noted that this a very different market today than it was in 2017,\u201d said Moro.  \u201c2017 saw an overwhelming number of ICOs (initial coin offerings), which was very distracting. 2019 has less distractions. It\u2019s also a different space because the CME bitcoin futures product wasn\u2019t available until December 2017.\u201d  ICOs refer to a fundraising scheme that bypasses banks and venture capital firms and involves startups creating their own tokens and selling them to the public.

Its WhatsApp messaging app is already encrypted.

Facebook rejected that call in a letter signed by WhatsApp head Will Cathcart and Messenger head Stan Chudnovsky which it released along with the company\u2019s written testimony.  \u201cThe \u2018backdoor\u2019 access you are demanding for law enforcement would be a gift to criminals, hackers and repressive regimes,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThat is not something we are prepared to do.\u201d  Apple weathered a legal fight over encryption in 2016, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation sought access to an iPhone owned by a slain sympathizer of Islamic State in San Bernardino, California, who had murdered county employees.  That stand helped bolster the company\u2019s reputation for protecting user privacy, while Facebook has been mired in a series of scandals in recent years over its handling of personal data.  In their testimony, Facebook\u2019s messaging privacy chief Jay Sullivan traded barbs with Apple privacy head Erik Neuenschwander, each suggesting lawmakers focus their scrutiny on the other company\u2019s business.  Sullivan said repeatedly that Facebook does not build devices or operating systems, and suggested the company was open to \u201con-device scanning\u201d proposals that would automatically identify matches for illegal content.  \u201cWe don\u2019t have forums for strangers to contact each other ... and our business doesn\u2019t have us scanning material of our users to build profiles of them,\u201d said Neuenschwander.","727":"Reuters Fact Check. REUTERS  Facebook users have claimed that pharmaceutical company Merck has said it is better to catch COVID-19 and recover naturally than it is to get vaccinated. This is false. It is a misrepresentation of a statement from Merck.  Multiple posts on Facebook have shared this claim in different ways, whether in written posts, memes or screenshots. One such post reads: \u201cVaccine manufacturer Merck scraps COVID vaccine, saying studies show it\u2019s more effective to get the virus and recover than get the vaccine\u201d (here). Another says: \u201cAccording to Merck, they have determined it's better to just get the virus and develop antibodies than taking a vaccine. They have abandoned vaccine development in favour of alternative therapies\u201d (here).  These posts appear to have misinterpreted a recent statement from Merck, which announced on Jan. 25 that it was dropping research on V590 and V591, its two candidate vaccines for COVID-19, to focus on therapeutics instead (here).  Citing its reasons for discontinuing development, the American pharmaceutical giant said: \u201cThis decision follows Merck\u2019s review of findings from Phase 1 clinical studies for the vaccines. In these studies, both V590 and V591 were generally well tolerated, but the immune responses were inferior to those seen following natural infection and those reported for other SARS-CoV-2\/COVID-19 vaccines.\u201d (here)  Therefore, Merck was referring to trial data showing its own vaccine candidates having an inferior result compared to a natural immune response to COVID-19. It was not advising against delivery of other COVID-19 vaccines. As it noted in its statement, other candidate vaccines have led to recipients showing a stronger immune response.  VERDICT  Misleading. Merck did not say it is better to catch COVID-19 than get vaccinated.

FILE PHOTO: Small toy figures are seen on representations of virtual currency in front of the Libra logo in this illustration picture, June 21, 2019. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  Stablecoins are tied to a traditional currency or basket of assets, and used for payments or storing value.  The G20\u2019s Financial Stability Board (FSB) set out 10 recommendations on Tuesday for a common, international approach to regulating stablecoins, prompted by social media giant Facebook proposing its Libra stablecoin.  They should face the same rules as other businesses that present the same risks, regardless of technology used, it said.  Existing financial rules, such as for payments and customer checks, generally apply in whole or in part to stablecoins and address at least some of the risks they generate, the FSB said.  Coverage, however, can be patchy from country to country, exposing gaps for supervising a cross-border stablecoin, the FSB said.  The recommendations propose flexible, cross-border cooperation to avoid a stablecoin playing off one jurisdiction against another.  \u201cRelevant authorities should, where necessary, clarify regulatory powers and address potential gaps in their domestic frameworks to adequately address risks posed by global stablecoins,\u201d the FSB said.  Stablecoin operators must effectively manage risks, be operationally resilient, have safeguards against cyber attacks, and systems for stopping money laundering and terrorist financing, it said.  Several of Libra\u2019s major backers, including Visa, Mastercard and PayPal, have since dropped out after scepticism from regulators and central banks, which said it must not be launched until adequate rules are in place.  Facebook\u2019s potentially huge reach in cross-border payments would make it an instant, systemic rival to traditional currencies, central banks have said  The company said last month it was still planning to offer the Libra token but was also working on digital versions of government-backed currencies.  The Switzerland-based Libra, which will issue and govern the digital currency, has said that it welcomes the regulatory scrutiny. It declined to comment further.  Central banks are also looking into the possibility of issuing their own digital currencies as the use of cash for payments declines. The threat to their control over money posed by Libra\u2019s potential launch has been a major factor in accelerating research efforts.  Existing stablecoins, many of which are available internationally, are still small in scale and pose no risks to financial stability, but this could change if use significantly increased, the FSB said.  The largest, Tether, with a market capitalisation of around $6.3 billion, it still a fraction of the size of bitcoin. It is little used beyond the world of cryptocurrency trading.  The FSB\u2019s public consultation is open until July 15, with a final report published in October.","731":"Feb 18 (Reuters) - Shares of Facebook Inc were down around 1 percent on Thursday, in line with moves in other major tech shares as Wall Street largely shrugged off outrage around the company\u2019s decision to block all news content in Australia.

Shares rose nearly 2% after hours to $191.49.  Third-quarter revenue rose 29% compared with a year ago to $17.65 billion, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $17.37 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The world\u2019s largest social media company reported $6.09 billion in profit, or $2.12 per share. Analysts expected $5.47 billion in profit, or $1.91 per share.  Over the last three years, Facebook has faced rising hostility from both users and lawmakers over its handling of user data and its inability to ensure the integrity of its popular news feeds. It also faces growing regulatory challenges as U.S. authorities investigate whether it has engaged in anti-competitive practices.  Debra Aho, eMarketer principal analyst, said she was \u201cnot surprised\u201d by Facebook\u2019s solid results.  \u201cAdvertisers continue to support Facebook, despite the many controversies swirling around the company, and the user base also continues to expand around the world,\u201d Aho said in an emailed statement. \u201cYes, Facebook has a lot of challenges it must deal with, but increasing its revenue and user count isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d  Facebook, the world\u2019s No. 2 seller of online ads, had experienced about 18 months of slow sales growth and elevated spending heading into the third quarter. Concerns over privacy have fueled an acceleration in costs for privacy staff and other roles.  Facebook\u2019s privacy scandals have helped inspire browser makers, operating system vendors and other software companies to provide people with more tools to block the type of online tracking that has been essential to Facebook\u2019s algorithms for targeting ads.  Facebook, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google have been under pressure to police their platforms after facing criticism for failing to counter alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  In recent weeks, Facebook has come under fire over its decision not to fact-check ads run by politicians on the platform.  Twitter\u2019s CEO, Jack Dorsey, on Wednesday said Twitter will ban political advertising on its platform from Nov. 22.  Facebook\u2019s existing businesses continue to grow at a fast pace. But whether it can maintain the momentum has been unclear with newer ventures including privacy-focused messaging services, its expansion into online dating or its burgeoning features for group discussions and eBay-like shopping center.  For the quarter, the company reported 2.8 billion monthly users and 2.2 billion daily users across Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, both slightly higher than the prior quarter.  Facebook itself had 1.62 billion daily users, versus estimates of 1.61 billion. Monthly active users rose to 2.45 billion, in line with estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Facebook, which experienced stagnant user growth in Europe and the United States in previous quarters, added daily users compared to the previous quarter in all four of its regions for the first time this year.  Facebook also said one of its board directors, Susan Desmond-Hellmann, chief executive of The Bill and Melina Gates Foundation, would be stepping down and that a replacement would be named in the coming months. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said she is leaving for health and other commitments.  Facebook shares have gained about 43.6% this year through Wednesday\u2019s close, thanks to above-expectations revenue in the first half of the year. The company reached a $5 billion settlement in a U.S. Federal Trade Commission probe, which started after its Cambridge Analytica data misuse scandal and threatened to cost the company several more billions.  Even so, shares have not recovered to their record closing high of $194.32 in June 2018, just before a dramatic drop that summer amid escalating costs.  And Facebook still faces extensive regulatory challenges. Its competitive practices are under investigation separately by the U.S. Congress, Department of Justice, FTC and 47 state attorneys general.  The break-up or tighter regulation of Facebook and other big tech firms over antitrust concerns has also emerged as a key issue for Democratic candidates in the run-up to the November 2020 U.S. presidential election.  Last week, Zuckerberg was grilled by U.S. lawmakers on issues from Facebook\u2019s planned digital currency Libra to election interference.  The Libra project has faltered in recent weeks amid sustained criticism from lawmakers and regulators globally over fears it may aid money laundering and upend the global financial system.

The entrance sign to Facebook headquarters is seen through two moving buses in Menlo Park, California, on Wednesday, October 10, 2018. REUTERS\/Elijah Nouvelage  Little data is typically published on specific companies\u2019 online ad spending, but Facebook\u2019s increased transparency about political activity on its service has opened a trove of details ahead of elections on Nov. 6. The social media network showed that $256.4 million was spent on political ads since May.  Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Twitter Inc have introduced similar databases. But compared to Facebook, Google covers a narrower set of advertisers and Twitter\u2019s tool is more difficult to use.  The database unveiled by Facebook on Tuesday, called the \u201cAd Archive Report,\u201d will provide weekly updates on how much advertisers are spending on Facebook ads that specifically, encourage voting or mention political races or issues of national importance.  That policy pulls in ads from official campaigns as well as paid posts containing a political dimension from boutique apparel makers, talk-show hosts and global firms.  Oil giant ExxonMobil has spent more than $2.1 million on Facebook ads since May, more than any corporation beside online petition service Care2.com Inc. ExxonMobil has promoted a campaign supporting offshore drilling and urged a \u201cno\u201d vote on a Colorado ballot measure that would limit fracking.  The company did not immediately respond to a request to comment.  Ben & Jerry\u2019s, a part of Unilever Plc, has spent more than $401,000 since May on various ads, including one supporting a Florida ballot measure that would let felons vote.  Jay Tandan, the ice cream maker\u2019s U.S. digital marketing manager, said the company welcomed the transparency.  \u201cWe\u2019ve long stood up for our company values and used our tools as a business \u2013 including monetary expenditure and our social media presence \u2013 to support driving the change we hope to see in the world,\u201d Tandan said in an email.  Penzeys, a nationwide retailer of spices based in Wisconsin, has put $773,000 into ads calling on people to vote despite any political frustration they may have following the contentious Senate confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.  \u201cMake your plan to vote, but please give thought to encouraging others to vote, too,\u201d one ad seen by at least hundreds of thousands Facebook accounts said. \u201cHelp them put together the ingredients they need for a healthy and satisfying voting experience.\u201d  Smaller firms are aiming to capitalize on the election too. California-based Concealed Online, which sells firearms training for concealed carry permits, has spent $1.76 million encouraging people in Texas, Florida and other states to apply before a possible shift in power brings gun restrictions.  To be sure, Facebook\u2019s transparency has limits. It privately requires government-issued identification from political ad buyers but allows them pseudoanonymity in public disclosures through vague names such as Be Registered LLC.  The tech companies\u2019 political spending databases arrived after the threat of regulation over the lack of disclosure on such spending.  Facebook also has faced a barrage of criticism from users and lawmakers after it said last year that Russian agents used its platform to spread misinformation before and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election, an accusation Moscow denies.","736":"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese authorities have set up a working group to discuss the impact Facebook\u2019s proposed Libra digital coin could have on monetary policy and financial regulation, government sources said, ahead of a G7 finance leaders\u2019 gathering where the topic will be high on the agenda.  FILE PHOTO: Small toy figures are seen on representations of virtual currency in front of the Libra logo in this illustration picture, June 21, 2019. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  The working group, consisting of the Bank of Japan, the Ministry of Finance and the Financial Services Agency, began meeting this week and will seek to coordinate policies to address the impact Libra could have on regulation, monetary policy, tax and payments settlement, the sources said.  The plan by the social media giant to build a digital currency has raised concerns among global regulators that it could quickly become systemic given Facebook\u2019s huge cross-border reach.  France is using its presidency of the Group of 7 group of economic powers to launch a task force to look at how central banks can ensure digital currencies like Libra are regulated from money-laundering to consumer-protection rules.  European Central Bank policymaker Benoit Coeure is due to deliver a preliminary report on the matter next week at a meeting of G7 finance ministers in Chantilly, north of Paris.  Japan hopes to rally support from other countries to expand the task force into a bigger group of tax and financial regulators, given the wide range of policies that could be affected by digital currencies, the officials said.  In Japan, the central bank does not oversee banking regulation, which is handled by the Financial Services Agency.  As this year\u2019s chair of the bigger G20 group of major economies, Japan will also look at ways to align efforts made separately by the G7 and G20 to address the policy implications of Libra, the officials said.  At a summit last month in Japan held after Facebook\u2019s announcement of the Libra plan, the G20 leaders said they were closely monitoring developments and \u201cvigilant to existing and emerging risks\u201d involving crypto-assets.  They also urged regulators including the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to advise the G20 on multilateral responses to the growing presence of crypto-assets.","737":"(Reuters) - An Irish regulator said on Friday it was investigating Facebook Inc FB.O following the company's disclosure that a bug may have exposed private photos of up to 6.8 million users, the latest in a series of Facebook privacy glitches.  The Irish Data Protection Commissioner (DPC), the lead regulator of Facebook in the European Union, said it was investigating to determine whether the company had complied with strict new EU privacy rules in its response to a number of breaches, including the one that exposed photos.  Facebook said in a statement that it was in close contact with the Irish regulator and happy to answer any questions.  The investigation is the second opened by the DPC into Facebook since the new regulations took effect in May.  Facebook disclosed the photo glitch earlier on Friday, saying it allowed some 1,500 software apps to access private photos for 12 days ending Sept. 25.  \u201cWe\u2019re sorry this happened,\u201d Facebook said in a blog.  The European data law requires companies to report data breaches to authorities within 72 hours, giving regulators authority to impose fines of up to 4 percent of annual global revenue for infractions.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Facebook said it would alert users whose photos may have been exposed.  The glitch could undermine Facebook\u2019s efforts to assure users and regulators that it was making progress in bolstering security and privacy after a series of embarrassments, internet analysts said.  They include the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which the British political consulting firm harvested data of at least 87 million Facebook users and sold it for political use and a security breach for nearly 30 million users.  \u201cWe already have a lot of evidence to reinforce the idea that Facebook is sloppy, prioritizing growth at the expense of other considerations,\u201d Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research, said in an email.  New reports of bugs and breaches raise the likelihood that governments will add regulations on Facebook, said George Salmon, an analyst with Hargreaves Lansdown.  \u201cFacebook is sensibly trying hard to regain the trust of its user base, but all that effort will be to no avail if stories like this keep emerging,\u201d Salmon said.  The bug affected users who give third-party applications permission to access their photos.  Facebook typically only grants such apps access to photos shared on a user\u2019s timeline, but the bug potentially gave developers access to other photos, including ones that were uploaded but not posted, and ones shared on Marketplace and Facebook Stories, the company said.","738":"PALO ALTO (Reuters) - Social media companies are under close scrutiny over their handling of misinformation and threats of violence tied to the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden on Wednesday, amid conflicting signals in far-right forums about possible attacks.

Facebook also re-introduced a measure used after the presidential election that gives added weight in its news feed algorithm to publishers considered authoritative, based on an internal \u201cnews ecosystem quality\u201d scoring system.  Other temporary changes include blocks on the ability of people who have repeatedly violated policies to create events, groups, pages and live videos, as well as stepped-up requirements for users running groups to pre-approve posts.  On Saturday, Facebook said it would prohibit ads for weapon accessories like gun holsters and vests until at least two days after the inauguration, although researchers have spotted such ads even after the ban.  The company suspended Trump at least through Inauguration Day, saying he used Facebook to \u201cincite violent insurrection,\u201d and has no plans to lift the ban even after that.  TWITTER  After the Capitol unrest, Twitter announced steps to limit amplification of tweets violating its election misinformation rules, blocking likes, replies and retweets of those messages.  Users can still quote the tweets, but must add their own comments before sharing, it said.  The company also updated its \u201ccivic integrity\u201d policy to establish a strike-based enforcement system for misleading election claims and purged more than 70,000 accounts for sharing QAnon content.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  A Twitter spokeswoman declined to say whether the company was restricting automated content recommendations, such as suggestions for users to follow, or to disclose specific terms being blocked from appearing in \u201ctrending\u201d topics.  On Inauguration Day, Twitter will transfer control of official White House accounts like @WhiteHouse and @POTUS to the Biden administration.  The company permanently suspended Trump\u2019s personal account @realDonaldTrump, citing the risk of further incitement. That account had been his primary megaphone throughout his presidency.  YOUTUBE  YouTube, Alphabet Inc\u2019s video streaming platform, said it has put in place \u201cadditional protective measures\u201d for Inauguration Day, without elaborating.  The company bars live videos that show someone using a firearm, but declined to say whether it was imposing any further restrictions on livestreams or making temporary changes to its systems for recommending content.

A static version of its website returned on Jan. 15 with the help of a Russian-owned technology company and has featured a handful of posts by executives and others, including Fox News host Mark Levin.  Jeffrey Wernick, Parler\u2019s chief operating officer, told Reuters the company was posting those comments on behalf of \u201cfriends who reached out\u201d and had not yet put in place any new content guidelines.  DLIVE  Niche video streaming platform DLive, in the spotlight after far-right personalities used it to broadcast live during the Capitol siege, said it would block all live streams from Washington, D.C. on Jan. 20.  The company, popular with video game streamers, also started proactively reviewing content in the non-gaming \u201cX-tag\u201d section of its site and halted the ability of streamers there to earn money off their videos, it said.  TWITCH  Amazon\u2019s livestreaming platform declined to disclose whether it had put in place any specific measures related to the inauguration.  The company said it removes content that incites or glorifies violence and was monitoring for policy violations. It has carried graphic livestreams of extremist violence before, including shootings in Germany in 2019.  Twitch disabled Trump\u2019s account indefinitely after the Capitol attack and said it would reassess the ban after he leaves office.  SNAPCHAT  Snap Inc maintains it faces fewer problems with extremism and incitement to violence than other platforms because of Snapchat\u2019s design: no open news feed, pre-approval for promoted content and limits on the size of group chats.  A spokeswoman said an internal team is conducting regular proactive sweeps for rules violations around the inauguration, but the platform is not making any other changes.  Snap permanently terminated Trump\u2019s account after the Capitol unrest, \u201cbased on his attempts to spread misinformation, hate speech, and incite violence.\u201d  REDDIT  Reddit did not respond to a request for comment on its plans for inauguration week.

They said technology companies had a compelling interest in learning how far federal authorities could go in forcing them to spy on users.  Though almost all of the underlying matter remains out of view, Reuters reported in 2018 that it turned on whether the Wiretap Act, which requires phone companies to help police listen to calls, could be used to make Facebook break the end-to-end encryption that protects voice calls placed over Facebook Messenger.  Prosecutors had asked Facebook be held in contempt of court for refusing an order to facilitate the tap, but the judge in the case declined. He would not publish his opinion saying why, and the appeals court upheld that decision on Wednesday.  The U.S. Justice Department had sought to keep the opinion secret, arguing that some continuing criminal investigations could be hurt. here  The appeals court said it did not have to decide whether such documents would ordinarily be made public because of the stronger right to protect investigations.  \u201cWe decline to consider whether there is a separate common law right of access to the documents, because any presumption in favor of access would be outweighed by a compelling government interest in maintaining secrecy in an ongoing investigation.\u201d the judges wrote.

The board, created by Facebook in response to criticism of its handling of problematic content, will initially have the power to review decisions to take down posts from Facebook and Instagram, and recommend policy changes.  Oversight Board member Alan Rusbridger told Reuters in an interview this week the board was now aiming for an October launch. A board spokesman said that the late launch, originally planned for last year, had been further slowed by the coronavirus pandemic.  Potential cases would come to the board from users who have exhausted the appeals process, or be sent over from Facebook. Deciding and implementing rulings would take up to 90 days, although Facebook could ask for them to be expedited within 30 days.  The Facebook spokeswoman said it was unlikely that cases related to the election would get through the process given that time frame.  Rusbridger also told Reuters that cases involving President Donald Trump\u2019s posts were not among those that the board had looked at in trial runs.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t done a Trump case,\u201d said Rusbridger, a former editor-in-chief of Britain\u2019s Guardian newspaper. \u201cWe have done a nudity case, we\u2019ve done a blasphemy case.\u201d  Facebook faced employee backlash in recent months over its decision to take no action over posts from Trump containing misleading claims about mail-in voting and inflammatory language about anti-racism protests.

Rusbridger declined to comment on Facebook\u2019s policy of exempting politicians\u2019 speech and ads from its third-party fact-checking program, though he said: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine we won\u2019t have a case brought to us on that.\u201d  \u2018WIDER RESONANCE\u2019  Since the first 20 members of the board were announced in May, they have had virtual meetings to discuss issues such as how to select cases and deal with minority opinions, Rusbridger said.  Rusbridger said the board would be looking for cases with \u201cwider resonance,\u201d though precedents set by decisions on individual posts would not be binding in future cases.  Facebook can also ask the board for policy recommendations though it does not have to act on them, a framework that was criticized by some U.S. Democratic lawmakers.  The board, which includes a former Danish prime minister, a Yemeni Nobel Peace Prize laureate, law experts and rights advocates from around the world, is expected to grow to a group of 40 members.  Rusbridger said the board was thinking about how it will select these candidates but was not yet choosing more members.","750":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc FB.O Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized on Wednesday for mistakes his company made in how it handled data belonging to 50 million of its users, and promised tougher steps to restrict developers' access to such information.  The world\u2019s largest social media network is facing growing government scrutiny in Europe and the United States. This follows allegations by a whistleblower that British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed users\u2019 information to build profiles on American voters that were later used to help elect U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016.  \u201cThis was a major breach of trust. I\u2019m really sorry this happened. We have a basic responsibility to protect people\u2019s data,\u201d Zuckerberg told CNN, breaking a public silence since the scandal erupted at the weekend.  Zuckerberg said in a post on Facebook the company \"made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.\" (bit.ly\/2DHAlUJ)  He said the social network planned to conduct an investigation of thousands of apps that have used Facebook\u2019s platform, restrict developer access to data, and give members a tool that lets them disable access to their Facebook data more easily.  His plans did not represent a big reduction of advertisers\u2019 ability to use Facebook data, which is the company\u2019s lifeblood.  European governments expressed dissatisfaction with Facebook\u2019s response and said the scandal showed the need for strong regulation.  \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be for a company to decide what is the appropriate balance between privacy and innovation and use of data. Those rules should be set by society as a whole and so by parliament,\u201d British minister for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Matt Hancock, told BBC Radio. \u201cThe big tech companies need to abide by the law and we\u2019re strengthening the law.\u201d  Germany\u2019s justice minister Katarina Barley demanded that Facebook executives explain to her whether the site\u2019s 30 million German users had been affected.  Zuckerberg said he was open to additional government regulation and happy to testify before the U.S. Congress if he was the right person.  \u201cI\u2019m not sure we shouldn\u2019t be regulated,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI actually think the question is more what is the right regulation rather than yes or no, should it be regulated? ... People should know who is buying the ads that they see on Facebook.\u201d  Zuckerberg said Facebook was committed to stopping interference in the U.S. midterm election in November and elections in India and Brazil.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  INVESTOR FEARS  Facebook shares fell 1.5 percent in premarket trading on Thursday as the apology failed to quell Wall Street nerves.  The company has lost nearly $46 billion of its stock market value over the past three days on investors\u2019 fears that any failure by big tech firms to protect personal data could deter advertisers and users and invite tougher regulation.  Zuckerberg told the New York Times in an interview published on Wednesday he had not seen a \u201cmeaningful number of people\u201d deleting their accounts over the scandal.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Facebook representatives met U.S. congressional staff on Wednesday and planned to continue meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday. Facebook was unable to answer many questions, two aides who attended the briefing said.  Zuckerberg told the website Recode that fixes to protect users' data would cost \"many millions of dollars.\" (bit.ly\/2IJbYJS)  The whistleblower who launched the scandal, Christopher Wylie, formerly of Cambridge Analytica, said on Twitter he had accepted invitations to testify before U.S. and UK lawmakers.  \u2018SCAPEGOAT\u2019  On Tuesday, the board of Cambridge Analytica suspended its Chief Executive Alexander Nix, who was caught in a secret recording boasting that his company played a decisive role in Trump\u2019s victory.  Psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who provided the data, dismissed on Wednesday Cambridge Analytica\u2019s assertions that the information was \u201cincredibly accurate\u201d.  Kogan, who gathered the data by running a survey app on Facebook, also said he was being made a scapegoat by the social media firm and Cambridge Analytica. Both companies have blamed Kogan for alleged data misuse.  About 300,000 Facebook users responded to Kogan\u2019s quiz, but that gave the researcher access to those people\u2019s Facebook friends as well, who had not agreed to share information, producing details on 50 million users.  Facebook has said it subsequently made changes that prevent people from sharing data about friends and maintains that no breach occurred because the original users gave permission. Critics say that it essentially was a breach because data of unsuspecting friends was taken.  Analysts say the incident may reduce user engagement with Facebook, lessening its clout with advertisers. Three Wall Street brokerages cut their price targets.","751":"March 14 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc Chief Product Officer Chris Cox will leave the social media network, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said in a blog post on Thursday.

The company does not immediately plan to appoint anyone to fill Cox\u2019s role in the near term, he said. (Reporting by Tamara Mathias in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)","752":"MENLO PARK, Calif.\/BOSTON (Reuters) - Protesters carrying an inflatable angry emoji greeted Facebook Inc shareholders as they gathered for the company\u2019s annual meeting on Thursday, the latest sign of its struggle to shake off privacy scandals and rein in fake news and hate speech.  The social media giant again faced demands for reform at Thursday\u2019s meeting, including shareholder proposals that called for revamping the company\u2019s voting structure and ousting Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg as chairman.  The measures had little chance of succeeding, as a dual class share structure gives Zuckerberg and other insiders control of about 58% of the votes. Many investors have shrugged off the scandals swirling around the company, as it has beaten Wall Street\u2019s estimates for revenue growth and continues to add users globally.  Zuckerberg declined to answer a shareholder question on why he would not agree to create an independent board chair, instead restating his view that regulators should set the rules for companies around privacy and content.  But even though the votes are largely symbolic, they are still seen as a useful barometer of investor sentiment about how well the social media icon is coping with unprecedented challenges to its hands-off approach to content.  Last year, about 83% of shares held by outside investors voted for a proposal that would have the company move to a structure of one vote per share and do away with the supermajority shares.  A coalition of activist groups have urged big investors to reject Zuckerberg\u2019s nomination to the board this year, saying Facebook has failed to protect users, especially racial and religious minorities.  Outside the hotel, a small group of protesters filmed themselves hoisting the 8-foot (2.5-meter) red emoji balloon, saying the company failed to protect its users, particularly minorities, from hate speech and other abuses.  \u201cZuckerberg has said that he wants to protect people from white supremacy but there\u2019s still a ton of white supremacists organizing on Facebook,\u201d said Leila Deen, program director for SumOfUs, the group in the coalition responsible for the balloon.  Slideshow ( 14 images )  Nearby, an opposing protester in a red hat stamped with \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d a slogan of U.S. President Donald Trump, used a loudspeaker to accuse Facebook of censoring conservatives.  The coalition, led by consumer group Majority Action and civil rights advocate Color of Change, said they had gathered 125,000 signatures on a petition targeting BlackRock Inc, one of Facebook\u2019s biggest outside investors.  BlackRock\u2019s funds backed all of Facebook\u2019s director nominees last year, but also voted for two shareholder proposals that would have reorganized Facebook\u2019s governance structure.  It declined to comment on the petition, with a spokesman saying it did not preview votes or comment on specific companies.  Other shareholders in the meeting said the company created a \u201chostile work environment\u201d for people with conservative views and pressed for a diversity report reflecting its public policy positions.  UNDER SCRUTINY  Facebook has been under scrutiny from regulators and shareholders since last year, when reporting revealed that the data of some 87 million users had been shared with now-defunct political data firm Cambridge Analytica.  The company has also come under fire over Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, which used social media to spread disinformation, and its frequently shifting policies around which content is permitted on its platform.  Slideshow ( 14 images )  U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized the company on Wednesday, saying she was no longer willing to give Facebook the benefit of the doubt on Russia after it refused to remove a heavily edited video that attempted to make her look incoherent.  \u201cI thought it was unwittingly, but clearly they wittingly were accomplices and enablers of false information to go across Facebook,\u201d she said.  The comments raise the specter of harsher action in Congress against Facebook. Pelosi has previously warned that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields tech companies from legal liability for content created by their users, was a \u201cgift\u201d that had been abused and could be reconsidered.  Investors do not seem worried.  The company\u2019s stock jumped 10 percent after its last earnings report, even as it announced it was setting aside up to $5 billion for what could be the largest civil penalty ever paid to the Federal Trade Commission, which has been investigating Facebook over alleged privacy violations.  One of Facebook\u2019s largest fund investors, William Danoff of the $123 billion Fidelity Contrafund, did not mention any of Facebook\u2019s privacy issues in his most in his most recent quarterly commentary to investors.  He wrote only that, as his portfolio\u2019s second-largest holding, Facebook \u201cappeals to us based on growth in its various apps and revenue from advertisers that want to reach the firm\u2019s enormous base of daily active users.\u201d  Danoff has been a long-time backer of Facebook and previously indicated he was satisfied with the company\u2019s reform efforts to date.  Among other top Facebook investors, last year Vanguard Group Inc withheld support from Zuckerberg and Sandberg, and backed a measure to reform Facebook\u2019s voting structure.","753":"FILE PHOTO: A Bitcoin logo is displayed at the Bitcoin Center New York City in New York's financial district, U.S. on July 28, 2015. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin\u2019s price dropped on Wednesday to its lowest level against the dollar since the middle of May after Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerbeg, in testimony before Congress, expressed doubts about whether the company\u2019s cryptocurrency project Libra was going to work.  Bitcoin's price on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange was last down 6.95% at $7,471 BTC=BTSP, after hitting a five-month low below $7,300.  Appearing before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, Zuckerberg admitted that he did not know if Libra would work. But he sought to reassure lawmakers that Facebook would not back any move by the crypto project, which comprises a consortium of 21 members including venture capital firms and nonprofits, to launch the digital currency until it had satisfied all U.S. regulatory concerns.  \u201cBitcoin quickly broke once Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony got started,\u201d said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York. \u201cRight now there\u2019s a growing sentiment that we may never see Libra live and that\u2019s just a potential setback for the entire crypto space.\u201d  Libra is intended to be a digital currency backed by a reserve of real-world assets, including bank deposits and short-term government securities, and held by a network of custodians. The structure is intended to foster trust and stabilize the price.  The plans have attracted intense scrutiny from regulators concerned about its impact on the financial system, user privacy and its potential for use in money laundering.  Aside from concerns about Libra, Charles Hayter, chief executive officer of CryptoCompare also pointed out that after an early upswing in the year that galvanized prices in the crypto sector, \u201cwe have seen weakening volumes and regulatory tightening from a number of jurisdictions.\u201d  Bitcoin has been on a downward trend since the second half of the year, plunging about 47% since late June.","754":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc\u2019s chief product officer and one of its earliest employees, Chris Cox, said on Thursday he is leaving the company just days after Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg revealed a plan to transform the world\u2019s biggest social network into an encryption-focused messaging company.  Cox, the 36-year-old Zuckerberg lieutenant who would have managed the CEO\u2019s vision to bring Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp closer together, said in a blog post that his departure came \u201cwith great sadness.\u201d He had left a graduate program at Stanford University to join Facebook in 2005 as a software engineer and helped developed its original news feed feature.  \u201cAs Mark has outlined, we are turning a new page in our product direction, focused on an encrypted, interoperable, messaging network ... This will be a big project and we will need leaders who are excited to see the new direction through,\u201d Cox said in a Facebook post.  Cox\u2019s departure removes a layer of management, bringing Zuckerberg closer to a family of apps that he wants to make compatible, in what technology analysts expect will be a complicated engineering task.  Shares of Facebook were down 1.7 percent in extended trading following the announcement.  Cox informed the company of his intention to resign on Monday, according to a regulatory filing on Thursday.  Also departing is WhatsApp Vice President Chris Daniels, adding to a string of recent high-profile exits from Facebook\u2019s product and communications teams. The shakeup is the second major management restructuring in as many years as the company also faces numerous government investigations across the world related to user privacy and fake news on its services.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Daniels had informed the company several months ago of his intention to leave and will stay on through a leadership transition, a person familiar with the matter said.  Zuckerberg told Wired magazine on March 6 that \u201cthere will be a bunch of work inside the company to make sure that we have the right folks in the right roles\u201d to bring Facebook\u2019s apps together and introduce more privacy features.  EMarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg said that \u201cwhenever there is a shift in strategy, it\u2019s not unusual to see some personnel changes.\u201d  NEW STRUCTURE  Will Cathcart, vice president of product management, will now lead WhatsApp, and Head of Video, Games and Monetization Fidji Simo will be the new head of the Facebook app, Zuckerberg said.  Cathcart and Simo worked closely to bring video uploading tools and professional video content to Facebook. And growing viewership and advertising on videos are of growing importance to both the Facebook and WhatsApp apps.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The company does not immediately plan to fill Cox\u2019s role, Zuckerberg said, adding that Cathcart, Simo and the heads of Instagram and Messenger will now report directly to him.  Facebook\u2019s family of apps strategy has so far been led jointly by Cox and Javier Olivan, vice president of growth.  Zuckerberg said on Thursday that Olivan will now lead the effort to integrate Facebook apps, a key move as the company encrypts conversations on more of its messaging services and makes them compatible.  Cox gained greater oversight of WhatsApp and Instagram following the exits of their founders over the last two years. He also remained a key figure at Facebook, where for years until Monday he spoke at the orientations for new employees.  Daniels, who had worked on Facebook initiatives in developing countries, had moved a year ago to WhatsApp, which is more popular than Facebook in many big emerging markets.  A WhatsApp spokesman declined to comment on Daniels\u2019 departure or make him available for comment.  Zuckerberg still has a number of long-time product and engineering lieutenants. They include hardware Vice President Andrew Bosworth, who joined shortly after Cox, as well as decade-long veterans Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer and engineering Vice President Jay Parikh.","755":"Multiple Facebook posts (here, here), some with thousands of shares (here, here) as of April 6, 2020, claim that customers of Nordic bank Danske Bank are the target of a sophisticated scam to steal their money.

WhatsApp, the free text-messaging service owned by social media platform Facebook, is ubiquitous throughout Mexico. Superama shoppers can text an order to a WhatsApp number run by Walmart, known in Mexico as Walmart de Mexico.  A Reuters reporter tried the service on Monday, sending a photo of a handwritten grocery list. A company representative responded immediately, punctuating responses with smiley-face and winky-face emojis.  The representative said Superama charges 49 pesos ($2.55) for delivery within 90 minutes, or 39 pesos ($2.03) for a later delivery time, and would accept payment in cash or by card upon delivery.  Superama represents about 92 of Walmart\u2019s 2,459 stores in Mexico, which is the U.S. retailer\u2019s largest overseas market by store count. Superama already takes orders via its website and a Superama app, as well as through Cornershop, a third-party delivery app that sells goods for a variety of other stores.

FILE PHOTO: The logos of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are seen in a combination photo from Reuters files. REUTERS\/File Photos -\/File Photo  Legislators also demanded explanations from Apple Inc about charges for apps and in-app purchases, Facebook Inc for its rapidly changing privacy policy and Alphabet\u2019s Google over whether its rivals are demoted in search results.  The committee does not have authority to punish the companies, and any effort to change antitrust laws affecting tech firms would face hurdles in the Republican-controlled Senate. So the questioning served largely to convey the panel\u2019s displeasure over many of the companies\u2019 business practices.  Representative David Cicilline, chair of the antitrust committee, pressed Nate Sutton, an associate general counsel at Amazon, about allegations that the online retailer used data about independent sellers on its platform to develop products to sell, thus competing against its own sellers.  \u201cYou said we do not consult data to compete with other sellers online. You do collect enormous data about prices, (and) what\u2019s popular,\u201d Cicilline said skeptically. \u201cYou\u2019re saying that you don\u2019t use that in any way to promote Amazon products?

Matt Perault, head of global policy development at Facebook, faced skepticism from Representative Hank Johnson of Georgia when Perault stressed Facebook\u2019s many social media competitors. \u201cI\u2019d like to know who this competition is,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not readily apparent.\u201d  Lawmakers did not ask about antitrust probes of the four companies under way at the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission.

Facebook\u2019s success has shaken Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, led by an Indian-born CEO, Sundar Pichai, who has made developing markets a priority.  Google officials in India earlier this year were alarmed to learn that Facebook Inc was likely to generate about $980 million in revenue in the country in 2018, according to one of the sources. Google\u2019s India revenues reached $1 billion only last year.  Facebook and Google declined to comment on Indian revenue figures or the competition between the two companies.  Google is now pushing back, attempting to lure customers with better ad-buying tools and more localized services. The revamped strategy mirrors initiatives that have succeeded in boosting the time Indian consumers spend with Google services.  The battle in India reflects an epic challenge for Google in developing markets around the world that are crucial to the company\u2019s long-term growth - many consumers in those country\u2019s are gravitating to Facebook and it\u2019s siblings, Instagram and WhatsApp, at the expense of Google search and YouTube, and advertising dollars are quick to follow.  \u201cFacebook is a far more user-friendly platform even though they haven\u2019t created features specifically for Indian advertisers,\u201d said Vikas Chawla, who runs a small ad-buying agency in India.  Facebook ads, compared with those on Google search or YouTube, tend to transcend language barriers more easily because they rely more on visual elements, said Narayan Murthy Ivaturi, vice president at FreakOut Pte Ltd, a Singapore-headquartered digital marketing firm. Pinpointing younger consumers and rural populations is easier with Facebook and its Instagram app, he and other ad buyers said.  And Facebook is succeeding in India, which boasts the fastest-growing digital ad market of any major economy, despite internal turmoil and political controversy. It has been without a country head for the last year, and has faced a series of incidents in which rumors circulating on Facebook and WhatsApp have prompted mob violence.  Facebook and Google between them took 68 percent of India\u2019s digital ad market last year, according to advertising buyer Magna. Media agency GroupM estimates digital advertising spending will grow 30 percent in India this year.  The Facebook phenomenon is evident close to home for Google. During a recent lunch period, six out of 10 people who walked out of Google\u2019s Bangalore offices while looking at their phones told Reuters they were checking WhatsApp. All 10 said they regularly used Whatsapp.  Eight Indian ad buyers interviewed by Reuters were divided on whether Facebook would overtake Google in Indian ad revenue. That such a question would even be debated explains why Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, has pressed to flip the company\u2019s approach to emerging markets.  \u201cIndia is the most important market for the \u2018Next Billion Users\u2019 initiative,\u201d Caesar Sengupta, the head of the effort, told Reuters on the sidelines of the annual \u201cGoogle for India\u201d event in New Delhi last week.  NEW TACTICS  For many years Google designed its services for early adopters of new technology, who tended to be in Silicon Valley, said Nelson Mattos, who oversaw Google\u2019s Europe and Africa operations for several years. Great products would then find a broad global audience.  \u201cOver time, as you saw the growth of Facebook, the importance of WhatsApp and other tools in these new markets, and not the same adoption of Google, the company started to realize that maybe they had to change that approach,\u201d Mattos said.  Shortly after taking the helm three years ago, Pichai mapped a new strategy for places such as India: More services tailored to locals; more marketing on radio, billboards and TV; more local staff and start-up investment.  Google\u2019s India workforce has more than doubled since to more than 4,000 employees, or about eight times Facebook\u2019s presence, according to a tally of LinkedIn profiles and company statements.  Its products evolved too, becoming easier to use with low data plans. Smartphone apps such as Files Go and Tez - rebranded last week as Google Pay - were aimed at Indians.  \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a sea change,\u201d said Asif Baki, a user researcher at Google who oversees two-week \u201cimmersion trips\u201d in developing markets for senior executives and staff.  The efforts are bearing fruit. Indian users during the first half of this year spent more time on Google services than on Facebook services, according to estimates from audience measurement firm Comscore. Over a similar period a year ago, Facebook came out on top.  Extending those gains to the ad business is a work in progress. A handful of Google executives, including leaders for display ads and small business advertisers, traveled to India earlier this year in a previously unreported trip to better understand the needs of Indian clients.  The visit spurred them to consider ideas such as enabling advertisers to reach users only in a particular Indian state, since language and literacy vary greatly around the country, according to a person familiar with the discussions.  At the New Delhi event, Google unveiled a plan to bring Indian newspaper content online, to increase the supply of search results - and ads - available in regional languages.  Google still has to reckon with other issues. Small businesses in emerging markets are less likely to have websites, a foundation for Google ad campaigns but unnecessary for Facebook.  Executives met with one Indian merchant who recorded product videos on YouTube then messaged the links to potential customers on WhatsApp, said Kim Spalding, the company\u2019s general manager and product lead for small business ads.  Facebook, meanwhile, is already on to commercializing such behavior. Just weeks ago, it began charging for text-based marketing features on WhatsApp, with video ads expected to launch next year.

FILE PHOTO: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg listens while testifying before a joint Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committees hearing regarding the company\u2019s use and protection of user data, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., April 10, 2018. REUTERS\/Leah Millis\/File Photo  The bipartisan criticism reflected rising frustration in Congress about how Facebook protects the privacy of the more than 2 billion people who use its services worldwide.  The leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee accused Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg of failing to disclose the company\u2019s agreements with the Chinese firms when he appeared before them in April and testified about Facebook\u2019s sharing of users\u2019 personal information with third parties.  \u201cClearly, the company\u2019s partnerships with Chinese technology companies and others should have been disclosed before Congress and the American people,\u201d the panel\u2019s Republican chairman, Greg Walden, and top Democrat Frank Pallone said in a statement.  \u201cWe strongly encourage full transparency from Facebook and the entire tech community,\u201d they wrote.  Facebook responded that Zuckerberg spent more than 10 hours responding to lawmakers\u2019 questions.  \u201cThe arrangements in question had been highly visible for years - with many manufacturers advertising these features. But with fewer and fewer people relying on them, we proactively announced this spring we\u2019d begin winding them down,\u201d the company said in a statement.  Facebook has said that the contracts with smartphone maker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] and other Chinese firms were standard industry practice and necessary to ensure that people who bought electronic devices had ready access to Facebook services.  Facebook said it had control over the data sharing all along and that other tech firms struck similar arrangements with U.S. and Chinese companies in the early days of smartphones.  Facebook shares closed down nearly 1 percent in New York.  On Tuesday, Facebook said Huawei, computer maker Lenovo Group and smartphone makers OPPO and TCL Corp were among about 60 companies worldwide that received access to some user data after they signed contracts to re-create Facebook-like experiences for their users.  Huawei, the world\u2019s third-largest smartphone maker, has come under scrutiny from U.S. intelligence agencies that have said that Chinese telecommunications companies provide an opportunity for foreign espionage and threaten critical U.S. infrastructure, something the Chinese have denied.  Huawei said in a statement, \u201cLike all leading smartphone providers, Huawei worked with Facebook to make Facebook\u2019s service more convenient for users. Huawei has never collected or stored any Facebook user data.\u201d  Francisco Varela, Facebook\u2019s vice president of mobile partnerships, said on Tuesday the user data in question was stored on people\u2019s devices, not on Huawei\u2019s company servers.  Senator Ed Markey, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter, \u201cMark Zuckerberg needs to return to Congress and testify why @facebook shared Americans\u2019 private information with questionable Chinese companies.\u201d  Republican Senator Marco Rubio asked on Twitter, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t @facebook just reveal this data sharing deal with #Huawei months ago? And don\u2019t compare this to deals with other telecomms. S.Korea govt doesnt control or use @Samsung the way China controls & uses Huawei.\u201d  A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman had no comment.  Lawmakers expressed concern after The New York Times reported that the data of users\u2019 friends could have been accessed without their explicit consent. Facebook denied that, and said the data access was to allow its users to access account features on mobile devices.  The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which reached a settlement with Facebook in 2011 over its information-sharing practices, declined comment.  In a separate letter on Tuesday, the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee pressed Facebook for more information, while the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s top Democrat urged Facebook to release further details. Facebook said it would address the commerce panel\u2019s questions.  Congressional aides have said Facebook has not answered hundreds of questions from lawmakers after Zuckerberg\u2019s April testimony before two committees. Several aides said lawmakers were waiting for Facebook\u2019s answers before deciding on whether to hold additional hearings.  Facebook has said that other companies that have used its data sharing include Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, HTC Corp, Microsoft Corp and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.  Several countries are scrutinizing Facebook after it failed to protect the data of some 87 million users that was shared with now-defunct political data firm Cambridge Analytica.","764":"Oct 6 (Reuters) -  * FACEBOOK REMOVES TRUMP POST FALSELY SAYING FLU IS MORE LETHAL THAN COVID - CNN Source text : cnn.it\/3nqk9iz Further company coverage:","765":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The lawsuits filed against Facebook allege the company\u2019s pattern of buying up competitors has turned it into a monopoly, but several experts said the complaints fell short on explaining how the social media platform\u2019s actions have hurt consumers.  FILE PHOTO: An illustration photo shows the Facebook page displayed on a mobile phone internet browser held in front of a computer screen at a cyber-cafe in downtown Nairobi, Kenya April 18, 2019. REUTERS\/Stringer  The U.S. Federal Trade Commission and nearly every U.S. state filed lawsuits against the social media company on Wednesday - making Facebook the second big tech company to face a major legal challenge this year after the U.S. Justice Department sued Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google in October.  Stephen Yelderman, a professor at Notre Dame law school and a former trial attorney at the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, said the lawsuits lack compelling examples of consumer harm. \u201cI think if they had great stories about such harm, they definitely would have featured those,\u201d he added.  Yelderman and other antitrust experts said that as the case proceeds the agency and states will call economic and market experts to testify about the harms they say are caused by Facebook, even as such examples were largely missing from the initial complaints.  Newer legal theories are taking a broader approach to what may constitute harm given the big changes in how consumers interact with and can be impacted by companies.  The lawsuits against Facebook allege the social media platform\u2019s conduct around its acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 was anti-competitive and that those mergers must be unwound.  Some experts said it would be a challenge to argue an antitrust case retrospectively, and that it is easier to establish that an acquisition would cause consumers harm before a merger is approved.  Andrew Gavil, a professor at Howard University School of Law, cited a landmark case against Microsoft in 1998, in which U.S. regulators struggled to define harm to consumers and went instead with the theory that Microsoft\u2019s conduct had prevented future competition - helping the company eventually avoid a forced breakup.  \u201cThe Facebook lawsuits can be hard to prove because you have to persuade the court that the inference of that kind of harm is strong based on the conduct,\u201d Gavil said.  \u2018THEY DON\u2019T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE\u2019  A source familiar with Facebook\u2019s thinking also told Reuters the idea of whether the company\u2019s actions have caused consumers harm \u201cwill be at the core of this litigation.\u201d  \u201c(Regulators) wave their hands at this a little bit and say there might have been more choice and other options for people but they don\u2019t have any evidence that suggests ... that \u2018but for\u2019 (Facebook) the world will be more competitive,\u201d the source said.  Facebook has called the lawsuits \u201crevisionist history\u201d and will continue making that a part of its defense, the source said.  On Thursday, Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told employees during a Q&A that the company faces vigorous competition, according to audio of the meeting reviewed by Reuters.  Some antitrust experts have pushed back against the idea of seeking to prove harm to consumers and argued that new antitrust lawsuits must focus on a much broader definition of harm.  This idea has found increasing support in Washington. A House panel released a wide-ranging report on tech companies earlier this year in which it called for establishing a legal standard \u201cdesigned to protect not just consumers, but also workers, entrepreneurs, independent businesses, open markets, a fair economy, and democratic ideals.\u201d  Sarah Miller, executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, a Washington-based group focused on monopolies, said it is illegal to foreclose competition or acquire rivals to maintain monopoly power.  \u201cPoor content, more misinformation and disinformation, poor privacy protections ... the lawsuits make a clear case about the harms caused by the lack of competition,\u201d she said.","766":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook Inc FB.O, Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O and Twitter Inc TWTR.N told a U.S. House panel on Tuesday that the social media companies are not discriminating against content for political reasons.

House Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican, said that since an April hearing, Congress has \u201cseen numerous efforts by these companies to improve transparency,\u201d but he also pointed to anecdotes of some content being removed.  Goodlatte asked if these companies are \u201cusing their market power to push the envelope on filtering decisions to favor the content the companies prefer?\u201d  Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat, blasted the hearing and said Facebook for two years has \u201cbent over backwards to placate and mollify conservatives,\u201d and pointed to Facebook\u2019s failure to remove pages promoting unsubstantiated conspiracy theories.  \u201cThere is no evidence that the algorithms of social networks or search results are biased against conservatives.

Representative Jerrold Nadler, the top Democrat on the committee, unsuccessfully asked the panel to adjourn to a private session to discuss Russia.  Juniper Downs, global head of public policy and government relations at Google\u2019s video channel YouTube, said the company does not discriminate against conservatives. \u201cGiving preference to content of one political ideology over another would fundamentally conflict with our goal of providing services that work for everyone,\u201d she said.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The sharp decline in the use of cash and the prospect of Facebook\u2019s 2.5 billion users adopting its currency Libra has led central banks to examine how they can issue their own forms of digital currency.  Twenty-four thousand digital tokens dubbed LBCOINs and based on blockchain technology will go on pre-sale next week, each with an attached portrait of one of the 20 people who signed Lithuania\u2019s declaration of independence in 1918.  \u201cNo one in the central bank community was thinking about digital currency seriously before we realized that there is a legitimate threat that someone else will take our space,\u201d said Marius Jurgilas, deputy governor of Lithuania\u2019 central bank.  \u201cWe need to provide society with what it wants,\u201d he added.  The LBCOIN is very similar to what is known as a central bank digital currency (CBDC), said Jurgilas, putting Lithuania at the forefront of development of a fiat digital currencies.  CBDCs are traditional money in digital form, issued and governed by a country\u2019s central bank. By contrast, cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are produced by solving complex maths puzzles, and governed by disparate online communities instead of a centralized body.  \u201cAt a time when central banks are beginning to change their thinking on digital currency, LBCOIN is probably the most advanced experimental playground to test different reincarnations of the CBDCs,\u201d said Jurgilas.  The digital tokens will be sold in packs of six for 99 euros. The central bank expects users to trade them with others to build a specific set that can then be exchanged for a credit card-sized physical silver coin with a nominal worth of 19.18 euros.  LBCOINs can be exchanged directly with the central bank and on private blockchain networks.  CBDCs could change the role of commercial banks - which currently host all electronic accounts for the customers funds- when it comes to processing payments, Jurgilas said.  \u201cAt the moment, the only way to hold central bank-issued money is to hold the physical cash,\u201d he said.  The novel coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the development of CBDCs as it has prompted millions of people to turn to cashless payments, central bank officials said in June.  Central banks will introduce CBDCs carefully to avoid fragmenting the financial and monetary system, Benoit Coeure, head of the Innovation Hub at the Bank for International Settlements, said in June.","776":"WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - U.S. payments processor PayPal Holdings announced Friday it was withdrawing from the Libra Association, a Facebook-led effort to build a global digital currency.

The only tools Moscow currently has to enforce its data rules are fines that often amount to small sums or blocking the offending online service, an option fraught with technical difficulties.  Russia plans to impose stiffer fines on technology firms that fail to comply with its laws, sources familiar with the plans told Reuters in October.  Russia blocked access to LinkedIn in 2016 for not holding its Russian user data on servers in Russia. Last year it moved to block the Telegram instant messaging service, but the attempt failed and the service is still popular.  Facebook did not send a representative to the hearing on Friday, but the court pressed ahead anyway as Facebook did not seek for it to be postponed, the Interfax news agency cited the court as saying.  A court fined Twitter 3,000 roubles for a similar offense last week.  Russia has introduced tougher Internet laws in the last five years, requiring search engines to delete some search results and messaging services to share encryption keys with security services.  Russian authorities could gain new powers to block content in November when draft legislation that seeks to expand Russia\u2019s sovereignty over its segment of the web could come into force.  The bill sailed through a second reading on Thursday in parliament and will become law if it is approved in a final reading, passed by the upper chamber and signed by President Vladimir Putin.","779":"En un supuesto tuit del 27 de octubre, replicado en una publicaci\u00f3n de Facebook, el expresidente de Bolivia Evo Morales habr\u00eda mostrado la intenci\u00f3n del futuro gobierno de Bolivia, encabezado por su correligionario Luis Arce, de imponer restricciones a las redes sociales y suprimir las compa\u00f1\u00edas privadas en el pa\u00eds andino.

It is the first time the wary tech giant has opened its doors in such a way, following months of criticism over how it decides what is racist, sexist or hate-fuelled and the methods used to remove illicit material shared on its platform.  Under the pilot, Macron\u2019s administration will send top civil servants to the company for six months from January, with the working group aiming to verify Facebook\u2019s goodwill and determine whether its checks and balances could be improved.  \u201cIt\u2019s a world first,\u201d an official working in the French presidency said last week. \u201cThere\u2019s a real risk for them.\u201d  \u201cThe idea is to make tests and then produce a report that we would intend to make public,\u201d the official added.  For Macron, who was speaking at the annual Internet Governance Forum in Paris on Monday, the move is an example of what he has called \u201csmart regulation\u201d, which he wants to roll out with tech leaders such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon -- referred to as the \u201cGAFAs\u201d in French.  The move follows a one-on-one meeting with Facebook\u2019s founder Mark Zuckerberg in May, when Macron invited the CEOs of some of the biggest tech firms to Paris, telling them that there was \u201cno free lunch\u201d and they should work for the common good.  The identity and number of French regulators that will take part in the project have not been revealed.  A source close to the French ministry for digital affairs indicated they could be seconded from the telecoms regulator and from the interior and justice ministries. Facebook said the selection was up to the French presidency.  It remains unclear whether the group will have access to highly-sensitive material such as Facebook\u2019s algorithms or dedicated codes to remove hate speech from the platform.  But the team could end up traveling to Facebook\u2019s European headquarters in Dublin and to Menlo Park, California, where the parent-company is based if necessary, the company said.  France\u2019s approach to the fight against hate speech has contrasted sharply with that chosen by Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy and a leading advocate of privacy.  Since January, Berlin has required sites to remove banned content within 24 hours or face fines of up to 50 million euros ($56 million). That has led to a perverse situation in which a lot of the removed content is later determined to have been legal, the Elysee said.  Instead France is adopting a more nuanced approach, based on collaboration between private companies and embedded regulators, modelled on what happens in the banking and nuclear industries.  \u201c(Tech companies) now have the choice between something that is smart but intrusive and regulation that is wicked and plain stupid,\u201d a French official said.

Disney joins other companies like Starbucks Corp SBUX.O, Unilever Plc ULVR.L, Adidas AG ADSGn.DE and others that have pulled advertising from the tech giant.  The time frame for Disney\u2019s pullback wasn\u2019t clear as some brands paused their ad spending for longer stretches, the report said, adding that Disney didn\u2019t make a public announcement that it was cutting back on Facebook but shifted advertising plans silently.  Disney has paused advertising of its streaming video service Disney+ on Facebook as the company is concerned about Facebook\u2019s enforcement of its policies surrounding objectionable content, the report said.  The company has also paused ad spending on Facebook-owned Instagram for its another streaming service called Hulu, the report added.  \u201cWe know we have more work to do, and we\u2019ll continue to work with civil rights groups ... and other experts to develop even more tools, technology and policies to continue this fight,\u201d a Facebook representative said in an email statement.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Apple is seen at a store in Zurich, Switzerland January 3, 2019. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  The move to give Apple prime placement is significant because users often select the default or top option on apps. And Apple will require apps to offer its button if they want to offer options to login with Facebook or Google.  Apple unveiled its login button on Monday, emphasizing users\u2019 privacy and also introducing a feature that randomly generates an email address to avoid revealing the person\u2019s true email.  Many consumers choose to sign in to independent apps using their accounts from Google or Facebook because it saves the trouble of having to create and remember separate user names and passwords for dozens of different apps.  But the login buttons can send some data back to their makers about the user\u2019s app habits. Apple\u2019s software chief Craig Federighi said during a keynote address on Monday that Apple was seeking to give users a more private option and developers a way to offer a fast one-step login without sending their user\u2019s data to another company.  In a press release about updates to its App Store review guidelines, Apple said its login button \u201cwill be required as an option for users in apps that support third-party sign-in when it is commercially available later this year.\u201d  Apple\u2019s guidelines do not appear to impose requirements on apps that have their own dedicated login system and do not use third-party buttons from Google or Facebook, such as apps from game maker Nintendo Co Ltd. Apple\u2019s button also works on websites. Its use will not be required because Apple does not hold review power over websites the way it does apps on its own store, but Apple\u2019s guidelines still ask it to be given top placement if it is used.  Apple declined to comment further beyond its executives\u2019 public remarks on Sign in with Apple. Facebook and Google declined to comment on the move, though Google said it does not require use of Google\u2019s login button for apps in its Play Store on Android devices.  Apple\u2019s suggestion to developers to place its login button above rival buttons is part of its \u201cHuman Interface Guidelines,\u201d which are not formal requirements to pass App Store review. But many developers believe that following them is the surest way to gain approval.  Apple\u2019s guidelines to developers around login tools come as developers and rivals have alleged that some of its App Store practices, such as taking a commission of up to 30% of sales made through the store, are anticompetitive.  United States antitrust regulators are also laying the ground for a potential antitrust review of Apple and other major technology companies, Reuters reported Monday. In an interview with CBS News that aired on Tuesday, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said it was \u201cfair\u201d for regulators to scrutinize Apple given its size but said the company is not a monopoly in any of the markets it operates in.","784":"April 25 (Reuters) - New York Attorney General Letitia James said on Thursday she is investigating Facebook Inc\u2019s unauthorized collection of up to 1.5 million Facebook users\u2019 email contact databases, the latest issue involving the privacy of the company\u2019s users.

That project has been called into doubt of late, as several high-profile companies dropped out of efforts to help establish the currency.  David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the currency project, remained confident on Wednesday that the project will attract more backers as regulatory concerns are addressed.  But Brainard said Libra backers have yet to address several major regulatory questions, including how they would ensure the currency is not used for illegal activities across borders. It also is unclear what protections or recourse consumers using the currency would have.  \u201cConsumers need to be cautioned that stablecoins are likely to be starkly different from sovereign-issued currency in legal terms,\u201d she said.  Brainard also said stablecoins like Libra could pose financial stability risks, as they could be subject to runs if not managed effectively.","787":"(Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's campaign published an open letter to Facebook FB.O Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday, calling for the company to fact-check politicians' ads in the two weeks ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November.  The letter also demanded that Facebook promptly remove false, viral information and that there be clear rules \u201capplied to everyone, including Donald Trump \u2014 that prohibit threatening behavior and lies about how to participate in the election.\u201d  In a blog post, Facebook said it would continue to protect political speech.  \u201cWe live in a democracy, where the elected officials decide the rules around campaigns,\u201d the company said.  The Biden campaign\u2019s move adds to pressure on Facebook, which exempts politicians\u2019 content from its third-party fact-checking program, to alter its rules on political ads and speech.  Zuckerberg last week promised a review of Facebook's content policies after the company faced backlash over taking no action on a post by Republican President Trump that was labeled by Twitter Inc TWTR.N for violating that company's rules on glorifying violence.  Twitter also for the first time last month used a fact-checking label on a tweet by Trump about mail-in ballots, causing him to accuse the company of censorship.  \u201cThe American people can think for themselves. They don\u2019t want big tech companies telling them how to think,\u201d said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for Trump campaign, in response to the Biden letter.  In its blog post, Facebook said: \u201cTwo weeks ago the President of the United States issued an executive order directing Federal agencies to prevent social media sites from engaging in activities like fact-checking political statements.  \u201cThis week, the Democratic candidate for President started a petition calling on us to do the exact opposite,\u201d it said, referring to an executive order that aimed to scrap or weaken a law that shields internet companies from liability for users\u2019 content.  Biden, who previously clashed with Facebook when it refused to take down a Trump ad he said contained false claims about his son Hunter\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, has also called for the law, known as Section 230, to be revoked.  On Thursday, the Biden campaign emailed supporters asking them to sign a petition for Facebook to crack down on misinformation in ads. It also used the hashtag #MOVEFASTFIXIT, a play on Facebook\u2019s early \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d motto.

Technology stocks, which have taken a beating in the past three weeks, were higher.  Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet, Netflix - collectively known as the \u201cFANG\u201d group - were up between 0.8 percent and 2.6 percent. Shares of Boeing, Caterpillar - hit the most on Wednesday after China retaliated with $50 billion in tariffs on U.S. goods such as soybeans, autos, chemicals and some types of aircraft - also rose more than 1 percent.

The Dow bounced back from a 500 point drop on Wednesday after President Donald Trump\u2019s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the administration was involved in a \u201cnegotiation\u201d with China rather than a trade war.  \u201cThe bounce on Wednesday was really quite impressive, especially as there was not much of a catalyst for the turnaround given that neither the U.S. or China is backing down on tariffs and negotiations were always going to take place in the background,\u201d Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda said in a note.  Investors also took comfort from the fact that the effective date of China\u2019s move depended on when the U.S. action took effect, providing room for maneuver.  Economic data on Thursday showed that the U.S. trade deficit increased to a near 9-1\/2-year high in February, but the shortfall with China narrowed sharply.  While exports to China were unchanged in February, imports from the country declined 14.7 percent.  Facebook shares were up about 3 percent after Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the company had not seen \u201cany meaningful impact\u201d on usage or ad sales since the data privacy scandal.

In seeking to derail the Irish regulator\u2019s decision, Facebook has said the mechanism in question, the Standard Contractual Clause (SCC), had been deemed valid by the Court of Justice of the European Union in July.  However, the July ruling also said that under SCCs, privacy watchdogs must suspend or prohibit transfers outside the EU if data protection in other countries cannot be assured.  The transatlantic argument stems from EU concerns that the surveillance regime in the United States may not respect the privacy rights of EU citizens when their personal data is sent to the United States for commercial use.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Plans for Libra, first floated by Facebook last year, were slimmed-down in April after regulators and central banks raised concerns it could upend financial stability, erode control over monetary policy and threaten privacy.  Tuesday\u2019s name switch is part of a move to emphasise a simpler, revamped structure, Stuart Levey, CEO of the Geneva-based Diem Association behind the planned digital coin, said.  \u201cThe original name was tied to an early iteration of the project that received a difficult reception from regulators. We have dramatically changed that proposition,\u201d Levey told Reuters.  Diem, which means \u201cday\u201d in Latin, now aims to initially launch a single dollar-backed digital coin, he added.  He declined to comment on timing for the launch, which the Financial Times reported last week could be as early as January, saying only that it would only go ahead after approval by the Swiss markets watchdog.  Facebook, which changed the name here of its payments unit Calibra to Novi Financial in May, remains one of 27 members of the Diem Association, formerly the Libra Association. Novi's head, David Marcus, is one of Diem's five board members.  \u201cThey are a critically-important member of the association,\u201d said Levey of Facebook\u2019s continuing involvement.  \u201cWe are not trying to cut all ties, by any stretch.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - The sudden new pessimism surrounding Facebook has overshot reality. Forecasts of reduced growth and margins wiped nearly 20 percent, or about $120 billion, off the social network\u2019s valuation overnight after it reported second-quarter earnings on Wednesday. That\u2019s an astonishing hit, and one of the largest dollar falls in a company\u2019s market capitalization ever. It\u2019s replacing excessive optimism with undue glumness.  Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s creation, now worth a bit over $500 billion, has a slew of problems. The number of users on its main site has plateaued in the United States and Europe. Constant stories about the mishandling of data, toxic content and state-sponsored misinformation also raise questions about the attractiveness of the platform for advertisers and users alike in the future.  Step back, however, and Facebook\u2019s new guidance isn\u2019t that bad. Revenue grew 42 percent in the last quarter from a year earlier, compared to a 49 percent pace of expansion in the first quarter. Interpreting the company\u2019s remarks, the growth rate could slow to below 30 percent by next year. That\u2019s about the same as Google parent Alphabet. Moreover, Facebook thinks operating margins will fall to around 35 percent within the next several years \u2013 still about 10 percentage points higher than its big internet rival.  After the plunge in its market capitalization, Facebook is now valued at about 27 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months, according to Thomson Reuters figures. The S&P 500 Index trades at nearer 17 times forecast earnings. Assume constant margins, and that implies Facebook will increase earnings a bit over 10 percentage points faster than the index for four years and subsequently at the same pace, by Breakingviews calculations.  Consider that a reasonable long-term guesstimate of S&P 500 earnings growth is under 10 percent a year \u2013 probably nearer 5 percent \u2013 and even factoring in a margin squeeze, Thursday\u2019s valuation for Facebook seems too conservative. Its main, eponymous platform may be maturing, but it also owns fast-growing Instagram, which has over 1 billion users, and WhatsApp, which has even more users as yet largely untapped for revenue.  The $870 billion Alphabet could be a still better bet. Its valuation multiple is just a smidge higher, yet earnings growth and margins remain buoyant. While Facebook is sorting itself out, Google might land more advertising business, too.","795":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Facebook is seen in Davos, Switzerland Januar 20, 2020.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said the task force would be led by Benoit Coeure, a European Central Bank board member.

No banks are yet part of the group.  Facebook\u2019s announcement drew a fast, worried reaction. The U.S. Senate Banking Committee said it would hold a hearing on the plans next month. David Marcus, who oversees Facebook\u2019s blockchain efforts, is expected to testify, according to a source in Washington familiar with the matter.  Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said Libra had to be safe or it would not happen, and that the world\u2019s major central banks would need to have oversight.  France, which holds the rotating presidency of the Group of Seven nations, has said it does not oppose Facebook\u2019s creating an instrument for financial transactions. But it adamantly opposes that instrument becoming a sovereign currency.  \u201cWe want to combine being open to innovation with firmness on regulation. This is in everyone\u2019s interest,\u201d Villeroy told finance industry officials.  The concept of a \u201cstable\u201d cryptocurrency still needs to be defined, Villeroy said. In particular, what such instruments are stable against and how fixed their exchange rates are need to be determined.  Villeroy also called for a network of national anti-money-laundering authorities, coordinated by the European Banking Authority, to carry out emergency measures and even substitute for national authorities, rather than creating a specializd European agency.  Several ECB officials, including Coeure, have argued in favor of creating such an agency over the past months.","798":"-- Source link: wapo.st\/2TIe9EN  -- Note: Reuters has not verified this story and does not vouch for its accuracy","799":"FILE PHOTO: A woman looks at the Facebook logo on an iPad in this photo illustration taken June 3, 2018.

The sweeping moves are the broadest actions yet by internet companies that previously have suspended or removed some of the conspiracy-driven content produced by Infowars.  Since founding Infowars in 1999, Jones has built a vast audience. Among the theories he has promoted is that the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington were staged by the government.

Alphabet and Apple did not immediately respond to questions about why the app remained available on their platforms.  Infowars editor-at-large Paul Joseph Watson said in a tweet here that the broad take-downs amounted to censorship and were intended to help Democrats in congressional elections due in November.

The Alex Jones Channel on YouTube on Monday displayed a banner saying the account had been terminated for violating community guidelines, and a spokesperson added by email that repeated violation of policies such as those prohibiting hate speech and harassment led to termination of accounts.  Apple deleted most Infowars podcasts and a spokeswoman said in a statement that the company \u201cdoes not tolerate hate speech\u201d and publishes guidelines that developers and publishers must follow.  \u201cPodcasts that violate these guidelines are removed from our directory making them no longer searchable or available for download or streaming,\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cWe believe in representing a wide range of views, so long as people are respectful to those with differing opinions.\u201d  Only one program provided by Infowars, \u201cRealNews with David Knight,\u201d remained on Apple\u2019s podcasts platforms on Monday.

If Infowars violates Twitter rules in the future, it will take action, it added.  Music and podcast company Spotify said on Monday that it had now removed all of Jones\u2019s Infowars programs from its platform, after last week removing some programs.  A representative said that Spotify took seriously reports of hate content. \u201cDue to repeated violations of Spotify\u2019s prohibited content policies, The Alex Jones Show has lost access to the Spotify platform,\u201d the representative said.  In late July, Facebook had suspended Jones\u2019s personal profile for 30 days for what the company said was bullying and hate speech.

The posts also allege that those with MTHFR gene mutations react aversely to vaccines, should not be administered Tylenol, and are more likely to have autism. These claims are false.  Reuters Fact Check. REUTERS\/Axel Schmidt  Examples of these viral claims can be found here , here , and here .  The MTHFR gene, which we all carry, provides instructions for making methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, an enzyme that helps process amino acids, the building blocks of proteins ( ghr.nlm.nih.gov\/gene\/MTHFR ). As explained by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), everyone carries two copies of MTHFR, which, like all genes, can vary. There are two common MTHFR gene variants: C677T and A1298C. For most individuals, the risk associated with these variants is so small that testing for them is not recommended ( here ).  Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 Committee on Infectious Diseases ( here ), told Reuters via phone that contrary to the claims in the posts, the presence of a \u201cstork bite\u201d (a common, usually temporary birthmark that is medically known as a nevus simplex), a \u201csugar bug\u201d (a blue vein across the bridge of the nose), and a sacral dimple (a small dent in the baby\u2019s lower back) are not MTHFR variant indicators.  The posts seek to sow worry over conditions that are largely not harmful. \u201cStork bites\u201d are common and benign, appearing on 30-50% of newborn babies. Over 95% \u201clighten and fade away completely.\u201d (here). \u201cSugar bugs\u201d are also \"perfectly normal\u201d and usually become less prominent or disappear altogether as babies grow (here).  Sacral dimples are rare (about 3-7% of babies are born with them) and, as stated here by the Cleveland Clinic, \u201cmost sacral dimples do not cause any health issues.\u201d In rare cases, the dimple may indicate an underlying spinal problem ( here ) . One such spinal problem is spinal bifida, a type of neural tube defect affecting an estimated 1 in 2,500 newborns globally ( here ). The condition, associated with vitamin B9 deficiency, can be caused by a MTHFR gene mutation, which may be the origin of the sacral dimple claim. O\u2019Leary explained that pediatricians are used to looking at sacral dimples, and that the process of assessing them does not include testing for this mutation.  More generally, some studies have linked MTHFR variants to a slightly increased risk of neural tube defects ( ghr.nlm.nih.gov\/gene\/MTHFR ). Dr. James L. Mills, a senior research scientist at the NIH\u2019s National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, told Reuters via email that one common variant in the gene, present in roughly 10-20% of the population, depending on racial background, is associated with poorer folate status (a type of B vitamin that helps the body produce red blood cells and keeps DNA healthy, see here ).  \u201cThis in turn can increase the risk for having a baby with a neural tube defect,\u201d he said. The risk, however, is \u201crelatively mild\u201d and can essentially be eliminated through supplement use. Co-authored by Mills, a 1997 study on the topic is available here .  In addition, since the U.S. Department of Agriculture began fortifying enriched grain products with B vitamin folic acid in 1998 ( here ), \u201cthe risk has become very small if it still is present at all,\u201d Mills said.  While rare, certain MTHFR variants may lead to higher levels of homocysteine, which can be a mild risk factor for certain health conditions, including blood clots ( here ). Dr. Mills emphasized, however, that elevated homocysteine levels are commonly linked to anemia, which can come from a host of factors\u2014genetic, dietary, chronic, or otherwise ( here ).  Preliminary studies ( here ) have found that homocysteine levels are higher in patients with untreated hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormones), which is among the host of conditions the posts attribute to MTHFR gene variants. Low thyroid function, in turn, can cause fatigue and metabolism issues, two conditions the posts also mention.  Dr. Mills confirmed that the posts\u2019 linking of MTHFR variants to depression, fibromyalgia, migraines, autism, infertility, IBS, ADD\/ADHD, migraines, autoimmune diseases, and cancer is baseless, and that those with the gene variant may safely take acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol or Tylenol.  Lastly, the posts suggest that a child with a MTHFR mutation should not be vaccinated. This claim may stem from a 2008 study\u2019s findings ( here ) that those with an MTHFR gene variant were at higher risk of adversely reacting to a smallpox vaccine.  As explained by Dr. O\u2019Leary, however, the smallpox vaccine, given today under rare circumstances, carries higher risk of adverse effects overall than the vaccines currently recommended for infants and children. Since smallpox was eradicated in 1980, routine immunization against the disease stopped among the general public, but continues for lab workers studying the virus that causes it ( here ).  O\u2019Leary says that these posts have taken information from the 2008 \u201csmall study\u201d out of context, wrongly \u201cextrapolating its findings to all childhood vaccines.\u201d  VERDICT  False. These birthmarks are largely normal and are not indicators of a MTHFR gene mutation. One study indicates that those with a MTHFR gene variant may be at higher risk of reacting aversely to a smallpox vaccine. Routine childhood vaccines and medications, however, are safe to use.

With the filing of the twin lawsuits on Wednesday, Facebook becomes the second big tech company to face a major legal challenge this year after the U.S. Justice Department sued Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google in October, accusing the $1 trillion company of using its market power to fend off rivals.  The lawsuits highlight the growing bipartisan consensus to hold Big Tech accountable for its business practices and mark a rare moment of agreement between the Trump administration and Democrats, some of whom have advocated breaking up both Google and Facebook.  The complaints on Wednesday accuse Facebook of buying up rivals, focusing specifically on its previous acquisitions of photo-sharing app Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and messaging app WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014.  Federal and state regulators said the acquisitions should be unwound - a move that is likely to set off a long legal challenge as the deals were cleared years earlier by the FTC.  \u201cFor nearly a decade, Facebook has used its dominance and monopoly power to crush smaller rivals, snuff out competition, all at the expense of everyday users,\u201d said New York Attorney General Letitia James on behalf of the coalition of 46 states, Washington, D.C. and Guam. Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and South Dakota did not participate in the lawsuit.  James said the company acquired rivals before they could threaten the company\u2019s dominance.  Facebook\u2019s general counsel Jennifer Newstead called the lawsuits \u201crevisionist history\u201d and said antitrust laws do not exist to punish \u201csuccessful companies.\u201d She said WhatsApp and Instagram have succeeded after Facebook invested billions of dollars in growing the apps.  \u201cThe government now wants a do-over, sending a chilling warning to American business that no sale is ever final,\u201d Newstead said.  Newstead also raised doubts about alleged harms caused by Facebook, arguing that consumers benefited from its decision to make WhatsApp free, and rivals like YouTube, Twitter and WeChat did \u201cjust fine\u201d without access to its developer platform.  In a post on Facebook\u2019s internal discussion platform, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told employees he did not anticipate \u201cany impact on individual teams or roles\u201d as a result of the lawsuits, which he said were \u201cone step in a process which could take years to play out in its entirety.\u201d  Comments were turned off for Zuckerberg\u2019s post, as well as for other posts on the lawsuits shared by Newstead and Chief Privacy Officer for Product Michel Protti, according to copies viewed by Reuters. Newstead also warned employees not to post about the cases.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Facebook did not immediately respond to questions about the posts.  PROTRACTED FIGHT  Zuckerberg told employees in July 2019 that Facebook would \u201cgo to the mat\u201d to fight a legal challenge to break up the company, calling it an \u201cexistential\u201d threat, according to audio of internal company meetings published by The Verge.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Although breakup remedies are rare, some antitrust experts said the case was unusually strong given damning statements by Zuckerberg plucked from Facebook\u2019s own documents, like a 2008 email in which he said \u201cit is better to buy than compete.\u201d  Other experts such as Seth Bloom of Bloom Strategic Counsel said the FTC complaint was \u201csignificantly weaker\u201d than the DOJ\u2019s lawsuit against Google.  \u201cWe\u2019re talking about acquisitions that are six or eight years old and it will be difficult for a court to order divestitures of many years ago,\u201d Bloom said.  Investors echoed similar concerns.  \u201cI do not know if the FTC or DOJ will be successful in breaking Facebook up. I\u2019m assuming this will be dragged out in the courts as FB defends itself,\u201d said Daniel Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust in Atlanta, Georgia.  The lawsuits are the biggest antitrust cases in a generation, comparable to the lawsuit against Microsoft Corp in 1998. The federal government eventually settled that case, but the yearslong court fight and extended scrutiny prevented the company from thwarting competitors and is credited with clearing the way for the explosive growth of the internet.  Last month, Facebook said it was buying customer service start-up Kustomer, in an acquisition that the Wall Street Journal said valued Kustomer at $1 billion.  Facebook also bought Giphy, a popular website for making and sharing animated images, or GIFs, in May. That acquisition has already drawn scrutiny from the United Kingdom\u2019s competition watchdog.  Facebook shares fell as much as 3% after the news before paring losses to close down 1.9%.","811":"BRUSSELS, April 9 (Reuters) - Facebook has revised the terms related to its users\u2019 data following demands from the European Commission and consumer authorities, including taking responsibility when data has been mishandled by third parties.

A Chinese government database showed that Facebook had gained approval to open a subsidiary, but the registration has since disappeared, according to checks made by Reuters.  The move is a setback for Facebook, which has been struggling to gain a foothold in China, the most populous country in the world, where its website and messaging app Whatsapp remain blocked.  The incident also illustrates how difficult it can be for a U.S. company to navigate the government bureaucracy in a country where so many technology firms have tried and failed.  \u201cTerms like \u2018The Great Firewall\u2019\u201d often gives outsiders the impression that the Chinese government is totally united on technology policy,\u201d said Matt Sheehan, an expert on China-California relations and fellow at The Paulson Institute think tank. \u201cIn reality, within that Firewall are lots of competing fiefdoms and ongoing turf wars.\u201d  China\u2019s decision comes amid escalating tensions with the United States after the world\u2019s two largest economies imposed tariffs on each other\u2019s imports.

Its hub was a planned for the province of Zhejiang, whose capital, Hangzhou, is a tech center home to some of China\u2019s top software and internet companies, including conglomerate Alibaba Group Holding.  Facebook\u2019s plans for China were similar to businesses it set up in other countries: Station F in France, Estacao Hack in Brazil, Tech Hub launch in India and Innovation Hub in Korea.  The decision to take down the approval came after a disagreement between officials in Zhejiang and the national internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, which was angry that it had not been consulted more closely, according here to the New York Times.  \u201cThis is more about internal Chinese politics than it is about Facebook and China,\u201d said Gary Rieschel, a longtime venture investor in China and founder and managing partner of Qiming Venture Partners. \u201cThe central Cyberspace Administration of China regulators were miffed they were not consulted more thoroughly by the Zhejiang authorities prior to approval.\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t think it means anything new for U.S. tech firms trying to enter China,\u201d he said.  China\u2019s central government has made it clear that it wants the country to lead in technologies like artificial intelligence, putting pressure on provincial governments to attract more technology talent.  The Chinese internet regulator was not immediately available for comment. Other Chinese officials could not be reached outside business hours.  Shares of Facebook fell as much as 24 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the company reported slowing revenue growth amid larger expenses to address concerns over privacy and security of user data.  The decision does not necessarily spell the end of opportunities for Facebook in China, and the government\u2019s withdrawal does not mean Facebook was close to bringing its social network into the country, said investors who have worked in China.  \u201cFacebook opening a research center in Hangzhou wasn\u2019t going to fast-track the entry of its main product to Chinese markets,\u201d Sheehan said.  China strictly censors foreign news outlets, search engines and social media including content from Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google.  \u201cWhile Facebook had hoped to dip a toe in the market and work with Chinese developers, its very presence appears to have become a large, and incendiary, political question,\u201d said Daniel Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, which holds 73,386 Facebook shares.","815":"WASHINGTON, June 18 (Reuters) - A senior Republican lawmaker wants Congress to promptly examine Facebook Inc\u2019s decision to launch its own cryptocurrency.

Shares of Facebook fell 4.7 percent after Bloomberg reported the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is investigating the social network company over its use of personal data.  The stock sank almost 7 percent on Monday, sparking a market-wide sell-off, after a whistleblower said a political consultancy hired by Donald Trump improperly accessed information on 50 million Facebook users to sway public opinion.  The S&P 500 technology index, after a fleeting advance at the open, were back in the red, adding to losses on Monday as Facebook\u2019s data privacy issues hit the sector on fears of increased regulation over how companies use data.  \u201cNot all the overhang has cleared, there\u2019s still some anxiety. But as a whole, we still think the space has a lot of upside and we are still constructive on tech,\u201d said Josh Navarro, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York.  Oil prices rose more 2 percent to their highest level so far this month, lifted by tension in the Middle East and the possibility of further falls in Venezuelan output.  The gains lifted the S&P energy index by 1.25 percent, easily the biggest gain among the 11 major S&P sectors.  At 11:04 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.58 percent at 24,754.76. The S&P 500 rose 0.21 percent to 2,718.55 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.28 percent to 7,364.99.  Still, declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE for a 1.07-to-1 ratio, and for a 1.09-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.  Investors are also focused on the Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day meeting where the central bank is expected to raise interest rates by a quarter percentage point. But the bigger question is how aggressive the Fed will be with monetary policy after that.  Traders currently expect two more rate hikes later this year, although they said policymakers could set a hawkish tone by forecasting four increases in their \u201cdot plot\u201d projections.  \u201cThere has been a little bit of concern from the marketplace that the Fed has become slightly more hawkish and the markets digesting where are fund rates going,\u201d said Navarro.  The past nine years of U.S. stock market gains have come with the Fed fostering an environment of easy money for the financial system, but it has begun gradually withdrawing that accommodation as the economy appears to be on healthier footing.  Aside from the Fed, the Trump administration is creating a stir with plans for up to $60 billion in new tariffs on Chinese imports by Friday, targeting technology, telecommunications and intellectual property, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The hearing will be held July 16, the advisory said.  Apple and Google did not respond to a request for comment. Amazon spokeswoman Jodi Seth said they will testify but did not share details. Facebook had no immediate comment.  This comes as the House Judiciary Committee is probing competition in digital markets as part of an investigation announced last month, with both Republicans and Democrats expressing concern about the power exercised by several of the world\u2019s most valuable companies.  The executive branch has antitrust probes underway with the Justice Department looking at Google and Apple while the FTC probes Facebook and Amazon.  The hearing also comes at a time when both Republicans and Democrats have expressed exasperation with the big tech giants, but for different reasons.  Conservatives have complained that social media companies try to diminish their voices online while progressives like presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren have called for Amazon, Google and Facebook to sell companies that they purchased previously as a way to address competition concerns.  Furthermore, Facebook is expected to pay a $5 billion penalty for its work with a consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica, which obtained data from millions of Facebook users without their permission.

Shares of Facebook Inc climbed 5 percent in premarket trading after the social media giant eased investor concerns by forecasting that margins would stop shrinking after 2019 as costs from scandals ease up.  While Facebook reported a second-straight quarter of record-low user growth, confirming investors\u2019 fears of a slowing growth, analysts said the results were not as bad as feared.

The FANG group and Apple Inc have led the slide on Wall Street this month, which has left the S&P 500 and Dow Industrials with barely any gains for the year, fanned by concerns over trade, higher borrowing and wage costs, fears of corporate earnings peaking and a host of geopolitical worries.  The S&P has not posted gains for two sessions in a row so far in October, during which the index has tumbled nearly 8 percent, on pace for its biggest monthly drop in more than eight years.  However, the U.S. economy has been growing at a healthy clip.

The largest social network, under intense pressure to combat propaganda, said it would work abroad with the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute, created in the 1980s and funded by the U.S. government to promote democratic processes. The institutes have informal ties to their namesake U.S. parties.  The partnerships, disclosed by company executives on a call with reporters, were among a slew of announcements from Facebook on election integrity ahead of major contests in Brazil next month and the United States in November.  As the company prepares a \u201cwar room\u201d that will launch for Brazil\u2019s vote, Facebook executives said that they had been testing the social network\u2019s resilience with simulations of attempted manipulation such as election-eve efforts to suppress voting with false claims about ballot procedures.  Another training exercise looked at how the company would handle a burst of pages administered in other countries suddenly promoting material related to the U.S. election.  Even as Facebook ran exercises, an article published Wednesday by the Facebook-supported Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council found that of the four most popular articles being shared recently in Brazil about corruption, three were false.  \u201cWe know that there\u2019s a lot more to do,\u201d Facebook News Feed manager Greg Marra said when asked about the Brazil falsehoods.  Executives gave few new details about the malicious propaganda they have detected, touting previously disclosed measures including a partnership with Fatima, a fact-checking organization in Brazil, and the removal of networks of \u201cinauthentic\u201d pages backed by Russia, Iran and others.  As a sign of success, they pointed to research released on Friday that Facebook users have been interacting only half as often with 570 sites flagged as spreading misinformation since the 2016 U.S. election, while Twitter use of such sites grew.  Improvements at Facebook might have been driven by changes to formulas, including the increased emphasis on postings by family and friends and reduced spread of so called \u201cclick-bait,\u201d advertising-heavy news headlines, the researchers from Stanford University and New York University said.

Facebook in December removed much larger and better-connected networks that supported Trump, including one it said was connected to the Epoch Times here, which was founded by supporters of the Falun Gong spiritual movement and often criticizes the government of China.  Epoch Times publisher Stephen Gregory denied it was connected to the network Facebook took down in December. Reuters cannot independently verify the evidence provided by either Facebook or the Epoch Times to support their claims.  Facebook said on Thursday it had removed another network that reposted content from the Epoch Times and other Falun Gong media in a follow-up action.  While smaller than the network in the December takedown, the new one had amassed more than 2 million followers by posting on topics including the Hong Kong protests, the coronavirus, and U.S. policy toward China, as well as posting animal pictures, Facebook said.  Gregory said Epoch Times had no dealings with the network taken down this week. Reuters could not confirm this.","830":"LONDON (Reuters) - Facebook\u2019s move to block all media content in Australia is a staggeringly irresponsible attempt to bully a democracy and will stiffen the resolve of legislators across the world to get tough with the technology giants, a senior British lawmaker said.  FILE PHOTO: A 3D printed Facebook logo and keyboard buttons are placed on a computer motherboard in this illustration taken January 21, 2021. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  Julian Knight, chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee of Britain\u2019s House of Commons, spoke to Reuters.  On Facebook\u2019s move in Australia:  \u201cIt is certainly deeply disturbing that Facebook is taking this step particularly during a global pandemic when trusted news sources and reaching audiences is so important for authorities. I think its deeply irresponsible to have to taken this action at this particular time.  \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is the equivalent of taking their ball home when it comes to acting against a government\u2019s legislation in this way. It throws a whole idea of Facebook cooperating with legislators around the globe out of the window.  \u201cThey\u2019ve made a great deal since the DCMS inquiry into fake news and disinformation and Cambridge Analytica which obviously first really refocused the world\u2019s attention on Facebook in its use of data and the way in which it dominates our social media landscape along with the likes of Google and Twitter.  \u201cThey\u2019ve since then said that they would be responsible and that they would cooperate with legislators. This doesn\u2019t look like cooperation to me. This looks like they\u2019re taking their ball home with them. Frankly, I think they need to rethink it very quickly.\u201d  \u201cThe idea of Facebook effectively cutting off any news source at this particular time when people need trusted information is staggering actually in its lack of care. I have to say that I think it\u2019s clear to me that in this decision. Facebook is failing to be a good global citizen.\u201d  \u201cWe represent people and I\u2019m sorry but you can\u2019t run bulldozer over that - and if Facebook thinks it\u2019ll do that it will face the same long-term ire as the likes of big oil and tobacco because basically they are the super companies of today.\u201d  SHOULD LEGISLATORS FORCE FACEBOOK TO PAY FOR NEWS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM?  \u201cYes, I think there is a case. If you gain value from carrying trusted sources of information - in the same way as if you gain values for example from music streams - that those that carry those and then sell advertising off the back of that value, should pay for it. It seems to be pretty logical.  \u201cIf they are effectively monetizing other people, then they should pay for it, in my view.\u201d  \u201cBut to be honest with you, this action - this bully boy action - that they\u2019ve undertaken in Australia will I think ignite a desire to go further amongst legislators around the world. Because the truth is: if they\u2019re not willing to cooperate, if at the first opportunity they decide to take an action such as this, and turn off people\u2019s news streams, then what frankly is the point of cooperation if that is the case?  \u201cThey therefore should face stern legislative action and be brought to heel that way rather than through the softly-softly approach which they said they wanted.\u201d  \u201cI think they\u2019re almost using Australia as a test of strength for global democracies as to whether or not they wish to impose restrictions on the way in which they do business, or corrections to the way in which they operate within markets. So, we\u2019re all behind Australia in my view.\u201d  \u201cIf they are forced to give way to Facebook on such matters, then Facebook will just feel emboldened and that it can actively go against legislation that is introduced elsewhere. So, this is a real test case.\u201d  HAVE FACEBOOK AND THE TECH GIANTS GOT A LITTLE TOO BIG FOR THEIR BOOTS?  \u201cThat\u2019s the understatement of the century isn\u2019t it?\u201d  \u201cThe way in which you tackle the tech giants in a positive way is to look at competition and exactly how they are acting in certain markets... The competition route is often the route to ensure they operate as better citizens withing the global market.\u201d","831":"March 6 (Reuters) - Social media giant Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google on Thursday recommended their San Francisco Bay area employees to work from home to minimize the risk of spreading Covid-19.

His speech ratchets up the pressure on Facebook as the U.S. and allied governments renew their push to weaken the digital protections around the billions of messages people exchange each day.  Wray steered clear of making any specific proposal, saying that \u201ccompanies themselves are best placed\u201d to offer a way for law enforcement to get around encryption.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to lose the ability to find those kids who need to be rescued,\u201d Wray said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to lose the ability to find the bad guys.\u201d  The Justice Department's No. 2 official, who spoke after Wray, took a swipe at Apple Inc AAPL.O, which already uses end-to-end encryption on its messenger, saying the company reported only 43 tips to law enforcement last year about child exploitation.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Facebook, by contrast, reported globally 16 million child-exploitation tips, a number that he said could drop by as much as 70 percent if Facebook encrypts its messaging program the way Apple has done.  \u201cAre we to assume that Apple magically ran platforms free of child exploitation?\u201d Deputy Attorney General Jeff Rosen asked. \u201cOr is it that companies with end-to-end encryption cannot see harmful illicit activity that was occurring on these platforms and they choose to avert their eyes by deploying end-to-end encryption?\u201d  The Justice Department event is part of a renewed push by the American, Australian, and British governments to force tech companies to help them circumvent the encryption that helps keeps digital communications secure.  Debates over encryption have been rumbling for more than 25 years, but officials\u2019 anxiety has increased as major tech companies move toward automatically encrypting the messages on their platforms and the data held on phones.  In the past, officials have cited the threat of terrorism to buttress their campaigns again encryption. But as Islamic State and other extremist groups fade from the headlines, governments are trying a different tack, invoking the threat of child abuse to argue for \u201clawful access\u201d to these devices.  Facebook\u2019s privacy-focused move, announced by founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg this year, is causing particular consternation because the platform is the source of millions of tips to authorities about child abuse images every year.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Zuckerberg, speaking on the company\u2019s weekly internal Q&A livestream on Thursday, defended the decision, saying he was \u201coptimistic\u201d Facebook would be able to identify predators even in encrypted systems by using the same tools it uses to fight election interference.  Many people have applauded Facebook\u2019s push for privacy and security. Academics, experts, and privacy groups have long worried that circumventing the protections around private communications would open dangerous vulnerabilities that could make the entire internet less safe, and leave billions of users exposed to abusive surveillance.  Attorney General William Barr, who also spoke at Friday\u2019s event, said the Justice Department \u201cwould like to engage with the private sector in exploring solutions,\u201d but he warned that time is running out because the deployment of \u201cwarrant-proof encryption has accelerated.\u201d  \u201cThe status quo is exceptionally dangerous, unacceptable, and only getting worse,\u201d he said.  Daniel Castro, the vice president of the Washington-based Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said in an interview ahead of Wray\u2019s speech that government officials were framing the conversation around protecting children because it\u2019s emotionally powerful.  \u201cIn the past they\u2019ve really focused on terrorism,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve really switched angles on that.\u201d","833":"FACEBOOK SHARES PARE LOSSES AND MOVE BACK INTO POSITIVE TERRITORY, LAST UP 0.04","834":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Facebook Inc and Snapchat owner Snap Inc held talks to buy Dubsmash, the Information reported on Wednesday, putting a spotlight on pop video apps at a time when Microsoft Corp is trying to workout a deal to buy rival TikTok.

It shows Dr Sohail Bhatti, Public Health Director for the territory located on Spain\u2019s southern tip, answering questions about mask-wearing.  He says: \u201cThe first thing is what will a mask do and how long will it be effective? As a PPE instrument, it\u2019s not very effective because it stops working after 15 minutes and the latest research suggests the virus stays on your mask for nine hours, so if you don\u2019t take it off appropriately, you\u2019ll get yourself contaminated. The best protection is washing your hands frequently and often.\u201d  When asked by a journalist whether people who were concerned about asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 should wear a mask to stop the virus spreading unintentionally, Bhatti responds: \u201cI don\u2019t think that works particularly well\u2026so I don\u2019t necessarily think people working in the streets need to wear masks\u201d (1.10). At the end of the video, he concludes: \u201cThe way I see people use masks, they\u2019re actually showing a lot of their own internal anxiety and fear when they wear the mask.

It was created by GBC, Gibraltar\u2019s public-funded broadcasting corporation, on April 7, 2020 (here) when the territory did not recommend wearing masks in public (here).  This guidance was in line with World Health Organisation (WHO) advice at the time.

A 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen in front of displayed stock graph in this illustration photo March 20, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  Facebook was rocked this weekend by a whistleblower who said the data firm Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed information to build profiles of voters, with the aim of electing United States President Donald Trump in 2016.  With the data storm prompting questions from authorities worldwide and sending the U.S. company\u2019s stock plunging, experts said the fallout would make non-profits privately question the site\u2019s safety for fundraising.  Facebook provides tools that allow charities to receive online donations.  Veteran fundraiser Laurence Pagnoni said the data abuse left him torn between using the social media site\u2019s unrivaled reach - Facebook has 2 billion users - and the risk of jeopardizing his professional standards.  \u201cIn fundraising we have a code of ethics, and donor privacy is at the heart of those ethics,\u201d said Pagnoni, who is the U.S. director of International Fundraising Consultancy, a London-based firm specialized in social media campaigns.

Most are women, some accompanied by children. Cardboard signs with their names scrawled in black marker hang from strings around their necks. They walk slowly around the old concrete platform yelling out the names of people they had agreed to trade with in a forum on Facebook FB.O.  They are the face of a resurgent but little-reported phenomenon in the suburbs surrounding the Argentine capital \u2013 barter clubs.  The clubs have tens of thousands of members and are attracting hundreds more every week. They have become an unofficial economic indicator, showing the toll that soaring inflation and high unemployment are exacting on South America\u2019s second-biggest economy.  The barter clubs have surfaced before, during Argentina\u2019s 2001-2002 economic crisis and in the 2009 global financial meltdown. In between those crises they never completely went away, but today the clubs operate differently. Many members are part of Facebook groups where they arrange trades before exchanging goods in person at places like the railway station.  Membership in the clubs has been soaring in recent months as poor Argentines, many of whom have lost their jobs or work off-the-books, struggle to find the cash to make ends meet. They are one sign that progress made by President Mauricio Macri last year in reducing poverty is beginning to reverse.  The country\u2019s inflation rate is running at above 25 percent, and the currency has lost more than 30 percent of its value this year in a financial crisis that economists say will likely trigger a recession.  With unemployment running at 9.1 percent and many salaries chewed up by years of high inflation, members of the barter clubs bring second-hand goods, rice or homemade produce like desserts to trade.  A chart posted on the San Miguel group\u2019s Facebook page outlines a points system for certain goods. It\u2019s aimed at ensuring participants feel their trades are fair.  A 1 kg (2 lb) pack of flour serves as a reference, with a hypothetical value of 30 pesos, or one point. Two packs of flour are worth one bottle of sunflower oil. Four packs of flour is the suggested price for one cake, while three packs can be used to get adult jeans.  When Reuters visited the San Miguel market and one in Merlo, another Buenos Aires suburb, most people seemed to be leaving with food.  Slideshow ( 11 images )  HOW ONE FAMILY BARTERS  Cecilia G\u00f3mez, whose husband lost his job at a struggling restaurant in February, was among those trading at the market.  \u201cThis helps me bring my kids milk, sugar: the things that are most necessary,\u201d she said.  Her husband spent several months working as a cartonero, the local term for people who sift through trash bins for recyclable goods, before finding a new job at a grocery store last month. He earns just 10,000 pesos ($350) per month, far less than his previous salary.  G\u00f3mez also receives a 1,000 peso-per-month subsidy from a government welfare program for each of her two children, but after paying 3,700 pesos per month for rent and 1,200 pesos for her husband\u2019s travel to work, there is not enough cash left for basic goods.  Recently, the 30-year-old housewife saw a post on the San Miguel barter club\u2019s Facebook page offering up a pair of boots in exchange for a 0.9 liter bottle cooking oil, two packets of sugar and three packs of crackers.  G\u00f3mez desperately needed the boots and accepted the offer even though she didn\u2019t actually have any of the items the poster wanted.  So she made a post of her own asking for those items, and offering in return some used clothes and a bottle of cologne she had bought for her 9-year-old son that he had never opened. After another member accepted the offer, she made both trades in person at the market.  She also brought homemade cakes and alfajores, a shortbread-based treat, to trade in exchange for some milk, flour, oil and sugar to bring home. That trade was also arranged on Facebook.  \u2018THE MONEY IS NOT ENOUGH\u2019  Slideshow ( 11 images )  Barter clubs are not unique to Argentina. Similar clubs have popped up during economic crises elsewhere, such as in rural Greece in 2015 after Athens defaulted on an International Monetary Fund loan and shut down banks to prevent a run on deposits.  The informal nature of bartering groups in Argentina means their growth is difficult to track. A spokesman for Argentina\u2019s Social Development Ministry declined to comment on the rise in barter clubs.  But Jesica Galera, founder of a Facebook barter group called \u2018Cambio x Mercaderia\u2019, said her group is receiving 50-60 new members per day.  \u201cThere are many new faces - women whose husbands lost their jobs, or those couples who both work and their wages are not enough,\u201d said Galera, who founded the 30,000-member group in April 2016.  The victory of Macri\u2019s \u2018Let\u2019s Change\u2019 coalition in midterm congressional elections last October was due in part to improved support among residents in the sprawling, working-class suburbs of Buenos Aires, where the barter clubs are mostly based. His performance raised the likelihood that Macri would be re-elected in next year\u2019s presidential election.  Since then, however, thousands of Argentines have taken to the streets to protest rises of up to 40 percent in utility bills, part of Macri\u2019s plan to cut the government\u2019s budget deficit by trimming subsidies for gas and electricity.  Higher interest rates of up to 40 percent which are meant to stem the fall in the value of the country\u2019s currency, the peso, have cut off access to finance for many businesses. More than 5,000 small and mid-sized businesses have closed in the past two years, according to the government.  As the peso lost value against other currencies in recent months, it became more expensive for Argentina to pay its debts, which are largely denominated in U.S. dollars or euros. So Macri turned to the IMF in May for financial help.  Many in the Buenos Aires area are feeling the pinch from the rise in inflation that has resulted from the currency depreciation.  \u201cThe money is not enough,\u201d said Silvia Aranda, the administrator of a barter club with 46,000 Facebook members in Merlo, a suburb of the river-front capital with more than 500,000 residents. \u201cBefore, we were getting 100 requests to join per day. Now, it is a lot more.\u201d  POVERTY RISING  Rising inflation this year has had the biggest impact on the roughly 20 percent of Argentine workers who work irregular, off-the-books jobs, said Agustin Salvia, a researcher at the Catholic University of Argentina.  Those workers, who do not benefit from union bargaining agreements that keep salaries above inflation and often find themselves without work during economic slowdowns, make up the bulk of barter club members, Salvia said.  Data published by Salvia\u2019s Argentine Observatory of Social Debt shows that nearly 29 percent of people were below the poverty line in 2017, down from nearly 33 percent in 2016 and nearly 30 percent in 2015, but the same as the nearly 29 percent registered in 2014. Salvia said he expects an increase of 2-3 percentage points in the poverty rate this year.  But Galera, the organizer of the San Miguel market, doesn\u2019t need to wait for the new poverty data to know that people are hurting. With more and more people attending her market, she said she plans to ask municipal authorities to grant her a permit for a larger space to trade in.  And housewife Cecilia G\u00f3mez will be returning to the market on Friday, again laden with her homemade alfajores. She\u2019s hoping to trade them for milk, detergent and \u2018yerba,\u2019 the bitter herb base for Argentina\u2019s signature \u2018mate\u2019 infusion.  \u201cThat is what I need urgently at home,\u201d she said.","841":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc on Thursday launched a television advertising campaign promoting its stance on data privacy, seeking to differentiate itself from tech industry rivals such as Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Facebook Inc that have become the target of regulatory scrutiny over the issue.

Apple\u2019s only previous privacy advertisement was a billboard at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January that said, \u201cWhat happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone.\u201d  Apple\u2019s campaign comes as large technology companies are under unprecedented scrutiny of their data privacy practices. Google and Facebook have drawn consumer lawsuits and inquiries from lawmakers.  Both companies have said they are making changes to boost user privacy. Last week, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said the company plans to encrypt more of the conversations happening on its messaging services, which could limit Facebook\u2019s visibility into those conversations.  Apple\u2019s primary rival is Google, which makes the Android operating system that powers most of the world\u2019s mobile phones. Google this week said it is working on privacy enhancements for Android, such as locking down access to a phone\u2019s camera and microphone.  For its part, Apple is trying to persuade consumers that it can provide competitive features, such as customized news reading lists, without Apple viewing their data.  Apple\u2019s phones do collect data on consumers, but the company has said that it cannot view that data because it remains encrypted with a personal postcode on the user\u2019s device or has identifying information stripped away before being sent to Apple.","842":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dropped on Monday, with the S&P and Nasdaq suffering their worst day in just over five weeks, as concerns over increased regulation for large tech companies was spearheaded by a plunge in Facebook shares.  Facebook shares tumbled 6.8 percent as Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg faced calls from both U.S. and European lawmakers to explain how a consultancy that worked on President Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign gained access to data on 50 million Facebook users.  The stock had its worst day since March 2014 and was down 10.8 percent from its closing record hit on Feb. 1, to put the stock squarely in correction territory, a drop of 10 percent from its high.  Facebook\u2019s plunge weighed heavily on the S&P technology sector, down 2.11 percent, as well as the Nasdaq, off more than 2 percent. Both indexes had their worst daily performance since Feb. 8.  Other major companies with large tech businesses also dropped as recent concerns over regulation in the arena increased. Apple lost 1.53 percent while Alphabet fell 3 percent and Microsoft declined 1.8 percent.  \u201cWhat\u2019s chilling to an investor is whether Facebook will be able to get advertisers to pay for the rich data they pay for today,\u201d said Kim Forrest, Senior Portfolio manager, Fort Pitt Capital, Pittsburgh.  \u201cInvestors are not only concerned about losing advertising dollars. They\u2019re also concerned these companies might come under relatively heavy regulation.\u201d  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 335.6 points, or 1.35 percent, to close at 24,610.91, the S&P 500 lost 39.09 points, or 1.42 percent, to 2,712.92 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 137.74 points, or 1.84 percent, to 7,344.24.  The S&P once again fell below its 50-day moving average, seen as a technical support level, for the first time since early March. The Nasdaq came about 2 points from its 50-day before paring losses.  Investors were also cautious ahead of a two-day monetary policy meeting at the U.S. Federal Reserve starting on Tuesday.  The market believes the Fed is set to raise interest rates on Wednesday as Thomson Reuters data shows traders expect a quarter-percentage-point hike to be a certainty. Investors are now grappling with the question of whether an improving economy could lead to more hikes than anticipated.  \u201cSome of the more salient questions investors have is, has the tone of the Fed, which this time last year was certainly more skewed towards being dovish, has it now extended to becoming more hawkish?\u201d said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.  Industrials fell 0.82 percent against the backdrop of worries about a global trade war, which are set to dominate a two-day G20 meeting in Argentina.

FILE PHOTO: Producer John de Mol of NBC's reality series \"The Voice\" poses backstage with his award for Outstanding Reality Program at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles September 22, 2013. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  Lawyers for De Mol, the businessman who created the \u201cBig Brother\u201d reality television program, told an Amsterdam District Court judge that the company had failed to prevent the ads and had not responded in a timely fashion to complaints.  The ads, which have now been removed, enticed people to send money to purchase Bitcoin or participate in fake cryptocurrency-related businesses with claims of De Mol\u2019s involvement, endorsement or backing.  De Mol\u2019s lawyers want the court to order Facebook to fix its procedures to automatically block ads featuring De Mol and cryptocurrency which they say have caused him reputational damage.  Facebook lawyer Jens van den Brink said the company could not be forced to monitor all ads on its platforms at all times, and the company had removed the ads in question quickly after being made aware of complaints.  Van den Brink also said Facebook had met with the Dutch financial markets regulator AFM earlier this week to discuss ways to combat scammers.  Lawyers for De Mol said that consumers had been swindled out of 1.7 million euros ($1.9 million) by De Mol-linked ads, and that he was only one of several Dutch celebrities targeted.  Facebook should take pre-emptive action to block such ads, and its current vetting system, which relies in part on users self-reporting problems, was not enough, Schaap said.  \u201cI don\u2019t know what reality Facebook lives in, but that doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Lawyer Jacqueline Schaap said.  De Mol also sought guarantees Facebook would hand over information about the people who create such advertisements so it could be given to the police.  Judge Remmine Dudok van Heel, who noted that she did not use Facebook herself, questioned Van den Brink closely on whether Facebook\u2019s vetting includes checking the content of webpages that advertisements link to.  Van den Brink said yes, but the company\u2019s software can be tricked by advertisers who change links in their ads or disguise the content of those pages, a problem Facebook is trying to fight, he said.  Before the hearing, Rob Leathern, a manager at California-based Facebook, told reporters the company was trying its best to prevent fraudulent ads.  \u201cThe people who push these kinds of ads are persistent, they are well-funded and they are constantly evolving their deceptive tactics to get around our systems,\u201d Leathern said.  Judge Dudok de Heel did not set a date to rule on the case. She remarked near the end of Wednesday\u2019s hearing that it seemed possible the two sides might be able to reach some agreement.","844":"NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Friday ordered two state agencies to investigate a report that Facebook Inc may be accessing far more personal information from smartphone users, including health and other sensitive data, than had previously been known.

The junta on Wednesday banned Facebook Inc until at least Sunday after the regime\u2019s opponents began using it to organize. A new civil disobedience page had gained nearly 200,000 followers and the support of Burmese celebrities in the days after the coup, while a related hashtag was used millions of times.  \u201cThe Tatmadaw sees Facebook as their internet nemesis because it\u2019s the dominant communication channel in the country, and has been hostile to the military,\u201d Human Rights Watch Asia Deputy Director Phil Robertson told Reuters, referring to the country\u2019s army.  \u201cSince the Burmese people are rapidly moving online to organize a massive civil disobedience campaign, shuttering access becomes a top priority.\u201d  A company spokeswoman on Thursday urged Myanmar authorities to restore access to Facebook and WhatsApp to the country\u2019s 54 million residents.  Facebook will have to decide how to play the delicate balance of protecting the democratic politicians and activists versus cooperating with the new regime to get services restored--an especially acute example of the political dilemmas the company faces worldwide.  In nearby Vietnam, for example, Facebook recently acquiesced to government demands that it censor more political criticism to avoid a blockade.  The service has mostly avoided shutdowns outside of countries such as China, where it has long been blocked, but currently faces pressure in India, Turkey and elsewhere.  In Myanmar, where the company has a small team, Facebook in recent years has engaged with civil rights activists and democratic political parties and pushed back against the military after coming under heavy international criticism for failing to contain online hate campaigns.  In 2018, it banned army chief Min Aung Hlaing - now Myanmar\u2019s military ruler - and 19 other senior officers and organizations, and took down hundreds of pages and accounts run by military members for coordinated inauthentic behavior.  Ahead of the Myanmar\u2019s November election, Facebook announced it had taken down a network of 70 fake accounts and pages operated by members of the military that had posted either positive content about the army or criticism of Suu Kyi and her party.  A Reuters review early this week found dozens of pages and accounts alleging election fraud - the reason given by the army for seizing power. The posts started in October and continued after the election; in the 48 hours before the coup, many of the pages called for military intervention.  After the coup, those pages turned to posts accusing the ousted government of fraud and justifying the takeover, the review showed. Some of the pages published coordinated posts criticizing or threatening politicians like Suu Kyi as well as journalists and activists.  Facebook took down dozens of the accounts on Wednesday, shortly before being shut down. Reuters could not determine their provenance.  And just two days before the coup, the new military-installed information minister, Chit Hlaing, shared a story purporting to be from Radio Free Myanmar, which Facebook banned after it was used in anti-Rohingya disinformation campaigns. The minister was not immediately reachable for comment.  By Wednesday, both his account and the post were taken down.  A spokesman for the military did not respond to multiple calls for comment.  LIKE A \u2018BAN ON THE INTERNET\u2019  Facebook plays an outsized role in Myanmar, where for many residents it is synonymous with the internet. United Nations investigators say that Facebook allowed the platform to be used by radical Buddhist nationalists and members of the military to fan a campaign of violence towards the Muslim Rohingya minority, 700,000 of whom fled an army crackdown in 2017. I In response, Facebook tried to tamp down hate speech and misinformation and ramped up partnerships with civilians, sometimes in conflict with the military. The company maintained its central role in the life for the country, and Suu Kyi\u2019s government regularly announced major initiatives on its Facebook pages. \u201cA ban on Facebook is effectively a ban on the internet,\u201d ethnic Kachin human rights advocate Zaw Htun Lat wrote on Twitter on Thursday. A Facebook spokeswoman referred Reuters to an earlier statement by Southeast Asia policy director Rafael Frankel, which states Facebook is \u201cremoving misinformation that delegitimizes the outcome of November\u2019s election\u201d.  She added that the company is treating Myanmar as an emergency and is using artificial intelligence to restrict content likely to break its rules on hate speech and incitement of violence.  At the same time, the military has used Facebook since the start of the coup. Its \u201cTrue News\u201d information unit had provided daily updates prior to Thursday\u2019s shutdown.  A page for the country\u2019s new military president was created within hours on Monday. Since then, a handful of other official government pages have been taken over by the regime and are publishing official announcements from the ministry of information warning against social media \u201crumors\u201d that could incite riots and instability.  Facebook declined to comment on how it decides who is permitted to control official government pages.","852":"June 23 (Reuters) -  * BRAZIL ANTITRUST WATCHDOG CADE SUSPENDS AGREEMENT BETWEEN FACEBOOK AND CIELO FOR WHATSAPP DIGITAL PAYMENTS- STATEMENT Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: [ ] (Reporting by Gabriel Ponte in Brasilia)","853":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc on Wednesday banned praise, support and representation of white nationalism and white separatism, a move that drew qualified approval from New Zealand where a massacre of 50 people in mosques was live streamed earlier this month.  Civil rights groups have said social media giants have failed to confront extremism and that was under the spotlight this month after a suspected white supremacist broadcast live footage of his attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand.  Facebook, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s YouTube have been under pressure to remove white supremacist and neo-Nazi content from their platforms, along with fake news and other types of abusive posts.

Life After Hate did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Representative Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security, welcomed the new approach but lamented that Facebook had not made the change sooner.  \u201cThis should have happened long ago,\u201d Thompson said in a statement. \u201cFor too long, Facebook has allowed hate speech \u2013 and the violence that it can inspire \u2013 to propagate on its platform.

There had been expectations a deal was imminent after Facebook set aside $3 billion to pay what it said it expected to be a $3 billion to $5 billion penalty. But two sources said on Monday that no deal was expected this week.  One of the sources said that announcement of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission could be a month away.  Several U.S. lawmakers have criticized aspects of a potential agreement between the FTC and Facebook that would elevate oversight of privacy policies and practices to Facebook\u2019s board of directors and require the social media company to be more aggressive in policing third-party app developers.  In a letter to the FTC, Senators Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, and Josh Hawley, a Republican, told the agency that even a $5 billion civil penalty was too little and that top officials, potentially including founder Mark Zuckerberg, should be held personally responsible.  Facebook\u2019s 2011 settlement with the FTC also required it report to the government agency about its privacy practices for 20 years.  The FTC has been investigating allegations that Facebook inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The probe has focused on whether the sharing of data and other disputes violated the 2011 consent agreement.  The lapse, as well as anger over hate speech and misinformation on its platform, has prompted calls from people ranging from progressive presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren to a Facebook co-founder, Chris Hughes, for the government to force the social media giant to sell Instagram, which it bought in 2012, and WhatsApp, purchased in 2014.

The accounts tied to Russia were largely removed for spam with a small portion of those engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior, according to the statement.  Facebook also said the pages and accounts were removed for their behavior and not content.

Slideshow ( 4 images )  Facebook had no immediate comment on the criticism on Monday, although in the past the company has said that it was working to remove hate speech in Myanmar and kick off people who shared such content consistently.  More than 650,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine state into Bangladesh since insurgent attacks sparked a security crackdown last August. Many have provided harrowing testimonies of executions and rapes by Myanmar security forces.  The U.N. human rights chief said last week he strongly suspected acts of genocide had taken place. Myanmar\u2019s national security adviser demanded \u201cclear evidence\u201d.  Marzuki Darusman, chairman of the U.N. Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, told reporters that social media had played a \u201cdetermining role\u201d in Myanmar.  \u201cIt has ... substantively contributed to the level of acrimony and dissension and conflict, if you will, within the public. Hate speech is certainly of course a part of that. As far as the Myanmar situation is concerned, social media is Facebook, and Facebook is social media,\u201d he said.  U.N. Myanmar investigator Yanghee Lee said Facebook was a huge part of public, civil and private life, and the government used it to disseminate information to the public.  \u201cEverything is done through Facebook in Myanmar,\u201d she told reporters, adding that Facebook had helped the impoverished country but had also been used to spread hate speech.  \u201cIt was used to convey public messages but we know that the ultra-nationalist Buddhists have their own Facebooks and are really inciting a lot of violence and a lot of hatred against the Rohingya or other ethnic minorities,\u201d she said.  \u201cI\u2019m afraid that Facebook has now turned into a beast, and not what it originally intended.\u201d  The most prominent of Myanmar\u2019s hard-line nationalist monks, Wirathu, emerged from a one-year preaching ban on Saturday and said his anti-Muslim rhetoric had nothing to do with violence in Rakhine state.  Facebook suspends and sometimes removes anyone that \u201cconsistently shares content promoting hate\u201d, the company said last month in response to a question about Wirathu\u2019s account.  \u201cIf a person consistently shares content promoting hate, we may take a range of actions such as temporarily suspending their ability to post and ultimately, removal of their account.\u201d","857":"Stickers bearing the Facebook logo are pictured at Facebook Inc's F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S., April 30, 2019.

FILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is displayed on a smartphone in this illustration taken January 6, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The trial, which Facebook expects will take three to four weeks, could see top executives including hardware chief Andrew Bosworth and Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer called to testify, according to a document the company filed in January.  The witness list also includes Naomi Gleit and Javier Olivan, veterans of Facebook\u2019s aggressive growth team, and Chief Revenue Officer David Fischer.  The IRS argues that Facebook understated the value of the intellectual property it sold to an Irish subsidiary in 2010 while building out global operations, a move common among U.S. multinationals. Ireland has lower corporate tax rates than the United States, so the move reduced the company\u2019s tax bill.  Under the arrangement, Facebook\u2019s subsidiaries pay royalties to the U.S.-based parent for access to its trademark, users and platform technologies. From 2010 to 2016, Facebook Ireland paid Facebook U.S. more than $14 billion in royalties and cost-sharing payments, according to the court filing.  The company said the low valuation reflected the risks associated with Facebook\u2019s international expansion, which took place in 2010 before its IPO and the development of its most lucrative digital advertising products.  \u201cFacebook Ireland and Facebook\u2019s other foreign affiliates - not Facebook US - led the high-risk, and ultimately successful, international effort to sell Facebook ads,\u201d the company said in a pre-trial memorandum.  Facebook is the world\u2019s second-biggest seller of online ads after Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google. Monthly users of its core social network climbed 8% to 2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, while 2.9 billion people used one of its apps - Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram or Messenger - each month.  Bertie Thomson, a Facebook spokeswoman, said the company stood by the decisions in 2010 when it \u201chad no mobile advertising revenue, its international business was nascent and its digital advertising products were unproven.\u201d  If the IRS prevails, Facebook would face an additional federal tax liability of up to $9 billion, plus interest and any penalties, the company estimated in a recent securities filing.","859":"FILE PHOTO: Attendees walk past a Facebook logo during Facebook Inc's F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S., April 30, 2019.

REUTERS\/Charles Platiau  NEW YORK\/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters Breakingviews) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission may want to play its biggest, yet riskiest, hand. The U.S. regulator is working with Facebook on a pricey settlement after the social network failed to protect consumer data. But a lawsuit against Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s firm might produce more significant sanctions.  Facebook estimated last month that financial penalties would be in the range of $3 billion to $5 billion and signaled an agreement was fast in the making. That was probably hasty. Agency Chair Joseph Simons wants the backing of at least one of two Democrats, who are not yet on board, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.  At the high end, $5 billion would represent about a quarter of Facebook\u2019s estimated profit this year, according to data from Refinitiv. It would also be by far the largest fine the FTC has imposed on a tech company. In 2017, a judge approved an $11 billion FTC settlement with automaker Volkswagen for its misleading emissions claims on diesel vehicles.  Yet when Facebook disclosed its legal estimates, shares shot up around 6%. Investors may see the potential fine as a simple cost of doing business. Or it could be a sign the markets were encouraged the company was not heading for a protracted lawsuit.  That path would be a huge gamble for the FTC. A settlement guarantees an outcome, which could include some accountability measures for Zuckerberg. By contrast, a judge could hand Facebook a total victory if the agency sues. It doesn\u2019t have a great legal track record. Last year the commission dropped a $4 billion false advertising lawsuit against DirecTV after a judge found that the FTC had weak evidence.  But a lawsuit against Facebook could produce evidence that shows how it really operates when it comes to user data. If the FTC wins, like it did last week when a judge ruled against Qualcomm, it could have bigger consequences for Facebook than just a fine. Zuckerberg could be named as a defendant, the FTC could take the unprecedented step of pushing for him to be stripped of his chairman title, and it might impose stricter privacy rules. Such a move could disrupt Facebook \u2013 and change its behavior - more than a settlement.","863":"(Reuters) - Snap Inc SNAP.N missed Wall Street estimates for fourth quarter revenue on Tuesday as it faced tough competition from digital advertising giants Google and Facebook, sending its shares down 10%.

REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  Snap, which owns the popular photo messaging app Snapchat, had earlier warned its peak advertising demand period between Black Friday and the December holidays had one fewer week this year.  Revenue, which the company generates from selling advertising on Snapchat, rose 44% to $560.88 million but missed the average analyst estimate of $563.03 million.  While Snap has invested in a self-serve platform to make it easier for advertisers to buy ad space, it is still a long way from stealing ad dollars from Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google and Facebook FB.O, which command a huge portion of the digital advertising market.  Snapchat has only 0.5% of worldwide digital ad revenue, while Facebook accounts for 21.1%, according to a report by market researcher eMarketer.  Snap said daily active users (DAU) on Snapchat rose 4% to 218 million in the three months ended Dec. 31 from the prior quarter.  The user metric stood at 186 million a year earlier.  Snapchat rose to fame with its photo lens filters that can overlay things like dog ears on a user\u2019s face and has added mobile games and original shows to keep its audience on the app.  Snapchat\u2019s DAU, a widely watched metric by investors and advertisers, was above analysts\u2019 average estimate of 215.04 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Average revenue per user jumped 23% to $2.58 during the quarter from a year earlier.  Snap is focusing on growing the total number of advertisers on Snapchat as well as diversifying the types of advertisers it works with, said Jeremi Gorman, Snap\u2019s chief business officer, on an earnings call with analysts.  Snap\u2019s net loss widened to $240.7 million, or 17 cents per share, from $191.67 million, or 14 cents per share, a year earlier.  The company expects first-quarter revenue in the range of $450 million to $470 million. Analysts on average were expecting $461.6 million.  \u201cGiven the substantial long-term opportunities ahead, we are working hard to scale our revenue so that we are able to self-fund our investments in the future,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Evan Spiegel said during the call.

Justice Alexandre de Moraes had ruled a day earlier that Facebook and Twitter failed to comply with orders to block the accounts because they were only blocked within Brazil, but remained accessible with foreign IP addresses.  On Friday, he ruled that Facebook must pay the fine for not complying and face further daily fines of 100,000 reais per day if it does not block the accounts in question globally.  Before the fine was announced, Facebook said on Friday that it would appeal the decision. The world\u2019s largest social network said it respects the laws of countries where it operates, but that \u201cBrazilian law recognizes the limits of its jurisdiction.\u201d  The company did not immediately comment after the fine was announced.  The judge\u2019s fine only addressed Facebook\u2019s non-compliance. It was not clear whether Twitter would face a similar fine.  Twitter said it would also appeal the decision to block the accounts.  The judge originally decided in May to block 16 Twitter accounts and 12 Facebook accounts of Bolsonaro supporters who have been linked to a probe into the spreading of fake news during Brazil\u2019s 2018 election.  The accounts were blocked due to allegations that they violated laws on hate speech.  Last week, Bolsonaro said his government would also launch a legal challenge against blocking the accounts.

U.S. Navy\/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Sean Lynch\/Handout via REUTERS  Trump last week repeatedly vowed to veto the annual National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, if it does not repeal a law that protects companies like Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc from liability for what appears on their platforms.  His threats angered lawmakers, including some of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, who said the tech measure has nothing to do with defense and that Trump\u2019s concerns - voiced only after his defeat in the Nov. 3 election - should not block major annual legislation that Congress has passed for 59 consecutive years.  \u201cHe did not raise the issue until the end of November, when we were literally almost a year into the (NDAA) process,\u201d Representative Adam Smith, Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, said on a conference call with reporters.  \u201cThere really are no other possibilities. If the president vetoes it, we will come back and vote to override,\u201d Smith said. He said he believed the legislation would receive the two-thirds majorities needed in the House and Senate to overcome a Trump veto.  Trump has issued eight vetoes during his four years as president. All of them were sustained.  Representative Mac Thornberry, the House panel\u2019s top Republican, said failure to pass the NDAA would threaten policy provisions in the bill intended to combat threats from China and Russia, and harm troops more directly by cutting their pay and delaying construction of new housing.  \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that a strong vote can persuade the White House that there\u2019s a better approach to that issue so you\u2019re not punishing the troops for something that is totally unrelated,\u201d Thornberry told reporters on a separate conference call.  The Democratic-led House is due to vote on the NDAA on Tuesday. If it passes, as expected, it would go to the Republican-majority Senate, where it is also expected to pass, sending it to the White House for Trump to sign or veto.  The NDAA includes a provision that would strip the names of Confederate generals from military facilities. Trump has also threatened a veto over this provision, although his focus more recently has been on the tech measure.  As they seek to overturn his defeat in the Nov. 3 presidential election, Trump and some Republican allies have been insisting tech companies are biased against conservatives and should be punished.  Tech firms deny having any such slant.  Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, who rarely break from him on policy matters, have come out against the veto threat, saying the tech issue may need to be addressed but it has nothing to do with the military.  Because the NDAA is one of the few major bills to pass every year, lawmakers often use it as a vehicle for policy measures that extend beyond the Pentagon.  However, this year\u2019s NDAA has been in the works for months and is at a point where it cannot be amended.","868":"April 30 (Reuters) -  * WHATSAPP FOUNDER PLANS TO LEAVE AFTER BROAD CLASHES WITH PARENT FACEBOOK - WASHINGTON POST  * CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF WHATSAPP, JAN KOUM, ALSO PLANS TO STEP DOWN FROM FACEBOOK\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS - WASHINGTON POST Source text - wapo.st\/2HFQEIw Further company coverage:","869":"FILE PHOTO: The Twitter logo is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., September 28, 2016.

FILE PHOTO: Facebook logo is reflected in glasses in this picture illustration taken April 1, 2019. REUTERS\/Akhtar Soomro\/Illustration\/File Photo  The workers categorize items according to five \u201cdimensions,\u201d as Facebook calls them.  These include the subject of the post - is it food, for example, or a selfie or an animal? What is the occasion - an everyday activity or major life event? And what is the author\u2019s intention - to plan an event, to inspire, to make a joke?  The work is aimed at understanding how the types of things users post on its services are changing, Facebook said. That can help the company develop new features, potentially increasing usage and ad revenue.  Details of the effort were provided by multiple employees at outsourcing firm Wipro Ltd over several months. The workers spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation by the Indian firm. Facebook later confirmed many details of the project. Wipro declined to comment and referred all questions to Facebook.  The Wipro work is among about 200 content labeling projects that Facebook has at any time, employing thousands of people globally, company officials told Reuters. Many projects are aimed at \u201ctraining\u201d the software that determines what appears in users\u2019 news feeds and powers the artificial intelligence underlying many other features.  The labeling efforts have not previously been reported.  \u201cIt\u2019s a core part of what you need,\u201d said Nipun Mathur, the director of product management for AI at Facebook. \u201cI don\u2019t see the need going away.\u201d  The content labeling program could raise new privacy issues for Facebook, according to legal experts consulted by Reuters. The company is facing regulatory investigations worldwide over an unrelated set of alleged privacy abuses involving the sharing of user data with business partners.  The Wipro workers said they gain a window into lives as they view a vacation photo or a post memorializing a deceased family member. Facebook acknowledged that some posts, including screenshots and those with comments, may include user names.  The company said its legal and privacy teams must sign off on all labeling efforts, adding that it recently introduced an auditing system \u201cto ensure that privacy expectations are being followed and parameters in place are working as expected.\u201d  But one former Facebook privacy manager, speaking on condition of anonymity, expressed unease about users\u2019 posts being scrutinized without their explicit permission. The European Union\u2019s year-old General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has strict rules about how companies gather and use personal data and in many cases requires specific consent.  \u201cOne of the key pieces of GDPR is purpose limitation,\u201d said John Kennedy, a partner at law firm Wiggin and Dana who has worked on outsourcing, privacy and AI.  If the purpose is looking at posts to improve the precision of services, that should be stated explicitly, Kennedy said. Using an outside vendor for the work could also require consent, he said.  It remains unclear exactly how GDPR will be interpreted and whether regulators and consumers would see Facebook\u2019s internal labeling practices as problematic. Europe\u2019s top data privacy official declined to comment on possible concerns.  A Facebook spokeswoman said: \u201cWe make it clear in our data policy that we use the information people provide to Facebook to improve their experience and that we might work with service providers to help in this process.\u201d  U.S. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat and leading critic of social media, told Reuters in a statement that large platforms increasingly are \u201ctaking more and more data from users, for wider and more far-reaching uses, without any corresponding compensation to the user.\u201d  Warner said he is drafting legislation that would require Facebook to \u201cdisclose the value of users\u2019 data, and tell users exactly how their data is being monetized.\u201d  THE PROJECT  Human-powered content labeling, also referred to as \u201cdata annotation,\u201d is a growth industry as companies seek to harness data for AI training and other purposes.  Self-driving car companies such as Alphabet Inc\u2019s Waymo have labelers identify traffic lights and pedestrians in videos to fortify their AI. Voice assistant developers including Amazon.com Inc have people annotate customer audio to improve AI\u2019s ability to decipher speech.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Facebook launched the Wipro project in April last year. The Indian firm received a $4 million contract and formed a team of about 260 labelers, according to the workers. Last year, the work consisted of analyzing posts from the prior five years.  After completing that, the team in December was cut to about 30 and shifted to labeling each month posts from the prior month. Work is expected to last through at least the end of 2019, they said.  Facebook confirmed the staffing changes but declined to comment on financial details.  The company said its analysis is ongoing so it could not provide any findings from the labeling or resulting product decisions. It has not told labelers the purpose or results of the project, and the workers said all they have inferred from their limited view is that selfies are increasingly popular.  The Wipro labelers and Facebook said the posts are a random sampling of text-based status updates, shared links, event posts, Stories feature uploads, videos and photos, including user-posted screenshots of chats on Facebook\u2019s various messaging apps. The posts come from Facebook and Instagram users globally, in languages including English, Hindi and Arabic.  Each item goes to two labelers to check accuracy, and a third if they disagree, Facebook said. Workers said they see on average 700 items per day. Facebook said the target average is lower.  Facebook confirmed labelers in Timisoara, Romania and Manila, the Philippines are involved in the same project.  Among Facebook\u2019s other labeling projects, one worker in Hyderabad for outsourcing vendor Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp said he and at least 500 colleagues look for sensitive topics or profane language in Facebook videos.  The aim is to train an automated Facebook tool that enables advertisers to avoid sponsoring videos that are, for example, adult or political, Facebook said. Cognizant did not respond to a request for comment.  Another application of labeling involved the social network\u2019s Marketplace shopping feature, where it automated category recommendations for new listings by first having labelers and product experts categorize some existing listings, Facebook\u2019s Mathur said.  PRIVATE POSTS  Facebook users are not offered the chance to opt out of their data being labeled.

Facebook fell 2.5 percent and was the biggest drag on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, after co-founders of its photo-sharing app, Instagram, resigned with scant explanation for the move.  The energy sector jumped 0.72 percent as Brent oil prices shot to a four-year high, boosted by imminent U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude exports and the reluctance of OPEC and Russia to raise output.  Financials overall rose 0.25 percent, with banks up 0.4 percent, in anticipation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at the end of its two-day meeting later on Wednesday.  Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup were all higher, also as yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. government bond held at the key 3 percent level.

REUTERS\/Toby Melville\/File Photo GLOBAL BUSINESS WEEK AHEAD  The oversight board also made non-binding recommendations, calling for the company to make its content moderation policies clearer and more precise.  DECISIONS OVERTURNED:  * A post from a user in Myanmar with photos of a deceased child that included commentary on China\u2019s treatment of Uighur Muslims. Facebook removed the post under its hate speech rules, but the board ruled the terms used were not derogatory or violent.  * An alleged quote from Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels that Facebook removed for violating its policy on \u201cdangerous individuals and organizations.\u201d The user said they intended to draw a comparison with the presidency of former U.S. President Donald Trump.

This case was submitted by Facebook.  The board said Facebook\u2019s rule against misinformation that contributes to the risk of imminent physical harm was too vague. It also recommended Facebook create a new \u2018Community Standard\u2019 on health misinformation and that it should be \u201cless intrusive\u201d in enforcing policies where content does not risk imminent physical harm.  * Instagram photos showing female nipples that the user in Brazil said aimed to raise awareness of breast cancer symptoms.

While censorship controls have hardened under Xi Jinping, who was formally appointed president in 2013, U.S. tech firms with blocked content are increasingly looking for new ways to enter the market without drawing the ire of regulators.  Google has several hundred staff in China and recently launched its own artificial intelligence (AI) lab.

During nearly five hours of questioning by 44 U.S. senators, Zuckerberg repeated apologies he previously made for a range of problems that have beset Facebook, from a lack of data protection to Russian agents using Facebook to influence U.S. elections.  But the 33-year-old internet mogul managed to deflect any specific promises to support any congressional regulation of the world\u2019s largest social media network and other U.S. internet companies.  \u201cI\u2019ll have my team follow up with you so that way we can have this discussion across the different categories where I think this discussion needs to happen,\u201d Zuckerberg told a joint hearing by the U.S. Senate\u2019s Commerce and Judiciary committees, when asked what regulations he thought were necessary.  Investors were impressed with his performance. Shares in Facebook posted their biggest daily gain in nearly two years, closing up 4.5 percent.  (GRAPHIC: Facebook shares fly as Zuckerberg speaks - tmsnrt.rs\/2GN8toG)  The shares fell steeply last month after it came to light that millions of users\u2019 personal information was harvested from Facebook by Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that has counted U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign among its clients. The latest estimate of affected users is up to 87 million.  That disclosure pitched Facebook into a crisis of confidence among users, advertisers, employees and investors who were already struggling with Facebook\u2019s reaction to fake news and its role in the 2016 election.  PACKED HEARING  The crowded Senate hearing was not without theatrics, although most was from the audience, like an activist dressed in costume as a Russian internet \u201ctroll.\u201d On Twitter, observers seemed obsessed with an extra cushion on Zuckerberg\u2019s chair that was dubbed his \u201cbooster seat.\u201d A photojournalist for Associated Press took a picture of his prepared talking points and the photo was posted on Twitter.  The Senate hearing ended just past 7 p.m. (2300 GMT), and a second session before a House of Representatives committee is scheduled for Wednesday at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT).  Wearing a dark suit and tie instead of his typical T-shirt and jeans, Zuckerberg remained largely unruffled and serious as senators questioned him. But some senators did provoke a reaction. Zuckerberg was asked whether Facebook was a monopoly. \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t feel that way to me,\u201d he said, breaking into a smile as the audience laughed.  But the senators who asked sharp questions were often at a disadvantage because each had only five minutes to pin down the billionaire.  Slideshow ( 15 images )  Democratic Senator Kamala Harris, from Facebook\u2019s home state of California, asked a line of questions about whether Zuckerberg or his senior executives considered notifying Facebook users of the data breach. She was among the lawmakers dissatisfied.  \u201cMark Zuckerberg\u2019s failure to answer several critical questions during his appearance before the Senate today leaves me concerned about how much Facebook values trust and transparency,\u201d she wrote on Twitter.  Slideshow ( 15 images )  SEEING A CONNECTION  Facebook disclosed in September that Russians under fake names used the social network to try to influence U.S. voters in the months before and after the 2016 election, writing about inflammatory subjects, setting up events and buying ads.  \u201cWe believe it is entirely possible that there will be a connection there,\u201d Zuckerberg said when asked if there was overlap between Cambridge Analytica\u2019s harvested user data and the political propaganda pushed by the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency during the 2016 presidential election, which Facebook has said was seen by some 126 million people.  The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Facebook violated an agreement it signed with the agency in 2011 by its actions in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  In the agreement, which Facebook signed to end an investigation into privacy breaches, the company promised not to misrepresent the extent to which it maintains the privacy or security of personal information, and it said it would obtain users\u2019 affirmative consent before sharing personal information with any third party.  Zuckerberg told senators he did not see the Cambridge Analytica episode as a violation. But he acknowledged that Facebook did not notify the FTC in 2015 when it first learned of that company\u2019s data-harvesting.  On Friday, Zuckerberg threw his support behind proposed legislation, known as the Honest Ads Act, that would require social media sites to disclose the identities of buyers of online political campaign ads.  On Tuesday, however, Zuckerberg would not agree to speak out further on behalf of the Honest Ads Act.  \u201cAre you going to come back up here and be a strong advocate to see that that law\u2019s passed?\u201d asked Democratic Senator Tom Udall.  \u201cSenator, the biggest thing I think we can do is implement it,\u201d Zuckerberg responded, saying that Facebook already planned to comply voluntarily.  Udall pressed: \u201cI\u2019d like a yes or no answer.\u201d  Zuckerberg again demurred, saying: \u201cI\u2019m going to direct my team to focus on this.\u201d","880":"* Facebook set for biggest ever daily pct slump after margin warning  * Amazon drops ahead of quarterly results  * US-EU trade respite boosts industrials  * Chipmakers gain on strong earnings reports from AMD, Xilinx  * Dow up 0.5 pct; S&P down 0.3 pct; Nasdaq down 1 pct (Updates to late afternoon, changes byline, adds NEW YORK to dateline)  By April Joyner  NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - Facebook\u2019s slump set the Nasdaq on pace for its biggest drop in a month, but industrial stocks rose after the United States and the European Union said they would negotiate on trade.  Facebook Inc shares dived 19.6 percent, set for their biggest ever one-day percentage drop, after the social media giant forecast years of lower profit margins. The decline in Facebook shares weighed on the S&P 500 technology index , which dropped 1.7 percent.  Shares of Amazon.com Inc, another member of the so-called FANG group of momentum stocks, fell 2.9 percent. Amazon, which is scheduled to report quarterly results after the bell on Thursday, was the second-biggest drag on the Nasdaq and S&P after Facebook.  Shares of Twitter Inc, scheduled to report its quarterly results on Friday, slid 3.9 percent.  But while the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 slumped, the Dow rose, in part on the strength of industrial stocks. Industrials, which have been a bellwether of trade tensions, were lifted after U.S. President Donald Trump and the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker agreed to work to resolve U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum and Europe\u2019s retaliatory duties.  \u201cYesterday, there was a divergence between the Dow and the Nasdaq, and you\u2019re continuing to see that today,\u201d said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. \u201cFacebook is such a big component of the Nasdaq. A sudden reversal can have a chilling effect.\u201d  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 121.25 points, or 0.48 percent, to 25,535.35, the S&P 500 lost 8.7 points, or 0.31 percent, to 2,837.37 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 82.45 points, or 1.04 percent, to 7,849.79.  Another drag on the S&P and Nasdaq was Biogen Inc, whose shares tumbled 11.9 percent as trial data from its Alzheimer\u2019s drug failed to impress investors.  McDonald\u2019s Corp shares dipped 1.8 percent after the fast-food chain missed U.S. same-store sales estimates for the first time in at least two years.  Chipmakers, however, were a bright spot amid Thursday\u2019s declines. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index rose 1.7 percent.  Shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc jumped 13.7 percent and Xilinx Inc shares climbed 10.2 percent after both companies reported robust quarterly results.  Shares of Qualcomm Inc gained 6.7 percent after the chipmaker pulled its $44 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors NV upon failing to win Chinese regulatory approval. NXP shares dropped 5.7 percent.  Supervalu Inc shares surged 65.0 percent after United Natural Foods Inc agreed to buy the supermarket operator in a $2.9 billion deal. United Natural Foods shares sank 16.2 percent, however.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.44-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.25-to-1 ratio favored advancers.  The S&P 500 posted 52 new 52-week highs and five new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 110 new highs and 66 new lows.

Facebook and Google both confirmed they will participate but declined to comment further. Twitter did not immediately comment.  In May, Facebook said it would temporarily block users who break its rules from broadcasting live video. That followed an international outcry after a gunman killed 51 people in New Zealand and streamed the attack live on his page.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam\/File Photo  The case, which was brought by an Austrian Green party politician seeking to scrub defamatory comments from the platform, is the latest to question how far social media companies must go to police online content.  Facebook criticized the opinion given by the adviser to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) - which could have major implications for how it operates - as undermining freedom of expression across borders.  Maciej Szpunar, an advocate general of the ECJ, advised that once an EU court has ordered Facebook to remove content, an injunction may be sought demanding the U.S. company seeks out all identical posts by any user worldwide.  The online giant may also be ordered to hunt down all similar information posted by the user whose post was found to be illegal, he added.  EU law \u201cdoes not preclude a host provider from being ordered to remove such information worldwide,\u201d Szpunar wrote, according to a statement released by the ECJ.  The ECJ, which is due to rule in the coming months, is not bound by such opinions but follows its adviser\u2019s lead in most cases.  \u201cThis case raises important questions about freedom of expression online,\u201d Facebook said in an emailed statement.  \u201cWe remove content that breaks the law and our priority is always to keep people on Facebook safe.

The case then went before Austria\u2019s Supreme Court, which upheld the initial ruling, but asked the ECJ to rule on whether the injunction could be extended to apply to other postings with similar content worldwide.

The world\u2019s largest social network said it respects the laws of countries where it operates, but that \u201cBrazilian law recognizes the limits of its jurisdiction.\u201d  The judge\u2019s fine only addressed Facebook\u2019s non-compliance. It was not clear whether Twitter would face a similar fine.  The judge originally decided in May to block 16 Twitter accounts and 12 Facebook accounts of Bolsonaro supporters who have been linked to a probe into the spreading of fake news during Brazil\u2019s 2018 election.  The accounts were blocked due to allegations that they violated laws on hate speech.

FILE PHOTO: Representations of virtual currency are displayed in front of the Libra logo in this illustration picture, June 21, 2019. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo  The world\u2019s largest social media network announced plans in June to launch the new currency as it expands into e-commerce but Libra has come under fire from regulators around the world who fear it could destabilize the global financial system.  The statement by Switzerland\u2019s financial market supervisor FINMA came as the Libra Association, which is based in Geneva, said it planned to apply to become a licensed payments system in the country.  FINMA said the project would be more than just a global payments system and would therefore be subject to extra requirements, from liquidity and capital allocations for risk to the management of reserves that will back the digital tokens.  \u201cFor bank-like risks, for example, bank-like regulatory requirements would apply,\u201d FINMA said in an initial assessment of the project based on the information it has so far.  A spokesman for Libra said getting clarity on how its new digital currency would be regulated in Switzerland was key for the project\u2019s development and FINMA\u2019s guidance \u201cnow define what the Libra ecosystem is, and what it is not\u201d.  To try to avoid the volatility that plagues cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, Libra will be backed by a reserve of assets, including bank deposits and short-term government securities, which will held by a network of custodians.  FINMA said the risks and returns associated with such a reserve must be borne entirely by the Libra Association and not the digital coin holders.  Libra aims to launch in June 2020 but the project has drawn sustained criticism from politicians and lawmakers around the world concerned about its impact on the financial system, user privacy and its potential for use in money laundering.  \u201cThe highest international anti-money laundering standards would need to be ensured throughout the entire ecosystem of the project,\u201d FINMA said in a statement.  The Swiss authority said wider questions about tax, competition and data protection thrown up by Facebook\u2019s plans for Libra would fall outside its remit.  \u2018LOW FRICTION, HIGH TRUST\u2019  Even if FINMA were to eventually give the project a green light, it\u2019s not clear yet whether that would satisfy authorities in other jurisdictions.  The Group of Seven advanced economies warned in July that it would not let Libra proceed until all regulatory concerns have been addressed, saying that a prolonged discussion over the project may first be required.  When Facebook announced its plans for Libra in June, politicians and regulators in the United States and other major economies almost immediately voiced concerns over a digital coin linked to Facebook\u2019s 2.4 billion monthly users.  \u201cIncreased clarity on a regulation pathway in Switzerland is key for the association\u2019s development and will help inform our conversations with regulators in other markets,\u201d Dante Disparte, the Libra Association\u2019s head of policy and communications, said in an emailed response to Reuters questions.  \u201cThe Libra coin is simply a proxy for an instantaneous payment system that is low friction and high trust,\u201d he said.  In a sign of increased scrutiny on how Switzerland will handle the application, a senior U.S. Treasury official said on Tuesday in the Swiss capital Bern that Libra must meet the highest standards for combating money laundering and terrorism financing if it is to get off the ground.  U.S. Under Secretary of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker told reporters that any cryptocurrency project, including Libra, that operates in the United States would have to clearly satisfy U.S. regulatory standards.  \u201cWhether it\u2019s bitcoin, Ethereum, Libra, our message is the same to all of these companies: anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism has to be built into your design from the get-go,\u201d Mandelker said.  The head of the global anti-money laundering watchdog Financial Action Task Force told Reuters it was monitoring Libra developments closely while a delegation of U.S. Congress members visited Switzerland to discuss the cryptocurrency.  \u201cFINMA itself is also under pressure,\u201d said Ronald Kogens, a lawyer specializing in cryptocurrencies and blockchain at Froriep, a law firm in Zurich. \u201cEveryone outside of Switzerland wants to see that the project is well regulated in Switzerland.\u201d  Applications for payments systems licenses usually take eight to 12 months, Kogens said, and that may affect Facebook\u2019s planned launched date.  \u201cI think most likely the launch date will be postponed,\u201d he said.","886":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc is no longer allowing pre-installation of its apps on Huawei phones, the latest blow for the Chinese tech giant as it struggles to keep its business afloat in the face of a U.S. ban on its purchase of American parts and software.  Customers who already have Huawei phones will still be able to use its apps and receive updates, Facebook told Reuters. But new Huawei phones will no longer be able to have Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram apps pre-installed.  Smartphone vendors often enter business deals to pre-install popular apps such as Facebook. Apps including Twitter and Booking.com also come pre-installed on Huawei phones in many markets. Twitter Inc declined to comment and Booking Holdings did not respond to a request.  The move by Facebook dampens the sales outlook for Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, whose smartphone business became its biggest revenue generator last year, powered by strong growth in Europe and Asia.  Huawei declined to comment.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google said earlier that it would no longer provide Android software for Huawei phones after a 90-day reprieve granted by the U.S. government expires in August. But Google\u2019s Playstore and all Google apps will still be available for current models of Huawei phones including those which have not yet shipped or even been built.  The Facebook ban, by contrast, applies to any Huawei phone that has not yet left the factory, according to a person familiar with the matter. Facebook declined to comment on when the suspension took place.  In May, Washington banned U.S. companies from supplying technology to Huawei, part of a long-running campaign against the company. The United States alleges that Huawei is too close to the Chinese government and that its telecom network gear and other products could be a conduit for espionage, which Huawei denies.  Buyers of current Huawei phone models that do not have Facebook pre-installed would still be able to download it from the Google Playstore. Future versions of Huawei phones, however, will not have access to the Google Playstore and its apps unless the U.S. government changes course.  Huawei has said it was prepared for the U.S. action and vowed to work around any disruptions. But some customers at stores in Europe and Asia have told Reuters that they are reluctant to buy Huawei phones in the face of uncertainties, and analysts expect a dramatic drop in Huawei smartphone sales.","887":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  DUBLIN (Reuters) - The Irish government should consider copying Australia's plan to force Facebook Inc FB.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google to share advertising revenue with local media, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Friday.

Separately, Bloomberg reported that PayPal Holdings Inc PYPL.O and Stripe Inc are also undecided about formally signing onto Libra.  Reuters reported last week that Facebook could push back the launch of Libra to tackle regulatory concerns that have been raised around the world.  Facebook announced plans to launch the digital currency in June 2020, in partnership with other members of the Libra Association set up by the U.S. tech giant to manage the project.  However, the attempt to drag cryptocurrencies into the mainstream has since met with regulatory and political skepticism globally, with France and Germany pledging to block Libra from operating in Europe.  The companies did not immediately respond to Reuters\u2019 requests for comment.

However, some Twitter users experimenting with the tool said it had created worrying opportunities for online harassment, like allowing unwanted direct messages. It also allows fleet authors to tag people who have blocked them.  Twitter said it was listening to feedback and working on fixes for safety concerns like the blocking issue.  Fleets, which include text, photos and videos, will be available at the top of users\u2019 home timelines on Twitter and on the sender\u2019s profile.  Twitter and other major social media companies are under pressure to better police abuses and viral misinformation on their sites. Twitter spokeswoman Liz Kelley said fleets are subject to the same rules as tweets.  Kelley said warnings or labels, which Twitter has started applying to content such as manipulated media and misinformation about civic processes or COVID-19, could be applied to fleets.  Twitter also confirmed it was working on a live audio feature, dubbed \u2018Spaces,\u2019 that it aims to test later this year. The feature will allow users to talk in public, group conversations. It has similarities with Clubhouse, a social platform in which users are invited to talk in voice chat rooms.  \u201cGiven all of the potential for abuse within audio spaces, we are going to be making it available first to women and historically marginalized communities,\u201d said Kelley.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The matter is being watched closely around the world as it represents the biggest challenge so far to the way the U.S. tech giants use news on some of the world\u2019s biggest websites.  WHAT DOES THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION SAY?  * The draft law states that Australian news outlets can negotiate individually or collectively with Facebook and Google over payment for content used on the tech firms\u2019 sites. Other tech firms may be added if they are deemed big enough.  * If the parties cannot reach an agreement, an arbitrator will decide whose offer is more reasonable. If Facebook or Google break any resulting agreements, they can be fined up to A$10 million ($7.4 million) in civil penalties.  * The draft also requires tech firms give media outlets notice when they change search algorithms in a way affecting the order in which content appears. They must also share their use of consumer data extracted from news content on their sites.  * The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission began investigating \u201cbig tech\u201d in 2017 and sought feedback on the draft until Aug. 28. It now hopes to work with government and industry to redraft the law before it goes before parliament.  * While internet and media companies have battled in other jurisdictions - notably in Germany over copyright of news snippets and other items published by Google - Australia\u2019s proposal represents the most expansive reform.  WHY WAS THE LAW PROPOSED?  * In recent years, traditional media companies operating in Australia have suffered huge hits to income streams, such as subscriptions and advertising. For every A$100 spent on online advertising in Australia, excluding classifieds, nearly a third goes to Google and Facebook, the competition regulator has said.  * Last year, the regulator published a report stating news outlets lacked bargaining power when negotiating with digital firms over compensation for content posted on online platforms. It said this was a problem because those same publishers relied on Facebook and Google to reach many of their consumers.  * The government wanted the tech giants to abide by a voluntary code. Citing lack of progress in discussions, it decided earlier this year that legislation was necessary.  WHAT HAS THE RESPONSE BEEN?  * The local arm of News Corp NWSA.O is a vocal supporter of the legislation. It partly blamed the tech companies for the closure of dozens of mastheads earlier this year.  * Facebook and Google said they help connect media outlets with consumers, boosting their subscriptions and enabling them to charge advertisers more. Facebook said in the first five months of 2020 it sent 2.3 billion \u201cclicks\u201d worth about A$200 million to Australian news websites via articles appearing on Facebook users\u2019 pages. Google has said it would pay for content, though no major media organisation has agreed to its terms.  * Australia has previously engaged in lengthy battles with major corporations. In 2012, the then centre-left government became the first in the world to prohibit cigarette companies from using designs on their packaging to attract consumers. Tobacco companies mounted legal challenges but the courts ultimately upheld the law.","893":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany\u2019s Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told Reuters on Tuesday that the recent withdrawal of several important companies from Facebook\u2019s Libra project was a good sign, adding that the plan poses a threat to the stability of world finances.

While IDA CEO Martin Shanahan said he expected the strong performance to continue in the first half of 2020, the state agency said subdued global economic growth, continued trade tensions and capacity constraints in the Irish economy posed significant downside risks over the next five years.  The list of risks in the IDA\u2019s report omitted new global rules under consideration on how and where big internet companies pay tax that could test multinationals\u2019 commitment to Ireland where they pay a low 12.5% corporate tax rate.  \u201cTax is permanently with us, it is part of the puzzle but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve any reason to be fearful (from the planned global changes),\u201d Shanahan told a news conference.  \u201cIt\u2019s too early for them (companies) or us to say what exactly the impacts are likely to be and they might be very different from company to company. At the moment there is no indication that companies are thinking differently about Ireland based on anything that may be coming down the line.\u201d  Shanahan said the clearest evidence of that commitment could be seen in the 2019 jobs figures, led at the start of the year by Facebook\u2019s hiring of 1,000 more people in Dublin where its new 14 acre European headquarters is under construction.  The 1,500 jobs U.S. cloud software maker Salesforce announced it would add over the next five years was one of the largest job commitments in the IDA\u2019s 70-year history.  Half of the 250 companies that invested in Ireland last year did so for the first time, the IDA said.  However, competition for investment was strong with Shanahan identifying some countries in Eastern Europe as doing \u201cextraordinarily well\u201d in the race to attract multinational jobs.  He added that he found it difficult to see how neighbouring Britain - already a \u201cformidable competitor\u201d - could become much more competitive if its exit from the European Union reduces its access to the bloc\u2019s single market.  Uncertainties around Britain\u2019s EU departure has seen close to 90 firms making Brexit-related investments in Ireland since 2016, with over 5,500 associated jobs, the IDA said.","895":"FILE PHOTO: Austrian lawyer and privacy activist Max Schrems displays his Facebook account's updated terms page during a Reuters interview in a cafe in Vienna, Austria, May 22, 2018.

In a commentary emailed on Monday by the Boston fund firm, Danoff said Facebook, his fund\u2019s largest position, \u201cconfronted some stiff headwinds\u201d in the first six months of 2018.  Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, was hauled before U.S. Congress in April to explain how data belonging to 87 million users was improperly shared with a political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, and why it ran ads and posts placed by Russian operatives in what U.S. authorities believe was an attempt to influence the U.S. 2016 election.  \u201cFacebook management responded thoroughly to legislators\u2019 concerns and implemented a comprehensive plan to uphold the trustworthiness of its digital communities,\u201d Danoff said in a question-and-answer portion of the commentary, which was dated June 30 and included in a \u2018Fidelity Investment Insights\u2019 email on Monday.  A Fidelity spokeswoman said Danoff would not elaborate on the comments. A spokeswoman for Facebook, which has described steps it is taking to combat abuse of its service, declined to comment on Danoff\u2019s note.  Facebook\u2019s failure to protect users\u2019 data and to police some misleading content has caused some shareholders to call for change at the company.  Activists put several reforms up for votes at Facebook\u2019s annual meeting in May, including calls for a risk committee and a report on content. None gained a majority of votes, but Facebook later gave a board committee new risk oversight responsibilities.  Passing proposals opposed by Zuckerberg is nigh on impossible, given that Facebook\u2019s dual share structure means he has control of about 60 percent of the company\u2019s voting shares.  A filing last week showed Contrafund sided against most of the reforms and backed all Facebook directors in board elections. Danoff\u2019s commentary did not address the thinking behind the votes.

FILE PHOTO: Stickers bearing the Facebook logo are pictured at Facebook Inc's F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S., April 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam\/File Photo  The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said the Communications Decency Act (\u201cCDA\u201d), a 1996 law regulating internet content, shielded Facebook from civil liability.  It also declined to consider the plaintiffs\u2019 foreign law claims, noting that most plaintiffs, including relatives and estates of victims, said they were Americans living in Israel.  The plaintiffs originally sought $3 billion in damages from Facebook, for allowing Hamas to use its platform to encourage terrorist attacks in Israel, celebrate successful attacks, and generally support violence toward that country.  Their complaint described Hamas attacks against five Americans, four of whom died, in Israel from 2014 to 2016.  Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, did not immediately respond to similar requests.  Wednesday\u2019s decision is a fresh setback to efforts to hold companies such as Facebook and Twitter Inc liable for failing to better police users\u2019 online speech.  It upheld a May 2017 dismissal by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn.  In seeking to overturn that dismissal, the plaintiffs said Facebook functioned as a matchmaker between Hamas and people receptive to its messages, and should not be immune from liability as a mere \u201cpublisher\u201d of Hamas\u2019 content.  Circuit Judge Christopher Droney, however, said it would turn the CDA \u201cupside down\u201d to suggest that Facebook\u2019s having become an \u201cespecially adept\u201d publisher exposed it to liability.  He also refused to hold Facebook liable because its \u201cfriend\u201d and content-based algorithms might have helped direct people interested in Hamas.  \u201cMerely arranging and displaying others\u2019 content to users of Facebook through such algorithms - even if the content is not actively sought by those users - is not enough to hold Facebook responsible as the \u2018developer\u2019 or \u2018creator\u2019 of that content,\u201d Droney wrote.  Chief Judge Robert Katzmann, part of the three-judge appeals court panel, dissented from the algorithms discussion.  He said Congress did not consider how broadly to immunize social media companies, when it passed the CDA to regulate online pornography, and might rethink how to treat those accused of encouraging terrorism, propaganda and extremism.  \u201cOver the past two decades the Internet has outgrown its swaddling clothes,\u201d Katzmann wrote. \u201cIt is fair to ask whether the rules that governed its infancy should still oversee its adulthood.\u201d  The U.S. Department of State has designated Hamas a foreign terrorist organization since 1997.

This claim is false, as the use of black salve, which contains both a corrosive agent and a toxic plant extract, destroys both healthy and cancerous skin cells, potentially causing serious infection and permanent disfigurement.  Reuters Fact Check. REUTERS  Examples of posts making this claim can be found here , here and here .  Some of the posts in question show images of a man named Bill O\u2019Leary, whose website \u201cOne Answer to Cancer\u201d allegedly documents his use of black salve to treat a patch of basal cell carcinoma on his nose (here).  As explained here by The Conversation, black salve, which is also known as \u201cblood root\u201d, \u201cIndian paint\u201d and \u201cred root,\u201d is typically made from zinc chloride, \u201ca destructive agent, which is corrosive to metals\u201d and sanguinarine, \u201ca toxic plant extract\u201d that comes from \u201cSanguinaria canadensis, a perennial flowering plant native to northeastern America.\u201d  Historically, the substance was used by indigenous Americans as well as early European colonists who used it to treat wounds, warts and moles. In the 1930s, a U.S. physician named Fred Mohs used a substance containing a small amount of blood root to stabilize a tumor and examine it under a microscope.  \u201cThis historical use has been used to give credibility to the use of black salve to treat skin malignancies, despite the fact Mohs publicly renounced its use for this purpose,\u201d The Conversation explains (here).  According to WebMD, some believe the use of black salve can kill cancer cells (here). The corrosive substance, however, also kills healthy tissue since \u201cthe salve can\u2019t tell the difference.\u201d Its use is dangerous because it \u201cdamages the skin by killing tissue and leaves behind a dry, dark scab or completely wears it away\u201d and \u201ccan cause side effects such as pain and infection.\u201d  In addition, the salve \u201conly affects the cells it touches.\u201d Skin cancers like melanoma \u201coften go deeper than your skin\u2019s outer layer,\u201d which means the cancer \u201ccould keep growing in the deeper layers\u201d (here).  The sale of black salve as a cancer treatment is illegal in the United States (here). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an urgent warning about the dangers associated with the substance, stating that black salve \u201ccan destroy the skin and result in permanent disfigurement, tissue necrosis (death of cells in living tissue), and can result in infection (here).  As stated here by the American Academy of Dermatology, there \u201cis no proof black salve can cure cancer.\u201d In fact, their Journal has reported that a man who refused to get a skin biopsy for a growth on his nose chose to treat it himself with black salve, the side of his nose disappeared after several months of applying the substance to his growth.  \u201cIf a product or therapy seems too good to be true, that\u2019s usually a sign that it is,\u201d the academy states.  VERDICT  False. Black salve corrodes both cancerous and healthy skin tissue. Its use is not approved by the FDA to treat skin cancer or any other skin condition.

Privacy concerns have swamped Facebook since it acknowledged last month that information about millions of users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, a firm that has counted U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral campaign among its clients.  Zuckerberg said on Wednesday under questioning by U.S. Representative Ben Luj\u00e1n that, for security reasons, Facebook also collects \u201cdata of people who have not signed up for Facebook.\u201d  Lawmakers and privacy advocates immediately protested the practice, with many saying Facebook needed to develop a way for non-users to find out what the company knows about them.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got to fix that,\u201d Representative Luj\u00e1n, a Democrat, told Zuckerberg, calling for such disclosure, a move that would have unclear effects on the company\u2019s ability to target ads. Zuckerberg did not respond. On Friday Facebook said it had no plans to build such a tool.  Critics said that Zuckerberg has not said enough about the extent and use of the data. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear what Facebook is doing with that information,\u201d said Chris Calabrese, vice president for policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a Washington advocacy group.  COOKIES EVERYWHERE  Facebook gets some data on non-users from people on its network, such as when a user uploads email addresses of friends. Other information comes from \u201ccookies,\u201d small files stored via a browser and used by Facebook and others to track people on the internet, sometimes to target them with ads.  \u201cThis kind of data collection is fundamental to how the internet works,\u201d Facebook said in a statement to Reuters.

REUTERS\/Aaron P. Bernstein\/File Photo  Asked if people could opt out, Facebook added, \u201cThere are basic things you can do to limit the use of this information for advertising, like using browser or device settings to delete cookies. This would apply to other services beyond Facebook because, as mentioned, it is standard to how the internet works.\u201d  Facebook often installs cookies on non-users\u2019 browsers if they visit sites with Facebook \u201clike\u201d and \u201cshare\u201d buttons, whether or not a person pushes a button. Facebook said it uses browsing data to create analytics reports, including about traffic to a site.  The company said it does not use the data to target ads, except those inviting people to join Facebook.  TARGETING FACEBOOK  Advocates and lawmakers say they are singling out Facebook because of its size, rivaled outside China only by Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, and because they allege Zuckerberg was not forthcoming about the extent and reasons for the tracking.  \u201cHe\u2019s either deliberately misunderstanding some of the questions, or he\u2019s not clear about what\u2019s actually happening inside Facebook\u2019s operation,\u201d said Daniel Kahn Gillmor, a senior staff technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union.  Zuckerberg, for instance, said the collection was done for security purposes, without explaining further or saying whether it was also used for measurement or analytics, Gillmor said, adding that Facebook had a business incentive to use the non-user data to target ads.  Facebook declined to comment on why Zuckerberg referred to security only.  Gillmor said Facebook could build databases on non-users by combining web browsing history with uploaded contacts. Facebook said on Friday that it does not do so.  The ACLU is pushing U.S. lawmakers to enact broad privacy legislation including a requirement for consent prior to data collection.  The first regulatory challenge to Facebook\u2019s practices for non-users may come next month when a new European Union law, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), takes effect and requires notice and consent prior to data collection.  At a minimum, \u201cFacebook is going to have to think about ways to structure their technology to give that proper notice,\u201d said Woodrow Hartzog, a Northeastern University professor of law and computer science.  Facebook said in its statement on Friday, \u201cOur products and services comply with applicable law and will comply with GDPR.\u201d  The social network would be wise to recognize at least a right to know, said Michael Froomkin, a University of Miami law professor.  \u201cIf I\u2019m not a Facebook user, I ought to have a right to know what data Facebook has about me,\u201d Froomkin said.","905":"FILE PHOTO: Silhouettes of mobile users are seen next to a screen projection of Facebook logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018.

One in six of those groups was linked to Russia, according to a University of Wisconsin-Madison study here, and the identities of the rest of the 122 groups that are labeled \"suspicious\" are still unknown, an indication of the influence of \"astroturf\" or shell companies in U.S. politics.  Over a quarter of the suspicious ads mentioned Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, two of the presidential candidates in the election, and 9 percent expressly advocated for or against individual candidates.  Most other ads deliberately avoided mentioning candidate names while still getting the message out by doing things like supporting policies pushed by candidates, Young Mie Kim, the lead researcher said.  The researchers labeled suspicious ad-buyers as groups with pages that have been inactive, inaccessible, removed or banned by Facebook since the election and there was no information available publicly about them.  Project DATA, the research team, also found that voters were also disproportionately targeted in swing states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania with ads that focused on issues like guns, immigration and race relations.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  The three companies have a chance to burnish their images amid intense U.S. regulatory scrutiny by the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general and the House Judiciary Committee, who accuse the companies of engaging in anti-competitive behavior by using their clout to defend market share or expand into adjacent markets.  Washington lawmakers from both parties regularly attack the companies with a broad range of accusations, from doing too little to protect children to aiding hucksters who use the coronavirus outbreak to rip people off.  But the coronavirus pandemic has offered the companies, all of whom hold sizable cash reserves and have an outsized capacity to influence American lives, a chance to play the role of savior while casting aside the image of profiteering data usurpers.  \u201cI\u2019m glad that they\u2019re willing to help,\u201d Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican, said of Google\u2019s efforts to develop screening mechanisms for the virus. \u201cI hope that they\u2019re actually helping and not using this as an opportunity to drum up business.\u201d  Facebook Inc was the latest company to announce it wanted to help limit the economic damage from the coronavirus on Tuesday when it said it would give $100 million in cash grants and ad credits to up to 30,000 small businesses in over 30 countries.

The top Republican and Democrat on the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee said Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg should have disclosed those partnerships when he appeared before them in April.  \u201cClearly, the company\u2019s partnerships with Chinese technology companies and others should have been disclosed before Congress and the American people,\u201d the panel\u2019s Republican chairman Greg Walden and ranking Democrat Frank Pallone said in a statement.  \u201cWe strongly encourage full transparency from Facebook and the entire tech community,\u201d they wrote.  On Tuesday, Facebook said Huawei Technologies Co Ltd , computer maker Lenovo Group, and smartphone makers OPPO and TCL Corp were among about 60 companies worldwide that received access to some user data after they signed contracts to re-create Facebook-like experiences for their users.  Huawei, the world\u2019s third-largest smartphone maker, has come under scrutiny from U.S. intelligence agencies who argue that Chinese telecommunications companies provide an opportunity for foreign espionage and threaten critical U.S. infrastructure, something the Chinese have consistently denied.  Former Vermont Governor Howard Dean, a Democrat, said in a post on Twitter on Wednesday that he would close his Facebook page.  \u201cWhat Facebook did will likely result in imprisonment or other punishment of Chinese young people. Facebook is amoral. It\u2019s all about the money for them,\u201d he wrote.  Senator Ed Markey, a Democrat, said on Twitter: \u201cMark Zuckerberg needs to return to Congress and testify why @facebook shared Americans\u2019 private information with questionable Chinese companies.\u201d  He sent a letter to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday asking them to call Zuckerberg to testify.  Facebook said on Tuesday it would end the Huawei pact this week, was ending the other three Chinese partnerships, and that more than half the partnerships had already been wound down.  A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman had no comment on the companies\u2019 agreements.  Members of Congress expressed concern after The New York Times reported that the data of users\u2019 friends could have been accessed without their explicit consent. Facebook denied that and said the data access was to allow its users to access account features on mobile devices.  The Federal Trade Commission, which settled with Facebook in 2011 over its information-sharing practices, declined comment on these most recent allegations.  In a separate letter on Tuesday, the Senate Commerce Committee also pressed Facebook for more information, while the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s top Democrat urged Facebook to release further details.  Facebook said it would address the Commerce Committee\u2019s questions.  Congressional staff have said the company still has not answered hundreds of questions from lawmakers after Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony before two committees in April.  Several congressional aides said members of Congress were waiting for Facebook\u2019s answers before deciding whether to hold additional hearings.  Other companies that have used Facebook data sharing include Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, HTC Corp, Microsoft Corp and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , Facebook has said.  Several countries are scrutinizing the social network after it failed to protect the data of some 87 million users that was shared with now-defunct political data firm Cambridge Analytica. (Reporting by David Shepardson; Additional reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Bernadette Baum)","908":"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s information regulator slapped Facebook with a small but symbolic fine for breaches of data protection law after millions of users\u2019 data was improperly accessed by consultancy Cambridge Analytica.  The 500,000 pound ($663,850) fine is less than 10 minutes worth of revenue for the social media firm worth $590 billion, whose shares were unchanged, but is the maximum amount allowed and represents the first move by a regulator to punish Facebook for the Cambridge Analytica controversy.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has faced questioning by U.S. and EU lawmakers over how the political consultancy obtained the personal data of 87 million Facebook users from a researcher. The company has promised to introduce reforms to its policies before local elections in Britain next year.  Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said Facebook had broken the law by failing to safeguard people\u2019s information and had not been transparent about how data was harvested by others on its platform.  \u201cNew technologies that use data analytics to micro-target people give campaign groups the ability to connect with individual voters. But this cannot be at the expense of transparency, fairness and compliance with the law,\u201d she said in a statement.  Facebook said it was reviewing the report and would respond soon. It can respond to the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) before a final decision on a fine is made.  \u201cAs we have said before, we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and take action in 2015,\u201d Erin Egan, Facebook\u2019s Chief Privacy Officer, said in a statement, adding it was working closely with the ICO and authorities in the United States and other countries on investigations into the consultancy.  The fine is the maximum allowed under Britain\u2019s old data protection law, although that was replaced by the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May, where companies can be fined up to 4 percent of revenue for breaches.  Charity Privacy International said that regulators were getting tougher on Facebook.  FILE PHOTO: A woman looks at the Facebook logo on an iPad in this photo illustration taken June 3, 2018. REUTERS\/Regis Duvignau\/Illustration  \u201cRegulators have and are using their teeth. And as Facebook needs no reminding, under the EU\u2019s data protection law GDPR, regulators have much bigger and more significant powers, as well as the ability to issue far larger fines,\u201d said Frederike Kaltheuner, data exploitation program lead at the charity.  The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is still investigating Facebook, and is yet to penalize the company.  FAKE NEWS  British lawmakers have launched an inquiry into \u201cfake news\u201d and its effect on election campaigns, and have increasingly focused on Cambridge Analytica. The ICO said it was providing the interim report to help that inquiry.  \u201cGiven that the ICO is saying that Facebook broke the law, it is essential that we now know which other apps that ran on their platform may have scraped data in a similar way,\u201d Damian Collins, chair of the parliamentary inquiry, said.  Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by Donald Trump in 2016, has denied its work on the U.S. president\u2019s successful election campaign made use of data.  It has also said that, while it pitched for work with campaign group Leave.EU before the Brexit referendum in Britain in 2016, it did not end up doing any work on the campaign.  The ICO\u2019s report said other regulatory action would include a criminal prosecution against Cambridge Analytica\u2019s parent firm, SCL Elections, for failing to deal with the regulator\u2019s enforcement notice.  It also said it would send warning letters to 11 political parties to compel them to audit their data protection practices.  It said it was investigating both leave and remain campaigners in the referendum, and that it had issued an enforcement notice for AIQ, a data firm that worked for official Brexit campaign Vote Leave, to stop processing retained data from British citizens.  David Carroll, an academic who is attempting to recover his data from Cambridge Analytica, said the report strengthened his legal challenge.  \u201cOur day in British court may be within reach,\u201d he told Reuters in an email.  \u201cThe fines may seem like rounding errors for Facebook ...

After the video surfaced last month, it was widely shared on Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet Inc\u2019s YouTube.  YouTube took down the video, citing policy violations, but Facebook did not remove the clip, only limiting its distribution and telling users trying to share it that it might be misleading.  \u201cIt took a while for our system to flag the video and for our fact checkers to rate it as false... and during that time it got more distribution than our policies should have allowed,\u201d Zuckerberg said.  Pelosi criticized Facebook\u2019s refusal to remove the video and said the incident had convinced her the company knowingly enabled Russian election interference.  Misinformation through altered videos is a rising concern in the run-up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election, especially as artificial intelligence (AI) is now being used to produce clips that look genuine and realistically appear to show people saying words they have not spoken.

The company faces a barrage of criticism from members of both parties and the public over issues ranging from political bias to privacy lapses, election-related activity and its dominance in online advertising.  An advertising powerhouse, Facebook also faces antitrust investigations by the Federal Trade Commission and a number of state attorneys general, as well as numerous legislative proposals that seek to restrict how it operates. Facebook may also face an antitrust probe by the U.S. Justice Department.  Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat who arranged a dinner for Zuckerberg with other senators Wednesday night, told Fox Business Network, \u201cFacebook leadership realizes that failure to have federal legislation (on internet issues) is actually going to hurt them and the whole platform industry in the long run.\u201d  After the dinner, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said he had brought up Facebook\u2019s \u201crepeated failures\u201d in election security and consumer privacy. \u201cWe had (a) serious, substantive conversation even when we may have differed,\u201d he said in a statement.  Another critic was Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican who has accused Facebook of suppressing conservative speech. After meeting with the Facebook founder Thursday, Hawley said discussions had been \u201cfrank,\u201d often a euphemism for contentious.  Hawley urged Zuckerberg to sell Facebook\u2019s Instagram and WhatsApp units, which would limit how much information it could compile about an individual.  \u201cSafe to say he was not receptive to those suggestions,\u201d Hawley said dryly.  Zuckerberg was in no mood to talk to reporters between meetings, refusing over and over again to offer even the barest assessment of the discussions.  Also on Friday, Facebook said it had suspended tens of thousands of apps on the social networking platform, its first major update on an ongoing app developer audit it began in March 2018 to prevent a repeat of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  Rep. David Cicilline, chair of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust panel, said Friday that Zuckerberg pledged cooperation with the panel\u2019s probe into online markets.  The House of Representatives Judiciary Committee opened an investigation into competition in digital markets in June, one of a series of investigations facing big tech companies like Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Facebook and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google.  Last week, the panel demanded emails, detailed financial information and other company records from the four companies\u2019 top executives. They have until Oct. 14 to produce the documents.  While lawmakers like Hawley and Blumenthal seemed unsatisfied with Zuckerberg\u2019s responses, Senator Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, took a milder tack.  \u201cI encouraged him to come to the table, help us out -- and this is not an adversarial role from my perspective,\u201d Collins said, noting they did not discuss whether Facebook will comply with the document requests. \u201cI think with their involvement you are going to see a lot more participation.\u201d","913":"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Australian privacy regulator filed a lawsuit against Facebook Inc FB.O, accusing the social media giant of sharing the personal details of more than 300,000 people with political consultant Cambridge Analytica without their knowledge.

The suit sought unspecified damages, adding that each breach of privacy law could draw a maximum penalty of A$1.7 million ($1.1 million). The fine would amount to A$529 billion if the court awarded the maximum for each of the 311,127 instances.

In the months after Trump\u2019s election, Cambridge Analytica registered a business in Australia but never went to work for an Australian political party.  In the Australian lawsuit, the Information Commissioner said Facebook did not know the exact nature of the data it shared with Cambridge Analytica\u2019s \u2018This Is Your Digital Life\u2019 program, but that it failed to take reasonable steps to protect users\u2019 personal information.  \u201cAs a result, the Affected Australian Individuals\u2019 personal information was exposed to the risk of disclosure, monetisation and use for political profiling purposes,\u201d the court filing said.  \u201cThese breaches amounted to serious and\/or repeated interferences with the privacy of the Australian Affected Individuals,\u201d it added.

REUTERS\/Thomas White  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters Breakingviews) - Instagram is becoming Facebook\u2019s sugar daddy. The $521 billion social network\u2019s image-sharing unit is a big reason for the company\u2019s strong first-quarter top-line growth. There\u2019s room to wedge more revenue-earning ads into users\u2019 feeds. The risk, though, is the distractions and dodgy content that hamper the \u201cold\u201d Facebook spread to Instagram.  Facebook on Wednesday said revenue jumped 26 percent to $15.1 billion in the first quarter. Mark Zuckerberg can largely thank Instagram for that. It recently added an in-app checkout button for certain brands, with Instagram getting a cut of sales. So-called Stories, which features photos and videos that disappear after 24 hours, are also attracting advertisers. KeyBanc Capital Markets\u2019 analyst believes 50 percent of Facebook\u2019s revenue in 2019 will be driven by Instagram.  The app is also critical to bringing in the next generation of users. Snapchat, Snap\u2019s disappearing-messaging service, is the most popular social-media service, according to a recent Piper Jaffray study of 8,000 teens, but Instagram is the most used. Engagement with Facebook\u2019s original eponymous newsfeed is declining, though, and only 6 percent of the teens said it\u2019s their favorite platform.  Yet as Facebook chases Instagram revenue, it risks alienating users who partly like it because it has its own identity. Ads that intrude on the experience, and the possible proliferation of questionable content, could hurt Instagram\u2019s stand-alone brand. Facebook plans to further integrate Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram as part of a push to embrace private networks, and that could blur their differences, too.  Facebook has also lapsed on data security, including with Instagram. In March, the company said it had accidentally stored tens of thousands of passwords of Instagram users on its internal data-storage systems, accessible to employees. Last week, it updated that figure to say millions of users\u2019 logins were exposed. That\u2019s hardly appealing to users. It also can have financial costs: Facebook\u2019s first-quarter profit took a hit because of a likely fine from the Federal Trade Commission, related to data-protection violations, that the company said could range from $3 billion to $5 billion.  There have been questions about Instagram\u2019s direction since co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger left Facebook last year. As the company\u2019s overall user growth slows, Zuckerberg can\u2019t afford to let his sweetest product turn sour.","923":"LONDON (Reuters) - Facebook FB.O on Wednesday said it had suspended a network of accounts used by Russian military intelligence to seed false narratives online targeting Ukraine and other countries in Eastern Europe.  \u201cAlthough the people behind this network attempted to conceal their identities and coordination, our investigation found links to Russian military intelligence services,\u201d Facebook said in a statement.  Facebook, which has struggled to stop governments and political groups using its platform to spread false or misleading information, regularly announces it has shut down disinformation campaigns from countries including Russia.  The Russian Defense Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Moscow has previously denied Western allegations of political meddling, including findings by U.S. Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller that it used social media accounts in an attempt to sway the 2016 U.S. presidential vote.  Facebook\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, said the latest Russian operation used more than 100 accounts on Facebook and its Instagram photo-sharing platform to create fake personas, often posing as journalists in the targeted countries.  These accounts then contacted local media and politicians to plant false stories about politically divisive issues, such as corruption allegations, ethnic tensions in the Russian-annexed peninsula of Crimea and the downing of a Malaysian airliner in Ukraine in 2014.  \u201cWe\u2019ve known for a long time that these people look for authentic voices to amplify their narratives,\u201d Gleicher told Reuters. \u201cIt is more of a classic intelligence operation, trying to manipulate key individuals to achieve a high impact.\u201d  Researchers at social media analytics firm Graphika, who reviewed the accounts before they were suspended by Facebook, said most of the activity dated back to 2016 and 2017, although some accounts were active as recently as this year.  The network failed to gather more than a few thousand followers but was able to get articles published in some local media outlets, said Ben Nimmo, Graphika\u2019s head of investigations.  The fake journalist personas also conducted interviews with Kremlin critics, tricking them into making unguarded comments and then sharing the messages online, he said.  \u201cThe operation tried to poison the well of information by using false personas to plant pro-Kremlin and anti-Western narratives online and in local news outlets,\u201d said Nimmo.

One was linked to a previously-identified Iranian network that has targeted the United States and the other to a PR firm in Vietnam.","924":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc removed on Thursday a fast-growing group in which supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump posted violent rhetoric, as it and other companies tackled baseless claims and potential violence after a contentious election.

As tallies increasingly improve the odds for Trump\u2019s Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, and as U.S. broadcasters and other major media outlets brush off Trump\u2019s claims of victory, the president and his supporters have taken to social media to try to turn the narrative around, floating conspiratorial theories using the hashtag #StopTheSteal. [nL1N2HQ0XY]  But social media companies have been signaling less patience with disinformation and calls for violence. Eleven of the president\u2019s 32 tweets since Election Day on Tuesday have been placed behind a warning label saying they were disputed, prompting him to use email and other media to voice his claims, researchers said.  \u201cSocial media platforms can\u2019t allow themselves to be used to foment anti-democratic and potentially violent activity,\u201d said Paul Barrett, deputy director of New York University\u2019s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights.

Trump campaign social media manager Ryann McEnany decried Snap\u2019s action in a tweet, saying in capital letters: \u201cWhy won\u2019t they let the American people see this!?\u201d  Twitter on Thursday suspended an account used by former Trump campaign manager Steve Bannon after he recorded a video in which he called for beheading FBI Director Christopher Wray as well as government infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci for being disloyal to Trump.  A Twitter spokesman cited company policy against glorifying violence. Other services also removed the video on similar grounds.  But the takedowns and warnings are something Trump supporters appear prepared for. Before Facebook deleted \u201cStop the Steal,\u201d organizers directed members to an email sign-up page \u201cin the event that social media censors this group.\u201d  The group\u2019s membership surged because seven prominent conservatives promoted it to their hundreds of thousands of followers, according to Renee DiResta, a researcher involved in the anti-misinformation Election Integrity Partnership.  While Facebook groups typically work as forums for shared interests, they can harbor hyper-partisan misinformation.  \u201cFacebook has been enabling and amplifying the infrastructure that\u2019s now being used to attack our democratic process,\u201d said Arisha Hatch, executive director of the Color of Change political action committee, one of the country\u2019s largest online racial justice groups.  A review of a small number of comments posted to \u201cStop the Steal\u201d before its deletion found no direct calls for violence, but its organizing premise - that Republican votes are being \u201cnullified\u201d by Democrats - has no basis in fact.

Sporting a suit and tie, Zuckerberg also fended off aggressive questions on election interference, free speech, hate groups and fake news from members of the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee.  Representative Maxine Waters, the panel\u2019s fiery Democratic chair, quizzed Zuckerberg on Facebook\u2019s steps to combat misinformation and voter suppression ahead of the November 2020 U.S. presidential election. She also suggested policymakers should consider breaking up Facebook.  Waters had previously called for halting the Libra project before its planned 2020 launch, and has drafted legislation that would bar tech companies from entering financial services.  \u201cIt would be beneficial for all if Facebook concentrates on addressing its many existing deficiencies and failures before proceeding any further on the Libra project,\u201d Waters told Zuckerberg two days after Facebook disclosed it had removed a network of Russian accounts targeting U.S. voters on its Instagram platform.  BIPARTISAN CRITICISM  Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike blasted Facebook for failing to crack down on online child exploitation and political misinformation, and for data privacy lapses. Several said they did not trust Facebook to help provide financial services to its 2.4 billion users given the past scandals.  \u201cFacebook\u2019s internal model was for a long time was \u2018Move fast and break things.\u2019 Mr. Zuckerberg, we do not want to break the international monetary system,\u201d said Representative Nydia Velazquez, a Democrat.  Zuckerberg said Facebook would insist on U.S. regulatory approval before launching Libra, which is being established by a Switzerland-based consortium including venture capital firms and nonprofits. He said Facebook would even leave the Libra Association if other companies sought to launch the currency without that sign-off.  Slideshow ( 22 images )  Libra has faltered in recent weeks amid sustained criticism from lawmakers and regulators globally over fears it may aid money laundering and upend the global financial system. Several financial partners including Mastercard, Visa, PayPal and eBay have abandoned the project.  Representative Ann Wagner, a Republican, pressed Zuckerberg on why so many companies abandoned the Libra effort. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost these stable partners and I find it highly concerning,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy do a number of these founding members have concerns of whether you\u2019re up to the task of meeting our money laundering and regulatory standards?\u201d  The 35-year old Facebook CEO conceded that those companies dropped out because Libra is a \u201crisky project\u201d and that he was not sure it would even work. During his testimony, the price of bitcoin versus the U.S. dollar tumbled to a five-month low.  FACEBOOK HAS \u201cWORK TO DO\u201d  Calm and composed, Zuckerberg navigated the hostile room without major slip-ups and was even afforded a gentle rib by Democratic Representative Katie Porter, who complimented him on his short haircut.  The CEO last appeared before Congress in April 2018 when he fielded 10 hours of questions over two days from House and Senate panels on political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica\u2019s misuse of Facebook customer data to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  On Wednesday, he acknowledged Facebook\u2019s mistakes, saying he understood the social media giant was not the \u201cideal messenger\u201d for the Libra project and that the company has \u201cwork to do to build trust.\u201d But he said past missteps should not stand in the way of Libra, based in Switzerland.  \u201cThe vision here is to make it so that people can send money to each other as easily and cheaply as it is sending a text message.\u201d  Slideshow ( 22 images )  Zuckerberg was unable though to make material commitments on behalf of Libra because Facebook no longer controls the project, sometimes to the frustration of lawmakers.  On Oct. 14, the Libra Association comprising 21 members agreed articles of association laying out how the organization will be governed, as required by Swiss law. Most decisions will require a majority vote of the group\u2019s governing council, meaning Facebook will not call the shots.  Lawmakers also touched on other hot button issues, including diversity, inclusion, and charges brought by the housing regulator in March, still pending, alleging Facebook violated fair lending laws.  Representative Joyce Beatty, a Democrat, hammered Zuckerberg, saying she viewed Facebook\u2019s efforts to address civil rights abuses as insufficient, calling them \u201cappalling and disgusting.\u201d  Some Republicans did offer support for Zuckerberg and the Libra project, arguing the government should not stop the private sector from innovating.  \u201cI have my own qualms about Facebook and Libra and the shortcomings of Big Tech,\u201d said Representative Patrick McHenry, the top Republican on the panel. \u201cBut if history has taught us anything, it\u2019s better to be on the side of American innovation\u201d","927":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc FB.O on Wednesday announced the first 20 members of its independent oversight board that can overrule the company\u2019s own content moderation decisions. Here are some key facts about how the board will work:  FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen placed on a keyboard in this illustration taken March 25, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo  WHAT WILL THE OVERSIGHT BOARD REVIEW?  The board, which some have dubbed Facebook\u2019s \u201cSupreme Court,\u201d will rule on whether some individual pieces of content should be displayed on the site. It can also recommend changes to Facebook\u2019s content policy, based on a case decision or at the company\u2019s request.  At first, the board will review posts, videos, photos and comments that the company has decided to remove from Facebook or its photo-sharing site Instagram, but eventually it will handle cases where content was left up. This could be content involving issues such as nudity, violence or hate speech. Facebook has said the board\u2019s remit will in future include ads, groups, pages, profiles and events, but has not given a time frame.  It will not deal with Instagram direct messages, Facebook\u2019s messaging platforms WhatsApp, Messenger, its dating service or its Oculus virtual reality products.  Facebook expects the board will initially take on only \u201cdozens\u201d of cases, a small percentage of the thousands it expects will eventually be brought to the board. In 2019, users appealed more than 10 million pieces of content that Facebook removed or took action on.  But Facebook\u2019s head of global affairs, Nick Clegg, told Reuters he thought the cases chosen would have a wider relevance to patterns of content disputes.  HOW WILL THE BOARD WORK?  The board will decide which cases it reviews, which can be referred either by a user who has exhausted Facebook\u2019s normal appeals process or by Facebook itself for cases that might be \u201csignificant and difficult.\u201d  Users who disagree with Facebook\u2019s final decision on their content will have 15 days to submit a case to the board through the board\u2019s website.  Each case will be reviewed by a panel of five members, with at least one from the same geographic region as the case originated. The panel can ask for subject matter experts to help make its decision, which then must be finalized by the whole board.  The board\u2019s case decision - which is binding unless it could violate the law - must be made and implemented within 90 days, though Facebook can ask for a 30-day expedited review for exceptional cases, including those with \u201curgent real-world consequences.\u201d  Users will be notified of the board\u2019s ruling on their case and the board will publicly publish the decision.  When the board gives policy recommendations, Facebook will give public updates and publish a response on the guidance and follow-on action within 30 days.  For more details on the board's operations, see Facebook's proposed bylaws here.  WHO IS ON THE OVERSIGHT BOARD?  The board will eventually have about 40 members.  Facebook chose the four co-chairs - former U.S. federal circuit judge Michael McConnell and constitutional law expert Jamal Greene from the United States, Colombian attorney Catalina Botero-Marino and former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt - who then jointly selected the other 16 members named so far.  Some were sourced from the global consultations conducted by Facebook to obtain feedback on the oversight board.  The members, who will be part-time, so far include constitutional law experts, civil rights advocates, academics, journalists, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and a former judge of the European Court of Human Rights.  The members will be paid by a trust that Facebook has created and will serve three-year terms for a maximum of nine years.  The trustees can remove a member before the end of their term for violating the board\u2019s code of conduct, but not for content decisions.  Thomas Hughes, former executive director for freedom of expression rights group Article 19, has also been appointed to oversee the board\u2019s full-time administrative staff.","928":"FILE PHOTO: Stickers bearing the Facebook logo are pictured at Facebook Inc's F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S., April 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  (Reuters) - Shares of Facebook Inc rose nearly 5% on Thursday, a day after the social network reported its third straight rise in the pace of quarterly sales growth as well as an uptick in users in some of its most lucrative markets.  Wall Street analysts gave a more mixed reception to the earnings report, with at least nine analysts raising their price targets on the stock, while at least five trimmed.  But if the share gains hold through Thursday\u2019s session, it would translate to a nearly $26 billion gain in value for the Silicon Valley firm.

Facebook, the world\u2019s No. 2 seller of online ads, said that revenue would grow more slowly in the fourth quarter, at closer to about 20% to 25%, partly due to users choosing to limit the company\u2019s ability to target ads to them using personal details.  That did little to shake brokerages\u2019 faith in a business model that has generated stellar gains throughout the past two years, in counterpoint to growing pressure from politicians and regulators about privacy and competition.  \u201cWe remain confident in the strength of core usage trends and long-term opportunities from new monetization channels, even in the face of multiple distractions and political challenges,\u201d Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian said.","929":"Jan 28 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc's independent oversight board made its first binding decisions on Thursday, overruling the company's actions in four of the five cases it reviewed. here  The oversight board also made non-binding recommendations, calling for the company to make its content moderation policies clearer and more precise.  DECISIONS OVERTURNED: * A post from a user in Myanmar with photos of a deceased child that included commentary on China\u2019s treatment of Uighur Muslims. Facebook removed the post under its hate speech rules, but the board ruled the terms used were not derogatory or violent.  * An alleged quote from Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels that Facebook removed for violating its policy on \u201cdangerous individuals and organizations.\u201d The user said they intended to draw a comparison with the presidency of former U.S. President Donald Trump.  The board said the quote did not support Nazi ideology or acts. It said Facebook\u2019s rules were not sufficiently clear for users and called for the company to provide public examples of dangerous individuals and groups.  * A post in a group claiming certain drugs could cure COVID-19, which criticized the French government\u2019s response to the pandemic. This case was submitted by Facebook.  The board said Facebook\u2019s rule against misinformation that contributes to the risk of imminent physical harm was too vague. It also recommended Facebook create a new \u2018Community Standard\u2019 on health misinformation and that it should be \u201cless intrusive\u201d in enforcing policies where content does not risk imminent physical harm.  * Instagram photos showing female nipples that the user in Brazil said aimed to raise awareness of breast cancer symptoms. Facebook had also said this removal was an error and restored the post.  The board said that the incorrect, automated removal of this post indicated \u201cthe lack of proper human oversight which raises human rights concerns.\u201d It said Facebook should tell users when automated enforcement is used to moderate their content.  DECISION UPHELD: * A post that purported to show historical photos of churches in Baku, Azerbaijan, with a caption that Facebook said indicated \u201cdisdain\u201d for Azerbaijani people and support for Armenia.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Facebook and Twitter want to be like vibrant town squares, bustling with conversation and opinions of all stripes. Instead they look like swampy quagmires, where misinformation and bullying abound. Lawmakers and users are beginning to notice, but advertisers on the two social-media platforms have a higher tolerance for grime.  The uncomfortable moments are piling up. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told Recode last week he believes content related to Holocaust deniers shouldn\u2019t be removed from the platform, even if he thinks their views are wrong. Twitter boss Jack Dorsey defended his network after a New York Times political journalist said she was quitting the \u201canger video game\u201d \u2013 but he noted that it is not a place for nuanced conversation and needs to be fixed.  Advertisers are worried, but their concerns are quite specific. They want social-media companies\u2019 self-reported metrics about user engagement to be accurate, and they want to know their ads won\u2019t appear next to objectionable content. Facebook for example has removed more than 580 million fake accounts from January through March of this year. Earlier this month, Unilever\u2019s Chief Marketing Officer Keith Weed tweeted praise for Twitter\u2019s efforts to jettison false accounts.  And the revenue keeps rolling in. Facebook is expected to report a 44 percent year-over-year rise in second-quarter advertising revenue on Wednesday, representing a haul of some $13 billion, according to estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters. That growth rate comes despite Facebook\u2019s mishandling of user data and a raft of congressional hearings. Twitter too is enjoying a resurgence following six consecutive quarters of growth in its daily active-user numbers. Analysts are expecting the company to report more than a 20 percent increase in ad sales for the three months ending June 30.  Companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google \u2013 whose parent company Alphabet reported double-digit revenue growth on Monday \u2013 will keep talking about cleaning up the swamp. But the financial incentives point in a different direction. All three depend on advertising so people can use their platforms for free. In turn, advertisers want a large audience that spends lots of time online \u2013 and there aren\u2019t many places to find it. That means a big, deep pool of users \u2013 even a muddy one \u2013 is for now a reason to continue spending.","932":"FILE PHOTO: Silhouettes of mobile users are seen next to logos of social media apps Signal, Whatsapp and Telegram projected on a screen in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018.

Some privacy activists questioned the \u201caccept our data grab or get out\u201d move on Twitter, and suggested users to switch to apps like Signal and Telegram.

Slideshow ( 4 images )  Speaking at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, the closely-watched DoubleLine Capital LP chief executive officer recommended a pair trade of shorting, or betting against, Facebook while betting on gains in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks oil-and-gas explorers and producers who could benefit from rising inflation.  Facebook shares are down nearly 10 percent since the New York Times and London\u2019s Observer newspaper reported in mid-March that Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that worked on U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, gained inappropriate access to data on tens of millions of the social media company\u2019s users.  Gundlach said the worst likely is not over for Facebook, saying it is not unprecedented for equity bubbles being ended by regulation. Facebook\u2019s strengths are being redefined as weaknesses, he said.  \u201cWe hear the good things about Facebook, which is 2.2 billion users,\u201d said Gundlach, known as Wall Street\u2019s \u201cBond King.\u201d  \u201cI hear 2.2 billion compliance breaches.\u201d  Facebook shares were down 0.3 percent on Monday, giving up earlier gains.  Meanwhile, inflation is perking up and will likely continue to rise even if the U.S. economy is headed for a pullback, Gundlach said. That can be a boon for companies like those held in SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF, which Gundlach recommended buying in conjunction with the Facebook short.  Short-sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares in the hope of buying them back later at a lower price and pocketing the difference.  Gundlach\u2019s presentation revealed an investor preparing for the later stages of an economic expansion that has featured both low inflation and skyrocketing stock prices. But rising interest rates and the unwinding of the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet - what Gundlach characterizes as \u201cQuantitative Tightening\u201d - are changing the investment backdrop.  Last May, Gundlach, speaking at the same conference, recommended a comparable late-cycle trade of buying emerging market stocks and shorting the technology-led U.S. S&P 500 benchmark.  Emerging markets from China to Brazil are heavily, though not uniformly, influenced by commodity prices; as riskier assets, they tend to do better as economic growth cycles age. U.S. stocks and emerging markets both rose over the last year, but equities in developing markets led.  In addition to flashes of inflation building in economic statistics, oil prices have been among the best-performing major assets in 2018, with the major crude-futures benchmarks up more than 11 percent.  Trump on Friday accused the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries of \u201cartificially\u201d boosting oil prices, drawing rebukes from some of the world\u2019s top energy exporters.","935":"TORONTO, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Canada\u2019s privacy commissioner asked a federal court to declare that Facebook had broken federal privacy law for the private sector, according to a notice of application filed on Thursday.

Yet, Conze warned investors, Joyn will generate initial losses of around 100 million euros ($113 million) - split equally between the partners - and is expected to take years to turn a profit.  \u201cWe expect Joyn to achieve break-even in four to five years,\u201d he told ProSieben\u2019s annual general meeting in Munich.  Joyn - a mashup of \u2018joy\u2019 and \u2018join\u2019 - will be funded by advertising at first, and will host around 50 channels. These include public broadcaster ARD and Discovery\u2019s Eurosport, with many already available on cable in Germany.  The premium version of Joyn, expected to go live in the winter, would put ProSieben head to head with Netflix and Amazon Prime on subscription video-on-demand, where the U.S. streaming giants dominate.  ProSieben also said it had signed a cooperation agreement with social network Facebook to post clips on video platform Facebook Watch as it seeks to reach a younger audience.

The two tech companies followed Intel Corp INTC.O, Netflix Inc NFLX.O, Alphabet's GOOGL.O Google, International Business Machines Corp IBM.N and Nike Inc NKE.N in taking a public stance against Floyd's death - calling out discrimination against African-Americans.  But tech companies such as Facebook and Google for years have struggled to quell concerns about discrimination against African-Americans in their own workplaces, and black engineers remain underrepresented in their workforces relative to the U.S. population.  The challenges are not expected to ease as the novel coronavirus pandemic forces the companies to slow hiring and work remotely for months to come.  Facebook employees on Monday urged Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to take stronger action against an inflammatory post last week by U.S. President Donald Trump about the Minneapolis protests.  But Zuckerberg already said in a Friday post that Facebook would not take action on the post. He said Facebook will commit $10 million to organizations working on racial justice.  Floyd\u2019s death has renewed outrage across the U.S. on the treatment of African-Americans by authorities, polarizing the country politically and racially.  \u201cWe cannot end systemic racism without simultaneously creating opportunity for all people, regardless of their background,\u201d Snap Chief Executive Officer Evan Spiegel told employees in an email criticizing racism and calling for increased taxes \u201cto create a society that benefits all of us.\u201d  Twitter, which last week was at the center of a fight with Trump over its actions on his tweets, including a warning over one about the protests, added the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter to its account bio on the site.

On Friday, Nike flipped its iconic slogan to raise awareness about racism.  \"For Once, Don't Do It. Don't pretend there's not a problem in America.

It comes after Facebook has been heavily criticised by politicians and the public for its failure to more rapidly remove footage of the March shooting attack in Christchurch, New Zealand from its network. Fifty people were killed in the assault, with footage of it circulating online for days.  The French president, who will meet Facebook founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg later on Friday, wants France to take a leading role on tech regulation, seeking to strike a balance between what he perceives as the United States\u2019 laissez-faire stance and China\u2019s iron grip on the Internet.  The 33-page report, co-written by a former head of public affairs for Google France, recommends increasing oversight over the world\u2019s largest social media network and allowing an independent regulator to police the efforts of large tech companies to deal with hate speech.  The report comes after Facebook allowed a team of French regulators to spend six months inside the company monitoring its policies. It represents a \u201chalf-time\u201d assessment for their stint which started in January.  \u201cThe inadequacy and lack of credibility in the self-regulatory approach adopted by the largest platforms justify public intervention to make them more responsible,\u201d the report said.  Companies like Facebook cannot simply declare themselves to be transparent, it added, noting that checking the integrity of the algorithms they use was a particularly complex task.  HELPFUL PRIMER  Responding to the report, Facebook\u2019s vice president for policy, Richard Allan, said it was a helpful primer for the way forward and suggested there were grounds for cooperation.  \u201cThe report sets out a path towards a new model for content regulation that has the potential to be both effective and workable,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt would allow platforms to develop innovative solutions to keep their users safe while being clearly accountable to a regulator for how well they do this.\u201d  This week, Chris Hughes, one of the founders of Facebook with Zuckerberg while they were at Harvard, wrote in a long opinion piece in the New York Times that he believed the company was too powerful and needed to be broken up.  France\u2019s parliament, where Macron\u2019s ruling party has a comfortable majority, is debating legislation that would give the new regulator the power to fine tech companies up to 4% of their global revenue if they don\u2019t do enough to remove hateful content from their network.  \u201cOur goal is to move ... towards proper regulation,\u201d a source close to the Finance Ministry said.  Facebook\u2019s decision to allow the team of French regulators inside the company was the first time the wary company had opened its doors in such a way.

But the label disappeared once people shared the ads to their own feeds, which critics said undermined its utility and allowed misinformation to continue spreading unchecked.  \u201cPreviously the thinking here was that these were organic posts, and so these posts did not necessarily need to contain information about ads,\u201d said Sarah Schiff, a Facebook product manager overseeing the change.  After receiving feedback, Schiff said, the company now considers it important to disclose if a post \u201cwas at one point an ad.\u201d  Facebook introduced a similar labeling approach for state news media earlier this month, but that label also sometimes drops off with sharing and does not appear when users post their own links to those outlets.  The company is facing demands to do more to combat false viral information before the Nov. 3 presidential election, including by presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, who last week called on Zuckerberg to reverse his decision to exempt political ads from fact-checking.

REUTERS\/Elijah Nouvelage\/File Photo  A coalition of consumer groups asked the FTC to investigate whether Facebook had engaged in deceptive practices, claiming the company lured children into making extensive in-game purchases without parental consent.  The social media company settled a class-action lawsuit on the issue in 2016, but further details came to light last month after a request by the Center for Investigative Reporting here resulted in the unsealing of the court documents.  The documents disclosed that Facebook employees referred to the practice as \u201cfriendly fraud\u201d and called children who racked up thousands of dollars in charges \u201cwhales,\u201d a term commonly used in casinos to describe high-spending gamblers.  \u201cWe urge the FTC to review in detail the complaint that was filed today on this issue. It shouldn\u2019t take another settlement for Facebook to meet its ethical obligation to protect kids and families on its platform,\u201d Senators Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal said in a statement.  They said Facebook dodged their questions on the issue, posed to Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg in a letter last month after the documents were unsealed.  \u201cFacebook\u2019s answers to our reasonable questions were inadequate and do not inspire trust,\u201d they said.  Facebook said in a statement that it had mechanisms in place to prevent fraud and provided dedicated resources for refund requests related to purchases by children.  \u201cWe want people to have safe and enjoyable gaming experiences on Facebook, so providing resources to seek refunds for unauthorized purchases made in games is an important part of the platform,\u201d the statement added.

REUTERS\/Eric Gaillard\/File Photo  A joint motion by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation in U.S. District Court in Fresno, California argued that the public\u2019s right to know the state of the law on encryption outweighs any reason the U.S. Justice Department might have for protecting a criminal probe or law-enforcement method.  The issue arose in a joint federal and state investigation into activities of the MS-13 gang in Fresno, revolving around the end-to-end encryption Facebook uses to protect calls on its Messenger service from interception. End-to-end encryption means that only the two parties in the conversation have access to it.  Neither U.S. prosecutors nor Facebook have commented publicly about the Messenger case because of a court gag order. But Reuters reported in September that investigators failed in a courtroom effort to force Facebook to wiretap Messenger voice calls.  The motion said that although it is possible that other courts have faced similar issues in secret, the Fresno court in the Eastern District of California may be the first \u201cto rule on whether the federal government can force a private social media company to undermine its own security architecture to aid a criminal investigation.\u201d  \u201cThe functioning of our common-law system depends on courts making their opinions publicly accessible, so that litigants and judges may rely on each other\u2019s reasoning,\u201d the motion said.  It sought the release of the government\u2019s arguments and any ruling accepting or rejecting each of those arguments. It said the court could redact information about people that could hurt a criminal case.  To stress the importance of the encryption issue being aired, the rights groups compared the Facebook legal fight to a dispute in 2016. In that year, the FBI asked courts to force Apple to break into an iPhone owned by a slain sympathizer of Islamic State in San Bernardino, California, who had murdered county employees.  The Apple case also began in secret. But after it became public, it was central to the national debate about government\u2019s authority over tech companies.  End-to-end encryption also protects Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp, Signal\u2019s communications app and other services.  U.S. telecommunications companies are required to give police access to calls under federal law, but many apps that rely solely on internet infrastructure are exempt. Facebook contended Messenger was covered by that exemption, sources told Reuters.  Public court filings in the Fresno case showed the government was intercepting all ordinary phone calls and Messenger texts between the accused gang members.  An FBI affidavit cited three Messenger calls that investigators were unable to hear. The participants in those calls were arrested anyway.  One matter judges weigh in approving wiretap requests is how much of a burden it would be for the company to help. In contrast to WhatsApp and a separate part of Messenger called secret conversations, Facebook plays a small technical role facilitating Messenger voice calls, making interception possible with some effort.  Nevertheless, Facebook maintained it could not be ordered to alter its software or hack its users to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Tech industry lawyers have agreed. In one published commentary cited by the ACLU, three wrote that if the prosecution was relying on the requirements for general assistance in the All Writs Act, as it had in the Apple case, it would constitute \u201ca dramatic expansion of the government\u2019s authority to commandeer services in ways that interfere with their expected use.\u201d","958":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Soros Fund Management LLC added Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Twitter Inc, but trimmed stakes in Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc in the quarter through June, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday.

Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side.

FILE PHOTO: Silhouettes of mobile users are seen next to a screen projection of Facebook logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  As the largest social media service in nearly every big country, Facebook since 2016 has become a means for politicians and their adversaries to distribute fake news and other propaganda.  Buying Facebook ads can widen the audience for such material, but some of those influence efforts may violate election rules and the company\u2019s policies.  Under pressure from authorities around the world, Facebook last year introduced several initiatives to increase oversight of political ads.  Beginning on Wednesday in Nigeria, only advertisers located in the country will be able to run electoral ads, mirroring a policy unveiled during an Irish referendum last May, Katie Harbath, Facebook\u2019s director of global politics and outreach, said in an interview.  The same policy will take effect in Ukraine in February. Nigeria holds a presidential election on Feb. 16, while Ukraine will follow on March 31.  In India, which votes for parliament this spring, Facebook will place electoral ads in a searchable online library starting from next month, said Rob Leathern, a director of product management at the company.  \u201cWe\u2019re learning from every country,\u201d Leathern said. \u201cWe know we\u2019re not going to be perfect, but our goal is continuing, ongoing improvement.\u201d  Facebook believes that holding the ads in a library for seven years is a key part of fighting intereference, he added.  The library will resemble archives brought to the United States, Brazil and Britain last year.  The newfound transparency drew some applause from elected officials and campaign accountability groups, but they also criticized Facebook for allowing advertisers in the United States to obfuscate their identities.  The Indian archive will contain contact information for some ad buyers or their official regulatory certificates. For individuals buying political ads, Facebook said it would ensure their listed name matches government-issued documents.  The European Union would get a version of that authorization and transparency system ahead of the bloc\u2019s parliamentary elections in May, Leathern said.  The ad hoc approach, with varying policies and transparency depending on the region, reflects local laws and conversations with governments and civil society groups, Harbath said.  That means extra steps to verify identities and locations of political ad buyers in the United States and India will not be introduced in every big election this year, Leathern said.  In addition, ad libraries in some countries will not include what the company calls \u201cissue\u201d ads, Leathern said.  Facebook\u2019s U.S. archive includes ads about much-debated issues such as climate change and immigration policy even though they may not directly relate to a ballot measure.  Australia, Indonesia, Israel and the Philippines are among nations holding key votes this year for which Facebook said it is still weighing policies.  Leathern and Harbath said they hoped to have a set of tools that applies to advertisers globally by the end of June. They declined to elaborate, saying lessons from the next couple of months would help shape the worldwide product.  \u201cOur goal was to get to a global solution,\u201d Harbath said. \u201cAnd so, until we can get to that in June, we had to look at the different elections and what we think we can do.\u201d  Other Facebook teams remain focused on identifying problematic political behavior unrelated to ads.

Michael Reynolds\/Pool via REUTERS  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters Breakingviews) - Congress seems to love the Mark Zuckerberg show. The Facebook boss has been grilled by U.S. lawmakers six times in over two years, a high number of repeat visits for a top executive. Other Big Tech chiefs have also made multiple appearances. Yet politicians have failed to pass any new rules on privacy, content moderation or antitrust. The ineffective hearings cut at Congress\u2019s credibility.  Zuckerberg\u2019s latest turn in the D.C. spotlight came on Tuesday, where he sat virtually before the Senate. He was asked again about the 2012 acquisition of Instagram, and repeated his usual defense: that it wasn\u2019t obvious at that time that it would become the success that it did. He also asserted that Facebook isn\u2019t a publisher and advocated vague reforms to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that provides protection for content posted by users, two other positions he\u2019s pushed in the past.  Zuckerberg has perfected his stoic, matter of fact tone over several congressional appearances. It has helped him avoid gotcha moments that have tripped up other chief executives, like former Wells Fargo head John Stumpf. Likewise, Twitter boss Jack Dorsey in his fourth hearing before Congress, also spoke in a detached manner that differed from his first, more impassioned testimony in 2018.  Meanwhile, Congress has gone in the other direction. Both parties believe the companies have too much power, but sometimes lawmakers embarrass themselves by confusing technologies, like when Representative Steve King of Iowa and others asked Alphabet boss Sundar Pichai about Apple\u2019s iPhone.  Congress has a host of reasons it wants to rein in Facebook. In addition to antitrust concerns, content moderation came front and center during the 2020 election. That has led to louder calls to revamp or repeal Section 230 that provides the liability protection.  Zuckerberg first came to Congress in April 2018 after the Cambridge Analytica scandal about the misuse of user data and Russian interference in the 2016 election. Lawmakers have proposed a stream of bills addressing these issues, along with privacy. While the hearings are time-consuming, they\u2019ve been largely harmless for the chief executives. No real, actionable legislation has cracked down formally on the platforms.  Lawmakers have vowed to call the Big Tech bosses again next year in a new Congress. With partisan divisions becoming even sharper after the November election, the Washington legislators will continue to make themselves appear to have much more bark than bite.","963":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representative Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Friday that Facebook Inc has been part of the problem when it comes to election-related interference.  \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of Facebook.

REUTERS\/Antonio Bronic  Instagram and Facebook users see about the same number of ads, but Instagram ad prices are half of what Facebook charges because of the limited number of advertisers vying for spots on Instagram, four ad buyers said.  Investors have been counting on revenue from Instagram to overcome stalling usage of Facebook\u2019s core app. But the gap it has to fill has widened sooner than expected.  The social media company suffered the biggest one-day wipeout in U.S. stock market history, losing more than $120 billion in market capitalization as shares fell 19 percent a day after executives forecast years of lower profit margins due to regulatory pressure over privacy.  Instagram users are not accustomed to clicking on links in posts, which makes the service less effective at generating online purchases than Facebook, said Erik Huberman, founder of the ad buying agency Hawke Media.  Data about viewership of ads is lacking in comparison to Facebook, he added.  \u201cThere are fundamental issues with the platform...which means any type of modern marketer would be hesitant to increase spend on Instagram,\u201d Huberman said.  Some advertisers fond of Facebook are seeing subpar results on Instagram, according to advertising buyers. Others have been stymied by the higher bar for eye-catching content on Instagram and a general unease among advertisers about a newer service, the ad buyers said.  \u201cA lot of businesses don\u2019t put ads on Instagram because the reality is they don\u2019t have the content to play on Instagram,\u201d said David Herrmann, advertising director at Social Outlier, which spends nearly $15 million each quarter on Facebook ads on behalf of clients. \u201cA local flooring business is not going to appeal on Instagram, like on Facebook.\u201d  Instagram is its parent company\u2019s fastest-growing slice of revenue, but it touts 4 million fewer monthly advertisers globally. As Instagram has shown more ads, the average price per ad across Facebook\u2019s entire family of apps has declined in two straight quarters after a year of upswing. A new privacy law in Europe also has affected prices.  The latest results prompted Stifel, Nicolaus & Co analyst Scott Devitt to lower an Instagram revenue estimate for 2019 to $13 billion from $l4.64 billion, with lowered expectations for prices and views.  Instagram and Facebook declined to comment for this story.  Company executives have reason for optimism. The average price for an ad seen 1,000 times was $4.70 on Instagram during the second quarter, rising twice as fast as standard Facebook ads compared with the prior quarter, according to data tracked by marketing software firm Kenshoo.  Instagram has worked for advertisers seeking name recognition or posting attractive video content, such as movie trailers, said Mark Smith of the ad buying agency True Interactive, which spends $25 million annually on Facebook and Instagram for clients including Redbox and Montage Hotels.  New features for users and advertisers, including replicating an ad design tool rival Snap Inc launched last year, could help reduce the apprehension among other advertisers, said Chris Costello, Kenshoo\u2019s senior director of marketing research.  Earlier this year, Instagram introduced options that automatically formats advertisers\u2019 videos and let them have multiple photos in an ad. But companies still must have higher-quality content than on Facebook to get noticed, Costello said.  Tom Buontempo, president of ad agency Attention, said a first step is getting more companies to open free Instagram accounts, which is needed to advertise.  \u201cSurprisingly, there are still quite a few advertisers who haven\u2019t leveraged the potential of Instagram\u2019s ad products,\u201d he said.","966":"AMSTERDAM, April 21 (Reuters) - Adyen, the Amsterdam-based firm that handles the online payments backend for Facebook and Uber, said the coronavirus outbreak had impacted its margins, although revenues and core earnings continued to grow.

(Reporting by Conor Humprhies, editing by Padraic Halpin and Louise Heavens)","968":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - If a new European law restricting what companies can do with people\u2019s online data went into effect tomorrow, almost 1.9 billion Facebook Inc users around the world would be protected by it. The online social network is making changes that ensure the number will be much smaller.  Facebook members outside the United States and Canada, whether they know it or not, are currently governed by terms of service agreed with the company\u2019s international headquarters in Ireland.  Next month, Facebook is planning to make that the case for only European users, meaning 1.5 billion members in Africa, Asia, Australia and Latin America will not fall under the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which takes effect on May 25.  The previously unreported move, which Facebook confirmed to Reuters on Tuesday, shows the world\u2019s largest online social network is keen to reduce its exposure to GDPR, which allows European regulators to fine companies for collecting or using personal data without users\u2019 consent.  That removes a huge potential liability for Facebook, as the new EU law allows for fines of up to 4 percent of global annual revenue for infractions, which in Facebook\u2019s case could mean billions of dollars.  The change comes as Facebook is under scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world since disclosing last month that the personal information of millions of users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, setting off wider concerns about how it handles user data.  The change affects more than 70 percent of Facebook\u2019s 2 billion-plus members. As of December, Facebook had 239 million users in the United States and Canada, 370 million in Europe and 1.52 billion users elsewhere.  Facebook, like many other U.S. technology companies, established an Irish subsidiary in 2008 and took advantage of the country\u2019s low corporate tax rates, routing through it revenue from some advertisers outside North America. The unit is subject to regulations applied by the 28-nation European Union.  Facebook said the latest change does not have tax implications.  FILE PHOTO: Silhouettes of mobile users are seen next to a screen projection of Facebook logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File photo  \u2018IN SPIRIT\u2019  In a statement given to Reuters, Facebook played down the importance of the terms of service change, saying it plans to make the privacy controls and settings that Europe will get under GDPR available to the rest of the world.  \u201cWe apply the same privacy protections everywhere, regardless of whether your agreement is with Facebook Inc or Facebook Ireland,\u201d the company said.  Earlier this month, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told Reuters in an interview that his company would apply the EU law globally \u201cin spirit,\u201d but stopped short of committing to it as the standard for the social network across the world.  In practice, the change means the 1.5 billion affected users will not be able to file complaints with Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commissioner or in Irish courts. Instead they will be governed by more lenient U.S. privacy laws, said Michael Veale, a technology policy researcher at University College London.  Facebook will have more leeway in how it handles data about those users, Veale said. Certain types of data such as browsing history, for instance, are considered personal data under EU law but are not as protected in the United States, he said.  The company said its rationale for the change was related to the European Union\u2019s mandated privacy notices, \u201cbecause EU law requires specific language.\u201d For example, the company said, the new EU law requires specific legal terminology about the legal basis for processing data which does not exist in U.S. law.  NO WARNING  Ireland was unaware of the change. One Irish official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he did not know of any plans by Facebook to transfer responsibilities wholesale to the United States or to decrease Facebook\u2019s presence in Ireland, where the social network is seeking to recruit more than 100 new staff.  Facebook released a revised terms of service in draft form two weeks ago, and they are scheduled to take effect next month.  Other multinational companies are also planning changes. LinkedIn, a unit of Microsoft Corp, tells users in its existing terms of service that if they are outside the United States, they have a contract with LinkedIn Ireland. New terms that take effect May 8 move non-Europeans to contracts with U.S.-based LinkedIn Corp.  LinkedIn said in a statement on Wednesday that all users are entitled to the same privacy protections. \u201cWe\u2019ve simply streamlined the contract location to ensure all members understand the LinkedIn entity responsible for their personal data,\u201d the company said.","969":"March 23 (Reuters) -  * FACEBOOK EXECS.

Facebook declined to act on the same message, and Zuckerberg sought to distance his company from the fight between the president and Twitter. He maintained that while he found Trump\u2019s remarks \u201cdeeply offensive,\u201d they did not violate company policy against incitements to violence.  Twitter last week also put a fact-checking label on two Trump tweets containing misleading claims about mail-in ballots.

The proposed class-action settlement was disclosed by Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer on a Wednesday conference call to discuss fourth-quarter results, and by lawyers for Facebook users who called it the largest cash settlement of a privacy lawsuit.  Facebook did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement, which requires court approval.  The accord followed Facebook\u2019s $5 billion settlement last year with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which arose from the company\u2019s having allowed British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to harvest data for an estimated 87 million users.

Facebook denied that and said the data access was to allow its users to access account features on mobile devices.  More than half of the partnerships have already been wound down, Facebook said. It said on Tuesday it would end the Huawei agreement later this week. It is ending the other three partnerships with Chinese firms as well.  Chinese telecommunications companies have come under scrutiny from U.S. intelligence officials who argue they provide an opportunity for foreign espionage and threaten critical U.S. infrastructure, something the Chinese have consistently denied.  Senator Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, who asked Facebook if Huawei was among the companies that received user data, said in a statement that the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee had raised concerns about Huawei dating back in 2012.  \u201cThe news that Facebook provided privileged access to Facebook\u2019s API to Chinese device makers like Huawei and TCL raises legitimate concerns, and I look forward to learning more about how Facebook ensured that information about their users was not sent to Chinese servers,\u201d Warner said.  API, or application program interface, essentially specifies how software components should interact.  A Facebook executive said the company had carefully managed the access it gave to the Chinese companies.  \u201cFacebook along with many other U.S. tech companies have worked with them and other Chinese manufacturers to integrate their services onto these phones,\u201d Francisco Varela, vice president of mobile partnerships for Facebook, said in a statement. \u201cFacebook\u2019s integrations with Huawei, Lenovo, OPPO and TCL were controlled from the get-go \u2014 and we approved the Facebook experiences these companies built.\u201d  Varela added that \u201cgiven the interest from Congress, we wanted to make clear that all the information from these integrations with Huawei was stored on the device, not on Huawei\u2019s servers.\u201d  RESPONSE DEMANDED FROM ZUCKERBERG  Earlier on Tuesday, the Senate Commerce Committee demanded that Facebook\u2019s chief executive officer, Mark Zuckerberg, respond to a report that user data was shared with at least 60 device manufacturers, weeks after the social media company said it would change its practices after a political firm got access to data from millions of users.  Senators John Thune, the committee\u2019s Republican chairman, and Bill Nelson, the ranking Democrat, on Tuesday wrote to Zuckerberg after The New York Times reported that manufacturers were able to access data of users\u2019 friends even if the friends denied permission to share the information with third parties.  In April, the Federal Communications Commission proposed new rules that would bar purchases by government programs from companies that it says pose a security threat to U.S. telecoms networks, a move aimed at Huawei and ZTE Corp, China\u2019s No. 2 telecommunications equipment maker. The Pentagon in May ordered retail outlets on U.S. military bases to stop selling Huawei and ZTE phones, citing potential security risks.  ZTE was not among the firms that received access to Facebook data, but it has been the subject of U.S. national security concerns.  The letter asks if Facebook audited partnerships with the device manufacturers under a 2011 consent order with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). It also asked if Zuckerberg wanted to revise his testimony before the Senate in April.  Facebook said it looks forward to addressing any questions the Commerce Committee has.  Facebook still has not answered hundreds of written questions submitted from members of Congress after Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony in April, according to congressional staff.  The data sharing mentioned in the Times story was used over the last decade by about 60 companies, including Amazon.com Inc , Apple Inc, Blackberry Ltd, HTC Corp , Microsoft Corp and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Ime Archibong, Facebook vice president of product partnerships, wrote in a blog post on June 3.  The FTC confirmed in March that it was investigating Facebook\u2019s privacy practices.  Facebook allowed Apple and other device makers to have \u201cdeep\u201d access to users\u2019 personal data without their consent, according to the Times.  The Times said Facebook allowed companies access to the data of users\u2019 friends without their explicit consent, even after it had declared it would no longer share the information with outsiders.  Archibong said the data was only shared with device makers in order to improve Facebook users\u2019 access to the information. \u201cThese partners signed agreements that prevented people\u2019s Facebook information from being used for any other purpose than to recreate Facebook-like experiences.\u201d  Regulators and authorities in several countries have increased scrutiny of Facebook after it failed to protect the data of some 87 million users that was shared with now-defunct political data firm Cambridge Analytica.  Two Democrats on the Senate Commerce Committee, Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal, on Monday also wrote to Zuckerberg.  Archibong said the cases were \u201cvery different\u201d from the use of data by third-party developers in the Cambridge row.  New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood said on Monday the \u201cdata-sharing partnerships with other corporations\u201d is part of the ongoing investigation into the reported misuse of Facebook user data by Cambridge Analytica.

FILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is displayed on a smartphone in this illustration taken January 6, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The world\u2019s biggest social media company removed about 4.7 million posts connected to hate organizations on its flagship app in the first quarter, up from 1.6 million in the 2019 fourth quarter. It also deleted 9.6 million posts containing hate speech, compared with 5.7 million in the prior period.  That marks a six-fold increase in hateful content removals since the second half of 2017, the earliest period for which Facebook discloses data.  The company also said it put warning labels on about 50 million pieces of content related to COVID-19, after taking the unusually aggressive step of banning harmful misinformation about the new coronavirus at the start of the pandemic.  \u201cWe have a good sense that these warning labels work. Ninety-five percent of the time that someone sees content with a label, they don\u2019t click through to view that content,\u201d Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told reporters on a press call.  Facebook released the data as part of its fifth Community Standards Enforcement Report, which it introduced in 2018 along with more stringent decorum rules in response to a backlash over its lax approach to policing content on its platforms. These include Facebook\u2019s Messenger and WhatApp mobile apps.  It expanded the report last year to include information about how it enforces rules on photo-sharing app Instagram and said on Tuesday it would begin releasing the data on a quarterly basis.  In a blog post announcing the report, Facebook highlighted improvements to its \u201cproactive detection technology,\u201d which uses artificial intelligence to detect violating content as it is posted and remove it before other users can see it.  \u201cWe\u2019re now able to detect text embedded in images and videos in order to understand its full context, and we\u2019ve built media matching technology to find content that\u2019s identical or near-identical to photos, videos, text and even audio that we\u2019ve already removed,\u201d the statement said.  Improvements to that technology also enabled the proactive removal of more drug-related and sexually exploitative content, the company said.  With fewer moderators available during the pandemic, Facebook has relied more on automated tools to police content as conspiracy theories about the coronavirus have spread online.  On the call, Zuckerberg said contractors in some parts of the world were starting to return to their offices, but cautioned that the coronavirus adjustments were likely to have a heavier impact on the data in the second quarter.  Cindy Otis, a disinformation researcher and former CIA analyst, noted that coronavirus-related abuse likewise spiked in April, after the period covered in the report.  She urged Facebook to disclose how quickly it removes posts, a key indicator of the effectiveness of its systems, as it often appears to act only after content has gone viral and spread to other platforms.  \u201cThe pandemic has been the largest event in disinformation and misinformation history,\u201d she said, \u201cand that does not appear to show in their numbers they provide.\u201d","980":"A federal judge has dismissed for the second time a lawsuit by investors accusing Facebook Inc and its top executives of concealing fallout from a massive privacy breach, but has left room for them to amend their case with a new allegation about the company\u2019s link to President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.  U.S. District Judge Edward Davila in San Jose, California, ruled Friday that, without the new allegation, the investors had failed to allege any false statements by Facebook, its chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, its chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg or its chief financial officer David Wehner that led to losses.

The move tightens the regulatory screws on the online platforms, which have governments from the United States to Europe scrambling to address concerns ranging from anti-trust issues to the spread of \u201cfake news\u201d and hate speech.  Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the $5 billion fine slapped on Facebook in the United States this month for privacy breaches showed regulators were now taking such issues extremely seriously.  \u201cThese companies are among the most powerful and valuable in the world,\u201d Frydenberg told reporters in Sydney after the release of a much-anticipated report on future regulation of the dominant digital platforms.  \u201cThey need to be held to account and their activities need to be more transparent.\u201d  Canberra would form a special branch of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the antitrust watchdog, to scrutinize how the companies used algorithms to match advertisements with viewers, giving them a stronghold on the main income generator of media operators.  The new office was one of 23 recommendations in the ACCC\u2019s report, including strengthening privacy laws, protections for the news media and a code of conduct requiring regulatory approval to govern how internet giants profit from users\u2019 content.  Frydenberg said the government intended to \u201clift the veil\u201d on the closely guarded algorithms the firms use to collect and monetize users\u2019 data, and accepted the ACCC\u2019s \u201coverriding conclusion that there is a need for reform\u201d.  The proposals would be subject to a 12-week public consultation process before the government acts on the report, he added.  Google and Facebook have opposed tighter regulation while traditional media owners, including Rupert Murdoch's News Corp NWSA.O, have backed reform.  News Corp\u2019s local executive chairman, Michael Miller, welcomed the \u201cstrength of the language and the identification of the problems\u201d, and said the publisher would work with the government to ensure \u201creal change\u201d.  Facebook and Google said they would engage with the government during the consultation process, but had no comment on the specific recommendations.  The firms have previously rejected the need for tighter regulation and said the ACCC had underestimated the level of competition for online advertising.

He said he was shocked at the amount of personal data the firms collected, often without users\u2019 knowledge.  \u201cThere needs to be a lot more transparency and oversight of Google and Facebook and their operations and practices,\u201d he said.  Among other recommendations in the report, the ACCC said it wanted privacy law updated to give people the right to erase personal data stored online, aligning Australia with some elements of the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation.  \u201cWe cannot leave these issues to be dealt with by commercial entities with substantial reach and market power. It\u2019s really up to government and regulators to get up to date and stay up to date in relation to all these issues,\u201d Sims said.  While the regulator did not recommend breaking up the tech giants, Sims also did not rule it out.  \u201cIf it turns out that ... divestiture is a better approach, then that can always be recommended down the track,\u201d he said.","984":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  BERLIN (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar will make up 50% of the basket of currencies backing Facebook\u2019s planned digital coin Libra, with the euro, yen, sterling and Singapore dollar comprising the rest, Der Spiegel reported, referring to a letter from Facebook.  China\u2019s yuan currency will not be included, which could help smooth the planned cryptocurrency\u2019s path in the United States, where officials have raised concerns about the yuan\u2019s growing stature as a reserve currency at a time when trade relations between the two economic powers are tense.  In a letter responding to a question from German legislator Fabio De Masi, Facebook said the dollar would make up 50% of the basket, followed by the euro with 18%, the yen with 14%, the British pound with 11% and the Singapore dollar with 7%, according to German news magazine Der Spiegel.  Calls by Reuters to De Masi, the legislator who received the letter, were not immediately returned.

Regulators around the world have reacted with extreme wariness to the proposal, with central bankers warning they could have a destabilizing effect on the global financial system.","985":"SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian regulator is considering letting internet users choose what personal data companies like Google share with advertisers, as part of the country\u2019s attempts to shatter the dominance of tech titans.  The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) also proposed limiting the internet giants\u2019 ability to access users\u2019 online histories to cross-sell products.  The proposals were part of the ACCC\u2019s interim report into digital advertising in Australia, a A$3.4 billion ($2.6 billion) market the regulator said is marked by a lack of competition, transparency and choice.  The ACCC estimates Google\u2019s share of Australian digital advertising revenue at between 50% and 100%, depending on the service.  \u201cGoogle is the only one that can determine the effectiveness of ads, so really often they\u2019re marking their own homework when it comes to the effectiveness of the ads they supply,\u201d ACCC chair Rod Sims told Reuters in a telephone interview.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot wrong with the market ... and it\u2019s effectively dominated by one player,\u201d he added.  The proposals add a new element to the antitrust regulator\u2019s campaign to check the power of online behemoths Google and Facebook Inc in Australia.  Proposals by the ACCC that Google pay local media for content that drives traffic to their websites have been adopted in draft legislation by the government. Google has criticised the planned News Media Bargaining Code, threatening to pull its search engine from Australia if they go ahead.  In Thursday\u2019s 222-page digital advertising report, the regulator also suggested a system under which users\u2019 personal data would be shared more widely with advertisers, on an anonymised basis, to foster more competition.  Allowing internet users to choose to give other parties access to their clicking data may also promote competition among online advertising suppliers, the ACCC said.  Preventing tech companies from using data collected in one scenario to sell advertising in an unrelated field would also reduce the ability of a single player to dominate the digital ad market, the report added.  The regulator is accepting submissions for the next month ahead of a final report due in August. The government will then decide whether to make its recommendations law.  A Google spokesman said the company\u2019s advertising service \u201chelps businesses connect with customers and publishers reach new audiences, creating new growth and revenue opportunities for them\u201d.

Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg noted the ACCC\u2019s \u201cconcerns over competitiveness and the continued dominance of tech giants\u201d but did not say whether he supported the proposals.  SEARCH EXIT  Sims said he was not surprised by Google\u2019s threat to pull its search platform if the media laws went ahead.  \u201cIf you want to come up with good public policy on these issues you\u2019re bound to be getting companies to do things they don\u2019t want to do,\u201d he said.  Hannah Marshall, a partner at Marque Lawyers who specialises in competition law and media, told Reuters she expected Google and Facebook to start withdrawing services if the law went ahead.  \u201cWhile this requirement to pay to link to news content remains in the code, I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s going to be a resolution that works,\u201d she said.  \u201cIf enacted in its current form, Google and Facebook are likely to make good on their threats and that will kind of start a chain reaction of bad consequences for a lot of people in Australia, not only the news publishers.\u201d","986":"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will force Facebook Inc FB.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google to share advertising revenue with local media firms, the country's treasurer said on Monday, becoming one of the first countries to require digital platforms to pay for content they use.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the move comes after talks with Facebook and Alphabet failed to yield a voluntary code to address complaints by domestic media players that the tech giants have too tight a grip on advertising, their main source of income.  \u201cWe understand the challenge that we face, this is a big mountain to climb,\u201d Frydenberg told reporters in Canberra. \u201cThese are big companies that we are dealing with but there is also so much at stake, so we\u2019re prepared for this fight.\u201d  The government has now asked the country\u2019s competition watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to frame a mandatory code of conduct between media outlets and digital platforms after talks stalled on content payment rules.  The government scrapped its initial plan to come up with a voluntary code by November and has asked ACCC to submit its draft mandatory code by July, to be passed into legislation shortly thereafter, the treasurer said.  Frydenberg said the mandatory code will include sharing of data, ranking and display of news content and the sharing of revenue generated from news, adding that it would also establish penalty and binding dispute resolution mechanisms.  Australia\u2019s online advertising market is worth about almost A$9 billion ($5.72 billion) a year and has grown more than eight-fold since 2005.  For every A$100 spent on online advertising in Australia, excluding classifieds, nearly a third goes to Google and Facebook, an ACCC report on digital platforms published in June last year showed.  Last December, Australia said Google and Facebook would have to agree to new rules to ensure they do not abuse their market power and damage competition, or the government would impose new controls.  Facebook expressed dismay at the government move on Monday.  \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed by the government\u2019s announcement, especially as we\u2019ve worked hard to meet their agreed deadline,\u201d Facebook said.  \u201cWe\u2019ve invested millions of dollars locally to support Australian publishers through content arrangements, partnerships and training for the industry,\u201d Facebook Australia and New Zealand Managing Director Will Easton said in an emailed statement.

Monday\u2019s move also comes as the new coronavirus pandemic hits Australia\u2019s media business hard, with several regional outlets reporting steep declines in advertising revenue.

Analysts said the departure of Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger may have been the result of friction with Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg over how Facebook\u2019s fastest-growing revenue generator is run.  \u201cOur sense is the duo may have wanted to run Instagram more independently than their parent company wanted,\u201d said Scott Kessler, an analyst at research firm CFRA.  \u201cWe think (the) departures are a notable negative for Facebook.\u201d  The sudden loss of the pair follows the departures of WhatsApp co-founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton and a reshuffling of Facebook\u2019s executive ranks earlier this year.  A Bloomberg report said Systrom and Krieger had been frustrated by a rise in the day-to-day involvement of Zuckerberg, who has become more reliant on Instagram in planning for Facebook\u2019s future.  Facebook\u2019s shares were down 2.4 percent at $161.51 in early trading, knocking more than $11 billion off the stock\u2019s market value.  \u201cTo the extent that their departures represent Zuckerberg exercising more power and being less accountable, such a development would underscore the need for an independent board chair,\u201d said Jonas Kron, senior vice president at Trillium Asset Management.  The institutional investor, which holds more than 52,000 shares in Facebook, urged Facebook in July to appoint an independent board chair to oversee management.  Systrom wrote in a blog post on Monday that he and Krieger planned to take time off and explore \u201cour curiosity and creativity again\u201d.  Zuckerberg described the two as \u201cextraordinary product leaders\u201d and said he wished them all the best and was looking forward to seeing what they build next.  Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion. Instagram had been hailed in Silicon Valley as a flashy acquisition done right, with the team kept relatively small and Systrom having the freedom to add features such as peer-to-peer messaging, video uploads and advertising.  Instagram has over 1 billion active monthly users, a sharp rise from the 30 million users when Facebook bought the app.  Facebook\u2019s shares are currently down about 6 percent this year, following six years of stellar gains.  Concerns over the fallout of the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal and signals that a rise in costs would hurt Facebook\u2019s margins for years, fueled the biggest one-day wipeout in U.S. stock market history in July.","998":"RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec 3 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Cases of children working for major food delivery apps in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic have been uncovered by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, with prosecutors vowing to investigate amid growing scrutiny of employment practices in the gig economy.  Videos and posts on YouTube and Facebook and interviews with underage workers and researchers showed how Rappi, iFood, 99Food and Uber Eats had failed to stop child labor, with under-18s using older relatives\u2019 accounts or signing up under their names.  School closures and job losses caused by the pandemic have driven more children to work in the informal economy, according to activists. A United Nations survey in Sao Paulo of about 52,745 families found child labor rose by 26% from May to July.  A bicycle and a smartphone are all that are needed for children to tap into the growing demand for food deliveries, while social media sites are awash with advice on how to sign up and work while circumventing the delivery apps\u2019 identity checks.  Brazil\u2019s top prosecutor on child labor, Ana Maria Villa Real, said the issue was \u201cvery serious\u201d and officials planned to launch a rare investigation into underage delivery app workers.  \u201c(The companies) must be more vigilant in the selection of workers, so not to allow this outrageous (use of child labor).\u201d  The Thomson Reuters Foundation spoke to two boys, aged 16 and 17, who said they had worked for iFood, Rappi and Uber Eats.  One of them, Eduardo, signed up to iFood and Rappi in July, months after his school closed due to COVID-19. The 16-year-old used the details and documents of his mother and older siblings.  On a good day, Eduardo said he could earn up to 50 reais ($9.40). But a minor bicycle accident in September shook his confidence and he wants to stop working when schools reopen.  \u201cThis (work) is not good for anyone,\u201d he said in Pra\u00e7a Varnhagen, a public square in Rio de Janeiro surrounded by restaurants. \u201cI just want something better than this.\u201d  LEGAL LIABILITY  In response to the findings, the four named delivery apps voiced their opposition to child labor and outlined measures to identify fraudulent accounts. The companies said that children using other people\u2019s details to sign up amounted to fraud.  Uber Eats, a unit of ride-hailing app Uber Technologies , said it had deleted several accounts, notified authorities and would work with them to probe potential fraud.  99Food, controlled by China\u2019s Didi Chuxing Technology Co Ltd, said it was reviewing the documentation of its workforce.  iFood, controlled by Brazilian tech firm Movile, said all complaints about workers under 18 were investigated internally.  Bogota-based Rappi, which operates in nine Latin American countries, said it did not assume responsibility for false details or documents provided by gig workers on its platform.  iFood, Rappi and UberEats all said they combated fraud on their platforms by making gig workers take selfies during shifts and using facial recognition software to verify users. 99Food said it would launch a similar identification system this year.  Yet the safeguard is easy to exploit, gig workers said. When the request pops up, children can ask the account owner to take a photo for them. If someone gets banned from an app, they can sign up again using the details of another relative or friend.  Villa Real said the delivery apps were liable for underage workers and that a court could compel them to pay damages to the children, the state, and improve their anti-child labor efforts.  Three law professors, however, had varying views on the liability of the firms.  Leandro Antunes of Ibmec University shared Villa Real\u2019s opinion, while his colleague Juliano Barra said the companies were in fact victims of fraud and that they should notify prosecutors of any cases of child labor on their platforms.  Olivia Pasqualeto of FGV University said it was a grey area as the children didn\u2019t have a direct relationship with the apps.  This echoed a concern among labor activists globally that the growing gig economy - which is characterized by short-term contracts or freelance work - is exercising more control over workers while leaving them with no protection or legal recourse.  \u201cPRECARIOUS, NOT SUSTAINABLE\u201d  In Brazil, children under 18 are allowed to work in some circumstances but not permitted to do hazardous jobs. Officials said delivering food by bicycle would be considered dangerous.  President Jair Bolsonaro has said child labor is not harmful, reflecting a common belief among the public that it is better for children to work than be involved in drugs or crime.  About 2.4 million children work in Brazil - both legally and illegally - according to the latest government data from 2016.  Last year, the nation\u2019s hotline for human rights violations received 4,245 calls related to children being abused or exploited while working - marking a 10% increase from 2018.  Yet data on children in the gig economy in Brazil is scarce, said several academics and researchers who study labor issues.  In 2019, Alian\u00e7a Bike, a cyclists\u2019 association, interviewed 270 delivery workers in Sao Paulo for a study on gig workers who use a bicycle to deliver food. Three were found to be underage.  \u201cThese kids are kind of adrift,\u201d said Lucas Bravo, one of the organization\u2019s researchers. \u201cThey have peak hours for orders, but between these hours they have nothing to do.\u201d  In a separate study, Guilherme Minarelli, a social scientist at the University of Sao Paulo (USP), spent six months studying the gig economy in the state. He encountered several underage delivery app workers and interviewed two boys aged 16 and 17.  Many gig workers in the state who live in favelas must often cycle up to 50 km (30 miles) to reach food delivery hotspots, according to Minarelli. Some workers, among them children, sleep in parks after work to avoid cycling home and back, he added.  \u201cIt\u2019s precarious, (it\u2019s) not sustainable,\u201d Minarelli said.  More than 1,000 gig workers protested in S\u00e3o Paulo in July to call for better pay and health measures, and said they risked being blocked by the apps if they refused to work longer hours.  TIPS ON SOCIAL MEDIA  Dozens of public and private Facebook groups related to gig workers contain posts where children talk about signing up to the apps using the identity documents of friends and relatives. Several public videos on YouTube offer guidance on how to do so.  \u201cI\u2019m here to help all of you who are minors and want to work for Uber Eats,\u201d said a boy who claims to be 15 in a video posted on YouTube last year. It is no longer on YouTube but other videos showing the teenager delivering food are still online.  In these videos, he can be seen delivering for 99Food and Uber Eats. One of them has amassed at least 250,000 views. 99Food said it had found and banned the account he was using.  Another food delivery app worker turned YouTuber - a 29-year-old who posted a video advising minors on how to sign up - said he would allow his 15-year-old nephew to use his account.  \u201c(My nephew) lives in one of the most dangerous favelas in Rio,\u201d he said on condition of anonymity. \u201cDoing deliveries would be a luxury, a lot less dangerous than staying in the slums.\u201d  The Labor Prosecutor\u2019s Office said it would speak to Google and Facebook about how best to track such posts and videos.  Facebook did not respond to a request for comment about various posts by children discussing working for the apps.  Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google - which owns YouTube - said it would only remove videos that did not violate its user policy if the request came from Brazil\u2019s judiciary, not the public.  Labor prosecutors in Brazil have investigated several food delivery apps this year over working conditions in general, yet only a handful of probes to-date have focused on child workers.  Ludmila Abilio, a researcher at the University of Campinas - or Unicamp - who has studied the gig economy for over a decade, said the delivery apps had an unprecedented wealth of data at their disposal to monitor their workforce and tackle the issue.  \"I'm not sure if they are interested in creating programs to stop young people from entering this market,\" Abilio said. \"For now, it seems their only interest is that deliveries get made.\" (Reporting by Fabio Teixeira @ffctt; Editing by Kieran Guilbert and Belinda Goldsmith.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam\/File Photo  In a 57-page decision on Thursday, which followed a one-day trial in March, Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of the Delaware Chancery Court said shareholders demonstrated a \u201ccredible basis\u201d to believe Facebook board members may have committed wrongdoing related to data privacy breaches.  Slights noted that Facebook had at the time of the 2015 Cambridge Analytica breach been subject to a U.S. Federal Trade Commission consent decree that required it to bolster its data security measures. The breach was not revealed until March 2018.  \u201cEvidence presented at trial provides a credible basis to infer the board and Facebook senior executives failed to oversee Facebook\u2019s compliance with the consent decree and its broader efforts to protect the private data of its users,\u201d Slights wrote.  Shareholders sued Facebook last September to obtain records related to Cambridge Analytica and other breaches, and said that upon finding wrongdoing, they might sue company officers and directors through a so-called derivative lawsuit.  Derivative lawsuits are brought on behalf of companies, with money recovered from officers and directors, or their insurers, going to the companies themselves.  Facebook declined to comment on Friday. Daniel Rehns, a lawyer for the shareholders, also declined to comment.  Facebook\u2019s share price sank 19%, wiping out $120 billion of shareholder wealth, last July 26 after the Menlo Park, California company posted disappointing results in the first full quarter since the Cambridge Analytica breach was revealed, and said it was spending more on security measures.  Cambridge Analytica, hired by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign, used profiling techniques to predict and influence voter behavior.  It shut down after the breach was disclosed, and several U.S. and European regulatory probes into Facebook ensued.  Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told a U.S. Senate panel in April 2018 that his company discovered the Cambridge Analytica breach in 2015, but neither conducted an audit nor told users and the FTC, Slights wrote.  Slights denied some of the shareholders\u2019 record requests as over broad.

But, in a statement, MSCI said it \u201cdetermined that it is appropriate to give further consideration to the full breadth of views expressed by the investment community before announcing a final conclusion.\u201d (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf)","1003":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg is planning to unify the underlying messaging infrastructure of the WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger services and incorporate end-to-end encryption into these apps, the New York Times reported on Friday.  The three services will, however, continue as stand-alone apps, the report said, citing four people involved in the effort.  Facebook said it is working on adding end-to-end encryption, which protects messages from being viewed by anyone except the participants in a conversation, to more of its messaging products, and considering ways to make it easier for users to connect across networks.  \u201cThere is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work,\u201d a spokesperson said.  After the changes, a Facebook user, for instance, will be able send an encrypted message to someone who has only a WhatsApp account, according to the New York Times report.  Integrating the messaging services could make it harder for antitrust regulators to break up Facebook by undoing its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, said Sam Weinstein, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.  \u201cIf Facebook is worried about that then one way it can defend itself is to integrate those services,\u201d Weinstein said.  WhatsApp and Facebook messenger icons are seen on an iPhone in Manchester , Britain March 27, 2017. REUTERS\/Phil Noble  But Weinstein said breaking up Facebook is viewed as an \u201cextreme remedy\u201d by regulators, particularly in the United States, so concerns over antitrust scrutiny may not have been a factor behind the integration.  MAJOR TRADEOFFS  Some former Facebook security engineers and an outside encryption expert said the plan could be good news for user privacy, in particular by extending end-to-end encryption.  \u201cI\u2019m cautiously optimistic it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d said former Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos, who now teaches at Stanford University. \u201cMy fear was that they were going to drop end-to-end encryption.\u201d  However, the technology does not always conceal metadata - information about who is talking to whom - sparking concern among some researchers that the data might be shared.  Any metadata integration likely will let Facebook learn more about users, linking identifiers such as phone numbers and email addresses for those using the services independently of each other.  Facebook could use that data to charge more for advertising and targeted services, although it also would have to forgo ads based on message content in Messenger and Instagram.  Other major tradeoffs will have to be made too, Stamos and others said.  Messenger allows strangers to contact people without knowing their phone numbers, for example, increasing the risk of stalking and approaches to children.  Systems based on phone numbers have additional privacy concerns, because governments and other entities can easily extract location information from them.  Stamos said he hoped Facebook would get public input from terrorism experts, child safety officers, privacy advocates and others and be transparent in its reasoning when it makes decisions on the details.  \u201cIt should be an open process, because you can\u2019t have it all,\u201d Stamos said.","1004":"FILE PHOTO - Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook and current chair of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT), gives a news conference on the sidelines during the 2019 United Nations Climate Action Summit at U.N. headquarters in New York City, New York, U.S., September 23, 2019.

Khan, in an open letter posted on Twitter on Sunday, said \u201cgrowing Islamophobia\u201d was encouraging extremism and violence worldwide, especially through social media platforms such as Facebook.  \u201cI would ask you to place a similar ban on Islamophobia and hate against Islam for Facebook that you have put in place for the Holocaust,\u201d Khan said.  This month, Facebook said it was updating its hate speech policy to ban content that denied or distorted the Holocaust.  \u201cOne cannot send a message that while hate messages against some are unacceptable, these are acceptable against others,\u201d Khan said, adding such a stance was \u201creflective of prejudice and bias that will encourage further radicalisation\u201d.  In response, a Facebook spokeswoman told Reuters the company opposed all forms of hate and did not allow attacks based on race, ethnicity, national origin or religion.  \u201cWe\u2019ll remove this hate speech as soon as we become aware of it,\u201d the spokeswoman said in a statement, adding that Facebook had \u201cmore work to do\u201d.  Facebook\u2019s last transparency report for the six months to December 2019, showed that Pakistan was the source of the second highest number of requests to curb content after Russia.  A source with direct knowledge of the issue at Facebook told Reuters that the most requests for the removal of content relating to Islam came from Pakistan, exceeding other Muslim-majority countries.  Facebook traditionally complies, as not doing so would be to break Pakistan\u2019s laws, the source said, adding that authorities would often send dozens of links at a time and demand they be taken down.  \u2018ATTACKING ISLAM\u2019  In his letter, Khan also referred to the situation in France, where, he said, Islam was being associated with terrorism.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Khan said Macron had \u201cattacked Islam\u201d by encouraging the display of cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammad.  Khan\u2019s comments came after Macron paid tribute to a French history teacher beheaded by an Islamist radical who wanted to avenge the use of cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammad in a class on freedom of expression.  Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said the French ambassador in Islamabad had been summoned to be given a diplomatic protest against Macron\u2019s \u201cirresponsible remarks\u201d.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan also criticised Marcon, saying last week the French president needed mental help over his attitude towards Muslims. France then recalled its ambassador to Turkey.  Pakistan and Turkey share strong ties, while Khan and Erdogan have developed a close relationship - particularly on the topic of Islamophobia.  Khan\u2019s letter to Facebook and comments on Macron come as he faces pressure from a newly formed coalition of opposition parties seeking to oust him.  The cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad, first published in 2005 by Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, have long been a sensitive topic among Muslims, stirring protests in Pakistan and elsewhere.  Tens of thousands of people protested in Pakistan last month when the cartoons were republished by the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo.  Khan\u2019s government has subjected a number of social media apps to intense scrutiny and banned some for content authorities deemed obscene or immoral.","1012":"NEW YORK, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The Dow hit a record closing high on Tuesday, but a drop in Facebook shares weighed on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.

Australia signed a separate open letter to Facebook.)  WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The United States and the United Kingdom are seizing on Facebook Inc\u2019s plan to apply end-to-end encryption across its messaging services to press for major changes to a practice long opposed by law enforcement, saying it hinders the fight against child abuse and terrorism.  The two countries plan to sign a special data agreement on Thursday that would fast track requests from law enforcement to technology companies for information about the communications of terrorists and child predators, according to documents reviewed by Reuters.  Law enforcement could get information in weeks or even days instead of the current wait of six months to two years, one document said.  The agreement will be announced alongside an open letter to Facebook and its Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, also signed by Australia, calling on the company to suspend plans related to developing end-to-end encryption technology across its messaging services.  The latest tug-of-war between governments and tech companies over user data could also impact Apple Inc, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Microsoft Corp, as well as smaller encrypted chat apps like Signal.  Washington has called for more regulation and launched anti-trust investigations against many tech companies, criticizing them over privacy lapses, election-related activity and dominance in online advertising.  Child predators have increasingly used messaging applications, including Facebook\u2019s Messenger, in the digital age to groom their victims and exchange explicit images and videos. The number of known child sexual abuse images has soared from thousands to tens of millions in just the past few years.  Speaking at an event in Washington on Wednesday, Associate Attorney General Sujit Raman said the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children received more than 18 million tips of online child sex abuse last year, over 90% of them from Facebook.  He estimated that up to 75% of those tips would \u201cgo dark\u201d if social media companies like Facebook were to go through with encryption plans.  Facebook said in a statement that it strongly opposes \u201cgovernment efforts to build backdoors,\u201d which it said would undermine privacy and security.  Antigone Davis, Facebook\u2019s global head of safety, told Reuters the company was looking at ways to prevent inappropriate behavior and stop predators from connecting with children.  This approach \u201coffers us an opportunity to prevent harms in a way that simply going after content doesn\u2019t,\u201d she said.  In practice, the bilateral agreement would empower the UK government to directly request data from U.S. tech companies, which remotely store data relevant to their own ongoing criminal investigations, rather than asking for it via U.S. law enforcement officials.  The effort represents a two-pronged approach by the United States and its allies to pressure private technology companies while making information sharing about criminal investigations faster.  A representative for the U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment.  Susan Landau, a professor of cybersecurity and policy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, said disputes over encryption have flared on-and-off since the mid-1990s.  She said government officials concerned with fighting child abuse would be better served by making sure investigators had more funding and training.  \u201cThey seem to ignore the low-hanging fruit in favor of going after the thing they\u2019ve been going after for the past 25 years,\u201d she said.  The letter addressed to Zuckerberg and Facebook comes from U.S. Attorney General William Barr, UK Secretary of State for the Home Department Priti Patel and Australian Minister of Home Affairs Peter Dutton.  \u201cOur understanding is that much of this activity, which is critical to protecting children and fighting terrorism, will no longer be possible if Facebook implements its proposals as planned,\u201d the letter reads.  \u201cUnfortunately, Facebook has not committed to address our serious concerns about the impact its proposals could have on protecting our most vulnerable citizens.\u201d  WhatsApp's global head Will Cathcart wrote in a public internet forum here on Saturday that the company \"will always oppose government attempts to build backdoors because they would weaken the security of everyone who uses WhatsApp including governments themselves.\"  That app, which is already encrypted, is also owned by Facebook.","1018":"A proposed class of Facebook Inc users is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to reject the company\u2019s petition to review a federal appeals court ruling that revived litigation over alleged improper tracking of logged-out users\u2019 internet browsing.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  The study by U.S. based think tank the Technology Policy Institute (TPI) is the first that attempts to quantify the value of online privacy and data. It assessed how much privacy is worth in six countries by looking at the habits of people in the United States, Germany, Mexico, Brazil, Columbia and Argentina.  It addresses growing concern about how companies from technology platforms to retailers have been collecting and monetizing personal data. U.S. regulators have imposed hefty fines on Facebook Inc and Alphabet-owned Google\u2019s YouTube unit for privacy violations.  \u201cDifferences in how much people value privacy of different data types across countries suggests that people in some places may prefer weaker rules while people in other places might prefer stronger rules,\u201d Scott Wallsten, president and senior fellow at TPI told Reuters.  \u201cQuantifying the value of privacy is necessary for conducting any analysis of proposed privacy policies,\u201d he said.  The study found Germans want to be paid more for letting technology platforms share their personal data with third-parties followed by U.S. consumers.  People across the board place the highest value on financial information such as bank balance and biometric information such as fingerprint data in particular, and consider location data the least valuable, the study found.  A technology platform, on average, across all people the study assessed, would have to pay consumers a monthly $8.44 to share their bank balance information, $7.56 to share fingerprint information, $6.05 to read an individual\u2019s texts, and $5.80 to share information on cash withdrawals.  By contrast, people wanted to be paid only $1.82 per month to share location data and nothing to be sent advertisements via text messages.  The study found Latin American consumers have a preference for seeing advertisements on their smartphone, in contrast to U.S. residents and Germans.

The first rulings will be scrutinized to see how independent the board appears from the world\u2019s largest social media platform and how it may rule in the future, particularly ahead of its high-profile decision on whether Facebook was right to suspend former U.S. President Donald Trump.  Facebook blocked Trump\u2019s access to his Facebook and Instagram accounts over concerns of further violent unrest following the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol by the former president\u2019s supporters. The board said the Trump case would be opened for public comment on Friday and that he had not yet provided a statement to the board.  Facebook said it would abide by the board\u2019s decisions. The group, which was created by Facebook in response to criticism of the way it treats problematic content, also called for the company to be clearer about its rules on what is allowed on its platforms.  Here is the full list of the board\u2019s rulings:  DECISIONS OVERTURNED:  * A post from a user in Myanmar with photos of a deceased child that included commentary on a perceived inconsistency between Muslims\u2019 reactions to killings in France and to China\u2019s treatment of Uighur Muslims.  * An alleged quote from Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels that Facebook removed for violating its policy on \u201cdangerous individuals and organizations.\u201d  * A post in a group claiming certain drugs could cure COVID-19, which criticized the French government\u2019s response to the pandemic. This case was submitted by Facebook, rather than a user.  * Instagram photos showing female nipples that the user in Brazil said aimed to raise awareness of breast cancer symptoms. Facebook had also said this removal was an error and restored the post.  DECISION UPHELD:  * A post that purported to show historical photos of churches in Baku, Azerbaijan, with a caption that Facebook said indicated \u201cdisdain\u201d for Azerbaijani people and support for Armenia.  See a factbox on the decisions.  Facebook now has seven days to restore the pieces of content that the board ruled should not have been taken down. The board said it would shortly announce one more decision from its first batch, as well as the next round of cases.  The board also issued nine nonbinding policy recommendations - for example that Facebook should tell users the specific rule they have violated and better define their rules on issues like dangerous groups and health misinformation. Facebook doesn\u2019t have to act on these, but it does have to publicly respond within 30 days.  \u201cWe can see that there are some policy problems at Facebook,\u201d said board member Katherine Chen in an interview. \u201cWe want their policy to be clear - especially those policies involved in human rights and freedom of speech. They have to be precise, accessible, clearly defined,\u201d she added.  In a blog post responding to the decisions, Facebook said it would publish updated COVID-19 misinformation policies. However, it said it would not change its approach to removing misinformation during the global pandemic.

The Reuters\/Ipsos poll adds to other indications that Facebook has so far suffered no ill effects from the episode, other than a public relations headache.  The national online poll, conducted April 26-30, found that about half of Facebook\u2019s American users said they had not recently changed the amount that they used the site, and another quarter said they were using it more.  The remaining quarter said that they were using it less recently, had stopped using it or deleted their account.  That means that the people using Facebook less were roughly balanced by those using it more, with no clear net loss or gain in use.  Among all adults, 64 percent said they use Facebook at least once a day, down slightly from 68 percent who said so in a similar poll in late March, shortly after news organizations reported Cambridge Analytica\u2019s activity.

Its executives have apologized for the data-harvesting, pledged to investigate others who collected Facebook user data and reduced the amount of data available to similar app developers now.  The Cambridge Analytica scandal broke on March 16, sparking interest online in the hashtag #deletefacebook.  In its first quarter results, however, Facebook said the number of monthly users in the United States and Canada rose to 241 million on March 31 from 239 million on Dec. 31, growth that was roughly in line with recent years.  According to the poll, more Facebook users said they knew how to guard their personal information on the site than users of other social media platforms such as Snapchat, Instagram, Pinterest and Tumblr.  It found that 74 percent of Facebook users said they were aware of their current privacy settings, and 78 percent said they knew how to change them.  In comparison, 60 percent of Instagram users said they knew their current privacy settings and 65 percent said they knew how to change them. And 55 percent of Twitter users knew their privacy settings, and 58 percent knew how to use them.  Despite their understanding of Facebook\u2019s privacy settings, only 23 percent of its users said they have \u201ctotal control\u201d over the information they store on the platform.

Zuckerberg told Congress last month Facebook would take down content from politicians that could risk voter or census suppression. Sharpton said, however, he thought that a wide array of content from politicians could indirectly cause such suppression.  Ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November 2020, Facebook\u2019s policy has also been slammed by Democratic candidates and was recently criticized by some of its employees in an internal letter.  Twitter Inc's TWTR.N decision last week to ban all political advertising has also heightened scrutiny of its larger rival's stance.  Facebook said in a statement it was grateful that the civil rights leaders took the time to attend the dinner with Zuckerberg and Sandberg.  \u201cThey discussed a range of important issues and we look forward to continuing these conversations,\u201d the statement said.  Zuckerberg defended the policy in an earnings call last week, saying Facebook did not want to stifle political speech. He also estimated that ads from politicians would be less than 0.5% of revenue next year.  Sharpton, who had sent a letter to Zuckerberg requesting a meeting, said he would next ask for a meeting with Alphabet's GOOGL.O Google about its stance on the same issue. He said he also wanted to meet with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.  Critics of Facebook\u2019s policy have run intentionally false ads to highlight the issue.

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg repeated the company\u2019s warning that growing user interest in private messaging, video and safer content would cause costs to rise faster than revenue for \u201csome time.\u201d But he said he was focused on bringing them in line.  That same guidance three months ago sparked Facebook\u2019s biggest one-day sell-off as some investors braced for dire results. The third-quarter performance and revised guidance suggested that the downward trend would be more gradual and taper off after 2019, financial analysts said.  Shares of Facebook traded up about 3 percent after updating its forecast. They reversed course several times, falling and gaining as much as 5 percent, during an hour of volatility after closing on Tuesday up 2.9 percent at $146.22.  Facebook, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O had suffered a battering over the last month on Wall Street after leading a years-long rally. Slowing growth has been a top concern, and Facebook's weak results did not squash those fears.  \u201cThe best news was that the quarter was just not a disaster,\u201d Ivan Feinseth, analyst at Tigress Financial Partners, told Reuters.  The company estimated revenue growth would slow in the current quarter, compared with last quarter, which could mark the worst performance since its initial public offering in 2012.  The main Facebook service and its Messenger sibling grew monthly users to 2.27 billion, up 10 percent compared with a year ago but a percentage point below both expectations and last quarter\u2019s pace.  Zuckerberg said that Facebook\u2019s problem is that users are gravitating toward features such as direct messaging and video viewing faster than it can find ways to place ads there while attracting clicks and not annoying users.  FILE PHOTO: Figurines are seen in front of the Facebook logo in this illustration taken March 20, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  Adding to the challenge is that the bulk of new users are from countries including India, Indonesia and Philippines where advertisers focus more on TV, print and outdoor advertising, Facebook executives said.  Average revenue per U.S and Canadian user grew 6.7 percent in third quarter compared with the same period last year. Growth for Asian-Pacific users was 4.6 percent.  Though the factors are holding back ad prices, they also leave Facebook with significant untapped commercial opportunities with newer businesses such as WhatsApp. Still, Facebook said WhatsApp would not be a revenue driver in 2019.  A few financial analysts are concerned that the company\u2019s operational problems are so vast that revenue growth and cost containment will not come as expected.  The company disclosed its latest gaffe on Tuesday, saying that its misclassification of user activity had led to immaterial overcounting of monthly and daily users.  More broadly, the social network\u2019s reputation has suffered from a data breach affecting 29 million users in September and a privacy scandal involving a British political consulting firm in March.  It also has been rocked by domestic and international information warfare on its services, including WhatsApp and Instagram, and a wave of executive departures.  About 2.6 billion users interact with at least one of Facebook\u2019s services each month, up from 2.5 billion when it released the figure for the first time last quarter to emphasize that its potential audience for advertisers is unrivaled in size.  Facebook\u2019s spending has ballooned from licensing more engaging content such as video, and as it tries to fortify itself against fraudsters and hackers.  Zuckerberg said upcoming elections would be a test of its new systems, which he expects will be fully installed by end of 2019.  \u201cWith a community of more than 2 billion people, we will see all the good and bad that humanity can do. And we will never be perfect,\u201d he said.  Total expenses in the third quarter surged to nearly $8 billion, up 53 percent compared with a year ago. Operating margin, which Facebook has said should fall around 35 percent, dropped 2 percentage points from last quarter, to 42 percent.  The company estimated 2018 expenses would rise 50 percent to 55 percent above last year, trimming an earlier range of up to 60 percent. It forecasts expenses will grow 40 percent to 50 percent in 2019.  Overall third-quarter revenue was $13.7 billion, up 33 percent from the same period last year and in line with expectations when accounting for currency fluctuations.  Quarterly profit of $5.1 billion, or $1.76 per share, was up 9 percent and above the average per-share estimate of $1.48.

Facebook has been focusing on Instagram, its fastest-growing revenue generator, as the social networking website\u2019s core platform has come under fire from regulators pushing to improve information safeguards for individual privacy, to combat addiction to social media, and to stop misinformation or fake news.  In October, Instagram appointed long-term insider Adam Mosseri as the head of the photo-sharing app following the high-profile exits of the photo-sharing app\u2019s co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger.  Rival Snap Inc owner of Snapchat, which faces stiff competition from Instagram has been redesigning the app to lure more users and advertisers.

If they can\u2019t strike a deal, a government-appointed arbitrator will decide the price.  \u201cThe code\u2019s arbitration model with bias criteria presents unmanageable financial and operational risk for Google,\u201d Mel Silva, managing director for Australia and New Zealand, told a senate committee.  \u201cIf this version of the code were to become law, it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia.\u201d  Australia announced the legislation last month after an investigation found Alphabet Inc-owned Google and social media giant Facebook held too much market power in the media industry, a situation it said posed a potential threat to a well-functioning democracy.  The United States government this week asked Australia to scrap the proposed laws, which have broad political support, and suggested Australia should pursue a voluntary code instead.  Google\u2019s threat to limit its services in Australia came just hours after the internet giant reached a content-payment deal with some French news publishers.

According to the complaint filed in San Francisco federal court, Facebook persists in its willingness to let financial services advertisers \u201ctarget\u201d prospective customers by age and gender, despite a recent overhaul covering other kinds of ads.  It said the Menlo Park, California-based social media company\u2019s conduct violates that state\u2019s civil rights law, exposing Facebook to billions of dollars in potential damages to users nationwide.  \u201cThe Internet is not a place where you can discriminate against people because of their age or gender, particularly in financial services opportunities,\u201d Peter Romer-Friedman, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an phone interview. \u201cIt would be like General Motors refusing to offer women or older people the same features on a car as men or younger people.\u201d  Facebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The complaint was filed seven months after Facebook agreed to overhaul its targeted ad system, including for Instagram and Messenger, to settle lawsuits by civil rights groups that it let employers, landlords and lenders discriminate by age, gender and zip code when placing job, housing and credit ads.  Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said at the time the changes would help protect Facebook users, and that \u201cgetting this right was deeply important to me and all of us at Facebook because inclusivity is a core value for our company.\u201d  While Facebook has begun implementing the changes, the complaint said it still allows financial services ads limiting such services to \u201cpeople ages 24 to 40,\u201d \u201cmen ages 20 and older,\u201d and other comparable groups.  Facebook is the world\u2019s second-largest seller of online ads, and on Wednesday said around 2.8 billion people use at least one of its platforms each month.  \u201cWe recognize that Facebook has taken significant steps to prevent discrimination in housing and jobs,\u201d as well as credit ads, said Romer-Friedman, a lawyer at Outten & Golden. \u201cThe company can do a lot more.\u201d  Thursday\u2019s complaint seeks damages for millions of Facebook users under California\u2019s Unruh Civil Rights Act, which allows $4,000 of damages per violation.

The world\u2019s biggest social network said in a blog post that it would remove content about the virus \u201cwith false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organizations and local health authorities,\u201d saying such content would violate its ban on misinformation leading to \u201cphysical harm.\u201d  The move is unusually aggressive for Facebook, which generally limits the distribution of content containing health misinformation through restrictions on search results and advertising, but allows the original posts to stay up.  That approach has angered critics who say the company has failed to curb the spread of inaccuracies that pose major global health threats.  In particular, misinformation about vaccination has spread far on social media in many countries in recent years, including during major vaccination campaigns to prevent polio in Pakistan and to immunize against yellow fever in South America.  Facebook, under fierce scrutiny worldwide in recent years over its privacy practices, has previously removed vaccine misinformation in Samoa, where a measles outbreak killed dozens late last year, after determining the situation was so severe that the inaccuracies were risks to physical harm, a spokeswoman told Reuters, calling the move an \u201cextreme action.\u201d  It also removed misinformation about polio vaccines in Pakistan, although the imminent harm in that case involved risks of violence against the health workers carrying out the immunization campaigns, she said.","1031":"FILE PHOTO: Facebook logos are seen on a screen in this picture illustration taken December 2, 2019.

The Canadian federal agency charged with protecting privacy rights of individuals said on Thursday that the agency, along with its counterpart in British Columbia, would jointly investigate Facebook and AggregateIQ over the ongoing data scandal.  British Columbia\u2019s privacy commissioner was separately investigating AggregateIQ over whether the Victoria-based company had broken provincial personal privacy rules for its role in the Brexit campaign.

At a Senate inquiry into the planned law this month, local heads of both companies outlined their opposition to the plans, which would be among the toughest in the world in dealing with the financial impact of global internet companies on domestic media, which have been hit by shrinking advertising revenue.  \u201cWe\u2019re told that if we go ahead with this, we\u2019re going to break the internet,\u201d Frydenberg said on the ABC.  \u201cWhat I do know is that media businesses should be paid for content.\u201d","1034":"March 19 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc\u2019s shares fell 4 percent in premarket on Monday after media reports that a political consultancy that worked on President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign gained inappropriate access to data on 50 million Facebook users.  The move would knock $21.5 billion off the social network\u2019s market value of $538 billion as of Friday\u2019s close. One Wall Street analyst said the reports raised \u2018systemic problems\u2019 with Facebook\u2019s business model and a number said it could spur far deeper regulatory scrutiny of the platform.  The head of European Parliament said on Monday that EU lawmakers will investigate whether the data misuse has taken place, adding the allegation is an unacceptable violation of citizens\u2019 privacy rights.  Facebook was already facing new calls for regulation from U.S. Congress and questions about personal data safeguards after the reports from the New York Times and London\u2019s Observer over the weekend.  The papers reported on Saturday that private information from more than 50 million Facebook users improperly ended up in the hands of data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, and that the information had not been deleted despite Facebook demands dating back to 2015.  \u201cWe think this episode is another indication of systemic problems at Facebook,\u201d said Brian Wieser, analyst at New York-based brokerage Pivotal Research Group, which already has a \u201csell\u201d rating on a stock that rose 60 percent last year.  Wieser argued that regulatory risks for the company would intensify and enhanced use of data in advertising would be at greater risk than before.  He added, however, that it was unlikely to have a meaningful impact on the company\u2019s business for now, with advertisers unlikely to \u201csuddenly change the trajectory of their spending growth on the platform\u201d.  The losses would be Facebook\u2019s biggest daily fall since a broader market pullback in February.

(Reuters) - Facebook Inc debuted an overhaul of its core social network on Tuesday, taking its first concrete steps to refashion itself into a private messaging and e-commerce company as it tries to move past scandals while tapping new revenue sources.  Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg unveiled a fresh design for the world\u2019s biggest social network that de-emphasized its News Feed. It also ditched the signature blue banner that has been on the app since its launch.  The new design showcases Facebook\u2019s messaging app, online marketplace and video-on-demand site, while giving greater prominence to the popular photo-driven Stories feature.  The company also rolled out features aimed at encouraging users to interact with their close social circle as well as with businesses, such as a \u201cSecret Crush\u201d option for Facebook Dating and a tool for appointment booking.  \u201cAs the world gets bigger and more connected, we need that sense of intimacy more than ever. That\u2019s why I believe that the future is private. This is the next chapter for our services,\u201d said Zuckerberg, speaking at Facebook\u2019s annual F8 conference, where the company gives developers a peek at product releases.  Investors greeted the announcements, mostly launching lower-margin businesses, with a lukewarm response. Facebook shares ended down 0.7 percent on Tuesday.  Zuckerberg in March promised changes to the advertising-driven social media company, which has come under regulatory scrutiny over propaganda on its platform and violations of users\u2019 data privacy.  He identified private messaging, short-lasting stories and small groups as the fastest-growing areas of online communication. In the last three years, the number of people using Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp has almost doubled.  Building up those more intimate and encrypted forms of communication could also reduce pressure on Facebook to clean up misinformation and abusive content. In the wake of its scandals, the company has spent heavily on tools to catch banned material.  The social media company is now working on \u201cLightSpeed\u201d in order to make its Messenger app smaller and faster.  Facebook will also introduce a desktop version of Messenger for Mac and Windows and launch a feature called \u201cProduct Catalog\u201d for WhatsApp Business. The desktop app will be available this fall.  Later this week, Facebook will run a test in Canada for a major change to its Instagram app that would remove the number of likes on photos as well as video views from users\u2019 feeds, permalink pages and profiles.  Facebook had delayed rolling out certain products at last year\u2019s F8 event, which came soon after revelations it inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million users with British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.  Slideshow ( 16 images )  \u201cI know that we don\u2019t exactly have the strongest reputation on privacy right now, to put it lightly,\u201d Zuckerberg said.  Other Facebook executives introduced changes within the Messenger and Instagram apps aimed at helping businesses connect with customers, including appointment booking and a tool to lure customers into direct conversations with companies via ads.  The online ad market is largely dominated by Facebook and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google. But the field is more diverse for messaging, e-commerce and payments, with big players like Amazon.com Inc , Microsoft Corp and eBay Inc as well as fast-growing Silicon Valley unicorns like workplace messaging app Slack and video conferencing service Zoom Video Communications Inc.  Slideshow ( 16 images )  \u201cWe\u2019ve shown time and again as a company that we have what it takes to evolve,\u201d Zuckerberg said.  MAKING MONEY  The shift also comes as Facebook is looking beyond advertising for future income.  Facebook pulled in nearly $56 billion in revenue last year, almost of all which came from showing ads to the 2.7 billion people who access its family of apps each month.  But the company is no longer adding many new users in the United States and Europe, its most lucrative markets, and it must find additional sources of revenue if it is to sustain growth.  The product releases at F8 indicated that its answer involves efforts to keep users on its apps for longer, coupled with e-commerce tools Facebook is hoping businesses will pay to use.  Features that drive the most user engagement, like Stories and videos, are being decked out with new tools and given increased prominence across the platforms.  One new feature will allow users to watch videos together in Messenger, while also viewing each other\u2019s reactions in simultaneous texts and video chats.  Facebook Dating will be expanded into 14 new markets, including places in where Facebook has high user growth. The \u201cSecret Crush\u201d feature will allows users to explore potential romantic relationships within their friend circle.  New shopping and other business-to-consumer interactions, already popular in Chinese social apps like WeChat, could also help squeeze revenue out of Facebook\u2019s messaging services.  Instagram is expanding a sales system introduced last month, allowing public figures, known as influencers, to tag products in their posts so fans can buy them right away.  Sellers on Marketplace will likewise be able to receive payments and arrange shipping directly within Facebook, while users of WhatsApp and Messenger will be able to send money to each other as easily as sharing a photo, Zuckerberg said.","1036":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Instacart said on Tuesday it hired Bangaly Kaba as vice president of growth from Facebook Inc\u2019s Instagram as the grocery delivery startup tries to make itself a household name.

The spokeswoman, Nora Chan, said the board has authority to appoint directors between annual meetings.  \u201cSince this appointment is effective after this year\u2019s annual meeting, it is not on the ballot this year. It would be on the ballot at future annual meetings,\u201d Chan said via e-mail.  Exactly when Zients should be voted in is something of an academic question since Facebook\u2019s structure gives Zuckerberg a majority of its voting power.  Still Facebook has been at pains to address its issues in order to reassure investors. Its share price fell during the first three months of the year as details of its data-protection problems emerged. The shares have since recovered, but a number of funds that call themselves socially responsible are selling the stock, concerned Facebook has not fully addressed its issues.  Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services on May 16 recommended investors withhold support from five of eight directors on the company\u2019s ballot including Zuckerberg, and vote in favor of shareholder proposals aimed at improving its response to problems like election interference and harassment.  In recommending that investors withhold support from Zuckerberg, ISS cited the lack of a formal board-nominating committee, a concern it has raised in past years.  ISS Special Counsel Patrick McGurn said the lack of a vote on Zients is \u201csuboptimal.\u201d  \u201cBest governance practice generally dictates that a board should provide shareholders with a timely opportunity, typically at the next scheduled meeting, to elect a director who is appointed by the existing board members to fill a vacancy,\u201d he said.  However, McGurn said the timing may not have been entirely in Facebook\u2019s control, given that departing director Jan Koum did not immediately leave the company\u2019s board at the same time he quit as a company executive.  James McRitchie, a private investor who filed one of two pending shareholder resolutions calling on Facebook to revamp its voting rules, said the lack of a vote on Zients will not look good at a time when the company needs to seem responsive and not be seen as \u201ccutting out shareholders.\u201d","1040":"Facebook Inc has agreed to pay $52 million to resolve a proposed class action accusing it of failing to protect content moderators from psychological and other injuries that can result from their exposure to graphic and violent imagery.

Facebook shares fell 0.4 percent to close at $193.28 even as Wall Street\u2019s stock indexes rose for the day. Both Democrats and Republicans raised concerns about the report.  The software referred to by the New York Times was launched 10 years ago and used by about 60 companies, including Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Apple Inc, Blackberry Ltd BB.TO, HTC Corp 2498.TW, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS, Facebook's vice president of product partnerships Ime Archibong wrote in a blog post.  The Times said Facebook allowed companies access to the data of users\u2019 friends without their explicit consent, even after declaring that it would no longer share such information with outsiders.  The Times report said: \u201cSome device makers could retrieve personal information even from users\u2019 friends who believed they had barred any sharing.\u201d Facebook denied that device makers could retrieve personal information from users\u2019 friends if they had barred such sharing.  Archibong said the data was only shared with device makers for the purposes of improving Facebook users\u2019 access to the information. \u201cThese partners signed agreements that prevented people\u2019s Facebook information from being used for any other purpose than to recreate Facebook-like experiences.\u201dRegulators and authorities in several countries have increased scrutiny of Facebook after it failed to protect the data of some 87 million users that was shared with now-defunct political data firm Cambridge Analytica.  Two Democrats on the Senate Commerce Committee, Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal, responded to the Times report by writing Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg.  \u201cNew revelations that Facebook provided access to users\u2019 personal information, including religion, political preferences, and relationship status, to dozens of mobile device manufacturers without users\u2019 explicit consent are deeply concerning,\u201d they said in a letter.  Facebook said in a statement the company looks \u201cforward to addressing any questions the Commerce Committee may have.\u201d  Elena Hernandez, a spokeswoman for House Energy and Commerce committee Chairman Greg Walden, a Republican, called the report \u201ca troubling reminder that the expectations tech companies set for consumer protection sometimes differ from what is actually delivered.\u201d  Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat, said in a tweet late Sunday it \u201csure looks like Zuckerberg lied to Congress about whether users have \u2018complete control\u2019 over who sees our data on Facebook.

While it is near certain that the Fed will raise rates by a quarter basis point on Wednesday, investors are more focused on whether policymakers think economic conditions are strong enough for four hikes this year, one more than the markets expect.  Shares of Facebook fell about 4 percent in premarket trading in the wake of reports that the personal data of 50 million users were misused by a political consultant, prompting a review by the company and expressions of concern by several U.S. lawmakers.  \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s expecting any surprises (from the Fed) ... but the bigger factor has been the surrounding the big technology companies, particularly Facebook,\u201d said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.  \u201cJust a re-examination of whether or not there are issues out there for all of the tech companies, regulatory or otherwise. They\u2019ve been such leaders that it\u2019s spilling over into in the general markets.\u201d  Technology stocks have powered the stock market\u2019s rally over the past year and have been the best performing among the 11 S&P sectors.  By 8:25 a.m. ET, Nasdaq 100 e-minis declined 76.5 points. Dow e-minis were down 110 points and S&P 500 e-minis fell 12 points.  Concerns about faster rate hikes were at the heart of the stock market\u2019s sell off in early February. While the market has pulled back since, healthy economic data has done little to ease jitters of a fourth rate hike this year.  The Fed will raise rates this week, all 104 economists polled by Reuters during March 5-13 said, with three more hikes to follow this year, driven by a solid labor market underpinning optimism.  That is more than the three hikes, including one in March, that economists had expected, according to an earlier poll.  \u201cI don\u2019t think investors are particularly fixated on whether it\u2019s three or four. The direction seems pretty clear and there will be higher rates,\u201d said Meckler.  Apple slipped half a percent after brokerage Nomura Instinet said its checks showed there was little improvement in demand for iPhones this year and lowered estimate for the smartphone\u2019s sales.  The main U.S. indexes posted losses last week due to fears that President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff plans would spark retaliation from its trading partners, especially China, and on political uncertainties after high-profile White House exits.  The tariff issues are likely to dominate a gathering of finance leaders at a two-day meeting of the Group of 20 finance ministers this week.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Mark Zuckerberg has handed users one more reason to quit Facebook. Newspaper reports that a UK political consultancy used millions of user profiles creates fresh risks at the social network he founded. People are already spending less time on Facebook. The danger is that members may unfriend it altogether.  Facebook lost more than $35 billion of its value on Monday after reports said that more than 50 million people had their personal data misappropriated by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. The firm used the Facebook trove, obtained without authorization, to build a software program to influence voters, including in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to the New York Times and Observer of London.  Multiple investigations have been opened in the United States and Europe as a result - just as Facebook scrambles to address earlier challenges involving fake-news and ad-measurement mishaps. The controversy hasn\u2019t yet shaken the confidence of Madison Avenue, which is still shoveling money to Facebook. Revenue rose 47 percent last year to $41 billion.  The debacles may be taking a toll in other ways though. Zuckerberg said at his last quarterly earnings presentation that the aggregate time users spent on the social network was falling by 50 million hours every day. Advertisers often turn to how long people hang around as a sign of engagement.  And although the number of daily active users in the fourth quarter rose 14 percent year-over-year, to 1.4 billion globally, cracks are starting to appear in key markets. In the United States and Canada, members dipped by 1 million in the fourth quarter from the preceding three months, to 184 million, while in Europe member growth has slowed significantly. Those regions generated nearly 75 percent of the company\u2019s fourth-quarter revenue.  Like MySpace before it, Facebook\u2019s long-term dominance is by no means assured. New research from eMarketer estimates that Facebook\u2019s share of the U.S. digital-ad market will slip slightly over the next two years as user growth slows and pricing for ads reaches its limits. The onslaught of privacy concerns - and the risk that it drives away users - may accelerate that decline.","1045":"A picture illustration shows a Facebook logo reflected in a person's eye, in Zenica, March 13, 2015.

It will introduce targeted changes to some participants\u2019 experiences, such as advertising or types of posts shown to them.  Facebook employees will supply aggregated data to the external academics to protect the privacy of those users.

He had been a strong advocate for an aggressive approach to alleged Russian activity on the platform aimed at manipulating elections. His departure was first reported by the New York Times.

London-based Cambridge Analytica said it strongly denied the media claims, and that it deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party application in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.  However, further allegations about the firm\u2019s tactics were reported late Monday by British broadcaster Channel 4 which said it secretly taped interviews with senior Cambridge Analytica executives in which they boasted of their ability to sway elections in countries around the world with digital manipulation and traditional political trickery.

Facebook and other social media companies including Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s YouTube have taken voluntary steps to restrict possible foreign interference and combat false news, but they have not been forced by law or regulation to make changes and legislation on the issue has stalled.

The measure has already passed the House and is expected to soon become law.  Facebook said on Friday it had learned in 2015 that a Cambridge University psychology professor lied to the company and violated its policies by passing data to Cambridge Analytica from a psychology testing application he had built.  Facebook said it suspended the firms and researchers involved and said the data had been misused but not stolen, because users gave permission.

Fernando Haddad, presidential candidate of Brazil's leftist Workers' Party (PT), attends a rally in downtown of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil October 19, 2018. REUTERS\/Ricardo Moraes  On Thursday, newspaper Folha de S.Paulo had reported that supporters of the far-right candidate had funded mass messaging attacks against leftist rival Fernando Haddad.  Bolsonaro said in an online video that he had no knowledge of such activity and called on any supporters doing so to stop.  Haddad and his allies have urged an investigation and threatened a flurry of legal action, as the race that lawmaker Bolsonaro is expected to win by a landslide on Oct. 28 reaches its final stretch.  Later on Friday, Brazil\u2019s top electoral court TSE approved opening a probe into the case.  The recriminations highlight the outsized political role of WhatsApp in the election in Brazil, where its more than 120 million users rival the reach of Facebook\u2019s main platform, in a country with a population of almost 210 million.  The messaging app allows groups of hundreds of users to exchange encrypted texts, photos and video out of the view of authorities or independent fact checkers, enabling the rapid spread of misinformation with no way to track its source or full reach. Digital marketing firms had apparently taken advantage of that opacity to circulate unregistered political propaganda, according to the Folha report.  WhatsApp said on Friday it was \u201ctaking immediate legal action to stop companies from sending bulk messages,\u201d including cease and desist letters to the companies in question.  The day before, WhatsApp said it had banned hundreds of thousands of accounts during the election period, with spam detection technology spotting accounts engaged in automated \u2018bot\u2019 behavior.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Yet new questions arose on Friday about the effectiveness and consequences of that technology.  The leading presidential candidate\u2019s son, Senator-elect Flavio Bolsonaro, revealed he had been blocked from using the service, demanding an explanation from the company.  \u201cThere is no limit to the persecution!\u201d Flavio Bolsonaro wrote on Twitter, adding that the ban had since been lifted.  WhatsApp confirmed that it had blocked Flavio Bolsonaro\u2019s account for \u201cspam behavior\u201d in recent days, for reasons unrelated to the Folha report.  OFFICIAL COMPLAINT  Haddad\u2019s Workers Party has filed an official complaint with electoral courts, asking them to investigate the allegations of illicit financing for misleading propaganda.  It is unclear what effect, if any, the accusations will have on opinion polls. The latest Datafolha survey, taken before the story was published, showed Bolsonaro had 59 percent of voter support, compared to 41 percent for Haddad.  Bolsonaro has run as an anti-establishment candidate despite representing Rio de Janeiro state as a federal congressman for nearly three decades. With a career untainted by major corruption investigations, he has rallied voters fed up with years of graft scandals and economic mismanagement while the Workers Party was in power.  The WhatsApp allegations have energized Haddad, who said his party has witnesses saying Bolsonaro asked business leaders for cash to pay for the bulk messaging, which he described as soliciting undeclared campaign contributions.  The Democratic Labor Party (PDT), which supports Haddad, filed an electoral complaint on Friday asking courts to annul the presidential election due to what it called an \u201cabuse of economic power.\u201d","1056":"FILE PHOTO: A 3D printed Facebook logo is placed on broken glass above a printed EU flag in this illustration taken January 28, 2019.

Antitrust experts and congressional aides said the 449-page report from the antitrust panel of the House Judiciary Committee, released on Tuesday, lays out a road map for the Democratic Party to put the brakes on the dominance of Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc.  With the Nov. 3 election approaching fast and a new Congress scheduled to be sworn in in January, action on the report\u2019s recommendations this year is unlikely and no new legislative changes are imminent. However, the findings boost the chances for new laws in the future and will inform existing investigations against large technology companies by state attorneys general and agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission.  The report reflects the views of Democrats on the antitrust subcommittee in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. Republicans on the panel released two separate reports on the investigation.  U.S. Representative David Cicilline, chairman of the House antitrust panel, told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday he thinks a Biden administration would be receptive to the report. \u201cHe (Biden) has talked about how Big Tech platforms abuse their power,\u201d said Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat. \u201cHe recognizes that this sort of economic concentration undermines democracy.\u201d  Sarah Miller, executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, a Washington-based group focused on monopoly power, said the report \u201clays out the Democratic Party\u2019s position on tech platforms and how antitrust laws need to be refined and strengthened.\u201d  \u201cThe report has done a lot of work to set up where and why a Biden administration should act and how it should prioritize the recommendations in the report,\u201d she added. Miller is one of hundreds of members of the Biden campaign\u2019s tech policy committee.  William Kovacic, a former chair of the Federal Trade Commission, warned that the companies will \u201cpull out all the stops\u201d in lobbying against the changes.  Earlier this month, Reuters reported how large tech companies including Amazon were cozying up to the Biden campaign with cash and connections.  Biden has previously said antitrust enforcement has not been strong and that tech firms deserve a hard look from the federal agencies that oversee competition. He has stayed away from calling for the breakup of large technology companies, saying it would be premature to do so without a formal investigation.  The House report on Tuesday broadly recommended that companies should not both control and compete in related businesses, but stopped short of naming a specific company. Anti-monopoly experts and congressional aides said the report, which details Big Tech\u2019s abuses, has the potential to influence the thinking of Biden on the issue.  A spokesman for the Biden campaign did not immediately comment.  The antitrust panel will take up the majority report after the October recess for formal adoption and will have a vote on it, counsels for the committee said. The next step will be coming up with legislation to put the report\u2019s recommendations into action.  House panel chairman Cicilline also said in the interview he expects legislation tackling Big Tech\u2019s market power to be introduced in the current Congress and more bills to be introduced next year.","1063":"AMSTERDAM, Nov 11 (Reuters) - A Dutch court has ordered Facebook to remove advertisements that misuse the likeness of a local celebrity to promote fraudulent Bitcoin-related investments.

FILE PHOTO: German Finance Minister and Vice-Chancellor Olaf Scholz attends a news conference on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Berlin, Germany, April 8, 2020. REUTERS\/Michele Tantussi  The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is developing rules to make digital companies pay tax where they do business, rather than where they register subsidiaries. This could boost national tax revenues by a total of $100 billion a year, the OECD estimates.  But the coronavirus crisis and forecasts of a deep recession in many industrialised nations have cast doubt on the OECD\u2019s goal of reaching a deal among more than 130 countries this year.  Scholz, speaking at a political conference in Berlin, said the pandemic had underlined the urgency of improving international cooperation and boosting the capability of the public sector.  \u201cWe must work to ensure fiscal firepower and robust national budgets, in all countries. We must not allow some to avoid contributing their fair share,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cWe must put an end to the harmful race to the bottom on corporate tax rates.\u201d  Only small countries could hope to gain by undercutting the tax rates of their neighbours, Scholz added.  The OECD wants to set a minimum effective level at which companies would be taxed and is seeking agreement by the start of July, with an endorsement by the Group of 20 (G20) biggest economies by the end of the year.  TAX EVASION  A deal would not only strengthen national budgets and limit unfair tax evasion, but also help businesses by eliminating legal uncertainty and the threat of double taxation in different countries, Scholz said.  \u201cAn agreement will prevent an escalation of trade conflicts that unilateral steps would cause,\u201d Scholz said - a reference to French plans to push ahead with a national digital tax if no broader deal is reached by the end of this year.  \u201cAnd an agreement will support the long-term economic recovery across the globe after corona.\u201d  Germany had originally planned to host a big OECD conference in Berlin in early July with the aim of sealing a tax deal.  A finance ministry spokesman said the topic was still at the very top of the international agenda, but that Berlin was considering whether the conference needed to be postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic.  A German official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was a risk that the tax reform plan could now be put on the back burner because nobody could tell now how the world economy would look after the virus.  \u201cAgainst this backdrop, it\u2019s really difficult to agree on new tax rules just like that,\u201d the official said.

In April, Facebook allowed users in the United States and Canada to transfer photos and videos to Aphabet-owned Google Photos GOOGL.O for the first time - a move that is likely to help the company respond to U.S. regulators and lawmakers, who are investigating its competitive practices and allegations it has stifled competition.  \u201cThe FTC often issues reports following these workshops ... I think their recommendations should include dedicated portability legislation,\u201d Bijan Madhani, privacy and public policy manager at Facebook told Reuters.  Facebook said a portability bill called the Access Act, already doing the rounds in Congress from Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal and Mark Warner and Republican senator Josh Hawley, is a good first step. It would require large tech platforms to let their users easily move their data to other services.  Facebook has engaged with the lawmakers on it and will continue working with them, Madhani added.  He said Facebook is seeking regulatory guidance, in the form of an independent body or regulator, in answering policy questions and helping them address liability issues tied to portability.  The social media platform is also pressing for more clarity on what kinds of data should be portable and who is responsible for protecting such information as it moves to different services, he added.  In April, the company said it eventually hopes to allow users to move key data such as their contacts and friend lists onto another platform in a way that protects user privacy.  Data portability is a requirement under Europe\u2019s privacy law called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California\u2019s privacy law called the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).

Sweden and its Nordic neighbors, with cheap electricity and low temperatures, are attractive for data centers, with many Silicon valley giants and cryptocurrency miners rushing to move in.  Facebook will add a third building to the existing two at the Lulea data center, which Vattenfall supplies electricity to.  \u201cThis third building will measure nearly 50,000 square meters, and we anticipate will start serving traffic in early 2021,\u201d Facebook said in a statement.

Lulea\u2019s mayor Niklas Nordstrom said the new building would double the size of the data center to more than 100,000 square meters (1.1 million square feet) and double its capacity of operations.  The current two-building campus consumes more than one percent of Sweden\u2019s total power production and that will also double, he told Reuters.  The expansion will create about 100 new Facebook jobs at the center, which currently employs fewer than 200 people, while its construction will create about 1,000 temporary jobs, Nordstrom said.  In 2017, Sweden cut its tax rate on electricity for data centers by 97 percent, to the same level as other heavy industries such as steelworks and car plants, making it attractive for new investments, said Node Pole.  \u201cSweden now has the lowest energy cost in the EU, with the lowest carbon footprint,\u201d it said, explaining Facebook\u2019s move.

Facebook has been hit by a number of privacy-related issues recently, including a glitch that exposed passwords of millions of users stored in readable format within its internal systems to its employees.  Last year, the company came under fire following revelations that Cambridge Analytica, a British political consulting firm, obtained personal data of millions of people\u2019s Facebook profiles without their consent.  The company has also been facing criticism from lawmakers across the world for what has been seen by some as tricking people into giving personal data to Facebook and for the presence of hate speech and data portability on the platform.  Separately, Facebook was asked to ensure its social media platform is not abused for political purposes or to spread misinformation during elections.","1073":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook Inc said on Monday it would not proceed with the launch of its Libra cryptocurrency until regulatory concerns are addressed, as the U.S. Treasury secretary took the unusual step on of saying he had serious concerns it could be used for illicit activity.  David Marcus, who oversees Facebook\u2019s blockchain efforts, planned to tell Congress that Libra is not being built to compete with traditional currencies or interfere with monetary policy.  \u201cThe Libra Association, which will manage the (Libra) Reserve, has no intention of competing with any sovereign currencies or entering the monetary policy arena,\u201d Marcus was due to say on Tuesday, according to prepared testimony released by the Senate Banking Committee. \u201cMonetary policy is properly the province of central banks.\u201d  \u201cFacebook will not offer the Libra digital currency until we have fully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals,\u201d he said.  Speaking with reporters, Mnuchin said he was not comfortable with Libra currently, particularly in guarding against money laundering and other illicit use.  \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to convince us of very high standards before they have access to the U.S. financial system,\u201d he said.  Mnuchin is the latest senior U.S. regulator to air concerns with the product, days after Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell expressed similar worries about the digital currency could be misused.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  \u201cThese cryptocurrencies have been dominated by illicit activity and speculation,\u201d said Mnuchin.  In his prepared testimony, Marcus said the Libra Association, the companies behind the Facebook-led cryptocurrency, planned to register as a money services business with the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and fully expected to comply with anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act rules.  Since announcing the Libra project last month, Facebook has faced a torrent of criticism and skepticism from policymakers across the world who cite concerns over data security, money laundering and consumer protections.  Marcus was scheduled to testify on Tuesday and Wednesday before congressional committees overseeing financial issues and several members have suggested the product be barred.  Addressing some of those concerns, Marcus said in his prepared testimony that partners providing financial services with Libra will be required to comply with anti-money laundering rules. The Libra Association will not hold personal data of users beyond basic transaction information, and personal information provided to Calibra, the digital wallet Facebook is developing to hold Libra, will not be shared with the social media company and cannot be used for targeting ads.  Marcus added that he expected the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information commissioner to be Libra\u2019s privacy regulator because the Libra Association is headquartered in Geneva. The association is also in preliminary talks with the Swiss Financial Markets Supervisory Authority on \u201can appropriate regulatory framework.\u201d  While promising Libra will adhere to relevant laws and regulations, Marcus aimed to sell lawmakers on the product\u2019s merits as well, arguing the United States should not stifle such innovation.  \u201cI am proud that Facebook has initiated this effort here in the United States,\u201d his testimony said. \u201cI believe that if America does not lead innovation in the digital currency and payments area, others will. If we fail to act, we could soon see a digital currency controlled by others whose values are dramatically different.\u201d","1074":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department will open an antitrust investigation of Facebook Inc FB.O, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, marking the fourth recent antitrust probe of the social media company.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam\/File Photo  Facebook also faces probes by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), a group of state attorneys general led by New York and the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee.  Large tech companies, including Apple Inc AAPL.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, have increasingly been on the defensive in recent years over lapses such as privacy breaches and outsized market influence.  Facebook has faced extra scrutiny tied to how it allowed its platforms to be used during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  The company, which owns one-time rivals Instagram and WhatsApp and has 2.4 billion monthly users, recently paid a $5 billion settlement for sharing 87 million users\u2019 data with defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.  Facebook declined to comment on Wednesday.  Reuters and others reported in June the two federal agencies had divided up responsibility for the companies being investigated, with the Justice Department taking Google and Apple while the FTC looked at Facebook and Amazon.  The Justice Department later said it was opening a probe of online platforms. It did not specify which ones, but said it would consider concerns raised about \u201csearch, social media and some retail services online\u201d.  Neither agency has revealed the focus of investigations into Facebook, though the Wall Street Journal has reported that the FTC\u2019s probe is focused on the company\u2019s acquisitions.  The world\u2019s largest social network has purchased nearly 90 companies since 2003, showed data from S&P Global.  The Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief likewise told a tech conference in August that the government is looking at previously approved acquisitions as part of its broad review.  This led some industry observers to question whether the two federal investigations would overlap.  Lawmakers, in particular Sen. Mike Lee, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust panel, criticized the appearance of an overlap in a hearing last week.  The agencies generally have a practice of meeting to decide who will investigate which matter but the FTC cannot probe certain areas, for example price-fixing.  The probe into Facebook by the state attorneys general, announced earlier this month, is being led by New York and also includes Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and the District of Columbia.  New York Attorney General Letitia James said that investigation would look into whether Facebook\u2019s actions had endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers\u2019 choices or increased the price of advertising.","1075":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron will hold \"frank\" talks with Facebook Inc FB.O Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg on tax and data privacy in a week's time when he welcomes the bosses of leading tech firms to Paris in a drive to lure more investment.

FILE PHOTO: Representations of virtual currency are displayed in front of the Libra logo in this illustration picture, June 21, 2019. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  The central banks of Britain, the euro zone, Japan, Canada, Sweden and Switzerland on Tuesday announced a plan to share experiences to look at the case for issuing digital currencies, amid a growing debate over the future of money.  Hiromi Yamaoka, former head of the BOJ\u2019s division overseeing payment and settlement systems, said the decision was a sign of how Libra has triggered a global competition among central banks to make their currencies more appealing.  \u201cThe latest decision (by the six central banks) is not just about sharing information. It\u2019s also an effort to keep something like Libra in check,\u201d said Yamaoka who, during his stint at the BOJ, was directly in charge of negotiations on new technology.  \u201cSomething like Libra would make transactions costs much cheaper. Major central banks need to appeal that they, too, are making efforts to make settlement more efficient with better use of digital technology,\u201d he told Reuters.  Currently a board member at IT consulting firm Future Corp, Yamaoka oversaw the BOJ\u2019s research into digital currencies and retains close contact with global central bank policymakers.  Central banks across the world have quickened the pace at which they are looking at issuing their own digital currencies, also known as CBDCs. Facebook's FB.O push to launch its Libra cryptocurrency has added fuel to questions over whether nation states will continue to control money in the decades ahead.  Of the major central banks, China\u2019s has emerged as the frontrunner in the drive to create its own digitized money, though details of its project are still scarce.  The BOJ has undertaken a joint research project with the European Central Bank, but has said it has no plan to issue CBDCs in the near-term horizon.  Yamaoka said the creation of the joint study group could speed up moves by the central banks to use blockchain technology for large-scale, wholesale settlement.  But the hurdle for central banks issuing digital currencies for small, retail settlement remains \u201cvery high,\u201d as doing so would stifle private-sector competition, he said.  Yamaoka also countered the view, held by some academics, that central banks could deepen negative interest rates more easily by issuing digital currencies.  \u201cIn the world of central bankers, the idea of using CBDCs to enhance the effect of monetary policy seems to have subsided somewhat,\u201d he said.  \u201cThere are increasing doubts about the effect of negative interest rates as a policy tool,\u201d Yamaoka said. \u201cIf so, do you want to issue CBDCs for the sake of deploying a policy with questionable effects?\u201d  The more imminent factor driving central banks into studying CBDCs is the need to boost their currencies\u2019 convenience so they survive in an age of diversifying settlement means, he said.  That is why the Federal Reserve, which issues the world\u2019s most-used currency, isn\u2019t interested in CBDCs, Yamaoka said.  \u201cIf you want to make monetary policy effective, you need to ensure people keep using the currency you issue.\u201d","1079":"MENLO PARK, Calif. (Reuters) - Facebook Inc FB.O on Tuesday released a rule book for the types of posts it allows on its social network, giving far more detail than ever before on what is permitted on subjects ranging from drug use and sex work to bullying, hate speech and inciting violence.  Facebook for years has had \u201ccommunity standards\u201d for what people can post. But only a relatively brief and general version was publicly available, while it had a far more detailed internal document to decide when individual posts or accounts should be removed.  Now, the company is providing the longer document on its website to clear up confusion and be more open about its operations, said Monika Bickert, Facebook\u2019s vice president of product policy and counter-terrorism.  \u201cYou should, when you come to Facebook, understand where we draw these lines and what\u2019s OK and what\u2019s not OK,\u201d Bickert told reporters in a briefing at Facebook\u2019s headquarters.  Facebook has faced fierce criticism from governments and rights groups in many countries for failing to do enough to stem hate speech and prevent the service from being used to promote terrorism, stir sectarian violence and broadcast acts including murder and suicide.  At the same time, the company has also been accused of doing the bidding of repressive regimes by aggressively removing content that crosses governments and providing too little information on why certain posts and accounts are removed.  New policies will, for the first time, allow people to appeal a decision to take down an individual piece of content. Previously, only the removal of accounts, Groups and Pages could be appealed.  FILE PHOTO: A picture illustration shows a Facebook logo reflected in a person's eye, in Zenica, March 13, 2015. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  Facebook is also beginning to provide the specific reason why content is being taken down for a wider variety of situations.  Facebook, the world\u2019s largest social network, has become a dominant source of information in many countries around the world. It uses both automated software and an army of moderators that now numbers 7,500 to take down text, pictures and videos that violate its rules. Under pressure from several governments, it has been beefing up its moderator ranks since last year.  Bickert told Reuters in an interview that the standards are constantly evolving, based in part on feedback from more than 100 outside organizations and experts in areas such as counter-terrorism and child exploitation.  \u201cEverybody should expect that these will be updated frequently,\u201d she said.  The company considers changes to its content policy every two weeks at a meeting called the \u201cContent Standards Forum,\u201d led by Bickert. A small group of reporters was allowed to observe the meeting last week on the condition that they could describe process, but not substance.  At the April 17 meeting, about 25 employees sat around a conference table while others joined by video from New York, Dublin, Mexico City, Washington and elsewhere.  Attendees included people who specialize in public policy, legal matters, product development, communication and other areas. They heard reports from smaller working groups, relayed feedback they had gotten from civil rights groups and other outsiders and suggested ways that a policy or product could go wrong in the future. There was little mention of what competitors such as Alphabet Inc's Google GOOGL.O do in similar situations.  Bickert, a former U.S. federal prosecutor, posed questions, provided background and kept the discussion moving. The meeting lasted about an hour.  Facebook is planning a series of public forums in May and June in different countries to get more feedback on its rules, said Mary deBree, Facebook\u2019s head of content policy.  FROM CURSING TO MURDER  The longer version of the community standards document, some 8,000 words long, covers a wide array of words and images that Facebook sometimes censors, with detailed discussion of each category.  Videos of people wounded by cannibalism are not permitted, for instance, but such imagery is allowed with a warning screen if it is \u201cin a medical setting.\u201d  Facebook has long made clear that it does not allow people to buy and sell prescription drugs, marijuana or firearms on the social network, but the newly published document details what other speech on those subjects is permitted.  Content in which someone \u201cadmits to personal use of non-medical drugs\u201d should not be posted on Facebook, the rule book says.  The document elaborates on harassment and bullying, barring for example \u201ccursing at a minor.\u201d It also prohibits content that comes from a hacked source, \u201cexcept in limited cases of newsworthiness.\u201d  The new community standards do not incorporate separate procedures under which governments can demand the removal of content that violates local law.  In those cases, Bickert said, formal written requests are required and are reviewed by Facebook\u2019s legal team and outside attorneys. Content deemed to be permissible under community standards but in violation of local law - such as a prohibition in Thailand on disparaging the royal family - are then blocked in that country, but not globally.  The community standards also do not address false information - Facebook does not prohibit it but it does try to reduce its distribution - or other contentious issues such as use of personal data.","1080":"FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen placed on a keyboard in this illustration taken March 25, 2020.

In September, Facebook as well as YouTube and Twitter signed a deal with big advertisers to curb harmful content online.

It comes days after Australia passed laws forcing tech companies to help police access private user data, and amid growing concern from authorities worldwide about the giants\u2019 commercial behavior and distribution of so-called \u201cfake news\u201d.  \u201cWhen you get to a certain stage and you get market power, which both Google and Facebook have, with that comes special responsibilities and that means, also, additional scrutiny,\u201d Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Chairman Rod Sims told reporters in Sydney.  He said the companies\u2019 enormous market share - Google has a 94 percent share of web searches in Australia - and opaque methods for ranking advertisements gave the firms the ability and incentive to favor their businesses over advertisers\u2019.  \u201cThe idea of the regulator role would be to keep an eye on that and proactively bring some transparency,\u201d he said, adding the two firms also had outsized influence over news distribution.  Drafting the report had also spurred five investigations into possible consumer or privacy law breaches in Australia, Sims said, without disclosing which firms they concerned.  Facebook and Google, in separate statements, both said they will continue to work with the ACCC while the regulator prepares its final report due in June.  The two firms have already promised to do more to tackle the spread of fake news and, in submissions to the ACCC, said they provided users access to global news articles while providing advertisers a cheap way of reaching big audiences.  The ACCC has said its recommendations are subject to change, but suggests handing the new regulator investigative powers to examine how the companies rank advertisements and news articles.  \u201cIt is potentially a game changer,\u201d Margaret Simons, an associate professor of media at Monash University in Melbourne, said by phone, since it would bring the tech companies under a regulatory framework more typically applied to media firms.  \u201cWith the \u2018if\u2019 being whether or not governments act,\u201d she said, adding that the ACCC\u2019s work was being closely watched internationally.  Australia\u2019s government, which ordered the probe into the firms\u2019 influence a year ago as part of wider media reforms said it would consider the ACCC\u2019s final recommendations in June.  Traditional media companies in Australia including Nine Entertainment Co Holdings Ltd and News Corp\u2019s local arm - already squeezed by online rivals - welcomed the ACCC suggestions in separate statements on Monday.","1090":"FILE PHOTO: The Whatsapp logo and binary cyber codes are seen in this illustration taken November 26, 2019.

Bannon, a former Cambridge Analytica vice president, \"saw cultural warfare as a means to create enduring change in American politics,\" testified Christopher Wylie, who says information about tens of millions of Facebook FB.O users ended up in Cambridge Analytica's hands.  Bannon\u2019s attorney William Burck did not immediately respond to an email request for comment on Wylie\u2019s testimony.  Wylie, who worked for SCL, the British-based parent of Cambridge Analytica, told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Cambridge Analytica hired hackers to collect data it then used against opponents of its political clients.  Allegations of the improper use of data for 87 million Facebook users by Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign, have led to investigations in the United States and Europe.  Bannon worked on Trump\u2019s campaign and became a White House aide when Trump took office in January 2017. Bannon left in August 2017.  Wylie, who has provided reports about how the firm used data Facebook collected, on Wednesday described discussions at the company about suppressing the vote, exploiting racial tensions, and testing campaign slogans in 2014 for use in the 2016 election.

This claim is false.  Reuters Fact Check. REUTERS\/Axel Schmidt  Examples of this claim can be found here , here , and here .  The posts began circulating on social media in late August 2020 as the number of recorded U.S. deaths related to the novel coronavirus topped 180,000 ( here ).  President Donald Trump, downplaying the pandemic\u2019s domestic death toll ahead of the Nov. 3 election, shared the claim on Aug. 30 ( here ) in a Tweet that has since been removed by Twitter ( here ).  EXPLAINING COMORBIDITY  The claim that the CDC \u201cadmitted that only 6% of\u2026 (COVID-19-related) deaths recorded actually died from Covid\u201d is false, because the remaining 94% of cases were instances of comorbidity (the existence of two or more conditions or illnesses in a patient). This does not exclude COVID-19, but combines it with other illnesses, often triggered by the new coronavirus itself.  Iterations of the claim on Facebook include an authentic screenshot of a dataset on comorbidities from the CDC\u2019s provisional COVID-19 death count page ( here ). Although text above Table 3 says, \u201cFor 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned,\u201d the CDC did not mean that the other 94% of individuals did not die from novel coronavirus infection.  The table\u2019s left-most column, labeled \u201cConditions Contributing to Deaths where COVID-19 was listed on the death certificate,\u201d includes both serious complications from COVID-19 infection -- such as respiratory failure, pneumonia, and adult respiratory distress syndrome ( here ) \u2013 as well as pre-existing conditions that increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19, such as diabetes and obesity ( here ).  An emailed statement to Reuters from the Mortality Statistics Branch at the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) said death certificates, filled out by a physician, medical examiner, or coroner, list any causes or conditions that contributed to the person\u2019s death, determined based on the medical expertise of that professional. The condition \u201cthat began the chain of events that ultimately led to the person\u2019s death\u201d is considered the person\u2019s \u201cunderlying cause of death.\u201d  In these cases, this would be COVID-19.  The NCHS statement broke down the death certificates mentioning COVID-19. For 94% of people who had COVID-19 also had other conditions listed. COVID-19 alone was cause of death for 6%.  Dr. Maja Artandi ( here ), medical director of the Stanford CROWN Clinic for COVID-19 patients ( here ), told Reuters via email that the CDC\u2019s numbers \u201care really not a big surprise,\u201d as \u201cpatients who have a comorbidity such as diabetes, hypertension or obesity have a higher risk of getting seriously ill and dying from COVID-19.\u201d The numbers are also consistent with the fact that the novel coronavirus \u201ccan cause severe damage to the organs in the body such as the lungs, which then leads to respiratory failure and death.\u201d  Key to understanding the issues in these posts is that, \u201cIf they had not gotten the infection,\u201d Dr. Artandi said, \u201cthey would still be alive.\u201d  Dr. Marc Larsen, an emergency medicine physician who serves as Incident Command Operations Chair for COVID-19 at St. Luke\u2019s Hospital in Kansas City, Kansas ( here ), told Reuters via email that when filling out death certificates, physicians will typically use a standard format and list the primary cause of death as well as other contributing factors.  He provided an analogy to someone dying of a gunshot wound whose death certificate might list gunshot wound, along with hemorrhagic shock and liver laceration, as causes of death, with homelessness (associated with more exposure to potential violence, here ), as a contributing factor. For someone who died of COVID-19, the death certificate might read COVID-19, as well as pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) as causes of death, with diabetes and hypertension as contributing factors.  Dr. Larsen said that in both cases, \u201cwithout those two triggers,\u201d a gunshot wound and COVID-19, \u201cthe death would not have occurred. Nothing that appears after those primary diagnoses would have transpired had it not been for the primary event. In these examples, the patients did not die directly from being homeless or being diabetic with hypertension, however, they were contributing factors.\u201d  On Sept. 1, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), debunked the claim on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America ( here ).  Asked to explain \u201cwhy the president would retweet a theory that suggests only 9,000 people have died of COVID-19,\u201d Fauci said, \u201cThe point that the CDC was trying to make was that a certain percentage of (Americans who have died of COVID-19) had nothing else but just COVID. That does not mean that someone who has hypertension or diabetes who dies of COVID didn\u2019t die of COVID-19. They did.\u201d  He then confirmed that the recorded 180,000 American deaths \u201care real deaths from COVID-19.\u201d  DATA LAGS AND DEATH COUNT ISSUES  At the time the screenshot in the posts was taken, the provisional COVID-19 death count was at 153,504. Using Wayback Machine, an Internet archive tool, this number reflected CDC data as of August 15 and was on the CDC\u2019s website from August 17 ( here ).  As explained by the CDC here, COVID-19 death counts may vary \u201cas data currently are lagged by an average of 1\u20132 weeks.\u201d Because the data here comes from processed death certificates, a note under Table 1 explains, \u201cthis delay can range from 1 week to 8 weeks or more, depending on the jurisdiction, age, and cause of death.\u201d  (Data collected using other methodologies, such as the CDC COVID Data Tracker here or the tracking tool provided by Reuters here may therefore reflect a higher COVID-19 death count.)  The posts also falsely allege that the CDC \u201cquietly updated\u201d its COVID-19 data in August to say that \u201cfor 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned.\u201d The page included the latest comorbidity data as early as May 8, at that time reporting that 7% of deaths had COVID-19 listed as the sole cause of death ( here ). The NCHS also told Reuters it has been publishing this information since it began posting data on COVID-19 deaths on its website.  The posts claim most recorded COVID-19 deaths were individuals of \u201cvery advanced age\u201d. While 79% of the 161,392 deaths recorded by the provisional CDC death count were of those over 65 years old, 31.5%, or less than a third, were of those over 85 (see Table 3 here ).  VERDICT  False. The 6% figure represents death certificates with COVID-19 listed as the only cause of death, but the remaining death certificates listed additional conditions, either COVID-19 complications or pre-existing illnesses, along with COVID-19.

FILE PHOTO: A vendor weighs vegetable next to an advertisement of Paytm, a digital payments firm, hanging amidst his vegetables at a roadside market in Mumbai, India, April 2, 2019. REUTERS\/Francis Mascarenhas  Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp, which has been working on gaining regulatory approval for payments services in India, is gearing up for a full rollout of those services by June, according to a source familiar with the matter.  The partnership with Reliance, announced on Wednesday, will give WhatsApp an inside track on payments for Reliance\u2019s retail unit, which aims to serve tens of millions of small shops across India. It will also be able to link up with Reliance\u2019s telecoms business, which has taken the market by storm since its launch in late 2016, and WhatsApp itself has an enormous presence in India with more than 400 million users.  \u201cIf someone would have lost sleep as the Facebook-Reliance deal was announced, it must be Vijay Shekhar Sharma,\u201d said a second source, referring to Paytm\u2019s founder.  The source, who has close ties to both Reliance and Paytm, declined to be identified to protect business interests.  Compared to other major players in India's digital payments markets, Paytm is seen as more vulnerable to attack, already on the backfoot amid competition from Alphabet's GOOGL.O Google Pay and Walmart's WMT.N PhonePe.  While having previously attracted investments from the likes of Japan's SoftBank 9984.T, China's Alibaba BABA.N and U.S.-based Berkshire Hathaway BRKa.N, it lacks its own wells of capital for funding, putting it at a disadvantage.  Paytm also remains unprofitable, with its parent firm reporting a loss of over $500 million in the year ended March 2019.  Launched a decade ago as a platform for mobile recharging, Paytm grew quickly after ride-hailing firm Uber UBER.N listed it as a quick payment option. Its use swelled further in 2016 when a ban on high-value currency notes spurred digital payments.  But it underestimated the impact of a state-backed digital payment system that was rolled out in 2016. On that network, Google Pay and PhonePe together accounted for nearly 80% of 1.31 billion transactions in January. Paytm was a distant third with about 10%, according to data from payments firm Razorpay.  India\u2019s digital payments market is expected to more than double in size to $135 billion in 2023 from 2019 levels, according to a study by PwC and Indian industry lobby group ASSOCHAM.  Individual market share can, however, be difficult to assess. Paytm has branched out into services including insurance and gold sales, movie and flight ticketing, and bank deposits and remittances.  Paytm declined to comment.  GOLIATH-LIKE OPPONENT  Paytm has long seen the threat posed by WhatsApp, and when the messaging service launched a trial of its payment services in early 2018, Sharma accused Facebook of \u201ccheap tricks\u201d.  Paytm was also part of a lobbying campaign against U.S. firms over local data storage - an issue now mostly resolved but which had been an impediment to WhatsApp gaining regulatory approval. With Reliance behind it, WhatsApp\u2019s path to final approval for the payment service is now expected to be smooth.  On one hand, the market is expanding, and sources familiar with the matter say Paytm has seen a boost in transactions as the COVID-19 crisis pushes commerce online.  But the Reliance-Facebook combination represents a Goliath-like opponent, especially given Reliance\u2019s track record in decimating rivals when it entered the telecoms market with Jio Infocomm and cut-throat pricing.  \u201cThis is a formidable combination of bandwidth and platform player so it will easily shake up the payments industry,\u201d said Ashvin Parekh, an independent financial services consultant.  He added that in any bruising battle over digital payments, a telecom firm like Reliance\u2019s Jio would be hard to beat as it has far more insight into consumer data habits and a greater number of stores to reach potential customers.  Paytm has raised more than $3 billion since it was founded, with the most recent infusion of $1 billion coming last autumn. But should it need more, fundraising now looks far more difficult. SoftBank, its biggest investor, has problems of its own and has backed away from pouring more funds into money-losing startups.  A recent move by India to intensify scrutiny of Chinese investments in the country could also complicate any future fundraising efforts.","1103":"FILE PHOTO: The Google logo is pictured at the entrance to the Google offices in London, Britain January 18, 2019. REUTERS\/Hannah McKay  (Reuters) - Australia\u2019s antitrust regulator on Tuesday rejected an undertaking by Alphabet Inc-owned Google that sought to address competition concerns over its planned $2.1 billion acquisition of fitness tracker maker Fitbit.  The development comes as Google remains at loggerheads with the Australian government over a number of issues, including proposed laws that will make Australia the first country in the world to force Google and Facebook to pay for news sourced from local media outlets.  In June, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) voiced concerns over the Fitbit deal, warning Google\u2019s acquisition would give it too much of people\u2019s data, potentially hurting competition in health and online advertising markets.  Google had sought to address those concerns by offering a court enforceable undertaking that it would behave in certain ways toward rival wearable manufacturers, not use health data for advertising and, in some circumstances, allow competing businesses access to health and fitness data.  \u201cWhile we are aware that the European Commission recently accepted a similar undertaking from Google, we are not satisfied that a long-term behavioural undertaking of this type in such a complex and dynamic industry could be effectively monitored and enforced in Australia,\u201d ACCC Chair Rod Sims said in a statement.  The regulator also noted that several other competition authorities, including the U.S. Department of Justice, were yet to make a decision on the deal.  The ACCC said it would continue its investigation and set a new decision date of March 25, 2021.  The regulator also has inquiries open into advertising technology and mobile app stores, with reports due in January and March, respectively, focusing on the rapidly growing market power of internet giants.","1104":"* Oil prices up, energy stocks bounce  * Facebook says it faces questions from U.S. FTC  * FOMC policy meeting kicks off, guidance eyed  * Dow up 0.52 pct, S&P 500 up 0.14 pct, Nasdaq up 0.21 pct (Updates to mid-afternoon, changes byline)  By Chuck Mikolajczak  March 20 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged up on Tuesday as higher oil prices buoyed the energy sector, but another slump in Facebook Inc shares curbed gains.  Oil prices rose more than 2 percent to touch a three-week high, driven by tensions in the Middle East and the possibility of further declines in Venezuelan crude output.  Those gains helped the S&P energy index up 0.95 percent, making it easily the best performing of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors.  Facebook Inc shares were down 4.2 percent. The social media company said on Tuesday it faced questions from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission about how its users\u2019 personal data was mined by a political consultancy hired by President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign.  The stock has fallen about 12 percent over the past two session, on track for its biggest two-day decline since July 2012 in a drop that has weighed heavily on equities.  U.S. and European lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how the consultancy gained access to the data and why Facebook failed to inform its users, raising broader industry questions about consumer privacy and whether heavier regulation is on the horizon.  Shares of Snap Inc fell 3.56 percent, while Twitter Inc shares tumbled 9.47 percent. The Global X Social Media ETF lost 1.2 percent.  \u201cThere is a secular issue with Facebook \u2013 time spent and user growth.

Facebook was the biggest drag on both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 while the Dow, which does not include the social media company, had the largest gain of the three major Wall Street indexes.  Oracle dropped 8.7 percent after the business software maker reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue.  Financial stocks edged up 0.27 percent as investors awaited a near-certain interest rate hike at the end of the Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day meeting on Wednesday.  Market participants largely expect a total of three rate hikes this year, although some have not written off the possibility the Fed will hike four times.  Shares of defense companies gained after Reuters reported Trump plans to boost the exports of lethal drones to more U.S. allies. Kratos Defense rose 3.7 percent and Boeing Co gained 1.9 percent.

Sandberg, speaking during the Reuters Next conference, said she was glad that Facebook had frozen Trump\u2019s accounts, which came as tech giants scrambled to crack down on his baseless claims about fraud in the U.S. presidential election amid riots in Washington last week.  Hours later, the company banned the phrase \u201cstop the steal\u201d altogether, citing use of the term to organize events contesting the outcome of the U.S. presidential election that have a propensity for violence.  If Trump wanted to appeal the removal of his content, that could happen through the company\u2019s new Oversight Board, she added. Facebook said Trump could not appeal the actual suspension through the board.  \u201cThis shows the president is not above the policies we have,\u201d Sandberg said, speaking with Reuters Breakingviews columnist Gina Chon.  Facebook executives have long taken a light touch to policing speech posted by politicians, maintaining that people have a right to see statements from their leaders.  The company backed down somewhat on that position and started applying labels to the president\u2019s posts after facing a backlash this summer, including an advertiser boycott, when it declined to act against Trump\u2019s incendiary rhetoric around anti-racism protests throughout the United States.

REUTERS\/Philippe Wojazer\/File Photo  It reversed course and banned Trump indefinitely following last week\u2019s riots, which culminated in the storming of the U.S. Capitol.  Facebook\u2019s stock closed down 4% on Monday, as social networks\u2019 moves against Trump spurred concern among investors over future regulation. Twitter, which permanently suspended Trump, tumbled over 6% while Alphabet lost 2%.  Violent rhetoric on social media platforms including Facebook had ramped up in the weeks preceding the rallies as groups planned openly for the gatherings, according to researchers and public postings, prompting criticism of the companies for failing to take action in advance.  Sandberg acknowledged that Facebook may have missed some of those posts but said she believed the events were largely organized on other platforms.  She said the company was keeping an eye on further possible armed protests being planned for Washington, D.C. and at all 50 U.S. state capital cities in the run-up to President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20, which has prompted an FBI warning.  Asked why Facebook had not taken comparable action against other leaders like Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and President Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, who likewise have been accused of inciting violence online, Sandberg said the company\u2019s policies would apply globally.  \u2018I\u2019M STAYING\u2019  Sandberg has played a less prominent public role at Facebook in the past year, even as CEO Mark Zuckerberg has thrown himself into the public sphere with a series of livestreamed chats and multiple sessions testifying before Congress.  The two have also faced questions about their future at Facebook following the mid-year return of Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, who had left the year prior citing vague differences over the company\u2019s direction.  Asked about the future for herself and Zuckerberg at Facebook, Sandberg said both were staying put in their current roles.  \u201cI\u2019m staying,\u201d she said, adding that she and Zuckerberg \u201cfeel we have a real responsibility to fix the systems that didn\u2019t work before to protect our service and to make sure great things can happen,\u201d Sandberg added.  Sandberg also denied reports that she had been sidelined as Zuckerberg took a more active role in content policy and government relations, her traditional areas of responsibility.  \u201cPeople love headlines about corporate drama, and I think it\u2019s fair to say they particularly love headlines about sidelining women. But I just feel tremendously lucky to have this job because there is so much good,\u201d she said.  Sandberg said regulatory pressure on U.S. tech companies around antitrust issues was \u201cvery real,\u201d cautioning similar scrutiny two decades ago was a \u201cmajor distraction\u201d for Microsoft Corp and caused it to miss the next phase of technology development.  \u201cWe know that history, and we have to both work on these serious issues, work with the government, work on reforming the rules that govern us - which need to be reformed - and keep innovating,\u201d she said.  ---  For more coverage from the Reuters Next conference, please click here here or.

REUTERS\/Adrees Latif  (Reuters) - Facebook has started removing false claims that the deadly wildfires in Oregon were started by various left-wing and right-wing groups, a spokesman for the social media company said on Saturday, after the rumors left state officials inundated with queries for information.  Since early this week, state officials have been attempting to debunk misinformation on social media that has blamed both left-wing and right-wing groups for the fires that have killed at least six people in Oregon this week.  Facebook, which earlier was attaching warning labels to such posts, decided to move to the stricter approach after \u201cconfirmation from law enforcement that these rumors are forcing local fire and police agencies to divert resources from fighting the fires and protecting the public,\u201d the spokesman, Andy Stone, said in a statement on Twitter.  Stone called the decision \u201cconsistent with (Facebook\u2019s) past efforts to remove content that could lead to imminent harm given the possible risk to human life as the fires rage on.\u201d  Flames have destroyed thousands homes in days, making Oregon the latest epicenter in a larger summer outbreak of fires sweeping the western United States.  One of Facebook\u2019s third-party fact-checking partners, PolitiFact, wrote on Thursday on its website that dozens of posts blaming antifa - a largely unstructured, far-left movement - for the wildfires had been flagged by Facebook\u2019s systems, and that collectively the posts had been shared thousands of times.  The FBI on Friday said in a statement that after investigating several reports that extremists were responsible for setting wildfires in Oregon, it found them to be untrue.  Earlier this week, police in Medford, Oregon, debunked a false post using the police department\u2019s logo and name suggesting that five members of the Proud Boys, a men-only, far-right group, had been arrested for arson.","1109":"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Facebook has removed 103 pages, groups and accounts that were part of a network it said was linked to employees of the Pakistani military\u2019s public relations arm, the social media group announced on Monday.

Facebook\u2019s announcement comes at a time when it has been facing increasing pressure across the world over the use of its platforms by politically aligned groups, many of which conceal their true identity.  The 24 pages, 57 accounts and 7 groups removed on Facebook had more than 2.8 million followers. An additional 15 Instagram accounts were also removed.

An analysis of the pages, accounts, and groups by the Atlantic Council think tank\u2019s digital forensic lab said the tone of the pages in questions strongly supported Pakistan and attacked India, consistent with ISPR\u2019s behaviour\u201d.

A number of journalists and activists critical of the military on social media have been threatened and abducted in the past two years. Three men who were abducted for five weeks in 2017 told Reuters and other news outlets that they had been taken by the military\u2019s spy wing.  \u201cWinning the war of narratives and making the dissenting voices irrelevant in cyberspace is possibly their main aim,\u201d Shahzad Ahmad of digital rights group Bytes for All told Reuters.  \u201cThey are organized, well-resourced groups with a sense of purpose, we call them cyber armies.\u201d  Last week, Facebook removed a social media network in the Philippines and took the unusual step of linking it to a businessman who said he had managed the president\u2019s online election campaign in 2016.

Reuters Fact Check. REUTERS  The screenshot, which was posted to Facebook and Twitter (here, here), comes from a data research website called Macrotrends and lists \u201chistorical death rate data\u201d year-on-year between 1950 and 2020.  In 2020, the table shows the global death rate to be at 7.612 per 1,000 people, which is a rate marginally higher than that from 2016 through 2019 but is lower than 2015 and all years prior to this. In other words, apart from the four years between 2016 and 2019, the data in the table for 2020 appears to indicate the global death rate is at its lowest in nearly 70 years.  Social media users have picked up on this and have used it to question the true impact of COVID-19, with one Facebook user one writing: \u201cWhy is the world\u2019s death rate in 2020 one of the lowest in the past 15 years? And there\u2019s a \u201cdeadly\u201d pandemic happening? How is that possible?\u201d  In the comments section underneath the post, the same user appears to suggest the pandemic is \u201ca fear tactic\u201d. She wrote: \u201cTheir [sic] are doctors and nurses coming forward to say their [sic] are no covid patients\/deaths...... I know 2 doctors very well. This is all a fear tactic.\u201d  But the data used to make this assumption is misleading. The page on Macrotrends, itself, features a disclaimer at the top noting that 2020 data does not account for COVID-19 deaths. It also lists its data source as the United Nations (UN), which published the latest World Population Prospects in June 2019 (here). The death rates per 1,000 people listed in the UN spreadsheet are close to those published by Macrotrends \u2013 although not identical. This was explained by a UN spokesperson as the data being approximations and could therefore mean Macrotrends interpolated its own version by using the UN\u2019s five-year data.  It\u2019s important to note that these figures were published in June 2019, using data that is available up until the end of 2018 \u2013 and, for some countries, up to several years earlier. Therefore, the death rate listed in the table for 2020 is a projection based on data from years prior to the pandemic taking hold.  The UN spokesperson also told Reuters that the marginal increase seen in the projection for 2020 could be explained by global rates linked to increased population ageing and past population growth. This has nothing to do with the pandemic.  VERDICT  False. Worldwide death rate data from 2019 does not erode the severity of the coronavirus pandemic as the 2020 rate is a projection based on data from years prior to COVID-19 being recognised as an illness.

The Cambridge Analytica scandal emerged only a few months before a landmark EU data protection law comes into force under which companies found to be in breach could be fined up to 4 percent of global turnover.

Technology shares fell 0.3 percent as Facebook\u2019s data privacy travails persisted. Facebook was down 2 percent, adding to a 9 percent loss in the past two days in the wake of an uproar over the alleged misuse of users\u2019 data.  The energy index gained 1.15 percent, mirroring a jump in crude oil prices that neared their highest in six weeks after a surprise decline in U.S. inventories and as concern persisted over possible disruption to Middle East supply.  The markets are also jittery about the possibility of a global trade war after the Wall Street Journal said China was planning countermeasures to the Trump administration\u2019s threatened import duties. Equity futures dipped earlier in the day on the news.  That adds to the nerves about what kind of monetary policy regime will be pursued by new Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.  \u201cThere has been some worry off-and-on for sometime now.

The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.16 percent to 7,352.43.  Among stocks, General Mills slumped about 10 percent after the company cut its full-year profit forecast due to higher freight and commodity costs.  That weighed on other food companies, with Kellogg down 4 percent and JM Smucker and ConAgra down 3.6 percent.  The Fed is widely seen raising its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points when it concludes the first meeting of the Jerome Powell era at 2:00 p.m. ET.  While markets are sure about the quarter-point hike, they are less confident of what the Fed signals next: three hikes this year, as previously forecast by policy makers, or four.  Some investors believe that corporate tax cuts and recent hints of inflation pressures will push policymakers to add an additional increase beyond the expected three.  One worry among equity investors is faster rate hikes could dent the appeal of stocks relative to bonds. Stocks remain relatively expensive despite recent pull backs.

The strong comments from the most powerful U.S. financial regulator underscored the growing regulatory hurdles facing the proposed cryptocurrency, which has drawn scrutiny from policymakers globally.  \u201cLibra raises many serious concerns regarding privacy, money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability,\u201d Powell said during his semi-annual testimony on monetary policy before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee.  \u201cI don\u2019t think the project can go forward\u201d without addressing those concerns, he added later.  Powell said any regulatory review of the project should be \u201cpatient and careful.\u201d He noted that existing rules do not fit digital currencies.  \u201cIt\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t fit neatly or easily within our regulatory scheme but it does have potentially systemic scale,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needs a careful look, so I strongly believe we all need to be taking our time with this.\u201d  \u201cWe are very much aligned with the Chairman around the need for public discourse on this,\u201d Facebook spokeswoman Elka Looks said in an email. \u201cThis is why we along with the 27 other Founding Members of the Libra Association made this announcement so far in advance, so that we could engage in constructive discourse on this and get feedback.\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Powell\u2019s comments about Libra hit the price of bitcoin, which fell as much as 7% during his three hours of testimony.  Late last month, bitcoin climbed back to near $14,000 and has rallied by more than 30% since June 18, when Facebook announced plans to launch Libra. By mid-afternoon on Wednesday bitcoin was trading at $12,268.99, down 2.4% on the day. Facebook shares, too, took a hit during Powell\u2019s appearance before the committee, although they largely recovered that lost ground and were trading 1.3% higher at $201.89 a share.  WORKING GROUP  It was unclear exactly how the Fed could slow the project if it wanted, given the murky regulatory treatment of digital currencies, but Powell\u2019s perspective looms large. Facebook officials are scheduled to testify about the project later this month in Congress, where senior lawmakers have raised data privacy and other concerns.  \u201cWhat Facebook is planning raises serious privacy, trading, national security, and monetary policy concerns for consumers, investors, the U.S. economy and the global economy,\u201d said Representative Maxine Waters, who chairs the House banking panel.  Powell said the Fed has established a working group to follow the project and is coordinating with other central banks across the globe. He also expects a review from the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council, a panel of regulators charged with identifying broad risks to the financial system.  Powell noted that he supports financial innovation as long as appropriate risks are identified, but he said the massive platform enjoyed by Facebook immediately sets Libra apart from other digital currency projects.  \u201cFacebook has a couple billion-plus users, so I think you have for the first time the possibility of very broad adoption,\u201d he said.  Any problems that could emerge through Libra \u201cwould arise to systemically important levels just because of the mere size of Facebook.\u201d","1115":"Jan 28 (Reuters) - Deciding its first cases, Facebook Inc\u2019s oversight board ruled on Thursday that the social media company was wrong to remove four of five pieces of content the board reviewed, including posts Facebook took down for violating rules on hate speech and harmful COVID-19 misinformation.  The rulings are a crucial test of the independent body, created by Facebook in response to criticism of the way it treats problematic content. The board also called for Facebook to be clearer about its rules on what is allowed on its platforms.  The board has been in the spotlight after the company last week asked it to rule on the recent suspension of former U.S. President Donald Trump. It said on Thursday it would soon be opening the case up for public comment.  Facebook blocked Trump\u2019s access to his Facebook and Instagram accounts over concerns of further violent unrest following the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol by the former president\u2019s supporters.  Facebook\u2019s oversight board started hearing cases in October and announced the first cases it would review in December. Here is the full list of the board\u2019s rulings:  DECISIONS OVERTURNED: * A post with photos of a deceased child that included commentary on China\u2019s treatment of Uighur Muslims. * An alleged quote from Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels that Facebook removed for violating its policy on \u201cdangerous individuals and organizations.\u201d * A post in a group claiming certain drugs could cure COVID-19, which criticized the French government\u2019s response to the pandemic. This case was submitted by Facebook, rather than a user. * Instagram photos showing female nipples that the user in Brazil said aimed to raise awareness of breast cancer symptoms. Facebook had also said this removal was an error and restored the post.  DECISION UPHELD: * A post that purported to show historical photos of churches in Baku, Azerbaijan, with a caption that Facebook said indicated \u201cdisdain\u201d for Azerbaijani people and support for Armenia.  Facebook now has seven days to restore the pieces of content that the board ruled should not have been taken down. The board said it would shortly announce one more case from its first batch.  The board also issued nine nonbinding policy recommendations - for example that Facebook should tell users the specific rule they have violated and better define their rules on issues like dangerous groups and health misinformation. Facebook doesn\u2019t have to act on these, but it does have to publicly respond.  Facebook has long faced criticism for high-profile content moderation issues, ranging from temporarily removing a famous Vietnam-era war photo of a naked girl fleeing a napalm attack to failings in policing hate speech and misinformation.  The board will rule on a limited number of controversial decisions. It said on Thursday that 150,000 cases had been appealed to the board since it started accepting cases in October.  The board has 20 members including former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Tawakkol Karman.  The panel hears cases from users who have exhausted the company\u2019s appeals process on content removed from Facebook\u2019s platforms, not content that has been left up. The board\u2019s limited remit has been the subject of criticism. Facebook itself can ask the board to review a wider range of content problems.  Before the rulings were announced, a group of Facebook critics, dubbed The Real Oversight Board, said they were \u201ca PR effort that obfuscates the urgent issues that Facebook continually fails to address - the continued proliferation of hate speech and disinformation on their platforms.\u201d  Facebook has pledged $130 million to fund the board for at least six years.","1116":"March 26 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc said on Tuesday it has removed more accounts from Iran, Russia, Macedonia and Kosovo, citing what it described as \u201ccoordinated inauthentic behavior.\u201d  A total of 2,632 pages, groups and accounts were removed from Facebook and Instagram for operations linked to the above mentioned countries, the social media platform said bit.ly\/2U6jXcH.

FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen placed on a keyboard in this illustration taken March 25, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The U.S. social media giant said in a blog post that it believed the mechanism, Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), had been deemed valid by the Court of Justice of the European Union in July, adding:  \u201cWe will continue to transfer data in compliance with the recent CJEU ruling and until we receive further guidance.\u201d  Facebook said the Irish Data Protection Commission, Facebook\u2019s lead regulator in the EU, had \u201ccommenced an inquiry into Facebook controlled EU-US data transfers, and has suggested that SCCs cannot in practice be used for EU-US data transfers\u201d.  The Wall Street Journal reported that the Commission had sent Facebook a preliminary order to suspend transfers to the United States of data about users in the European Union.  A spokesman for the Commission declined to comment on the report.  The transatlantic argument stems from EU concerns that the surveillance regime in the United States may not respect the privacy rights of EU citizens when their personal data is sent to the United States for commercial use.  Facebook said that, while the Commission\u2019s approach was subject to further process, \u201cif followed, it could have a far reaching effect on businesses that rely on SCCs and on the online services many people and businesses rely on\u201d.  \u2018PRIVACY SHIELD\u2019  Europe\u2019s highest court in July ruled that the main transatlantic data transfer deal hammered out between Brussels and Washington - Privacy Shield - was invalid because of concerns about U.S. surveillance.  But the judges upheld the validity of the transfer mechanism known as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).  These are used by thousands of companies to transfer Europeans\u2019 data around the world for services ranging from cloud infrastructure, data hosting, payroll and finance to marketing.  However, the court stressed that under SCCs, privacy watchdogs must suspend or prohibit transfers outside the EU if data protection in other countries cannot be assured.  Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems, who brought the legal proceedings, said at the time that this meant companies that fall under U.S. surveillance laws, such as Facebook, could not use the clauses to shift data to the United States.  In its post, Facebook said that \u201cthe rationale in invalidating Privacy Shield has nonetheless created significant uncertainty - not just for US tech companies\u201d.  It said it was setting out its position on how to proceed with international data transfers in a European Data Protection Board taskforce considering how to apply the CJEU ruling.  It said it was also putting \u201crobust safeguards\u201d in place to protect user data, such as \u201cindustry standard encryption and security measures, and comprehensive policies governing how we respond to legal requests for data\u201d.","1123":"FILE PHOTO: Small toy figures are seen on representations of virtual currency in front of the Libra logo in this illustration picture, June 21, 2019.

REUTERS\/Robert Galbraith  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Facebook\u2019s future could look like Microsoft\u2019s past. Tumbling valuations and regulatory attacks crushed the shares of Bill Gates\u2019 software juggernaut nearly two decades ago. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s $463 billion social network is growing fast. That\u2019s no reason, though, to assume that Facebook will be immune to the same kind of risks.  On Wednesday, Facebook reported a 49 percent increase in revenue in the first three months of this year from a year earlier, notching up $12 billion. That\u2019s almost all advertising sales and puts to rest, for now at least, worries that Madison Avenue was set to shun the social network after a data leak exposed the accounts of more than 87 million members and prompted Zuckerberg to make a rare journey to Washington to testify in front of lawmakers. The company even managed to return to modest growth in daily active members from the United States and Canada.  Advertisers are usually the last to leave the party, however. The challenges Facebook is up against are still intact. Bipartisan committees in Congress could follow their counterparts in Europe, enacting privacy-related or other regulations that could clip Facebook\u2019s growth.  Microsoft may be a helpful proxy. The company behind the Windows operating system had to battle U.S. watchdogs in the late 1990s. It dodged a breakup but the stock took a beating. Throw in the dot-com bust, and the shares lost nearly two-thirds of their value in about a year starting at the end of 1999. Microsoft achieved respectable growth in its top and bottom lines for some 15 years before its stock price regained the old peak.  Facebook shares are already down nearly 20 percent from their February peak. Laws preventing it from collecting user data could dampen advertisers\u2019 enthusiasm. Another factor to consider is a recession, when advertising spending by big brands and small businesses traditionally falls off a cliff. A further slide in tech stocks \u2013 and the market as a whole \u2013 can\u2019t be ruled out, either. Zuckerberg\u2019s business has the stickiness of a network but lacks the industry-standard demand that kept Microsoft going. Times change, but history can still rhyme.","1128":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook\u2019s former sustainability chief has launched an organization to help employees at big companies press their bosses for more aggressive policies to fight climate change.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  Hundreds of companies have committed to reducing emissions in their own operations to be in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement, in which governments aim to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius.  Beyond their own operations, however, many companies have refrained from advocating for broader solutions needed to avoid a global catastrophe, said Bill Weihl, who led sustainability efforts at Facebook and Google and will head the new organization, ClimateVoice.  Employees at tech companies have objected to selling cloud services to Big Oil, and companies are reticent to exert lobbying influence on behalf of specific legislation.  \u201cWhen it\u2019s an issue that might be really important for society but doesn\u2019t directly affect them, by and large most companies are silent most of the time,\u201d said Weihl, who left Facebook in 2018.  ClimateVoice is launching as a volunteer effort but aims to raise funds and hire staff soon after launch. Weihl said it will seek to organize and amplify climate activism among tech employees to push executives to lobby on behalf of legislative efforts around climate.  Workers have become a key constituency in the climate change debate, particularly at the biggest tech companies. Microsoft and Amazon announced more ambitious emissions targets after employees ultimately made their concerns publicly known.  Bruce Hahne resigned as a technical program manager at Google this month and criticized the company in a public letter for selling technology to the energy sector to more efficiently produce fossil fuels -- echoing concerns raised by workers at Amazon and Microsoft.  \u201cWe\u2019re dying by fire, and the Google Cloud oil and gas sales vertical is pouring on the gasoline,\u201d Hahne wrote.  Google respresentatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  ClimateVoice initially intends to advocate for legislation at the U.S. state and regional levels, instead of the U.S. Congress. The group could be useful in providing employees with a list of policy priorities to raise with their bosses, Hahne told Reuters. It could also help bring together workers at different companies, who could work together on proposed bills with less fear of management retaliation.  \u201cClimateVoice is going to need to design sets of tactical behaviors that work well with cultures of the organizations, and that are safe,\u201d Hahne said.","1129":"(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Facebook Inc acquisitions were aimed at buying up potential rivals before they could become a threat to the social media company, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.  FILE PHOTO: Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chairman Joe Simons announces that Facebook Inc has agreed to a settlement of allegations it mishandled user privacy during a news conference at FTC Headquarters in Washington, U.S., July 24, 2019. REUTERS\/Yuri Gripas\/File Photo  The company\u2019s acquisition practices are the main focus of the probe, as the FTC looks into Facebook buying technology-based startups to keep them from challenging it, the report said.  The world\u2019s largest social network has purchased nearly 90 companies since 2003, according to data provided by S&P Global. Those include messaging service WhatsApp and image sharing app Instagram, both of which have since grown into social behemoths in their own right.  Facebook last week said the FTC had opened an antitrust investigation in June looking into the areas of \u201csocial networking or social media services, digital advertising, and\/or mobile or online applications.\u201d  Both FTC and Facebook, whose shares Facebook shares fell 0.77% declined to comment on the report.  The U.S. Justice Department said on July 23 it was opening a broad review of major digital technology firms, looking into whether they engage in anticompetitive practices, a clear signal that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is stepping up its scrutiny of the industry.  In June, Reuters reported that the FTC and the Justice Department, which enforce U.S. antitrust laws, have divided oversight over the big four tech companies, with Amazon.com Inc and Facebook under the watch of the FTC, and Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google under the Justice Department.  Last month, Facebook settled an FTC probe into allegations of inappropriately sharing data of 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. Facebook will pay a record-breaking $5 billion fine.  The company has increasingly relied on its acquisitions to power growth in recent years, as the number of new users signing up for its core \u201cblue app\u201d has tapered off in lucrative markets. According to its most recent figures, more than 2.7 billion people use one of Facebook\u2019s family of apps each month.  While Facebook does not release user or revenue figures for each service, executives presenting the company\u2019s earnings last week cited Instagram as a key driver of ad impression growth, the company\u2019s main source of revenue.  George Hay, a professor of antitrust law at Cornell University and a former Justice Department lawyer, said the FTC\u2019s investigation of Facebook is likely to focus on section two of the Sherman Act, which makes it unlawful to acquire monopoly power through improper means.  Facebook will likely argue that there were valid, pro-consumer justifications for its acquisitions, and Hay said it may be difficult for the FTC to prove the transactions undermined competition.  \u201cIt is a possible theory, but it is not a compelling theory,\u201d Hay said. \u201cI think the FTC will do a thorough job but it is not obvious to me they will build a case out of it.\u201d  In Washington, Democrats and Republicans alike have expressed growing concern about the size of the largest tech firms and their market power. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for breaking up companies like Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook and unwinding prior acquisitions.  In July, the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust panel pressed executives from the four firms about their competitive practices and noted that Google, Facebook, Amazon had a rising share of key markets.  Members of Congress have also expressed concern about Facebook\u2019s control of vast amounts of user data, citing the Cambridge Analytica scandal and a string of other privacy breaches.  It is rare for the U.S. government to seek to undo a consummated deal. The most famous case in recent memory is the government\u2019s effort to break up Microsoft Corp. The Justice Department won a preliminary victory in 2000 but was reversed on appeal. The case settled with Microsoft intact.","1130":"BEIJING (Reuters) - China\u2019s largely rubber stamp parliament has passed a new law on cryptography as the country gears up to launch its own digital currency, state media reported late on Saturday.  China\u2019s central bank set up a research team in 2014 to explore launching its own digital currency to cut the costs of circulating traditional paper money and boost policymakers\u2019 control of money supply.  China\u2019s proposed new digital currency would bear some similarities to Facebook Inc\u2019s Libra coin and would be able to be used across major payment platforms such as WeChat and Alipay, a senior central bank official said last month.  China\u2019s cryptography law, which takes effect on Jan. 1, is aimed at \u201cfacilitating the development of the cryptography business and ensuring the security of cyberspace and information\u201d, the official Xinhua news agency said, citing parliament. The law states that the state encourages and supports the research and application of science and technology in cryptography and ensures confidentiality.  Facebook\u2019s proposed cryptocurrency has sparked concerns among global regulators that it could quickly become a dominant form of digital payment and a channel for money laundering given the social network\u2019s massive cross-border reach.  Libra will be a digital currency backed by a reserve of real-world assets, including bank deposits and short-term government securities, and held by a network of custodians. Its structure is intended to foster trust and stabilize the price.  Like other cryptocurrencies, Libra transactions will be powered and recorded by a blockchain, which is a shared ledger of transactions maintained by a network of computers.

Small toy figures are seen on representations of virtual currency in front of the Libra logo in this illustration picture, June 21, 2019. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  Facebook drew worldwide interest this week when it announced plans to introduce a cryptocurrency called Libra, part of an effort to expand into digital payments.  Facebook said Libra would be backed by real-world assets, including bank deposits and short-term government securities, to make it more stable -- and thus practical for payments and money transfers -- than other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.  With the potential to reach billions of internet users and the backing of payment giants like Visa, Facebook hopes Libra will not only power transactions but offer people without bank accounts access to financial services for the first time.  But the central bankers of Britain, France and Germany said Facebook should expect scrutiny.  \u201cIt has to be safe, or it\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Bank of England Governor Mark Carney told the BBC in an interview broadcast on Friday.  \u201cWe, the Fed, all the major global central banks and supervisors, would have direct regulatory (oversight),\u201d he said, referring to the U.S. Federal Reserve.  Global central bankers have so far largely refrained from regulating digital currencies, having failed last year to reach an agreement on how to do so and concluding they were too small to pose a risk to the financial system.  Other global regulators have been monitoring the growth of cryptocurrencies. The Financial Action Task Force, a Paris-based global anti-money-laundering watchdog, is expected to announce rules to address the use of digital coins for illegal purposes.  But Libra\u2019s announcement has put the issue back on their radar, with the focus now shifting from bitcoin to so-called stablecoins, such as Facebook\u2019s Libra, that are backed by real-world assets.  France said on Friday it would create a task force on the matter as part of its presidency of the Group of Seven club of the world\u2019s seven largest economies. It will be chaired by European Central Bank board member Benoit Coeure.  \u201cIt will in the coming months examine the anti-money laundering requirements, but also those of consumer protection and operational resilience and any issues relating to monetary policy transmission,\u201d said France\u2019s central bank governor, Villeroy de Galhau.  His German counterpart, Jens Weidmann, warned that stablecoins could undermine banks if they became a widespread alternative to bank deposits in conventional currencies.  \u201cThey could undermine the deposit-taking of banks and their business models,\u201d Weidmann said on Friday. \u201cThis might disrupt transaction banking and financial market intermediation.\u201d  One of the issues to be considered by the G7 task force is custodianship, or where and how the official currencies underpinning the tokens would be stored, according to a letter seen by Reuters.  This is a crucial point for stablecoins. Tether, the highest-profile stablecoin, with coins worth around $3.6 billion in existence, has faced questions over whether it holds enough U.S. dollars to back the tokens in circulation. The company has said it has sufficient reserves.  Facebook is grappling with public backlash after a series of scandals ranging from privacy breaches to accusations that it is restricting freedom of speech.","1133":"FILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is displayed on a smartphone in this illustration taken January 6, 2020.

Facebook announced a similar partnership with Alphabet-owned Google Photos in April.  The feature that allows such transfers is called data portability. It gives users more control over their data and allows the social media company to respond to U.S. regulators and lawmakers who are investigating its competitive practices and allegations it has stifled competition.  Facebook\u2019s move comes ahead of a hearing set up by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Sept. 22 to examine the potential benefits and challenges of data portability. Control of data that hurts competition has become a critical topic in the antitrust debate in the United States and Europe.  Earlier this month, Facebook sent comments to the FTC in which it pushed for data portability legislation.  Facebook also said a portability bill called the Access Act, already doing the rounds in Congress from Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal and Mark Warner and Republican senator Josh Hawley, is a good first step and that it will continue engaing with lawmakers on it.  Smaller technology companies will be more willing to partner with Facebook once regulations around data portability become more clear, Bijan Madhani, privacy and public policy manager at Facebook told Reuters.  Data portability is a requirement under Europe\u2019s privacy law called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California\u2019s privacy law called the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).","1134":"LONDON (Reuters) - Facebook's FB.O Libra project has no solid plan yet for how or where it will be launched next year, a member of the board that will oversee the cryptocurrency told Reuters on Thursday.  FILE PHOTO: Representations of virtual currency are displayed in front of the Libra logo in this illustration picture, June 21, 2019. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  The scope of Libra\u2019s introduction, due by the end of June, depends on talks with regulators, said Patrick Ellis, one of five board members of the Geneva-based Libra Association that will issue and govern the digital currency.  \u201cAt this stage, there is no strategy set in stone for the markets or the product, or how it will actually get rolled out,\u201d Ellis said in a telephone interview from Singapore.  The prospect of Libra gaining traction among Facebook\u2019s nearly 2.4 billion users has raised concerns among regulators around the world, who are nervous that it could radically alter the global financial landscape.  Officials running the project, including co-creator David Marcus of Facebook, have said regulatory hurdles could see the launch delayed beyond the planned June launch date.  Asked if the cryptocurrency would launch in 2020, Ellis said: \u201cYes. Yes, it\u2019ll launch.\u201d  Regulators have expressed concerns about Libra\u2019s potential to erode countries\u2019 control over their monetary policy and upset financial stability across the world.  U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard launched the latest broadside against the project on Wednesday, saying it faced a \u201ccore set of legal and regulatory challenges\u201d and that its \u201cstablecoin\u201d concept remained unproven.  Libra will be backed by a reserve of assets such as bank deposits and government debt, held by a network of custodians. The structure is meant to foster trust and avoid the price swings that plague other cryptocurrencies.  Brainard\u2019s remarks highlight the challenges facing Libra.  \u201cIt\u2019s just too early to put a solid strategy in place,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cWe have still got so much to solve with the regulators in order to be able to then refine the strategy for launch.\u201d  Talks between Libra and regulators in Europe, the United States and southeast Asia were progressing, Ellis said. He declined to give details on the steps Libra is taking to respond to the regulators\u2019 worries.  Some of Facebook\u2019s original backers, including Mastercard and Visa, ditched the project in October.  Netherlands-based PayU, of which Ellis is general counsel, is the only remaining international payments firm among the association\u2019s 21 members.  All members have to contribute a minimum of $10 million to be part of the Libra network.  Apart from Facebook, none have currently contributed any money to the project, Ellis said. Contributions are on track to begin in the first or second quarter next year, he said.","1135":"March 2 (Reuters) -  * FACEBOOK IS DROPPING OUT OF SXSW CONFERENCE IN AUSTIN, TEXAS, DUE TO CORONAVIRUS FEARS- BUSINESS INSIDER Source text: bit.ly\/2TiCWiI Further company coverage:","1136":"GENEVA (Reuters) - Social media firms and foreign investors must do more to ensure they support human rights in Myanmar, U.N.

FILE PHOTO: Silhouettes of laptop users are seen next to a screen projection of Facebook logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  Myanmar has been trying to attract foreign investors and divert attention from 730,000 Rohingya Muslims who have fled the country since 2017. A U.N. inquiry blamed the exodus on a military campaign with \u201cgenocidal intent\u201d, which the government denies.  Facebook said this month it had banned four insurgent groups fighting Myanmar\u2019s military after it was criticized for not doing enough to block content fuelling the conflict. Lee said she was concerned that Facebook had not banned Myanmar\u2019s army and allied armed groups as well.  \u201cContrary to achieving the stated aim of decreasing tensions, this selective banning may contribute to feelings of inequality by ethnic minorities,\u201d Lee said in a report she will present to the U.N. Human Rights Council on March 11.  \u201cPublic institutions linked to the military, its supporters, extremist religious groups and members of the government continue to proliferate hate speech and misinformation on Facebook.\u201d  INVESTIGATIONS  The company said it had taken steps to ban \u201chate figures, hate organizations and military officials\u201d from Facebook in Myanmar. Its investigations were ongoing and not limited to the four groups it had blacklisted.  \u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone to use Facebook to incite or promote violence, no matter who they are,\u201d it said in a statement.  Lee\u2019s report did not detail steps taken by other social media firms. But it aims to ensure platforms \u201cincluding Facebook and Twitter\u201d respect human rights and do due diligence to \u201cfully understand the Myanmar context and act responsibly\u201d.  Twitter, which prohibits account holders from expressing hate or making threats of violence toward a person or group, declined to comment specifically on Myanmar.  Myanmar denies allegations of mass killings and rape, and says its military offensive was a legitimate response to an insurgent threat and that it is welcoming the refugees back.  The government has refused to let Lee in and rejected a request to visit in January, saying her reports invariably lacked impartiality.  Last week Kyaw Tin, Myanmar\u2019s Minister for International Cooperation, told the council human rights must be understood in historical and cultural contexts, and regretted the world\u2019s focus on Rakhine State, from where the Rohingya fled.  Lee\u2019s report also examined Myanmar\u2019s mining industry.  \u201cUnchecked extraction\u201d of resources brought militarization and associated abuses such as rape and forced labor, it said.

REUTERS\/Joshua Robertsle  The social media platform said Stone and his associates, including a prominent supporter of the right-wing Proud Boys group in Stone\u2019s home state of Florida, had used fake accounts and followers to promote Stone\u2019s books and posts.  Facebook moved against Stone on the same day it took down accounts tied to employees of the family of Brazilian leader Jair Bolsonaro and two other networks connected to domestic political operations in Ecuador and Ukraine.  Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy, said the removals were meant to show that artificially inflating engagement for political impact would be stopped, no matter how well connected the practitioners.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what they\u2019re saying, and it doesn\u2019t matter who they are,\u201d Gleicher told Reuters before the announcement on the company's blog bit.ly\/2Z7QSzc. \u201cWe expect we\u2019re going to see more political actors cross this line and use coordinated inauthentic behavior to try to influence public debate.\u201d  Facebook officials said they took down Stone\u2019s personal Facebook and Instagram pages and his Stone Cold Truth Facebook page, which had 141,000 followers. A total of 54 Facebook accounts and 50 pages were removed for misbehavior, including the creation of fake accounts. The accounts spent more than $300,000 on advertisements over the past few years, Facebook said.  Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg was briefed on the actions beforehand, officials said.  The removals risk further angering Trump and other conservatives who accuse Facebook of suppressing right-wing voices. Facebook last month took down a Trump re-election ad that included a Nazi symbol, and it pledged to steer users to facts on voting when Trump, or anyone else, touches on the topic.  Facebook is under pressure from civil rights advocates and allied groups as well, and hundreds of advertisers have joined a boycott demanding the company crack down on hateful and divisive messages.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Stone was convicted last year for witness tampering and lying to Congress as it and former Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election.  In a lengthy email, Stone said he did not control fake accounts and that his accounts had no connection to the Proud Boys.  \u201cI am being censored by Facebook and Twitter because my social media postings expose the truth regarding the now discredited Mueller investigation and the Russian Collusion hoax as well as the unfairness of my trial in 2020 to the extent possible without violating the protective seal left in place by the court and because I am an outspoken supporter of President Trump,\u201d Stone wrote.  In search warrant documents released this April, the FBI said a Stone assistant told interviewers in 2018 \u201cthat he purchased a couple hundred fake Facebook accounts as part of this work.\u201d  Facebook said its probe was influenced by the April search documents. But the company said that its unit guarding against coordinated inauthentic behavior had already been looking into Stone\u2019s pages after a referral from a separate Facebook team monitoring dangerous organizations, which was tracking the Proud Boys.  Facebook marked the Proud Boys as dangerous and banned their content in 2018. Members have been charged with violence in multiple instances and recently clashed with anti-racism protesters.  One of the accounts connected to the Proud Boys was operated by Jacob Engels, Facebook said. Stone testified last year that Engels could post on Instagram on his behalf and had access to his phone.  Engels, who writes for far-right sites, told Reuters he is not a member of the Proud Boys but has \u201cembedded\u201d with them to research the group.  Graphika analyst Ben Nimmo, a disinformation specialist, said the Stone network had been most active in 2016 and 2017, among other things promoting stories about the Democratic emails published by WikiLeaks as part of the Russian interference effort.  Many of the accounts were later deleted, and in recent weeks they have mostly reflected Stone\u2019s quest to receive a pardon from Trump for his crimes, according to Nimmo.  \u201cThe inauthentic accounts were amplifying various Stone assets, like his page, or advertising one of his books,\u201d Nimmo said.  Stone has been stepping up his efforts to get a pardon from Trump before he reports to prison, where his family fears the spread of COVID-19. Trump has said that Stone was treated unfairly, and his attorney general intervened to seek a lesser sentence, prompting four career prosecutors to resign from the case.","1140":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic senators proposed legislation on Tuesday that would set penalties for online companies like Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Facebook Inc if they mishandle users\u2019 personal data.

REUTERS\/Loren Elliott  The measure comes at a time when the luster of the Big Tech platforms, once praised as one of the most dynamic parts of the U.S. economy, has faded because of data breaches and discomfort over what information about people is being collected and what it is used for.  The proposed bill, called the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act, would allow people to see what information is collected about them, require that it be deleted and prevent its sale. It also allows consumers to file lawsuits if online businesses break rules.  Companies would also have to get a consumer\u2019s permission to share any sensitive data, which the bill defines broadly enough to include location, biometrics, email address or telephone number.  \u201cThe key thing is that obviously you have to have privacy rights. It should be clear and you should know what they are,\u201d Senator Maria Cantwell said in an interview.  Federal privacy legislation has been expected because of industry concern over California\u2019s new privacy law, and the prospect of other states passing measures that effectively create a patchwork of different rules across the country.  Cantwell said that her proposed bill spelled out what Democrats wanted in a privacy law. \u201cWe are in discussions with Republicans,\u201d she said.  In addition to Cantwell and Senator Amy Klobuchar, the bill is backed by Senators Brian Schatz and Ed Markey. The bill will be introduced when the Senate comes back from recess, a Cantwell aide said.  Under the measure, a new office within the Federal Trade Commission would enforce new privacy rules. It would be allowed to fine companies for privacy violations. The fines were not spelled out by the bill.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  In a statement on Tuesday, Germany\u2019s Federal Office of Justice said that by tallying only certain categories of complaints, the web giant had created a skewed picture of the extent of violations on its platform.  Faced with a global backlash over the role its platform played in election campaigns from the United States and Britain to the Philippines, Facebook has been on a public relations drive to improve its image.  But Facebook said it had complied with its transparency obligations under the law, known as \u2018NetzDG\u2019, adding that some aspects of the law \u201clacked clarity\u201d. Facebook said it reserved the right to appeal the ruling after studying it.  Under Germany\u2019s network transparency law, social media platforms are required to report the number of complaints of illegal content they have received. The charge that Facebook did not report the full extent of the complaints it received could undermine its efforts to burnish its reputation.  Newly appointed Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht said the option for making a complaint under the transparency law was harder to find on Facebook than an option for complaining that a post violated the platform\u2019s community standards.  \u201cIt is quite clear that Facebook\u2019s community standards do not correspond to the standards of the law,\u201d she told reporters at Frankfurt Airport.  Tallying only reports made under the harder-to-find complaints procedure led to artificially low numbers.  In 2018, Facebook said it had received 1,048 complaints relating to illegal content on its platform over the second half of that year, according to its transparency report.  By contrast, transparency reports from Twitter and Google\u2019s YouTube video service both reported well over a quarter of a million complaints for the whole year.  \u201cWe want to remove hate speech as quickly and effectively as possible and work hard to do so,\u201d said a Facebook spokesman in response to the fine.  \u201cWe are confident our published NetzDG reports are in accordance with the law, but as many critics have pointed out, this law lacks clarity.\u201d  Scarred by the memory of the two authoritarian police states on its territory over the past century, Germany has some of the world\u2019s strictest privacy and hate speech laws, latterly combined with some of the strictest social media regulations.","1144":"(Updates shares, adds loss of market value)  May 1 (Reuters) - Like an old flame wrecking a first date, Facebook Inc burst in on the matchmaking scene on Tuesday and sent investors in rival apps on a panicked rush for the door.  Shares of Match Group Inc and its parent IAC plunged, wiping some $5 billion off their combined market values, after Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said his social media platform would develop its own dating app to rival Tinder, Match and others.  Tinder became known for users swiping right on their cellphones to indicate interest for a potential match and swiping left to reject someone.  Match fell 22 percent \u2013 its largest one-day drop ever \u2013 and IAC, which owns more than a fifth of Match, fell nearly 18 percent in its biggest daily loss in about 13 years.  Spark Networks, owner of JDate and Christian Mingle, also closed 4 percent lower.  Although analysts said Facebook\u2019s initial foray would not likely be a threat to established dating sites - some of which are highly specialized to cater to specific groups - its heft and deep pockets makes it a concern over the long term to the smaller companies.  Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said there was \u201csignificant potential for Facebook to be a big problem for Match,\u201d but one that was dependent on execution over the long term.  Facebook brings to the dating table a treasure trove of data on its active users, which are over 2 billion strong. That could potentially allow it to match people more effectively than rival sites with less data at their fingertips. But privacy concerns surrounding the technology behemoth could discourage some from embracing such a service, some analysts said.  Daniel Kurnos, an analyst at the Benchmark Company, also cited the difficulty of creating a popular dating site, cautioning that it was not an overnight project and one that requires much more than sheer machine learning.  \u201cI think the reaction is a combination of the Facebook news along with concerns that Match was getting toppy,\u201d or expensive, Kurnos told Reuters. \u201cI can\u2019t see Facebook supplanting Match any time soon \u2013 too big a moat.\u201d  Facebook connects friends and acquaintances but until now, has not delved into the domain of match-making, where a host of competitors offer services, from privately held eHarmony to IAC-owned OkCupid and PlentyOfFish.  One problem for Tinder is that their users can log in to their accounts using Facebook.  That has been one way Tinder has assured that their users are real people, noted Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi.  \u201cWhen you\u2019re a Facebook user, and over time you became aware of a comparable service, then it\u2019s less likely that you will go on to Tinder,\u201d Mogharabi noted.  On the other hand, the lower average age of Tinder users could be a competitive advantage for the Match company, he added.  Data from research firm eMarketer shows that approximately 27 percent of smartphone users are single, a number expected to grow to 35 percent in the next five years.","1145":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc said on Friday that businesses running paid online events on its iOS app would not need to pay a 30% fee to Apple for the remainder of 2020, temporarily defusing a standoff between the two tech giants.

Apple said Friday that such online events have always been subject to its in-app payment rules, which charge commissions between 15% and 30% of the purchase price of paid online events.  Apple said it has given businesses affected by the pandemic more time to implement the system and that Facebook is getting the same exemption until year\u2019s end it has given ClassPass and Airbnb.  Gaming creators will not receive the exemption because the service was launched in early 2018 and it is not a physical business affected by the pandemic, Apple said.  \u201cApple maintains a clear, consistent set of guidelines that apply equally to everyone,\u201d Apple said in a statement.  Facebook challenged Apple\u2019s rules last month, attempting to tell users in an app update that the iPhone maker would take a cut of sales for a new online events feature, but later removed the message after Apple rejected the update.  The world\u2019s biggest social media company cast the move as a defense of small businesses and app developers, joining other developers such as \u201cFortnite\u201d creator Epic Games, which is suing Apple on antitrust allegations over the fees.  Facebook is also wrangling with Apple over new privacy rules for iPhones that will require more notifications before tracking users across apps.  The social media giant said Apple\u2019s decision to lift the fees came with a catch excluding game creators from being able to use Facebook Pay in paid online events on iOS.  \u201cWe unfortunately had to make this concession to get the temporary reprieve for other businesses,\u201d said Vivek Sharma, vice president of Facebook Gaming.

The social networking giant has been rocked this week after a whistleblower said Cambridge Analytica, which U.S. President Donald Trump hired for his 2016 election campaign, improperly accessed information on Facebook users to build detailed profiles on American voters.  \u201cThere was very little detection or enforcement,\u201d Parakilas said in testimony via videolink before the House of Common\u2019s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. \u201cDuring my 16 months (at Facebook), I don\u2019t remember a single physical audit of a developer\u201d who was storing users\u2019 data from the social network.  Parakilas highlighted vast potential abuses of a little-understood feature known as \u201cfriend permissions\u201d, which enabled software developers to connect their apps up to the friends of users, and even the friends of friends, the so-called \u201csocial graph\u201d at the heart of Facebook\u2019s network of connections.  \u201cYou are likely talking about tens of thousands of apps that got \u2018friend permissions\u2019 and some of those apps had tens - it was huge - or hundreds of millions of users, so there was a vast (amount) of data that passed out the door,\u201d Parakilas said.  Facebook turned off the friend permissions feature in 2015.  Asked by a parliamentary committee member whether there were incidents where this data-sharing feature was misused, Parakilas said: \u201cThere may well have been. However, Facebook did not investigate deeply enough to determine exactly.\u201d  Facebook declined to comment directly on the testimony of the ex-employee.

The poll found that many people take a dim view of those \u201ctargeted\u201d advertisements.  Some 63 percent said they would like to see \u201cless targeted advertising\u201d in the future, while 9 percent said they wanted more.

Curran said she knows online retailer Amazon.com also collects her information for targeted marketing, but that it is less annoying because it is a shopping site, not a place for personal conversations.

Facebook Inc FB.O has come under fire in recent weeks over its decision to not fact-check ads run by politicians. The new ad comes days after Green New Deal champion Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez grilled Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on whether his site would allow such an ad.  \u201cCould I run ads targeting Republicans in primaries saying that they voted for the Green New Deal?,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez asked the tech executive at a congressional hearing on Wednesday.  \u201cCongresswoman, I don\u2019t know the answer to that off the top of my head,\u201d Zuckerberg replied. \u201cI think probably.\u201d  Facebook has drawn criticism over its ad policy from Democratic candidates running in the 2020 presidential election such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren.  Last week, Zuckerberg said Facebook did not want to stifle political expression.  Facebook spokesman Tom Channick said that since the new ad came from a political action group, rather than a politician, it was eligible for review by the company\u2019s third-party fact-checking partners.  A screengrab from a video shows U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) appearing in a Facebook ad run by a PAC called The Really Online Lefty League, which falsely claims that he supports the Green New Deal, in order to draw attention to issues around Facebook ad policies, October 25, 2019. The Really Online Lefty League\/Facebook via REUTERS.  \u201cWe have sent it to them for review,\u201d Channick told Reuters, adding that the ad would be removed if found to be false.  The new ad cycles through archive footage of Republicans such as former Presidents Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon before splicing together two real videos of Graham to make it look as if he said, \u201cWe believe in the Green New Deal.\u201d It also mentions the false endorsement in the ad text.  Senator Graham\u2019s office said it was aware of the ad and confirmed the senator opposes the Green New Deal, a proposal championed by Ocasio-Cortez that would eliminate U.S. greenhouse gas emissions within a decade.  Graham has previously called the proposal a \u201cdisaster\u201d and said it would \u201cdestroy the American economy.\u201d  Adriel Hampton, treasurer of the group behind the ad, The Really Online Lefty League, said he came up with the idea to draw attention to the problems around false claims in online political advertising. He has spent $50 to show the ad online.  \u201cThere appears to be little to nothing to stop serious election manipulation through false advertising, and that\u2019s bad for our democracy,\u201d Hampton said in an email to Reuters.  Ahead of the November 2020 election, lawmakers have also expressed concerns over the spread of misinformation through manipulated video, particularly deepfakes, which use machine learning to create realistic content where a person appears to say or do something they did not.  The video of Graham was manually edited, Hampton said. \u201cNo deepfakes needed,\u201d he said. \u201cVery low-budget, very easy to do.\u201d  He said that he intended the false claim to be obvious to spot by including the claim that Graham endorsed the Green New Deal in the ad\u2019s text.  \u201cWhile a lot of people think our ad is funny, we\u2019ve seen a lot of folks taking it at face value, and THAT is alarming,\u201d he added.","1151":"SAN FRANCISCO\/WASHINGTON, April 11 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg returns to Capitol Hill on Wednesday for more questioning by lawmakers who have a rare chance to air grievances about the company directly to the head of the world\u2019s largest social media network.  The internet magnate is scheduled to testify at 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT) before the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee, a day after he appeared for nearly five hours before a U.S. Senate hearing.  Zuckerberg, wearing a dark suit instead of his usual gray T-shirt, navigated through the first hearing on Tuesday without making any further promises to support new legislation or change how the social network does business, foiling attempts by senators to pin him down.  Investors were impressed with his initial performance. Shares in Facebook posted their biggest daily gain in nearly two years, closing up 4.5 percent on Tuesday.  Facebook has been consumed by turmoil for nearly a month, since it came to light that millions of users\u2019 personal information was wrongly harvested from the website by Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that has counted U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign among its clients. The latest estimate of affected users is up to 87 million.  Patience with the social network had already worn thin among users, advertisers and investors after the company said last year that Russia used Facebook for years to try to sway U.S. politics, an allegation Moscow denies.  Lawmakers have sought assurances that Facebook can effectively police itself, and few came away from Tuesday\u2019s hearing expressing confidence in the social network.  \u201cI don\u2019t want to vote to have to regulate Facebook, but by God, I will,\u201d Republican Senator John Kennedy told Zuckerberg on Tuesday. \u201cA lot of that depends on you.\u201d  Zuckerberg deflected requests to support specific legislation.

The market is projected to be worth $3.2 billion by research firm IDC and is fast becoming crowded with entrants that also include Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Cisco Systems Inc and Atlassian Corp Plc.  Facebook\u2019s Workplace product will gain a so-called Integration Directory of more than 50 software services including Microsoft Corp\u2019s SharePoint, SurveyMonkey and Atlassian\u2019s Jira, which helps developers manage projects and build software.  These workplace collaboration tools stand to serve as influential hubs from which office workers access the business software they use.  Facebook, which introduced Workplace in late 2016, claimed in October that more than 30,000 organizations use the product, including Match Group Inc , which owns Tinder, Farmers Insurance Group and Starbucks Corp . The company declined to provide recent figures or share how many organizations pay for the premium service.

He received a frosty welcome from Democratic lawmakers and several Republicans, who shared many of the same concerns.  \u201cI don\u2019t trust you guys,\u201d said Republican Senator Martha McSally. \u201cInstead of cleaning up your house you are launching into a new business model.\u201d  Marcus, who was president of PayPal from 2012 to 2014, tried to assuage concerns by promising that Facebook will not begin offering Libra until regulatory issues are addressed. \u201cWe know we need to take the time to get this right,\u201d Marcus, who is also due to testify before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, told lawmakers.  Lawmakers raised a range of concerns, including about how the company plans to prevent money laundering, how consumers\u2019 data and funds will be protected and how the Geneva-based association created to run the system will be regulated.  \u201cI know we have to earn people\u2019s trust for a very long period of time,\u201d Marcus said when asked whether consumers could trust Facebook not to share their payment information.  The social media company has pledged that its payments subsidiary called Calibra will only share customer data with Facebook and external third parties if it has consent, or in \u201climited cases,\u201d where it is necessary.  Slideshow ( 15 images )  UNDER WRAPS  Critics have expressed anger that the company would advance such a potentially groundbreaking project so far without extensive input from policymakers, especially when the company was already in the spotlight over privacy issues.  Facebook allocated a small fraction of its vast workforce to work on the project, Kevin Weil, who runs product for the Libra initiative, told Reuters on June 18.  Slideshow ( 15 images )  One former employee told Reuters the company tried to keep the project under wraps even internally. Staff who were not involved knew little about it, not even that it was operating under the name Libra.  In the weeks leading up to the announcement, the company began reaching out formally to key regulators including the Federal Reserve, the Treasury and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But two people with knowledge of the discussions said the conversations remained vague, with key details of the project discussed only on a theoretical level.  On Tuesday, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair Jay Clayton told Reuters on the sidelines of a Washington event that he had not discussed the Libra project with Facebook since its announcement but would welcome more information.  Some lawmakers have been frustrated by the lack of clarity from Facebook before and since June 18, three congressional sources said. One Democratic aide described the company\u2019s contacts with lawmakers as \u201cinept and entitled.\u201d Facebook has said that it announced the project in its early stages to get feedback from stakeholders, a point Marcus reiterated at the hearing on Tuesday.","1164":"SYDNEY, April 20 (Reuters) - Australia will pass legislation within months obliging Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google to share advertising revenue with local media firms, the country\u2019s treasurer said on Monday, becoming one of the first countries to require digital platforms to pay for content they use.  Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in a statement the move comes after talks with Facebook and Alphabet failed to yield a voluntary code to address complaints by domestic media players that the tech giants have too tight a grip on advertising, their main source of income.  \u201cOn the fundamental issue of payment for content, which the code was seeking to resolve, there was no meaningful progress,\u201d the treasurer said in a separate opinion piece in The Australian newspaper.  Australia\u2019s online advertising market is worth about worth almost A$9 billion ($5.72 billion) a year and has grown more than eight-fold since 2005, Frydenberg wrote. For every A$100 spent on online advertising in Australia, excluding classifieds, nearly a third goes to Google and Facebook.  Last December, Australia said Google and Facebook would have to agree to new rules to ensure they do not abuse their market power and damage competition, or the government would impose new controls.  On Monday Frydenberg said the government has now asked the country\u2019s competition watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to develop a mandatory code of conduct between media outlets and digital platforms.  The initial plan to come up a voluntary code by November has been scrapped, Frydenberg said. The ACCC will submit its draft mandatory code by July, to be passed into legislation shortly thereafter, he said.  \u201cThe problem with that is that some of that information they are providing consumers for free has come from people who have invested a lot of money in journalism and the case of media to provide that content,\u201d ACCC Chairman Rod Sims told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.  Facebook expressed dismay at the government move on Monday.  \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed by the government\u2019s announcement, especially as we\u2019ve worked hard to meet their agreed deadline,\u201d Facebook said.  \u201cWe\u2019ve invested millions of dollars locally to support Australian publishers through content arrangements, partnerships and training for the industry,\u201d Facebook Australia and New Zealand Managing Director Will Easton said in an emailed statement.  Google said it would continue to cooperate with plans for the media code of conduct.  \u201cWe have sought to work constructively with industry, the ACCC and government to develop a code of conduct, and we will continue to do so in the revised process set out by the Government today,\u201d a Google spokesperson said.  Monday\u2019s move also comes as the new coronavirus pandemic hits Australia\u2019s media business hard, with several regional outlets reporting steep declines in advertising revenue.  Pending the new code, the federal government last week unveiled a support package for the local media businesses including a 12-month waiver of spectrum tax for commercial television and radio broadcasters, and a A$50 million public interest news gathering programme.

The accounts removed in Thailand used \u201cfictitious personas\u201d to promote narratives about Thai politics, U.S.-China relations, protests in Hong Kong, and criticism of democracy activists in Thailand, Gleicher said.  \u201cWe were able to determine conclusively that some of the activities of this network was linked to an individual based in Thailand associated with New Eastern Outlook, a Russian government-funded journal based in Moscow,\u201d Gleicher said.

Company officials also said they removed accounts falsely claiming allegiance to antifa in order to bring discredit to the anti-fascist movement.  Antifa adherents have said they focus on defending people from attacks by authorities or vigilantes, but they have been vilified by President Donald Trump who, without citing evidence, said they were instigators of anti-police violence.  Some of the removed white nationalist accounts were associated with the Proud Boys, which Facebook previously classified as a dangerous group. The others had connections to a group called the American Guard, which is now classified the same way.  Multiple Facebook executives described the action on condition they not be identified. They said they acted based on behavior, not the politics of any content, and that Facebook had not designated antifa as dangerous.  The company said it was looking closer at accounts discussing protests when it saw what it deemed white nationalist accounts encouraging violence.

As with a false antifa tweet that Twitter Inc TWTR.N tied to a third white nationalist group and which was widely distributed as a screen shot, the Facebook executives said Tuesday the goal of such content is often not to win thousands of followers but to plant a single false flag that can be used to sow distrust about the target group.

Facebook did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement, which requires court approval.  The accord followed Facebook\u2019s $5 billion settlement last year with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which arose from the company\u2019s having allowed British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to harvest data for an estimated 87 million users.

Facebook had originally been sued in 2015, when users accused the Menlo Park, California-based company of violating Illinois\u2019 Biometric Information Privacy Act by using facial recognition technology to collect biometric data.  Users said Facebook did this by obtaining data through its \u201cTag Suggestions\u201d feature, which allowed users to recognize Facebook friends from previously uploaded photos.  The settlement boosted Facebook\u2019s expenses for the fourth quarter, though profit still totaled $7.35 billion, up 7%.

Give people back their goddamn freedom,\u201d Musk said.  Zuckerberg, on the other hand, in comments on Facebook's FB.O own earnings calls, expressed concerns about easing lockdown measure and said the economic fallout from the pandemic would last longer than people are currently anticipating.  \u201cI worry that reopening certain places too quickly before infection rates have been reduced to very minimal levels will almost guarantee future outbreaks and worse longer-term health and economic outcomes,\u201d he said.

Electric carmaker Tesla and social media network Facebook have had different experiences under the lockdown. Tesla had initially resisted efforts by California authorities to shut its plant in the Bay Area under the lockdown, until agreeing on March 19 to suspend production. Even so, Tesla on Wednesday reported its third profitable quarter in a row.

Wall Street favorites in recent years, the FANG stocks have been punished in a month of volatility for U.S. equities that has some investors worried a decade-old bull market may be ending.  The FANG group, along with heavyweight tech stocks Apple and Microsoft MSFT.O, have made outsized contributions to the S&P 500's gains in recent years, and a prolonged downturn for those stocks would be a major setback for the market.

That missed analyst estimates of $57.1 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Firstly, there is no data from the WHO that says flu jabs kill. Any calculations made with reference to such data are therefore invalid.  The WHO maintains the influenza vaccination is \u201cproven to be safe\u201d with reports of severe side effects being \u201cextremely rare\u201d (here).

According to the Oxford Vaccine Group, there were a total 130 reports of anaphylaxis in the UK after all types of immunisation between 1997 and 2003. That\u2019s a rate of 1 case of anaphylaxis in 900,000 vaccinations, considering 117 million doses were given during that six-year period (here).  Around 14 million people in the UK were vaccinated against influenza in the 2019-20 season (here). Figures for the full 2020-21 season are not yet available.

A total of 26 million influenza vaccinations (14 million in 2019-20; 12 million and counting in 2020-21) does not mean 26 million different people in the UK have been vaccinated.

Research has shown Filipinos to be among the most active social media users in the world, spending on average more than four hours a day on platforms like Facebook.  Duterte, a former mayor from outside of the sphere of national politics, tapped into social media to help him win a 2016 election by a huge margin.  Last year, lawmakers began an inquiry into the proliferation of what they saw as fake news on the internet.  Duterte spokesman Harry Roque welcomed Facebook\u2019s desire to counter fake news, but he noted some people had complained that \u201cthe chosen police of the truth are sometimes partisan themselves\u201d.  A Facebook spokeswoman did not comment on the government\u2019s protest and referred Reuters to a statement last week announcing the partnership with Rappler and VERA Files.  \u201cPartnering with third-party fact-checking organizations, is one of the ways we hope to better identify and reduce the reach of false news that people share on our platform,\u201d Clair Deevy, Facebook\u2019s director for community affairs for Asia Pacific, said last week.  There was no immediate comment from Rappler.  Ellen Tordesillas, president of VERA Files, said \u201cnon-partisanship and fairness are among the requirements for an international fact-checking network accreditation\u201d.  VERA Files and Rappler IQ are the only two Philippine-based members of an international fact-checking network at the Poynter Institute, a journalism school in the United States.

Trump posted a photo with Zuckerberg on Twitter and called their session a \"nice meeting\" in the Oval Office. Facebook FB.O said the tech executive \"had a good, constructive meeting with President Trump at the White House today.\" Neither side disclosed specifics of their discussion.  Trump has castigated Facebook repeatedly, accusing it of being biased in favor of Democrats. The company has faced a barrage of other criticism over privacy lapses, election-related activity and its dominance in online advertising, giving rise to calls for more regulation and anti-trust investigations.  Wearing a suit and tie rather than his usual hoodie, Zuckerberg met on Thursday, the second day of the three-day visit, with Senators Josh Hawley, Tom Cotton and Mike Lee. He also had dinner with lawmakers, including Senator Richard Blumenthal, on Wednesday evening.  Zuckerberg took no questions from reporters as he moved from office to office on Capitol Hill. He will meet with House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and Representative Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, on Friday and will meet with several high-ranking House Democrats.  After his meeting with the Facebook founder, Hawley, a tough critic, said that discussions had been \u201cfrank,\u201d often a euphemism for contentious. He urged Zuckerberg to sell Facebook\u2019s Instagram and WhatsApp units, which would limit how much information it could compile about an individual from different sources.  \u201cI said to him, \u2018Prove that you\u2019re serious about data. Sell WhatsApp. And sell Instagram,\u2019\u201d Hawley told reporters. \u201cSafe to say he was not receptive to those suggestions.\u201d  Hawley has accused Facebook of suppressing conservative speech including when it found this month that statements on the anti-abortion group Live Action\u2019s Facebook page were false and temporarily restricted access to it.  Hawley expressed exasperation with the CEO\u2019s acknowledgement that restricting access to the page had been an error.

I\u2019d like to see some action.\u201d  Slideshow ( 8 images )  BUILDING BRIDGES  Despite the harsh words, Zuckerberg\u2019s trip appeared aimed at building bridges with Congress. While some lawmakers like Hawley were quick to upbraid the CEO, several senators praised Zuckerberg for taking extensive time to meet.  Democratic Senator Mark Warner told Fox Business Network, \u201cFacebook leadership realizes that failure to have federal legislation (on internet issues) is actually going to hurt them and the whole platform industry in the long run.\u201d  Facebook has spent the last several years under fire for a string of lapses including inappropriately sharing information belonging to 87 million users with a now-defunct British political consultancy, triggering a $5 billion fine.  The company, which is an advertising powerhouse, faces antitrust investigations by the Federal Trade Commission and a number of state attorneys general, as well as numerous legislative proposals that seek to restrict how it operates.  It may also face an antitrust probe by the U.S. Justice Department. Senator Lee was critical of what he saw as duplication in federal investigations in a hearing on Tuesday.","1182":"WASHINGTON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Senator Maria Cantwell, backed by three other Democrats, proposed legislation that would set penalties for digital giants like Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Facebook Inc if they mishandle users\u2019 personal data, the Washington Post reported on Tuesday.  The measure comes at a time when the luster of the Big Tech platforms, once praised as one of the most dynamic parts of the U.S. economy, has faded because of data breaches and discomfort over what information about people is being collected and what it is used for.  Cantwell\u2019s bill, called the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act, would allow people to see what information is collected about them and prevent its sale. It also allows consumers to file lawsuits if online businesses break rules, the Post said.  Under the measure, the Federal Trade Commission would be allowed to fine companies for privacy violations, the Post said.  Cantwell\u2019s bill has similarities with California legislation, and would leave that law intact, the Post said.  Under her measure, companies would have to win a consumer\u2019s permission to share any sensitive data, which the bill defines broadly enough to include location, biometrics and brick and mortar shopping, the Post said.

(Reporting by Tom Wilson; editing by Marc Jones)","1185":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook Inc FB.O said Tuesday it has data sharing partnerships with at least four Chinese companies including Huawei, the world's third largest smartphone maker, which has come under scrutiny from U.S. intelligence agencies on security concerns.  The social media company said Huawei Technologies Co Ltd HWT.UL, computer maker Lenovo Group 0992.HK, and smartphone makers OPPO and TCL Corp 000100.SZ were among about 60 companies worldwide that received access to some user data after they signed contracts to re-create Facebook-like experiences for their users.  Members of Congress raised concerns after The New York Times reported on the practice on Sunday, saying that data of users\u2019 friends could have been accessed without their explicit consent. Facebook denied that and said the data access was to allow its users to access account features on mobile devices.  More than half of the partnerships have already been wound down, Facebook said. It said on Tuesday it would end the Huawei agreement later this week. It is ending the other three partnerships with Chinese firms as well.  Chinese telecommunications companies have come under scrutiny from U.S. intelligence officials who argue they provide an opportunity for foreign espionage and threaten critical U.S. infrastructure, something the Chinese have consistently denied.  Senator Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, who asked Facebook if Huawei was among the companies that received user data, said in a statement that the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee had raised concerns about Huawei dating back in 2012.  \u201cThe news that Facebook provided privileged access to Facebook\u2019s API to Chinese device makers like Huawei and TCL raises legitimate concerns, and I look forward to learning more about how Facebook ensured that information about their users was not sent to Chinese servers,\u201d Warner said.  API, or application program interface, essentially specifies how software components should interact.  A Facebook executive said the company had carefully managed the access it gave to the Chinese companies.  \u201cFacebook along with many other U.S. tech companies have worked with them and other Chinese manufacturers to integrate their services onto these phones,\u201d Francisco Varela, vice president of mobile partnerships for Facebook, said in a statement. \u201cFacebook\u2019s integrations with Huawei, Lenovo, OPPO and TCL were controlled from the get-go \u2014 and we approved the Facebook experiences these companies built.\u201d  Varela added that \u201cgiven the interest from Congress, we wanted to make clear that all the information from these integrations with Huawei was stored on the device, not on Huawei\u2019s servers.\u201d  Facebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks at the Viva Tech start-up and technology summit in Paris, France, May 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Charles Platiau  Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she would not comment on cooperation between companies and knew nothing of the situation.  \u201cBut we hope that the U.S. side can provide a fair, transparent, open and friendly environment for Chinese companies\u2019 investment and operational activities,\u201d Hua told reporters.  RESPONSE DEMANDED FROM ZUCKERBERG  Earlier on Tuesday, the Senate Commerce Committee demanded that Facebook\u2019s chief executive officer, Mark Zuckerberg, respond to a report that user data was shared with at least 60 device manufacturers, weeks after the social media company said it would change its practices after a political firm got access to data from millions of users.  Senators John Thune, the committee\u2019s Republican chairman, and Bill Nelson, the ranking Democrat, on Tuesday wrote to Zuckerberg after The New York Times reported that manufacturers were able to access data of users\u2019 friends even if the friends denied permission to share the information with third parties.  In April, the Federal Communications Commission proposed new rules that would bar purchases by government programs from companies that it says pose a security threat to U.S. telecoms networks, a move aimed at Huawei and ZTE Corp 000063.SZ, China\u2019s No. 2 telecommunications equipment maker. The Pentagon in May ordered retail outlets on U.S. military bases to stop selling Huawei and ZTE phones, citing potential security risks.  ZTE was not among the firms that received access to Facebook data, but it has been the subject of U.S. national security concerns.  The letter asks if Facebook audited partnerships with the device manufacturers under a 2011 consent order with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). It also asked if Zuckerberg wanted to revise his testimony before the Senate in April.  Facebook said it looks forward to addressing any questions the Commerce Committee has.  Facebook still has not answered hundreds of written questions submitted from members of Congress after Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony in April, according to congressional staff.  The data sharing mentioned in the Times story was used over the last decade by about 60 companies, including Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Blackberry Ltd BB.TO, HTC Corp 2498.TW, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS, Ime Archibong, Facebook vice president of product partnerships, wrote in a blog post on June 3.  The FTC confirmed in March that it was investigating Facebook\u2019s privacy practices.  Facebook allowed Apple and other device makers to have \u201cdeep\u201d access to users\u2019 personal data without their consent, according to the Times.  The Times said Facebook allowed companies access to the data of users\u2019 friends without their explicit consent, even after it had declared it would no longer share the information with outsiders.  Archibong said the data was only shared with device makers in order to improve Facebook users\u2019 access to the information. \u201cThese partners signed agreements that prevented people\u2019s Facebook information from being used for any other purpose than to recreate Facebook-like experiences.\u201d  Regulators and authorities in several countries have increased scrutiny of Facebook after it failed to protect the data of some 87 million users that was shared with now-defunct political data firm Cambridge Analytica.  Two Democrats on the Senate Commerce Committee, Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal, on Monday also wrote to Zuckerberg.  Archibong said the cases were \u201cvery different\u201d from the use of data by third-party developers in the Cambridge row.  New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood said on Monday the \u201cdata-sharing partnerships with other corporations\u201d is part of the ongoing investigation into the reported misuse of Facebook user data by Cambridge Analytica.

Facebook shares 6 percent and were on track for their worst day in more than three years on reports that a political consultancy that worked on President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign gained inappropriate access to data on more than 50 million users.  That sparked concerns over the collection and use of data, especially related to individuals, at other tech companies and sent the Nasdaq Composite sliding 1.5 percent and the S&P technology index down 1.8 percent in their worst day since a sell-off in early February.  Republican Senator Marco Rubio said he believed some internet companies have grown too fast to digest their responsibilities and obligations.  Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet \u2013 all part of the so-called FAANG group, along with Facebook \u2013 were down between 1 percent and 6.3 percent.  \u201cTech companies all use data one way or the other as part of their businesses.

Industrials fell 0.83 percent ahead of the Group of 20 finance ministers\u2019 meeting, where Trump\u2019s tariffs plans are likely to dominate discussions.  All the 11 major S&P sectors were lower. The CBOE Volatility index was up about 3 points at 18.68, in one of its sharpest gains since early February.  \u201cYou see money flow a lot out of these industries across the board, you\u2019ve come out of bonds a little bit too and a pop in VIX, that points to a little bit more of risk being priced in,\u201d said Cruz.  The Federal Reserve\u2019s policy meeting, over Tuesday and Wednesday, is also in focus as investors brace for a near-certain interest rate hike this week.  But the focus is on whether policymakers think economic conditions are strong enough for four hikes this year, one more than the markets expect.

The ads showed a red inverted triangle, a symbol the Nazis used to identify political prisoners, with text asking Facebook users to sign a petition against antifa, a loosely organized anti-fascist movement.  Trump and Attorney General William Barr have repeatedly singled out antifa as a major instigator of recent unrest during nationwide anti-racism protests, with little evidence.  \u201cOur policy prohibits using a banned hate group\u2019s symbol to identify political prisoners without the context that condemns or discusses the symbol,\u201d said a Facebook company spokesperson.

The image is also not included in the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s database of symbols of hate.\u201d  A spokesman for the ADL said its database was not one of historical Nazi symbols but of those \u201ccommonly used by modern extremists and white supremacists in the United States.\u201d  He also said that there have been some antifa who have used the red triangle, but that it was not a particularly common symbol used by the group.  Mark Bray, a historian at Rutgers University and the author of \u201cAntifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,\u201d said that the red triangle had been reclaimed by some leftist groups in the United Kingdom and Germany after World War Two but that he had never come across any use of it by anti-fascists in the United States.  A Reuters tally counted 88 versions of the ad using the symbol from the three Facebook pages. Ads from Trump\u2019s page had gained at least 800,000 impressions, according to Facebook\u2019s ad library.

A person familiar with the matter said the Global Allocation Fund - run by Dan Chamby, Russ Koesterich, David Clayton and Kent Hogshire - had boosted its Facebook share count. The person, who requested anonymity because BlackRock does not discuss individual stocks, declined to say specifically how many Facebook shares the fund had acquired or when during the month they were purchased.  Facebook and BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager with $6.32 trillion under management, declined to comment.  The increases in Facebook holdings were enough to make the social media company the $36.7 billion fund\u2019s sixth largest stock holding at March 30, up 10 spots from where it had been two months earlier, according to the fund\u2019s website and Thomson Reuters data. The March disclosures also do not spell out when shares were acquired or how many were bought.  Facebook had not recently been listed in the top 10 holdings, a list updated monthly. As of Jan. 31, the date of its most recent detailed filings, the Global Allocation Fund held 1.38 million Facebook shares, making it the No. 16 equity holding valued at about $258 million at that time.  Facebook shares are down more than 10 percent after the New York Times and London\u2019s Observer newspaper reported in mid-March that Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that worked on U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, gained inappropriate access to data on tens of millions of the social media company\u2019s users.  Even with the increased stake, which has not been previously reported, Facebook accounts for less than 1 percent of the BlackRock Global Allocation Fund, which holds hundreds of stocks and also invests in bonds as well as gold and other commodities. Apple Inc is listed as the fund\u2019s top stock holding, accounting for 2.24 percent of assets at the end of March.  Yet the buying represents an endorsement of Facebook by a major outside shareholder at a time when the company faces questions about whether its targeted advertising business can survive stricter regulation and calls for users to \u201c#DeleteFacebook.\u201d  Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in testimony to U.S. lawmakers last week that the company\u2019s major investments in security \u201cwill significantly impact our profitability going forward.\u201d  Overall, Facebook shares are down more than 6 percent year-to-date.

The stock is still near its cheapest ever, according to a price-to-earnings ratio based on profits Wall Street analysts expect Facebook to deliver over the coming 12 months.  For BlackRock, scooping up battered shares of Facebook could turn out to be a lucrative bet that could help boost its fund.

Facebook shares jumped 7% in extended trading after the world\u2019s biggest social network posted revenue growth of 11%, its slowest ever but still far above analysts\u2019 expectations of 3%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Ad sales, which contribute nearly all of Facebook\u2019s revenue, rose 10% to $18.3 billion in the second quarter as people under lockdown spent more time online and businesses rapidly pivoted to e-commerce. Monthly active users rose to 2.7 billion, ahead of estimates of 2.6 billion.  The results were a boon for Facebook a day after its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, took sharp jabs in a U.S. congressional hearing. Zuckerberg was among four top tech CEOs who were grilled by lawmakers on alleged abuses of market power.  On a call with investors Thursday, Facebook executives sounded notes of defiance about both demands for aggressive regulation and the July advertising boycott, which sought to pressure Facebook to take more action against hate speech.  Zuckerberg said he was \u201ctroubled\u201d by calls to \u201cgo after\u201d targeted advertising online. \u201cThis would reduce opportunities for small businesses so much that it would probably be felt at a macroeconomic level. Is that really what policymakers want in the middle of a pandemic in recession?\u201d  He also pushed back on the boycott\u2019s aims, saying there was a gulf between \u201chow the vast majority of people actually experience our services and the impression you get if you\u2019re just reading much of the commentary about Facebook.\u201d  The company appeared unscathed by the campaign, which drew the support of major advertisers including Unilever ULVR.L, Starbucks Corp SBUX.O and Coca-Cola Co KO.N.  Facebook said ad sales in the first three weeks of July grew 10% year-over-year, in line with the rate for the second quarter, and projected that ad revenue growth in the third quarter would be consistent with that, likewise faster than Wall Street estimates.  FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen placed on a keyboard in this illustration taken March 25, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  About 1,100 companies joined the boycott. Although some were among Facebook\u2019s biggest individual spenders, the bulk of Facebook\u2019s ad revenue comes from small businesses.  Zuckerberg said observers \u201cwrongly assume that our business is dependent on a few large advertisers.\u201d  \u201cMAJOR ROLE\u201d FOR INSTAGRAM  Investors were bracing for difficulties in the second quarter, which was the first to reflect the full impact of virus-related lockdowns. Facebook said in April it was seeing signs of stability for sales in the first three weeks of the quarter after a plunge in March.  Debra Aho Williamson, principal analyst at eMarketer, said she believed Facebook unit Instagram played a \u201cmajor role\u201d in helping the company withstand the effects of the pandemic.  \u201cAlthough Facebook doesn\u2019t release details about Instagram\u2019s revenue, we believe that Instagram has been a rapidly growing contributor to the company\u2019s total revenue, and that its success is helping to buoy Facebook as a whole,\u201d she said.  The company fared better than Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, the world's biggest seller of online ads, which beat expectations but not by a fantastic amount. Alphabet's quarterly sales fell for the first time in its 16 years as a public company.  Facebook tempered expectations for later in the year, saying privacy changes being introduced by mobile device makers like Apple APPL.O could hinder the data sharing it uses to serve personalized ads.  Such \u201caggressive platform policies\u201d could \u201ccut a lifeline\u201d for small businesses, Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, David Wehner, cautioned.  Total costs and expenses increased 4% to $12.7 billion in the second quarter, compared with the $12.5 billion analysts had forecast. The company was still recruiting aggressively, adding 4,200 new hires in the quarter, its most on record.  Net income came in at $5.2 billion, or $1.80 per share, in the three months ended June 30. A year earlier it earned $2.6 billion, reflecting a $2 billion charge related to a privacy settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.  Analysts had expected a profit of $1.39 per share.","1193":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's YouTube, Facebook Inc FB.O and Twitter Inc TWTR.N warned on Monday that more videos and other content could be erroneously removed for policy violations, as the companies empty offices and rely on automated takedown software during the coronavirus pandemic.  In a blog post, Google said that to reduce the need for people to come into offices, YouTube and other business divisions are temporarily relying more on artificial intelligence and automated tools to find problematic content.  Such software is not always as accurate as humans, which leads to errors, it added, however. And \u201cturnaround times for appeals against these decisions may be slower,\u201d it said.  Facebook followed suit, saying it would work with contract vendors this week to send home all content reviewers home indefinitely, with pay.  The social media company drew public criticism last week for asking policy enforcers to continue coming to work, as it lacks secure technology to conduct moderation remotely.  Facebook also said the decision to rely more on automated tools, which learn to identify offensive material by analyzing digital clues for aspects common to previous takedowns, has limitations.  \u201cWe may see some longer response times and make more mistakes as a result,\u201d it said.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Twitter said it too would step up use of similar automation, but would not ban users based solely on automated enforcement, because of accuracy concerns.  The three Silicon Valley internet services giants, like many companies worldwide, have asked employees and contractors to work from home if possible, to slow the fast-spreading respiratory disease. Mass gatherings for sports, cultural and religious events have been canceled globally.  Google said human review of automated policy decisions also would be slower for other products and phone support would be limited.  Its content rules cover submissions such as campaigns on its ad network, apps uploaded to the Google Play store and business reviews posted to Google Maps.  \u201cSome users, advertisers, developers and publishers may experience delays in some support response times for non-critical services, which will now be supported primarily through our chat, email, and self-service channels,\u201d Google said.

WhatsApp said in a statement it was working to address misinformation and remains available to answer any questions. \u201cWe wish to reinforce that this update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook,\u201d it said.  California-based Facebook invested $5.7 billion last year in the digital unit of Indian conglomerate Reliance with a huge part of that aimed at drawing in tens of millions of traditional shop owners to use digital payments via WhatsApp.  With 400 million users in India, WhatsApp has big plans for the country\u2019s growing digital payments space, including selling health insurance via partners.  Those aspirations could take a hit if Indians switch to rival messengers such as Signal and Telegram, downloads of which have surged after WhatsApp said on Jan. 4 it could share limited user data with Facebook and its group firms.  It is of \u201cgreat concern\u201d that Indian users have not been given the choice to opt out of this data sharing with Facebook companies and they are being given less choice compared to the app\u2019s European users, the tech ministry letter said.  \u201cThis differential and discriminatory treatment of Indian and European users is attracting serious criticism and betrays a lack of respect for the rights and interest of Indian citizens who form a substantial portion of WhatsApp\u2019s user base,\u201d it said.  The ministry asked WhatsApp to respond to 14 questions including on the categories of user data it collected, whether it profiled customers based on usage and cross-border data flows.  The company said last week it would delay the new policy launch to May from February, after facing criticism from users in India and elsewhere to the new terms.  WhatsApp has launched a media advertising campaign in India to calm worried users. The update to the privacy policy has also resulted in two legal petitions in Indian courts.","1196":"FILE PHOTO: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing regarding the company\u2019s use and protection of user data on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., April 11, 2018.

About 83 percent of the compensation represented security-related expenses, while most of the rest were tied to Zuckerberg\u2019s personal usage of private aircraft.  Zuckerberg spent much of last year traveling after he pledged to visit all the U.S. states that he had not previously been to.  His security expenses climbed to $7.3 million in 2017 from $4.9 million a year earlier.  Menlo Park, California-based Facebook paid to buy, install and maintain security measures for Zuckerberg\u2019s personal residences, which include properties in San Francisco and Palo Alto, the filing showed.

The volatile give-and-take during the week and quarter would seem to set the table for tense months ahead as buy-the-dip bulls look for corporate earnings to validate the market\u2019s current levels and short-selling bears work to expose investors\u2019 complacency.  Yet David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co\u2019s funds division, said he is optimistic that markets have clarified the effects of a large U.S. tax cut and the prospect for higher interest rates, factors he says challenged markets during the first quarter.  \u201cIt\u2019s not that the uncertainties have gone away on higher rates or lower taxes, but I think we\u2019ve grown accustomed to them, and that should lay a foundation for investors to put more money to work,\u201d he said.

FILE PHOTO: A 3D printed Whatsapp logo is placed on the keyboard in this illustration taken April 12, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The Competition Commission of India (CCI) is reviewing a complaint filed in mid-March alleging that WhatsApp was bundling its digital payment facility within its messaging app, allowing it to abuse its market position and penetrate India\u2019s booming digital payments market, the sources said.  WhatsApp and Facebook did not immediately respond to repeated requests for comment. The CCI also did not respond.  Two of the sources told Reuters the complainant in the case was a lawyer, but declined to divulge the identity of the person. Reuters could not independently ascertain who filed the case.  The complaint, which has previously not been reported, comes at a critical time for WhatsApp, which is aggressively working to fully launch its payments platform in India, where it has been beta testing it with 1 million users since 2018.  Lack of regulatory clearances have meant WhatsApp has struggled to offer the service to its around 400 million users in India, its biggest market worldwide.  The CCI can order its investigations arm to conduct a wider probe into the allegations, or throw out the case if it finds no merit in it.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  \u201cThe case is in initial stages .. senior members of CCI are reviewing it but a final decision hasn\u2019t been reached,\u201d said the first of the three sources, all of whom declined to be identified as the case details were private.  The antitrust complaint alleges that WhatsApp\u2019s large user base meant it was dominant in the messaging app market, and the company was forcing its payments feature on to its existing users.  The two products - WhatsApp\u2019s messenger service and its payments feature - are bundled, which could harm competition and violate the country\u2019s antitrust laws, the second source said while detailing the allegations.  WhatsApp\u2019s payment service will allow users to do inter-bank fund transfers from within the messaging app. It will compete with payment apps of Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Softbank-backed Paytm, which already have tens of millions of users across India.  While the antitrust case has been filed against both Facebook and WhatsApp, the complainant has urged the watchdog to investigate only WhatsApp, the second source said.  It was possible WhatsApp could escape a wider investigation as the extent of any market abuse will be clearer only when it fully launches the service, the source added.  The antitrust complaint is the latest setback for WhatsApp in India.  An Indian legal think-tank last month filed a case in the Supreme Court saying WhatsApp should not be allowed to expand its payments service as it was violating data storage rules.  WhatsApp told the court it will comply with necessary laws before it moves ahead, according to a May 13 court order that also asked Indian regulators to submit its views on the case.  In April, Facebook said it will spend $5.7 billion to buy a 9.99% stake in India\u2019s Reliance Industries\u2019 digital arm, as it looks to roll out services for grocers and small businesses by capitalizing on WhatsApp\u2019s extensive reach.","1201":"FILE PHOTO: Stickers bearing the Facebook logo are pictured at Facebook Inc's F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S., April 30, 2019.

The videos accuse Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha\u2019s government of lack of transparency in allowing Siam Bioscience, which is owned by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, to supply most doses despite a lack of vaccine experience.  Critics say former junta leader Prayuth rigged a vote in a 2019 election to retain power - a charge he denies - and have broken a national taboo by increasingly criticising the monarchy.  SUBSIDY  Siam Bioscience received a 600 million baht ($20 million) subsidy to develop capacity to manufacture AstraZeneca vaccines domestically and across Southeast Asia.  The court did not comment when contacted by Reuters.  Thanathorn\u2019s movement said it had not received the ruling. \u201cWe continue to stress that the content is not false or a threat to national security,\u201d tweeted Pannika Wanich, a prominent Progressive Movement member.  \u201cWe hope YouTube and Facebook will stand by the rights and freedom of expression.\u201d  Thanathorn was banned from politics for 10 years after a court dissolved his previous Future Forward Party last year over loans deemed illegal. He denied the charges.  Now the government has lodged a case against him over the video, accusing him of insulting royalty, a charge punishable by up to 15 years\u2019 prison.  The government says Siam Bioscience manufacturing is on track to deliver a first batch of 61 million doses to the public by June.  There was no immediate comment from Thanathorn or Siam Bioscience on the court ruling. The palace traditionally does not comment on political disputes.  Relatively unscathed by COVID-19, Thailand on Sunday reported 829 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total to 18,782 cases and 77 fatalities since the outbreak started last January.

(Reporting by Amy Caren Daniel in Bengaluru Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)","1208":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc on Wednesday blew past Wall Street profit estimates in the first quarter and set aside $3 billion to cover a settlement with U.S. regulators, calming investors who had worried about the outcome of a months-long federal probe.  Shares of the world\u2019s biggest online social network jumped more than 10 percent to $200.50 in after-hours trade. They have now regained much of the ground lost last year amid slowing growth and costs associated with the company\u2019s privacy scandals.  The settlement accrual, which Facebook set at $3 billion but said could rise as high as $5 billion, cut the company\u2019s net income in the first quarter to $2.43 billion, or 85 cents per share.  Excluding the charge, Facebook would have earned $1.89 a share, up from $1.69 in the year-ago quarter and easily beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $1.63 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Total first-quarter revenue rose 26 percent to $15.1 billion from $12.0 billion last year, again beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $15.0 billion.  \u201cThis is a strong report suggesting that advertisers still see value in Facebook\u2019s platform, as they did before the controversies and scandals erupted,\u201d said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com.  Monthly and daily users of the main Facebook app were both up 8 percent compared to last year, to 2.4 billion and 1.6 billion, respectively, in line with forecasts.  Total expenses in the first quarter were $11.8 billion, including the settlement accrual, up 80 percent compared with a year ago as the company hired content moderators and invested in new security controls to make its social networks safer.  Executives said in a conference call with investors that they expected expenses to grow 47 to 55 percent this year, updating their earlier forecast of an increase of 40 to 50 percent.

REUTERS\/Eric Gaillard  The first-quarter operating margin fell to 22 percent from 46 percent a year ago, but would have been a comfortable 42 percent without the one-time expense.  BIGGEST PENALTY  The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has been investigating revelations that Facebook inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million of its users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The probe has focused on whether the sharing of data and other disputes violated a 2011 agreement with the FTC to safeguard user privacy.  A settlement of between $3 billion and $5 billion would be the largest civil penalty ever paid to the agency, said David Vladeck, a former FTC official who is now a professor at Georgetown Law School.  \u201cEveryone expected there would be a substantial civil penalty in this case,\u201d said Vladeck. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that Facebook is going to have to settle this matter. Investors want this behind them.\u201d  Even once the FTC probe is resolved, other challenges remain. The number of Facebook users barely budged in the United States, Canada and Europe, indicating saturation in the company\u2019s most lucrative markets.  Its largest and fastest-growing user base is now in Asia, where monthly active users jumped 12.4 percent from last year. The region represents nearly half of all Facebook users, but brought in less than a fifth of the company\u2019s revenue.  That shift in geography, along with slow advertiser adoption of new services like Stories, resulted in a 4 percent decline in the average price per ad in the first quarter.  Facebook plans to shift focus toward private communications, integrating its messaging services across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, but has not yet articulated how it will adapt its advertising-driven business model.  The company launched a sales system last month that enables users to purchase products directly on Instagram and is testing a WhatsApp payments system in India that it plans to roll out to other countries, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said.  \u201cIn countries where we already are the leading platform there will be more ability to work on things like payments in the near term and build in additional ways that people want to interact privately,\u201d he said. But the services would not be a \u201cmajor driver\u201d of Facebook\u2019s business for at least a couple of years, he said.  Facebook also faces the prospect of action by lawmakers, with some calling for federal privacy regulation and anti-trust action to break up big tech companies.  Representative David Cicilline, who chairs the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee\u2019s subcommittee on antitrust issues, said on Twitter that Facebook was \u201ca repeat offender\u201d and called for an FTC response \u201cstrong enough to prevent future violations.\u201d  \u201cA fine in the low billions of dollars would amount to a slap on the wrist for Facebook. Tonight, we learned that\u2019s how Wall Street sees it too - as a slap on the wrist. If the FTC won\u2019t act, Congress has to,\u201d he said.","1209":"FILE PHOTO: A 3D printed Facebook logo is placed between small toy people figures in front of a keyboard in this illustration taken April 12, 2020.

The NYT report also said Facebook gave companies like Netflix NFLX.O and Spotify SPOT.N the ability to read users' private messages and permitted Amazon AMZN.O to obtain users' names and contact information through their friends.  \u201cAt no time did we access people\u2019s private messages on Facebook or ask for the ability to do so,\u201d a Netflix spokesperson said in response to the story.  Netflix had launched a feature in 2014 that enabled members to recommend TV shows and movies to their Facebook friends via Messenger or Netflix. The spokesperson said Netflix shut the feature in 2015 as it was not popular.  Facebook said the access to these companies, known as integration partners, was aimed at helping users access their Facebook accounts or specific features on devices and platforms built by other companies like Apple AAPL.O, Amazon, Blackberry BB.TO and Yahoo.  The feature could also help users see recommendations from their Facebook friends on other popular apps and websites like Netflix and Spotify.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Facebook said the users needed to sign in with their Facebook account to use these features offered by the likes of Apple and Amazon.  The social network said it shut down nearly all of these partnerships over the past several months, except those with Apple and Amazon, which people continue to find useful and which are covered by active contracts.

Four people died on Capitol grounds in the chaos, including a woman who was shot and killed inside the building.  The president and his allies for months have amplified unsubstantiated claims of election fraud, driving the organizing for the day\u2019s demonstration.

He also blamed Vice President Mike Pence for lacking \u201ccourage\u201d to pursue the claims of election fraud.  Twitter locked Trump\u2019s account until 12 hours after he deletes those tweets and a video in which he alleged the presidential election was fraudulent and urged protesters to go home.

Twitter and Facebook acted against major QAnon accounts last year, but by the time they did, influencers had been able to drive their followers to new platforms, such as Parler, and closed channels, like those on Telegram, where their conduct was harder to track.

The company confirmed to Reuters on Monday that some employees had criticized its policy in an internal letter.

Facebook reported its third straight rise in quarterly sales growth on Wednesday, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate.

Brad Parscale, who is running Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, described Twitter\u2019s move as an \u201cattempt to silence conservatives\u201d and \u201ca very dumb decision\u201d for the company\u2019s shareholders.  \u201cWill Twitter also be stopping ads from biased liberal media outlets who will now run unchecked as they buy obvious political content meant to attack Republicans,\u201d Parscale said in a statement. \u201cThis is yet another attempt to silence conservatives, since Twitter knows President Trump has the most sophisticated online program ever known.\u201d  A Twitter spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

FILE PHOTO: Silhouettes of laptop users are seen next to a screen projection of Facebook logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  Under the agreement, Facebook will create a new advertising portal for ads linked to housing, employment and credit ads that will limit targeting options for those ads across all of its services, including Instagram and Messenger, the rights groups said in a joint statement.  Advertisers on the portal, which will be separate from the system used to advertise other sets of services, will not be able to target ads by age, gender, cultural affinity or zip code, the statement said.  They will also be required to use a minimum geographic radius for location-based targeting to prevent the exclusion of certain communities.  In addition, the company pledged to build a tool allowing users to search all current housing ads listed in the United States, regardless of whether the ads were directed at them.  \u201cThere is a long history of discrimination in the areas of housing, employment and credit, and this harmful behavior should not happen through Facebook ads,\u201d Facebook\u2019s Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said in a separate statement.  Facebook, the world\u2019s largest social network with 2.7 billion users and nearly $56 billion in annual revenue, has been on the defensive over its advertising practices, while also fending off privacy scandals and disclosures that Russia used its platform to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  Complaints over ads-based discrimination have dogged the company since 2016, when news organization ProPublica reported that advertisers could target ads on Facebook based on people\u2019s self-reported jobs, even if the job was \u201cJew hater.\u201d  ProPublica later reported that it was able to buy discriminatory housing ads and slip them past Facebook\u2019s review process, despite the company\u2019s claims it was blocking such ads.  Since then, Facebook has faced sustained legal pressure over the issue from the National Fair Housing Alliance, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Communications Workers of America, among other groups and individuals.  In five separate lawsuits, the groups alleged the company\u2019s audience selection tools enabled advertisers to exclude specific demographics from seeing job postings and other opportunities.  Facebook\u2019s settings \u201callowed advertisers to create ads that excluded people of color or families with children,\u201d said Sandra Tamez, head of the Fair Housing Council of Greater San Antonio, which was part of Tuesday\u2019s settlement.  Under U.S. law, including the federal Fair Housing Act, it is illegal to publish certain types of ads if they indicate a preference based on race, religion, sex or other specified classifications.  Facebook last year reached a similar settlement with Washington state to end discriminatory ad targeting. It said at the time that it had already removed thousands of categories of potentially sensitive personal attributes from its exclusion ad targeting tools.  Wit the new settlement, Facebook has committed to creating its ads portal by Sept. 30 and to implementing other changes by the end of the year.","1216":"Shared hundreds of times on Facebook, posts claim: \u201cEvery time a hospital admits, discharges, or loses a patient to Covid-19, they are compensated 15% more according to the CARES ACT, SEC 4409\u201d. The posts also say that New York City hospitals are \u201cinflating all of their #coronavirus numbers\u201d to take advantage of this section of the act. The claims made in these posts are partly false.  Reuters Fact Check. REUTERS\/Axel Schmidt  Examples of the post can be seen here and here .  It is true that a section of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (or the CARES Act) calls for higher compensation from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for the care of patients with a primary or secondary diagnosis of COVID-19. Contrary to what the posts claim, however, the measure is found in Section 3710, not 4409, and the increase is 20%, not 15%. It appears that the content\u2019s author confused the version of the bill that went through the Senate on March 21 ( here ) with the final House version ( here ), which became public law on March 27.  Section 3710 of the CARES Act calls for the following: \u201cFor discharges occurring during the emergency period described in section 1135(g)(1)(B), in the case of a discharge of an individual diagnosed with COVID\u201319, the Secretary (of Health and Human Services) shall increase the weighting factor that would otherwise apply to the diagnosis-related group to which the discharge is assigned by 20 percent.\u201d  The \u201cemergency period\u201d refers to the length of time that the United States will remain in the national emergency that was declared by President Donald Trump on March 13 ( here ).  The terms \u201cweighting factor\u201d and \u201cdiagnosis-related group\u201d are part of Medicare\u2019s Prospective Payment System. Since 1983, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has used the system to put medical and surgical services into different categories known as diagnosis-related groups. According to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, the system \u201ccreates a rate of payment based on the \u201caverage\u201d cost to deliver care (bundled services) to a patient with a particular disease\u201d (See page 5, here ). The CMS gives each diagnosis-related group a unique weight, which \u201creflects the average level of resources for an average Medicare patient\u201d in that group, \u201crelative to the average level of resources for all Medicare patients\u201d (See page 6). For the purposes of the payment system, in-hospital deaths are considered discharges.  The posts\u2019 claim that the payment increase applies \u201cevery time a hospital admits, discharges, or loses a patient to Covid-19\u201d is false. The 20% weighted factor increase applies only to Medicare patients and those without health insurance. It does not apply to patients with other forms of health insurance, like Medicaid or private insurance.  Only about 16% of New York City\u2019s population is enrolled in Medicare for hospital and medical insurance ( see zip file here ; here )  As for discharges of patients without insurance, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) says here , \u201cEvery health care provider who has provided treatment for uninsured COVID-19 patients on or after February 4, 2020, can request claims reimbursement through the program and will be reimbursed at Medicare rates, subject to available funding.\u201d According to estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, 9.6% of New York City residents under the age of 65 are uninsured ( here ).  The weight determines the amount CMS reimburses the hospital for the patient\u2019s care. Conditions that are more expensive to manage have higher weights. For example, a heart transplant with a major complication or comorbidity has a weight of 26.4106 while an uncomplicated peptic ulcer without any major complication or comorbidity has a weight of 0.8553 (see Table 5 here ).  Under Section 3710 of the CARES Act, the diagnosis-related group weight for pulmonary edema (excess fluid in the lungs) and respiratory failure would increase by 20% from 1.2157 (See Table 5 here ) to 1.4588 if the patient\u2019s condition is a complication of COVID-19. The weight for simple pneumonia & pleurisy (inflammation of the lung tissue) with major complication or comorbidity would go up by 20% from 1.3335 to 1.6002, according to Reuters calculations.  Health economist Sherry Glied, dean of New York University\u2019s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and former Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at the Department of Health and Human Services ( here ) explained to Reuters: \u201cCOVID-related pneumonia costs more to treat than regular pneumonia because it\u2019s so infectious.\u201d  The social media posts did not cite any evidence to support the allegation that New York hospitals are inflating their COVID-19 case numbers to bring in more money.

Data portability - considered a potential remedy for large technology companies whose control of social media material makes it harder for smaller rivals to get started - has become a key part of the antitrust debate in the United States and Europe.  In April, Facebook allowed users in the United States and Canada to transfer photos and videos to Aphabet-owned Google Photos for the first time - a move that is likely to help the company respond to U.S. regulators and lawmakers, who are investigating its competitive practices and allegations it has stifled competition.  \u201cThe FTC often issues reports following these workshops ... I think their recommendations should include dedicated portability legislation,\u201d Bijan Madhani, privacy and public policy manager at Facebook told Reuters.  Facebook supports a portability bill already doing the rounds in Congress called the Access Act from Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal and Mark Warner, and Republican senator Josh Hawley. It would require large tech platforms to let their users easily move their data to other services.  The bill is a good first step, Madhani said. Facebook has engaged with the lawmakers on it and will continue working with them, he added.  Facebook is also seeking regulatory guidance, in the form of an independent body or regulator, in answering policy questions and helping them address liability issues tied to portability, Madhani said.  The social media platform is also pressing for more clarity on what kinds of data should be portable and who is responsible for protecting such information as it moves to different services, he added.  Data portability is a requirement under Europe\u2019s privacy law called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California\u2019s privacy law called the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).  Facebook developed its data portability tool as a member of the Data Transfer Project - which was formed to allow web users to easily move their data between online service providers whenever they want - and counts Facebook, Google, Microsoft , Twitter and Apple among its contributors.

But seafood has been good to him.  Hawking dried shrimp, squid and fish in nightly Facebook FB.O livestreams, Anurak, who is quick with a joke and adept at interacting with customers, can draw up to 300,000 viewers at a time.  He\u2019s backed by a team who help respond to orders, answer questions on Facebook Messenger, monitor payments to his bank account and shout out tag lines off camera for comedic effect.  The formula works so well, Anurak says he made 26 million baht ($829,000) in sales in March alone.  \u201cFacebook and Instagram give people an opportunity. If you do it right with good content, in just seven months you can make millions,\u201d he told Reuters from the seaside village of Satun.  His success is emblematic of booming social media commerce in Thailand where entrepreneurs sell products directly to customers via Facebook, Instagram and messaging apps like Japan's Line Corp 3938.T.  Propelled by upgrades to mobile banking apps, sales via social media in Thailand more than doubled to 334.2 billion baht ($10.9 billion) in 2017, according to the latest report from the country\u2019s Electronic Transaction Development Agency.  Moreover, those sales accounted for 44% of e-commerce in Southeast Asia\u2019s second-biggest economy, jumping from 21% a year earlier. Since then, banks have dropped transfer fees, likely driving the market further.  The popularity of so-called social commerce in Thailand owes much to the relatively late arrival of big e-commerce firms, cultural shopping preferences and the wide use of Facebook FB.O and Instagram. Some 38 million people or 57% of the population access Facebook every day, according to the U.S. firm.  Slideshow ( 9 images )  Its growth also highlights the global business opportunities for Facebook and its Instagram unit.  \u201cSocial commerce is a market to monitor because Facebook has moved more sharply in a commerce direction recently with the launch of many commerce friendly features,\u201d said Alessandro Psicini, co-founder of Crea which advises brands that want to boost their social media sales in Thailand.  Facebook said this month it wanted to expand into payments and launch its own coin. Instagram in March introduced a checkout button which allows users to shop without leaving the app, though that function is currently limited to a small number of brands and U.S. consumers.  Facebook and Instagram declined to comment on how they plan to make the most of social commerce opportunities.  CUSTOMERS FIRST  Within Asia, only Indonesia rivals Thailand in social commerce. There it accounts for about 40% of e-commerce but is worth a smaller $3 billion, says consulting firm McKinsey & Company. The market is less developed as many Indonesians do not have bank accounts and due to the challenges of delivering goods across the country\u2019s archipelago.  In other parts of Asia, shopping on big e-commerce platforms like China's Alibaba BABA.N, Amazon.com's AMZN.O Japan unit or Walmart's WMT.N Indian unit Flipkart is the norm, although selling via social media is on the rise in some countries.  Livestreaming by merchants has gained in popularity in China while in India, social commerce companies have emerged over the past year. Satish Meena, senior analyst at Forrester Research, says the firm\u2019s preliminary estimates put India\u2019s annual social selling revenue at $100-$150 million.  Slideshow ( 9 images )  Completing a sale via social media can be cumbersome.  In Thailand, customers find products on Facebook or Instagram, while chats and payments usually take place on different apps. But for many Thais, the appeal of social media shopping is the direct communication with merchants.  Chonticha Srisawang, 35, who has her own brand of fake eyelashes and over 76,000 followers on her Instagram, prang_bohktoh, says customers became comfortable placing orders after she took the time to answer queries on chat app Line.  \u201cThe Thai market is very customer-centric,\u201d said Vilaiporn Taweelappontong, partner at PwC Thailand, adding that Thai shoppers love to browse and share, which favours social media over big online shopping malls.  \u201cMerchants do everything to ensure customers have a good experience. In the U.S and Europe there is more standardization and there are fewer choices because the emphasis is on the back-end and things moving faster.\u201d  The two biggest online malls in Thailand are now seeeking to win over social media merchants - who industry experts estimate number more than a hundred thousand. Both added livestreaming services last year.  Alibaba's BABA.N Lazada, which launched in Thailand in 2012, also started an invitation-only program in August to bring social media sellers with a broad customer base onto its site. Around 300 merchants have since joined.  Sea Ltd SE.N in March raised $1.5 billion, part of which will go toward educating merchants on how to best use its Shopee platform, which debuted in Thailand in 2015.  Some merchants, however, are not convinced.  Patchararak Thanasintrakul, who sells swimwear on Instagram account Swimsaic, is hesitant due to concerns about copycats and potential pressure to discount.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been thinking about it. Lazada approached us, but we worry about brand image. Lazada likes to support discounts, but our brand has never done discounts,\u201d she said.  A Lazada spokeswoman said the company does not compel its merchants to discount.","1220":"SAN FRANCISCO, March 20 (Reuters) - State attorneys general for Massachusetts and New York sent a letter to Facebook Inc on Tuesday demanding information about personal data that ended up in the hands of analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, a person familiar with the matter said.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Brandon Dail, a user interface engineer in Seattle, wrote on Twitter that he was dismissed for publicly scolding a colleague who had refused to include a statement of support for the Black Lives Matter movement on developer documents he was publishing.  Dail sent the tweet a day after joining dozens of employees, including the six other engineers on his team, in abandoning their desks and tweeting objections to Zuckerberg\u2019s handling of Trump\u2019s posts in a rare protest at the social media company.  \u201cIntentionally not making a statement is already political,\u201d Dail wrote in the tweet, sent on June 2. He said on Friday that he stood by what he wrote.  Facebook confirmed Dail\u2019s characterization of his dismissal, but declined to provide additional information. The company said during the walkout that participating employees would not face retaliation.  Dail did not respond to a request for comment.  Trump\u2019s posts which prompted the staff outcry included the racially charged phrase \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d in reference to demonstrations against racism and police brutality held after the May 25 killing of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis.  Twitter affixed a warning label to the same post, saying it glorified violence. Facebook opted to leave the post untouched.  Zuckerberg defended his decision at a tense all-hands meeting with employees that week. During the meeting, Dail tweeted that it was \u201ccrystal clear today that leadership refuses to stand with us.\u201d  Dail again voiced objections this week after both Facebook and Twitter declined to take action against a Trump post that contained an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory about Martin Gugino, a 75-year-old protester who was critically injured by police in Buffalo, New York.  \u201cTrump\u2019s attack on Martin Gugino is despicable and a clear violation [of] Facebook\u2019s anti-harassment rules. It\u2019s again extremely disappointing that we (and Twitter) haven\u2019t removed it,\u201d he said.  Internal dissent is often encouraged at Silicon Valley tech giants, but the companies have been accused of penalizing workers who organise and air complaints publicly.  Alphabet\u2019s Google fired at least five workplace activists late last year, while Amazon dismissed critics of its warehouse conditions during the coronavirus pandemic.  Both companies denied firing employees for speaking out.","1222":"FILE PHOTO: A Facebook sign at the National Exhibition and Convention Center in Shanghai, China November 5, 2018.

Such an increase would make the U.S. company one of the largest multinational employers in Ireland next to the likes of Google and Apple, which each employ over 6,000 people around the country.

He did not say how many had been sold since Portal\u2019s launch late last year in the United States, or what the new devices were.  The launch came amid concerns over Facebook\u2019s privacy and content moderation practices that have led some people to abandon the service and the company to warn of thinning profits.  The release of new video chat devices fits into Facebook\u2019s focus toward private messaging by encryption of conversations on more of its messaging services.  Facebook is one of the biggest global players in private messaging with its WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, each used by more than 1 billion people. Only WhatsApp fully secures message content from all outsiders, including Facebook itself.  Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said in March that within a few years, direct messaging would dwarf discussion on the traditional, open platform of Facebook\u2019s news feed, where public posts can go viral across the world.  Bosworth said in the interview on Monday the devices did not have the ability to record things and were only for calls.  \u201cThere was a lot of conversation around us launching Portal. But it\u2019s about what Facebook is at its core. It\u2019s entirely about private conversation,\u201d Bosworth said.","1226":"Slideshow ( 3 images )  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook Inc\u2019s plans to create a global cryptocurrency will face scrutiny from the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on July 16, the latest sign that policymakers around the globe are casting a wary eye on the project.  The hearing will explore the project, dubbed Libra, as well as any data privacy considerations it may raise, the committee said on Wednesday. No witnesses have been announced yet, according to a committee spokesperson.  David Marcus, who oversees Facebook\u2019s blockchain efforts, is expected to testify, according to a source in Washington familiar with the matter.  The announcement comes one day after the social media giant unveiled plans to launch a global cryptocurrency, which immediately attracted attention from regulators across the globe, and skepticism from Washington.  Representative Maxine Waters, the Democrat who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said Tuesday she planned to similarly call Facebook to testify, and asked the company to halt the project while policymakers studied it.  In May, the leaders of the Senate Banking Committee wrote to Facebook seeking information on rumors of its cryptocurrency project, and how it would protect consumer information.  On Tuesday, a Facebook representative said the company looked forward to answering lawmaker questions. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the July 16 hearing.  Facebook hopes to launch the Libra in the first half of 2020. They hope it will not only power transactions between established consumers and businesses globally, but offer unbanked consumers access to financial services for the first time.  Before Tuesday\u2019s announcement, Facebook was already facing significant backlash over mishandling user data and not doing enough to prevent Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Klain, 59, served as Biden\u2019s chief of staff when he was vice president under President Barack Obama and had been widely expected to be named to the post.  He also has experience battling a public health crisis, as he worked as Obama\u2019s \u201cEbola Czar\u201d in 2014 during an outbreak of that virus in Africa. A fierce critic of Trump\u2019s handling of the  coronavirus pandemic, Klain is expected to be a key figure in Biden\u2019s response to the health crisis.  As Biden moved toward assuming office, Trump\u2019s campaign filed a federal lawsuit in Michigan as it continued its long-shot legal strategy of trying to overturn the election results in key states.  All week, Biden has paid little public attention to Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud, instead focusing on transition issues as he prepares to be sworn in on Jan. 20.  Biden clinched victory last Saturday as he won a series of battleground states to exceed the 270 electoral votes needed in the state-by-state Electoral College that determines who wins the presidency. Biden also was winning the national popular vote by more than 5 million ballots with a few states still counting votes.  Trump has refused to concede, and his administration has resisted cooperating with transition efforts.  Democrats and other critics have accused Trump of aiming to undermine public trust in the U.S. electoral system and delegitimize Biden\u2019s victory through unproven and anecdotal claims of voter fraud as Trump, the first U.S. president to lose a re-election bid since 1992, desperately tries to cling to power.  In Klain, Biden brings in a trusted and experienced operative who also served as Vice President Al Gore\u2019s top aide during Bill Clinton\u2019s administration. He served as an outside adviser to Biden during the campaign and the two have a relationship dating back to Biden\u2019s years as a U.S. senator from Delaware.  As Biden\u2019s chief of staff during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, Klain helped oversee the implementation of the $787 billion Recovery Act that boosted the cratering economy.  In 2014, he earned plaudits from public health experts as the government\u2019s Ebola response coordinator.  \u201cRon has been invaluable to me over the many years that we have worked together, including as we rescued the American economy from one of the worst downturns in our history in 2009 and later overcame a daunting public health emergency in 2014,\u201d Biden said in a statement.

Slideshow ( 8 images )  The lawsuit made allegations of voting misconduct, with the focus on the Democratic stronghold of Wayne County, which includes Detroit. Jake Rollow, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of State, said the Trump campaign was promoting false claims to erode public confidence in the election.  \u201cIt does not change the truth: Michigan\u2019s elections were conducted fairly, securely, transparently, and the results are an accurate reflection of the will of the people,\u201d Rollow said in a statement.  Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced a hand recount of all ballots cast in the state\u2019s 159 counties. He said it was expected to begin this week and would be finished in time to certify the results by a Nov. 20 deadline.  Biden became the election winner even without Georgia factored in. He held a lead of just over 14,000 votes, or 0.3 percentage point, in Georgia, a Southern state that Democrats have not carried in a presidential election since 1992.  Judges have tossed out several Trump lawsuits, and legal experts say the litigation has scant chance of changing the outcome.  The lawsuits are part of a broader effort to find evidence to back up Trump\u2019s fraud allegations and forge a case that could end up at the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority including three justices appointed by him.  One Republican strategist with ties to the White House said the legal maneuvers and push for recounts were aimed at coming up with support for Trump\u2019s claims.  The strategist, like many others close to the effort, acknowledged the Trump campaign faced an uphill struggle.  \u201cThey\u2019re looking at throwing up a hundred Hail Marys,\u201d he said, using a football term referring to a desperation pass at the end of a game.","1231":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook FB.O on Tuesday said it would not take down politicians' posts that violate its community standards and will not label them as rival Twitter has promised, saying it should not be the arbiter of acceptable speech in the political arena.

Moscow has denied the claims.  Facebook will take down posts if a politician\u2019s content has the potential to incite violence or pose a safety risk that outweighs the public interest value. And political advertisements must still meet Facebook\u2019s rules.  The kinds of posts from politicians that could be kept up might include cruel or insensitive comments or graphic content.  Facebook\u2019s head of global affairs Nick Clegg announced the stance in a speech in Washington D.C. on the social media giant\u2019s preparations for the U.S. presidential election in November 2020.  \u201cWould it be acceptable to society at large to have a private company in effect become a self-appointed referee for everything that politicians say?\u201d Clegg asked. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it would be.\u201d  The comments follow Twitter's TWTR.N announcement in June that it would identify and de-emphasize tweets that broke its rules but were posted by important sources, such as politicians and government officials.  If flagged, a notice would cover the offending tweet and require a user to click on a link to view it.  A Facebook spokeswoman told Reuters that newsworthy content from politicians on Facebook would not be labeled to show it had violated the rules.  Clegg, who was previously Britain\u2019s deputy prime minister, also said Facebook did not submit original content from politicians to its independent fact-checkers. It will only demote and label previously debunked content that is shared by politicians.  Facebook\u2019s third-party fact-checking program, which is used to label and de-emphasize false content, has been a centerpiece of its fight against disinformation.  A Facebook spokeswoman said the global policy would apply to politicians at the executive, national and regional levels, including candidates for office.  Facebook\u2019s stance on politicians\u2019 content builds on its policy, in place since 2016, to leave up content whose public interest it considers to outweigh the risk of harm.","1232":"LONDON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc on Thursday said it had dismantled three networks of fake accounts which could be used by Russia\u2019s intelligence services to leak hacked documents as part of efforts to disrupt the upcoming U.S. election.  The company said the accounts, which it suspended for using fake identities and other types of \u201ccoordinated inauthentic behaviour\u201d, were linked to Russian intelligence and people associated with a St Petersburg-based organisation accused by U.S. officials of working to sway the 2016 presidential vote.  Russia has repeatedly denied allegations of election meddling and says it does not interfere in the domestic politics of other countries.  Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy, said there was no immediate evidence that hacked documents were about to be leaked, but by suspending the accounts Facebook hoped to prevent them being used in any subsequent operation.  \u201cOur team watches for the threats and trends that we need to be ready for and one that we are very aware of ... is a hack-and-leak operation, particularly in the next 6-8 weeks,\u201d he told Reuters.  \u201cWe want to make sure that the accounts are down to prevent their ability to pivot them to facilitate a hack and leak around the U.S. election.\u201d  Facebook said the networks were small with only a handful of accounts on its website and photo-sharing service Instagram, and a combined total of around 97,000 followers.  Twitter said it had worked with Facebook to identify and remove 350 accounts that were operated by state-linked organisations in Russia.  Both companies said one of the networks had been identified following a tip from the FBI, which warned on Tuesday that foreign actors and cybercriminals were likely to spread disinformation about the results of November\u2019s election.  The warnings follow an alert by Microsoft earlier this month that hackers linked to Russia, China, and Iran are trying to spy on people tied to both U.S. President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden.  Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab, worked with Facebook to analyse the suspended accounts. He said the activity showed Russia was continuing efforts to exacerbate political tensions in the United States and elsewhere.  \u201cThat doesn\u2019t dismiss the fact that the scale and scope of domestic disinformation is far greater than what any foreign adversary could do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Russia\u2019s efforts remain an extremely serious national security vulnerability.\u201d","1233":"Dec 11 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc is looking into a bomb threat at its headquarters campus in Menlo Park, a company spokesman said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

The ads, which have been removed, enticed people to send money to purchase bitcoin or participate in fake cryptocurrency-related businesses with claims of De Mol\u2019s involvement, endorsement or backing.

That beat analysts\u2019 average expectation of 184.91 million, according to Refinitiv data.  \u201cWe do not foresee a sequential decline in daily active users in Q1 2019,\u201d said Lara Sweet, Snap\u2019s interim chief financial officer, in prepared remarks. She gave no specific outlook on user numbers.  Snap\u2019s revenue, which it earns from selling advertising on the app, increased 36 percent to $389.8 million, beating Wall Street\u2019s average estimate of $377.52 million.  Average revenue per user was $2.09 during the fourth quarter, up from $1.53 in the year-ago quarter.  The company\u2019s net loss narrowed to $191.67 million, or 14 cents per share, compared with $349.98 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier.  Snap has launched more video content with the aim of keeping hold of its users.  For the first quarter, Snap said it expects revenue of $285 million to $310 million. That compares with the average analyst estimate for revenue of $307 million, according to data from IBES Refinitiv.

Google said in a court filing that the first case alleging it monopolized online display advertising was filed in  May by an advertiser, and that since then five other cases have been filed.  All were filed in the Northern District of California, \u201cthe venue where Google is headquartered and where more relevant witnesses and documents are located than in any other district in the country,\u201d Google said in its request to move the case, which was filed late on Tuesday.

His eponymous firm has had a lead role in some of the biggest cases of the past few years, including a $650 million biometric privacy settlement with Facebook in 2020 and a 2019 jury verdict of more than $900 million in a Telephone Consumer Protection Act case against the telemarketer ViSalus. Edelson has a powerful interest, in other words, in the integrity of the class action system.  He claims that Equifax\u2019s $380.5 million data breach settlement undermines public faith in that system, accusing the judge and class counsel of adding to cynicism about the benefits of class actions.  Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.  Edelson made that assertion in an amicus brief filed Friday at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where objectors are challenging final approval of the settlement by U.S. District Judge Thomas Thrash of Atlanta.  Edelson echoed arguments by objectors' lawyers from the Hamilton Lincoln Law Institute that Judge Thrash and class counsel neglected to account for potential damages for class members in jurisdictions with robust statutory penalties for privacy violations, like Utah and the District of Columbia. At the very least, Edelson said, Judge Thrash should have required class counsel from Doffermyre Shields Canfield & Knowles, DiCello Levitt Gutzler and Stueve Siegel Hanson to submit evidence of the range of potential recovery, based on statutory damages, for the nearly 150 million people whose personal information was compromised in the 2017 Equifax breach. Instead, Edelson\u2019s brief argued, class counsel merely asserted that the settlement would avert the prospect that their entire case might be tossed if they could not show concrete injuries from the breach. Judge Thrash, he said, abused his discretion by failing to calculate how much of a discount the settlement imposes on class members.  I emailed class counsel for a response to Edelson\u2019s brief. They did not provide a statement. It\u2019s worth noting that, according to a declaration class counsel filed to bolster their $77.5 million fee request, state regulators \u2013 who presumably have an interest in enforcing the statutory penalties cited by Edelson and objectors \u2013 had a strong say in the settlement Judge Thrash approved. For his part, Edelson represented the city of Chicago in the data breach litigation against Equifax. (The company, broadly speaking, claimed that plaintiffs could not trace any alleged injuries to the breach of its data safeguards.) Chicago alleged violations of its consumer fraud statute, which carries penalties of up to $10,000 for each offense. The city settled its claims last April for $1.5 million.  Edelson\u2019s amicus brief doesn\u2019t just assert legal arguments about a trial judge\u2019s discretion, though. The filing alleges that the Equifax settlement process eroded confidence that class actions protect consumers. As you may recall, and as Edelson\u2019s brief recounts, early news of the settlement \u2013 including the initial, short-form notice to class members \u2013 suggested that class members who had not suffered out-of-pocket losses would be entitled either to credit monitoring or a $125 cash payment. Millions of people attempted to sign up for the $125 payment. But in a subsequent notice to the class, class counsel underscored that the cash payment was available only to class members who could prove they already had credit monitoring services \u2013 and that $125 was a ceiling, not a guarantee, from a $31 million cash fund for class members without out-of-pocket claims. Edelson\u2019s brief noted that class counsel have not said precisely what individual class members will end up getting from the fund, but objectors have estimated the amount to be just a few dollars.  Confusion about the settlement terms is entirely the fault of class counsel, Edelson\u2019s brief said. And its effects will taint the entire class action bar, he argued. \u201cThis case involved an issue that affected nearly every (if not every) adult American,\u201d the brief said. \u201cThe whole country was watching. And when the class action bar stepped up to do its part to help right this wrong, our representatives provided inadequate compensation, misleading notice, and an ad hoc and confusing claims process. It seems no understatement to say that, because of what happened here, no class action notices for some time will carry any air of credibility.\u201d  That\u2019s strong stuff \u2013 and from a plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer who will almost certainly cross paths in some future case with the fellow class action lawyers whose work the brief slams. In an email, Edelson told me there\u2019s an \u201cunwritten rule in the plaintiff\u2019s bar that we are not supposed to do things like file amicus briefs criticizing settlements or speaking out against bad settlements publicly.\u201d But the Equifax deal, he said, undermines his firm\u2019s push for class action settlements that deliver cash to class members.  \u201cIt will undermine public confidence in class actions generally and privacy deals in particular,\u201d Edelson said. \u201cThat is the headwind we are fighting against and why we decided to file the brief.\u201d  Edelson is generally no friend to so-called \u201cserial\u201d class action objectors: His firm last year forced a lawyer who had objected to one of his TCPA settlements to agree not to practice in Illinois. He said, however, that he and Ted Frank of the Hamilton Lincoln Law Institute, who is one of the objectors appealing the Equifax deal, \u201chave some overlapping goals, even though we see the broader world very differently.\u201d  Edelson previously represented Frank as the lead plaintiff in a TCPA suit but the two have not joined forces in a class action objection. Frank joked in an email that if the 11th Circuit overturns approval of the Equifax settlement, Edelson could represent a subclass - with Frank as the class representative.  The appeal is Huang v. Spector and Equifax, No. 20-10249 at the 11th Circuit.","1238":"Oct 31 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks opened higher on Wednesday and were set for a second day of gains at the end of a brutal month, as Facebook led a slew of encouraging earnings reports.

The World Jewish Congress and the American Jewish Committee praised the move.  \u201cFor several years, the World Jewish Congress has advocated for Facebook to remove Holocaust denial content from its platform,\u201d that group said in a statement.  This summer, civil rights groups organized a widespread Facebook advertising boycott to try to pressure social media companies to act against hate speech on their platforms.  \u201cThis has been years in the making.

But the Wall Street Journal reported this week that JPMorgan had declined to join the project due to concerns the digital currency could be used for criminal activities that would violate money-laundering and sanctions rules.  The ambitious efforts of Facebook Inc to establish a global digital currency have suffered severe setbacks in recent weeks, after several high profile partners including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and eBay abandoned the project.  The exodus followed a pushback from policymakers and regulators in the United States and Europe over concerns Libra could upend the global financial system, threaten users\u2019 privacy and facilitate money laundering.  David Marcus, a Facebook executive who has been leading the project, said this week he expected to get 100 banks and financial firms on board once the project has addressed regulatory concerns..  Speaking to reporters Thursday night, Marcus said Libra did not need banks or payment firms to launch the system, however.

The case is the latest to question whether methods used by technology firms such as Google and Apple to transfer data outside the 28-nation European Union give EU consumers sufficient protection from U.S. surveillance.  The Irish High Court this month ordered the case to be referred to the EU\u2019s top court to assess whether the methods used for data transfers - including standard contractual clauses and the Privacy Shield agreement - were legal.  It said the case raised well-founded concerns that there was an absence of an effective remedy in U.S. law compatible with EU legal requirements.  A ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) against the legal arrangements could cause major headaches for thousands of companies, which make millions of these transfers every day.  Facebook on Monday sought a delay to ask the Irish Supreme Court for the right to appeal the referral, but High Court Judge Caroline Costello on Wednesday refused the request and ordered the referral to be made immediately.  \u201cI am of the opinion that the court will cause the least injustice if it refuses any stay and delivers the reference immediately to the Court of Justice,\u201d Costello told the court.  Facebook said it will still seek permission from the Irish Supreme Court to appeal the referral, but the move will not delay the ECJ\u2019s hearing of the case.  The case, taken by Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems, was heard in Ireland because it is the location of Facebook\u2019s headquarters for most of its markets outside the United States.","1250":"WASHINGTON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey has agreed to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee on Oct. 28, the company said Friday.

A coalition of consumer groups asked the FTC to investigate whether Facebook had engaged in deceptive practices, claiming the company lured children into making extensive in-game purchases without parental consent.  The social media company settled a class action lawsuit on the issue in 2016, but further details came to light last month after a request by the Center for Investigative Reporting here resulted in the unsealing of the court documents.  The documents revealed that Facebook employees referred to the practice as \u201cfriendly fraud\u201d and called children who racked up thousands of dollars in charges \u201cwhales,\u201d a term commonly used in casinos to describe high-spending gamblers.  \u201cWe urge the FTC to review in detail the complaint that was filed today on this issue. It shouldn\u2019t take another settlement for Facebook to meet its ethical obligation to protect kids and families on its platform,\u201d Senators Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal said in a statement.  They said Facebook dodged their questions on the issue, posed to CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a letter last month after the documents were unsealed.  \u201cFacebook\u2019s answers to our reasonable questions were inadequate and do not inspire trust,\u201d they said.  Facebook was not immediately available for comment.  In its prior response to the lawmakers, Facebook did not explain why it did not act on widespread complaints before the case went to court and declined to answer specifically when Zuckerberg became aware of the issue, the senators said.  Facebook is facing a slew of lawsuits and regulatory inquiries over its record on privacy, security and the use of its platform by groups spreading disinformation.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo  The board will be able to make final decisions on whether individual pieces of content - such as a sensitive video or ad - should be displayed on the site, even over-ruling Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg.  The board is one of Facebook\u2019s high-profile efforts to respond to criticism over how it handles problematic content and transparency around its decision-making. It also released an assessment on the human rights impacts of content decisions by the board.  However, the board\u2019s creation is behind schedule, the company confirmed in a blog post. Facebook will probably not name the board\u2019s co-chairs and first members until after January 2020.  Brent Harris, Facebook\u2019s head of governance and global affairs, said the delays were due to both the unforeseen complexities of creating a trust to ensure the board\u2019s independence and to the task of reducing more than 1,000 nominees to no more than about 40.  \u201cThis is not a \u2018move fast and break things\u2019 project,\u201d Harris told Reuters by telephone, referring to the social media network\u2019s early motto.  He said the recommended members had come through Facebook\u2019s global consultation process in 88 countries, as well as the company\u2019s public online portal, which opened in September.  They range from \u201cformer heads of state to Nobel Prize winners to people who moderate groups on Facebook to local judges,\u201d Harris said.  Facebook plans to announce the board\u2019s co-chairs, likely to number three, he said, and a first set of about 20 members after January.  Both Facebook and its users can submit cases to the board, and while it cannot make policy, Facebook will be required to respond publicly to any recommendations.  \u201cThe board is an actual institution; it\u2019s almost like its own start-up and it needs all the things that new institutions need\u201d such as a legal team and recruiting mechanisms, said Heather Moore, a member of the Facebook team who developed the board\u2019s charter.  The social media giant said the $130 million should cover operational costs for at least six years.  Kate Klonick, an assistant law professor at St. John\u2019s University whom Facebook allowed to observe the process of establishing the board, said that while she was disappointed by the timeline, the scale of funding was positive.  \u201cThe fact they announced this commitment of money is an enormous sign of how important it\u2019s going to be,\u201d Klonick told Reuters.","1256":"LONDON (Reuters) - The cryptocurrency market took a beating on Tuesday with bitcoin losing over 10% in value after U.S. lawmakers grilled Facebook on its cryptocurrency plans, as political and regulatory scrutiny of digital coins intensifies.  The social media giant is fighting to get Washington onside after it shocked regulators and lawmakers with its announcement on June 18 that it was hoping to launch its own digital coin called Libra in 2020.  David Marcus, the company\u2019s top executive overseeing the planned Libra project, answered questions from the Senate Banking Committee. During the hearing, a U.S. senator said Facebook was \u201cdelusional\u201d to believe people will trust it with their money.  Facebook\u2019s Libra plan, which is seen as a major step for wider adaptation of virtual currencies, has helped stoke this year\u2019s rally in bitcoin, ethereum and other digital coins.  \u201cLibra is essentially slammed in the Senate,\u201d said Lennon Sweeting, head trader at Coinsquare Capital Markets Ltd. \u201cIt\u2019s just headline-driven volatility.\u201d  Digital currencies will likely recover with bitcoin returning to a $11,000-$12,000 trading range, Sweeting said.  At 2:56 p.m. (1856 GMT), bitcoin fell 11.69% to $9,582.12 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange. It fell below $10,000 for the first time in two weeks.  The world\u2019s biggest and best-known cryptocurrency climbed to nearly $14,000 in late June, not long after Facebook unveiled its Libra plan. That was still far below its record high of nearly $20,000 set at end of 2017.  Ethereum, the No. 2 virtual currency, lost 13.32% to $198.2 after hitting $190.41, which was its lowest level since May 13.  Other widely followed currencies such as ripple were down 8% on the day.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Instagram could do worse than unfriend Facebook. The photo-sharing site may be worth more than 80 times what the social network founded by Mark Zuckerberg paid six years ago. Now, though, the data leaks engulfing its corporate parent risk becoming a liability. Separating Instagram off \u2013 even if Facebook were to remain its biggest shareholder \u2013 might be a wise pre-emptive move.  Facebook snapped up Instagram for $1 billion on April 9, 2012. The visual app was growing fast and attracting new users, but the price tag still looked like an example of inflated Silicon Valley valuations. Instagram had been valued at around $20 million the year before Zuckerberg knocked on the door of founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger.  The acquisition turned out to be a savvy one. And to Zuckerberg\u2019s credit, he allowed Instagram to flourish, retain its brand and remain effectively separate as far as users are concerned. Facebook doesn\u2019t break out Instagram\u2019s financial performance, but it is undoubtedly contributing a sizable chunk to Facebook\u2019s top line. Analysts at Wells Fargo reckon that Instagram made nearly $4.5 billion in advertising revenue last year, representing more than 10 percent of Facebook\u2019s haul.  One way to figure Instagram\u2019s worth is to compare it to Snap, the $18 billion parent of the disappearing-messaging app that fancies itself a camera company. Investors value Snap\u2019s equity, after deducting its net cash balance, at 10 times sales for the next 12 months, according to Thomson Reuters data. Revenue is expected to increase 60 percent to $1.3 billion.  Instagram\u2019s 500 million daily active users vastly outnumber Snap\u2019s 187 million, and its revenue is expected to grow at a faster pace. Instagram has 1.8 percent of the global digital ad market, eMarketer reckons. If it can add another 1 percentage point, revenue would hit $8 billion in 2018. Pop that on Snap\u2019s multiple and Instagram has an enterprise value of $80 billion, almost one-fifth of Facebook\u2019s total.  More than half of Americans don\u2019t realize that Facebook owns Instagram, according to a survey conducted by internet privacy company DuckDuckGo. But increasing public scrutiny of Facebook by lawmakers, and distrust over the way it handles user data, could blemish Instagram\u2019s own fortunes. Facebook might be better off setting it free before that happens.","1258":"May 19 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc is launching Facebook Shops, a service that will allow small businesses to display and sell their products on the social network\u2019s platforms, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said on Tuesday.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Facebook is late to fighting an existential threat for the second time in its 14-year life. Poor security, low-quality content and excessive advertising are as big a danger to Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s company as the 2012 growth of mobile. Facebook finally appears focused on the threat, but it won\u2019t be as easy to solve via acquisitions and improved apps.  The social network\u2019s value comes from holding the attention of its many customers. That\u2019s what advertisers follow, but the converse isn\u2019t true, which is why mobile\u2019s growth before Facebook\u2019s IPO frightened the firm. The app was clunky, and upstarts built around mobile photography, such as Instagram, threatened the company\u2019s desktop-predominant audience.  What followed was a massive, successful response. Zuckerberg spent $1 billion for Instagram when it had no revenue. Likewise he frantically tried to make Facebook\u2019s core app user-friendly. Now Instagram is worth an estimated $80 billion, according to a Breakingviews analysis in April, while over 90 percent of Facebook\u2019s advertising revenue is mobile.  Recent news that hackers stole codes permitting them to log into nearly 50 million accounts is the latest warning the company\u2019s size and complexity may render it too difficult to control. Regulator trust has dissipated \u2013 the Federal Trade Commission, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission and 37 state attorneys general are probing the company. Watchdogs worldwide are circling, and the firm may face a fine of up to 4 percent of annual revenue in Europe for its recent hack.  Zuckerberg\u2019s outfit is taking action. It has deleted over 1 billion fake accounts, doubled the number of employees working on safety and security to 20,000 and hired Nathaniel Gleicher - formerly with the National Security Council - to run its efforts. Zuckerberg even says the firm is \u201cinvesting so much in security that it will significantly impact our profitability.\u201d  Past success suggests its efforts shouldn\u2019t be dismissed. Figuring out how to protect a site of over 2 billion users is extremely difficult, as its size and influence make it a tempting target for the most sophisticated hackers. User trust is difficult to regain once lost. And scaling back advertising could slow revenue growth further.

Facebook\u2019s total revenue, which primarily consists of ad sales, rose 22% to $21.47 billion from $17.65 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, beating analysts\u2019 estimates of a 12% rise, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  A July ad boycott over Facebook\u2019s handling of hate speech, which saw some of the social media giant\u2019s biggest individual spenders press pause, barely made a dent in its sales, which mostly come from small businesses.  Revenue growth at Facebook, the world\u2019s second-biggest seller of online ads after Google, has been cooling steadily as its business matures, although it came in at more than 20% throughout 2019.  Still, compared to expectations, the company has had a bumper year due to surging use of its platforms by users stuck at home amid virus-related lockdowns, which cushioned online ad sales even as broader economic activity suffered.  USER BASE GROWTH  Facebook continued to expand its user base, with monthly active users rising to 2.74 billion, compared with estimates of 2.70 billion according to the IBES data, although user numbers declined in North America compared to the second quarter.  The company projected that trend would continue for the rest of the year, with user numbers either flat or slightly down in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.  \u201cIt appears that investors are disappointed that despite user growth jumping across most regions during the quarter, the social media platform reported a decrease in users in North America, which covers the U.S. and Canada - its most lucrative ad market,\u201d said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.  Total expenses increased 28% to $13.43 billion, with costs continuing to grow as Facebook tries to build out its non-ad businesses and quell criticism that its handling of user privacy and abusive content is lax.  Facebook CFO Dave Wehner said on an earnings conference call that expenses would rise due to the costs of returning work-from-home staff to offices as well as increased headcount, product investments and higher legal expenses.  He said the company was expecting a margin decline as a result, although he did not give specific revenue guidance.  The company has been under especially strong pressure ahead of next week\u2019s U.S. presidential election and is aiming to avoid a repeat of 2016, when Russia used its platforms to spread election-related misinformation.  EMarketer principal analyst Debra Aho Williamson said Facebook remains \u201ca go-to for advertisers\u201d seeking to reach a broad set of consumers, despite its content moderation issues, but said that may change in 2021.  \u201cWe expect that more advertisers will take a hard look at their reliance on Facebook and will ask themselves whether the environment is safe for their brands,\u201d she said.  Net income came in at $7.85 billion, or $2.71 per share, compared with $6.09 billion, or $2.12 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected a profit of $1.90 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.","1268":"NEW YORK\/SAN FRANCISCO, July 26 (Reuters) - A plunge in Facebook Inc shares rattled the Amazon.com Inc options market on Thursday, with the social network\u2019s fellow FAANG company due to report quarterly results later in the day.  Facebook on Wednesday warned about a margin hit as revenue growth slows and user privacy costs climb, and its 20 percent share drop heightened focus on the online retailer, already a closely watched stock.  Amazon was the second-biggest decliner in the so-called FAANG group of high-flying tech companies, but Facebook\u2019s second-quarter earnings also cast a pall on shares of Apple Inc , Netflix Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc .  The Nasdaq was down nearly 1 percent at midday, even while the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded up 0.5 percent.  Amazon shares fell nearly 3 percent to $1,811.66, while shares of Netflix, Alphabet and Apple were flat.  \u201cThose investors who were tempted to hold Amazon through earnings saw Facebook and decided to sell,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago.  \u201cThis is a move to take some risk off the table,\u201d Ablin said.  Weekly options on Amazon implied a 5.5 percent swing in either direction by Friday, up about 1 percentage point from what they implied on Wednesday just before Facebook posted results, according to data from options analytics firm Trade Alert.  \u201cThat is opposite to what normally happens,\u201d said Fred Ruffy, analyst at New York-based Trade Alert. \u201cVolatility perceptions have increased after Facebook.\u201d  All things being equal, the value of options decline over time, meaning that as the days pass there is a tendency for the move implied by the options price to shrink.  The implied move for Amazon is now bigger than its 4 percent average move the day after results over the last eight quarters.  On Thursday, for the first time in more than two months, traders in Amazon options displayed a preference for puts over calls.  By 12:20 p.m. ET, 52,000 Amazon puts traded versus 48,000 calls.  Calls convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future. Puts convey the right to sell shares at a fixed price and give the option holder protection against a price decline.  The strong demand for protection was also evident in the sharp rise in the price of puts.  The cost of a put contract that would protect against a drop in Amazon shares below $1,830 by the end of trading on Friday jumped about 80 percent to $50.72, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Group backers said they were organizing peaceful protests, had been working hard to police the comments and that Facebook had given no warning. Chris Barron, a spokesman for the group, said political opponents were also organizing protests but were not banned.  \u201cIf Facebook wants to become the arbiter of truth then they\u2019ve got a lot of work to do,\u201d Barron said.  Facebook said the group\u2019s removal was in line with \u201cexceptional measures\u201d amid \u201cheightened tension.\u201d  Measures Facebook introduced on Thursday include warning users results are not final as well as limiting how many people are shown live video about the election, or posts that the company\u2019s algorithms believe contain political misinformation.  For months, Trump and Republican allies have been laying the groundwork to cast doubt on the integrity of the vote in case the president lost his re-election bid.  As tallies increasingly improve the odds for Trump\u2019s Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, and as U.S. broadcasters and other major media outlets brush off Trump\u2019s claims of victory, the president and his supporters have taken to social media to try to turn the narrative around, floating conspiratorial theories using the hashtag #StopTheSteal.  But social media companies have been signaling less patience with disinformation and calls for violence. Eleven of the president\u2019s 32 tweets since Election Day on Tuesday have been placed behind a warning label saying they were disputed, prompting him to use email and other media to voice his claims, researchers said.  \u201cSocial media platforms can\u2019t allow themselves to be used to foment anti-democratic and potentially violent activity,\u201d said Paul Barrett, deputy director of New York University\u2019s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights.  BANNON SUSPENDED  On Thursday, Snap Inc's SNAP.N Snapchat removed a video from Trump's account in which Biden said he has an extensive \"voter fraud organization.\" Biden's statement came during an interview in which he was discussing his team fighting voter suppression efforts, and Snap determined that Trump's use out of context violated its policy against undermining the integrity of civic processes.  Trump campaign social media manager Ryann McEnany decried Snap\u2019s action in a tweet, saying in capital letters: \u201cWhy won\u2019t they let the American people see this!?\u201d  Twitter on Thursday suspended an account used by former Trump campaign manager Steve Bannon after he recorded a video in which he called for beheading FBI Director Christopher Wray as well as government infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci for being disloyal to Trump.  A Twitter spokesman cited company policy against glorifying violence. Other services also removed the video on similar grounds.  But the takedowns and warnings are something Trump supporters appear prepared for. Before Facebook deleted \u201cStop the Steal,\u201d organizers directed members to an email sign-up page \u201cin the event that social media censors this group.\u201d  The group\u2019s membership surged because seven prominent conservatives promoted it to their hundreds of thousands of followers, according to Renee DiResta, a researcher involved in the anti-misinformation Election Integrity Partnership.  While Facebook groups typically work as forums for shared interests, they can harbor hyper-partisan misinformation.  \u201cFacebook has been enabling and amplifying the infrastructure that\u2019s now being used to attack our democratic process,\u201d said Arisha Hatch, executive director of the Color of Change political action committee, one of the country\u2019s largest online racial justice groups.  A review of a small number of comments posted to \u201cStop the Steal\u201d before its deletion found no direct calls for violence, but its organizing premise - that Republican votes are being \u201cnullified\u201d by Democrats - has no basis in fact.  Facebook, which normally recommends groups to users that they may want to join, last week suspended these recommendations for political groups and new groups around the election.  The \u201cStop the Steal\u201d group was run by the Trump action group Women for America First. The non-profit organized protests against COVID-19 restrictions and supported Trump during his impeachment hearing.","1271":"A federal judge overseeing the multidistrict litigation over Facebook Inc\u2019s data privacy scandal involving British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica on Tuesday said a lawsuit on behalf of the citizens of the state of Illinois belonged in state court.

The face recognition setting, available to some Facebook users since December 2017, has additional functions such as notifying account holders if their profile photo is used by someone else.  People who opt in to the new setting will still have tag suggestions automatically generated about them.  Facebook\u2019s face recognition technology has been at the center of a privacy related lawsuit since 2015.  The lawsuit by Illinois users accused the company of violating the state\u2019s Biometric Information Privacy Act, claiming it illegally collected and stored biometric data of millions of users without their consent.  Last month, a federal appeals court rejected Facebook\u2019s effort to undo the class action status of the lawsuit.  \u201cWe have always disclosed our use of face recognition technology and that people can turn it on or off at any time,\u201d Facebook said last month.

The first probe, led by New York and including seven other states and the District of Columbia, focuses on Facebook. The second, announced by Texas and likely to include up to 40 other states, did not specify the targets among large tech companies but was expected to center on Google.  Once lauded as engines of economic growth, the companies in social media, Internet search, e-commerce and other digital technologies have increasingly been on the defensive over lapses such as privacy breaches and their outsized market influence.  Politicians including President Donald Trump, consumers, other firms and regulators have criticized that power.  \u201cI\u2019m launching an investigation into Facebook to determine whether their actions endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers\u2019 choices or increased the price of advertising,\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James tweeted.  \u201cThe largest social media platform in the world must follow the law,\u201d she said.  The Facebook probe will include New York, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and the District of Columbia, (on.ny.gov\/2lG1unu).  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton\u2019s office said it was leading an investigation of large tech companies but did not name them.  That probe, likely to include more than 40 state attorneys general, is expected to focus on Google, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. A second source previously said that the Google investigation would look at the intersection of privacy and antitrust.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam\/File Photo  Google\u2019s parent Alphabet said on Friday the Department of Justice in late August requested information and documents related to prior antitrust probes of the company. The company added in a securities filing that it expects similar investigative demands from state attorneys general, and that it is cooperating with regulators.  On the federal level, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are probing Facebook, Google, Apple AAPL.O and Amazon AMZN.O, also for potential violations of antitrust law.  Trump has called for closer scrutiny of social media firms and Google, accusing them of suppressing conservative voices online without presenting any evidence.  Facebook\u2019s shares were down nearly 2% in afternoon trading. Google, Apple and Amazon stocks were virtually unchanged.  Will Castleberry, Facebook\u2019s vice president for state and local policy, said after the New York announcement that the company would work constructively with state attorneys general.  \u201cPeople have multiple choices for every one of the services we provide. We understand that if we stop innovating, people can easily leave our platform. This underscores the competition we face, not only in the United States but around the globe,\u201d Castleberry said.  CRITICISMS OVER PRIVACY, MARKET CONTROL  The tech companies have come under fire repeatedly in recent years. Facebook, for example, has been slow to clamp down on hate speech, and it recently paid a $5 billion settlement for sharing 87 million users\u2019 data with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The consultancy\u2019s clients included Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign.  The social media platform, which owns one-time rivals Instagram and WhatsApp and has more than 1.5 billion daily users, has been criticized for allowing misleading posts and so-called \u201cfake news\u201d on its service.  Google has faced accusations that its web search service, which has become so dominant that it is now a verb, leads consumers to its own products at the cost of competitors.  \u201cWe look forward to working with the attorneys general to answer questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector,\u201d Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said in an email.  Amazon, the world\u2019s biggest online retailer, has been accused of unfair tactics with third-party sellers on its website, who must pay for advertising to compete against first-party and private label sales by Amazon itself.  Apple has come under fire from app developers over practices like making only iPhone apps available through its official App Store. The music-streaming app Spotify SPOT.N has alleged that App Store policies make it difficult to compete against Apple Music for paid subscribers.  Amazon and Apple had no immediate comment.  State attorneys general often act jointly to influence policy, including when the federal government lacks the resources or is disinclined to act.  The attorneys general of 20 states and the District of Columbia teamed up with the U.S. Department of Justice in 1998 to sue Microsoft Corp MSFT.O for trying to extend its monopoly in personal computer operating systems to internet browsing software. That case later settled.  More recently, 43 states and Puerto Rico sued Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd TEVA.O and 19 other drugmakers in May, accusing them of scheming to inflate prices and reduce competition for more than 100 generic drugs.","1275":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence vowed on Tuesday to protect domestic elections from foreign interference, hours after Facebook said it had identified a new effort to use its site to influence November\u2019s U.S. congressional elections.

U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is probing whether Trump campaign officials worked with Moscow to try to sway the 2016 presidential election.

Facebook said last month it would launch its global cryptocurrency in 2020. Facebook and 28 partners, including Mastercard Inc MA.N, PayPal Holdings Inc PYPL.O and Uber Technologies Inc UBER.N, would form the Libra Association to govern the new coin. No banks are currently part of the group.  JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, the largest U.S. bank by assets, plans to launch its own digital coins.  Trump\u2019s comments come one day after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told lawmakers that Facebook\u2019s plan to build a digital currency called Libra could not move forward unless it addressed concerns over privacy, money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability.  Powell said the Fed had established a working group to follow the project and was coordinating with other countries\u2019 central banks, several of which have also expressed concern about Facebook\u2019s digital currency project.

The independent board, which will be able to overturn Facebook and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s decisions on whether individual pieces of content should be allowed on Facebook and Instagram, is a high-profile response to criticism of how the social media company handles problematic content.  Facebook said the board\u2019s members have lived in 27 countries and speak at least 29 languages, though a quarter of the group and two of the four co-chairs are from the United States, where the company is headquartered.  The co-chairs, who selected the other members jointly with Facebook, are former U.S. federal circuit judge and religious freedom expert Michael McConnell, constitutional law expert Jamal Greene, Colombian attorney Catalina Botero-Marino and former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt.  Among the initial cohort are: former European Court of Human Rights judge Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3, Internet Sans Fronti\u00e8res Executive Director Julie Owono, Yemeni Nobel Peace Prize laureate Tawakkol Karman, Australian internet governance researcher Nicolas Suzor and Pakistani digital rights advocate Nighat Dad.

The oversight board will start work immediately and Clegg said it would begin hearing cases this summer.  The board, which will grow to about 40 members and which Facebook has pledged $130 million to fund for at least six years, will make public, binding decisions on a small slice of controversial cases where users have exhausted Facebook\u2019s usual appeals process. The company can also refer significant decisions to the board, including on ads or on Facebook groups.  The board can make policy recommendations to Facebook based on case decisions, to which the company will publicly respond.

The Federal Reserve raised interest rates and forecast at least two more hikes for 2018, signaling growing confidence that U.S. tax cuts and government spending will boost the economy and inflation and lead to more aggressive future tightening.  The hike was widely expected, and investors will turn to a press conference from new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for signals on the number of hikes planned for the year.  \u201cEverybody expected the rate increase but there was some question if it would go to three rates to four, it stayed flat at three raises for now,\u201d said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta.  \u201cThe reason was the Fed statement that economic activity has been moderating since the last time they talked about it.\u201d The reason was the Fed statement that economic activity has been moderating since the last time they talked about it.

In a sharp sell-off over two days, the social media company lost about $50 billion in market value over reports of data misuse that raised broader questions about consumer privacy and the need for tougher regulation.  The technology index was up 0.09 percent.  Energy jumped 2.77 percent and helped lift equities for a second straight session. Crude oil prices hit a six-week high after a surprise decline in U.S. inventories and as concern persisted over possible disruption to Middle East supply.  While markets are sure about the quarter-point rate hike, they are less confident of what the Fed signals next: three increases this year, as previously forecast by policy makers, or four.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 147.03 points, or 0.59 percent, to 24,874.3, the S&P 500 gained 10.31 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,727.25 and the Nasdaq Composite added 13.36 points, or 0.18 percent, to 7,377.66.  General Mills slumped 9.52 percent after the company cut its full-year profit forecast due to higher freight and commodity costs.

FILE PHOTO: Pump jacks operate at sunset in Midland, Texas, U.S., February 11, 2019. Picture taken February 11, 2019. REUTERS\/Nick Oxford\/File Photo  Examples of posts making this claim can be found here , here and here .  The earliest iteration of the claim on Facebook appears to have been posted on Jan. 28, 2021 (here). According to data published here by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the United States exported an average of nearly 3.4 million barrels a day for the week ending on Jan. 22, up from nearly 2.3 million the week before.  For the week ending on Jan. 29, the United States exported nearly 3.5 million barrels per day, followed by just over 2.6 million barrels a day for the week ending on Feb. 5 (here).  These amounts were not the \u201chighest\u201d ever in oil exports, as the posts claim. U.S. oil exports last peaked at nearly 4.5 million barrels a day for the week ending Dec. 27, 2019.  These amounts were also not the \u201clowest\u201d ever, as the posts claim. Between February 1991 and the time of this article\u2019s publication, U.S. crude oil exports hit an all-time low of 10,000 barrels a day several times between November 2002 and April 2005 (here). The latest reported export rate of nearly 2.6 million barrels a day (for the week ending Feb. 5, 2021) is nearly 260 times that amount.  In late 2015, then-President Barack Obama lifted a four-decade ban on crude exports (here , here). The EIA data clearly shows this uptick in exports.  Petroleum exports until recently were dominated by products like gasoline and diesel, but that has changed since the U.S. shale revolution that has sped up drilling and extraction of oil, helping boost overall U.S. production to record levels.  Notably, claims about alleged drops in U.S. oil and gas exports have been circulating during the first several weeks of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. A Reuters explainer on how Biden\u2019s presidency will transform the U.S. energy landscape is available here .  President Biden\u2019s has promised to ban issuance of new drilling permits on federal lands and waters in order to fight global climate change. Such a ban would mean that domestic oil output would trend toward zero over a matter of years.  Biden\u2019s view is that climate change is an existential threat to the planet, and that a transition from fossil fuels can be an economic opportunity if the United States moves fast enough to become a leader in clean energy technology.  As for natural gas, Reuters was unable to verify this part of the Facebook claim because the EIA does not publish U.S. export data at a weekly level. The most recent monthly data available is for November 2020 and can be seen here .  VERDICT  False.

The Indian government has previously told the U.S. company to take steps to prevent the circulation of false texts and provocative content that had led to a series of lynchings and mob beatings across India.  WhatsApp has since launched a media advertising blitz, done roadshows, and held workshops with community leaders and police officials to curb the spread of misinformation through its platform.  The appointment of Ezetap\u2019s Bose highlights California-based WhatsApp\u2019s ambitions in the payments space.  It has been testing a payments service in India and is awaiting a final nod from India\u2019s central bank for a full launch of the service.

NSO has argued that, because it sells digital break-in tools to police and spy agencies, it should benefit from \u201csovereign immunity\u201d - a legal doctrine that generally insulates foreign governments from lawsuits. NSO lost that argument in the Northern District of California in July and has since appealed to the Ninth Circuit to have the ruling overturned.  Microsoft, Alphabet-owned Google, Cisco, Dell Technologies-owned VMWare and the Washington-based Internet Association joined forces with Facebook to argue against that, saying that awarding soverign immunity to NSO would lead to a proliferation of hacking technology and \u201cmore foreign governments with powerful and dangerous cyber surveillance tools.\u201d  That in turn \u201cmeans dramatically more opportunities for those tools to fall into the wrong hands and be used nefariously,\u201d the brief argues.  NSO - which did not immediately return a message seeking comment - argues that its products are used to fight crime. But human rights defenders and technologists at places such as Toronto-based Citizen Lab and London-based Amnesty International have documented cases in which NSO technology has been used to target reporters, lawyers and even nutrionists lobbying for soda taxes.  Citizen Lab published a report on Sunday alleging that NSO\u2019s phone-hacking technology had been deployed to hack three dozen phones belonging to journalists, producers, anchors, and executives at Qatar-based broadcaster Al Jazeera as well as a device beloning to a reporter at London-based Al Araby TV.  NSO\u2019s spyware was also been linked to the slaying of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered and dismembered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018.

FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen in front of the logo of the European Union in this picture illustration made in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina on May 15, 2015. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  Jurisdictions around the world have been enacting rules to require Google, Facebook and others to share revenue with publishers, including a 2019 directive from Brussels which European Union countries are meant to enact into law by June.  So is the EU likely to face a Facebook news ban similar to the one imposed in Australia? No. Here are some reasons why:  EU COPYRIGHT RULES  Approved in 2019 to help Europe\u2019s creative industries get a fair share of revenues, the EU\u2019s copyright rules require Google and other online platforms to sign licensing agreements with musicians, performers, authors, news publishers and journalists to use their work.  The rules do not force online platforms to pay for links posted by publishers to their news site, the main grievance for Facebook with the Australian government.  In France, which was among the first EU countries to implement the new rules, news publishers have already struck a deal with Google which the European Commission, the EU executive, says is a clear sign that the copyright rules are effective in levelling the playing field.  Australia\u2019s so-called Media Bargaining Code is based on Australian competition laws, underlining a tougher approach than the EU.  FACEBOOK NEWS  Facebook sought to defuse pressure from news publishers last month by launching Facebook News in Britain and signing up new partners Channel 4 News, Daily Mail Group, DC Thomson, Financial Times, Sky News and Telegraph Media Group on top of other news outlets.  It is now seeking to enlist French and German media companies before rolling out the service in these two countries.  EUROPEAN MEDIA GROUPS  European media groups, part of the driving force behind the EU copyright rules, do not have the same clout and geographical scope as News Corp, which struck a global agreement with Google on Wednesday.  Large companies such as Germany\u2019s Bertelsmann and French group Vivendi mainly dominate in their national markets because of linguistic and cultural differences across the bloc.","1299":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Critics of Facebook Inc FB.O, including the organizers of an advertising boycott against the company, on Friday launched their own oversight board to review the company's content moderation practices.

However, regulators will have to keep a very close eye at the global level, and believe me, we will do it,\u201d Villeroy said.  Facebook has said it will apply for a license as a payments services operator in Switzerland, but this may not be comprehensive enough to satisfy regulators.  \u201cIf issuers of stable coins also want to offer banking services such as deposits, financial investments and loans, then they will have to obtain a banking license in all countries where they operate. Otherwise these activities would be illegal,\u201d Villeroy said.  To date, new entrants into the payments sector dominated by banks have been far smaller in size than Facebook, one of the Big Tech companies.  Villeroy said these smaller fintech companies don\u2019t have the resources to \u201cdisrupt\u201d banks, but Big Tech could fundamentally redefine activities in the financial system given their size and reach.  \u201cThis new situation is a major challenge for regulators and supervisors,\u201d he said.  Villeroy said his staff at France\u2019s national central bank were looking at the issues around a potential Central Bank digital currency (CDBC).  \u201cThis is a scintillating subject,\u201d he added. \u201cWe central banks should investigate the many questions it raises... and then decide on its own merits\u201d.  There was also need for a \u201cgenuine European strategy\u201d for cross-border retail payments for a sector that is already dominated by non-European firms from the U.S. and China.

REUTERS\/Elijah Nouvelage  NEW YORK\/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters Breakingviews) - Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s inner circle just got smaller. Chris Cox, the Facebook chief executive\u2019s long-time lieutenant and chief product officer, is quitting after Zuckerberg last week outlined a new direction for the $470 billion social network. It\u2019s hard to overstate how instrumental Cox has been. His departure is a wake-up call for investors.  Cox helpfully provided his reasons for leaving. In a Facebook post on Thursday that shed more light than a cryptic one-sentence regulatory filing, he wrote the upcoming transition is a \u201cbig project\u201d and Facebook will \u201cneed leaders who are excited to see the new direction through.\u201d Presumably he isn\u2019t one of those.  Other departures in the last year have included Instagram founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum, security chief Alex Stamos and veteran policy chief Elliot Schrage.  But even in this parade Cox stands out. He has been with the firm for 13 of its 15 years and he\u2019s arguably just as much an architect of Facebook\u2019s platform as Zuckerberg. Other than Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, he is perhaps the most important senior executive.  His exit may suggest Zuckerberg, who controls Facebook with supervoting stock and also serves as its chairman, is consolidating his power as he faces intense scrutiny from regulators around the world, mainly over the company\u2019s use of personal data. It should also stamp out any doubts about the seriousness of Zuckerberg\u2019s intent to change Facebook from an open connected platform to a private, encrypted network encompassing its Facebook platform, WhatsApp and Instagram.  That strategy is not, however, compatible with Facebook\u2019s current model, which allows brands to target ads based on consumer data. Nearly all of the company\u2019s $56 billion of revenue comes from advertising. It\u2019s extremely profitable: Facebook\u2019s operating margin is a chunky 45 percent. Pushing ads on private messages is a much harder sell.  Facebook\u2019s shares were trading down more than 2 percent on Friday. Something over $10 billion of lost market value may be enough of a reaction to Cox\u2019s exit. But it looks too little to allow for the smaller, radically different Facebook Zuckerberg seems to have in mind.","1302":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - More people have been venturing out for work and play in recent weeks in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to traffic data, even as some of the strictest stay-at-home orders in the country remain in a region that is home to global tech companies like Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Facebook Inc.  Before local health authorities imposed the nation\u2019s first regional shelter-in-place order on March 17, traffic had thinned on roads and bridges, as many of the area\u2019s biggest companies asked workers to do their jobs at home to help prevent spread of the coronavirus.  Once work from home became mandatory for all but essential workers, use of the region's seven bridges plummeted, with weekday crossings falling by early April to as much as 54% below last year's levels, data from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority show. (See: tmsnrt.rs\/2WL04Za)  Since then, traffic has edged up to levels only about a third below last year\u2019s as restrictions eased, allowing a few more businesses to open and, since Monday, curbside pickup at retailers.  Weekend bridge traffic has also crept up in recent weeks, though it is still down by nearly half compared to last year.  Dine-in restaurants remain closed, as are many other establishments such as nail salons, barbers and gyms that have begun to reopen in other parts of the country. Many parks remain closed, and local orders discourage travel for anything but essential purposes.  Even once more businesses are allowed to reopen, possibly after the region\u2019s current orders expire on May 31, it is likely traffic could stay well below pre-pandemic levels.  Close to half of Bay Area workers have jobs that can be done at home, research from University of Chicago Booth School of Business economists Jonathan Dingel and Brent Neiman shows. That compares with about 37% on average nationwide.","1303":"FILE PHOTO: Facebook logo displayed on a mobile phone is seen through a magnifying glass in this picture illustration taken February 9, 2021.

It was responding to a range of criticisms over issues such as data privacy, voter suppression, incitement of violence and a lack of transparency in political advertising.

The settlement was filed on Monday in the federal court in Manhattan and won preliminary approval from U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet.  It amounts to a small fraction of Facebook\u2019s current market value of roughly $537 billion as of Monday\u2019s market close.  Shareholders led by the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System and Fresno County Employees\u2019 Retirement Association in California accused Facebook of concealing internal concerns about how growth in mobile devices might reduce revenue, even as it quietly warned its banks to cut their forecasts.  Unlike in 2012, the Menlo Park, California-based company now generates most of its revenue from mobile devices and has estimated that mobile advertising generated more than 86 percent of its $40.7 billion total revenue in 2017.  The settlement resolves claims against Facebook, officials including Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and director Peter Thiel, and bank underwriters covering a five-day period surrounding the $16 billion IPO, from May 17 to May 21, 2012.  Facebook made its market debut on May 18 of that year at $38 per share and saw its share price languish below that level for more than a year before it rebounded.  \u201cResolving this case is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders,\u201d Associate General Counsel Sandeep Solanki said in a statement.  A lawyer for the shareholders did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Sweet scheduled a Sept. 5 hearing to consider final settlement approval.  The accord was reached after mediation, and provides an average recovery of about 11 cents per share, or 7 cents per share after possible legal fees and costs, court papers show.

K.N.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  The cost, which Facebook and Giphy declined to disclose, was placed at around $400 million by news website Axios.  The announcement comes at a time when the largest social media network is under scrutiny from regulators over antitrust concerns. In 2015 Giphy rebuffed a Facebook offer, choosing instead to continue integrating its products with multiple social media platforms, according to news site TechCrunch.  Both companies declined to comment on any earlier talks.  Giphy will become part of Instagram, the photo-sharing site owned by Facebook. Its GIF library, which can integrate with other apps, will be further integrated into Instagram and other Facebook-owned apps, the companies said.  \u201cPeople will still be able to upload GIFs; developers and API partners will continue to have the same access to GIPHY\u2019s APIs; and GIPHY\u2019s creative community will still be able to create great content,\u201d said Vishal Shah, Instagram\u2019s vice president of product, in the blog post.  \u201cWe will continue to make GIPHY openly available to the wider ecosystem,\u201d Giphy said in a post on blogging website Medium.  The American Economic Liberties Project, a Washington-based antitrust advocacy group, urged regulators to investigate and block the acquisition.  \u201cThe Facebook-Giphy merger is just the latest example of the Federal Trade Commission standing by while Facebook and Google centralize control over online communications,\u201d said Economic Liberties Executive Director Sarah Miller.  Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google acquired GIF platform Tenor in 2018 and integrated it into its image search function, which Miller said undermined the competitive market Giphy had created.  \u201cNow, Facebook is here to pick up the wreckage, and become even more powerful,\u201d she said.  A Facebook spokesman said Giphy\u2019s current integrations with social platforms like Twitter, Snapchat and ByteDance\u2019s TikTok would not change.  The spokesman also said GIFs have no online tracking mechanisms such as pixels or cookies, a concern for privacy advocates wary of Facebook\u2019s aggressive collection of personal data for use in targeted advertising.  The Federal Trade Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

REUTERS\/Carlos Jasso  Facebook said on Monday it would increase transparency through measures such as showing more information about the confirmed owner of a Facebook page and more prominently labeling content that independent fact-checkers have marked as false.  The social media giant has come under fire in recent weeks over its policy of exempting ads run by politicians from fact-checking, drawing ire from Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren.  Last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended the policy, saying social media had introduced transformative avenues for speech that should not be shut down.  That same day, the Biden campaign called for the removal of an ad run by a super PAC campaign group, not a politician, that it said contained false claims about the former vice president.  Katie Harbath, Facebook\u2019s head of global elections policy, said in response that if the now inactive ad ran again, it would be sent to Facebook\u2019s third-party fact-checkers.  On Monday, Facebook said would be putting into effect its planned ban on paid ads that tell people in the United States not to vote. Zuckerberg told reporters on a conference call that the ban on voter misinformation would also apply to ads run by politicians.  The company will start labeling state-controlled media on its page and in the site\u2019s ad library. In a blog post, Facebook said it planned to expand this labeling to specific posts on both Facebook and Instagram early next year.  Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, the video-streaming service of Alphabet\u2019s Google, all recently came under scrutiny after showing ads from Chinese state-controlled media that criticized Hong Kong protesters.  This month, the Senate committee investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election said that the Kremlin\u2019s best-known propaganda arm increased its social media activity after that vote.  \u201cThe bottom line here is that elections have changed significantly since 2016 and Facebook has changed too.\u201d Zuckerberg said on Monday.  \u201cWe face increasingly sophisticated attacks from nation states like Russia, Iran and China, but I\u2019m confident we\u2019re more prepared.\u201d  Theories that China has interfered in U.S. elections are absurd and laughable, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying at a regular press briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.  If someone says China interfered in the U.S. election, they should provide proof, said Hua. China has never had any interest in interfering with other countries\u2019 internal affairs, she said.  Moscow and Tehran have also repeatedly denied the allegations.  Facebook will introduce a new U.S. presidential candidate spend tracker to show how much they have spent on political ads as part of the company\u2019s efforts to make its ad library easier to use, Zuckerberg said.  Facebook launched an online library of political ads in 2018, but the database has been criticized by researchers as being poorly maintained and failing to provide useful ad targeting information.  The company plans to heighten protection of the Facebook and Instagram accounts of candidates, elected officials and their teams through a program called Facebook Protect. Participants in the program will be required to turn on two-factor authentication and their accounts will be monitored for signs of hacking.","1324":"(Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Democratic presidential campaign this week challenged Facebook\u2019s policy that exempts politicians\u2019 ads from fact-checking, by running ads on the social media platform containing the false claim that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg endorsed President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election bid.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  \u201cFacebook changed their ads policy to allow politicians to run ads with known lies - explicitly turning the platform into a disinformation-for-profit machine. This week, we decided to see just how far it goes.\u201d Warren tweeted on Saturday. \u201cWe intentionally made a Facebook ad with false claims.\u201d  Facebook Inc's FB.O policy has come under fire from another Democratic front-runner in the 2020 race. Former Vice President Joe Biden blasted Facebook after it refused to take down a Trump campaign ad that the Biden campaign said contained false allegations.  The Trump ad, which also ran on Twitter and YouTube, claimed that Biden had promised Ukraine $1 billion if the country fired a prosecutor investigating a company linked to Biden\u2019s son. Trump has repeatedly made allegations, without evidence, that Biden engaged in improper dealings in Ukraine.  In a letter to the Biden campaign, seen by Reuters, Facebook said that claims made in politicians\u2019 ads were considered their direct speech and therefore ineligible for its third-party fact-checking program.  \u201cOur approach is grounded in Facebook\u2019s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is,\u201d Facebook\u2019s head of global elections policy Katie Harbath wrote in the letter.  Both YouTube and Twitter told Reuters that the Trump campaign ad did not violate their policies.  The Warren campaign ads, some of which feature a photo of Zuckerberg and President Trump together, link to a petition supporting her plan to break up major tech companies such as Facebook, Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, on antitrust grounds.  \u201cBreaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election,\u201d one ad reads. \u201cYou\u2019re probably shocked, and you might be thinking, \u2018how could this possibly be true?\u2019 Well it\u2019s not. (Sorry.) But what Zuckerberg *has* done is given Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform -- and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.\u201d  Warren also attacked the policy in tweets earlier this week..  In response to the Warren campaign ad, Trump campaign spokesman Gary Coby tweeted: \u201cEveryone knows Warren has lied to help her career. Now she\u2019s using a blatant lie (Zuck endorsement) as a straw man argument to restrict #FreeSpeech.\u201d  Facebook said on Saturday that the Federal Communications Commission does not want broadcast companies to censor candidates\u2019 speech and that the social media company agreed with FCC\u2019s view on the subject.  \u201cWe agree it\u2019s better to let voters\u2014not companies\u2014decide\u201d, Facebook said in a tweet.  Warren reiterated that Facebook should hold itself to standards set forth in the company\u2019s policy.  \u201cIt\u2019s up to you whether you take money to promote lies. You can be in the disinformation-for-profit business, or you can hold yourself to some standards. In fact, those standards were in your policy. Why the change\u201d, Warren urged Facebook in a tweet late on Saturday.  Last week, leaked audio was published from an internal Facebook meeting from July in which Zuckerberg could be heard telling staff the company would fight Warren\u2019s proposal to split up Facebook if she were elected president.","1325":"FILE PHOTO: People are silhouetted as they pose with mobile devices in front of a screen projected with a Facebook logo, in this picture illustration taken in Zenica October 29, 2014.

Facebook\u2019s shares plunged 19 percent on Thursday - leading to the biggest one-day wipeout in value terms in U.S. stock market history - after the company said it faced a multi-year squeeze on its business margins.  But flow data covering the week to 25 July showed little drop in demand as investors continued to hunt for returns after a decade of quantitative easing, BAML said.  Funds investing in technology have pulled in $36 billion this year, the data showed, by far the largest on record.  Facebook's shock results were a \"classic late-cycle event,\" analysts at the bank wrote, calling investors' preference for FAANG stocks - the quintet of Facebook, Amazon AMZN.O, Apple AAPL.O, Netflix NFLX.O and Google GOOGL.O - \"the most crowded QE trade in the world\".  In contrast, the Chinese government\u2019s increasing wariness over a trade war with the U.S. provided an ideal entry point into emerging markets, particularly the BRIC nations of Brazil, Russia, India and China, BAML said.  In the last three months China has cut its Reserve Requirement Ratios twice, devalued the yuan CNY= by 7 percent, as well as widespread tax cuts and local bond issuance - all possible signs it is worried about global trade.  \u201cMarkets stop panicking when policy makers panic,\u201d analysts at BAML said, saying long BRICs against short FAANGs was a good trade for the third quarter.

The latest action comes as the company faces severe criticism from lawmakers and regulators over its privacy practices. Last month, Facebook agreed to a record-setting $5 billion privacy settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

In the quarter ended June 30, Facebook made nearly $17 billion from ad sales.  The social network said if a user clears their Off-Facebook Activity, it would remove the user\u2019s information from the data that apps and websites choose to send.  \u201cThe question remains as to how many consumers will actually bother to use this functionality, especially given it will require navigating into the app\u2019s Settings area,\u201d Cordwell said.  \u201cI think the impact from this new functionality will also be manageable for the business.\u201d","1328":"BRUSSELS, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Facebook has blocked people in Australia from accessing and sharing news content in a dispute with the government that would require it to share revenue from news.  Jurisdictions around the world have been enacting rules to require Google, Facebook and others to share revenue with publishers, including a 2019 directive from Brussels which European Union countries are meant to enact into law by June.  So is the EU likely to face a Facebook news ban similar to the one imposed in Australia? No. Here are some reasons why:  EU COPYRIGHT RULES  Approved in 2019 to help Europe\u2019s creative industries get a fair share of revenues, the EU\u2019s copyright rules require Google and other online platforms to sign licensing agreements with musicians, performers, authors, news publishers and journalists to use their work.  The rules do not force online platforms to pay for links posted by publishers to their news site, the main grievance for Facebook with the Australian government.  In France, which was among the first EU countries to implement the new rules, news publishers have already struck a deal with Google which the European Commission, the EU executive, says is a clear sign that the copyright rules are effective in levelling the playing field.  Australia\u2019s so-called Media Bargaining Code is based on Australian competition laws, underlining a tougher approach than the EU.  FACEBOOK NEWS  Facebook sought to defuse pressure from news publishers last month by launching Facebook News in Britain and signing up new partners Channel 4 News, Daily Mail Group, DC Thomson, Financial Times, Sky News and Telegraph Media Group on top of other news outlets.  It is now seeking to enlist French and German media companies before rolling out the service in these two countries.  EUROPEAN MEDIA GROUPS  European media groups, part of the driving force behind the EU copyright rules, do not have the same clout and geographical scope as News Corp, which struck a global agreement with Google on Wednesday.  Large companies such as Germany\u2019s Bertelsmann and French group Vivendi mainly dominate in their national markets because of linguistic and cultural differences across the bloc.

The FTC voted 3-2 along party lines to adopt the settlement, which requires court approval, even as Democrats said the settlement did not go far enough or require a large enough fine.  \u201cDespite repeated promises to its billions of users worldwide that they could control how personal information is shared Facebook undermined consumers\u2019 choices,\u201d said FTC Chairman Joe Simons, a Republican, in a statement.

The FTC said that Facebook\u2019s data policy was deceptive to \u201ctens of millions\u201d of people who used Facebook\u2019s facial recognition tool and also violated its rules against deceptive practices when it did not disclose phone numbers collected to enable a security feature would be used for advertising.  Under the settlement, Facebook\u2019s board will create an independent privacy committee that removes \u201cunfettered control by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg over decisions affecting user privacy.\u201d  Facebook also agreed to exercise greater oversight over third-party apps.  Chopra and Democratic FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, who opposed the settlement, said the $5 billion penalty may be less than Facebook\u2019s gains from violating users\u2019 privacy.  \u201cUntil we address Facebook\u2019s core financial incentives for risking our personal privacy and national security, we will not be able to prevent these problems from happening again,\u201d Chopra said.  The FTC Republican majority argued the settlement \u201csignificantly diminishes Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s power -- something no government agency, anywhere in the world, has thus far accomplished.\u201d  The Republican commissioners led by Simons said if the FTC had gone to court \u201cit is highly unlikely that any judge would have imposed a civil penalty even remotely close to this one.\u201d  They called the settlement -- in light of what the FTC might have been able to win in a court fight -- \u201ca complete home run.\u201d  The Republican majority noted that Zuckerberg and other company executives will have to sign quarterly certifications attesting to the company\u2019s privacy practices.  The FTC said Zuckerberg or others filing a false certification could face civil and criminal penalties.  Facebook also is barred from asking for email passwords to other services when consumers sign up.  Facebook is barred from using telephone numbers obtained in a security feature, like two-factor authentication, for advertising and must get user consent if it plans to use data from facial recognition technology.  FTC DECIDED TO SETTLE PROBE  The settlement stems from the company\u2019s alleged violations of a 2012 FTC settlement order over privacy issues.

Slaughter also criticized the FTC\u2019s decision to grant Facebook and its executives a release from liability for any claims that prior to June 12, 2019 it violated the FTC 2012 settlement as \u201cfar too broad\u201d and said the FTC failed \u201cto impose any substantive restrictions on Facebook\u2019s collection and use of data from or about users.\u201d  Chopra added that by \u201csettling the commission -- and the public -- may never find out what Facebook knows... It is difficult to conclude that the commission got the better end of the bargain.\u201d  The FTC has been investigating allegations Facebook inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.  The FTC also said Wednesday that Cambridge\u2019s former CEO Alexander Nix and former app developer Aleksandr Kogan, who worked with the company, had agreed to a settlement with the FTC that will restrict how they conduct business in the future.

The \u201cRoyalist Marketplace\u201d group, which had over 1 million members, was blocked within Thailand late on Monday after the digital ministry threatened legal action against Facebook under the country\u2019s Computer Crime Act.  Facebook said it was compelled to comply but would mount a legal challenge to the Thai government.  The tension came amid near daily youth-led protests against the government of a former military junta chief and unprecedented calls for reforms of the monarchy, which is illegal to insult in Thailand.  Hours before the restriction, Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a self-exiled academic and prominent critic of the monarchy, set up a new group with a similar name that has gained over half a million members in one day.  \u201cIf you want to close it down again, then I\u2019ll set up another group.

The board, which the world\u2019s largest social network created in response to criticism of its handling of problematic content, is open for cases both from users who have exhausted the company\u2019s appeals process and from Facebook itself.  However, Facebook has said the board is unlikely to handle cases related to the upcoming U.S. election, an event around which social media companies\u2019 content decisions are under scrutiny. Brent Harris, Facebook\u2019s director of governance and global affairs, told reporters on a call on Thursday that the company would not submit a case for expedited review before the Nov. 3 vote.  The board, a concept that Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg first publicly floated in 2018, announced its first 20 members in May. They include a former prime minister, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and several law experts and rights advocates.  Global users can submit appeals through the board\u2019s website in the 15 days after Facebook contacts them about its final content decision, though this option will be gradually rolled out over the coming weeks.  A board spokesman told Reuters last month the coronavirus pandemic had contributed to delays since last year in launching the board.  The board, which will only be able to review a small slice of Facebook and Instagram content, said it would share details on its first cases in the coming weeks and open a public comment process. A maximum of 90 days is given for the board to reach case decisions and for Facebook to act on them.  Emi Palmor, an oversight board member and former director general of the Israeli Ministry of Justice, said in an interview that the board may recommend policy changes that would affect Facebook\u2019s features, and how the company distributes content or makes money from it.  \u201cWe are not concerned with Facebook as a company that wants to make money,\u201d she said.  Palmor said the board needs to gain public trust in order to put pressure on Facebook to respect its policy recommendations as well as binding content decisions.  Facebook, which can refer cases on content left up or taken down on the site and on issues like ads or Facebook groups, began the process of selecting its cases for referral earlier this week, Harris said.  Palmor said the board, which is expected to grow to about 40 people, would also \u201cimmediately\u201d start work to select its next members.  The board, which has been criticized for its limited scope, aims to be able to hear cases from users about content that has been left up, as well as taken down, starting in early 2021, the board\u2019s director of administration Thomas Hughes said.  In September Facebook critics, including the organizers of a social media advertising boycott, launched a rival group to review the company\u2019s content moderation, which they dubbed the \u201cReal Facebook Oversight Board.\u201d  Facebook has committed an initial $130 million to an irrevocable trust to fund the board.","1336":"(Refiles to add date in 4th paragraph)  April 24 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc beat analysts\u2019 estimates for quarterly revenue on Wednesday, aided by growth in its Instagram business and a surge in advertising spending by companies while also warning it could face up to $5 billion in losses related to an official U.S. privacy investigation.

Both the FTC and groups of state attorneys general are widely believed to be planning litigation against Facebook for breaking antitrust law.  In her letter to FTC Chairman Joe Simons, Blackburn referred to an FTC deposition of Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, adding: \u201cWhile that is promising, I encourage you to also speak to other Facebook executives and engineers who can reveal the company\u2019s real agenda. Many of them fear letting Facebook\u2019s dominance go unchecked can hold dark consequences for competitors and consumers alike.\u201d  Blackburn specifically urged the FTC to interview such Facebook critics as company co-founder Chris Hughes, former chief security officer Alex Stamos and Yael Eisenstat, former head of Facebook\u2019s elections integrity effort.  Blackburn said that internet regulation, which is something Congress would take up, was not sufficient. \u201cAmericans depend on the commission to stand up to Facebook and to fully prosecute entities that violate the Sherman Antitrust Act,\u201d she wrote.  Pursuing the tech giants -- the Justice Department sued Alphabet\u2019s Google last month while Amazon and Apple remain under investigation -- is one thing that Democrats and Republicans have agreed on despite a polarized political atmosphere.  Senator Elizabeth Warren, a progressive Democrat, has urged that Facebook be required to sell Instagram, which it bought in 2012, and WhatsApp, which it bought in 2014.","1338":"(Adds dropped word in paragraph 4)  SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Facebook will not announce the first members of its independent oversight board this year as it originally expected, the company said on Thursday.  The new board will be able to make final decisions on whether individual pieces of content - such as a sensitive video or ad - should be displayed on the site, even overruling Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg.  The board is one of Facebook\u2019s high-profile efforts to respond to criticism over how it handles problematic content and transparency around its decision-making.  However, the board\u2019s creation is behind schedule, the company confirmed in a blog post. It will now probably not name the board\u2019s co-chairs and first members until after January 2020.  Brent Harris, Facebook\u2019s head of governance and global affairs, said the delays were due to both the unforeseen complexities of creating a trust to ensure the board\u2019s independence and to the task of whittling down more than 1,000 nominees to no more than about 40 people.  \u201cThis is not a \u2018move fast and break things\u2019 project,\u201d Harris told Reuters in a phone interview, referring to the social media network\u2019s early motto.  He said that the recommended members had come through Facebook\u2019s global consultation process in 88 countries, as well as the company\u2019s public online portal, which opened in September.  They range from \u201cformer heads of state to Nobel Prize winners to people who moderate groups on Facebook to local judges,\u201d Harris said.  Facebook now plans to announce the board\u2019s co-chairs, of which Harris said there would likely be three, and a first set of about 20 members after January.  Both Facebook and its users can submit cases to the board, and while the board cannot make policy, Facebook will be required to respond publicly to any recommendations it makes.  Facebook, which released an updated charter for the board in September, plans to recommend its bylaws in January. These will help create operating procedures, such as the process by which cases are selected.  In a Thursday blog post, Facebook also said it had made an initial commitment of $130 million to the new trust, to cover operational costs for at least six years.  \u201cThe board is an actual institution; it\u2019s almost like its own start-up and it needs all the things that new institutions need\u201d such as a legal team and recruiting mechanisms, said Heather Moore, a member of the Facebook team who developed the board\u2019s charter.  The company on Thursday also released the results of an assessment on the human rights impacts of content decisions by the board. (Reporting by Elizabeth Culliford.

The world\u2019s biggest social media company is poised to reap a windfall from that gambit, analysts say, bolstered by a return in ad growth rates to pre-COVID levels and a holiday shopping boost from its new \u201csocial commerce\u201d features.  Wall Street expects the company to report fourth-quarter sales up 25% to $26.4 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Investors will also look for guidance on the company\u2019s plans to integrate messaging across its suite of apps and introduce shopping into Reels, a short-video product inside Instagram intended to compete with TikTok, they said.  Still, Facebook is likely to face questions around U.S. antitrust complaints, privacy changes in Apple Inc\u2019s latest iOS update and Facebook\u2019s role in recent Capitol protests, as well as the business impact of its decision to suspend former U.S. President Donald Trump.

The videoconferencing tool, Messenger Rooms, will enable as many as 50 people to participate in a call, the company said in a statement. It will display a tiled layout of participant videos - up to 16 on desktop and 8 on mobile - resembling the design offered by competitor Zoom.  Facebook users will be able to share links enabling non-users to join Rooms via a web browser on both desktop and mobile, eliminating requirements to download an app or create an account as on other services.  There will be no time limits on the calls.  With the launch, Facebook joins a crowded field of companies rushing to dominate the market for video meetings, as millions of people locked in their homes around the world are suddenly reliant on the tools for work, school and social life.  Elements of the product had been slated for release in the third and fourth quarters of the year, but Facebook accelerated its plans after observing a spike in group calling during the lockdowns, Head of Messenger Stan Chudnovsky told Reuters.  \u201cOur video calls doubled, and when we\u2019re looking at the group calls usage, that went up even higher,\u201d said Chudnovsky. \u201cSo we figured out a way to build those things faster.\u201d  Facebook said in its statement there were now more than 700 million accounts participating in calls on WhatsApp and Messenger each day.  Microsoft Corp, Zoom Video Communications, Cisco Systems Inc and Alphabet\u2019s Google also have rolled out updates of their video meeting tools while reporting record growth since the lockdowns began.  On Tuesday, Microsoft introduced a new \u201cMeet Now\u201d for Skype that can accommodate video meetings of up to 50 people without downloading any apps. Google, whose Meet tool for businesses has been its fastest-growing service this year, said this month that it was working on enhancements for consumers too.  PREEMINENCE OF MESSENGER  Chudnovsky said Facebook\u2019s free offering is focused squarely on the consumer market with Messenger Rooms and is not currently making overtures to businesses, the main source of revenue for most other videoconferencing apps.  The company is simultaneously expanding its livestreaming offerings, such as an option to add a guest to a live video on the core Facebook app and the ability to save live videos on Instagram to the IGTV video-sharing app.  Its decision to build Rooms on Messenger\u2019s infrastructure asserts the app\u2019s preeminence as the company begins to realize Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s vision to weave together its messaging services, offering a first glimpse at how that integration will be structured.  Messenger Rooms will be accessible across the social network\u2019s sprawling array of online gathering spaces, enabling users to jump into group video meetings directly from News Feed as well as in Groups and Events pages.  Facebook is also planning to add buttons within messaging service WhatsApp and the chat function of Instagram, although those users will be prompted to open Messenger to create Rooms, said Chudnovsky.  The company is simultaneously expanding group video calling within WhatsApp, which has more users than Messenger, but is capping the number of participants there at eight people.  Chudnovsky said Zuckerberg\u2019s plan to extend end-to-end encryption across messaging services would also apply to Messenger Rooms. \u201cWe would like to have it all encrypted if possible,\u201d he said.  The encryption plan is lauded by privacy advocates but has met stiff resistance in Washington, where lawmakers warn it could hinder the fight against child abuse and other illegal activities.

And the so-called altcoins have fared even worse.  The second-biggest coin Ethereum ETH=BTSP has slumped by nearly half. The third largest, Ripple's XRP XRP=BTSP, is down by around 40%, while Litecoin LTC=BTSP and Bitcoin Cash BCH=BTSP have slumped by 40% and 42% respectively.

FILE PHOTO: Small toy figures are seen in front of Google logo in this illustration picture, April 8, 2019. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  The Justice Department has said it will investigate \u201cwhether and how\u201d online platforms in \u201csearch, social media, and some retail services online\u201d are engaging in behavior that stifles competition and harms consumers.  While the Justice Department did not name any targets in announcing the probe on Tuesday, sources have indicated Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, social media giant Facebook Inc, online retailer Amazon.com Inc and possibly Apple Inc will likely be reviewed.  Here\u2019s what regulators could focus on at the big technology companies:  GOOGLE  The Justice Department is expected to focus on allegations Google harms competitors by favoring its own products in search results, though sources told Reuters the department will look at all of Google\u2019s businesses, including advertising and its Android mobile platform.  Google has said it is transparent in how it promotes its own services and that changes to its search algorithms are made with consumers in mind.  Google has also faced criticism for allegedly abusing its dominance in advertising. Platforms that want to host advertising on their own sites often have to go through Google or Facebook to do so.  European antitrust regulators fined Google $5 billion in 2018 and ordered it to stop using its Android platform to block competitors. The European Union alleged that Google\u2019s illegal actions include forcing device manufacturers, who use the Android platform on their phones, to pre-install Google apps on devices, blocking out competitors\u2019 apps.  Google said in a blog post that it would \u201cdo more to ensure\u201d that Android users know about other options they can download.  Republican U.S. lawmakers have also charged that Google and other tech companies are biased against conservative voices. Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in April that \u201cusing the powers of monopoly to censor political speech ... raises real antitrust issues.\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Karan Bhatia, Google\u2019s vice president of government affairs and public policy, denied those claims in a Fox News op-ed and Democrats say there is no evidence to back the charges.  FACEBOOK  Facebook has faced criticism it is a monopoly, with over 2.4 billion monthly users as of April this year, about a third of the world\u2019s population.  In 2012, Facebook bought social media app Instagram, one of its competitors. In 2014, it bought another of its competitors, messaging platform WhatsApp.  In a U.S. House of Representatives hearing last week, Facebook\u2019s head of global policy development Matt Perault stressed Facebook\u2019s competitors as evidence it is not a monopoly.  Critics have called for Facebook to sell off WhatsApp and Instagram.  The company has also been criticized for copying the \u201cstory\u201d function that competitor Snapchat is known for, implementing the option to share a photo temporarily on both Facebook and Instagram.  Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  AMAZON  In the United States, half of all online shopping transactions happen on Amazon, giving the e-commerce company sway over merchants that use its platforms. Amazon has been criticized for its power over third-party sellers on its website, who must pay for advertising to compete against first-party and private label sales by Amazon\u2019s own brands.  Amazon has also faced criticism that its low prices have hurt brick-and-mortar retailers, including some who have closed because they could not compete.  But in a 2018 letter to shareholders, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos said \u201cAmazon remains a small player in global retail\u201d because most commerce still happens offline.  Amazon reached an agreement with German antitrust authorities last week to change its agreement with third-party merchants following an investigation of complaints from the sellers that its terms were unfair.  European Union regulators are investigating Amazon\u2019s data agreements with sellers. The European Commission has been seeking feedback about Amazon\u2019s dual role as a marketplace for merchants and as a competitor in that marketplace.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday there was \u201cno question\u201d that Amazon limits competition and has harmed U.S. retailers.  In response, an Amazon spokesman said small businesses are \u201cthriving with Amazon\u201d and that independent sellers make up more than 58% of its gross merchandise sales.  APPLE  Last month, app developers Donald R. Cameron and Illinois Pure Sweat Basketball alleged in federal court that Apple\u2019s policy of only allowing the downloading of iPhone apps through its official App Store is anticompetitive. Apple mandates developers to price apps in tiers ending in 99 cents and takes up to a 30% commission from developers on app sales.  Music-streaming app Spotify has alleged that App Store policies make it difficult to compete against Apple Music for paid subscribers.  Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told CBS News in an interview that Apple does not have a dominant position in any market.","1348":"Posts on Facebook showing a graph plotting daily new coronavirus cases along with the claim that \u201cmask mandates may have actually spread COVID-19.\u201d This claim is false.

REUTERS  Examples of posts making this claim can be found here , here , and here .  Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said in an Oct. 28 interview with CNBC\u2019s Shepard Smith that he supported a national mask mandate (here) .  On Nov. 10, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that \u201cexperimental and epidemiological data support community masking to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2\" and that \u201cthe prevention benefit of masking is derived from the combination of source control and personal protection for the mask wearer\u201d (here) .

On its website (swprs.org\/), Swiss Policy Research describes itself as \u201can independent, nonpartisan and nonprofit research group investigating geopolitical propaganda in Swiss and international media.\u201d  When reached by Reuters for comment, Swiss Policy Research said that the social media posts misrepresented their analysis and that they \u201cdo not claim or suggest that masks increase cases, nor do we suggest people shouldn\u2019t wear masks.\u201d  French President Emmanuel Macron announced on July 14 that masks would be required in enclosed public spaces because of concerns about renewed flare-ups of COVID-19 (here). It is also true that recorded daily new cases in France have been climbing since late this summer (here). The correlation in timing, however, does not indicate causation.  The social media posts\u2019 claim that wearing masks contributes to the spread of COVID-19 contradicts the findings of several scientific studies. For example, a study published by the University of Kansas on Oct. 25 (here) found that Kansas counties with mask mandates avoided a major surge in COVID-19 infections, while counties without such requirements saw a steady climb (here) .  Meanwhile, an Oct. 27 analysis from Vanderbilt University School of Medicine (here) found that Tennessee COVID-19 hospitalizations have been rising at a much lower rate in areas that have mask mandates than in those that do not.  On the national scale, the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) has projected that if 95% of U.S. residents wore masks in public, an additional 129,574 lives could be saved between Sept. 22, 2020 and the end of February 2021 (here) .  A study published by Duke University in September found that of the 14 different kinds of face coverings it tested, a fitted N95 surgical mask provided the most effective protection against respiratory droplets while a neck gaiter proved least effective ( here ). Cotton masks did result in lower droplet transmission than not wearing a mask (see Fig. 3).  After a national lockdown was effective at containing the epidemic in France, the virus started spreading again after rules were relaxed starting May 11 ( here ). On Oct. 17, France reported 523 new deaths from coronavirus over the previous 24 hours, the highest daily toll since April, when the virus was at its most severe.  In anticipating of a second wave of the respiratory disease, France has been back in lockdown since Oct. 30. Less stringent than in March, the latest restrictions have succeeded in lowering daily new infections and eased pressure on the French health system. The number of people hospitalized for COVID-19 sharply declined for a third day running on Nov. 19 (here).  As a new wave of the pandemic washes over parts of the Northern Hemisphere, many countries are setting records for infections. In the United States, the number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 has jumped nearly 50% in the past two weeks (here).  With the third coronavirus wave bringing a fresh surge in infections and putting immense strain on the healthcare system, the United States has continued to set records for daily coronavirus infections, with more than 187,000 cases reported on Nov. 19 ( here , here ).  As stated by Vox here, more testing for COVID-19 cannot be \u201cthe full explanation\u201d for the surge \u201cbecause hospitalizations (here) and the overall rate of positive tests (here) are trending up.\u201d  The New York Times explains that the latest surge has come \u201cas cooler weather is forcing people indoors and as many Americans report feeling exhausted by months of restrictions.

The meeting comes after Reuters and other outlets reported on Sept. 25 that the Justice Department would open an antitrust investigation into Facebook, which also faces probes by the Federal Trade Commission and the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee.  The state attorneys general probe into Facebook, announced in September, is being led by New York and also includes Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and the District of Columbia.  The meeting also included Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and antitrust assistant attorney general Makan Delrahim, the sources said. Facebook declined to comment, but Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg told employees he expected the company would be able to defeat a legal challenge to breakup the company.  Axios reported the plans for the meeting earlier.  James said in September that the states\u2019 investigation would look into whether Facebook\u2019s actions had endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers\u2019 choices or increased the price of advertising.  Facebook, which owns one-time rivals Instagram and WhatsApp and has 2.4 billion monthly users, agreed in July to pay a $5-billion FTC settlement for various privacy violations.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Brussels gave internet firms three months in March to show they were acting faster to take down radical posts. Industry lobby groups said they have made great strides since then, but the Commission decided that progress had been insufficient.  If authorities flag it, the European Commission wants content inciting or advocating extremist offences, promoting extremist groups, or showing how to commit such acts to be removed from the web within a hour.  \u201cOne hour is the decisive time window in which the greatest damage takes place,\u201d Jean-Claude Juncker said in his annual State of the Union address to the European Parliament.  In a proposal that will need backing from EU countries and the European Parliament, internet platforms will also be required to take proactive measures, such as developing new tools to weed out abuse and human oversight of content.  Service providers will have to provide annual transparency reports to show their efforts in tackling abuse.  Providers systematically failing to remove extremist content could face hefty fines of up to 4 percent of annual global turnover.  \u201cWe need strong and targeted tools to win this online battle,\u201d Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova said.  In turn, the draft rules will demand the EU\u2019s 28 national governments put in place the capacity to identify extremist content online, sanctions and an appeals procedure.  The industry has also been working since December 2015 in a voluntary partnership to stop the misuse of the internet by international extremist groups, later creating a \u201cdatabase of hashes\u201d to better detect extremist content.  Firms increasingly rely on a mix of machine learning, artificial intelligence and human moderators to spot and delete extremist content.  YouTube said it shared the Commission\u2019s desire to react rapidly and keep violent extremism off the internet. It said it had invested heavily to do so and would continue to engage closely with the Commission, EU countries and law enforcement agencies.  Facebook said in a statement that it had made significant strides finding and removing their propaganda \u201cbut we know we can do more\u201d.  When content is taken down from one platform, it often crops up on another - straining authorities\u2019 ability to police the web.  Smaller platforms, industry insiders warn, may not have the same resources to comply as speedily with tougher EU rules.

NEW YORK, March 21 (Reuters) - The first of what\u2019s likely to be a string of suits by investors accusing Facebook of fraudulently concealing unauthorized data harvesting was filed late Tuesday in federal court in San Francisco.  The class action complaint alleges that since at least February 2017, Facebook failed to disclose in public securities filings that the company allowed outside firms such as Cambridge Analytica to access the personal data of millions of unwitting Facebook users.  Over the past few days, the New York Times\u2019 disclosure of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s extensive access to Facebook data and subsequent reporting on regulatory fallout led to a drop in share price from a high of about $185 on Monday to $164.83 at the close of trading on Tuesday.  The complaint also cites a previous stock drop, in May 2017, when France\u2019s Commission on Informatics and Liberty fined Facebook about $230,000 (then the maximum) for failing to block advertisers\u2019 access to user data.  \u201cTHIS IS A WINNER\u201d  The class action was filed by an individual investor, Fan Yuan, who is represented by the shareholder class action firm Pomerantz. That doesn\u2019t mean Yuan or Pomerantz will end up running the case. Under the rules for securities class action, other Facebook investors now have 60 days to decide if they want to compete with Yuan to be named lead plaintiff in an appointment process that typically favors institutional investors.  Several plaintiffs\u2019 firms have issued press releases urging Facebook investors to contact them, a standard practice in securities class action litigation. Pomerantz co-managing partner Jeremy Lieberman said his firm is consulting with its pension fund clients to gauge their intentions.  \u201cEveryone knows this is a winner,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cThis is a snowballing issue for Facebook. It\u2019s only going to get worse as more facts come out.\u201d  Perhaps. Facebook didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment from my Reuters colleague Jon Stempel on the securities class action and a related privacy breach class action filed in the same court. Facebook deputy general counsel has said in response to the Cambridge disclosures that the company is \u201ccommitted to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people\u2019s information (and) will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.\u201d  INTENTIONAL DECEPTION?  Investors will have to show Facebook officials knowingly deceived them about advertisers\u2019 ability to access user data \u2013 an assertion the company continues to deny. According to a March 16 blog post from Facebook, Cambridge obtained access, via an app developed by a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge, only to information from consenting users, in keeping with its security policies. The company insists it was the professor who violated Facebook policies by sharing the data he obtained with Cambridge Analytica, which compounded the violation by refusing to delete the information.  Obviously, the facts of Facebook\u2019s relationship with the Cambridge professor and Cambridge Analytica will have to be uncovered \u2013 possibly through congressional testimony or an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, which previously obtained a consent decree from the company \u2013 before we can realistically assess whether Facebook misrepresented its privacy policies to shareholders.  If it turns out Facebook was allowing advertisers to access user data without their consent, that March 16 blog post will surely feature in shareholders\u2019 amended complaint.  BREAKTHROUGH RULING  For years, corporate defendants in data breach class actions have managed to squelch class actions by investors alleging misrepresentations about the security of users\u2019 personal information. But a milestone settlement earlier this month may portend bigger exposure for defendants like Facebook.  On March 2, Altaba (formerly Yahoo) agreed to pay $80 million to settle a securities class action by Yahoo investors who had accused the company of failing to disclose hacks that left users vulnerable to identity theft. As securities law expert Kevin LaCroix pointed out in a blog post about the Yahoo settlement, it seemed to mark a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d for plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers who had struggled to find a way to win securities class actions based on data disclosure.  After the Yahoo settlement, LaCroix predicted, shareholder lawyers would sense opportunity when companies\u2019 share prices dropped significantly in response to reports of data misuse.  The Facebook case seems to bear out LaCroix\u2019s prediction \u2013 and it\u2019s worth noting that Pomerantz, the firm that filed the first Facebook case, was lead counsel in Yahoo.","1356":"SYDNEY, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Australia will continue to have talks with Facebook Inc on the proposed news payment law, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said on Thursday, after the social media giant blocked content from being read and shared in its news feed in the country.  \u201cThis morning, I had a constructive discussion with Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook... we agreed to continue our conversation to try to find a pathway forward,\u201d Frydenberg said in a tweet, referring to Facebook\u2019s chief executive.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  France and Germany have said that Libra, whose size would dwarf cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, could limit their monetary sovereignty.  \u201cEurope needs a common approach on crypto-assets such as Libra,\u201d Valdis Dombrovskis told EU lawmakers in a confirmation hearing. \u201cI intend to propose new legislation on this.\u201d  The EU has no specific regulations on cryptocurrencies, which, until Libra was announced in June, had been considered a marginal issue by most decision-makers because only a fraction of bitcoins or other digital coins are converted into euros.  Dombrovskis has resisted regulating digital currencies in the five years he has served so far. He made it clear his change of heart stemmed from Facebook\u2019s plans for Libra, a digital currency that \u201ccould have systemic effects on financial stability,\u201d he told lawmakers.  The EU is now also pushing the G20 for global action on \u201cstablecoins,\u201d an EU document circulated last week said.  Facebook\u2019s planned Libra is the best-known of the stablecoins - cryptocurrencies backed by assets such as conventional money deposits, short-term government securities or gold.  Libra\u2019s scale would pose risks, Dombrovskis said, because Facebook\u2019s millions of users in Europe would be able to pay with the new digital currency.  An EU Commission official said there was no timetable yet for proposing the new rules.  Dombrovskis said the crypto regulation should focus on defending financial stability, protecting consumers and tackling the risks of money-laundering using crypto-assets, which can easily cross borders.  Dombrovskis, a former prime minister of Latvia, said the EU needed to rethink its defenses against financial crime. He also said he saw \u201ca lot of merit\u201d in shifting some supervision to an EU body, without clarifying whether that meant setting up a new anti-money-laundering agency or beefing up existing agencies.  In his address to lawmakers, Dombrovskis also pledged a \u201csustainable Europe investment plan\u201d to unlock 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) of private and public green investment over the next decade.  He said the plan would be based on guarantees and funds provided by the EU budget and the European Investment Bank, although most of the money is expected to come from the private sector.","1358":"(Updates to U.S. equity market open; changes dateline, previous LONDON)  * Gloom lifts off stocks after recent tech rout  * World shares set for first quarterly loss in 2 years  * Dollar steadies, Treasury yields move lower  By Trevor Hunnicutt  NEW YORK, March 29 (Reuters) - Riskier assets such as stocks steadied on Thursday, after a woeful week for giant technology companies, even as global equities careened towards their first quarterly drop in two years.  Stock indexes tracked by the 47-country MSCI index glided 0.61 percent higher, as trading opened in New York with Facebook Inc, Apple Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc retaking the market\u2019s leadership mantle.  On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 239.46 points, or 1 percent, to 24,087.88, the S&P 500 gained 25.23 points, or 0.97 percent, to 2,630.23 and the Nasdaq Composite added 68.75 points, or 0.99 percent, to 7,017.98.  Despite the equity gains, safe-haven bonds also advanced in price. The U.S. dollar weakened, stalling its sharp rise.  The turbulent start to 2018 in financial markets has brought an end to one of the longest quarterly bull runs, and there have been few places to hide.  Investors have faced the biggest ever rise in stock volatility, rapidly escalating tensions over global trade, deepening turmoil in the White House and major wobbles in the tech sector.  A \u201cmelt-up\u201d that sent the MSCI\u2019s world share index up 8 percent in January suddenly melted away. Now, the Dow Jones, S&P 500, FTSE, Nikkei and scores of other major indexes are all down for the year.  \u201cWe have got to make sure (the market selloff) ...is not too prolonged because the longer this goes, the higher the chance it will start to affect the man in the street,\u201d said Roger Jones, the head of equities at London & Capital.  Facebook, Apple and some of their peers were hurt this quarter as investors rethought high U.S. stock valuations in light of the prospect of a U.S.-China trade war and potentially increased regulation of tech companies.  Reuters\u2019 monthly markets poll showed the trade war and tech sector worries have spooked global investors into cutting their equity exposure to a four-month low and holdings of U.S. stocks to the lowest in nearly two years.  Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last rose in price to yield 2.7534 percent, from 2.775 percent late on Wednesday. That pushed the gap between U.S. short- and long-dated Treasuries to its tightest level in a decade. Some investors see a narrowing between those bonds\u2019 yields as a sign the economy will sputter.  For currency traders, the dollar settled too after a stronger-than-expected revision to U.S. fourth quarter economic growth data and hopes a nuclear standoff with North Korea has been averted gave it its largest daily gain in nearly seven months on Wednesday. An index of the greenback against its trading partners rose 0.08 percent.  A 45-year low in jobless claims helped the tentative return of risk appetite, and U.S. inflation data also cooled safety plays including Treasuries and German Bunds.  Oil managed a rebound despite data on Wednesday that showed a surprise build in U.S. crude stockpiles. U.S. crude rose 0.62 percent to $64.78 per barrel and Brent was last at $69.11, up 0.51 percent on the day.  In Asia, Japan\u2019s Nikkei rose 0.6 percent, while Shanghai closed up 1.2 percent and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng recovered from an early wobble to add 0.3 percent.

FILE PHOTO: Small toy figures are seen on representations of virtual currency in front of the Libra logo in this illustration picture, June 21, 2019. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  Facebook in mid-June announced plans to launch Libra next year as it expands to e-commerce and digital payments. Since then, it has faced scrutiny by politicians, regulators and central bankers around the globe, including over fear that widespread adoption by Facebook\u2019s 2.38 billion users could disrupt the financial system and facilitate money laundering.  David Marcus, who oversees Facebook\u2019s currency project, said at a U.S. Senate hearing earlier this month he expected the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) to be Libra\u2019s privacy regulator. This is because the nonprofit Libra Association, which Facebook had set up to oversee the currency, is based in Geneva.  In a statement, the FDPIC said it sent a letter to the association on July 17 because it had not yet heard from the group about the project.  Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Among other things, the Swiss data privacy authority said it was expecting Libra to conduct an impact assessment of data protection risks associated with the cryptocurrency, evaluate risks and propose measures to minimize them.  \u201cThe FDPIC stated in its letter that as it had not received any indication on what personal data may be processed, the Libra Association should inform it of the current status of the project so that the FDPIC could assess the extent to which its advisory competences and supervisory powers would apply,\u201d the watchdog said.  \u201cThe FDPIC is currently waiting for the Libra Association to respond to (its) letter of 17 July 2019 and set out their official position.\u201d  Marcus had told the U.S. Senate that the association has held talks with the Swiss Financial Markets Supervisory Authority on \u201can appropriate regulatory framework.\u201d  Facebook\u2019s handling of data privacy has been the focus of criticism, and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is set to announce the company\u2019s sweeping settlement of allegations it mishandled user privacy and would pay $5 billion, two people briefed on the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.","1360":"A 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen in front of the logo of the European Union in this picture illustration made in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina on May 15, 2015.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The case, which was initially brought against Facebook by Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems, is the latest to question whether methods used by technology firms to transfer data outside the 28-nation European Union give EU consumers sufficient protection from U.S. surveillance.  A ruling by Europe\u2019s top court against the current legal arrangements would have major implications for thousands of companies, which make millions of such transfers every day, including human resources databases, credit card transactions and storage of internet browsing histories.  The Irish High Court, which heard Schrems\u2019 case against Facebook last year, said there were well-founded concerns about an absence of an effective remedy in U.S. law compatible with EU legal requirements, which prohibit personal data being transferred to a country with inadequate privacy protections.  The High Court ordered the case be referred to the ECJ to assess whether the methods used for data transfers - including standard contractual clauses and the so called Privacy Shield agreement - were legal.  Facebook took the case to the Supreme Court when the High Court refused its request to appeal the referral, but in a unanimous decision on Friday, the Supreme Court said it would not overturn any aspect the ruling.  The High Court\u2019s original five-page referral asks the ECJ if the Privacy Shield - under which companies certify they comply with EU privacy law when transferring data to the United States - does in fact mean that the United States \u201censures an adequate level of protection\u201d.  Facebook came under scrutiny last year after it emerged the personal information of up to 87 million users, mostly in the United States, may have been improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.  More generally, data privacy has been a growing public concern since revelations in 2013 by former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden of mass U.S. surveillance caused political outrage in Europe.  The Privacy Shield was hammered out between the EU and the United States after the ECJ struck down its predecessor, Safe Harbour, on the grounds that it did not afford Europeans\u2019 data enough protection from U.S. surveillance.  That case was also brought by Schrems via the Irish courts.  \u201cFacebook likely again invested millions to stop this case from progressing. It is good to see that the Supreme Court has not followed,\u201d Schrems said in a statement.","1362":"May 23 (Reuters) - VATTENFALL:  * VATTENFALL AND FACEBOOK SIGN LONG-TERM DEALS FOR NEW NORDIC RENEWABLE ENERGY  * AGREEMENTS FOR INTEGRATING OUTPUT OF THREE NEW NORWEGIAN WIND PROJECTS INTO ELECTRIC GRID THAT PROVIDES POWER TO FACEBOOK\u2019S NORDIC DATA CENTRES Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Reporting By Stockholm newsroom)","1363":"FILE PHOTO: Federal Trade Commission seal is seen at a news conference to announce that Facebook Inc has agreed to a settlement of allegations it mishandled user privacy at FTC Headquarters in Washington, U.S., July 24, 2019.

Facebook has long courted business customers but is mostly identified with its consumer brands, including its social network, Messenger and WhatsApp. Workplace collaboration is a fast-growing area but rivals including Slack and Microsoft Teams already offer third-party app integrations as a way to entice and keep customers.  The market is projected to be worth $3.2 billion by research firm IDC and is fast becoming crowded with entrants that also include Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Cisco Systems Inc and Atlassian Corp Plc.  Facebook\u2019s Workplace product will gain a so-called Integration Directory of more than 50 software services including Microsoft Corp\u2019s SharePoint, SurveyMonkey and Atlassian\u2019s Jira, which helps developers manage projects and build software.  These workplace collaboration tools stand to serve as influential hubs from which office workers access the business software they use.  Facebook, which introduced Workplace in late 2016, claimed in October that more than 30,000 organizations use the product, including Match Group Inc, which owns Tinder, Farmers Insurance Group and Starbucks Corp. The company declined to provide recent figures or share how many organizations pay for the premium service. By comparison, Microsoft Teams is used by 200,000 organizations while Slack claims 50,000 paying organizations.  Still, worries about Facebook\u2019s management of private data on its consumer business are undermining interest in Workplace draws from corporations, analysts said.  \u201cCompanies, for now at least, are being more conscious around Workplace because of the lack of clarity around data usage that has plagued the parent brand,\u201d Wayne Kurtzman, an analyst with the research firm IDC, told Reuters.  With integrations, Workplace is also playing catch-up. Microsoft Teams claims 250 integrations while Slack\u2019s ecosystem stands at more than 1,000.  \u201cIt\u2019s a competitive market,\u201d said Alan Lepofsky, analyst with Constellation Research. Facebook\u2019s vice president of Workplace, Julien Codorniou, said that Facebook decided which apps to allow into the system.  \u201cWe think that making apps that people already use today work better together is more important than offering one thousand apps to our clients,\u201d Codorniou said, adding that Facebook and a third party were reviewing the apps for security.

At 11:25 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 20.46 points, or 0.08 percent, at 26,582.51, the S&P 500 was up 0.95 points, or 0.03 percent, at 2,920.32 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 6.89 points, or 0.09 percent, at 8,000.14.  The Fed\u2019s third hike this year would make cash the most attractive it has been in about a decade, lowering the appeal of stocks, especially those of dividend-paying companies such as utilities.  The utilities sector slid 1.06 percent, the most among the 11 major S&P sectors. Five sectors were posting gains.  Intel fell 1.8 percent after Raymond James downgraded the stock.  Nike was off 0.4 percent ahead of its quarterly results, expected after the bell.  CenturyLink tumbled 8.1 percent after Chief Financial Officer Sunit Patel left the company in a surprise move to join T-Mobile to oversee its integration with Sprint, both of which were little changed on the day.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.06-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.25-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.  The S&P index recorded 24 new 52-week highs and seven new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 47 new highs and 30 new lows.

The 3-0 decision from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco exposes Facebook to billions of dollars in potential damages to the Illinois users who brought the case.  It came as the social media company faces broad criticism from lawmakers and regulators over its privacy practices. Last month, Facebook agreed to pay a record $5 billion fine to settle a Federal Trade Commission data privacy probe.  \u201cThis biometric data is so sensitive that if it is compromised, there is simply no recourse,\u201d Shawn Williams, a lawyer for plaintiffs in the class action, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a Social security card or credit card number where you can change the number. You can\u2019t change your face.\u201d  Facebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The lawsuit began in 2015, when Illinois users accused Facebook of violating that state\u2019s Biometric Information Privacy Act by using facial recognition technology to collect biometric data.  Facebook allegedly accomplished this through its \u201cTag Suggestions\u201d feature, which allowed users to recognize their Facebook friends from previously uploaded photos.  Writing for the appeals court, Circuit Judge Sandra Ikuta said the Illinois users could sue as a group, rejecting Facebook\u2019s argument their claims were unique and required individual lawsuits.  She also said the 2008 Illinois law was intended to protect individuals\u2019 \u201cconcrete interests in privacy,\u201d and that Facebook\u2019s alleged unauthorized use of a face template \u201cinvades an individual\u2019s private affairs and concrete interests.\u201d  The appeals court returned the case to U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco, who had certified a class action in April 2018, for a possible trial unless Facebook successfully appeals.  Federal court procedures allowed the plaintiffs to sue Facebook in California though they called Illinois home.  Illinois\u2019 biometric privacy law provides for damages of $1,000 for each negligent violation and $5,000 for each intentional or reckless violation.  Williams, a partner at Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, said the class could include 7 million Facebook users.  The FTC probe arose from the discovery that Facebook had let British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica harvest users\u2019 personal information.

The Irish Independent newspaper quoted Dixon as saying on Friday that her office\u2019s first major GDPR decision relating to a multinational firm looked set to be one of two probes it opened into WhatsApp.  More than half of the DPC\u2019s multinational investigations relate to Facebook, eight directly focusing on the U.S. social media giant, plus the two into WhatsApp and one into Facebook-owned Instagram.  \u201cI expect that file to land on my desk in the next fortnight,\u201d Dixon told the newspaper in an interview.  \u201cI\u2019d like to say that we could do it in 48 hours, but it has to be in the order of months, to be done in the way that it has to be done.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  Local Alerts, which it has been testing since last year in 300 cities including Charlotte, St. Louis and Miami and now plans to offer across the United States, is intended to provide reliable information to people caught up in events such as mass shootings and extreme weather, it said in a blog post.  Alongside other social media companies, Facebook has faced a barrage of international criticism for the way its platform has been used to spread conspiracy theories and extremist views and it is keen to focus attention instead on its role as a connector of friends and family.  The world\u2019s largest social media network already offers users the ability to let friends know they are safe during emergencies with a feature called Safety Check, but said it wanted to do more.  With Local Alerts, Facebook account holders in local government and among first responders such as the police and fire departments can send out messages that are then spread more widely by Facebook.  It was not immediately clear how useful the service was in its pilot phase. When asked if Local Alerts to date have been deployed quickly enough to make a difference or have been employed in situations where users were in danger, Facebook declined to give examples, citing the privacy of its account holders.  It also said the speed at which alerts were disseminated was dependent on the account holders.  In one example, when a disgruntled student opened fire during the last day of classes at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in April, the City of Charlotte Government\u2019s Facebook page sent a Local Alert notifying nearby residents when it was safe to return.  The alert was posted more than two hours after the shooting, said Ken Brown, Charlotte\u2019s Interim Media Relations Manager.  Some local authorities contacted by Reuters said they were using Local Alerts alongside other services to warn citizens of danger. Mt. Juliet Police Department in Tennessee said it uses a combination of Facebook Local Alerts, mobile text messages through the Nixle platform, and posts on local community media service Nextdoor to send emergency notifications.

FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen placed on a keyboard in this illustration taken March 25, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  Facebook blocked all Australian news content on its service over proposed legislation requiring it and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google to pay fees to Australian publishers for news links.  Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault, in charge of crafting similar legislation to be unveiled in coming months, condemned Facebook\u2019s action and said it would not deter Ottawa.  \u201cCanada is at the forefront of this battle ... we are really among the first group of countries around the world that are doing this,\u201d he told reporters.  Last year, Canadian media organizations warned of a potential market failure without government action. They said the Australian approach would permit publishers to recover C$620 million a year. Without action, they warned, Canada would lose 700 print journalism jobs out of 3,100 total.  Guilbeault said Canada could adopt the Australian model, which requires Facebook and Google to reach deals to pay news outlets whose links drive activity on their services, or agree on a price through binding arbitration.  Another option is to follow the example of France, which requires large tech platforms to open talks with publishers seeking remuneration for use of news content.  \u201cWe are working to see which model would be the most appropriate,\u201d he said, adding he spoke last week to his French, Australian, German and Finnish counterparts about working together on ensuring fair compensation for web content.  \u201cI suspect that soon we will have five, 10, 15 countries adopting similar rules ... is Facebook going to cut ties with Germany, with France?\u201d he asked, saying that at some point Facebook\u2019s approach would become \u201ctotally unsustainable\u201d.  University of Toronto professor Megan Boler, who specializes in social media, said the Facebook action marked a turning point which would require a common international approach.  \u201cWe could actually see a coalition, a united front against this monopoly, which could be very powerful,\u201d she said in a phone interview.  This week, Facebook said news makes up less than 4% of content people see on the platform but contended that it helped Australian publishers generate about AU $407 million last year.  Google has signed 500 deals worth around $1 billion over three years with publishers around the world for its new News Showcase service and is in talks with Canadian companies.  Guilbeault said Google would still be subject to the new Canadian new law, since Ottawa wanted an approach that was fair, transparent and predictable.  \u201cWhat\u2019s to say that Google - tomorrow, six months, a year from now - doesn\u2019t change its mind and says its doesn\u2019t want to do that any more?\u201d he said.  Lauren Skelly, a spokeswoman for Google in Canada, declined to comment on Guilbeault\u2019s remarks, saying the company did not know details of the legislation.  Michael Geist, Canada Research Chair in Internet and e-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, said Canada should aspire to Google\u2019s approach, where companies put money into content that provided added value.  \u201cIf we follow the Australian model ... we\u2019ll find ourself in much the same spot,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cEverybody loses. The media organizations lose ... Facebook loses.\u201d  Kevin Chan, head of public policy for Facebook in Canada, said there were \u201cother options to support news in Canada that will more fairly benefit publishers of all sizes\u201d.","1378":"NAIROBI\/SAN FRANCISCO, April 23 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc\u2019s struggles with hate speech and other types of problematic content are being hampered by the company\u2019s inability to keep up with a flood of new languages as mobile phones bring social media to every corner of the globe.  The company offers its 2.3 billion users features such as menus and prompts in 111 different languages, deemed to be officially supported. Reuters has found another 31 widely spoken languages on Facebook that do not have official support.  Detailed rules known as \u201ccommunity standards,\u201d which bar users from posting offensive material including hate speech and celebrations of violence, were translated in only 41 languages out of the 111 supported as of early March, Reuters found.  Facebook\u2019s 15,000-strong content moderation workforce speaks about 50 tongues, though the company said it hires professional translators when needed. Automated tools for identifying hate speech work in about 30.  The language deficit complicates Facebook\u2019s battle to rein in harmful content and the damage it can cause, including to the company itself. Countries including Australia, Singapore and the UK are now threatening harsh new regulations, punishable by steep fines or jail time for executives, if it fails to promptly remove objectionable posts.  The community standards are updated monthly and run to about 9,400 words in English.  Monika Bickert, the Facebook vice president in charge of the standards, has previously told Reuters that they were \u201ca heavy lift to translate into all those different languages.\u201d  A Facebook spokeswoman said this week the rules are translated case by case depending on whether a language has a critical mass of usage and whether Facebook is a primary information source for speakers. The spokeswoman said there was no specific number for critical mass.  She said among priorities for translations are Khmer, the official language in Cambodia, and Sinhala, the dominant language in Sri Lanka, where the government blocked Facebook this week to stem rumors about devastating Easter Sunday bombings.  A Reuters report found last year that hate speech on Facebook that helped foster ethnic cleansing in Myanmar went unchecked in part because the company was slow to add moderation tools and staff for the local language.  Facebook says it now offers the rules in Burmese and has more than 100 speakers of the language among its workforce.  The spokeswoman said Facebook\u2019s efforts to protect people from harmful content had \u201ca level of language investment that surpasses most any technology company.\u201d  But human rights officials say Facebook is in jeopardy of a repeat of the Myanmar problems in other strife-torn nations where its language capabilities have not kept up with the impact of social media.  \u201cThese are supposed to be the rules of the road and both customers and regulators should insist social media platforms make the rules known and effectively police them,\u201d said Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch\u2019s Asia Division. \u201cFailure to do so opens the door to serious abuses.\u201d  ABUSE IN FIJIAN  Mohammed Saneem, the supervisor of elections in Fiji, said he felt the impact of the language gap during elections in the South Pacific nation in November last year. Racist comments proliferated on Facebook in Fijian, which the social network does not support. Saneem said he dedicated a staffer to emailing posts and translations to a Facebook employee in Singapore to seek removals.  Facebook said it did not request translations, and it gave Reuters a post-election letter from Saneem praising its \u201ctimely and effective assistance.\u201d  Saneem told Reuters that he valued the help but had expected pro-active measures from Facebook.  \u201cIf they are allowing users to post in their language, there should be guidelines available in the same language,\u201d he said.  Similar issues abound in African nations such as Ethiopia, where deadly ethnic clashes among a population of 107 million have been accompanied by ugly Facebook content. Much of it is in Amharic, a language supported by Facebook. But Amharic users looking up rules get them in English.  At least 652 million people worldwide speak languages supported by Facebook but where rules are not translated, according to data from language encyclopedia Ethnologue. Another 230 million or more speak one of the 31 languages that do not have official support.  Facebook uses automated software as a key defense against prohibited content. Developed using a type of artificial intelligence known as machine learning, these tools identify hate speech in about 30 languages and \u201cterrorist propaganda\u201d in 19, the company said.  Machine learning requires massive volumes of data to train computers, and a scarcity of text in other languages presents a challenge in rapidly growing the tools, Guy Rosen, the Facebook vice president who oversees automated policy enforcement, has told Reuters.  GROWTH REGIONS  Beyond the automation and a few official fact-checkers, Facebook relies on users to report problematic content. That creates a major issue where community standards are not understood or even known to exist.  Ebele Okobi, Facebook\u2019s director of public policy for Africa, told Reuters in March that the continent had the world\u2019s lowest rates of user reporting.  \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t even know that there are community standards,\u201d Okobi said.  Facebook has bought radio advertisements in Nigeria and worked with local organizations to change that, she said. It also has held talks with African education officials to introduce social media etiquette into the curriculum, she said.  Simultaneously, Facebook is partnering with wireless carriers and other groups to expand internet access in countries including Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo where it has yet to officially support widely-used languages such as Luganda and Kituba. Asked this week about the expansions without language support, Facebook declined to comment.  The company announced in February it would soon have its first 100 sub-Saharan Africa-based content moderators at an outsourcing facility in Nairobi. They will join existing teams in reviewing content in Somali, Oromo and other languages.  But the community standards are not translated into Somali or Oromo. Posts in Somali from last year celebrating the al-Shabaab militant group remained on Facebook for months despite a ban on glorifying organizations or acts that Facebook designates as terrorist.  \u201cDisbelievers and apostates, die with your anger,\u201d read one post seen by Reuters this month that praised the killing of a Sufi cleric.  After Reuters inquired about the post, Facebook said it took down the author\u2019s account because it violated policies.  ABILITY TO DERAIL  Posts in Amharic reviewed by Reuters this month attacked the Oromo and Tigray ethnic populations in vicious terms that clearly violated Facebook\u2019s ban on discussing ethnic groups using \u201cviolent or dehumanising speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for exclusion.\u201d  Facebook removed the two posts Reuters inquired about. The company added that it had erred in allowing one of them, from December 2017, to remain online following an earlier user report.  For officials such as Saneem in Fiji, Facebook\u2019s efforts to improve content moderation and language support are painfully slow. Saneem said he warned Facebook months in advance of the election in the archipelago of 900,000 people. Most of them use Facebook, with half writing in English and half in Fijian, he estimated.  \u201cSocial media has the ability to completely derail an election,\u201d Saneem said.  Other social media companies face the same problem to varying degrees.  Facebook-owned Instagram said its 1,179-word community guidelines are in 30 out of 51 languages offered to users. WhatsApp, owned by Facebook as well, has terms in nine of 58 supported languages, Reuters found.  Alphabet Inc\u2019s YouTube presents community guidelines in 40 of 80 available languages, Reuters found. Twitter Inc\u2019s rules are in 37 of 47 supported languages, and Snap Inc\u2019s in 13 out of 21.  \u201cA lot of misinformation gets spread around and the problem with the content publishers is the reluctance to deal with it,\u201d Saneem said. \u201cThey do owe a duty of care. \u201c","1379":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The co-founder of WhatsApp, a messaging service owned by Facebook Inc FB.O with more than 1 billion daily users, said on Monday he was leaving the company, in a loss of one of the strongest advocates for privacy inside Facebook.

Acton left the messaging service company in September to start a foundation, after spending eight years with WhatsApp.  Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg commented on Koum\u2019s post, saying he was grateful for what Koum taught him about encryption \u201cand its ability to take power from centralized systems and put it back in people\u2019s hands. Those values will always be at the heart of WhatsApp.\u201d  Facebook has battled European regulators over a plan to use WhatsApp user data, including phone numbers, to develop products and target ads. The plan is suspended, but WhatsApp said last week it still wanted to move forward eventually.  Stanford alumnus Acton and Ukrainian immigrant Koum co-founded WhatsApp in 2009. Facebook bought WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion in cash and stock.  WhatsApp, a pun on the phrase \u201cWhat\u2019s up?,\u201d grew in popularity in part because its encrypted messages are stored on users\u2019 smartphones and not on company servers, making the service more private.

WhatsApp\u2019s management has fiercely opposed advertising, saying in 2012 that they did not want to be \u201cjust another ad clearinghouse\u201d where the engineering team \u201cspends their day tuning data mining.\u201d  Instead, WhatsApp charged a $1 annual subscription. It dropped that in 2016, moving toward a plan to charge businesses for specialized accounts.","1380":"PALO ALTO\/NEW YORK (Reuters) - By the time social media companies took action against users and groups spurring on the siege of Capitol Hill this week, culminating in the suspension of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s accounts, it was too little too late.

REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton\/File Photo  For weeks, content on Big Tech platforms Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s YouTube as well as upstart fringe social networks foretold the storming of the U.S Capitol on Wednesday that led to five deaths.  In one Facebook post identified by online advocacy group Avaaz, an illustration of Trump holding a machine gun in front of the White House is accompanied by the words \u201cCome and Take it.\u201d Another depicted Trump as Uncle Sam with text paraphrasing the president: \u201cI want you in Washington DC January 6. It\u2019s going to be WILD.\u201d  After the violence, right-wing social users on smaller platforms were retelling the story with videos from the siege to bigger, new audiences, while the major sites showed users sharing false claims about the unrest and groups dedicated to \u201cStop the Steal.\u201d The slogan refers to the pro-Trump followers\u2019 belief that the Nov. 3 election was fraudulent in favor of Democrat Joe Biden, a claim that has been encouraged by Trump without evidence.  Facebook said it \u201cremoved content and accounts that violated our policies against inciting violence and dangerous organizations in the lead-up to January 6\u201d and was continuing to monitor and remove dangerous content.  A Twitter spokeswoman said the company had \u201ctaken enforcement action on thousands of accounts that were attempting to undermine the public conversation and cause real-world harm.\u201d  On Friday, Twitter permanently suspended Trump\u2019s account and also suspended accounts belonging to vitriolic Trump fans including Ron Watkins, who helped run little-regulated image board 8kun, home of many recent posts calling for violence.  YouTube said it removes content that violates its community guidelines.  \u2018LIKE ISIS DOES IT\u2019  Disinformation experts said that while big platforms allowed radical racists, violence enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists to amass a large audience, leading influencers learned what they could get away with.  \u201cYou end up with a very diluted form of the content on the large platform, and the more radical stuff is elsewhere, like ISIS does it,\u201d said Alex Stamos, the former Facebook chief security officer who runs a Stanford program exposing disinformation. He was referring to Islamic state militants.  The mainstream content \u201cis difficult to claim is inappropriate, because it says \u2018come to a rally.\u2019 Bring this and bring that, \u2018get ready to rumble,\u2019 is on 8kun and Parler, and operational stuff is on Telegram,\u201d Stamos said.  Even after major purges of accounts and groups, it has been easy for the operators to re-emerge with slight tweaks, such as swapping \u201ccue\u201d for \u201cQ,\u201d said Daniel Jones, a former FBI analyst and Senate staffer who leads nonprofit research firm Advance Democracy Inc.  On Wednesday, a tweet that turned one of the earliest posts by the anonymous \u201cQ\u201d three years ago into the call to action, \u201cMy fellow Americans, the Storm is upon us,\u201d got 16,000 retweets.  Before Facebook took down its page late on Tuesday, Red-State Secession had urged its nearly 8,000 followers to find the home addresses of officials who \u201chelped steal the election.\u201d  It linked to a website that declared last week a \u201csecond American revolution\u201d would start on Jan. 6 and urged supporters to follow its accounts on more permissive social-media platforms Gab and Parler \u201cbefore we get deleted.\u201d  The group said by email that its Facebook page and blog \u201cpromote the peaceful separation of blue states and red states\u201d and that Facebook had overreacted.  Far-right groups that appeared at the riot maintain a vigorous online presence on digital platforms like Parler, Gab, MeWe, Zello and Telegram, and in some cases discussed using overwhelming crowds to enter the Capitol, said Jared Holt, a disinformation researcher at the Atlantic Council.  MeWe said it prohibits \u201chaters, lawbreakers, violence inciters\u201d and that it has been taking action on violations around the protest.  Gab CEO Andrew Torba said by email: \u201cNone of the platforms you listed, Gab included, are useful for organization of any type.\u201d  Zello, Telegram and Parler did not reply to requests for comment.  RECRUITMENT MACHINE  The selfies snapped on the Senate floor and livestreams broadcast from inside lawmakers\u2019 offices served as marketing to recruit new followers and in some cases earn money.  \u201cWhile extremists on the ground livestreamed and bragged about the chaos they created minute-to-minute, far-right online communities aggregated their content and cheered on their efforts,\u201d said Holt.  The Southern Poverty Law Center documented at least five accounts on blockchain-based video platform DLive that livestreamed Wednesday\u2019s protest, including two accounts belonging to people who participated in the white supremacist-led \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.  One of them, a provocateur named Tim Gionet who is known online as Baked Alaska, livestreamed from inside a Capitol office. He pulled in at minimum $222 in tips from viewers via DLive during the afternoon, according to the report.  He promoted his content to followers on Instagram and Facebook until the company disabled his accounts on Wednesday.  DLive said on Thursday it had suspended three accounts, banned two others and permanently removed over 100 broadcasts. Donations and paid subscriptions will be refunded, it added.  Gionet did not respond to requests for comment.","1381":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc FB.O, Google Inc and Twitter Inc TWTR.N have suspended processing government requests for user data in Hong Kong, they said on Monday, following China's establishment of a sweeping new national security law for the semi-autonomous city.  Facebook, which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, said in a statement it was pausing reviews for all of its services \u201cpending further assessment of the National Security Law.\u201d  Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, and Twitter said they suspended their reviews of data requests from Hong Kong authorities immediately after the law went into effect last week.  Twitter cited \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about the law\u2019s implications.  Google said it would continue reviewing Hong Kong government requests for removals of user-generated content from its services. Twitter declined to comment, while Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.  Social networks often apply localized restrictions to posts that violate local laws but not their own rules for acceptable speech. Facebook restricted 394 such pieces of content in Hong Kong in the second half of 2019, up from eight in the first half of the year, according to its transparency report.  Tech companies have long operated freely in Hong Kong, a financial hub where internet access has been unaffected by the firewall imposed in mainland China, which blocks Google, Twitter and Facebook.  In addition to the announcements by the U.S tech giants, TikTok, the short-form video app owned by China-based ByteDance, said it would pull out of the Hong Kong market within days.  TikTok was designed so it could not be accessed by mainland China, part of a strategy to appeal to a more global audience. Hong Kong is a small, loss-making market for the company, one source familiar with the matter said.

Hong Kong late on Monday published more details about how the new law will strengthen police powers over the internet, including the ability to ask publishers to remove information deemed a threat to national security, refusal of which could result in a fine or jail.  Asked about the moves by the U.S. tech firms and prospects for media freedom, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam told a news conference on Tuesday: \u201cUltimately, time and facts will tell that this law will not undermine human rights and freedoms.\u201d  APPLE AND SIGNAL  Apple said on Monday it does not receive requests for user content directly from the Hong Kong government. Instead, it requires authorities there to submit requests under a mutual U.S.-Hong Kong legal assistance treaty. The U.S. Department of Justice receives the requests and reviews them for \u201clegal conformance,\u201d Apple said.  \u201cWe\u2019re assessing the new law, which went into effect less than a week ago, and we have not received any content requests since the law went into effect,\u201d Apple said in a statement.  Some Hong Kong residents have said they are reviewing their posts on social media related to pro-democracy protests and the security law, and deleting ones they thought would be viewed as sensitive.  \u201cIt\u2019s not safe anymore if the government really does this,\u201d said Richard Lai, 26, a former medical worker.  \u201cI\u2019ll keep using the social media platforms but will just use it for obtaining information but will not post anything.\u201d  Messaging app Signal, which promises end-to-end encryption, has seen a surge in sign-ups by Hong Kong residents in recent days.  \u201cWe\u2019d announce that we\u2019re stopping too, but we never started turning over user data to HK police. Also, we don\u2019t have user data to turn over,\u201d it said on Twitter on Monday.","1382":"(Reuters) - Like an old flame wrecking a first date, Facebook Inc burst in on the matchmaking scene on Tuesday and sent investors in rival apps on a panicked rush for the door.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks about a dating feature at Facebook Inc's annual F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S. May 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  Shares of Match Group Inc and its parent IAC plunged, wiping some $5 billion off their combined market values, after Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said his social media platform would develop its own dating app to rival Tinder, Match and others.  Tinder became known for users swiping right on their cellphones to indicate interest for a potential match and swiping left to reject someone.  Match fell 22 percent \u2013 its largest one-day drop ever \u2013 and IAC, which owns more than a fifth of Match, fell nearly 18 percent in its biggest daily loss in about 13 years.  Spark Networks, owner of JDate and Christian Mingle, also closed 4 percent lower.  Although analysts said Facebook\u2019s initial foray would not likely be a threat to established dating sites - some of which are highly specialized to cater to specific groups - its heft and deep pockets makes it a concern over the long term to the smaller companies.  Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said there was \u201csignificant potential for Facebook to be a big problem for Match,\u201d but one that was dependent on execution over the long term.  Facebook brings to the dating table a treasure trove of data on its active users, which are over 2 billion strong. That could potentially allow it to match people more effectively than rival sites with less data at their fingertips. But privacy concerns surrounding the technology behemoth could discourage some from embracing such a service, some analysts said.  Daniel Kurnos, an analyst at the Benchmark Company, also cited the difficulty of creating a popular dating site, cautioning that it was not an overnight project and one that requires much more than sheer machine learning.  \u201cI think the reaction is a combination of the Facebook news along with concerns that Match was getting toppy,\u201d or expensive, Kurnos told Reuters. \u201cI can\u2019t see Facebook supplanting Match any time soon \u2013 too big a moat.\u201d  Facebook connects friends and acquaintances but until now, has not delved into the domain of match-making, where a host of competitors offer services, from privately held eHarmony to IAC-owned OkCupid and PlentyOfFish.  One problem for Tinder is that their users can log in to their accounts using Facebook.  That has been one way Tinder has assured that their users are real people, noted Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi.  \u201cWhen you\u2019re a Facebook user, and over time you became aware of a comparable service, then it\u2019s less likely that you will go on to Tinder,\u201d Mogharabi noted.  On the other hand, the lower average age of Tinder users could be a competitive advantage for the Match company, he added.  Data from research firm eMarketer shows that approximately 27 percent of smartphone users are single, a number expected to grow to 35 percent in the next five years.","1383":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Wednesday the company would encrypt conversations on more of its messaging services and make them compatible, the latest sign that the world\u2019s biggest social network sees its future in intimate online chats.  Zuckerberg said in a post on his Facebook profile that within a few years direct messaging would dwarf discussion on the traditional, open platform of Facebook\u2019s news feed, where public posts can go viral across the world.  \u201cWorking towards implementing end-to-end encryption for all private communications is the right thing to do,\u201d Zuckerberg said. He cautioned that details of the plan could change as the company consults experts throughout 2019.  The strategy could frustrate law enforcement surveillance efforts as well as lawmakers who have called on Facebook to better moderate user content. It also would limit the company\u2019s ability to generate revenue through targeted ads.  But Zuckerberg said he could live with those tradeoffs because users want better control of their data while still having easy access to their contacts.  As part of Zuckerberg\u2019s strategy, a Facebook user would be able to communicate with WhatsApp users while only having a Messenger account and vice versa. Users would also have more options for how long chats are saved, he added.  \u201cThe future of communication will increasingly shift to private, encrypted services where people can be confident what they say to each other stays secure and their messages and content won\u2019t stick around forever,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the future I hope we will help bring about.\u201d  Facebook shares rose 0.7 percent on Wednesday. Shares in Snap Inc, which owns messaging app Snapchat, ended down more than 2 percent.  Zuckerberg acknowledged that the public may be skeptical about Facebook\u2019s privacy push given the company does not have a \u201cstrong reputation for building privacy protective services.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks at Facebook Inc's annual F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S. May 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  Lawmakers, users and investors have expressed concerns over the last two years that Facebook is not doing enough to safeguard user data after a series of breaches and privacy bugs.  But Zuckerberg wrote that \u201cwe\u2019ve repeatedly shown that we can evolve to build the services that people really want.\u201d  Facebook is one of the biggest global players in private messaging with its WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, each used by more than 1 billion people. Only WhatsApp fully secures message content from all outsiders, including Facebook itself.  Police have raised concerns about introducing similar security to the other services because they would no longer be able to access online chat records to track religious extremists or other perpetrators.  Regulators have called for Facebook to increase moderation of user content, but more encryption would make it difficult to view and track problematic posts.  Encrypted conversations also limit Facebook\u2019s ability to send targeted advertisements. Facebook may need to look for new ways to insert itself between businesses and consumers to generate revenue.  Tencent Holdings Ltd\u2019s WeChat app has shown how a messaging service can generate revenue through not only displaying ads, but also being a marketplace for games, merchandise and services such as taxi rides.  Facebook has encouraged messaging conversations between businesses and consumers since at least 2016 but has not disclosed its revenue from the efforts.  Zuckerberg said on Wednesday that \u201csignificant thought\u201d still needs to go into integrating commerce into messaging.  James Cordwell, a financial analyst at Atlantic Equities, said Facebook\u2019s strategy risks undercutting its current way of making money.  \u201cBut if they can pull off this WeChat-esque strategy,\u201d he said, \u201cit could open up material revenue streams beyond just advertising, something that investors have been craving for quite some time.\u201d","1384":"STRASBOURG (Reuters) - Facebook Inc\u2019s Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg came under pressure from EU lawmakers on Wednesday to come to Europe and shed light on the data breach involving Cambridge Analytica that affected nearly three million Europeans.

The deal comes less than six weeks before a polarising U.S. presidential election.  Three months ago, major advertisers boycotted Facebook in the wake of anti-racism demonstrations that followed the death of George Floyd, an American Black man, in police custody in Minneapolis.  Advertisers have complained for years that big social media companies do too little to prevent ads from appearing alongside hate speech, fake news and other harmful content. Big tech companies have begun taking steps to fend off calls for more regulation.  The platforms agreed to have some practices reviewed by external auditors, and to give advertisers more control of what content is displayed alongside their ads.  \u201cThis is a significant milestone in the journey to rebuild trust online,\u201d said Luis Di Como, executive vice president of global media at Unilever, one of the world\u2019s biggest advertisers. \u201c...Whilst change doesn\u2019t happen overnight, today marks an important step in the right direction.\u201d  Carolyn Everson, Facebook\u2019s vice president for Global Marketing Solutions, said the agreement \u201chas aligned the industry on the brand safety floor and suitability framework, giving us all a unified language to move forward on the fight against hate online.\u201d  SCEPTICAL  Campaigners who want more regulation of social media companies welcomed the agreement but voiced scepticism and vowed to keep up the pressure.  \u201cWhile this is an early step and many details need to be resolved, we welcome today\u2019s announcement,\u201d said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, one of the oldest and biggest anti-racism campaign groups in the United States and a backer of the Stop Hate for Profit campaign behind the boycott.  \u201cThese commitments must be followed in a timely and comprehensive manner, to ensure they are not the kind of empty promises that we have seen too often from Facebook.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  (Reuters) - Facebook Inc CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Wednesday that the company was moving moderation of its most sensitive content, including self-harm and counter terrorism, from contractors to full-time employees during the coronavirus outbreak.  He said on a call with reporters that the goal was to have contractors, who work under third-party vendors, moderate less emotionally taxing content while working at home.  Zuckerberg said it would take time to set guidelines for contractors working from home, such as mental health support for moderators and putting data privacy protections in place. He also said Facebook would increase the number of full-time employees doing this work.  The social media giant has drawn public criticism for encouraging its employees to work from home while its content moderation contractors were forced to come into offices in cities around the world. On Monday, Facebook said it planned to rely more on automated tools to take down offensive content and work with contract vendors to send content reviewers home with pay.  Social media companies face security and privacy issues when content is reviewed in less secure environments, like private homes.  The major shift in Facebook\u2019s review operations occurs as the social media company faces pressure to police content violations. Zuckerberg acknowledged that role changes and reliance on automation would likely reduce the company\u2019s effectiveness at moderating certain types of content.  Facebook content moderators working for third party vendors, including Genpact Ltd and Accenture PLC told Reuters this week that their employers had been scrambling to decide if moderators should come into the office and how they might access review tools remotely.  A contractor in India\u2019s Hyderabad, who moderates counter-terrorism content, told Reuters earlier this week that they had been told it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d from home. They said some Genpact contractors had been working remotely from Wednesday, while others were waiting for company-provided laptops to access the content moderation tool via VPN.  Facebook said this week that more videos and other content might be erroneously removed for policy violations, as it relies more on automated takedown software. But one Accenture contractor speaking to Reuters earlier on Wednesday said there was still a fear \u201cthat three weeks into the coronavirus lockdown, somebody\u2019s going to come up with an AI that can do it all and we\u2019ll get an email saying you don\u2019t have to come back to work because you don\u2019t have a job.\u201d","1387":"FILE PHOTO: Stickers bearing the Facebook logo are pictured at Facebook Inc's F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S., April 30, 2019.

The screens will not give Facebook users the option to hit \u201cdecline.\u201d Instead, they will guide users to either \u201caccept and continue\u201d or \u201cmanage data setting,\u201d according to copies the company showed reporters on Tuesday.  \u201cPeople can choose to not be on Facebook if they want,\u201d Sherman said.  Regulators, investors and privacy advocates are closely watching how Facebook plans to comply with the EU law, not only because Facebook has been embroiled in a privacy scandal but also because other companies may follow its lead in trying to limit the impact of opt-outs.  Last month, Facebook disclosed that the personal information of millions of users, mostly in the United States, had wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, leading to U.S. congressional hearings and worldwide scrutiny of Facebook\u2019s commitment to privacy.  Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Wehner warned in February the company could see a drop-off in usage due to the EU law, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).","1393":"LONDON (Reuters) - Facebook is asking users in Europe which news sources they trust to help it gauge whether to extend a change to its News Feed that it made in the United States earlier this year, designed to filter out misinformation.

Facebook has been criticized for failing to prevent false reports - originating from alleged Russia operatives, for-profit spammers and others - spreading on its platform, notably during the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign.  It has also had a stormy relationship with news organizations, especially those with strong political leanings.

The company, which has more than 2 billion monthly users, turned to its members to determine how news outlets ranked in terms of trustworthiness, using short surveys on the site.  On Thursday, it said it would start showing similar two-part surveys to users in Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Spain, asking them if they are familiar with specific news sources, for example BBC News or the Guardian, and if they trust them.  A Facebook spokesman said the results of the survey would not currently affect the ranking or the composition of News Feed in Britain or any of the other countries yet.  The company said it would announce if it decided to implement any changes.","1394":"* Technology stocks pressured again; Facebook drops 2.2 pct  * Trump expected to impose tariffs on China  * Oil prices drop on profit-booking after recent rally  * Futures down: Dow 243 pts, S&P 25 pts, Nasdaq 89.5 pts (Adds comment, details, updates prices)  By Sruthi Shankar  March 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures were sharply lower on Thursday, with technology stocks dropping on fears of increased regulations in the wake of Facebook Inc\u2019s data privacy issues, while the Trump administration\u2019s move to impose import tariffs on China stoked fears of a global trade war.  Nasdaq futures fell the most and a clutch of big tech names were all in the red in pre-market trading, led by a 2.2 percent slide in Facebook shares. Each of the 86 stocks on the Nasdaq 100 trading ahead of the bell were lower.  The downbeat sentiment also follows the Federal Reserve\u2019s widely expected decision on Wednesday to raise U.S. interest rates by 25 basis points. The U.S. central bank forecast at least two more hikes for 2018, but nearly half of the policy makers projected three more this year and the pace of rate increases is seen quickening in the next two years.  In its first policy meeting under new Fed chief Jerome Powell, the central bank indicated that inflation should finally move higher after years below its 2 percent target and that the economy had recently gained momentum.  Stocks initially rose on the announcement, but ended slightly lower on Wednesday as attention turned to the United States\u2019 plan to impose tariffs on China, which many fear can escalate into a trade war.  President Donald Trump plans to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, possibly targeting the country\u2019s high-technology sector and restricting Chinese investments in the United States. The White House said Trump would sign a presidential memorandum \u201ctargeting China\u2019s economic aggression\u201d at 12:30 p.m. ET on Thursday.  China blamed U.S. export restrictions for its record trade surplus with the United States, but expressed hope that a solution can be found to settle their trade issues.  \u201cU.S. futures are coming under pressure once again as investors continue to display an anxiety about the path of interest rates against a backdrop of escalating trade conflicts,\u201d said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda.  \u201cTrump seems intent on starting trade wars, most notably with China, which could trigger a wave of protectionism and drive up prices in the U.S. and likely weigh on the growth momentum.\u201d  At 8:39 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 243 points and S&P 500 e-minis fell 25 points. Nasdaq 100 e-minis dropped 89.5 points or 1.10 percent.  Concern about a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies also put commodity markets on guard.  Oil prices fell as investors booked profits after this week\u2019s rally, which also bolstered the stock markets, but losses were limited by the ongoing efforts of OPEC and its allies to curb supplies.  Tech stocks remained a weak spot after Facebook\u2019s data breach issue raised fears that any failure by big tech firms to protect personal data could deter advertisers and users and invite tougher regulation.  Other than Facebook, social media stocks Snap and Twitter were down by more than 1 percent. The S&P 500 tech sector index has fallen 2.7 percent so far this week compared with a drop of less than 1.5 percent for the wider S&P 500. Facebook is down nearly 9 percent since Friday.

For users in the United States, Instagram will temporarily remove the \u201cRecent\u201d tab from hashtag pages starting Thursday, it said in a statement on Twitter.  \u201cWe\u2019re doing this to reduce the real-time spread of potentially harmful content that could pop up around the election,\u201d the statement added.  Instagram\u2019s \u201cRecent\u201d tab arranges hashtags in chronological order and amplifies content. Researchers have cautioned that automated amplification can lead to the rapid spread of misinformation on the platform.  The development comes as social media companies face increasing pressure to combat election-related misinformation and prepare for the possibility of violence or poll place intimidation around the Nov. 3 vote.  Earlier this month, Twitter Inc TWTR.N said it will remove tweets calling for people to interfere with the U.S. election process or implementation of election results, including through violence.  Twitter has recently announced several temporary steps to slow amplification of content: for example, from Oct. 20 to at least the end of the U.S. election week, global users pressing \u201cretweet\u201d will be directed first to the \u201cquote tweet\u201d button to encourage people to add their own commentary.  Twitter said it will also stop surfacing trending topics without added context. Its decision to hit the brakes on automated recommendations contrasts with the approach at Facebook, which has previously boosted promotion of its groups product.  Separately on Thursday, Facebook acknowledged that a technical error in its systems caused a number of ads from the Republican and Democratic parties to be improperly paused.  It was the result of a policy change Facebook announced last month to block new political ads in the week prior to the elections. Facebook said it has made updates to enable the affected ads to run.","1401":"Social media users have been sharing a video in which an individual makes numerous false statements about the novel coronavirus pandemic.  Reuters Fact Check. REUTERS  The clip was uploaded to Facebook (here) and features an individual expressing numerous claims and opinions. This article will only address the primary claims.  \u201cScientists could not have predicted the pandemic if it wasn\u2019t planned\u201d  The man in the video delivers a monologue in which he states scientists made predictions \u201cas far back as 2017 that there was going to be this pandemic\u201d, adding \u201cthere\u2019s no way that someone could have predicted that unless they had some inside knowledge of a release of some type of pathogenic pandemic (incoherent) pathogen.\u201d (1:50)  This is false: scientists warned of a pandemic because modern life made a global outbreak likely. For instance, the Obama administration had experienced the 2009 swine flu pandemic (here), the 2015-16 Zika virus epidemic (here) and the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak in West Africa (here).  In 2017, news outlet CNN listed seven factors that increased the likelihood of a global pandemic, including urbanisation, climate change and global travel (here). US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci and billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates also warned of a deadly outbreak (here and here).  Reuters reported last year that new research showed: \u201cpandemics will emerge more often, spread faster, cost more and kill more people than COVID-19 without bold action to halt the habitat destruction that helps viruses hop from wildlife to humans\u201d (here).  \u201cThe second wave will be caused by masks, 5G and vaccines\u201d  The speaker continues to make false statements, saying: \u201cThey\u2019re going to have three different causes of people getting sick that is going to be attributed to the second wave of COVID-19.\u201d (3:52)  The first causal factor, the speaker claims, is masks: \u201cAs people are allowed to come back into society, their immune systems are already going to have been supressed because of the wearing of the mask, which is going to increase cortisol levels\u2026they\u2019re having to suck oxygen through a mask\u2026rendering an individual more susceptible to any kind of pathogen.\u201d (2:40)  There is no evidence to support this. Misinformation about masks spread widely during the pandemic\u2019s first wave and Reuters found no expert evidence to support the claim that wearing face masks weakens the immune system (here).  Virologist Angela Rasmussen, a research scientist at Columbia University, told fact-checkers PolitiFact in June 2020: \u201cThere\u2019s no decreased oxygen or increased carbon dioxide from normal breathing while wearing a mask, and no evidence that masks have any effect on the immune system or immune function.\" (here)  Fact-checkers at USA Today debunked a similar claim from May 2020 (here) and Reuters has since identified numerous false claims about face masks here , here and here .  The UK government states: \u201cwearing a face covering may reduce the spread of coronavirus droplets in certain circumstances, helping to protect others.\u201d (here)  The speaker in the video then claims: \u201cThere is new technology that\u2019s been rolled out called 5G. The implication of that technology are not fully understood, but there\u2019s been over 2,000 studies done showing how that technology supresses the immune system.\u201d (3:26)  The World Health Organization says no research has linked exposure to wireless technology with negative health effects (here). Reuters has previously written about misleading attempts to link COVID-19 and 5G networks here and here .  To complete his theory, the man states: \u201cThe third component is people are going to come running out wanting the vaccine\u2026but they\u2019re going to get sick when they get their vaccines.\u201d (3:45)  This is false. The Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer BioNTech vaccines, which are available in the UK, went through clinical trials (here) to prove their safety and efficacy. During the trials, half of the volunteers were given the vaccine and half were given a placebo dummy treatment (here). Pfizer\u2019s clinical trials of more than 40,000 people reported that the vaccine can prevent 95% of COVID-19 cases and AstraZeneca\u2019s trials of more than 23,000 people showed the vaccine to be 70.4% effective (here).  Reuters has debunked false claims about COVID-19 vaccine safety here and here .  VERDICT  False. The fact scientists warned of a pandemic does not mean the COVID-19 outbreak was planned, and the second wave was not caused by masks, 5G or vaccines. Scientists had concerns about the novel coronavirus spreading in winter as people spend more time together in enclosed spaces (here), and this was exacerbated by problems with contact tracing (here) and the development of new strains (here).

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Three months ago, Facebook FB.O announced plans to launch the digital currency in June 2020, in partnership with other members of the Libra Association set up by the U.S. tech giant to manage the project.  However the attempt to drag cryptocurrencies into the mainstream has since met with regulatory and political skepticism globally, with France and Germany pledging to block Libra from operating in Europe.  Bertrand Perez, managing director of the Geneva-based Libra Association, said discussions were continuing with regulators from Europe and elsewhere to assuage concerns.  \u201cWhen we (made) the announcement in June, that was our North Star,\u201d Perez said of the June 2020 launch date, adding that a delay of one or two quarters would not be an issue.  \u201cWhat is important is that we need to comply with the regulators and we need to make sure that they are on board with us and fully comfortable with our solutions.\u201d  \u201cWe knew that we would have to answer lots of questions coming from regulators on both sides of the Atlantic, and from other parts of the world,\u201d he added in an interview at the United Nations offices in Geneva.  Libra, announced as Facebook expands into e-commerce, will be backed by a reserve of real-world assets, including bank deposits and short-term government securities, and overseen by the 28-member association.  The structure is intended to foster trust and stabilize the price volatility that plagues cryptocurrencies and renders them impractical for commerce and payments.  Last week David Marcus, the executive leading the project at Facebook, said the company still aimed to launch the digital currency in 2020.  \u201cThe goal is still to launch Libra next year,\u201d he told Swiss newspaper NZZ. \u201cUntil then, we\u2019ll need to address all questions adequately, create a suitable regulatory environment.\u201d  The association has thus far taken a backseat to Facebook in visibility on the project, but Perez stressed it was independent of the social media giant, which will have an equal vote as other members in the association\u2019s decision-making.  Other members of the association include Vodafone VOD.L, PayPal PYPL.O, Mastercard MA.N and Visa V.N, and the group plans to bring more members on board in the near future, which it expects to include banks.  \u201cIt\u2019s known this project was incubated at Facebook and started at Facebook, but at an early stage, there was a decision that this should be a public good not controlled by a single entity,\u201d added Perez, a senior director of payments engineering for PayPal before starting at Libra this May.  \u201cThe Libra Association is clearly an association and not a subsidiary of Facebook.\u201d","1409":"Feb 27 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc:  * FACEBOOK INC SAYS GIVEN GROWING CONCERNS AROUND COVID-19, CO MADE DECISION TO CANCEL IN-PERSON COMPONENT OF F8 2020 Source text: bit.ly\/2PsVHxC Further company coverage:","1410":"FILE PHOTO: The Instagram application is seen on a phone screen August 3, 2017.

The White House has said \u201cFrance\u2019s unilateral measure appears to target innovative U.S. technology firms that provide services in distinct sectors of the economy.\u201d  Other EU countries, including Austria, Britain, Spain and Italy, have also announced plans for their own digital taxes.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  LONDON (Reuters) - Facebook\u2019s move to block all media content in Australia is a staggeringly irresponsible attempt to bully a democracy and will stiffen the resolve of legislators across the world to get tough with the tech giants, a senior British lawmaker said.  \u201cThis action - this bully boy action - that they\u2019ve undertaken in Australia will I think ignite a desire to go further amongst legislators around the world,\u201d Julian Knight, chair of the British Parliament\u2019s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, told Reuters.  \u201cWe represent people and I\u2019m sorry but you can\u2019t run bulldozer over that - and if Facebook thinks it\u2019ll do that it will face the same long-term ire as the likes of big oil and tobacco,\u201d Knight said.  The social media giant shocked Australia on Thursday when it blocked all media content from its platform in a stunning escalation of a dispute with the government over paying for content.  The move came after the government of Scott Morrison drafted a law to require Facebook and Google to reach commercial deals with news outlets whose links drive traffic to their platforms, or be subjected to forced arbitration to agree a price.  \u201cIf you gain value from carrying trusted sources of information - in the same way as if you gain value for example from music streams - then those that carry those and then sell advertising off the back of that value, should pay for it,\u201d Knight said.  \u201cI think they\u2019re almost using Australia as a test of strength for global democracies as to whether or not they wish to impose restrictions on the way in which they do business, or corrections to the way in which they operate within markets. So, we\u2019re all behind Australia in my view.\u201d  Asked if Facebook and other tech giants had got too big for their boots, Knight said: \u201cThat\u2019s the understatement of the century isn\u2019t it?\u201d  \u201cThe way in which you tackle the tech giants in a positive way is to look at competition,\u201d he said.","1413":"FILE PHOTO: Silhouettes of mobile users are seen next to a screen projection of Facebook logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018.

Reuters Fact Check. REUTERS  The 662-word post lists over 30 questions that express scepticism, including: \u201cWhy are there many videos of empty hospitals?\u201d and \u201cWhy does 2020 have the 14th highest overall world death toll in last 30 yrs?\u201d (here, here, here, here).  The post will examine seven questions in the post, which can be considered the primary claims. The remaining questions, various of which include expression of opinion, are outside the scope of this check.  Question one asks: \u201cWhy did a Cambridge PCR test study of 10k people show 100% of their positives to be false?\u201d This question refers to testing of students carried out by the University of Cambridge. On Dec. 6, 2020 the student testing report showed 9,376 students from 1,937 different \u2018pools\u2019 gave readable swabs. Ten of the 1,937 pools generated positive results in initial testing but the individuals in the pools were retested and gave negative results. Fact-checkers Full Fact reported about this in depth here .  Question two asks: \u201cWhy are there many videos of empty hospitals?\u201d This question follows a spate of videos showing quiet corridors in some hospital buildings. The BBC News Reality Check team recently examined these videos (www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/55560714) and reported: \u201cbecause of the way healthcare trusts have reorganised hospitals, often separating Covid patients from others, and cancelling non-urgent care to free up capacity, some parts of hospital buildings will currently look empty. That doesn't mean hospitals aren't busy.\u201d Reuters has also published fact checks into individual videos showing quiet hospital buildings (here, here). The latest government figures show there are over 37,000 COVID-19 patients in UK hospitals (here).  Question three asks \u201cWhy are the Nightingale facilities being dismantled & closing?\u201d The limited use of the emergency Nightingale hospitals set up during the pandemic\u2019s first wave has been the subject of scrutiny. The government said in December they remained on standby (here) and London\u2019s Nightingale hospital last week reopened to treat non-COVID-19 patients and reduce pressure on the city\u2019s hospitals (here).  Question four reads: \u201cWhy is there video after video of people pretending to administer vaccines?\u201d The post doesn\u2019t direct to any specific examples, however Reuters has debunked various rumours that photos and videos taken of COVID-19 vaccine recipients are staged (here, here, here, here)  Question five states: \u201cWhy does 2020 have the 14th highest overall world death toll in last 30 yrs?\u201d The Facebook post does not say where the figures came from. However, exactly the same claim \u2013 that 2020 had the 14th highest death toll in the last 30 years \u2013 was earlier made on Twitter with reference to UK mortality rates (here).  The graph calculated the average number of deaths per population between 1991 \u2013 and 2018 by dividing total annual UK deaths (bit.ly\/2J3VO31) by annual UK population estimates (here) and multiplying that figure by a thousand. There was not a full data set for 2020 when the graph was published, however, so it relied on estimated death rates for the final two months of the year for Northern Ireland and Scotland and the final five weeks for England and Wales. The graph does not reference how the estimates were calculated.  Since this table was published, Office for National Statistics (ONS) has published a blog comparing deaths in 2020 to previous years (here). \u201cThere are several ways to measure mortality and to fully understand we must look at this in a number of ways,\u201d the author Sarah Caul says, explaining why five-year average and age-standardised mortality rates are useful indicators.  Returning to the claim about world mortality rates, there is no complete data yet to assess whether 2020 had the 14th highest overall world death toll. The latest figures do, however, show that most countries saw an increase in excess deaths in 2020. Produced by researchers from Oxford University, \u2018Our World In Data\u2019 updates its figures on excess mortality \u2013 that\u2019s the number of deaths over and above the 5-year historical average \u2013 during the pandemic each week. The latest update on Jan. 9, 2021 found that every country except Israel and Taiwan saw increased excess deaths between Jan. 5, 2020 and Dec. 27, 2020 (bit.ly\/3srxRnN and here). They note, however, that this data cannot be calculated for every country, as few have statistical agencies able to report daily or weekly death tolls (here). The figures also do not include the most recent weeks of countries\u2019 data series due to delays in reporting (here).  Another question asks: \u201cAsymptomatic transfer is now debunked, so why are we still using this data to enforce restrictions?\u201d This statement is not correct and may relate to a viral claim from December 2020 that a study found no asymptomatic spread of coronavirus. Fact-checkers Politifact wrote: \u201cThe journal article in question found people with symptoms were more contagious than those without, but asymptomatic people did transmit the virus.\u201d(here)  It\u2019s not clear why some patients who test positive for the virus do not display any symptoms, but health officials believe they pose less transmission risk. However, the people they infect may display symptoms (here).  Finally, the post states: \u201cWhy, when they have already been caught in August exaggerating death figures, do you not think they'd do it again?\u201d The claim refers to the government\u2019s decision in August to stop reporting all deaths after a positive test as a coronavirus death and introducing a cut-off of 28 days and 60 days following a positive test to record coronavirus deaths. This reduced the total number of coronavirus deaths in England but did not mean the government was \u2018caught\u2019 exaggerating deaths. The change in methodology, addressed previously by Reuters Fact Check (here), was made after the government reviewed its own data and learnt more about the virus.

The company will monitor who can go \"Live\" on Facebook depending on factors such as prior community standard violations, Sandberg said in a blog post here.  A lone gunman killed 50 people at two mosques in New Zealand on March 15, while livestreaming the massacre.  Facebook has identified more than 900 different videos showing portions of the 17-minutes of carnage and has used its existing artificial intelligence tools to identify and remove hate groups in Australia and New Zealand, the blog said.  Last week, the social networking giant said it removed 1.5 million videos globally that had footage of the New Zealand mosque attack in the first 24 hours after the attack.  Earlier this week, one of the main groups representing Muslims in France said it was suing Facebook and YouTube, accusing them of inciting violence by allowing the streaming of the video.  Facebook, the world\u2019s largest social network with 2.7 billion users, has faced growing discontent over its approach to privacy and user data amid increasing concerns over its advertising practices.  (The story corrects headline and first paragraph to say restrictions on who can go live, not restrict live videos.)","1418":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc said on Wednesday it would introduce U.S. news programs this year hosted by Anderson Cooper of CNN, Shepard Smith of Fox News and Jorge Ramos of Univision to try to improve the quality of news on the social network.  Facebook is paying the three companies and other news organizations to produce shows for its video service, known as Watch, in the hopes of countering false news stories and boosting the social network\u2019s fledgling video ad business.  The shows would be original to Facebook and would launch in the coming months with ad breaks, said Campbell Brown, Facebook\u2019s head of global news partnerships.  \u201cWe tried to assemble a diverse set of partners who are already doing quality news who are also really adept at engaging the audience,\u201d Brown, a former television anchor, said in an interview.  Time Warner Inc\u2019s CNN, Fox News and Univision generally appeal to different audiences.  Other programs on Facebook Watch would be produced by ABC News, owned by Walt Disney Co, Advance Publications\u2019 Alabama Media Group and websites ATTN: and Mic, with more to be announced later, Brown said. Some shows would appear daily and others less frequently.  The shows will experiment with social media features such as polls, she said.  Social sites have struggled to reduce fake news stories, sensationalism and hoaxes that spread easily on social media. The posts have been blamed for political divisions worldwide and violence in countries such as Sri Lanka.  \u201cThere\u2019s been a real effort to down-rank clickbait sensationalism,\u201d Brown said.  On the business side, Facebook has turned to video as a source of advertising revenue as inventory in its News Feed becomes scarce.  Facebook competes for content and ad revenue with companies such as Alphabet Inc\u2019s YouTube, Snap Inc and Twitter Inc.  Facebook will share ad revenue with the companies in addition to paying them to produce the programs, Brown said. She declined to disclose terms.  Facebook has had a rocky relationship with news organizations as it piles up advertising profits while paying little for content, but news executives expressed satisfaction with the latest arrangement.  \u201cFacebook\u2019s very committed to making Watch happen, and they want to bring content that they think will do well both for the publishers and for advertisers,\u201d Jason Ehrich, Fox News senior vice president, said in an interview.","1419":"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg was as shocked as anyone when he learned that Facebook Inc had blocked news content from its website in his country at 5:30 a.m. on Thursday.  FILE PHOTO: The Facebook logo is displayed on a mobile phone in this picture illustration taken December 2, 2019. REUTERS\/Johanna Geron\/Illustration\/File Photo  He had been in direct contact with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and, he thought, was making progress toward an accommodation over proposed rules that would force the tech titan to pay publishers to link to their news.  Yet this was a shock four years in the making - a potential global turning point for regulation of big social media companies that began with Australia\u2019s complex, provincial politics in 2017.  The fight between the world\u2019s largest social media company and the 13th-largest economy is the result of a bill, scheduled for debate next week in Australia\u2019s Senate, that was foisted on Frydenberg and his boss at the time.  Then-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull wanted to relax media merger-and-acquisition laws to let Australian news outlets like Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp scale up and survive a revenue crash as advertisers took their business to internet heavyweights like Facebook and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google.  Turnbull\u2019s conservative government needed support from outspoken independent Nick Xenophon, who held the balance of power in the Senate. He made the government promise an inquiry into \u201cinternet giants such as Google and Facebook\u201d.  This week\u2019s blowup \u201cis something I\u2019d be very happy to take responsibility for,\u201d said Xenophon, now a private sector lawyer.  \u201cIf there is a viable rival to Facebook in years to come, its genesis will be the event that occurred in Australia on the 18th of February,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cFacebook has exposed the level of its market power. It\u2019s behaving like a monopoly.\u201d  Turnbull\u2019s treasurer, Scott Morrison, honoured the Xenophon deal by tasking the antitrust regulator with examining Google and Facebook to \u201cfully understand their influence in Australia\u201d.  The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission\u2019s (ACCC) inquiry ground on, Morrison became prime minister and Frydenberg became his treasurer. Meanwhile, Facebook\u2019s image in Australia as a harmless online gathering spot was marred by revelations it sold third-party marketers the personal data of millions of people to target in the 2016 U.S. election.  CONCILIATION VS BOMBSHELL  When the ACCC delivered its report in mid-2019, Frydenberg called out Facebook\u2019s $5 billion fine for the election-related privacy breaches, saying it and Google \u201cneed to be held to account and their activities need to be more transparent\u201d.  He left it to Australian media and Big Tech to thrash out a framework to negotiate the price of links that draw clicks - and advertising dollars - to their platforms. When that failed the ACCC stepped in, saying it would appoint an arbitrator to set fees in the event of stalemate, a model suggested by News Corp.  The tech titans responded last September with threats to cancel their services in the country if the bargaining code took effect. They repeated the threats in January.  With parliamentary votes looming, Prime Minister Morrison revealed that Microsoft Corp CEO Satya Nadella had offered its search engine Bing if Google\u2019s disappeared. Frydenberg said he was talking with Zuckerberg.  As the bill moved through and passed the lower house, Google struck deals with free-to-air network Seven West Media Ltd and rival Nine Entertainment Co Holdings, which also owns the Sydney Morning Herald and Melbourne\u2019s The Age newspapers.  \u201cNone of these deals would be happening if we didn\u2019t have the legislation before the parliament,\u201d Frydenberg said on Wednesday. Then, in the early hours of Thursday morning Canberra time, News Corp announced a global deal with Google.  News Corp and Seven thanked Morrison, Frydenberg and ACCC commissioner Rod Sims for forcing the issue. Murdoch\u2019s company said Xenophon was \u201cinstrumental in having Australia adopt a world first, highly innovative policy approach\u201d.  As Google turned conciliatory and the bill looked set to become law next week, it was Facebook\u2019s turn.  Frydenberg was dressed for tennis on Thursday morning when he learned Facebook had taken a dramatically different approach - pulling the plug on Australia\u2019s news sites and, inadvertently, on many government disaster-information pages and other public-service outlets.  Facebook said on Thursday that because the bill \u201cdoes not provide clear guidance on the definition of news content, we have taken a broad definition in order to respect the law as drafted.\u201d  Frydenberg cancelled his tennis game and arranged another call with Zuckerberg, and another the next day.  \u201cWe certainly weren\u2019t given any notice by Facebook,\u201d the treasurer told reporters. But he said his half-hour call was \u201cconstructive\u201d.  \u201cWe\u2019ll hear from them in the coming days and we\u2019ll see if we can find a pathway forward.\u201d","1420":"FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen placed on a keyboard in this illustration taken March 25, 2020.

WhatsApp will ask European users to confirm they are at least 16 years old when they are prompted to agree new terms of service and a privacy policy provided by a new WhatsApp Ireland Ltd entity in the next few weeks.  It is not clear how or if the age limit will be checked given the limited data requested and held by the service.  Facebook, which has a separate data policy, is taking a different approach to teens aged between 13 and 15 in order to comply with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law.  It is asking them to nominate a parent or guardian to give permission for them to share information on the platform, otherwise they will not see a fully personalized version of the social media platform.  But WhatsApp, which had more than 1.5 billion users in January according to Facebook, said in a blog post it was not asking for any new rights to collect personal information in the agreement it has created for the European Union.  \u201cOur goal is simply to explain how we use and protect the limited information we have about you,\u201d it said.

Facebook itself is under scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world since disclosing last month that the personal information of millions of users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, setting off wider concerns about how it handles user data.  WhatsApp\u2019s minimum age of use will remain 13 years in the rest of the world, in line with its parent.  GDPR is the biggest overhaul of online privacy since the birth of the internet, giving Europeans the right to know what data is stored on them and the right to have it deleted.  Apple Inc AAPL.O and some other tech firms have said they plan to give people in the United States and elsewhere the same protections and rights that Europeans will gain.  European regulators have already disrupted a move by WhatsApp to change its policies to allow it to share users\u2019 phone numbers and other information with Facebook to help improve the product and more effectively target ads.  WhatsApp suspended the change in Europe after widespread regulatory scrutiny. It said on Tuesday it still wanted to share the data at some point.  \u201cAs we have said in the past, we want to work closer with other Facebook companies in the future and we will keep you updated as we develop our plans,\u201d it said.  Other changes announced by WhatsApp on Tuesday include allowing users to download a report detailing the data it holds on them, such as the make and model of the device they used, their contacts and groups and any blocked numbers.  \u201cThis feature will be rolling out to all users around the world on the newest version of the app,\u201d it said.  The blog post also points to safety tips on the service, such as the ability to block unwanted users, and delete and report spam.","1426":"LONDON (Reuters) - Facebook is lifting the lid on the algorithm that decides which posts appear in its news feed, as part of a drive to be more transparent and offer greater control to users.

After a series of privacy scandals, Facebook needs to regain users\u2019 trust as it prepares to roll out a single messaging service combining Facebook messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram that could make it even more central to users\u2019 communications.  The new news feed feature will show users the data that connect them to a particular type of post, Hegeman said, for example that they are friends with the poster and they\u2019ve liked their posts more than others, they\u2019ve frequently commented on that type of post before, or that the post is popular with users with the same interests.  It will detail some of the interactions that lead the algorithm to reach its conclusion, he said, although it will not show all of the thousands of inputs that influence the decision.  \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to really focus on the signals that are most important and play the biggest role in what causes people to see a post or not,\u201d Hegeman said.  \u201cWe don\u2019t think this is going to solve everything on the theme of transparency but we think this is an important step.\u201d  Facebook developed the new tool with research groups in New York, Denver, Paris and Berlin, he said, and as a result of feedback Facebook has made it easy for users to access tools to control what is in the news feed themselves.  Facebook is also updating its \u201cWhy Am I Seeing this Ad?\u201d feature launched a few years ago with additional details, Hegeman said, such as explaining how ads work that target customers using email lists.

Analysts blamed the 12 percent slump on lingering questions about how loss-making Lyft will become profitable and the big pop in its highly anticipated first day of trading.  Lyft has been closely watched as a bellwether for larger rival Uber Technologies Inc, which sources say is planning to kick off its IPO in April.  Lyft touched a session low of $67.78 on Monday before closing down 11.8 percent at $69.01, well below the company\u2019s IPO price of $72.  The shares had opened at $87.24 in their Nasdaq debut on Friday, up 21 percent from their IPO price, then pared gains to close up nearly 9 percent, valuing Lyft at $22.2 billion. The offering was 20 times oversubscribed, similar to other high-profile IPOs.  The swoon was reminiscent of Facebook\u2019s debut in May 2012. After pricing at $38 a share, Facebook shares rose as much as 18 percent before fading and leaving underwriters to frantically defend the IPO price into the close of that first day, which like Lyft\u2019s was a Friday.  Come Monday, that support was no where to be found and Facebook opened at $36.53. The social media company would not regain its IPO price for 14 months.  \u201cI think the initial strength was exacerbated by not losing out of getting a piece of Lyft and the herd mentality of IPOs,\u201d said Catherine McCarthy, an Allianz Global Investors research analyst.  \u201cIt traded really aggressively out of the gate,\u201d McCarthy said, noting that Allianz had traded out of Lyft because its shares were valued at above $72.  Whether Lyft can deliver the turnaround Facebook managed is a top question for investors. After hitting a lifetime low about three months after its IPO, Facebook shares have gained more than 800 percent to become the \u201cF\u201d in the vaunted FANG group of tech high flyers.  Lyft reported a loss of $911 million in 2018, up from $688 million in 2017, despite revenue doubling in 2018 to $2.16 billion. The company has not laid out a timeline for when it will turn a profit.  Brokerage Guggenheim Securities started coverage on Lyft with a \u2018neutral\u2019 rating, saying there was a lack of visibility on the path to profitability.  Lyft, the first ride-hailing company to go public, had a market share of 39 percent in the United States as of 2018.","1429":"(Corrects headline and first paragraph to show woman was charged by U.S. government, not U.S. special counsel)  Nov 20 (Reuters) - A Russia-based news company whose accountant was charged by federal prosecutors for attempting to meddle in U.S. elections sued Facebook Inc in a federal court on Tuesday, claiming that its Facebook page was improperly removed.

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a conference call with reporters that Facebook had not seen \u201cany meaningful impact\u201d on usage or ad sales since the scandal, although he added, \u201cit\u2019s not good\u201d if people are unhappy with the company.  Shares rose more than 3 percent after the bell.  Zuckerberg told reporters that he accepted blame for the data leak, which has angered users, advertisers and lawmakers, while also saying he was still the right person to head the company he founded.  \u201cWhen you\u2019re building something like Facebook that is unprecedented in the world, there are going to be things that you mess up,\u201d Zuckerberg said, adding that the important thing was to learn from mistakes.  He said he was not aware of any discussions on the Facebook board about him stepping down, although directors would face a challenge if they wanted to oust him because Zuckerberg is the controlling shareholder.  He said he had not fired anyone over the scandal and did not plan to. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to throw anyone else under the bus for mistakes that we made here,\u201d he said.  Facebook first acknowledged last month that personal information about millions of users wrongly ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica.  Zuckerberg will testify about the matter next Tuesday and Wednesday during two U.S. congressional hearings.  London-based Cambridge Analytica, which has counted U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign among its clients, disputed Facebook\u2019s estimate of affected users. On Wednesday it said on Twitter it had received no more than 30 million records from a researcher it hired to collect data about people on Facebook.  Zuckerberg, on the call with reporters, said Facebook should have done more to audit and oversee third-party app developers like the one that Cambridge Analytica hired in 2014.  \u201cKnowing what I know today, clearly we should have done more,\u201d he said.  Facebook was taking steps to restrict which personal data is available to third-party app developers, he said, and it might take two more years to fix Facebook's problems.

Most of the up to 87 million people whose data was shared with Cambridge Analytica were in the United States, Facebook Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer wrote in a blog post. (Graphic: bit.ly\/2q5r5pl)  Shares in Facebook closed down 0.6 percent on Wednesday to $155.10. They have tumbled more than 16 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke.  The previous estimate of more than 50 million Facebook users affected by the data leak came from two newspapers, the New York Times and London\u2019s Observer, based on their investigations of Cambridge Analytica.  Zuckerberg said Facebook came to the higher estimate by looking at the number of people who had downloaded a personality quiz app created by Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan, or about 270,000 people, and then adding in the number of friends they had.  Cambridge Analytica has said that it engaged Kogan \u201cin good faith\u201d to collect Facebook data in a manner similar to how other third-party app developers have harvested personal information.  The scandal has kicked off investigations by Britain\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, Australia\u2019s Privacy Commissioner and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and by some 37 U.S. state attorneys general.  Nigeria\u2019s government will investigate allegations of improper involvement by Cambridge Analytica in that country\u2019s 2007 and 2015 elections, a presidency spokesman said on Monday.","1431":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc FB.O said on Wednesday that growth would continue to slow as its business matured and it reported a surge in quarterly expenses, disappointing Wall Street expectations that the costs of improving privacy would level off.  The news raised concerns that Facebook\u2019s days of astronomical growth were firmly in the rearview mirror, and shares of the world\u2019s biggest social network dropped 7.2% in extended trading.  Facebook reported its slowest-ever revenue growth for the fourth quarter, at 25%, and Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, David Wehner, said on a call with investors that the pace of expansion will slow further in the first quarter of 2020. Wehner forecast a percentage point decline in the growth rate in the low- to mid-single digits, citing Facebook\u2019s maturing business, the impact of global privacy regulation and concerns about ad targeting.  \u201cWe have experienced some modest impact from these headwinds to date. The majority of the impact lies in front of us,\u201d Wehner said.  He specifically noted changes made by Apple Inc AAPL.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, which have both announced new restrictions on browser cookies used to track users online.  Facebook, the world\u2019s second-biggest seller of online ads, has been under fierce scrutiny worldwide in recent years over its privacy practices. It is also facing heat over how its services have been manipulated to spread misinformation.  The company addressed those issues starting in mid-2018 following repeated scandals, causing growth in expenses to surge by more than 100% for several quarters as it hired privacy staff and invested in content moderation.  That investment began declining last year, leading analysts to believe Facebook was largely finished building out its new systems and beginning to find efficiencies that could whittle costs further.  But the company reported total costs and expenses increased 34% to $12.22 billion in the fourth quarter, more than double the 14% that analysts had forecast and dragging down operating margins to 42% from 46% a year earlier.

REUTERS\/Regis Duvignau\/File Photo  It also announced it had reached a $550 million settlement in principle of an Illinois lawsuit that claimed it illegally collected and stored biometric data for millions of users without their consent.  The fourth-quarter revenue growth of 25% did beat analysts' expectations of a dip to 23%. But it is the company's fourth straight quarter of revenue growth less than 30%, playing to concerns that Facebook is struggling to restore its pre-2018 momentum when sales regularly grew upwards of 40%.  Still, Facebook\u2019s shares rose more than 50% over the last year, raising pressure for a strong performance.  \u201cFB stock had made a big run-up in anticipation of the report ...so the room for error was low,\u201d said Daniel Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Co.  The company continued to add users, beating estimates. Monthly users of Facebook\u2019s core social network climbed 8% to 2.5 billion, while 2.9 billion people used one of its apps - Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram or Messenger - each month.  That unique reach keeps advertisers dependent on Facebook\u2019s apps and online ad network. Facebook has also been trying to build out e-commerce offerings in the last year like Instagram Checkout, which make shopping more convenient by allowing users to complete transactions from within Facebook\u2019s apps.  Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said in the investor call that the company is moving \u201cvery slowly and very, very carefully\u201d with those products.  Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, who has come under fire over Facebook\u2019s decision to permit political ads that include false information and lies, said he would also focus the company on communicating Facebook\u2019s values more clearly.  The company had generated \u201cpositive but shallow sentiment\u201d by trying to be liked and avoid causing offense over the past decade, he said. \u201cMy goal for this next decade isn\u2019t to be liked, but to be understood.\u201d  (GRAPHIC - Facebook's slowing revenue growth - )","1432":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's telecoms watchdog on Monday said over-the-top (OTT) communication services do not currently need a regulatory framework, casting aside the threat of potential restrictions on platforms such as Facebook FB.O, WhatsApp and Google GOOGL.O.  India\u2019s telecoms firms have long lobbied for regulation of apps that offer free voice and text services over the internet, arguing that such services erode their revenues.  \u201cIt is not an opportune moment to recommend a comprehensive regulatory framework for various aspects of services referred to as OTT services, beyond the extant laws and regulations prescribed presently,\u201d the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) said in a statement.

Zuckerberg, speaking in a livestream of the company\u2019s weekly internal Q&A session, said he had been aware of child exploitation risks before announcing his encryption plan and acknowledged that it would reduce tools to fight the problem.  \u201cWhen we were deciding whether to go to end-to-end encryption across the different apps, this was one of the things that just weighed the most heavily on me,\u201d he said.  Addressing an employee question about online child abuse, Zuckerberg acknowledged that losing access to the content of messages would mean \u201cyou\u2019re fighting that battle with at least a hand tied behind your back.\u201d  But he said he was \u201coptimistic\u201d that Facebook would be able to identify predators even in encrypted systems using the same tools it used to fight election interference, like patterns of activity and links between accounts on different platforms.  He also suggested the company might further limit the ways adults can interact with minors on Facebook\u2019s platforms.  Zuckerberg announced his plan to pivot the company toward more private forms of communication in March, capping months of internal debate over the merits of encryption, three sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters.  Inside the company, privacy engineers and others eager to shed the legacy of the Cambridge Analytica scandal saw the move as a win, as did product managers watching the steady uptick of growth at Facebook\u2019s encrypted messaging service WhatsApp.  But members of Facebook\u2019s safety team familiar with the child exploitation risks argued against the plan, raising deep concerns through the group\u2019s leaders and in large company meetings with senior executives, the sources said.  The United States, Britain and Australia said in their joint letter that they had engaged with Facebook on the issue, but that the company had not committed to addressing their \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the impact of its proposals.  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children also met with Zuckerberg and other senior leaders of Facebook, who offered assurances that child safety was important to them.","1435":"(Reuters) - Cambridge Analytica, the political consultancy at the center of Facebook Inc\u2019s privacy scandal, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the United States late on Thursday.  This past March allegations surfaced that Cambridge Analytica, hired by President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 U.S. election campaign, improperly used data of 87 million Facebook users beginning in 2014.  Cambridge Analytica and its British parent SCL Elections Ltd said earlier this month that they would shut down immediately and begin bankruptcy proceedings after suffering a sharp drop in business.  The petition to file bankruptcy was submitted at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court Southern District of New York and was signed on behalf of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s board by Rebekah and Jennifer Mercer, daughters of billionaire Robert Mercer.  The Mercer family was one of Trump\u2019s biggest donors.  Cambridge Analytica LLC listed assets in the range of $100,001 to $500,000 and liabilities in the range of $1 million to $10 million.

The Massachusetts attorney general launched a similar privacy focused investigation into the company last year after the Cambridge Analytica revelations surfaced, while Washington, D.C.\u2019s attorney general announced in December that he was suing Facebook over the scandal.  California\u2019s investigation began in 2018 as a probe into the Cambridge Analytica scandal but \u201cexpanded over time to an investigation into whether Facebook has violated California law, by among other things, deceiving users and ignoring its own policies in allowing third parties broad access to user data,\u201d the agency said in a court filing.

Facebook\u2019s responses to this second subpoena and set of interrogatories is patently deficient.\u201d  In particular, the attorney general\u2019s office pointed to a failure to look at communications of Facebook founder and CEO Zuckerberg.  \u201cFacebook has not searched the email of the company\u2019s chief executive and chief operating officers for documents responsive to the subpoena,\u201d according to the filing to a California state court in San Francisco County.  The filing paints Facebook as a company that allowed app developers to access non-public information about its users, which they used to \u201cbuild profiles on users, and sell those to third parties.\u201d This includes apps affiliated with Cambridge Analytica.  \u201cQuestions have arisen as to what Facebook knew about this conduct, why it failed to prevent app providers from misusing user data and whether this behavior violated California law,\u201d the attorney general\u2019s office said in the filing.  In July, Facebook agreed to pay a record-breaking $5 billion fine to resolve a Federal Trade Commission probe into its privacy practices and said it would will boost safeguards on user data.

The chips are Intel\u2019s gambit to retain hold of a fast-growing segment of the artificial intelligence computing market but will face competition from similar chips from Nvidia Corp and Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Amazon Web Services unit.  The new chip will help with what researchers call inference, which is the process of taking an artificial intelligence algorithm and putting it to use, for example by tagging friends in photos automatically.  Intel\u2019s processors currently dominate the market for machine learning inference, which analysts at Morningstar believe will be worth $11.8 billion by 2021. In September, Nvidia launched its own inference chip to compete with Intel.  In November, Amazon also said it had created an inference chip. Amazon\u2019s chip is not a direct threat to Intel and Nvidia\u2019s business because it will not be selling the chips. Amazon will sell services to its cloud customers that run atop the chips starting next year. If Amazon relies on its own chips, it could deprive both Nvidia and Intel of a major customer.  Also at the Consumer Electronics Show on Monday, Intel said that Dell Technologies Inc will feature Intel\u2019s next generation of processors in its XPS line of laptops. The so-called 10-nanometer chips have been plagued by delays.  But Navin Shenoy, Intel\u2019s data center chief, reiterated that the new chips will be available in laptops by the 2019 holiday shopping season and in data centers by early next year.

German attorney Chan-jo Jun had filed a complaint with prosecutors in Munich in 2016 and demanded Facebook executives be compelled to comply with anti-hate speech laws by deleting racist or violent postings from its site.

FILE PHOTO: Benoit Coeure, board member of the European Central Bank (ECB), is photographed during an interview with Reuters journalists at the ECB headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany, May 17, 2017. REUTERS\/Kai Pfaffenbach\/File Photo  Benoit Coeure told central bank officials from around the world that the new breed of virtual currencies were largely untested and pledged a tough regulatory approach, adding to warnings from authorities elsewhere.  Facebook\u2019s planned Libra is the most well-known of the stablecoins, cryptocurrencies backed by assets such as traditional money deposits, short-term government securities or gold.  The social media giant\u2019s project, announced in June as it expands into e-commerce, is a high-profile attempt to draw cryptocurrencies into the banking and corporate establishment its creators sought to subvert.  A decade after being born on the web, digital currencies - led by bitcoin - remain a largely unregulated and opaque sector, offering users near-anonymity and associated by many people with hacks, heists and illicit activity.  Enter stablecoins which, by virtue of being underpinned by more established and predictable assets, aim to overcome the extreme volatility that plagues cryptocurrencies and renders them impractical for commerce and payments.  However, authorities around the world have poured cold water on Libra, with concerns centering on what the critics say is its potentially destabilizing effect on the global financial system and potential for use in money laundering.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Coeure\u2019s comments came during an event at the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, where the Group of Seven working group on stablecoins met to discuss regulatory issues posed by the new digital currencies.  \u201cStablecoins are largely untested, especially on the scale required to run a global payment system,\u201d said the European Central Bank executive board member, who chairs the BIS-hosted Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures. \u201cThey give rise to a number of serious risks related to public policy priorities. The bar for regulatory approval will be high.\u201d  On Friday, France and Germany\u2019s finance ministers said at a meeting of euro zone finance ministers that Libra and other cryptocurrencies posed risks to consumers, financial stability and even monetary sovereignty.  The Group of Seven advanced economies warned in July that it would not let Libra proceed until all regulatory concerns have been addressed, saying that a prolonged discussion over the project may first be required.  Stablecoins attracted virtually no attention from politicians and regulators before Libra, partly because of their relatively tiny size. The biggest, Tether, is still only a fraction of the size of bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency.  The Geneva-based Libra Association and Calibra, a Facebook unit that will provide digital wallets for Libra users, gave a presentation at the BIS event.  A Libra spokesman said the event was \u201cconstructive,\u201d adding that the association was committed to engaging with central banks and regulators to realize its goal of a stable and low-cost payment system.  \u201cWe recognize that blockchain is an emerging technology, and that policymakers must carefully consider how its applications fit into their financial system policies,\u201d he said.  David Marcus, Facebook\u2019s top executive overseeing the project, tweeted after Coeure\u2019s remarks that Libra was not a threat to the power of states to control monetary policy.  Libra was designed to be a payment network running \u201con top of existing currencies,\u201d he said. \u201cAs such there\u2019s no new money creation, which will strictly remain the province of sovereign Nations\u201d.","1449":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc's FB.O photo-sharing social network Instagram is back up for some users on Wednesday, after suffering a worldwide outage days after it installed a new head of the app.  According to a check by Reuters, the mobile app and the website, which were temporarily down, are back up and users could post pictures and videos on to their feed.

Since last year, users have been able to forward a message to only five individuals or groups at once, down from an earlier limit of 20.

Facebook hosted a call with advertisers on Tuesday, which included Carolyn Everson, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global marketing solutions, Guy Rosen, vice president of integrity, and Neil Potts, public policy director.  The executives told the group Facebook would include a new data point about the prevalence of hate speech in its Community Standards Enforcement Report, which details how the company takes down content that violates policy, said Barry Lowenthal, chief executive of ad agency The Media Kitchen, who attended the call.  Lowenthal said while he believed Facebook had taken many steps toward tampering down hate speech, the problem has become so large that it may require more drastic measures to fix.  \u201cMaybe they should hit pause on the platform entirely,\u201d Lowenthal said, whose agency works with clients like Vanguard and Loews Hotels. \u201cHow much more can society handle?\u201d  Ford Motor Co F.N and Coca-Cola KO.N are among companies that said they would pause advertising on all social media platforms for at least 30 days.  Facebook announced last week it would label \u201cnewsworthy\u201d content that violates its policies, but the move failed to satisfy organizers of the boycott, who plan to call on more global advertisers to join the campaign.","1456":"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe\u2019s top court will on Thursday rule on the legality of tools companies use to transfer Europeans\u2019 data around the world, in the latest clash between Facebook and Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  If the court finds the mechanisms are illegal, companies, ranging from small businesses to industrial giants, such as Facebook, could have to suspend the data transfers that underpin standard contractual clauses or face hefty fines for breach of EU privacy laws.  \u201cThe Court could upend one, two or all global data transfer mechanisms, sending tens of thousands of companies scrambling, or could validate the existing legal order, providing companies around the world the legal certainty they\u2019ve been seeking for decades,\u201d Caitlin Fennessy, research director at the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP), said.  The industry body\u2019s members include Amazon, AT&T, Cisco, Citi, Facebook, Google, GlaxoSmithKline, HSBC, Huawei, Microsoft, Lockheed Martin and KPMG.  Schrems shot to fame for winning a legal battle in 2015 to overturn previous privacy rules known as Safe Harbour.  It took the European Commission, the EU executive, and the United States more than a year to agree an alternative.  Known as the Privacy Shield, it is designed to protect Europeans\u2019 personal data that is transferred outside the European Union when companies sign contracts with non-EU companies on outsourcing services, including payroll and cloud infrastructure.  The latest case - C-311\/18 Facebook Ireland and Schrems - came before the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) after Schrems challenged Facebook\u2019s use of standard clauses as lacking sufficient data protection safeguards.  Former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations in 2013 of mass U.S. surveillance increased EU concerns about data transfers.  The Irish Data Protection agency, which is Facebook\u2019s lead regulator, took the case to the Irish High Court, which then sought guidance from the CJEU.  Last December a CJEU adviser said such data transfer mechanisms were legal with the caveat that they could be blocked if countries receiving such information fail to meet European data protection standards.  In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), introduced in 2018, seeks to increase individuals\u2019 control over their personal information. Companies that fail to comply are liable to fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover.","1457":"* Facebook down 7 pct as EU, U.S. urge probes of data practices  * Industrials dip as G-20 meeting looms, tariffs in focus  * Fed meeting on tap for Tuesday  * Dow down 1.82 pct, S&P 500 down 1.95 pct, Nasdaq down 2.50 pct (Updates to mid-afternoon, changes byline)  By Chuck Mikolajczak  March 19 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dropped on Monday as a plunge in shares of Facebook led a sell-off in technology stocks on reports that the social media company\u2019s user information was misused.  Facebook shares tumbled 7.1 percent as Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg faced calls from both U.S. and European lawmakers to explain how a consultancy that worked on President Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign gained access to data on 50 million Facebook users.  The stock was set for its worst day since September 2012 and was down about 13 percent from its record high hit on Feb. 1, to put the stock squarely in correction territory, a drop of 10 percent from its high.  Facebook\u2019s plunge weighed heavily on the S&P technology sector, down 2.79 percent, as well as the Nasdaq, off more than 2 percent. Both indexes were on track for their worst daily performance since Feb. 8.  Other major companies with large tech businesses also dropped as recent concerns over regulation in the arena increased. Apple lost 2.24 percent while Alphabet fell 3.8 percent and Microsoft declined 2.5 percent.  \u201cEveryone knows that tech fundamentals are solid, but rumblings like what you are seeing today, that does sort of prompt people to think is this as good as it is going to get or should I take some profits here,\u201d said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 454.01 points, or 1.82 percent, to 24,492.5, the S&P 500 lost 53.57 points, or 1.95 percent, to 2,698.44 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 187.23 points, or 2.5 percent, to 7,294.76.  The S&P once again fell below its 50-day moving average, seen as a technical support level, for the first time since early March. The Nasdaq came about 2 points from its 50-day before paring losses.  Investors were also cautious ahead of the two-day policy meeting by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday.  The market believes the Fed is set to raise interest rates on Wednesday as Thomson Reuters data shows traders expect a quarter-point hike to be a certainty. Investors are now grappling with the question of whether an improving economy could lead to more hikes than anticipated.  \u201cSome of the more salient questions investors have is has the tone of the Fed, which this time last year was certainly more skewed towards being dovish, has it now extended to becoming more hawkish?\u201d said Freedman.  Industrials fell 1.45 percent against the backdrop of worries about a global trade war, which are set to dominate a two-day G20 meeting starting later in Argentina.  Selling was broad, with each of the 11 major S&P sectors in the red. The CBOE Volatility index was up 5.48 points at 21.28, in one of its sharpest gains since the market sell-off in February.  Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 5.73-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.73-to-1 ratio favored decliners.","1458":"BERN (Reuters) - The Facebook-led FB.O Libra cryptocurrency project must meet the highest standards for combating money laundering and terrorism financing if it is to get off the ground, a senior U.S. Treasury official said on Tuesday.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Any cryptocurrency project, including Geneva-based Libra, operating in all or substantial parts of the United States will clearly have to satisfy U.S. regulatory standards, U.S. Under Secretary of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker told reporters in the Swiss capital.  \u201cWhether it\u2019s bitcoin, Ethereum, Libra, our message is the same to all of these companies: anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism has to be built into your design from the get-go,\u201d Mandelker said.  She was speaking after meeting Swiss government officials and representatives from the Bank for International Settlements and other international financial bodies to discuss cryptocurrencies including the planned Libra project, which is to be launched by a Swiss-based association.  While the digital currency industry has paid tremendous attention to developing the underlying technology, much of the industry has paid far too little attention to ensuring that the networks they are building do not enable terrorists and other bad actors to hide and move money, Mandelker said.  The Treasury official said she would meet Switzerland\u2019s financial market supervisor FINMA on Tuesday, where discussing not only the application of proper anti-money laundering safeguards but also taking enforcement actions against companies flouting those rules would be a priority.  FINMA in August granted Switzerland\u2019s first banking and securities licenses to two blockchain service providers and has built up a digital currency hub nicknamed the \u201cCrypto Valley\u201d.  \u201cSwitzerland, like a number of other countries, has promoted itself as a hub for fintech and for innovation, and so of course any country that promotes itself in that way -- in my view, it\u2019s incumbent upon that country to take these particular concerns at the highest level in(to) the utmost regard,\u201d she added.  The Libra project was still in very early stages of thinking through steps to prevent such crimes, she said, adding Swiss officials had similar views.  \u201cThe Libra Association maintains that financial inclusion, regulatory compliance, and consumer protection are not competing objectives,\u201d Dante Disparte, a spokesman for Libra said.  He added the association welcomed the public policy dialogue and multi-stakeholder process.  Digital currencies such as Libra raise serious concerns and must be regulated as tightly as possible to ensure they do not upset the world\u2019s financial system, Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers had said in July.","1459":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc\u2019s decisions to allow controversial posts by President Donald Trump established a \u201cterrible precedent\u201d that could allow the platform to be \u201cweaponized to suppress voting,\u201d an external civil rights audit found on Wednesday.  The report, which Facebook commissioned two years ago, said the social network has not done enough to protect users from discrimination, falsehoods and incitement to violence, adding to pressure on the company in the midst of an advertiser boycott.  The findings come as more than 900 advertisers, including major brands such as Coca-Cola Co and Unilever Plc, have joined a boycott started by major U.S. civil rights groups, including the Anti-Defamation League and the NAACP, to pressure Facebook to take concrete steps to block hate speech.  \u201cMany in the civil rights community have become disheartened, frustrated and angry after years of engagement where they implored the company to do more to advance equality and fight discrimination, while also safeguarding free expression,\u201d the auditors wrote.  Facebook has taken a hands-off approach to political speech compared to rivals, notably leaving untouched posts by Trump in recent weeks which were flagged by its rival Twitter Inc for falsehoods and incitement of violence.  One Trump tweet, labeled by Twitter as violating its policy against \u201cglorifying violence,\u201d said: \u201cAny difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d  The auditors expressed \u201csignificant concern\u201d about the company\u2019s steadfast commitment to protect a particular definition of free expression, even where that has meant allowing harmful and divisive rhetoric that amplifies hate speech and threatens civil rights.  FILE PHOTO: Facebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies at a House Financial Services Committee hearing in Washington, U.S., October 23, 2019. REUTERS\/Erin Scott  By declining to hold politicians to the same rules as everyone else, Facebook created a \u201chierarchy of speech\u201d that \u201cprivileges certain voices\u201d over others, they wrote.  Racial justice group Color Of Change, which pushed for Facebook to have an audit and helped organize the advertising boycott, said the report correctly assessed the company\u2019s approach as \u201cincremental and counterproductive.\u201d  Muslim Advocates, which also pushed for the audit, said Wednesday it confirmed Facebook enables anti-Muslim violence.  Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg defended Facebook\u2019s policy of not fact-checking political ads in a speech at Georgetown University last year where he cited protests against the Vietnam War.  \u201cAllowing the Trump posts to remain establishes a terrible precedent that may lead other politicians and non-politicians to spread false information about legal voting methods, which would effectively allow the platform to be weaponized to suppress voting,\u201d the auditors said.  Facebook commissioned the audit in 2018 as part of its response to a range of criticism over issues such as data privacy, voter suppression, incitement of violence and a lack of transparency in political advertising. The audit was led by Laura Murphy, a former director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s legislative office.  The company did not immediately indicate specific steps it would take in response to the findings but issued a statement attributed to Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg describing the audit as a \u201creally important process for our company.\u201d  \u201cThe audit looked at a wide range of civil rights issues, including our policies against hate. There are no quick fixes to these issues \u2014 nor should there be,\u201d Sandberg said. \u201cWhat has become increasingly clear is that we have a long way to go.\u201d  She said Facebook would hire a civil rights leader, as previously discussed with ad boycott leaders, but stopped short of their demand that the role be an executive-level position.  Organizers of the advertising boycott met for more than an hour via video conference with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Sandberg on Tuesday. After the meeting, activists said they saw \u201cno commitment to action\u201d from the company.","1460":"Facebook and Twitter logos are seen on a shop window in Malaga, Spain, June 4, 2018.

Roskomnadzor, the watchdog, was quoted as saying that Twitter and Facebook had not explained how and when they would comply with legislation that requires all servers used to store Russians\u2019 personal data to be located in Russia.  The agency\u2019s head, Alexander Zharov, was quoted as saying the companies have a month to provide information or else action would be taken against them.  Russia has introduced tougher internet laws in the last five years, requiring search engines to delete some search results, messaging services to share encryption keys with security services and social networks to store Russian users\u2019 personal data on servers within the country.  At the moment, the only tools Russia has to enforce its data rules are fines that typically only come to a few thousand dollars or blocking the offending online services, which is an option fraught with technical difficulties.  However, sources in November told Reuters that Moscow plans to impose stiffer fines on technology firms that fail to comply with Russian laws.","1461":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook Inc FB.O said on Friday it had deleted accounts originating in Iran that attracted more than 1 million U.S. and British followers, its latest effort to combat disinformation activity on its platform.

REUTERS\/Regis Duvignau\/Illustration\/File Photo  Social media companies are struggling to stop attempts by people inside and outside the United States to spread false information on their platforms with goals ranging from destabilizing elections by stoking hardline positions to supporting propaganda campaigns.  The fake Facebook accounts originating in Iran mostly targeted American liberals, according to the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab, a thinktank that works with Facebook to study propaganda online.  Facebook said it removed 82 pages, groups and accounts on Facebook and Instagram that represented themselves as being American or British citizens, then posted on \u201cpolitically charged\u201d topics such as race relations, opposition to U.S. President Donald Trump and immigration, Facebook\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, said in a blog post.  In total, the removed accounts attracted more than 1 million followers. The Iran-linked posts were amplified through less than $100 in advertising on Facebook and Instagram, Facebook said.  While the accounts originated in Iran, it was unclear if they were linked to the Tehran government, according to Facebook, which shared the information with researchers, other technology companies and the British and U.S. governments.  The Iranian U.N. mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The action follows takedowns in August by Facebook, Twitter Inc TWTR.N and Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O of hundreds of accounts linked to Iranian propaganda.  The latest operation was more sophisticated in some instances, making it difficult to identify, Gleicher said during a press conference phone call on Friday.  Although most of accounts and pages had existed only since earlier this year, they attracted more followers than the accounts removed in August, some of which dated back to 2013. The previously suspended Iranian accounts and pages garnered roughly 983,000 followers before being removed.  \u201cIt looks like the intention was to embed in highly active and engaged communities by posting inflammatory content, and then insert messaging on Saudi and Israel which amplified the Iranian government\u2019s narrative,\u201d said Ben Nimmo, an information defense fellow with the Digital Forensic Research Lab.  \u201cMost of the posts concerned divisive issues in the U.S., and posted a liberal or progressive viewpoint, especially on race relations and police violence,\u201d Nimmo said.  Social media companies have increasingly targeted foreign interference on their platforms following criticism that they did not do enough to detect, halt and disclose Russian efforts to use their platforms to influence the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential race.  Iran and Russia have denied allegations that they have used social media platforms to launch disinformation campaigns.","1462":"July 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks opened higher on Monday, led by technology stocks, as investors eyed fresh trade developments between the United States and China in a busy week of corporate earnings, which include reports from Facebook and Amazon.

About 20 officials, wearing black jackets with \u201cICO Enforcement\u201d on them, arrived at the firm\u2019s central London offices on Friday evening soon after a High Court judge granted a search warrant sought by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO).  The officials concluded the search around 0300 GMT on Saturday. \u201cWe will now need to assess and consider the evidence before deciding the next steps and coming to any conclusions,\u201d an ICO spokesperson said in a statement.  The officials, who were let into the building by security guards, were seen checking books and papers through the windows of the second-floor offices on London\u2019s busy New Oxford Street, a Reuters witness said.  Elizabeth Denham, head of the ICO, sought the warrant after a whistleblower said Cambridge Analytica had gathered private information of 50 million Facebook users to support Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.  Britain is investigating whether Facebook, the world\u2019s largest social media network, did enough to protect data.  U.S. lawmakers on Friday asked Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to come to Congress to explain to explain how the data got into Cambridge Analytica\u2019s hands, adding to pressure on the firm, which is under fire from investors and advertisers.  Separately on Friday, Britain\u2019s Guardian newspaper said a former Cambridge Analytica political consultant had accused the company\u2019s management of misleading the British public about work it did for a pro-Brexit group before the vote to leave the European Union.  Brittany Kaiser, a business development director at the company from 2014 until earlier this year, told the Guardian that Cambridge Analytica carried out data-crunching and analysis work for Leave.EU, while publicly denying it was doing so.  Arron Banks, a major donor to Leave.EU, told the newspaper that Leave.EU did not receive any data or work from Cambridge Analytica although the UK Independence Party, which also campaigned for Brexit, gave the firm some of its data which the firm analyzed.  \u201cBut it was not used in the Brexit campaign. Cambridge Analytica tried to make me pay for that work but I refused. It had nothing to do with us,\u201d Banks was quoted as saying.

CEO Alexander Nix\u2019s comments, which could not be verified, are potentially a further problem for Facebook Inc as it faces lawmakers\u2019 scrutiny in the United States and Europe over Cambridge Analytica\u2019s improper use of 50 million Facebook users\u2019 personal data to target voters.  The social media network\u2019s shares fell for a second day, closing down 2.5 percent, as investors worried that its dealings with Cambridge Analytica might damage its reputation, deter advertisers and invite restrictive regulation. The company has lost nearly $50 billion of its stock market value over the last two days.  Cambridge Analytica\u2019s board of directors suspended Nix on Tuesday, shortly before the second part of British broadcaster Channel 4\u2019s expose of the firm\u2019s methods.  In the program Nix describes questionable practices used to influence foreign elections and said his firm did all the research, analytics and targeting of voters for Trump\u2019s digital and TV campaigns. He also boasts he met Trump when he was the Republican presidential candidate \u201cmany times\u201d.  Nix\u2019s comments \u201cdo not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation,\u201d Cambridge Analytica said in a statement on Tuesday.  Cambridge Analytica has denied all the media claims and said it deleted the data after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.  Brad Parscale, the 2016 Trump campaign\u2019s main digital adviser who dealt regularly with Cambridge Analytica, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Nix\u2019s claims.  Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and now senior adviser, oversaw the Trump campaign\u2019s digital operations. One former Trump adviser said Kushner brought Cambridge Analytica into the 2016 campaign effort. Kushner\u2019s lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie told the Washington Post on Tuesday that in 2014 conservative strategist Steve Bannon, who would go on to be Trump's White House adviser, oversaw the firm's early efforts to collect Facebook data to build detailed profiles on millions of American voters. (wapo.st\/2HOTQNu)  Bannon approved spending nearly $1 million to acquire data, including Facebook profiles, in 2014, Wylie told the Post. It is unclear whether Bannon knew how Cambridge Analytica was obtaining the Facebook data, the Post reported.  Bannon, who served on Cambridge Analytica\u2019s board, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.  U.S. law bans foreigners from making contributions or spending money on behalf of a U.S. election campaign but it was not illegal for the Trump campaign to retain Cambridge Analytica\u2019s services, according to Bradley Smith, a former Republican member of the U.S. Federal Election Commission.  \u201cThe fact that they are a British company doesn\u2019t add anything to the analysis unless they were giving their services away for free or charging below-market rates,\u201d said Smith, now a professor at the Capital University Law School in Columbus, Ohio.  FTC REVIEW, LAWSUIT  U.S. and European lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how Cambridge Analytica gained access to user data in 2014 and why Facebook failed to inform its users, raising broader industry questions about consumer privacy.  Slideshow ( 9 images )  Facebook said it had been told by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the leading U.S. consumer regulator, that it would receive a letter this week with questions about the data acquired by Cambridge Analytica. It said it had no indication of a formal investigation.  \u201cThe entire company is outraged we were deceived,\u201d Facebook said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cWe are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people\u2019s information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.\u201d  The FTC is reviewing whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent decree it reached with the authority over its privacy practices, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.  If the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree, it has the power to fine the company thousands of dollars a day per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars.  Slideshow ( 9 images )  Facebook was also hit on Tuesday in a San Francisco court by the first of what could be many lawsuits by shareholders claiming to suffer losses because the company misled them about its ability to protect user data. The company could also soon face lawsuits on behalf of users whose personal information was exposed.  Facebook and its peers Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Twitter already face a backlash from users and lawmakers over their role during the U.S. presidential election by allowing the spread of false information that might have swayed voters toward Trump.  Fear of increased regulation hurt other social media firms on Tuesday. Shares of Snap Inc fell 2.5 percent and Twitter Inc fell more than 10 percent.  FOREIGN INFLUENCE  U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, called on Tuesday for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify in Congress. Congressional staff said the company would brief U.S. Senate and House aides on Wednesday.  A Congressional official said House Intelligence Committee Democrats plan to interview Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Wylie. The committee interviewed Nix by video teleconference, according to the Congressional official, but a transcript of that interview has not yet been made public.  The Senate Intelligence Committee, which is conducting a long-term investigation of alleged Russian interference in U.S. politics and a detailed examination of U.S. election security precautions, would carry out its own inquiry of Cambridge Analytica, a Congressional official with direct knowledge of the investigation said.  The White House said it welcomed inquiries, and that the president believes that Americans\u2019 privacy should be protected.  PERSONAL INFORMATION  In Britain, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, an independent authority set up to uphold information rights in the public interest, was seeking a warrant from a judge to search the offices of London-based Cambridge Analytica. It was unclear late on Tuesday whether it had obtained it.  Created in 2013, Cambridge Analytica markets itself as a source of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients.  According to the New York Times, it was launched with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by Bannon.  Facebook says the data were harvested by a British academic, Aleksandr Kogan, who created an app on the platform that was downloaded by 270,000 people, providing access not only to their own personal data but also data from their friends.  Facebook said Kogan then violated its policies by passing the data to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook has since suspended both the consulting firm and SCL (Strategic Communication Laboratories), a government and military contractor.  Facebook said it had been told that the data were destroyed. Kogan was not immediately reachable for comment.","1467":"(Reuters) - The Trump administration accused Facebook Inc on Thursday of selling targeted advertising that discriminated on the basis of race, in violation of the U.S. Fair Housing Act.

A spokesman for the department declined to comment on the details of the discussions.  The social media giant last week agreed to overhaul its paid advertising platform as part of a wide-ranging settlement with U.S. civil rights groups, which had filed five separate lawsuits accusing the company of enabling discrimination in advertising.  Under U.S. law, including the federal Fair Housing Act, it is illegal to publish certain types of ads - including online ads - if they indicate a preference based on race, religion, sex or other specified classifications.  As part of last week\u2019s settlement, Facebook said it would create a new advertising portal for ads linked to housing and employment that would limit targeting options for advertisers. It also pledged to build a tool that would allow users to search all current housing ads listed in the United States, regardless of whether the ads were directed at them.  The government charge said Facebook enabled advertisers to exclude people whom the social network\u2019s data classified as parents, non-American-born, non-Christian, or a variety of other interests that closely align with the Fair Housing Act\u2019s protected classes.  \u201cFacebook is discriminating against people based upon who they are and where they live,\u201d Department Secretary Ben Carson said. \u201cUsing a computer to limit a person\u2019s housing choices can be just as discriminatory as slamming a door in someone\u2019s face.\u201d  The Facebook logo is reflected on a woman's glasses in this photo illustration taken June 3, 2018. REUTERS\/Regis Duvignau\/Illustration  GROWING DISCONTENT  The Housing Department has also requested information about ad targeting from Twitter and Google, Facebook\u2019s main competition for online advertising dollars, but has not launched an investigation into either company, the spokesman said.  Both Twitter and Google denied allowing discriminatory advertising, although they said that they do allow advertisers to target by gender.  Researchers have told Reuters that gender targeting could potentially be a violation of the Fair Housing Act.  Discrimination against transgender individuals was prohibited, Google said.  \u201cWe\u2019ve had policies in place for many years that prohibit targeting ads on the basis of sensitive categories,\u201d Google said in a statement.  Advertising practices at Facebook, the world\u2019s largest social network with 2.7 billion users and $56 billion in annual revenue, have been in the spotlight for two years amid growing discontent over its approach to privacy and user data.  News organization ProPublica reported as far back as 2016 that advertisers could target ads through Facebook based on people\u2019s self-reported jobs, even if the job was \u201cJew hater.\u201d  ProPublica later reported that it was able to buy discriminatory housing ads and slip them past Facebook\u2019s review process, despite the company\u2019s claims it was blocking such ads.  Since then, Facebook has faced legal pressure over the issue from the National Fair Housing Alliance, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Communications Workers of America, among others.  The ACLU welcomed the complaint, saying it would add \u201cmuch-needed pressure\u201d on the company on top of last week\u2019s settlement. It encouraged the department to investigate other online ad targeting platforms.  \u201cAlthough the settlement we reached with Facebook will result in removing many of the most troubling of Facebook\u2019s advertising practices, there is more work to be done,\u201d Galen Sherwin, an ACLU attorney, said in a statement.  The charge will be heard by a judge who can award damages for harm caused by the discrimination, along with fines, injunctions and other relief.","1468":"FILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is displayed on a smartphone in this illustration taken January 6, 2020.

Trump, without providing evidence, has repeatedly accused social media companies and Google of suppressing conservative voices online.  The FTC's new jurisdiction results from an agreement that allows the U.S. Justice Department to take the reins of a similar Google probe, the WSJ report on.wsj.com\/2XvgaEl said, citing people familiar with the matter.  Reuters and other media reported on Friday that the Justice Department may investigate Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc , to determine whether the technology company violated laws to ensure fair competition.  Shares of Alphabet fell as much as 7% on Monday, their biggest drop outside earnings since April 2011.  U.S. antitrust regulators have divided oversight of Amazon.com Inc and Google, putting Amazon under the watch of the FTC and Google under the Justice Department, the Washington Post reported on Saturday.  Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while the FTC declined to comment.  Last month, Facebook co-founder and former Mark Zuckerberg roommate Chris Hughes called for the break up of the social network in an opinion piece in the New York Times.  He wrote that company CEO Zuckerberg had unprecedented power and said U.S. regulators needed to take action. At the time, Facebook rejected the calls for a breakup.

The investment in time and money is a significant expansion of a plan to help newsrooms in the U.S. and abroad create and sustain viable business models to survive, the company said on Tuesday.  Unlike earlier investments in the news business, this latest round is distinguished by how it is not tied to Facebook-related products, recipients of the investments say.  Earlier rounds of investments in the news business were designed to encourage publishers to rely on delivering its products over Facebook, which eventually hurt many news organizations when Facebook\u2019s strategies shifted.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue fighting fake news, misinformation, and low quality news on Facebook,\u201d Campbell Brown, Facebook\u2019s vice president of Global News Partnerships said in a statement. \u201cBut we also have an opportunity, and a responsibility, to help local news organizations grow and thrive.\u201d  Critics have slammed Facebook for its role in providing a platform for hate speech, misinformation and political meddling.  The first round of investments in the U.S. will help bolster resources for local reporting, help research how to use technology to improve news gathering and create new products, recruit \u201ctrainee community journalists\u201d and place them in local newsrooms and also help fund a program modeled after the Peace Corp, which will place 1,000 journalists in local newsrooms over five years.  The recipients of the investments include the Pulitzer Center, Report for America, Knight-Lenfest Local News Transformation Fund, the Local Media Association and Local Media Consortium, the American Journalism Project and the Community News Project.

The president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. sought such volunteers for this \u201cArmy for Trump\u201d in a September video that racked up millions of views on social media.

The company has struggled to settle on an approach to political ads. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg last year cast himself as a steadfast defender of free speech for refusing to impose restrictions favored by the company\u2019s peers.  Zuckerberg gave some ground last month, saying in an announcement pitched as the company\u2019s final word on election policies that Facebook would block new political ads in the week before the election.  Facebook subsequently said it would reject ads that prematurely claim victory or suggest that official results are invalid.  The company also announced more a proactive approach to organic falsehoods, which election experts have warned could be the biggest threat on Election Day.  It said it would respond to candidates or parties making premature claims of victory by adding a label saying the election has not yet been called and showing notifications at the top of news feed with authoritative information about the state of the race.  Posts from presidential candidates contesting the official outcome would get a label showing the declared winner\u2019s name, the company said.","1477":"WASHINGTON, April 25 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc said Wednesday it has declined an invitation to testify at a U.S. House of Representatives hearing Thursday on filtering practices by social media companies, a company spokesman said.

U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign event at MBS International Airport, in Freeland, Michigan, U.S., September 10, 2020. REUTERS\/Jonathan Ernst  Voting by mail has a long history of reliability in the United States, serving as the primary method of voting in Colorado, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Hawaii, which automatically send registered voters mail-in ballots. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, California, Nevada, New Jersey, Vermont, and Washington, D.C. have introduced the same procedure for the 2020 vote ( here ) .  Benjamin Hovland, commissioner of the independent, bipartisan U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC, here , www.eac.gov\/about-the-useac ) echoed to Reuters via phone that \u201cin more states than ever, election authorities will automatically send a ballot to each registered voter.\u201d  According to Reuters\u2019 calculations, there are an estimated 44.2 million registered voters, or about half the number mentioned by President Trump, in the 10 states and jurisdictions automatically sending out ballots for the Nov. 3 election.  Reuters found this number by adding up the latest available voter registration statistics for Colorado ( here ); Hawaii, ( here ); Oregon ( here ); Utah ( here ); Washington ( here ); California ( here ); Washington, D.C ( here ); Nevada ( here ); New Jersey ( here ); and Vermont ( here ).  \u201cOn the states where these ballots are sent automatically, those were state-legislated decisions to make those policies,\u201d Commissioner Hovland said, adding that \u201cthose states have implemented security measures on their respective mail-in processes.\u201d  For the remaining states not sending out proactive ballots, Hovland noted \u201cvotes still require an affirmative request from the voter.\u201d The millions of voters in these states would have to actively solicit or request a ballot.  It is possible that Trump\u2019s 80 million unsolicited ballot claim stemmed from an Aug. 14 analysis from the New York Times ( here ), which stated that experts predict \u201croughly 80 million mail ballots will flood election offices this fall.\u201d  The president first mentioned this figure during his Labor Day press conference on Sept. 7, referring to \u201cthe issuance of 80 million ballots, unrequested\u201d as \u201cthe dirtiest fight of all\u201d ( here ).  Linking the high volume of \u201cunsolicited\u201d mail ballots to voter fraud, he said, \u201cPeople are going to get ballots; they\u2019re going to say, \u2018What am I doing?\u2019 And then they\u2019re going to harvest. They\u2019re going to do all the things.\u201d  The claim feeds into a narrative echoed by President Trump that mail-in voting, expected to nearly double due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will increase voter fraud ( here ).  After weeks of repeatedly raising concerns about mail-in voting, Trump on Aug. 4 called Florida\u2019s election system \u201cSafe and Secure, Tried and True\u201d and urged voters in the Republican state to vote by any means, including by mail ( here).  Experts say that election fraud is very rare in the United States, where nearly one in four voters cast a mail-in or absentee ballot in 2016 (here).  There are multiple layers of security in place for mail-in ballots, also known as \u201cabsentee\u201d ballots, including the Electronic Registration Information Center ( www.ericstates.org ) and adherence to the National Voter Registration Act\u2019s list of maintenance procedures ( here , here).

Facebook complied with a government request in April to significantly increase its censorship of \u201canti-state\u201d posts for local users, but Vietnam asked the company again in August to step up its restrictions of critical posts, the official said.  \u201cWe made an agreement in April. Facebook has upheld our end of the agreement, and we expected the government of Vietnam to do the same,\u201d said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity citing the sensitivity of the subject.  \u201cThey have come back to us and sought to get us to increase the volume of content that we\u2019re restricting in Vietnam. We\u2019ve told them no. That request came with some threats about what might happen if we didn\u2019t.\u201d  The official said the threats included shutting down Facebook altogether in Vietnam, a major market for the social media company where it earns revenue of nearly $1 billion, according to two sources familiar with the numbers.  Facebook has faced mounting pressure from governments over its content policies, including threats of new regulations and fines. But it has avoided a ban in all but the few places where it has never been allowed to operate, such as China.  In Vietnam, despite sweeping economic reform and increasing openness to social change, the ruling Communist Party retains tight control of media and tolerates little opposition. The country ranks fifth from bottom in a global ranking of press freedom compiled by Reporters Without Borders.  Vietnam\u2019s foreign ministry said in response to questions from Reuters that Facebook should abide by local laws and cease \u201cspreading information that violates traditional Vietnamese customs and infringes upon state interests\u201d.  A spokeswoman for Facebook said it had faced additional pressure from Vietnam to censor more content in recent months.  \u2018CLEAR RESPONSIBILITY\u2019  Facebook, which serves about 60 million users in Vietnam as the main platform for both e-commerce and expressions of political dissent, is under constant government scrutiny.  Reuters exclusively reported in April that Facebook\u2019s local servers in Vietnam were taken offline early this year until it complied with the government\u2019s demands.  Facebook has long faced criticism from rights group for being too compliant with government censorship requests.  \u201cHowever, we will do everything we can to ensure that our services remain available so people can continue to express themselves,\u201d the spokeswoman said.  Vietnam has tried to launch home-grown social media networks to compete with Facebook, but none has reached any meaningful level of popularity. The Facebook official said the company had not seen an exodus of Vietnamese users to the local platforms.  The official said Facebook had been subject to a \u201c14-month-long negative media campaign\u201d in state-controlled Vietnamese press before arriving at the current impasse.  Asked about Vietnam\u2019s threat to shut down Facebook, rights group Amnesty International said the fact it had not yet been banned after defying the Vietnamese government\u2019s threats showed that the company could do more to resist Hanoi\u2019s demands.  \u201cFacebook has a clear responsibility to respect human rights wherever they operate in the world and Vietnam is no exception,\u201d Ming Yu Hah, Amnesty\u2019s deputy regional director for campaigns, said. \u201cFacebook are prioritising profits in Vietnam, and failing to respect human rights\u201d.

The logo of Facebook is pictured during the Viva Tech start-up and technology summit in Paris, France, May 25, 2018. REUTERS\/Charles Platiau  Some advertisers have tested the Brand Collabs Manager, which identifies video makers that may be good fits for product placement or endorsement deals.  Facebook also said it was allowing more content creators to run ad breaks in longer videos, and offer subscriptions for $4.99 a month to fans. Subscribers receive perks, such as exclusive behind-the-scenes footage.  Facebook is not keeping a cut of partnerships or subscriptions during testing, and it is uncertain about eventual fees, company Vice President Fidji Simo told Reuters in an interview last week.  The company has long been wary of polluting newer experiences, such as video, with ads and paid options. But it has deployed the moneymaking features in recent months after a year in which many videomakers saw their YouTube earnings clipped.  YouTube, part of Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, tightened revenue-sharing policies last year after advertisers including Procter & Gamble Co PG.N expressed concern about automated ad-buying tools that had turned them into sponsors of unflattering content.  Both Facebook and YouTube are racing to attract high-quality content, which would help them win over the $200 billion spent annually on TV advertising globally.  Facebook\u2019s appeal to video makers has been limited by the few opportunities they have had to turn viewership on the service into revenue. For instance, YouTube added a partnership match tool in 2016 via acquisition.  YouTube plans to update its commercialization options later this week as 30,000 members of the online video industry, including fans, gather for the VidCon festival in Anaheim, California beginning Wednesday.  Simo acknowledged that video makers want even more alternatives. Facebook already is testing how to promote new videos as \u201clive events\u201d that could become big destinations for advertising, she said.  Many creators have asked for a tool to sell merchandise they develop to fans, Simo said. For now, Simo said the company plans to do a \u201csmall test\u201d this year of selling third-party products featured in videos.  Separately, Facebook unveiled on Tuesday polling and quizzing features for anyone to produce game shows. The tools follow the success of startup Intermedia Labs Inc, whose HQ trivia app regularly attracts 1 million contestants to daily shows.","1485":"A Facebook sign is seen during the China Digital Entertainment Expo and Conference (ChinaJoy) in Shanghai, China August 3, 2018. REUTERS\/Aly Song  (Reuters) - UK advertisers seeking to run political ads on Facebook Inc FB.O must now confirm their identity, location and reveal who paid for the ad, the social network said on Thursday as it faces increasing scrutiny following the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  Starting Thursday, ads related to politics will be housed in an \"Ad Library\" for seven years and advertisers will be prevented from running a political ad if they aren't authorized, Facebook director of product management Rob Leathern said in a blog here post.  Britain\u2019s parliament has called for tech firms to be made liable for disseminating misleading political information and targeting citizens using data manipulation, in the wake of major political events such as Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union in 2016.  Facebook is being investigated by lawmakers in Britain after consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, obtained personal data of 87 million Facebook users from a researcher.  The social media company said it would, however, exempt select UK news organizations from housing their content in Facebook\u2019s Ad Library. The exemption will be expanded in the United States next year, it said.  The exemption is a partial reversal to Facebook\u2019s earlier decision to include ads in its Ad Library from news organizations mentioning political figures, elections or issues of national importance.  A group of news publishers had written a letter in June to Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, protesting the social network\u2019s inclusion of news content in its new policies meant for labeling and archiving all political ads.","1486":"FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen placed on a keyboard in this illustration taken March 25, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  LONDON (Reuters) - British finance minister Rishi Sunak plans to drop a tax on technology companies such as Facebook FB.O and Google GOOGL.O because it does not raise much money and could hurt a push for a U.S. trade deal, the Mail on Sunday newspaper said.  Britain introduced the digital services tax in April after slow progress in global negotiations over how to tax tech giants, many of which are U.S. companies.  The tax is expected to raise about 500 million pounds ($654 million) a year for Britain\u2019s public finances.  That represents only a fraction of the 200 billion pounds in extra debt the country has racked up since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The tax is also a potential impediment to a post-Brexit bilateral trade deal between Britain and the United States.  France and other countries have adopted or are considering similar taxes.  No one was immediately available for comment at Britain\u2019s finance ministry.  The Mail on Sunday quoted a finance ministry representative as saying: \u201cWe\u2019ve been clear it\u2019s a temporary tax that will be removed once an appropriate global solution is in place, and we continue to work with our international partners to reach that goal.\u201d","1487":"Inclusion of diary items does not necessarily mean that Reuters will file a story based on the event.

Reuters saw dozens of online posts from employees critical of Zuckerberg's decision to leave Trump's most inflammatory verbiage unchallenged where Twitter had labeled it. Some top managers participated in the protest, reminiscent of a 2018 walkout at Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google over sexual harassment.  It was a rare case of staff publicly taking their CEO to task, with one employee tweeting that thousands participated. Among them were all seven engineers on the team maintaining the React code library which supports Facebook\u2019s apps.  \u201cFacebook\u2019s recent decision to not act on posts that incite violence ignores other options to keep our community safe. We implore the Facebook leadership to #TakeAction,\u201d they said in a joint statement published on Twitter.  \u201cMark is wrong, and I will endeavor in the loudest possible way to change his mind,\u201d wrote Ryan Freitas, identified on Twitter as director of product design for Facebook\u2019s News Feed. He added he had mobilized \u201c50+ likeminded folks\u201d to lobby for internal change.  A Facebook employee said Zuckerberg\u2019s weekly Friday question-and-answer session would be moved up this week to Tuesday.  Katie Zhu, a product manager at Instagram, tweeted a screenshot showing she had entered \u201c#BLACKLIVESMATTER\u201d to describe her request for time off as part of the walkout.  Facebook Inc FB.O will allow employees participating in the protest to take the time off without drawing down their vacation days, spokesman Andy Stone said.  Separately, online therapy company Talkspace said it ended partnership discussions with Facebook. Talkspace CEO Oren Frank tweeted he would \u201cnot support a platform that incites violence, racism, and lies.\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  SOCIAL JUSTICE  Tech workers at companies including Facebook, Google, and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O have pursued social justice issues in recent years, urging the companies to change policies.  Employees \u201crecognize the pain many of our people are feeling right now, especially our Black community,\u201d Stone wrote in a text.  \u201cWe encourage employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership. As we face additional difficult decisions around content ahead, we\u2019ll continue seeking their honest feedback.\u201d  Last week, nationwide unrest erupted after the death of a black man, George Floyd, in police custody in Minneapolis last Monday. Video footage showed a white officer kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes before he died.  On Friday, Twitter Inc TWTR.N affixed a warning label to a Trump tweet that included the phrase \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" Twitter said it violated rules against glorifying violence but was left up as a public interest exception.  Facebook declined to act on the same message, and Zuckerberg sought to distance his company from the fight between the president and Twitter.  On Friday, Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post that while he found Trump\u2019s remarks \u201cdeeply offensive,\u201d they did not violate company policy against incitements to violence and people should know whether the government was planning to deploy force.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Zuckerberg\u2019s post also said Facebook had been in touch with the White House to explain its policies.  Twitter used the same label as for Trump on Monday to hide a message by Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida that likened protesters to terrorists and called for them to be hunted down \u201clike we do those in the Middle East.\u201d  Gaetz said in response he would \u201csee\u201d Twitter in the Judiciary Committee.  Some of Facebook\u2019s dissenting employees have praised Twitter for its response over Trump. Others, like Jason Toff, a director of product management and former head of short-form video app Vine, started organizing fundraisers for racial justice groups in Minnesota. Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook on Monday the company would contribute an additional $10 million to social justice causes.  Toff tweeted: \u201cI work at Facebook and I am not proud of how we\u2019re showing up. The majority of coworkers I\u2019ve spoken to feel the same way. We are making our voice heard.\u201d","1489":"Reuters Fact Check.

After easily beating Wall Street expectations, shares traded up 7.1 percent after the bell at $171, paring a month-long decline that began with Facebook\u2019s disclosure in March that consultancy Cambridge Analytica had harvested data belonging to millions of users.  The Cambridge Analytica scandal, affecting up to 87 million users and prompting several apologies from Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, generated calls for regulation and for users to leave the social network, but there was no indication advertisers immediately changed their spending.  \u201cEverybody keeps talking about how bad things are for Facebook, but this earnings report to me is very positive, and reiterates that Facebook is fine, and they\u2019ll get through this,\u201d said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company. His firm holds about 73,000 shares in Facebook.  Facebook\u2019s quarterly profit beat analysts\u2019 estimates, as a 49 percent jump in quarterly revenue outpaced a 39 percent rise in expenses from a year earlier. The mobile ad business grew on a push to add more video content.  Facebook said monthly active users in the first quarter rose to 2.2 billion, up 13 percent from a year earlier and matching expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  The company reversed last quarter\u2019s decline in the number of daily active users in the United States and Canada, saying it had 185 million users there, up from 184 million in the fourth quarter.  The results are a bright spot for the world\u2019s largest social network amid months of negative headlines about the company\u2019s handling of personal information, its role in elections and its fueling of violence in developing countries.  Facebook, which generates revenue primarily by selling advertising personalized to its users, has demonstrated for several quarters how resilient its business model can be as long as users keep coming back to scroll through its News Feed and watch its videos.  It is spending to ensure users are not scared away by scandals. Chief Financial Officer David Wehner told analysts on a call that expenses this year would grow between 50 percent and 60 percent, up from a prior range of 45 percent to 60 percent.  Much of Facebook\u2019s ramp-up in spending is for safety and security, Wehner said. The category includes efforts to root out fake accounts, scrub hate speech and take down violent videos.  FILE PHOTO: Silhouettes of laptop users are seen next to a screen projection of Facebook logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  Facebook said it ended the first quarter with 27,742 employees, up 48 percent from a year earlier.  \u201cSo long as profits continue to grow at a rapid rate, investors will accept that higher spending to ensure privacy is warranted,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said.  It has been nearly two years since Facebook shares rose 7 percent or more during a trading day. They rose 7.2 percent on April 28, 2016, the day after another first-quarter earnings report.  Net income attributable to Facebook shareholders rose in the first quarter to $4.99 billion, or $1.69 per share, from $3.06 billion, or $1.04 per share, a year earlier.  Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.35 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Total revenue was $11.97 billion, above the analyst estimate of $11.41 billion.  The company declined to provide some details sought by analysts. It has not shared the revenue generated by Instagram, the photo-sharing app it owns, and it declined to provide details about time spent on Facebook. Facebook also owns the popular smartphone apps Messenger and WhatsApp.  Tighter regulation could make Facebook\u2019s ads less lucrative by reducing the kinds of data it can use to personalize and target ads to users, although Facebook\u2019s size means it could also be well positioned to cope with regulations.  Facebook and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google together dominate the internet ad business worldwide. Facebook is expected to take 18 percent of global digital ad revenue this year, compared with Google's 31 percent, according to research firm eMarketer.  The company said it was increasing the amount of money authorized to repurchase shares by an additional $9 billion. It had initially authorized repurchases up to $6 billion.  Facebook shares closed at $185.09 on March 16, the day that the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke after the bell on a Friday. In the days immediately afterward, the company lost more than $50 billion in market value.  The Cambridge Analytica scandal, which has sparked government investigations globally, was mentioned only once on an hour-long conference call between analysts and Facebook management, when one analyst asked Zuckerberg what he learned from testifying in U.S. congressional hearings.  Zuckerberg said the two days of hearings this month were \u201can important moment for the company to hear the feedback, and to show what we\u2019re doing.\u201d","1491":"MENLO PARK, Calif. (Reuters) - Facebook Inc will ban false information about voting requirements and fact-check fake reports of violence or long lines at polling stations ahead of next month\u2019s U.S. midterm elections, company executives told Reuters, the latest effort to reduce voter manipulation on its service.  The world\u2019s largest online social network, with 1.5 billion daily users, has stopped short of banning all false or misleading posts, something that Facebook has shied away from as it would likely increase its expenses and leave it open to charges of censorship.  The latest move addresses a sensitive area for the company, which has come under fire for its lax approach to fake news reports and disinformation campaigns, which many believe affected the outcome of the 2016 presidential election, won by Donald Trump.  The new policy was disclosed by Facebook\u2019s cybersecurity policy chief, Nathaniel Gleicher, and other company executives.  The ban on false information about voting methods, set to be announced later on Monday, comes six weeks after Senator Ron Wyden asked Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg how Facebook would counter posts aimed at suppressing votes, such as by telling certain users they could vote by text, a hoax that has been used to reduce turnout in the past.  The information on voting methods becomes one of the few areas in which falsehoods are prohibited on Facebook, a policy enforced by what the company calls \u201ccommunity standards\u201d moderators, although application of its standards has been uneven. It will not stop the vast majority of untruthful posts about candidates or other election issues.  \u201cWe don\u2019t believe we should remove things from Facebook that are shared by authentic people if they don\u2019t violate those community standards, even if they are false,\u201d said Tessa Lyons, product manager for Facebook\u2019s News Feed feature that shows users what friends are sharing.  Links to discouraging reports about polling places that may be inflated or misleading will be referred to fact-checkers under the new policy, Facebook said. If then marked as false, the reports will not be removed but will be seen by fewer of the poster\u2019s friends.  Such partial measures leave Facebook more open to manipulation by users seeking to affect the election, critics say. Russia, and potentially other foreign parties, are already making \u201cpervasive\u201d efforts to interfere in upcoming U.S. elections, the leader of Trump\u2019s national security team said in early August.  A woman looks at the Facebook logo on an iPad in this photo illustration taken June 3, 2018. REUTERS\/Regis Duvignau\/Illustration  Just days before that, Facebook said it uncovered a coordinated political influence campaign to mislead its users and sow dissension among voters, removing 32 pages and accounts from Facebook and Instagram. Members of Congress briefed by Facebook said the methodology suggested Russian involvement.  Trump has disputed claims that Russia has attempted to interfere in U.S. elections. Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied it.  WEIGHING BAN ON HACKED MATERIAL  Facebook instituted a global ban on false information about when and where to vote in 2016, but Monday\u2019s move goes further, including posts about exaggerated identification requirements.  Facebook executives are also debating whether to follow Twitter Inc\u2019s recent policy change to ban posts linking to hacked material, Gleicher told Reuters in an interview.  The dissemination of hacked emails from Democratic party officials likely played a role in tipping the 2016 presidential election to Trump, and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats has warned that Russia has recently been attempting to hack and steal information from U.S. candidates and government officials.  A blanket ban on hacked content, however, would limit exposure to other material some believe serves the public interest, such as the so-called Panama Papers, which in 2015 made public the extensive use of offshore tax havens by the world\u2019s wealthy.  Months ago, senior Facebook executives briefly debated banning all political ads, which produce less than 5 percent of the company\u2019s revenue, sources said. The company rejected that because product managers were loath to leave advertising dollars on the table and policy staffers argued that blocking political ads would favor incumbents and wealthy campaigners who can better afford television and print ads.  Instead, the company checks political ad buyers for proof of national residency and keeps a public archive of who has bought what.  Facebook also takes a middle ground on the authenticity of personal accounts. It can use automated activity it finds to disable pages spreading propaganda, as happened last week, but it does not require phone numbers or other proof of individual identity before allowing people to open accounts in the first place.  On the issue of fake news, Facebook has held off on a total ban, instead limiting the spread of articles marked as false by vetted fact-checkers. However, that approach can leave fact-checkers overwhelmed and able to tackle only the most viral hoaxes.  \u201cWithout a clear and transparent policy to curb the deliberate spread of false information that applies across platforms, we will continue to be vulnerable,\u201d said Graham Brookie, head of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab.

Austrian Max Schrems filed complaints against Google, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing they were acting illegally by forcing users to accept intrusive terms of service or lose access.  That take-it-or-leave-it approach, Schrems told Reuters Television, violates people\u2019s right under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to choose freely whether to allow companies to use their data.  \u201cYou have to have a \u2018yes or no\u2019 option,\u201d Schrems said in an interview recorded in Vienna before he filed the complaints in various European jurisdictions.  \u201cA lot of these companies now force you to consent to the new privacy policy, which is totally against the law.\u201d  The GDPR overhauls data protection laws in the European Union that predate the rise of the internet and, most importantly, foresees fines of up to 4 percent of global revenues for companies that break the rules.  That puts potential sanctions in the ballpark of anti-trust fines levied by Brussels that, in Google\u2019s case, have run into billions of dollars.  Andrea Jelinek, who heads both Austria\u2019s Data Protection Authority and a new European Data Protection Board set up under GDPR, appeared to express sympathy with Schrems\u2019 arguments at a news conference in Brussels.  Asked about the merits of Schrems\u2019 complaints, Jelinek said: \u201cIf there is forced consent, there is no consent.\u201d  Slideshow ( 7 images )  SCOURGE OF FACEBOOK  Schrems was a 23-year-old law student when he first took on Facebook and he\u2019s been fighting Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s social network ever since - becoming the poster-boy for data privacy.  He won a landmark European court ruling in 2015 that invalidated a \u2018safe harbour\u2019 agreement allowing firms to transfer personal data from the EU to the United States, where data protection is less strict.  With GDPR in mind, he recently set up a non-profit called None of Your Business noyb.eu (noyb) that plans legal action to blunt the ability of the tech titans to harvest data that they then use to sell targeted advertising.  His laptop perched on the table of a traditional Viennese coffee house, Schrems showed how a pop-up message on Facebook seeks consent to use his data - and how he is blocked when he refuses.  \u201cThe only way is to really accept it, otherwise you cannot use your Facebook any more,\u201d Schrems explained.  \u201cAs you can see, I have my messages there and I cannot read them unless I agree.\u201d  Erin Egan, Facebook\u2019s chief privacy officer, said in a statement that the company has prepared for 18 months to ensure it meets the requirements of GDPR by making its policies clearer and its privacy settings easier to find.  Slideshow ( 7 images )  Facebook, which has more than 2 billion regular users, has also said that advertising allows it to remain free, and that the whole service, including ads, is meant to be personalized based on user data.  \u201c1,000-EURO BRICK\u201d  Schrems said, however, that Instagram, a photo-sharing network popular with younger users, and encrypted messaging service WhatsApp - both owned by Facebook - also use pop-ups to gain consent and bar users who refuse.  The action brought by noyb against Google relates to new smartphones using its Android operating system. Buyers are required to hand over their data or else own \u201ca 1,000-euro brick\u201d that they can\u2019t use, Schrems said.  Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  noyb is filing the four claims with data protection authorities in France, Belgium, Germany and Austria. Ensuing litigation may play out in Ireland, where both Facebook and Google have their European headquarters.  One filing, made against Facebook on behalf of an Austrian woman, asks the country\u2019s data protection authority to investigate and, as appropriate, prohibit data processing operations based on invalid consent.  It also asks the regulator to impose \u201ceffective, proportionate and dissuasive\u201d fines as foreseen by GDPR, which in Facebook\u2019s case could run to 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion).  \u201cSo far it was cheaper just to ignore privacy rights,\u201d said Schrems. \u201cNow, hopefully, it\u2019s going to be cheaper to follow them because the penalties are so high.\u201d","1494":"FILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is displayed on a smartphone in this illustration taken January 6, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday revived nationwide litigation accusing Facebook Inc FB.O of violating users' privacy rights by tracking their internet activity even after they logged out of the social media website.  The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said Facebook users could pursue several claims under federal and California privacy and wiretapping laws.  A spokeswoman for Facebook said the proposed class action was without merit, and the Menlo Park, California-based company will continue defending itself.  Facebook users had accused the company of quietly storing cookies on their browsers that tracked when they visited outside websites containing \u201clike\u201d buttons, and then selling personal profiles based on their browsing histories to advertisers.  U.S. District Judge Edward Davila in San Jose, California had dismissed the lawsuit in 2017, including claims under the federal Wiretap Act, and said the users lacked legal standing to pursue economic damages claims.  But in Thursday\u2019s decision, Chief Judge Sidney Thomas wrote for a three-judge panel that users had a reasonable expectation of privacy, and had sufficiently alleged a \u201cclear invasion\u201d of their right to privacy.  The panel also said California law recognized a right to recoup unjustly earned profits, regardless of whether a defendant\u2019s conduct directly caused economic harm.  \u201cFacebook\u2019s user profiles would allegedly reveal an individual\u2019s likes, dislikes, interests, and habits over a significant amount of time, without affording users meaningful opportunity to control or prevent the unauthorized exploration of their private lives,\u201d Thomas wrote.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo  As part of the settlement, Facebook will agree to create a board committee on privacy and will agree to new executive certifications that users\u2019 privacy is being properly protected, the people said.  Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg will have to certify every three months that the company is properly safeguarding user privacy, a person briefed on the matter said.  The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that the FTC will allege Facebook misled users about its handling of their phone numbers and its use of two-factor authentication as part of a wide-ranging complaint that accompanies a settlement ending the government\u2019s privacy probe, citing two people familiar with the matter.  Separately, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to announce a related settlement with Facebook for around $100 million over allegations it failed to disclose risks to investors over its privacy practices. The Wall Street Journal reported the SEC settlement earlier.  The Post also reported the FTC also plans to allege Facebook provided insufficient information to about 30 million users about a facial recognition tool, an issue identified earlier by Consumer Reports.  The settlement comes amid growing concern among U.S. policymakers about the privacy of online users and have sparked calls for new legal protections in Congress. Separately, the U.S. Justice Department said late Tuesday it is launching a broad antitrust probe into the competitive practices of large tech companies like Facebook.  Two people briefed on the matter confirmed the Post report the FTC will not require Facebook to admit guilt as part of the settlement. The settlement will need to be approved by a federal judge and will contain other significant allegations of privacy lapses, the people said.  The fine will mark the largest civil penalty ever paid to the FTC.  The FTC and Facebook declined to comment.  The FTC confirmed in March 2018 it had opened an investigation into allegations Facebook inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The probe has focused on whether the data sharing violated a 2011 consent agreement between Facebook and the regulator and then widened to include other privacy allegations.  A person briefed on the matter said the phone number, facial recognition and two-factor authentication issues were not part of the initial Cambridge Analytica probe.  Some in Congress have criticized the reported $5 billion penalty, noting Facebook in 2018 had $55.8 billion in revenue and $22.1 billion in net income. Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, said last week the fine should be $50 billion.  While the deal resolves a major regulatory headache for Facebook, the Silicon Valley firm still faces further potential antitrust probes as the FTC and Justice Department undertake a wide-ranging review of competition among the biggest U.S. tech companies. Facebook is also facing public criticism from President Donald Trump and others about its planned cryptocurrency Libra over concerns about privacy and money laundering.  The Cambridge Analytica missteps, as well as anger over hate speech and misinformation on its platform, have prompted calls from people ranging from presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren to a Facebook co-founder, Chris Hughes, for the government to force the social media giant to sell Instagram, which it bought in 2012, and WhatsApp, purchased in 2014.

In a statement, Australia\u2019s privacy commissioner, Angelene Falk, said her office would \u201cconfer with regulatory authorities internationally\u201d, given the global nature of the matter.  A Facebook spokeswoman in Australia said the company would be \u201cfully responsive\u201d to the investigation and had recently updated some privacy settings.  Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, told reporters during a conference call that he accepted blame for the data leak.  Zuckerberg is due to testify about the matter next week during two U.S. congressional hearings, and the data breach has drawn criticism from lawmakers and regulators around the world.  London-based Cambridge Analytica, which has counted U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign among its clients, disputed Facebook\u2019s estimate of affected users.  It said in a tweet on Wednesday that it received no more than 30 million records from a researcher it hired to collect data about people on Facebook.  Australia\u2019s investigation follows comments by New Zealand\u2019s privacy commissioner last week that Facebook had broken laws in that country, a charge the company called disappointing.  Australia's competition regulator is already investigating whether Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google GOOGL.O had disrupted the news media to the detriment of publishers and consumers.","1508":"LONDON (Reuters) - Facebook intentionally breached data privacy and competition law and should, along with other big tech companies, be subject to a new regulator to protect democracy and citizens\u2019 rights, British lawmakers said on Monday.  In a damning report that singled out Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for what it said was a failure of leadership and personal responsibility, the British parliament\u2019s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee said tech firms had proved ineffective in stopping harmful content on their platforms.  This included disinformation, attempts by foreign countries to influence elections, and risks to personal data.  \u201cWe need a radical shift in the balance of power between the platforms and the people,\u201d committee chairman Damian Collins said.  Collins said the age of inadequate self-regulation must end, following an 18-month investigation that concluded Facebook had \u201cintentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws.\u201d  \u201cThe rights of the citizen need to be established in statute, by requiring the tech companies to adhere to a code of conduct written into law by Parliament, and overseen by an independent regulator,\u201d he said.  Facebook rejected the suggestion it had breached data protection and competition laws, and said it shared the committee\u2019s concerns about false news and election integrity.  \u201cWe are open to meaningful regulation and support the committee\u2019s recommendation for electoral law reform,\u201d Facebook\u2019s UK public policy manager Karim Palant said.  \u201cWe also support effective privacy legislation that holds companies to high standards in their use of data and transparency for users.\u201d  Lawmakers in Europe and the United States are scrambling to get to grips with the risks posed by big tech companies regulating the platforms used by billions of people.  Germany has been at the forefront of the backlash against Facebook, fueled by last year\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal in which tens of millions of Facebook profiles were harvested without their users\u2019 consent. Earlier this month, it ordered Facebook to curb its data collection practices in the country.  U.S senator Marco Rubio introduced a bill last month aimed at giving Americans more control over data collected by online companies like Facebook and Alphabet\u2019s Google.  The British committee does not propose legislation, but does have the power to summon witnesses for its investigations.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo  ZUCKERBERG NO SHOW  Facebook became the focus of its inquiry after whistleblower Christopher Wylie alleged that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica had obtained the data of millions of users of the social network.  Zuckerberg apologized last year for a \u201cbreach of trust\u201d over the scandal.  But he refused to appear three times before British lawmakers, a stance that showed \u201ccontempt\u201d toward parliament and the members of nine legislatures from around the world, the committee said.  \u201cWe believe that in its evidence to the committee Facebook has often deliberately sought to frustrate our work, by giving incomplete, disingenuous and at times misleading answers to our questions,\u201d Collins said.  \u201cMark Zuckerberg continually fails to show the levels of leadership and personal responsibility that should be expected from someone who sits at the top of one of the world\u2019s biggest companies.\u201d  Facebook, however, said it had cooperated with the investigation by answering more than 700 questions and putting forward four senior executives to give evidence.  It said it had made substantial changes, including the authorization of every political advert, and it was investing heavily in identifying abusive content.  \u201cWhile we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago,\u201d Palant said.  The committee said it had identified major threats to society from the dominance of companies such as Facebook - which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram - Google and Twitter.  Democracy was at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalized adverts from unidentifiable sources, they said, and social media platforms were failing to act against harmful content and respect the privacy of users.  Companies like Facebook were also using their size to bully smaller firms that relied on social media platforms to reach customers, it added.","1509":"A 3D-printed Facebook logo are seen in front of displayed binary digits in this illustration taken, March 18, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Facebook shareholders risk focusing on the wrong problem. They punished Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s $636 billion company in after-hours trading on Wednesday, sending the stock down as much as 7% on the back of fourth-quarter earnings that showed rising costs and slowing sales. A bigger issue, though, is the decision by Zuckerberg\u2019s company to lump together the metrics for its various social-media platforms.  That\u2019s not to downplay results. Revenue grew 25%, one of the pokiest growth rates in years. Worse, costs rose even faster, by 34%. But Facebook beat analysts\u2019 estimates for the top and bottom line, as well as for user growth, even if not by much. Moreover, executives had already flagged both issues. Expenses, for example, have been ballooning as it tries to police a flood of toxic and divisive content.  Dealing with those issues isn\u2019t going away any time soon. On Tuesday Facebook unveiled a confusing set of proposals and bylaws for its oversight board. Advertising growth this year is expected to slow further, and finance chief David Wehner didn\u2019t mince words about the onslaught of global regulators and the impact of privacy standards on ad targeting. \u201cThe majority of the impact lies in front of us,\u201d he told investors.  That ought to be a reason to provide investors with more clarity about the business. Instead Zuckerberg is busy knitting Instagram and WhatsApp into a tighter framework with his flagship product. The company is reporting daily active users for a new metric that counts the number of people using one or more of the products. That was 2.3 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, an increase of 11% from the fourth quarter of 2018. It\u2019s not clear how this so-called \u201cfamily\u201d tally gels with the 1.6 billion or so daily active users on the Facebook platform, which was up 9%.  The move prevents investors from getting a decent sense of how each franchise is performing, and its value. Instagram would be an enormous public company on its own \u2013 $80 billion, Breakingviews calculated two years ago. That number has surely mushroomed. WhatsApp is a popular messaging service that also deserves its own space on the income statement. Shoving it all into a black box does shareholders a disservice.","1510":"YAOUNDE (Reuters) - A video link posted on Facebook on June 20 showed a man cooking human body parts in a pot over a wood fire.  Simon Munzu, a former UN official, who is campaigning for peace in the Anglophone regions of Cameroon, shows a threat message posted against him on social media by separatists during an interview with Reuters in Yaounde, Cameroon October 3, 2018. Picture taken October 3, 2018. REUTERS\/Zohra Bensemra  In Cameroon, the footage went viral. Some Facebook users said the man was a cannibal and that the video was shot in the country\u2019s English-speaking west, where separatist insurgents are fighting to create a breakaway state.  Local websites quickly debunked this notion. The man in the video was not a separatist fighter or cannibal, and the body parts were not real. The clip was taken on a Nigerian film set and uploaded to Instagram on June 17 by make-up artist Hakeem Onilogbo, who uses the platform to showcase his work.  But the video\u2019s rapid spread raises questions about Facebook\u2019s ability to police millions of posts each day and crack down on hate speech in a country where internet use is rising fast, social media are used for political ends and the company has no permanent physical presence.  The day the link was posted on Facebook, a member of the government brought the video to the attention of international diplomats in the capital, Yaounde, via the WhatsApp messaging service, according to messages seen by Reuters.  Five days later, Cameroon\u2019s minister for territorial administration cited it as justification for an army clampdown against the secessionists that was already under way in the Anglophone regions.  The minister, Paul Atanga Nji, compared the rebellion - over decades of perceived marginalization by the French-speaking majority - to an Islamist insurgency waged by the Nigeria-based militant group Boko Haram which has killed 30,000 people.  \u201cBoko Haram committed atrocities, but they did not cut up humans and cook them in pots,\u201d the minister said in comments broadcast on state television and widely reported in Cameroon.  Nji did not respond to requests for comment. Government spokesman Issa Tchiroma Bakary said that in future the government would work to verify information before commenting.  Facebook said the video had not been reported by users and that it could not comment further on the clip. It was no longer available on the site by late October.  A senior Facebook official said tackling misinformation in Cameroon was a priority for the company, which acknowledges more needs to be done.  \u201cWe\u2019re prioritizing countries where we\u2019ve already seen how quickly online rumors can fuel violence, such as Myanmar and Cameroon,\u201d said Ebele Okobi, Director of Africa Public Policy at Facebook.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  UNDER FIRE  Facebook is under fire for carrying misleading information, including in the United States and Britain, and over posts against the Muslim Rohingya minority in Myanmar which have had deadly consequences.  Sri Lankan authorities briefly banned Facebook this year because the government said it was fueling violence between Buddhists and Muslims. In India, messages on Facebook-owned WhatsApp have been linked to attacks on religious minorities.  In Cameroon, Facebook has been used both to incite violence and to make threatening posts.  Simon Munzu, a former United Nations representative, said he was the target of death threats on Facebook after it was announced in July that he would help organize negotiations in the separatist conflict. Afraid, Munzu went to stay with friends.  Facebook removed the posts in October, after it was made aware of them by Reuters, saying they violated company standards.  Esther Omam, who runs a non-governmental organization (NGO) called Reach Out, hid at a church and then fled to the Francophone region after receiving death threats from separatists following a peace march which she led, she told Reuters.  \u201cThe crisis has destroyed my life and my family,\u201d she said. \u201cI cannot work anymore. My family is divided. My husband is elsewhere, my children are elsewhere.\u201d  Facebook has no staff operating permanently in Cameroon and says it monitors the country from Britain and the United States. It has an Africa-focused team that frequently visits the region, and has partnered with NGOs and civil society in Cameroon in recent months to combat hate speech.  This included paying several thousand dollars to civil society to help organize training sessions for journalists to spot falsehoods online, representatives from two groups involved told Reuters. Some groups also flag offensive posts to Facebook.  Facebook has removed pages and accounts related to the separatist conflict, and is working to slow the spread of kidnapping videos, the company said.  It declined to say how many people it had helping it in Cameroon, how much money it had so far invested or how many posts it had taken down.  Reuters found dozens of pages posted in recent months showing graphic images in Cameroon, some of which were months old.  One Facebook user on July 18 posted a picture of the decapitated body of a Cameroonian policeman lying in a gutter, and said the image gave him joy.  The same day, separatist spokesman Ivo Tapang applauded the killing of two Cameroonian soldiers and linked to a website raising funds for guns, ammunition and grenade launchers. Tapang did not respond to requests for comment.  A Facebook spokeswoman said the company was unaware of the posts before Reuters pointed them out but that they were both removed after review. It is against Facebook rules to celebrate suffering or crowdfund for arms, she said.  Facebook has artificial intelligence that it uses globally to detect problematic posts. But in Cameroon, it does not have a consortium of fact-checking companies to monitor posts -- as it does in the United States.  Leading civil society figures in Cameroon say Facebook needs more resources and faces an increasingly difficult task as internet use grows.  \u201cIt is not possible to stop misinformation on Facebook,\u201d said Maximilienne Ngo Mbe, executive director of REDHAC, a civil society group that has organized training sessions and flags indecent posts to Facebook.  NO EASY FIX  The number of people with internet access in Cameroon rose from 0.86 million in 2010 to 5.9 million in 2016, about a quarter of the population, according to the International Telecommunications Union, a U.N. agency.  The government shut down the internet in English-speaking regions for three months last year because of the unrest.  After service resumed in April 2017, Facebook was the main outlet for people speaking out against the army crackdown, in which soldiers razed villages and shot dead unarmed civilians.  But misleading and hateful posts have persisted, groups that monitor posts say, echoing issues Facebook sees worldwide.  Facebook is not the only service facing a battle to tackle misinformation and hate speech. Offensive videos and images are posted on Twitter or transmitted by WhatsApp.  WhatsApp cannot view private, encrypted conversations, a WhatsApp spokeswoman said, so detecting hate speech there is harder. A Twitter spokeswoman said it prohibits the promotion of violence and encourages users to flag those posts.","1511":"March 23 (Reuters) - Wall Street\u2019s main indexes opened higher on Friday, helped by gains in Nike and Facebook , after steep losses a day earlier on fears of a global trade war after the United States slapped tariffs on Chinese imports.

Earlier on Tuesday, a senior U.S. Treasury official, speaking to reporters in Switzerland, said that Libra must meet the highest standards for combating money laundering and terrorism financing if it is to get off the ground.  The Libra project has renewed focus on how cryptocurrencies are regulated, with current rules on the sector patchy and varying from country to country.  In the first global attempt to bring the crypto sector to heel, the FATF - a body set up 30 years ago to tackle money laundering - told countries in June to tighten oversight of cryptocurrency exchanges to stop digital coins being used to launder cash and finance terrorism.  Liu, speaking at an event in London, said the illegal use of cryptocurrencies is probably spreading at pace. Known examples, from money laundering to drug trafficking, probably represent only a fraction of the true scale of criminal use, he said.  \u201cThe anonymity afforded by virtual assets is being exploited by serious criminals,\u201d Liu said. \u201cThese activities are likely to be growing quickly, as law enforcement agencies are only seeing the tip of the iceberg.\u201d  Liu, who took charge of FATF in July, said the volume and speed of cryptocurrency transactions presents a growing challenge in pinpointing illegal use, even as technology to identify such actions is developed.  \u201cWe have talked about finding suspicious activity as being like finding a needle in a haystack,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, that haystack is getting bigger and bigger, and is moving all the time.\u201d","1513":"FILE PHOTO: Silhouettes of mobile users are seen next to a screen projection of Facebook logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018.

The letter noted that Facebook later submitted written responses to Congress that it does in fact access users\u2019 audio when they have opted in and used a specific Facebook service.  However, Peters pointed out that the company did not, in follow-up responses, \u201carticulate what you do with the audio accessed under those circumstances, the extent of Facebook\u2019s use of this practice or the reasons for the discrepancy in your testimony on this issue during the hearing.\u201d  Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission, Facebook\u2019s lead regulator in the European Union, said on Wednesday it sought information on how the company handled data during the manual transcription of users\u2019 audio recordings.

Under the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation privacy rules, regulators can fine violators up to 4% of a company\u2019s global revenue or 20 million euros ($22 million), whichever is higher.  Facebook until recently carried out human reviews of private audio from its Messenger app to improve transcriptions by artificial intelligence systems, but no EU users were affected, the company said this week.

The settlement is awaiting court approval.","1516":"(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission approved a roughly $5 billion settlement with Facebook Inc this week over its investigation into the social media company\u2019s handling of user data, a source familiar with the situation said on Friday.  The FTC has been investigating allegations Facebook inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The probe has focused on whether the data sharing violated a 2011 consent agreement between Facebook and the regulator.  Investors cheered news of the deal and pushed Facebook shares up 1.8%, while several powerful Democratic lawmakers in Washington condemned the proposed penalty as inadequate.  The FTC is expected to include in the settlement other restrictions on how Facebook treats user privacy, according to the Wall Street Journal, which also said that the agency vote was along party lines, with three Republicans voting to approve it and two Democrats opposed.  The settlement would be the largest civil penalty ever paid to the agency.  The FTC and Facebook declined to comment.  Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat and chair of a congressional antitrust panel, called the $5 billion penalty \u201ca Christmas present five months early.\u201d  Small toy figures are seen in front of Facebook logo in this illustration picture, April 8, 2019.

It won\u2019t make them think twice about their responsibility to protect user data,\u201d he said.  Facebook\u2019s revenue for the first quarter of this year was $15.1 billion while its net income was $2.43 billion. It would have been higher, but Facebook set aside $3 billion for the FTC penalty.  While the deal resolves a major regulatory headache for Facebook, the Silicon Valley firm still faces further potential antitrust probes as the FTC and Justice Department undertake a wide-ranging review of competition among the biggest U.S. tech companies.  It is also facing public criticism from President Donald Trump and others about its planned cryptocurrency Libra over concerns about privacy and money laundering.  The Cambridge Analytica missteps, as well as anger over hate speech and misinformation on its platform, have also prompted calls from people ranging from presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren to a Facebook co-founder, Chris Hughes, for the government to force the social media giant to sell Instagram, which it bought in 2012, and WhatsApp, purchased in 2014.  But the company\u2019s core business has proven resilient, as Facebook blew past earnings estimates in the past two quarters.  While details of the agreement are unknown, in a letter to the FTC earlier this year, Senators Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, and Josh Hawley, a Republican, told the agency that even a $5 billion civil penalty was too little and that top officials, potentially including founder Mark Zuckerberg, should be held personally responsible.  FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra, a Democrat, has said the agency should hold executives responsible for violations of consent decrees if they participated in the violations. Chopra did not respond to requests for comment on Friday.  The settlement still needs to be finalized by the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division and a final announcement could come as early as next week, the source said.

Facebook said it had banned 20 individuals and organizations to prevent the spread of \u201chate and misinformation\u201d after reviewing the content.  Clare Wareing, a spokeswoman for the Menlo Park, California-based company, told Reuters by email that it was the first time the company had banned members of a military or state actors.  Military spokesman Colonel Zaw Min Tun declined to comment on Facebook\u2019s action. Government spokesman Zaw Htay did not answer calls seeking comment.  The ban included two pages dedicated to the army\u2019s commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, that have been the military\u2019s primary outlet for information, especially around the crisis in the western state of Rakhine last year.  More than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled the state for Bangladesh after a security crackdown launched in response to attacks by Rohingya militants.  Min Aung Hlaing\u2019s pages - one of which was \u201cliked\u201d by 1.3 million people - gave detailed running commentaries of what it said were battles with the militants.  Other posts showed the bespectacled commander in civilian clothing giving alms to monks, or viewing potential weapon purchases abroad. The accounts showed military doctors treating the sick and soldiers performing public works in rural areas.  The military also operates its own newspaper and television station, but Facebook has allowed it to communicate in real time, even as operations unfolded on the ground. Facebook said the accounts it banned on Monday had 12 million followers.  \u201cFacebook has been the key channel enabling the military\u2019s communication with the public and this ban will hit their communication ability hard,\u201d said Richard Horsey, a Yangon-based independent political analyst and former U.N. diplomat to the country.  Horsey said Min Aung Hlaing was a politically-savvy operator whom some analysts and diplomats have tipped as a potential candidate at the next election in 2020, when Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy is likely to face opposition from nationalists aligned with the military.  \u201cHe has built a significant political profile for himself extending well beyond his narrow military role and has used Facebook to project it onto the public,\u201d said Horsey.  Reuters was unable to contact Min Aung Hlaing on Monday.  The social media giant has been accused of acting too slowly to remove content that has fueled violence, especially in the western Rakhine state that is home to the stateless Rohingya Muslim minority.  Facebook said on Monday it was making progress on preventing \u201cthe spread of hate and misinformation\u201d in Myanmar, admitting it had been \u201ctoo slow to act\u201d.

Suggesting that NBC\u2019s reports linking the wildfires to climate change ( here , here ) are false, the posts contradict scientists who say climate change has made the wildfires worse.  Record temperatures have worsened California\u2019s ongoing drought and triggered dry lightning that started more than 700 fires, some in redwood rainforests and Joshua trees that do not normally burn. Michael Gerrard, director of Columbia Law School\u2019s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, referred to the onslaught of lightning strikes, due to what he believes is human impact on climate, as \u201cMother Nature injected with steroids.\u201d ( here ).  While President Donald Trump blames poor forest management - mainly a failure to cull overgrown forests - for the increasing number and intensity of fires, the governors of California and Oregon - the states worst hit this season - say climate change is largely responsible.  Scientists, however, say that both factors are at work. As explained here , the U.S. West\u2019s increasingly dry and overgrown forests have become large-scale tinderboxes over decades while wildfires have become more frequent, more intense, and more deadly. Meanwhile, climate change is amplifying historical weather patterns. Hotter temperatures in turn sap the air of humidity and dry out forest and brush on land, creating perfect conditions for wildfires ( here ).  The Reuters Fact Check team previously debunked misleading Facebook posts suggesting that wildfires are not exacerbated by climate change ( here and here ).  VERDICT  Partly false. NBC has reported on the effects of climate change on the wildfires in the U.S. West, but it has also reported on cases of arson that either caused, contributed to, or coincided with the wildfires. Experts say warmer temperatures caused by climate change have exacerbated the conditions that allow wildfires to blaze and spread.  This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.

FILE PHOTO: A 3D printed Facebook logo is seen in front of a displayed Russian flag in this photo illustration taken on August 3, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  The Federal Agency of News LLC, known as FAN, and its sole shareholder, Evgeniy Zubarev, filed the lawsuit in federal court in the Northern District of California, seeking damages and an injunction to prevent Facebook from blocking its account.  Facebook deleted FAN\u2019s account in April as it purged pages linked to the St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency, which was indicted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller earlier this year for flooding social media with false information in a bid to sow discord in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. election.  Facebook did not respond to a request for comment. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment.  FAN and Zubarev said they were improperly swept up in Facebook\u2019s purge, which took down more than 270 Russian language accounts and pages, according to the complaint.  \u201cFAN is an independent, authentic and legitimate news agency which publishes reports that are relevant and of interest to the general public,\u201d the company said in the lawsuit.  The lawsuit argued that Facebook had effectively acted as an arm of the government in improperly impinging on its right to free speech, and cited the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in claiming Facebook discriminated against it due to its Russian origins.  Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor, described those arguments as weak and predicted the plaintiffs would have a hard time gaining any traction in the courts.  \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say this lawsuit is not going to be very successful,\u201d he said. \u201cAt first glance it seems like a PR stunt to me.\u201d  FAN acknowledged previously sharing the same office building as the Internet Research Agency and said it has employed Elena Alekseevna Khusyaynova, the Russian woman charged by prosecutors last month for attempting to meddle in the 2018 congressional elections, as its chief accountant since August 2016.  But the plaintiffs said Khusyaynova\u2019s role at the company has been limited to overseeing day-to-day bookkeeping, and that she was not an officer and had no discretion over editorial content.  The plaintiffs also said they were not involved in \u201cProject Lakhta,\u201d, a Kremlin-backed information warfare campaign U.S. prosecutors say was started in 2014 and financed by Evgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin, an oligarch close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Prigozhin, known as \u201cPutin\u2019s chef\u201d due to his catering company and its ties to the Kremlin, was indicted in February along with the Internet Research Agency, which he controls.  Khusyaynova was the chief accountant for Project Lakhta, according to the charging documents in her case, which is being prosecuted by assistant U.S. attorneys in the Justice Department\u2019s Eastern District of Virginia.  A spokesman for the district did not respond to a request for comment.  Mueller is not handling Khusyaynova\u2019s case because his focus is on the 2016 presidential election and the charges against her relate to the 2018 midterm elections.","1522":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window)  * Facebook on track for its best day since Jan 2016  * DowDuPont top decliner on Dow as revenue misses  * S&P set for best monthly performance since Oct 2015  * Details awaited on U.S.-China trade talks  * Dow off 0.24 pct, S&P up 0.69 pct, Nasdaq jumps 1.33 pct (Updates to early afternoon)  Jan 31 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq extended a rally on Thursday, as strong earnings from Facebook Inc added to optimism following the Federal Reserve\u2019s dovish remarks, while investors waited for the outcome of the U.S.-China trade talks.  Facebook jumped 12.2 percent, on track to post its best day since January 2016, after its quarterly profit topped analysts\u2019 estimates, showing that advertisers were still flocking to spend money on the service even after a series of high profile embarrassments.  General Electric Co soared 14.7 percent after the industrial conglomerate beat estimates for quarterly sales and cash flow and said it expects industrial revenue to rise by low to mid single-digit percent in 2019.  Stocks took heart from the Fed\u2019s pledge on Thursday that it would be patient in raising interest rates further this year, easing investor concerns about tightening financial conditions crimping economic growth.  \u201cThere were positive earnings from key companies but mostly it\u2019s a follow through from yesterday\u2019s rally,\u201d said Scot Lance, managing director at Titus Wealth Management in Larkspur, California.  With fourth-quarter earnings largely exceeding market expectations and the Fed striking a more flexible tone, the S&P 500 is on track to post its best monthly performance since October 2015.  Of the 210 S&P 500 companies that have reported fourth-quarter results, 71 percent have topped profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data.  Investors are awaiting the conclusion of the high-level talks between the United States and China, aimed at easing a six-month-old trade war that has battered financial markets.  U.S. President Donald Trump expressed optimism about the trade talks, but said no final deal would be made until he meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the near future.  \u201cThere is a lot of wishful thinking about the trade negotiations yielding to a long-tem beneficial plan for both parties. Because despite positive earnings and a strong global economy, the trade issue still remains an overhang,\u201d said Lance.  At 12:57 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 58.98 points, or 0.24 percent, at 24,955.88, the S&P 500 was up 18.56 points, or 0.69 percent, at 2,699.61 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 95.79 points, or 1.33 percent, at 7,278.87.  The S&P communications services sector gained 3.68 percent, leading gains among the 11 major S&P sectors.  Charter Communications Inc jumped 14.6 percent after topping quarterly revenue estimates, as the cable operator attracted more customers for its internet services.  The Dow was dragged down by losses in DowDuPont Inc , which fell 8.5 percent after the chemical maker\u2019s revenue fell short of expectations. The S&P materials sector dropped 1.4 percent.  Microsoft Corp declined 1.4 percent as its Azure cloud computing sales grew at a slower pace than a year earlier, although its quarterly results and forecast topped Wall Street estimates.  Intel Corp slipped 2.2 percent after the chipmaker named interim Chief Executive Officer Robert Swan to the role on a permanent basis.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 2.47-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.73-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.  The S&P index recorded 23 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 38 new highs and 18 new lows.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  At stake are standard contractual clauses used by Facebook and hundreds of thousands of companies, ranging from banks to industrial giants to carmakers, to transfer personal data to the United States and other parts of the world.  Another issue is whether the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which came into existence in 2016 and designed to protect Europeans\u2019 personal data transferred across the Atlantic for commercial use, is lawful or not.  Schrems, an Austrian law student, who successfully fought against the EU\u2019s previous privacy rules called Safe Harbour in 2015, challenged Facebook\u2019s use of standard clauses on the grounds that they do not offer sufficient data protection safeguards.  Facebook\u2019s lead regulator, the Irish Data Protection agency, took the case to the Irish High Court which then sought guidance from the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).  The opinion by Henrik Saugmandsgaard \u00d8e, advocate general at the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union, is non-binding. However, judges follow such recommendations in four out of five cases. The court will rule in the coming months.

The military was not immediately available for comment.  Half of Myanmar\u2019s 53 million people use Facebook, which for many is synonymous with the internet.  On Tuesday, the military warned against the posting of what it said were rumors on social media that could incite rioting and cause instability, the information ministry said, a day after the army seized power in a coup.  More than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims fled Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine state in August 2017 after a military crackdown that refugees said included mass killings and rape. Rights groups documented killings of civilians and burning of villages. Myanmar authorities said they were battling an insurgency and denied carrying out systematic atrocities.

Myanmar\u2019s army on Monday handed power to military chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing and detained elected leader and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, saying it had responded to what it called election fraud.  Facebook said it banned 20 Myanmar military individuals and organizations in 2018, including the Myawaddy television network and Min Aung Hlaing. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the takedown of a page linked to the TV network, said the action was taken after the Journal asked Facebook about the page.  A Facebook spokeswoman said it was also removing misinformation that could risk imminent violence or physical harm or that delegitimized the outcome of the November 2020 General Election, including claims of electoral fraud.  \u201cWe are closely monitoring political events in Myanmar as they unfold and are taking additional steps to stop misinformation and content that could incite further tensions at this time,\u201d said Rafael Frankel, Facebook\u2019s director of public policy for Southeast Asia, in a statement.

Concerns about the social media giant\u2019s declining profit margins and battered reputation have prompted 93 U.S. mutual funds to completely sell out of their positions in the company so far this year, exacerbating a roughly 35 percent decline in Facebook\u2019s share price from its highs, according to Refinitiv\u2019s Lipper research service.  The selling by fund firms including Fidelity Investments, The Hartford and Putnam Investments combined for a total of nearly 12 million shares, and came amid similar moves to liquidate positions in the company by prominent growth-focused hedge funds. Jana Partners and Third Point LLC, for instance, together sold nearly 3.7 million Facebook shares in the third quarter, according to securities filings.  Funds that have dumped Facebook, whose shares helped lead the broad U.S. market higher the last two years, are now favoring investments ranging from payments companies like Visa Inc V.N and Worldpay Inc WP.N to consumer companies including PepsiCo Inc PEP.O and Chef's Warehouse Inc CHEF.O because they expect the troubles at the social media company to continue as it leaves its era of rapid growth behind.  Facebook was rocked by disclosures earlier this year that the personal information of up to 87 million users may have been improperly shares with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.  \"The revelations in the first quarter of 2018 about data privacy issues and the growing global concerns about data security and the potential for increased regulation made it challenging to handicap the required investments to remedy some of these issues, which we anticipated would weigh meaningfully on earnings growth in coming quarters,\" said Jim Hamel, portfolio manager of the Artisan Global Opportunities Fund ARTRX.O.  Hamel\u2019s fund, which liquidated its position in May, reaped a nearly 400 percent gain on Facebook after buying during its initial public offering in May 2012, which was priced at $38 a share. Hamel said he has used the gains to add to positions in the fast-growing global digital payments industry such as Worldpay, whose shares are up 12 percent for the year to date.  Greg Woodard, managing director at Manning & Napier, said his firm, which began buying Facebook in November 2012 at around $20 per share, sold all its Facebook shares this year as part of a broad move away from cyclical technology companies.  Facebook\u2019s \u201cmost recent guidance really substantiated the margin contraction that we had started to worry about, and when we looked at the price and our future growth expectations they didn\u2019t match up with what the market was forecasting,\u201d he said.  Woodard said his firm has added positions in software developer EPam Systems Inc EPAM.N and global beverage company PepsiCo, and has been adding to its position in Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O on dips.  \u201cBROKEN\u201d STOCK?  While Facebook is now trading at a more compelling valuation following the steep declines in its share price, questions about its ability to maintain and accelerate its growth rate may leave Facebook in a no-man\u2019s land between a growth stock that appeals to investors focused on rapid expansion and a value stock that appeals to investors looking for companies that trade at a discount or offer attractive dividends.  \u201cOnce a company gets put into the penalty box by a growth investor it\u2019s hard to get out,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at independent research firm CFRA. \u201cWhen a stock is perceived as a broken growth stock it loses its appeal, whereas a declining stock price for a value stock can often make it more appealing.\u201d  Woodard, the Manning & Napier fund manager, said his firm would not purchase shares of Facebook again in its growth strategies, and instead would put the company into a fund that focuses on \u201ccompanies that need to fix themselves\u201d if he were to buy it again.  For that to happen, Facebook\u2019s stock price would need to be \u201csignificantly lower,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gap is not worth putting a number on it.\u201d","1537":"FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed Facebook Libra cryptocurrency logo is seen in front of displayed German flag in this illustration taken, September 13, 2019.

Facebook also removed 980 groups that it said encouraged rioting, a majority seen as generally right-wing militias but a substantial number identified as part of the leftist antifa movement. (bit.ly\/325oQEN)  The long-anticipated takedowns come amid sustained criticism as QAnon activity has surged on Facebook this year. Twitter previously removed thousands of QAnon accounts.  QAnon began in the aftermath of the false \u201cpizzagate\u201d conspiracy that claimed, ahead of the 2016 presidential election, that prominent Democrats were running a pedophile ring out of the basement of a Washington restaurant.  It centers on anonymous postings from someone using the nickname Q who claims to be a high official in the administration of President Donald Trump. Q and his most-followed supporters idolize Trump and have asserted that Democratic and Hollywood elites worship the devil, eat children, and in some cases have already been executed after secret military tribunals and replaced by actors.  A vocal QAnon supporter last week won the Republican congressional primary in a conservative Georgia district, drawing praise from Trump, who has declined to disavow the movement.  Asked Wednesday about the QAnon belief that he was saving the world from satanic cannibals, Trump said: \u201cIs that supposed to be a bad thing? ... We are saving the world, from a radical left philosophy.\u201d  The FBI identifies QAnon as a potential source of domestic violence, and some of its followers have been charged with murder and kidnapping.  Facebook has long considered some organizations to be inherently dangerous and banned them, and some critics had urged the company to do the same with QAnon.  \u201cTaking down groups and pages, restricting others, and banning hashtags is a step, but an insufficient one,\u201d said Cindy Otis, a former CIA analyst with a new book on misinformation.

FILE PHOTO: Facebook logos are seen on a screen in this picture illustration taken December 2, 2019. REUTERS\/Johanna Geron\/Illustration\/File Photo  The case is based on a challenge by Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems, who argued that Facebook\u2019s contracts do not protect data to European levels, especially given concerns about activities by U.S. spy agencies.  Schrems had also called on Ireland, where Facebook has its European headquarters, to act against the company because it is subjected to U.S. surveillance laws, which he believes could threaten Europeans\u2019 rights.  Schrems successfully fought against the EU\u2019s previous \u2018Safe Harbour\u2019 privacy rules in 2015.  Henrik Saugmandsgaard \u00d8e, advocate general (AG) at the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), said the agreements used by many companies including Facebook to underpin activities such as outsourced services, cloud infrastructure, data hosting and finance are legal.  The court, which follows such recommendations in four out of five cases, will rule in the coming months.  However, he added privacy regulators must prohibit such data transfer when laws of the countries receiving the data, such as the United States, conflict with the data protection requirements of the agreements, known as standard contractual clauses.  Schrems said he was \u201cgenerally happy\u201d with the legal opinion.  \u201cEveryone will still be able to have all necessary data flows with the U.S., like sending emails or booking a hotel in the U.S.,\u201d he said.  \u201cSome EU businesses may not be able to use certain U.S. providers for outsourcing anymore, because US surveillance laws requires these companies to disclose data to the National Security Agency (NSA).\u201d  \u201cIt is really upon the United States to ensure baseline privacy protections for foreigners. Otherwise no one will trust U.S. companies with their data.\u201d  The opinion calls into question the sufficiency of U.S. data protections, said Caitlin Fennessy, research director at the International Association of Privacy Professionals.  \u201cThis suggests a near-term diplomatic solution will be critical,\u201d she said.  Facebook said in a statement, \u201cWe are grateful for the Advocate General\u2019s opinion on these complex questions. Standard Contractual Clauses provide important safeguards to ensure that Europeans\u2019 data are protected once transferred overseas. SCCs have been designed and endorsed by the European Commission and enable thousands of Europeans to do business worldwide.\u201d  The court should follow the adviser\u2019s opinion on the clauses, said Patrick Van Eecke, global chair of law firm DLA Piper\u2019s data protection practice.  \u201cIn an open and global economy which is highly dependent of data flows crossing the national borders of countries or regions, putting up hurdles prohibiting international data transfers is not good for business and not good for people either,\u201d he said.

The retreat from the world\u2019s largest social media network is one of the sharpest responses by investors to concerns about Facebook\u2019s handling of user data.  Cambridge Analytica, a now-defunct political data firm hired by Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign, has been accused of harvesting data for 87 million Facebook users and is under investigation in the United States and Europe.  Facebook shares fell in the first quarter when the scandal broke, and recovered after founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg testified before U.S. lawmakers in April. Although he deflected questions and avoided pledging to support new regulation, doubts were raised about his commitment to fully resolve the issue.[  \"Facebook's problems, we believe, are founded on a lack of sufficient attention to consumer privacy and data security, compounded by inadequate governance,\" wrote Adam Kanzer, vice president of Domini Funds, in a May 8 letter to Facebook explaining its plan to sell its 111,000 Facebook shares held in the Domini Impact Equity Fund DSEFX.O.  In April Eaton Vance Corp EV.N unit Calvert Research and Management also sold Facebook shares on concerns about lax controls that meant \"the company clearly violated users' fundamental right to privacy,\" contrary to the firm's investment principles, according to Emma Doner, one of its Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) analysts.  The divestment by the two well-known firms build on previous concerns by other so-called ESG managers, which consider social responsibility when buying stocks.  Others may follow. Joe Keefe, president of Pax World Funds, said Facebook's place in investment vehicles like the Pax ESG Beta Dividend Fund PAXDX.O will be reviewed with an eye on recent controversies that \"may very well affect the company's scores and its eligibility for continued inclusion in those portfolios.\"  A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment.  Zuckerberg controls a majority of Facebook\u2019s voting power, but must face shareholders at its annual meeting on May 31. Top proxy advisers have recommended a number of votes contrary to the board\u2019s positions.  ESG funds represent just a small fraction of Facebook shares, but their moves may influence top investors including BlackRock Inc BLK.N and Vanguard Group, which have paid more attention to social issues in recent years. Representatives for both declined to comment.  Facebook had already faced skepticism from ESG funds which on average had kept the company at a market-neutral weighting of 1.7 percent, according to Morningstar data, likely tied to Facebook\u2019s average score from ESG rating service Sustainalytics.  Martin Kremenstein, senior managing director at Nuveen, said one reason it would be hard for the company\u2019s socially minded funds to own Facebook is because the problems occurred despite a settlement the company struck with the Federal Trade Commission in 2011, which included a pledge to improve privacy protections.  Referring to the latest revelations involving Cambridge Analytica, he said, \u201cThis is a bigger scandal than before, but it\u2019s not a new one.\u201d  Not all ESG managers aim to divest. Lauren Compere of Boston Common Asset Management said Facebook remains attractive given its strong growth and cash generation, and said the company deserved credit for steps like fighting unreasonable government requests for users\u2019 information.  Julie Goodridge of NorthStar Asset Management, with about 36,900 Facebook shares, said managers should keep their shares and vote in support of upcoming proxy resolutions like one from her firm calling for Facebook to give all shares an equal vote, which would reduce Zuckerberg\u2019s power.","1544":"FILE PHOTO: The WhatsApp messaging application is seen on a phone screen August 3, 2017.

The board, which Facebook created in response to criticism of its handling of problematic content, said it had received 20,000 cases since it opened its doors in October.  Three of the six cases involved content that Facebook removed for breaking hate speech rules.  An Oversight Board spokesman said hate speech cases had been \u201cthe most significant proportion\u201d of appeals received.  \u201cHate speech is an especially difficult area,\u201d Jamal Greene, one of the board\u2019s co-chairs and a professor at Columbia Law School, said in an interview with Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s not that easy ... for an algorithm to get the context of\u201d such speech.  In November, Facebook for the first time disclosed numbers on the prevalence of hate speech on the platform, saying that out of every 10,000 content views in the third quarter, 10 to 11 included hate speech.  The board\u2019s other chosen cases involved content removed from Facebook or Instagram for violating rules on adult nudity, dangerous individuals and organizations, and violence and incitement. Greene said they raised \u201cimportant line-drawing questions.\u201d  One case was submitted by Facebook itself. The company said this case highlighted the challenge it faced when dealing with the risks of offline harm caused by misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic.  Facebook can also ask the board for non-binding policy recommendations, but Greene said it had not yet done so.  The board has opened a week-long public comment period on the first cases, which will be reviewed by five-member panels. There is a 90-day deadline for decisions on the cases to be reached and for Facebook to act on them.  The board, which has been criticized for its limited remit, aims to start hearing cases from users in early 2021 about content that has been left on the site or taken down.

At issue were online games offered on Facebook\u2019s App Center back in 2012 in which, by playing them, a user automatically agreed to share personal data including their email address.  At the end of the game, users would see a message saying that the app could post their status, photos and other information.  Such games - including quizzes - were widely used at the time to harvest data on users of Facebook. The company subsequently overhauled its privacy settings, although they have continued to be a source of controversy.

Another pair of major brokerages cut price targets for a stock that has shed around $50 billion in value since Monday. Shares in the company fell as much as 2.5 percent in heavy trading.  In Washington, Zuckerberg\u2019s media rounds did little to satisfy lawmakers in either political party who demanded this week the billionaire testify before Congress.  Facebook was expected to brief two additional congressional committees on Thursday. Executives met with staff for the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday for nearly two hours to discuss the allegations of improper use of data on 50 million users by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.  Facebook Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman and other executives were unable to answer many questions at Wednesday\u2019s meeting, according to two aides who were present.  The Facebook executives said they had written down a list of 60 questions they pledged to answer, the aides said.  Zuckerberg on Wednesday promised tougher steps to restrict developers\u2019 access to user information, his first response to allegations that London-based Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed data to build profiles on American voters that were later used to help elect U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016.  Wall Street analysts expressed relief that there were no signs in the chief executive\u2019s status update or in subsequent interviews of a more fundamental shift in the company\u2019s advertising-driven revenue model.  Some analysts, however, said it was clear the company would have to carry extra costs to shore up its reputation in the months ahead.  Stifel analyst Scott Devitt cut his price target on Facebook by $27 to $168, while BofA Merrill Lynch slashed its target by $35 to $230. The stock fell 2 percent to $166.05.  \u201cFacebook\u2019s current plight reminds us of eBay in 2004 \u2013 an unstructured content business built on trust that lost that trust prior to implementing policies to add structure and process,\u201d Devitt said.  \u201cWe would buy all of our Buy-rated stocks and many of our Hold-rated stocks before we would buy Facebook shares.\u201d  TRUMP\u2019S USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA  Amid the storm, Trump took to Twitter to boast about his successful use of social media in the 2016 campaign.  \u201cRemember when they were saying, during the campaign, that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds, but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillary\u2019s large and highly sophisticated staff. Well, not saying that anymore!,\u201d he tweeted.  Steve Bannon, who ran Trump\u2019s campaign before falling out with the president last year, speaks at a Financial Times event on the \u201cFuture of News: Trust, Technology and Transformation in an Age of Upheaval\u201d later on Thursday.  Zuckerberg said the social network would disable access to their Facebook data more easily.  Analysts said that Zuckerberg\u2019s promises to investigate thousands of apps, and to give members a tool that lets them turn off access, would not substantially reduce advertisers\u2019 ability to use Facebook data - the company\u2019s lifeblood.  Open-source browser and app developer Mozilla said late on Wednesday it was suspending advertising on Facebook.  \u201cWe found that its current default settings leave access open to a lot of data \u2013 particularly with respect to settings for third-party apps,\u201d Mozilla said in a blog post. It would consider returning if Facebook strengthens its default privacy settings for third party apps.  The Times newspaper reported that British advertising group ISBA, which represents thousands of well-known brands, had threatened to withdraw ads if probes show user data was misused.  Asked about the Trump administration\u2019s concern over the data use and getting answers from Facebook, White House legislative director Marc Short said it was up to the company and Congress to work together in the wake of the revelations.  \u201cOf course we\u2019re concerned about that ... but at end of day Congress is the one that will make the request,\u201d Short told MSNBC in an interview, adding that lawmakers could subpoena the company if it does not comply.  \u201cIf it comes to a point that there\u2019s not cooperation, then I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see the White House weigh in,\u201d he said, adding that he has not spoken to Trump about the issue.

Facebook FB.O has been under scrutiny from regulators and shareholders after it failed to protect the data of some 87 million users that was shared with now-defunct political data firm Cambridge Analytica.

The Norwegian fund, which owns 1.4 percent of all globally listed shares, held a 0.71 percent stake in Facebook at the end of 2017, worth $3.64 billion, according to fund data.  One of the six measures would have mandated that Facebook report on \u201cfake news\u201d controversies. The others involved gender pay gaps, responsible tax principles, establishing a board committee on risk management and two measures requiring Facebook to adopt simple majority voting at shareholder meetings.

FILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is displayed on a smartphone in this illustration taken January 6, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The social media giant, which also owns photo-sharing network Instagram and messaging app WhatsApp, said it has been battling to control large volumes of misinformation such as posts that say physical distancing will not curb the disease.  Facebook has taken an uncharacteristically aggressive stance on false coronavirus posts, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg saying hoaxes about the virus pose more of a threat to users than political falsehoods, which it generally permits.  The pandemic has killed more than 136,000 people globally and infected more than 2 million, while many countries are enforcing strict lockdowns to prevent further spread.  Facebook said it has taken down hundreds of thousands of false posts that could be harmful and in March displayed warnings on another 40 million dubious claims related to the virus, without removing them.  \u201cWe will also soon begin showing messages in News Feed to people who previously engaged with harmful misinformation related to COVID-19 that we\u2019ve since removed, connecting them with accurate information,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a post.  The new alert is a concession to critics who have long called for Facebook to \u201ccorrect the record\u201d by telling users about posts it later removes or labels as false. The company previously resisted those proposals, arguing that drawing attention to dubious claims can inadvertently fuel their spread.  The notifications, which will start appearing in the coming weeks, will direct people to a World Health Organization list of common myths about the virus and encourage them to \u201chelp friends and family avoid false information,\u201d Facebook said.  The alerts will not inform users they are receiving the nudge because they had previously liked, reacted or commented on false posts, nor will they debunk specific claims.  Advocacy group AVAAZ, which has pushed the \u201ccorrect the record\u201d proposal, called the move a \u201cfirst step\u201d but said direct corrections could reduce by 50% the number of people who believe false news stories on social media.  Guy Rosen, Facebook\u2019s vice president for integrity, said the company is \u201ctesting variations in language, some more explicit,\u201d for the alerts.  The European Commissioner for values and transparency Vera Jourova welcomed the latest measures but said more still needed to be done.  \u201cWe will need more transparency and better access to data for researchers to fully verify the scope and impact of false content and to be able to assess Facebook\u2019s actions,\u201d she said in a statement.","1554":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc said on Tuesday that it was preparing for Myanmar\u2019s general election in November by improving the detection and removal of hate speech and content that incites violence and preventing the spread of misinformation.

The platform came under fire in Myanmar after a military-led crackdown in 2017 that forced more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee the country. U.N. investigators said Facebook played a key role in spreading hate speech that fuelled the violence.  The company has long said it works to stop hate speech.  Facebook said it was working with two partners in Myanmar to verify the official Facebook pages of political parties. It now has three fact-checking partners in Myanmar: BOOM, AFP Fact Check and Fact Crescendo.  The company took action against 280,000 pieces of content in Myanmar for violating its standards prohibiting hate speech in the second quarter of this year, up from 51,000 such pieces that it took action against in the first quarter.  It also said it introduced a new feature that limits the number of times a message can be forwarded to five.  The feature is now available in Myanmar and, over the course of the next few weeks, would be made available to Messenger users worldwide, the company added in the blog.  The 2020 elections in Myanmar, scheduled for Nov. 8, will be its second democratic election since the end of almost half a century of strict military rule.  The first, in 2016, brought long-time pro-democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy (NLD) to power.

He told Reuters that his team, which had been monitoring Indonesia in light of increasing tensions in Papua, had tracked the false accounts, which would disseminate content, buy ads, and drive people to other sites, to an Indonesian media firm called InsightID.  Reuters was not immediately able to reach the firm for comment.  There has been a spike in protests and unrest since late August in Papua, which suffered some of its worst bloodshed in decades in September, with 33 people killed and scores injured.[L3N26O2GS]  Researchers had independently warned in September that there had been a rise of fake Twitter and Facebook accounts on Papua, with some of the fake accounts posting pro-government content.  Agranovich said Facebook also removed fake accounts related to two other unconnected networks in the Middle East and Africa.  One, according to Facebook, was based out of Egypt, but targeted the rest of the region by posting content in support of the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, as well as criticism of Qatar, Iran, Turkey and Yemen\u2019s separatist movement.  The executive said this operation used fake accounts \u201cto masquerade as local media organizations in a variety of those countries ... and amplify the content they were posting.\u201d  According to Agranovich, Facebook found evidence some of the pages had been purchased, with regular changing ownerships, as well as deep links to Egyptian newspaper El Fagr, \u201cwhich is known for its sensationalistic content.\u201d  As a result of the investigation, Facebook has also removed El Fagr\u2019s official media pages from its platforms, he said.

Facebook said the third network, which it tracked to three marketing firms in the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Nigeria, involved fake accounts which spread on content on topics like UAE\u2019s activity in Yemen and the Iran nuclear deal.  The social media giant has recently been cracking down on such accounts after coming under fire in the last few years for its self-admitted sluggishness in developing tools to combat extremist content and propaganda operations.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc on Monday launched a \u201cSign In With Apple\u201d function to rival Facebook and Google web login accounts, drawing a contrast with rivals by stressing protection of users\u2019 information.  When users sign in with their Google or Facebook Inc profiles to third-party apps, the apps often share valuable data with Google and Facebook, a practice that Apple is looking to stop. Apple announced the move at its annual software developer conference in San Jose, California, where it also showed new features for its operating systems for iPhones, iPads and Macs and said it would retire the iTunes app after 18 years in favor of separate apps for music, movies and podcasts.  Privacy themes ran throughout the event, with Apple creating a system for its users to sign up for apps with a randomly generated email to avoid revealing their true address. The iPhone maker also tightened controls on location tracking, saying it would stop apps from scanning Bluetooth and Wi-Fi networks to guess a user\u2019s location even when the user has disabled tracking.  Apple has emphasized privacy in effort to set itself from rivals such as Facebook and Google, both of whom use data to boost their advertising businesses and whose practices have come under scrutiny.  \u201cLocation-based tracking, for example, is much more nefarious than most people realize,\u201d said Bob O\u2019Donnell, head of TECHnalysis Research. \u201cYou can find out more about someone from their location than things like what they\u2019re searching for.\u201d  Apple is unlikely to make any money directly off the new services, analysts said. Instead, features like the web sign-on are likely to drive brand loyalty by making it easier for users to log into apps without having to juggle multiple passwords, said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies.  But Apple, whose iPhone sales have started to fall after nearly a decade of sustained growth, is also working to persuade consumers that its hardware is worth its higher price in part because it protects their data. Bajarin said Apple appears to be working to \u201cfirewall\u201d off its customers from data collection practices it disagrees with.  \u201cYou look at all these regulations that have come down...and the goal of them is to give consumers more control over their data. Apple is saying, if you guys aren\u2019t going to do it - and they\u2019re talking to the other big companies - we\u2019ll do it for our customers,\u201d Bajarin said.  Apple closed down 1% at $173.30.

REUTERS\/Elijah Nouvelage  SAN FRANCISCO\/NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tim Cook\u2019s charm offensive is coming just at the right time. The Apple boss has Washington and even Beijing on his side, while Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg can barely speak without annoying someone in power \u2013 and his company\u2019s apps are blocked in China. Yet since D.C. pressure ratcheted up a year ago, Facebook\u2019s stock has performed better.  Zuckerberg has proved a poor advocate for his company. His assertion of nonpartisanship has fallen on deaf ears, both Republican and Democratic. He has been summoned to testify before Congress twice in the last two years. Last week, his defense of Facebook\u2019s Libra cryptocurrency project failed to allay skeptics\u2019 fears.  Meanwhile, Cook has successfully managed a mercurial Donald Trump. He has met the U.S. president and won tariff exemptions for Apple amid growing import taxes on Chinese goods. Despite accusations that the company\u2019s App Store has anti-competitive elements, Cook hasn\u2019t had to testify in Congress since 2016. Pulling an app used by Hong Kong protestors to track police movements curried favor with Beijing yet didn\u2019t do much damage to the iPhone maker\u2019s reputation.  But Apple\u2019s huge, mature and complex business \u2013 worth over $1 trillion in market capitalization \u2013 means it has to play more defense. Over the last year, Apple\u2019s stock has underperformed the Nasdaq 100 tech index. In the July to September quarter, Apple reported only 2% growth in its top line, and a 2% decline in Greater China sales. IPhone sales in the People\u2019s Republic fell to their lowest level in five years in the period, according to Canalys, while rival Huawei Technologies gained a record 42% market share.  At one time Zuckerberg was besotted with gaining access to China but he has changed his tune. In a recent speech at Georgetown University, he cited Beijing\u2019s censorship policy as a reason. For the time being, he may have lucked out in political terms. The social network still pulled in $5 billion in revenue from Chinese ad sales in 2018, according to Pivotal Research.  More broadly, the $540 billion Facebook\u2019s advertising juggernaut keeps throwing off sales growth. It reported a 29% year-on-year rise in third-quarter revenue to nearly $18 billion, almost all ads. A $5 billion Federal Trade Commission fine imposed in July is a distant memory and its shares have outperformed the Nasdaq benchmark over the last year. Luckily for Facebook, it doesn\u2019t need diplomatic skills like Cook\u2019s as much as Apple does.","1561":"FILE PHOTO: Silhouettes of mobile users are seen next to a screen projection of Facebook logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018.

Facebook said it looked forward to resolving the lawsuit quickly after it recently introduced tools for people to see who is buying political ads on its social network.  A representative for Google could not immediately be reached for comment. Like Facebook, Google has pledged to create an online archive of ads that run on its service.

ByteDance has agreed to divest parts of TikTok, sources have said, under pressure from the White House which has threatened to ban it and other Chinese-owned apps over data security concerns.  The launch of Reels escalates a bruising fight between Facebook and TikTok, with each casting the other as a threat. Both have been eager to attract American teenagers, many of whom have flocked to TikTok in the last two years.  Reels was first tested in Brazil in 2018 and then later in France, Germany and India, which was TikTok\u2019s biggest market until the Indian government banned it last month following a border clash with China. Facebook also tried out a standalone app called Lasso which did not gain much traction.  Similar to TikTok, Reels users can record short mobile-friendly vertical videos, then add special effects and soundtracks pulled from a music library.  Those similarities led TikTok Chief Executive Kevin Mayer to call Reels a \u201ccopycat product\u201d that could coast on Instagram\u2019s enormous existing user base after \u201ctheir other copycat Lasso failed quickly.\u201d  Facebook faced similar charges at a congressional hearing on U.S. tech companies\u2019 alleged abuse of market power last week, with lawmakers suggesting the company has copied rivals like Snapchat for anti-competitive reasons.

In particular, the Silicon Valley firm has drawn global scrutiny since disclosing earlier this year that a third-party personality quiz distributed on Facebook gathered profile information on 87 million users worldwide and sold the data to British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.  Washington, D.C., Attorney General Karl Racine said the U.S. capital city was suing Facebook, accusing it of misleading users because it had known about the incident for two years before disclosing it.

Facebook acknowledged the lapse in a blog post but said it had not found evidence of wrongdoing by those partners.

Sure looks like he lied.\u201d  Incoming Republican senator Josh Hawley made similar comments about Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony.  The stock slide was the worst since the owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram warned in July that profit margins would erode in coming years because of consumer and government pressure to better guard data and suppress objectionable content.  \u201cFacebook could have prevented third parties from misusing its consumers\u2019 data had it implemented and maintained reasonable oversight of third-party applications,\u201d according to the lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of Washington, D.C., on Wednesday.  The court could award unspecified damages and impose a civil penalty of up to $5,000 per violation of the district\u2019s consumer protection law, or potentially close to $1.7 billion, if penalized for each consumer affected. The lawsuit alleges the quiz software had data on 340,000 D.C. residents, though just 852 users had directly engaged with it.  \u2018CONFUSING SETTINGS\u2019  Facebook offered separate privacy settings around 2013 to control what friends on the network could see and what data could be accessed by apps, enabling the quiz and other services to collect details about users\u2019 Facebook friends without many of them realizing it, according to the lawsuit.

Since then, Facebook has disclosed a pair of security breaches involving profile data and posts of up to 29 million users and 6.8 million users, respectively.  At least six U.S. states have ongoing investigations into Facebook, according to state officials.  In March, a bipartisan coalition of 37 state attorneys wrote to the company, demanding to know more about the Cambridge Analytica data and its possible links to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign.  At the same time, the Federal Trade Commission took the unusual step of announcing an investigation into whether Facebook had violated a 2011 consent decree, exposing the company to a multi-billion dollar fine.

An open letter written to Facebook\u2019s leadership by 11 employees on one internal platform, and seen by Reuters, demands company leaders acknowledge and denounce \u201canti-Muslim bigotry\u201d and ensure more policy consistency.  The letter also demanded that Facebook\u2019s \u201cpolicy team in India (and elsewhere) includes diverse representation.\u201d  \u201cIt is hard not to feel frustrated and saddened by the incidents reported ...

Facebook has been under fire in recent years for its lax approach to fake news content, state-backed disinformation campaigns and violent content spread via its platforms.  The WSJ article said Das had told staff that applying hate-speech rules to politicians close to Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) \u201cwould damage the company\u2019s business prospects in the country.\u201d  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Following the report, in response to Reuters queries on the matter, Facebook said it prohibits hate speech that incites violence and enforces policies without regard to political position or party affiliation.  \u201cWhile we know there is more to do, we\u2019re making progress on enforcement and conduct regular audits,\u201d said the company, which has more than 300 million users in India.

Mohan also wrote the company is \u201cconfident that the article\u2019s claim that political affiliations influence decision making in India is inaccurate and without merit.\u201d  A spokesman for the WSJ did not respond to a request for comment.  India\u2019s opposition Congress Party has called for a parliamentary probe into Facebook, while BJP lawmakers in turn have accused Facebook of censoring nationalist voices.

Christopher Wylie, who previously revealed that consultancy Cambridge Analytica had accessed the data of 50 million Facebook users to build voter profiles on behalf of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, said AggregateIQ (AIQ) had built software called Ripon to profile voters.  Wylie was giving evidence to a British parliamentary committee over the scandal, minutes after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg declined to appear before the legislators to discuss what went wrong.  The head of the committee called Zuckerberg\u2019s decision \u201castonishing\u201d and urged him to think again.  CNN said Zuckerberg had decided to testify before the U.S. Congress.  The revelations around Facebook data have hammered the stock price of the world\u2019s biggest social network and raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers and lead to tougher regulation.  \u201cThere\u2019s now tangible proof in the public domain that AIQ actually built Ripon, which is the software that utilised the algorithms from the Facebook data,\u201d Wylie told the British Parliament\u2019s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee.  Facebook is facing intense scrutiny after Wylie\u2019s revelations about improper use of personal data and the role that could have played in the 2016 U.S. election.  Zuckerberg apologised last week for the mistakes Facebook had made and promised tougher steps to restrict third-party access to such information.  Ripon, the Wisconsin town where the Republican Party was founded in 1854, was the name given to a tool that let a campaign manage its voter database, target specific voters, conduct canvassing, manage fundraising and carry out surveys.  AggregateIQ did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the remarks. The company previously told Reuters that it had never been and is not a part of Cambridge Analytica nor ever entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica.  Cambridge Analytica said it had not shared any of the Facebook profile data with AggregateIQ.  The Canadian federal agency charged with protecting privacy rights of individuals said on Tuesday that it has contacted its counterpart in British Columbia to discuss the provincial office\u2019s review of AggregateIQ.  ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING  With the scandal around Facebook widening, Britain\u2019s cross-party media committee had invited Zuckerberg to parliament to explain how personal data had ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica, the London-based political consultancy which was working on the Trump campaign.  The company said he had asked one of his deputies to attend the hearing in London, suggesting that Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer or Chief Product Officer Chris Cox had the expertise to answer questions on the complex subject.  \u201cThese issues must be addressed at the most senior levels of the company by those in an authoritative position,\u201d wrote Rebecca Stimson, head of public policy, Facebook UK.  \u201cAs such Mr Zuckerberg has personally asked one of his deputies to make themselves available to give evidence in person to the committee.\u201d  Damian Collins, the head of Britain\u2019s media committee, asked the company to rethink. \u201cGiven the extraordinary evidence that we\u2019ve heard so far today... it is absolutely astonishing that Mark Zuckerberg is not prepared to submit himself to questioning,\u201d he said.  Wylie was also quizzed on the use of data in the 2016 Brexit referendum, which has become a hot topic in Britain.  Whistleblowers have has said the main campaign for leaving the EU broke the law on spending limits by spending money with another Brexit campaign group that it was closely affiliated with, a claim denied by senior Brexit campaigners.  Vote Leave denies any wrongdoing.

Some 228 local newspapers folded in Britain between 2005 and 2017, according to the Press Gazette, many of them closed by the publishers involved in the Facebook scheme.

The junta seized power on Monday in a coup against the democratically elected government of Suu Kyi in response to what the army said was \u201celection fraud.\u201d [L4N2KA47K]  Military authorities banned Facebook Inc - which counts half of the population as users - until at least February 7th for the sake of \u201cstability\u201d, after the junta\u2019s opponents began using the platform to organize.  But it took several hours for internet providers to enforce the ban, during which time activists began creating Twitter accounts and sharing them on their Facebook profiles, according to a review of social media messages.  Twitter was by Friday among the top five most downloaded apps on both the Google and Apple stores, according to data from research firm SensorTower.  Out of around 1,500 new Twitter accounts reviewed by Reuters and activated in the last two days using Myanmar related hashtags, most identified themselves as being opposed to the military government, while a handful of accounts were pro-military and posted links to the junta\u2019s press releases.  Some pro-democracy activists used the hashtag #MilkTeaAlliance, to appeal for support to cross-border youth movements pushing for democracy.  The hashtag, which started in Thailand in April, is used prominently by Hong Kong, Thai, and Taiwanese activists, with Twitter becoming a key soapbox for the region\u2019s pro-democracy activists.  Twitter declined to comment on the surge of users in Myanmar.","1599":"The Netflix logo is shown in this illustration photograph in Encinitas, California October 14, 2014. Netflix Inc shares were down 3.1 percent at $435.28 after the announcement. Picture taken October 14, 2014. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Netflix\u2019s advantage is Facebook\u2019s weakness. Subscriptions give the video-streaming service an edge \u2013 and an incentive for boss Reed Hastings to keep customers\u2019 data close by. Cash burn is always a risk but for now Netflix is handily outperforming its FAANG associate.  Netflix is part of the gang of stocks that includes Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet, but lately it stands out from the pack. The stock was up 60 percent this year as of Monday\u2019s close, more than double second-place Amazon\u2019s rise. Zuckerberg\u2019s dorm-room creation has declined nearly 7 percent over the same period.  The shares jumped another 5 percent following the closing bell after the company reported it added more than 8 million paying customers in the first quarter, giving it a total of nearly 119 million worldwide. Crucially, the company is showing it can boost prices without denting customer growth. For example, it hiked the cost of its mid-level tier subscriptions by $1 to $10.99 in the United States last year.  Netflix\u2019s subscription model contrasts sharply with Facebook, which depends on advertising for nearly all of its $40 billion in annual revenue. Facebook argues that the vast amounts of information it collects on its 2 billion members helps Madison Avenue better target companies\u2019 products and services. A recent data leak that exposed the accounts of 87 million Facebook members suggests that the trade-off may not be fair. While Zuckerberg parried calls for regulation at congressional hearings last week, the risk of political interference continues to hang over the business.  Netflix is a data hound too. It mines the viewing habits of subscribers to suggest other TV shows or produce certain types of movies. That gives Hastings a reason to keep data close to the vest. Netflix doesn\u2019t release ratings.  The producer behind \u201cStranger Things\u201d is not without challenges. Hastings warned that the company is on track to burn up to $4 billion in cash this year and will be cash-flow negative for several more years as it spends heavily on original content. If Netflix fails to attract more people to the service or maintain its ability to raise prices, the model could fray. For now, though, Zuckerberg would love to have Hastings\u2019 problems.","1600":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Google and Facebook took particularly sharp jabs for alleged abuse of their market power from Democrats and Republicans on Wednesday in a much-anticipated congressional hearing that put four of America\u2019s most prominent tech CEOs in the hot seat.  The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives antitrust panel holding the hearing said afterwards that the four CEOs had acknowledged concerning behavior.  \u201cWhat we heard from witnesses at the hearing confirmed the evidence that we have collected over the last year,\u201d Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat, told Reuters.  Facebook Inc\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Google owner Alphabet Inc\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Apple Inc\u2019s Tim Cook - whose companies have a combined market value of about $5 trillion - parried a range of accusations that they crippled smaller rivals in their quest for market share.  The videoconference hearing was the first time the four CEOs have appeared together before lawmakers.  Though it was Bezos\u2019 first congressional testimony, he appeared the least fazed. Cook drew fewer barbed questions than Bezos and handled them efficiently. Zuckerberg suffered the most damage, stumbling at times when confronted with internal emails.  Pichai, CEO of both Alphabet and Google, took the most heat from conservatives on the panel and looked the worse for it, as he repeatedly told lawmakers he would be happy to look into various situations and get back to them.  The Big Tech hearing triggered scorn from viewers over its own tech issues. Bezos escaped questioning for about an hour in what may have been a tech issue and was caught on screen reaching for what appeared to be a snack.  Poor audio, flat-screen televisions switching off, and chief executives appearing together as thumbnails on a large screen led to mockery of the virtual set-up on Twitter.  Lawmakers descended into shouting at each other at points, with a pandemic twist. One yelled: \u201cPut your mask on!\u201d  THEFT, COPYING, CONTENT MODERATION  Cicilline set the tone for the hearing when he began by accusing Google of theft. \u201cWhy does Google steal content from honest businesses?\u201d he asked. He alleged Google stole reviews from Yelp Inc and threatened to delist Yelp from search results if it objected.  Pichai responded mildly that he would want to know the specifics of the accusation. \u201cWe conduct ourselves to the highest standards,\u201d he added, disagreeing with the characterization.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg took a series of questions about the company\u2019s purchase of Instagram in 2012 and whether it was acquired because it was a threat, as he dubbed it in an email obtained by the committee.  Zuckerberg responded that Instagram at the time was a tiny photo-sharing app rather than a social-media phenomenon.  In one of the more notable exchanges, Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat, pushed Zuckerberg on whether Facebook had ever copied its competitors. \u201cWe\u2019ve certainly adapted features that others have led in,\u201d he said.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  \u201cHow many companies did Facebook end up copying?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs it less than five? Less than 50?\u201d  \u201cCongresswoman, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Zuckerberg said.  Jayapal pressed Amazon\u2019s Bezos on whether the company used data from third-party sellers in making sales decisions. An Amazon executive previously had denied the practice under oath and was contradicted by a news report.  Bezos answered cautiously that the company had a policy against such actions. \u201cIf we found that somebody violated it, we would take action against them,\u201d he said.  On the Republican side, Representative Jim Jordan accused the companies of hampering conservatives from reaching their supporters. Jordan pressed Pichai on whether Google would help former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, win in November.  \u201cWe support both campaigns. We approach our work in a nonpartisan fashion,\u201d Pichai responded.  Representative Matt Gaetz asked Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg whether content moderators disadvantaged conservative content. Zuckerberg said they were trained to be neutral.  \u201cSTREET FIGHT\u201d  Apple\u2019s Cook rejected the notion there is nothing to stop his company from raising the commissions it charges in the App Store.  \u201cI disagree strongly with that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe competition for developers - they can write their apps for Android or Windows or Xbox or PlayStation. We have fierce competition at the developer side and the customer side, which is essentially so competitive I would describe it as a street fight.\u201d  A detailed report with antitrust allegations against the four tech platforms and recommendations on how to tame their market power could be released by late summer or early fall by the committee, senior committee aides said.","1601":"(Reuters) - Libra Association, the entity managing the Facebook Inc-led effort to build global digital currency Libra, on Wednesday named Stuart Levey as its first chief executive officer.  Levey is currently serving as Chief Legal Officer of HSBC.  The prospect of Facebook\u2019s 2.5 billion users adopting Libra has led to intense scrutiny from global regulators, with many worried its launch could erode national control over money.  Libra\u2019s most prominent original backers, including payments giants Mastercard Inc, Visa Inc and PayPal Holdings Inc, also ditched the project in the wake of the scrutiny.  In April, its governing body said Libra will be linked to individual national currencies and overseen by global watchdogs, in a scaled-back revamp it hopes will win regulatory approval.  The original plan was for Libra, which was unveiled last June, to be backed by a wide mixture of currencies and government debt. But central banks and regulators feared the cryptocurrency could destabilise monetary policy, facilitate money laundering and erode users\u2019 privacy, with some threatening to block it.  Libra, which had planned to launch by the end of June, now aims to do so between mid-November and the end of the year.","1602":"Britain's Prime Minister, Theresa May, leaves 10 Downing Street, in central London, Britain March 21, 2018.

Facebook\u2019s shares fell 5.2 percent on a Bloomberg report that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was investigating the company over its use of personal data after a whistleblower said a political consultancy improperly accessed information on 50 million users to sway public opinion.  The stock sank almost 7 percent on Monday, sparking a broad sell-off. U.S. and European lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how the consultancy gained access to the data and why Facebook failed to inform its users, raising broader industry questions about consumer privacy.  Shares of Snap fell nearly 4 percent, while Twitter\u2019s shares tumbled 9.2 percent. The S&P technology index was down 0.2 percent.  \u201cNot all the overhang has cleared, there\u2019s still some anxiety.

Still, the declining stocks outnumbered the stocks that gained on the NYSE for a 1.19-to-1 ratio, and for 1.13-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.  Oil prices rose about 2 percent, helped by tensions in the Middle East and the possibility of further falls in Venezuelan output.

Financial stocks edged up 0.4 percent as investors prepare for a near-certain interest rate hike at the end of the Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day meeting on Wednesday.  But the bigger question is how aggressive the central bank will be with monetary policy after that, as it gradually ends a nine year run of easy money for the financial system.  Traders currently expect two more rate hikes this year, although they said policymakers could set a hawkish tone by forecasting four increases in their \u201cdot plot\u201d projections.  \u201cOur base case is the Fed would raise four times this year, and that would not have a material impact to the equity markets to the upside,\u201d said Navarro.

Sandy Parakilas, who was in charge of policing Facebook\u2019s data handling procedures in 2011 and 2012, shed fresh light on business practices that are alleged to have enabled Cambridge Analytica to gain unauthorised access to the personal data of tens of millions of U.S. voters.  The social networking giant has been rocked this week after a whistleblower said Cambridge Analytica, which U.S. President Donald Trump hired for his 2016 election campaign, improperly accessed information on Facebook users to build detailed profiles on American voters.  \u201cThere was very little detection or enforcement,\u201d Parakilas said in testimony via videolink before the House of Common\u2019s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. \u201cDuring my 16 months (at Facebook), I don\u2019t remember a single physical audit of a developer\u201d who was storing users\u2019 data from the social network.  Parakilas highlighted vast potential abuses of a little-understood feature known as \u201cfriend permissions\u201d, which enabled software developers to connect their apps up to the friends of users, and even the friends of friends, the so-called \u201csocial graph\u201d at the heart of Facebook\u2019s network of connections.  \u201cYou are likely talking about tens of thousands of apps that got \u2018friend permissions\u2019 and some of those apps had tens - it was huge - or hundreds of millions of users, so there was a vast (amount) of data that passed out the door,\u201d Parakilas said.  Facebook turned off the friend permissions feature in 2015.  Asked by a parliamentary committee member whether there were incidents where this data-sharing feature was misused, Parakilas said: \u201cThere may well have been. However, Facebook did not investigate deeply enough to determine exactly.\u201d  Facebook declined to comment directly on the testimony of the ex-employee. In announcing the suspension of Cambridge Analytica and related researchers from Facebook late last week, it said it now requires app developers to justify any data they collect and how they are going to use it: \u201cIn the past five years, we have made significant improvements in our ability to detect and prevent violations by app developers.\u201d  Parakilas, who now works as a product manager at Uber, said he had warned senior executives at Facebook. He said in a Guardian interview this week that he left in frustration over the company\u2019s failure to exercise more oversight on privacy issues.  One committee member pointedly asked whether Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive, was aware of the issue. Parakilas said he did not know first-hand, but he added: \u201cI don\u2019t think it was a secret that this was a problem.\u201d  \u201cIt was well understood both internally and externally that there were risks with respect to the way the Facebook platform was handling data,\u201d he said.

Justice Department investigates Apple:  This probe, revealed in June 2019, appears to focus on Apple\u2019s app store.

Slideshow ( 11 images )  NOT POPULAR, BUT DOMINANT  Mundt\u2019s case rests on his analysis that Facebook has a market share of social media in Germany of over 90 percent - he sees its only direct competitor as Google+ - making it dominant in anti-trust terms and not, as Facebook argues, merely popular.  \u201cIf Facebook has a dominant market position, then the consent that the user gives for his data to be used is no longer voluntary,\u201d said Mundt, 57, a jurist who has headed the cartel office since 2013.  \u201cThat\u2019s because he has no alternative - he has to use Facebook if he wants to use a social network.\u201d  Facebook, which has more than 2 billion users worldwide, describes Mundt\u2019s view as \u201cinaccurate\u201d but has said it will cooperate with the investigation, which would not result in fines but could lead to some practices being banned.  It is due to submit its response to Mundt\u2019s findings soon. This will then lead to a dialogue on whether Facebook should change its practices voluntarily or, possibly, be ordered to do so.  Separately, the data protection commissioner for Hamburg, the city-state where Facebook has its German office, has launched a non-compliance procedure after being dissatisfied by the firm\u2019s explanation over the Cambridge Analytica leak.  The scrutiny from German regulators enjoys the backing of lawmakers, reflecting broader hostility toward anything resembling surveillance that goes back to Germany\u2019s history of Nazi and Communist rule in the 20th century.  Mundt pushed back against suggestions that, in taking on the case, he was encroaching on the domain of data protection authorities. He said there was a solid precedent in Germany for inappropriate terms of use to be treated as an anti-trust issue.  \u201cThe competitive connection is particularly strong from our point of view, because data are intrinsic to the business model,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe entire business model relies ultimately on access to data and the reach of these platforms,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the Facebook probe we are doing pioneering work - but in no way is this an experiment.\u201d","1615":"(Reuters) - Myanmar\u2019s junta blocked Facebook on Thursday, trying to shut off an important channel for opposition to this week\u2019s military coup as sporadic protests flared.

REUTERS\/Issei Kato  Military ruler General Min Aung Hlaing has moved quickly to consolidate his hold after overthrowing elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and detaining her and allied politicians on Monday.  He told a business group on Wednesday he could keep power for six months after a one-year state of emergency ends in order to hold what he said he would be fair elections.  But in a show of defiance to the generals, a group of the lawmakers elected in a Nov. 8 ballot convened a symbolic parliamentary session in the quarters where they have been staying since the takeover.  Small protests took place in the main city Yangon and elsewhere, with activists saying three protesters had been arrested - among around 150 people who have been detained since the coup, according to one rights group.  Doctors were also spearheading a campaign of civil disobedience.  But in a country with a bloody history of crackdowns on demonstrations, there was no mass outpouring of opposition on the streets.  The army seized power on Monday alleging irregularities in the election, derailing Myanmar\u2019s long and troubled transition to democracy. The move was condemned by Western governments, who have urged the junta to respect Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy\u2019s landslide victory.  The U.N. Security Council called on Thursday for the release of Suu Kyi and other detainees, and voiced concern over the state of emergency. But it stopped short of condemning the coup.  Council members include China and Russia, who have traditionally shielded Myanmar from significant council action. China also has a big economic interest in Myanmar.  Opposition to the junta has emerged strongly on Facebook, Myanmar\u2019s main social media platform, including for business and government.  The Ministry of Communications and Information said Facebook would be blocked until this Sunday, Feb. 7, because users were \u201cspreading fake news and misinformation and causing misunderstanding\u201d. Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp messaging was also blocked.  Facebook was still available sporadically and demonstrators in the second city of Mandalay used it to livestream the first street protest since the coup.  \u201cPeople\u2019s protest against military coup,\u201d read one banner.  The group of around 20 people chanted: \u201cOur arrested leaders, release now, release now.\u201d  Three people were arrested after the protest, student groups said. Reuters was unable to contact police for comment.  A dozen or so people also staged a protest in the main city of Yangon but dispersed quickly.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  At least 147 people have been detained since the coup, including activists, lawmakers and officials from Suu Kyi\u2019s government, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) said.  DISOBEDIENCE  Staff at some government hospitals stopped work on Wednesday or wore ribbons in the NLD\u2019s red colour. In response, the army said people could get treatment in military hospitals.  Pictures shared on Wednesday showed workers at the agriculture ministry joining the campaign of disobedience.  Other signs of anger have emerged. For a third night, people in Yangon and other cities banged on pots and pans and honked car horns. In Yangon, streets resounded to the sound of clapping at 5 p.m. (1030 GMT) by coup opponents.  \u201cLights are shining in the dark,\u201d said Min Ko Naing, a veteran of past campaigns against military rule, in a call to action. \u201cWe need to show how many people are against this unfair coup.\u201d  Suu Kyi, 75, has not been seen since her arrest along with other party leaders. Police have filed charges against her of illegally importing and using six walkie-talkie radios found at her home and she has been detained until Feb. 15.  The daughter of the former British colony\u2019s independence hero Aung San and the longtime leader of its democracy movement, Suu Kyi spent about 15 years under house arrest between 1989 and 2010. She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.  She remains hugely popular at home despite damage to her international reputation over the plight of Muslim Rohingya refugees.  The new junta has declared a one-year state of emergency, but Min Aung Hlaing told a business group he could stay on beyond that.  \u201cThe army had to take charge for several reasons, but will not go beyond the democratic path,\u201d he was quoted as saying by pro-army People Media.  The NLD won about 80% of the parliament seats in the November election and trounced a pro-military party, according to the election commission. The army refused to accept the result, citing unsubstantiated allegations of fraud.  The United Nations said it would step up international pressure to ensure the will of the people is respected. Washington said it was reviewing possible sanctions.

Based on the company\u2019s estimated earnings, Facebook\u2019s shares were trading at about the cheapest they have been since the social network\u2019s initial public offering nearly six years ago.  The stock\u2019s woes continued on Tuesday, dropping 3.5 percent to sink as much as 17 percent below last month\u2019s all-time high, as investors grappled with risks facing Facebook following reports a political consultancy may have improperly gained access to data on 50 million users.  Facebook said on Tuesday it would face questions this week from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) about the data acquired by Cambridge Analytica. It said it had no indication of a formal investigation.  The FTC is reviewing whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent decree it reached with the authority over its privacy practices, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.  OakBrook Investments, which owns Facebook shares, will discuss in coming days whether to buy more following the sharp pullback, said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer of the Lisle, Illinois firm.  \u201cWe were expecting some increase in the costs of policing data and we thought the stock\u2019s valuation was still cheap relative to what those costs would be,\u201d Jankovskis said. \u201cThey are going to be fighting on a political front to defend their actions and what they have in place, but I don\u2019t see any really major changes to how they do business coming about out of this.\u201d  Investors are drawn to Facebook for its torrid growth expected over the next few years. After increasing revenue by about 50 percent a year on average over the past five years, Facebook is expected by analysts to increase revenue by at least 23 percent a year through 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data.  \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many of those out there, particularly of Facebook\u2019s size,\u201d Jankovskis said of Facebook, whose market value fell below $500 billion on Tuesday but remains one of the biggest U.S. companies by market capitalization. As of Monday, Facebook\u2019s shares were trading at about 22.6 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, their cheapest level since dipping to 22.2 times in early 2017, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.  With Tuesday\u2019s intraday decline, the stock was trading for about 21.5 times earnings estimates. Last year, it traded above 30 times forward estimates and nearly 60 times in 2014.  Facebook\u2019s premium over the S&P 500 technology sector , which trades at about 19 times forward estimates, was also the smallest it has ever been, according to Datastream.  \u201cIf you are an investor that does not have a stake in Facebook and maybe you have been watching the stock and you have wanted to own it but you just did not want to pay up for it ... that discount should be compelling,\u201d said Jason Ware, chief investment officer with Albion Financial Group in Salt Lake City.  The question facing investors is whether Facebook\u2019s financial outlook will weaken. For example, if the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree, it has the power to fine the company thousands of dollars a day per violation.  None of the more than 40 analysts followed by Thomson Reuters had yet reduced their revenue or earnings estimates as the data controversy erupted over the past few days.  Indeed, the potential for tighter regulation or damage to Facebook\u2019s reputation was cause for concern, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia, which he said owned Facebook but was not buying any more.  \u201cYou just have to wonder whether the estimates that you see out there are accurate now or whether they will be negatively affected by the adverse publicity that the company is getting,\u201d Tuz said.  Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago, said he would wait for at least a few weeks before deciding whether to invest in Facebook.  \u201cYou don\u2019t know right now how much the government is going to get involved...,\u201d Nolte said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know if the business model is going to change significantly.\u201d","1621":"July 1 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble said Wednesday that it will not make any announcements about its activities on advertising platforms, in response to a question about whether it will join the growing advertising boycott against Facebook .  \u201cOur approach has been to not to make public declarations of where we stand with individual partners,\u201d a P&G spokesman said. \u201cWe are not changing that approach, so you shouldn\u2019t expect to hear more from us on Facebook, or any other advertising platform.

Shares of the social media network rose nearly 12 percent to $168 in trading before the bell on Thursday, with at least 17 analysts raising their price targets on the stock.  Analysts said Facebook is taking cue from the early success of its popular Stories feature and will invest significantly in getting more advertisers on board to the format, which has further upside in terms of pricing.  The Stories format is used by about 2 million advertisers out of Facebook\u2019s total 7 million active advertisers, and the company said it would add more features to make it easier for advertisers to adapt their campaigns.  Facebook has intentionally kept ad unit pricing for Stories 20 percent to 50 percent lower than News Feed as it works to improve performance and could bring a double-barreled benefit to ad revenue growth if it can improve ad efficacy, Morgan Stanley analysts said.  More than 2.7 billion users interact with at least one of Facebook\u2019s apps each month, up from 2.6 billion last quarter.  \u201cThe bottom line is that with more than a quarter of the world using FB every day, we think advertisers have no choice but to follow their customers,\u201d Macquarie Research analysts said.","1624":"NEW YORK, March 19 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dropped on Monday, with the S&P and Nasdaq suffering their worst day in just over five weeks, as concerns over increased regulation for large tech companies was spearheaded by a plunge in Facebook shares.

The prosecutors did not name the companies, but Taiwan-based Quanta Computer Inc confirmed after Rimasauskas\u2019 arrest that it was the Asian vendor, and a Lithuanian court order in 2017 identified Google and Facebook as the victims.  The scheme defrauded Google out of $23 million and Facebook out of $99 million, according to that order. Prosecutors said Rimasauskas contributed to the scheme by setting up a fake company and a bank account in Latvia.  The scheme is an example of a growing type of fraud called \u201cbusiness email compromise,\u201d in which fraudsters ask for money using emails targeted at companies that work with foreign suppliers or regularly make wire transfers.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation said in February 2017 that losses from such scams since the agency began tracking them in 2013 totaled more than $3 billion.","1631":"BEIJING, July 24 (Reuters) - Facebook has set up a subsidiary in China with registered capital of $30 million, a filing on China\u2019s National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System showed.

FILE PHOTO: The WhatsApp messaging application is seen on a phone screen August 3, 2017. REUTERS\/Thomas White\/File Photo  Facebook\u2019s messaging firm, which has a user base of more than 200 million in India, has been trying to break into the country\u2019s payments space. Its move to comply with storage norms could potentially threaten entrenched players such as SoftBank and Alibaba-backed Paytm.  Foreign payment companies were caught off guard in April by the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s (RBI\u2019s) one-page directive that said all payments data should, within six months, be stored only in the country for \u201cunfettered supervisory access\u201d.  \u201cIn response to India\u2019s payments data circular, we\u2019ve built a system that stores payments-related data locally in India,\u201d WhatsApp said in an emailed statement.  The Menlo Park, Calif.-based firm began testing payments in India with 1 million users earlier this year.  But a formal roll out has been delayed amid false messages circulating on the platform that have led to mob lynchings and more government scrutiny, according to local media.  Reuters has previously reported that a lack of clarity about local data storage norms has also delayed a formal launch of WhatsApp\u2019s inter-bank money transfer service.  Its compliance with data storage comes at a time when, according to sources, several other global payments firms are seeking extensions on the Oct. 15 data localization deadline.  Some are asking for data mirroring that would allow data storage overseas along with a copy in India, as this would be easier to comply with, multiple sources have told Reuters.  Mastercard, Visa, PayPal, Google, Amazon and Facebook met Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley last week to secure an extension of the deadline for local storage of payments data, a source said.  Google, PayPal and Facebook declined comment, while Mastercard, Visa and Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The RBI did not have an immediate comment.","1633":"BENGALURU\/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook contractor Genpact has raised minimum wages for the content moderation teams it runs for the Silicon Valley firm in India, the latest sign of improvement for workers after reports of stressful conditions at the social network\u2019s sites globally.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Facebook Inc has unveiled several initiatives in the past six months to support wellbeing in teams doing the sometimes grueling and repetitive work of wading through billions of potentially harmful or violent posts on its platforms.  Reuters reported in February on a group of workers at Genpact\u2019s offices in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, who described the work they did as underpaid, stressful and sometimes traumatic.  Facebook at that time rejected the Hyderabad employees\u2019 assertions about low pay, saying it paid competitive wages for the Indian market.  Two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday that Genpact has since more than doubled minimum salaries for new recruits to its Facebook teams to 250,000 Indian rupees ($3,503) a year.  Based on job adverts and employee paystubs, Reuters reported earlier that the starting salary for some graduate content moderators was just 100,000 Indian rupees ($1,401).  \u201cWe can confirm that Genpact did recently raise salaries for our team in India that supports Facebook as part of an annual review process that emphasizes paying a competitive market rate,\u201d the India-based technology outsourcing company said, responding to Reuters questions.  As of February, Genpact employed more than 1,600 employees in its Facebook teams in Hyderabad, more than 10% of the 15,000 the social network said were working on content moderation worldwide.  One of the sources said that the recent hikes applied only to new recruits and were not applicable to existing workers.  Both Facebook and Genpact declined to comment on the details of the increase in pay, but the Indian company added in its statement that the rise \u201creinforces our commitment to our employees and helps us attract and retain top talent.\u201d  Facebook in May raised minimum wages for U.S. content moderators to $18 to $22 per hour depending on location from $15 nationwide, and last week said it is still studying increases in other countries.  The Genpact unit in Hyderabad reviews posts in English as well as a host of Indian languages, Arabic, and some Afghan and Asian tribal dialects, according to Facebook.","1634":"Sept 28 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc has discovered a security issue affecting about 50 million user accounts, the company said on Friday.

The complaint said that EU lawmakers, on accessing the virus test site, discovered that it had sent over 150 third-party requests, including requests to U.S.-based companies Google and Stripe, in breach of an EU court judgment in July last year.  A number of these third-party requests were for user data in targeted advertising and to enable software to function smoothly.  \u201cThe main issues raised are the deceptive cookies banners of an internal corona testing website, the vague and unclear data protection notice, and the illegal transfer of data to the U.S.,\u201d Noyb said in a statement.  Cookies are used by companies to track online browsing behaviour, key to online advertising.  Schrems said the EU parliament should have known better.  \u201cPublic authorities, and in particular the EU institutions, have to lead by example to comply with the law.

Silhouettes of laptop users are seen next to a screen projection of Facebook logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The case, taken in Ireland by privacy activist Max Schrems, is the latest to question whether methods used by technology firms such as Google and Apple to transfer data outside the 28-nation European Union give EU consumers sufficient protection from U.S. surveillance.  A ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) against the legal arrangements could cause major headaches for thousands of firms, which make millions of these transfers every day.  The Irish High Court this month ordered the case to be referred to the EU\u2019s top court to assess whether the methods used for data transfers - including standard contractual clauses and the Privacy Shield agreement - were legal.  A Facebook lawyer asked for the referral to be delayed to allow Ireland\u2019s Supreme Court to decide if it would accept an appeal. Facebook would seek an accelerated referral to the Supreme Court so that it would take days not months to decide on whether to allow an appeal, said lawyer Paul Gallagher.  Gallagher said one of the grounds for appeal was the question of whether the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, to be implemented from May 25, would render the case moot or irrelevant.  A lawyer for Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commissioner, said there was no precedent in Ireland for such an appeal and said such a move would simply delay a question, which is of \u201chuge urgency\u201d for people across the EU.  \u201cMillions of people\u2019s data are being transferred and are potentially being adversely impacted by the lesser protections in the United States,\u201d the lawyer, Michael Collins said.  Sean O\u2019Sullivan, representing Schrems, said his client like millions of other Europeans, faced potential \u201ccontinued unlawful processing of his data\u201d if the Irish appeal was to go ahead.  The case was taken in Ireland, the location of Facebook\u2019s headquarters for most of its markets outside the United States.  The judge earlier said the case raised well-founded concerns that there was an absence of an effective remedy in U.S. law compatible with EU legal requirements.

In Minneapolis, a federal government building incurred minor property damage, a U.S. Post Office was destroyed by fire, and another U.S. was severely damaged by fire in the first few days ( here ). There were no reported deaths.  On May 29, a federal officer named Patrick Underwood was shot and killed in Oakland, Calif., while guarding the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building. However, the two men charged in the killing were not supporters of Black Lives Matter or ANTIFA but rather the militant anti-government \u201cboogaloo\u201d movement ( here ).

Clashes between federal agents and demonstrators escalated ( here ).  On July 11, Portland police said ( here ) that a man had been arrested for assaulting a federal agent at the courthouse with a hammer. The same day, a U.S. Marshal severely injured a protester by firing an impact munition used for riot control at his head, according to local ABC News affiliate KATU ( here ). The following weekend, footage showing federal officers beating 53-year-old Navy veteran Christopher David with batons went viral ( here ).  By the end of the month, state troopers had taken over from federal agents guarding the courthouse ( here ).  Other federal buildings damaged amid civil unrest include two federal buildings in Los Angeles on July 25 ( here ) and a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Atlanta on the same day ( here ). There were no reported injuries in either of these cases.  The claim that Democrats are \u201ccheering on\u201d damage to federal buildings or other properties is false. As reported here by The Hill on Aug. 29, Democrats have sought to show support for the causes behind anti-racism protests while opposing violence.

But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not\u201d ( here ).

On June 2, 1997, a federal jury found McVeigh guilty on 11 counts of conspiracy and murder ( here ) and sentenced him to die 11 days later ( here ). He was executed by lethal injection on July 11, 2001 ( here ).  On Dec. 24, 1997, a federal jury found McVeigh\u2019s codefendant Terry Nichols guilty on one count of conspiracy and eight counts of involuntary manslaughter ( here ). Nichols received a life sentence without parole on June 4, 1998 ( here ) and in the 2004 state trial, he was convicted of 161 counts of murder and received 161 consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole ( here ).

There are several factors that can explain this. Antibodies are often developed at any time between one and three weeks after infection (here, here), but can sometimes take between eight and ten weeks to be picked up (here), or may never be detected at all (here, here).

However, previous testing for other viruses by the same means has shown evidence of some false positives (here) .  A recent study of antibody tests on people being treated in hospital found detectability varied depending on the time the test was taken. It also noted more research needed to be carried out on people outside of hospital settings \u2013 and therefore those with milder cases of the illness (here) .  VERDICT  Misleading. These screenshots do not present evidence that the new coronavirus is a lie. Testing positive for coronavirus does not immediately mean your close contacts will be infected.

The network will have a design capacity of up to 150 terabytes per second (Tbps) on key parts of the system, the site said. The 11 new cables rolled out between 2009 and 2016 in sub-Saharan Africa provided around 70 Tbps of design capacity.

The people behind the attack were a group of Facebook and Instagram spammers that present themselves as a digital marketing company, and whose activities were previously known to Facebook\u2019s security team, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the company's internal investigation. on.wsj.com\/2OvMarh  Last week, Facebook said that cyber attackers had stolen data from 29 million Facebook accounts using an automated program that moved from one friend to the next, adding that the data theft had hit fewer than the 50 million profiles it initially reported.  Facebook said in an email to Reuters that it was cooperating with the Federal Bureau of Investigation on this matter.  The breach has left users more vulnerable to targeted phishing attacks and could deepen unease about posting to a service whose privacy, moderation and security practices have been called into question by a number of scandals, cyber security experts and financial analysts have said.  Facebook first disclosed the breach in late September and said it had fixed the issue soon after discovering it on Sept. 25.  Facebook said it was conducting an internal investigation into the incident and last week cut the number of affected users from its original estimate after investigators reviewed activity on accounts that may have been affected.  It had also notified the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, Congressional aides and the Data Protection Commission in Ireland, where the company has European headquarters.","1650":"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland\u2019s data regulator defended its provisional order to halt Facebook user data transfers to the United States from the European Union, telling the Irish High Court on Thursday such decisions were not typically subject to court oversight.

REUTERS\/Clodagh Kilcoyne\/File Photo  Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission, the EU\u2019s lead regulator for Facebook, issued the order in August after Europe\u2019s highest court ruled that a transatlantic data transfer framework known as Privacy Shield was invalid.  Facebook called for a judicial review of the commission\u2019s decision and in September Ireland\u2019s High Court temporarily froze the order to allow such a review, which began on Tuesday.  The EU is concerned that the surveillance regime in the United States may not respect the privacy rights of EU citizens once their personal data is sent there for commercial use.  Facebook told the High Court this week that the EU Court of Justice ruling on Privacy Shield in July alone did not justify a halt to transatlantic data flows, which it says would lead to \u201cdevastating\u201d consequences for its business.  It also said the Irish regulator had failed to hold a full investigation into transatlantic data flows and had not given it enough time to respond.  A lawyer for the Irish regulator said on Thursday that the decision to halt flows had been based in part on findings by the European Court and the Irish Supreme Court as well as its own investigations prior to the July ruling.  \u201cThere is simply nothing in the point that there is some fatal absence of investigation prior to the draft decision being published,\u201d Michael Collins told the court.  Collins rejected the Facebook argument that the evidence considered by the Irish and EU courts was out of date, saying Facebook had not offered any evidence that the legal situation in the United States had changed in the meantime.  The European court decision indicated that a legal mechanism used by Facebook for transfers, the Standard Contractual Clause, was legal but not sufficient to demonstrate user data would be protected, without additional safeguards, Collins said.  He said Facebook was obliged to publish on its web site any additional safeguards it has put in place to defend the data privacy of EU users but had not done so.  The Irish regulator \u201cwas entitled to conclude that ... there doesn\u2019t appear to be any such additional safeguards\u201d, he said.  \u201cCourts generally don\u2019t entertain judicial review challenges to provisional decisions,\u201d Collins said, noting that the regulator had given Facebook 21 days to respond.

(Reporting by Andy Bruce; editing by John Stonestreet)","1652":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook Inc quickly rejected a call from co-founder Chris Hughes on Thursday to split the world\u2019s largest social media company in three, while lawmakers urged the U.S. Justice Department to launch an antitrust investigation.  Facebook has been under scrutiny from regulators around the world over data sharing practices as well as hate speech and misinformation on its networks. Some U.S. lawmakers have pushed for action to break up big tech companies as well as federal privacy regulation.  \u201cWe are a nation with a tradition of reining in monopolies, no matter how well intentioned the leaders of these companies may be. Mark\u2019s power is unprecedented and un-American,\u201d Hughes, a former college roommate of Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, wrote in a lengthy New York Times opinion piece.  Facebook\u2019s social network has more than 2 billion users. It also owns WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, each used by more than 1 billion people. Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.  Facebook rejected Hughes\u2019 call for WhatsApp and Instagram to be made into separate companies, and said the focus should instead be on regulating the internet. Zuckerberg will be in Paris on Friday to discuss internet regulation with French President Emmanuel Macron.  \u201cFacebook accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don\u2019t enforce accountability by calling for the break up of a successful American company,\u201d Facebook spokesman Nick Clegg said in a statement.  \u201cAccountability of tech companies can only be achieved through the painstaking introduction of new rules for the internet. That is exactly what Mark Zuckerberg has called for.\u201d  Late on Thursday, Senator Mike Crapo, the Republican who chairs the banking committee and Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat, asked Facebook to answer questions about a potential cryptocurrency-based payments system using its social network and its data collection.  The letter also asked questions about consumer privacy protections and if it had information about users\u2019 creditworthiness.  U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, told CNBC he thinks Facebook should be broken up and that the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division needs to begin an investigation.  Antitrust law makes such a proposal tough to execute because the government would have to take the company to court and win. It is rare to break up a company but not unheard of, with Standard Oil and AT&T being the two biggest examples.  SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY  Hughes co-founded Facebook in 2004 at Harvard with Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. He left Facebook in 2007, and has said in a LinkedIn post he made half a billion dollars for his three years of work.  \u201cIt\u2019s been 15 years since I co-founded Facebook at Harvard, and I haven\u2019t worked at the company in a decade. But I feel a sense of anger and responsibility,\u201d Hughes said.  Facebook lost several executives after a bruising series of privacy and disinformation scandals since 2016. The founders of Instagram and WhatsApp have left, as has the executive who took over WhatsApp last year.  Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, who had been at the company for 13 years and was one of Zuckerberg\u2019s closest lieutenants, stepped down in March around the same time Facebook announced a pivot toward more private messaging.  He later cited \u201cartistic differences\u201d with Zuckerberg as his reason for leaving, without elaborating.  Critics say the company\u2019s pivot to privacy, which will introduce more encrypted communications, will restrict Facebook\u2019s ability to police propaganda, hate speech and other abusive behavior. Cox focused on improving tools to catch banned content in recent years.  Despite its scandals, the company\u2019s core business has proven resilient. Facebook has blown past earnings estimates in the past two quarters and its stock price barely budged in response to Hughes\u2019 opinion piece.  Hughes suggested Zuckerberg should be held responsible for privacy and other lapses at the company, echoing a call earlier this month by Democratic U.S. Senator Ron Wyden to hold the CEO individually liable for \u201crepeated violations\u201d of privacy.  \u201cThe government must hold Mark accountable. For too long, lawmakers have marveled at Facebook\u2019s explosive growth and overlooked their responsibility to ensure that Americans are protected and markets are competitive,\u201d Hughes said.

REUTERS\/Adam Hunger  LAWMAKER PRESSURE  Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election, has vowed to break up Facebook, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google if elected.  \u201cToday\u2019s big tech companies have too much power\u2014over our economy, our society, & our democracy. They\u2019ve bulldozed competition, used our private info for profit, hurt small businesses & stifled innovation. It\u2019s time to #BreakUpBigTech,\u201d Warren said on Twitter on Thursday.  Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, said in a statement he agreed in retrospect that U.S. regulators should not have approved Facebook\u2019s acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp.  \u201cThe way forward is to heavily scrutinize future mergers and to ensure no company has anti-competitive platform privileges,\u201d Khanna said.  In one of a number of scandals to hit the company, Facebook is accused of inappropriately sharing information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.  Facebook has been in advanced talks with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to settle a year-old investigation and said last month it expected to spend between $3 billion and $5 billion.  On Monday, Republican and Democratic U.S. senators criticized reported plans for the settlement, calling on the FTC to impose harsher penalties and more restrictions on Facebook\u2019s business practices.  Hughes said he last met with Zuckerberg in the summer of 2017, several months before the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke.  \u201cMark is a good, kind person. But I\u2019m angry that his focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks,\u201d Hughes said.  Adam Mosseri, Facebook\u2019s previous head of news feed who recently took over Instagram, responded to Hughes on Twitter.  \u201cRegulation is important and necessary, but I\u2019m not convinced breaking us up is the right path. Would love to chat about it if you\u2019re open,\u201d Mosseri said.","1653":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tech companies including Facebook FB.O, Google GOOGL.O and Microsoft MSFT.O on Thursday pledged to improve and standardise annual disclosures around online child exploitation, as they fight off moves to limit encryption.

The coalition, whose companies collectively earn hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue each year, declined to provide more details, including specifics about which metrics would be tracked.  Child welfare advocates say the number of known child sexual abuse images has soared from thousands to tens of millions in recent years, as predators have increasingly used social networks to groom victims and exchange explicit images.  The U.S.-led \u201cFive Eyes\u201d alliance last year threatened to weaken legal protections and called on Facebook to suspend plans to extend end-to-end encryption across its messaging services.  Facebook generated more than 90% of U.S. child sexual abuse reports online last year, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.  U.S. lawmakers introduced the \u201cEARN IT Act,\u201d in March which would require tech companies to follow best practices to \u201cearn\u201d legal immunity from content posted on their platforms.

Since Facebook announced its plans for Libra in June, politicians and regulators around the world have voiced concern about the project, saying it risked upsetting global financial stability, undermining users\u2019 privacy and enabling money laundering.  In the latest warning shot, Denis Beau, first deputy governor of the Bank of France, said the widespread use of such cryptocurrencies was fraught with peril.  \u201cIf they were to take off, they would raise additional issues in terms of competition, policy, financial stability and monetary policy,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview.  \u201cIt\u2019s really important that this is understood and the risks are addressed before any possible rollout.\u201d  The Libra Association, a body set up by Facebook to oversee the project, said on Monday that the cryptocurrency\u2019s launch, planned for June 2020, may be delayed because of regulatory hurdles. The comments came after a quarter of Libra\u2019s initial members, including major payments firms Visa and Mastercard, abandoned the project.  Libra is a so-called stablecoin, differing from most other cryptocurrencies in that it will be backed by a reserve of real-world assets, including bank deposits and short-term government securities.  The structure is intended to foster trust and stabilize the price volatility that plagues cryptocurrencies and renders them impractical for commerce and payments.","1655":"(Reuters) - Total web traffic to Australian news sites dropped by around 13% after Facebook Inc blocked their content on the social media platform this week, according to early data that underscores the outsize impact the U.S. company has on the local market.

The Chartbeat data, which compared both domestic and foreign traffic to around 250 Australian news publishers on Wednesday before the ban to Thursday, provides some of the first tangible evidence of the impact of Facebook\u2019s move.  The social media giant on Wednesday barred users from sharing or reading news from Australian publishers on its platform in protest of a looming law that will force it and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google to pay publishers for content.  Google and Facebook had campaigned together against the laws, which are expected to be passed by parliament within days, and both threatened to cancel services in Australia. Google, however, sealed pre-emptive deals with several media outlets in recent days.  Total traffic to the Australian news sites from various platforms used outside the country fell by about 30%, the Chartbeat data showed.  Chartbeat said that the percentage of traffic in Australia to the news sites from Google Search rose from around 26% on the day before the ban to about 34% afterward, while traffic from Facebook fell from around 21% to about 2%.  The analytics firm said that it counts Australian Broadcasting Corp and Australian Community Media among the publishers it works with, but could not say if any specific publishers were included in this data.  The Chartbeat data also found that the percentage of traffic to news sites coming from Facebook outside of Australia fell from around 30% to about 4%, while Google Search grew from around 38% to about 52%.  The Chartbeat spokeswoman said foreign readership of Australian news sites is driven heavily by Facebook, with historical data showing around 15% of visits to Australian publishers being driven by Facebook compared to 12% of visits to publishers globally.

The hackers, known as OceanLotus or APT32, have been accused for years of spying on political dissidents, businesses and foreign officials. Reuters reported this year that the group had attempted to break into China\u2019s Ministry of Emergency Management and the government of Wuhan as the COVID-19 outbreak first spread.  Facebook said it had found links between cyberattacks previously attributed to OceanLotus and a Vietnamese company called CyberOne Group, which lists an address on a sidestreet in a commercial district of Ho Chi Minh city.  CyberOne Group denied being connected to the hackers.  \u201cWe are NOT Ocean Lotus,\u201d a person operating the company\u2019s now-suspended Facebook page said when contacted by Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake.\u201d  Vietnam\u2019s foreign ministry, which handles enquiries from international media, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The ministry has previously denied connections to OceanLotus attacks.  Facebook said the hackers had used its platforms to carry out a range of cyberattacks, some of which employed fake accounts to trick targets by posing as activists, businesses and possible love interests.  Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy, said his team had found technical evidence that linked CyberOne\u2019s Facebook page to accounts used in the hacking campaign, as well as to other OceanLotus attacks.  He declined to detail the exact evidence, saying to do so would make the group more difficult to track in the future. But he said it included online infrastructure, malicious code, and other hacking tools and techniques.  \u201cThe actors in this space use some very defined techniques and if we are too public about how we observe those, it really does harm our ability to catch more of this,\u201d Gleicher said.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook\u2019s escalated a bruising fight with TikTok with the launch on Wednesday of its new short-video feature Reels, a look-alike service embedded within its popular Instagram app.  The debut arrived at a fraught moment for TikTok, which has come under threat of a ban by the White House, prompting China\u2019s ByteDance to weigh a sale of the app\u2019s U.S. operations to Microsoft.  Here is a look at the tense tangle between heavyweight Facebook and upstart TikTok.  * Before China\u2019s ByteDance acquired Shanghai-based startup Musical.ly in 2017 and turned it into TikTok, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg tried to buy the app, BuzzFeed has reported. A source familiar with the effort confirmed the talks to Reuters. Discussions ultimately stalled, and by 2018 Facebook executives believed TikTok was not retaining U.S. users long-term, another source said.  * In mid-2018, ByteDance began an aggressive push aimed at growing TikTok\u2019s U.S. footprint, surging app-install ads on Facebook\u2019s ad network. At the peak, it was responsible for nearly 22% of all such ads on U.S. Apple devices, according to data from Sensor Tower. It cut back drastically in 2019 once TikTok gained a teenage following and shifted to building an ads business to compete against Facebook.  * As Facebook came under pressure in Washington, it pushed back on calls to regulate U.S. tech companies by invoking the specter of an internet dominated by Chinese firms. Zuckerberg warned in a speech last year that China was \u201cexporting their vision of the internet to other countries.\u201d The U.S. government initiated a national security review of Utterance\u2019s Musical.ly acquisition late last year, after lawmakers expressed concerns around data security and censorship.  * With the launch of Reels, Facebook is offering similar functionality to TikTok from within Instagram, which already boasts vast user numbers. The company recruited young TikTok stars to use the new service ahead of its launch, offering to cover production costs. In a blog post, TikTok\u2019s chief executive dismissed Reels as a \u201ccopycat product\u201d and slammed Facebook for its \u201cmaligning attacks ... disguised as patriotism.\u201d","1662":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc\u2019s shares lost as much as a quarter of their value on Wednesday after executives said that profit margins would plummet for several years due to the costs of improving privacy safeguards and slowing usage in the biggest advertising markets.  The second-quarter results were the first sign that a new European privacy law and a succession of privacy scandals involving Cambridge Analytica and other app developers have bit into Facebook\u2019s business. The company further warned that the toll would not be offset by revenue growth from emerging markets and Facebook\u2019s Instagram app, which has been more immune from privacy concerns.  Facebook's fortunes shifted in under two hours as the company first reported revenue and user growth that missed expectations and then issued warnings about future growth and expenses. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/2JV9APu)  Operating profit margin, which fell to 44 percent in the second quarter from 47 percent a year ago, will sink to the \u201cmid-30s\u201d for more than two years, Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said in investor guidance.  The plummeting stock price wiped out as much as $150 billion in market capitalization and erased the stock\u2019s gains since April when Facebook announced a surprisingly strong 63 percent rise in profit and an increase in users.  If the share drop holds on Thursday, it would be Facebook\u2019s largest single-day decline, topping a 12 percent decrease in July 2012.  Nasdaq futures dropped 0.85 percent late on Wednesday, suggesting the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index would fall when trading opens on Thursday morning. Facebook\u2019s results prompted selling in other Nasdaq listings, including media and advertising rivals Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc and Alphabet Inc.  \u2018ENTERING A NEW PERIOD\u2019  Facebook had cautioned investors to expect a big jump in second-quarter costs because of efforts to address concerns about poor handling of users\u2019 privacy and to better monitor what users post. Total expenses in the second quarter surged to $7.4 billion, up 50 percent compared with a year ago.  Facebook forecast similar increases for the second half of the year, also citing spending on video content and marketing.  Its gloomy forecast for revenue growth surprised investors, though, and prompted many questions from financial analysts on a conference call with company executives on Wednesday.  Sales in the second quarter grew 42 percent, its slowest pace in nearly three years, to $13.2 billion compared with $9.3 billion a year ago.  Wehner said quarterly revenue growth would be closer to 30 percent the rest of the year.  He cited currency fluctuations and a shift in usage to features where Facebook shows less advertising or charges less due to lower demand.  The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union also will cause a revenue drop. The new privacy law forced several changes to Facebook\u2019s privacy terms and sign-up process, leading a minority of users to opt for non-personalized ads, which tend to generate less revenue.  \u201cThey\u2019re talking about currency headwinds, but more we think it\u2019s due to slower user growth given GDPR and more focus on privacy,\u201d Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi said.  Facebook\u2019s daily active users in Europe declined by 3 million amid the new regulation. Worldwide daily user growth for Facebook\u2019s namesake service slid for its sixth straight quarter, bringing it to nearly 1.5 billion users in the second quarter.

REUTERS\/Eric Gaillard\/File photo  The company said for the first time that more than 2.5 billion users interact with at least one of its apps each month, but analysts have said many of them are spending more time with Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram. Commercialization of those apps is nascent.  Revenue from emerging markets has not picked up the slack either. Sales from United States, Canada and Europe fell $75 million in the second quarter compared with a year ago, while revenue from other markets rose $51 million.  Gene Munster, a venture capitalist at Loup Ventures, said in an email that Facebook is \u201centering a new period\u201d where declining user growth will translate to slower revenue growth.  He added that Facebook has \u201ca track record of resetting revenue growth and expense expectations only to turn around and exceed those expectations the following quarter.\u201d  Facebook reported $5.1 billion in profit, or $1.74 per share, compared with the average estimates of $5.1 billion and $1.72 per share among research gathered by Thomson Reuters.  The threat of additional privacy regulatory setbacks remains a concern, according to analysts.  Facebook suffered a blow in China on Wednesday when regulators there withdrew their approval of a company innovation hub to support local startups, the New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing a person familiar with the matter.  Misinformation on WhatsApp contributing to mob killings in India have added to the pressure on Facebook to re-evaluate how its services maintain security and decorum.  Nearly all social media services have received greater scrutiny since U.S. intelligence agencies in January 2017 revealed that organizations tied to the Russian government had seeded content on the platform to shake up the 2016 U.S. presidential election."}}
