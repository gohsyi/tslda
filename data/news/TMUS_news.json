REUTERS\/Steve Marcus  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors are investigating Huawei Technologies[HWT.UL], the world\u2019s largest telecommunications equipment maker, for allegedly stealing trade secrets from U.S. businesses and could soon issue an indictment, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.  Citing people familiar with the matter, the Journal said that one area of investigation is the technology behind a device that T-Mobile U.S. Inc TMUS.O used for testing smartphones. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report.  The action is the latest in a long list taken to fight what some in the Trump administration call China\u2019s cheating through intellectual property theft, illegal corporate subsidies and rules hampering U.S. corporations that want to sell their goods in China.  The investigation arose out of civil lawsuits against Huawei, the Journal said, including one in Seattle where Huawei was found liable for misappropriating robotic technology from T-Mobile TMUS.O.  A Huawei spokesman and a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney in the western district of Washington declined comment.  T-Mobile alleged in a 2014 lawsuit, filed in federal court in Seattle, that Huawei employees stole technology relating to a smartphone-testing robot T-Mobile had in a lab in Bellevue, Washington.  The robot, Tappy, used human-like fingers to simulate tapping on mobile phones.  According to T-Mobile\u2019s lawsuit, Huawei employees photographed the robot and attempted to remove one of its parts.  In May 2017, a jury said Huawei should pay T-Mobile $4.8 million in damages.","4":"(Reuters) - U.S. wireless carrier T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.O, which is buying smaller rival Sprint Corp S.N, topped Wall Street estimates for revenue on Tuesday as it added more phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill.  A sign for a T-Mobile store is seen in Manhattan, New York, U.S., April 30, 2018. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  T-Mobile and Sprint announced on Sunday they had agreed to an all-stock $26 billion deal, which the companies say they expect will hold up against regulatory scrutiny because it will create thousands of American jobs and better prepare them to create the next-generation wireless network.  T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere said during the post-earnings conference call with analysts that he had meetings with the Securities Exchange Commission on Tuesday that went \u201cextremely well,\u201d and added he would respect the regulatory review process.  Shares of the company rose 2 percent in after-market trading on Tuesday.  T-Mobile added 617,000 phone subscribers who pay a bill in the quarter ended March 31, down from an addition of 798,000 subscribers a year earlier.  The company attributed the decline partly due to the late arrival during the quarter of the Samsung Galaxy S9, since new smartphone launches have historically driven new customer additions.  Connected devices like the Apple AAPL.O Watch helped raise postpaid net customer additions, and T-Mobile President Mike Stewart called the Apple Watch \"a nice surprise hit\" during the earnings call.  The company\u2019s revenue rose to $10.46 billion from $9.61 billion, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $10.35 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Net income fell to $671 million, or 78 cents a share, during the quarter, down 4 percent from $698 million, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier.  Analysts had expected net income of 71 cents per share.  A deal between T-Mobile and Sprint will help T-Mobile boost its financials by creating a company with 127 million customers, making it a more formidable competitor to the top two wireless players, Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N and AT&T Inc T.N.  Macquarie analyst Amy Yong said in a research note that the coming regulatory decision on the proposed AT&T-Time Warner merger could affect approval for the T-Mobile and Sprint tie-up.  Both carriers\u2019 foreign ownership could also complicate the approval process, Yong wrote.","5":"Representation of the Bitcoin virtual currency standing on the PC motherboard is seen in this illustration picture, February 3, 2018.

The deal to combine the No. 3 and No. 4 U.S. wireless carriers, struck in April, was approved by both companies\u2019 shareholders in October and has received national security clearance, but still needs approval from the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission.  Unions, consumer advocates, rural operators and some lawmakers have criticized the deal, saying it will cause job losses and lead to higher prices.  Legere and Sprint executive chairman Marcelo Claure are set to testify to a House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee panel on Wednesday. A Judiciary Committee panel will also hear from the executives although the date is uncertain.  Rural operators are some of Legere\u2019s fiercest critics. Carri Bennet, general counsel at the Rural Wireless Association, said in written testimony the merger \u201cwill force rural Americans to pay more money for wireless services,\u201d especially if they contract with a mobile virtual network operator who buys wholesale access to Sprint\u2019s network and re-sells it.  She said that Sprint is the only one of the four national carriers that offers anything approximating commercially reasonable roaming rates to rural carriers. \u201cIt (the merger) should be denied,\u201d she said.  In the U.S. wireless market, the industry leaders are AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc.  A group of eight Democratic U.S. senators and independent Senator Bernie Sanders urged the Justice Department and FCC on Tuesday to reject the deal, saying it is \u201clikely to raise prices for consumers, harm workers, stifle competition, exacerbate the digital divide, and undermine innovation.\u201d  They said monthly bills could rise as much as 10 percent, and noted the Communications Workers of America union has said a merger would hurt wages and destroy as many as 30,000 jobs.  Lawmakers who signed the letter include potential or confirmed presidential candidates Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Sherrod Brown, Kirsten Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker.  Consumer advocates have said that since Sprint and T-Mobile have a big market share in prepaid plans favored by the poorest wireless customers, they were likely to be disproportionately hurt by the deal.  To win the government\u2019s support, T-Mobile previously said that it would not increase prices for three years.  In his prepared remarks released on Tuesday, Legere pointed to his company\u2019s history of aggressive pricing, said it would need 11,000 new employees by 2024 and pledged to compete hard on building the next generation of wireless, called 5G.  Legere also pledged to create 5G without using networking equipment from Huawei or ZTE, two Chinese telecommunications giants distrusted by U.S. national security experts.

In a letter to the FCC, T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere asked the government to move forward \u201cexpeditiously\u201d in reviewing the merger of the No. 3 and No. 4 wireless carriers, and attempted to allay fears the deal would mean higher prices.  \u201cWhile we are combining our networks over the next three years, T-Mobile today is submitting to the commission a commitment that I stand behind -- a commitment that New T-Mobile will make available the same or better rate plans for our services as those offered today by T-Mobile or Sprint,\u201d Legere wrote in the letter.  Consumer advocates have said that since Sprint and T-Mobile have a big market share in prepaid plans favored by the poorest wireless customers, they were likely to be disproportionately hurt by the planned deal.  The pledge comes a week before two committees in the House of Representatives -- Energy and Commerce and Judiciary -- hold a joint hearing to discuss the transaction. The hearing is set for Feb. 13, and both Legere and Sprint Chairman Marcelo Claure have agreed to testify.  In a separate government filing, T-Mobile noted that while it would attempt to fend off price increases it may have to adjust rates to pass through costs like taxes or third-party fees that \u201care not within the control of New T-Mobile.\u201d  The companies have also pledged to build customer care centers that will create up to 5,600 jobs and have said that they expected the merger to create more than 12,000 jobs to serve small towns and rural communities.  The proposed merger has won approval from a national security panel headed by the Treasury Department. It is undergoing an antitrust review by the Justice Department and the FCC must decide that the transaction is in the public interest.","8":"WASHINGTON, Nov 4 (Reuters) - T-Mobile will pay a $200 million penalty to resolve a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) investigation into its subsidiary Sprint for failing to comply with rules on a low-income subsidy program, the government said Wednesday.

REUTERS\/Issei Kato  (Reuters) - U.S. wireless carrier T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.O said it has priced a sale of its shares at $103 each in a deal that will see SoftBank Group 9984.T divest a portion of its stake - a major step in the Japanese conglomerate's plan to sell assets.  The pricing comes after SoftBank unveiled a series of transactions on Monday to divest more than $20 billion of stock in T-Mobile, as it seeks funding for a $41 billion share buybacks and debt reduction plan.  The sale price is a 4% discount to T-Mobile\u2019s Tuesday closing price.  Together with SoftBank's already announced monetisation of stakes in e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding BABA.N and wireless carrier Softbank Corp 9434.T, \"we now believe the selling is complete,\" Sanford C.

The deal would allow SoftBank Group, which reports its earnings after market close on Wednesday, offload a troubled asset at a time when its other major bets face investor scepticism.  The jump in SoftBank Group pushed up the information and communication sector sub-index 2.4%, making it the best-performing sector on the Tokyo bourse.

No.3 U.S. mobile carrier T-Mobile - which in April agreed to a merger with Sprint S.N to create a more formidable rival to U.S. telecom giants Verizon VZ.N and AT&T T.N - said the multiyear supply deal with Nokia will deliver the first nationwide 5G services.  The T-Mobile award is critical to Finland\u2019s Nokia, whose results have been battered by years of slowing demand for existing 4G networks and mounting investor doubts over whether 5G contracts can begin to boost profitability later this year.  5G networks promise to deliver faster speeds for mobile phone users and make networks more responsive and reliable for the eventual development of new industrial automation, medical monitoring, driverless car and other business uses.  But cash-strapped telecom operators around the world have been gun-shy over committing to commercial upgrades of existing networks, with many seeing 5G technology simply as a way to deliver incremental capacity increases instead of new features.  Terms of the deal call for Nokia to supply a range of 5G hardware, software and services that will allow T-Mobile to capitalize on licensed airwave to deliver, broad coverage on 600 megahertz spectrum and ultra high-speed capacity on 28 gigahertz airwaves in densely trafficked urban areas, the companies said.  Nokia will supply T-Mobile with its AirScale radio access platform along with cloud-connected hardware, software and acceleration services, they said in a statement.

The merger between the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers was agreed in April 2018, but was prevented from closing by U.S. states challenging it in court on antitrust grounds. A U.S. federal judge gave the companies the green light Tuesday to complete the deal.  Before it is completed, T-Mobile\u2019s German parent, Deutsche Telekom AG, plans to ask Sprint\u2019s majority owner, Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group, to agree to a lower price, arguing that Sprint\u2019s fortunes have deteriorated following their agreement two years ago, sources told Reuters on Monday.  However, investors are pricing in only a modest potential haircut. Sprint shares were trading at around $8.3 on Tuesday, a 14% discount to the $9.6 per share price that the all-stock deal with T-Mobile assigns Sprint.  The market is assuming an approximately 9% cut to the deal price, Cowen analysts wrote in a research note on Monday after the companies\u2019 shares soared on news that the merger could go ahead.  T-Mobile has plenty of arguments it can deploy in a renegotiation with Sprint. The latter\u2019s market share in subscribing phone customers is down from 12.4% at the start of 2018 to 11.8% in the third quarter of 2019, according to Cowen analysts, as it shed 400,000 customers. Meanwhile, its debt pile rose from $33 billion to $34.1 billion.  SoftBank\u2019s prospects have also worsened, making it harder for it to walk away from a deal. The Japanese conglomerate is struggling to raise money from investors for its second $100 billion Vision Fund, as high-profile bets on start-ups such as WeWork backfired.  Nevertheless, T-Mobile will likely be mindful about jeopardizing the deal with Sprint, because it needs the merger to take on bigger rivals Verizon Communications and AT&T in the race for the development of next-generation wireless 5G technology, analysts said.  \u201cThe only credible fallback is if T-Mobile says they\u2019re willing to walk away, and I don\u2019t think anyone would take them seriously,\u201d said Craig Moffett, a telecom analyst at MoffettNathanson.  The merger would form a wireless giant with 126 million customers and help T-Mobile in the race for 5G by utilizing Sprint\u2019s valuable spectrum. It would also allow T-Mobile to save on costs by eliminating overlapping infrastructure.  Despite the decline in its business, the valuation of Sprint\u2019s 2.5 GHz spectrum, a prime band for 5G deployment, has doubled to $25 billion from 2016 to 2019, analysts at JPMorgan estimate. Both Verizon and T-Mobile are short on spectrum amid growing usage, according to New Street Research analysts.  \u201cThe primary leverage Sprint has is that T-Mobile\u2019s growth and pending launch of 5G makes that spectrum depth very important to T-Mobile,\u201d said Walt Piecyk, an analyst at LightShed Partners. \u201cI would not be shocked if there was no change in price, because it\u2019s been such a lengthy process, and the demand for spectrum continues to rise.\u201d  T-Mobile said on Tuesday it expects the deal to close by April 1. Its executives have maintained on previous earnings calls the company hoped to close the deal in early 2020.  \u201cA renegotiation won\u2019t be easy, and by far the most important objective for both sides will be to close and move on to integrating,\u201d said Jonathan Chaplin, analyst at New Street Research.","23":"A federal appeals court on Tuesday revived a lawsuit in which patent licensing company Intellectual Ventures accused T-Mobile US Inc and Sweden\u2019s Ericsson of infringing a patent for allocating bandwidth resources.

T-Mobile has 38 percent of the U.S. pre-paid market, while Sprint has 16 percent, which would give the combined company 54 percent, according to S&P.  \u201cLower income consumers are likely to lose the most options and face stiff price hikes because Sprint and T-Mobile are the only game in town for them,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, president of advocacy group Public Knowledge and a former chief counsel for the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division.  In its antitrust review, the Justice Department would likely view the prepaid market as a separate market, and if they do the companies could be in for a tough review, experts said.  \u201cIt\u2019s clearly putting a more than 50 percent leader in the market. That will draw serious scrutiny,\u201d said Caroline Holland, a Mozilla tech policy fellow who formerly served as chief counsel for competition and intergovernmental relations in DOJ\u2019s antitrust division.  Sprint Chief Executive Marcelo Claure told Reuters during a post-earnings call with reporters that customers will benefit from the stronger network of a combined Sprint and T-Mobile, and pricing will improve because of the network\u2019s increased capacity.  \u201cYou\u2019ll see this company be the best in pre-paid and post-paid,\u201d Claure said, adding that by creating a better network, it will make the industry more competitive. \u201cI think we have everything we need to lower prices and also grow market share.\u201d  Consumers are already questioning the fewer choices among the major carriers. Sharron Cannon, 60, who lives in Harlem, New York, said she had canceled her Sprint plan because she was unhappy with the service and moved to T-Mobile, only to find out the companies were combining.

AT&T and Verizon declined comment.  WHOLESALE WOES  T-Mobile and Sprint sell their airwaves to smaller wireless carriers that also serve low-income and budget-conscious customers, and a merger could hurt those carriers\u2019 ability to negotiate for lower prices, said Stephen Stokols, chief executive of FreedomPop, which offers a free phone plan and uses Sprint\u2019s network.  Retail wireless prices have declined over the past year and a half, but Stokols predicts price cuts will end after the merger.  FreedomPop has more than 2 million customers, and about 20 percent make less than $40,000 per year, Stokols said, adding about half of users are on the free phone service plan.  Since T-Mobile and Sprint have their own branded pre-paid users, and also power smaller pre-paid operators, the control the company would have over the market is concerning, Stokols said.  The deal is \u201cgood for the market, but bad for consumers,\u201d Stokols said. \u201cT-Mobile and Sprint have been driving down pricing previously. you won\u2019t have competition at the bottom level anymore.\u201d","25":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Executives from T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp faced tough questions from lawmakers on Wednesday about how the companies\u2019 planned merger would affect prices and jobs, especially in rural America.  The deal to combine the No. 3 and No. 4 U.S. wireless carriers, struck in April, was approved by both companies\u2019 shareholders in October and has received national security clearance, but still needs approval from the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission.  Representative Mike Doyle, who chairs the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee panel holding the hearing, raised worries about the deal because the U.S. wireless market has just four main carriers. The industry leaders are AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of one (deal) where consolidation did not result in people losing their jobs, prices going up and innovation being stifled,\u201d Doyle said.  Representative Billy Long, a Republican, expressed concern about lost jobs in his Missouri district. Representative Dave Loebsack, a Democrat, pointed to job losses in Iowa after T-Mobile\u2019s acquisition of Iowa Wireless last year and said T-Mobile\u2019s plan to buy Sprint made him \u201cvery concerned\u201d about potential negative effects on Iowa.  Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said T-Mobile had sent call center jobs overseas in 2012 and asked for legally enforceable assurances that the new jobs touted by T-Mobile US Chief Executive John Legere would not be sent offshore once the deal wins approval.  Legere defended the $26 billion deal, arguing that it will create jobs and help with the construction of the next generation of wireless networks. He said the merged company would have more capacity which would lead to a push to lower prices.  Slideshow ( 7 images )  \u201cThis is a unique merger in that there will be a significant increase in supply,\u201d Legere said. To win support for the deal, T-Mobile previously said it would not increase prices for three years.  Legere was not without supporters. Representatives Anna Eshoo, a Democrat, and Steve Scalise, a Republican, asked questions that indicated support for the deal.  In prepared remarks released on Tuesday, Legere pointed to the company\u2019s history of aggressive pricing, said it would need 11,000 new employees by 2024 and pledged to compete hard on building the next generation of wireless, called 5G.  He also pledged to create 5G without using networking equipment from Huawei Technologies Co Ltd or ZTE Corp, two Chinese telecommunications firms distrusted by U.S. national security experts.  T-Mobile has run into criticism from unions and consumer advocates, but rural operators have been the fiercest opponents.  Carri Bennet, general counsel at the Rural Wireless Association, said the merger \u201cwill force rural Americans to pay more money for wireless services,\u201d especially if they contract with a mobile virtual network operator who buys wholesale access to Sprint\u2019s network and re-sells it.  Slideshow ( 7 images )  She said that Sprint is the only one of the four national carriers that offers anything approximating commercially reasonable roaming rates to rural carriers. \u201cIt (the merger) should be denied,\u201d she said.  Communications Workers of America President Chris Shelton told the committee the deal would \u201ckill American jobs, lower wages, and raise prices.\u201d  Consumer advocates have said that the poorest wireless customers were likely to be disproportionately hurt by the deal since Sprint and T-Mobile have a big market share in prepaid plans.

The $26 billion deal between the two U.S. wireless carriers, which would shrink the wireless market to three big players from four, faces a review from the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission.  In the filing with the FCC, Altice said it was opposed to the merger and called for the regulator to put conditions on the deal, including requiring the combined T-Mobile to honor its partnerships with Altice and other companies that rely on its network, and even divest wireless spectrum that the companies can use.  Altice plans to resell Sprint\u2019s wireless service under its own brand next year, but is limited to selling its phone plans in the cable provider\u2019s current markets.  While that agreement still stands, Altice said it was concerned about T-Mobile\u2019s willingness to allow Altice to expand its wireless service nationwide and over the long term, since the carrier has made \u201cno tangible commitments\u201d to do so.  T-Mobile and Sprint have previously cited cable companies such as Comcast Corp and Charter Communications Inc , which are entering the wireless industry, as growing competitors.

T-Mobile, the third biggest U.S. mobile carrier, said on Monday the Nokia deal would help to deliver the first nationwide 5G services in the United States, where T-Mobile in April agreed to a merger with Sprint to create a more formidable rival to U.S. telecom giants Verizon and AT&T.  The T-Mobile award is critical to Nokia, whose results have been battered by years of slowing demand for existing 4G networks and mounting investor doubts over whether 5G contracts can begin to boost profitability later this year.  \u201cThis is our largest 5G deal to date, in fact it\u2019s one of our largest-ever deals,\u201d Phil Twist, Nokia\u2019s global marketing chief said in interview. \u201cThis is reinforcing the fact that we see 5G accelerating to market in Q3 and ramping up in Q4.\u201d  5G networks promise to deliver faster speeds for mobile phone users and make networks more responsive and reliable for the eventual development of new industrial automation, medical monitoring, driverless car and other business uses.  But cash-strapped telecom operators around the world have been shy of committing to commercial upgrades of existing networks, with many seeing 5G technology simply as a way to deliver incremental capacity increases instead of new features.  Terms of the new deal call for Nokia to supply a range of 5G hardware, software and services that will allow T-Mobile to capitalise on licensed airwave to deliver broad coverage on 600 megahertz spectrum and ultra high-speed capacity on 28 gigahertz airwaves in urban areas with dense traffic, the companies said.  Customers, however, will not notice a discernible difference in terms of faster speeds or other features until the first 5G-ready smartphones go on sale in early 2019. Even then, full-featured, 5G phones are unlikely to go mainstream until at least 2020 for a mix of technical and economic reasons, analysts said.  Nokia said it will supply T-Mobile with its AirScale radio access platform along with cloud-connected hardware, software and acceleration services, the two companies said.  T-Mobile said in February it was working both with Nokia and rival network vendor Ericsson of Sweden to build out 5G networks in 30 U.S. cities during 2018.  Ericsson was not immediately available to comment on where it stood on finalising its own previously announced plans to deliver 5G networks in New York, Los Angeles and Las Vegas.  In first announcing its plans with T-Mobile earlier this year, Nokia had said it was focusing on Dallas and other unnamed \u201cheavily populated areas of the country.\u201d It provided no further details on what cities Monday\u2019s commercial deal might cover.  WAITING FOR 5G  Nokia delivered lower profits in the first two quarters of 2018 but pledged to meet full-year targets as 5G demand begins to take off later this year. The company reiterated its outlook after the T-Mobile deal, saying it was fully calculated into its existing guidance.  Nokia traded up 1.3 percent to 4.76 euros on the Helsinki stock exchange. T-Mobile stock rose more modestly on Nasdaq.  The network equipment business, led by China\u2019s Huawei , Nokia and Ericsson - has struggled with flagging growth since demand for the current generation of 4G mobile equipment peaked in 2015.  Network vendors are counting on rivalry between the four big U.S. mobile carriers to drive initial 5G purchases this year into next. South Korea and Japan are poised to jump in with 5G commercial rollouts in 2019\u2019s first half, followed by the world\u2019s biggest mobile market, China, later next year, with operators in the Middle East to follow from 2020 onwards.  T-Mobile and Sprint, are using 5G to win President Donald Trump\u2019s backing for their merger that will reduce the U.S. mobile market from four players to three.  They argue the combined company is the United States\u2019 best hope for nationwide 5G services, which, in turn, can help the country to maintain technology leadership over China.  T-Mobile has previously projected capital spending on new equipment of around $5 billion for 2018.

T-Mobile, majority-owned by Deutsche Telekom AG DTEGn.DE, and Sprint, controlled by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T, said the combined company would invest $40 billion over the next three years to upgrade networks to accommodate 5G.  The Federal Communications Commission said in February it planned new auctions of high-band spectrum starting later this year to speed the launch of next-generation 5G networks.  Carriers have spent billions of dollars acquiring spectrum and are beginning to develop and test 5G networks, which are expected to be at least 100 times faster than current 4G networks and cut latency, or delays, to less than one-thousandth of a second from one-hundredth of a second in 4G, the FCC has said.  Policymakers and mobile phone companies have said the next generation of wireless signals needs to be much faster and far more responsive to allow advanced technologies like virtual surgery or controlling machines remotely.  Shares for Sprint closed down 3.6 percent, while T-Mobile was off 1.8 percent.  T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere met with two FCC commissioners in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the merits of the deal.

The Justice Department approved the merger in July after the carriers agreed to sell some assets to satellite provider Dish. The merger, however, was still subject to approval by the FCC, which came in October.  Ergen\u2019s testimony on Wednesday came during the trial of a lawsuit filed in June by a group of U.S. states seeking to block the Sprint and T-Mobile merger. The states, led by New York and California, say the merger would lead to higher prices for customers.  The purchase by Englewood, Colorado-based Dish of the Sprint assets would allow Dish to build a viable competitor to the combined T-Mobile\/Sprint, Verizon and AT&T.

Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, head of the department\u2019s Antitrust Division, will announce a significant merger enforcement action on Friday, the Justice Department said.  The expected approval, which would put the deal over a major hurdle, will come with conditions and a consent decree that will require the carriers to sell assets including the prepaid brand Boost Mobile to satellite TV provider Dish Network Corp , people briefed on the matter told Reuters.  Prepaid wireless phones are generally sought by lower-income people who cannot pass a credit check.  Dish will also get first rights to buy tower leases that T-Mobile decides are redundant following the deal, a source said.

T-Mobile has a reputation for aggressively seeking to cut prices and improve service to woo customers away from market leaders Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc, and antitrust enforcers may want to preserve that dynamic.","44":"March 17 (Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc:  * T-MOBILE US INC - FURTHER REDUCING NUMBER OF COMPANY-OWNED RETAIL STORES CO HAS OPEN  * T-MOBILE US INC - STARTING MARCH 17TH, WILL CLOSE ABOUT 80% OF STORE LOCATIONS  * T-MOBILE US INC - CLOSED STORES WILL REMAIN CLOSED UNTIL AT LEAST MARCH 31  * T-MOBILE US INC - REMAINING 20% OF STORES ARE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS COUNTRY AND DESIGNED TO BE WITHIN A 30-MINUTE DRIVE FOR MOST CUSTOMERS  * T-MOBILE US INC - REMAINING 20% OF STORES WILL OPERATE ON REDUCED SCHEDULES  * T-MOBILE US INC - WILL STAFF REMAINING 20% STORES ONLY WITH WORKERS WHO ARE WILLING TO COME IN AND SUPPORT CUSTOMERS  * T-MOBILE US - IMPLEMENTING APPROACH FOR HOURLY RETAIL EMPLOYEES TO MAINTAIN THEIR TARGET INCOME DURING INITIAL CLOSURES THIS MONTH Source text for Eikon: bit.ly\/3be3AQj Further company coverage:","45":"FILE PHOTO: A sign for a T-Mobile store is seen in Manhattan, New York, U.S., April 30, 2018.

The foray by 5-year-old Shenzhen-based OnePlus comes after U.S. mobile carriers AT&T T.N and Verizon VZ.N this year backed away from plans to work with China's Huawei on high-end phones in face of pressure from the U.S. government, which considers Huawei a security risk.  The United States also briefly banned companies from selling goods to ZTE 000063.SZ , which was caught shipping U.S. technology to Iran and North Korea, violating U.S. sanctions.  \u201cGiven the involvement of the Chinese government with other Chinese telecommunications companies, we should always take a close look any time a new Chinese telecommunications supplier tries to enter the domestic market,\u201d said U.S. Senator Mark Warner, in an emailed response to a Reuters question. \u201cThere can be real security concerns here, as we saw with Huawei and ZTE.\u201d  But the OnePlus alliance, announced at an event on Monday in New York, shows how many U.S.-China business relationships, including those involving the most advanced technologies, are marching ahead despite the escalating U.S. China trade war.  T-Mobile said the OnePlus 6T smart phone would launch exclusively at the carrier\u2019s stores on Nov. 1 with a starting price of $549, the first time a OnePlus handset has been sold through a U.S. wireless provider - and a deal that the firm\u2019s larger rivals such as Huawei could not pull off.  While some OnePlus models have been on sale in the United States through e-commerce websites, carrier relationships like the one with T-Mobile are critical because most U.S. consumers still purchase phones through their carriers.  Slideshow ( 14 images )  \u201cI don\u2019t know if it is a good time for anybody else,\u201d Carl Pei, the 29-year-old founder of OnePlus, said of the prospect of entering the U.S. carrier-bundled phone market during an interview with Reuters at an event in Hong Kong last week. \u201cIt is a good time for us.\u201d  In an interview on Monday, Jon Freier, T-mobile\u2019s executive vice president of U.S. retail, said the U.S.-China trade battle played no role in this deal and the carrier has not heard from U.S. regulators. \u201cOnePlus has a sterling reputation, and we\u2019ve researched the device and vetted it thoroughly,\u201d Freier said.  Xiaomi, a Chinese rival that also focuses on feature-packed phones at bargain prices, has said it plans to launch in the United States next year but did not respond to a request for comment on whether those plans are still in place.  OnePlus is unusual among Chinese tech companies, which typically focus on mass-market products for domestic customers. OnePlus, by contrast, only sells premium phones that cost $400 or more and almost exclusively online except in India. It derives two-thirds of its revenue from outside China and is the top seller of premium smartphones in India.  OnePlus is affiliated with OPPO, a Chinese smartphone-maker and a major force in mid-end phones, which are sold globally and cost about $300. The relationship helps OnePlus keep its costs low, said Canalys analyst Mo Jia.  According to Chinese company registration records, the two companies have common shareholders.  Pei shrugged off any concerns that U.S. consumer sentiment would be affected by the China-US trade conflict. \u201cAt the end of the day, all you can control is your own [product].\u201d  Pei, who was born in China and raised in Sweden, said the brand is cross-cultural and international: \u201cWhen we started, we saw that through social media, you can talk to everyone around the world, as long as you can speak their language.\u201d  \u201cIf OnePlus is an independent actor and not under the thumb of the Chinese communist party, we should welcome them to compete in the US market,\u201d Senator Warner said. \u201cBut we need to make sure they are that independent actor and cannot be leveraged by the Chinese government to hurt our national security.\u201d","56":"NEW YORK, Aug 1 (Reuters) - A magistrate judge on the states\u2019 attorneys general fight against the merger of Sprint and T-Mobile US said on Thursday the trial will be delayed to Dec. 9.

Masayoshi Son\u2019s SoftBank Group, which controls Sprint, is taking a modest hit to clinch the $120 billion merger with rival cellphone outfit T-Mobile US. The latter could have pushed harder, but that might have put the long-awaited deal at risk.  The two companies blew past their agreement\u2019s expiry date in November because, even after navigating federal antitrust authorities, various U.S. state regulators unsuccessfully sued to block the deal. That meant they had to renegotiate - and Sprint\u2019s financial performance has deteriorated since the deal was struck almost two years ago.  The rehash recognizes that, effectively reducing the share of the enlarged company \u2013 valued at around $120 billion at the close on Thursday \u2013 that will go to Sprint shareholders. But it is Son\u2019s firm, which owns 84% of Sprint, that is taking the entire haircut leaving independent investors with the same deal they started with. It\u2019s a hit worth about $5 billion at Thursday\u2019s share prices.  Breakingviews has calculated that T-Mobile and Deutsche Telekom, its controlling owner, could have valued Sprint considerably lower than the $37 billion implied by the new terms. But that might have jeopardized the whole deal. Sprint would have had to bring any new terms for minority shareholders to a fresh vote, potentially gumming up the process even further. And SoftBank\u2019s negotiating room was probably limited by its carrying value for the stake in Sprint.  SoftBank has even worked out a clawback. T-Mobile will hand back to the Japanese firm the shares it is giving up if the stock price hits $150 by 2025 - around 50% above where it closed on Thursday.  The end result is T-Mobile finally gets the merger that unites America\u2019s No. 3 and No. 4 cell carriers, while SoftBank is only really giving an inch.

In a separate filing, Dish said the merger would likely increase prices for consumers and that T-Mobile and Sprint have overstated their argument that the carriers need to combine to build a 5G network, the next-generation wireless network that is expected to bring faster data speeds.  T-Mobile and Sprint have previously cited cable companies such as Comcast Corp CMCSA.O and Charter Communications Inc CHTR.O, which are entering the wireless industry, as evidence of growing competition.  The Communications Workers of America, a union that represents some telecommunications workers, also said in a separate FCC filing on Monday that the merger will result in more than 28,000 job losses.  In response to the FCC filings, T-Mobile and Sprint said in a joint statement on Tuesday that they were confident the merger will create more competition and be positive for consumers.  \u201cThese filings are part of the normal FCC open comment process and we welcome the opportunity for this important dialogue. We look forward to submitting our responses by the September 17th filing date,\u201d the companies said.","69":"A sign for a T-Mobile store is seen in Manhattan, New York, U.S., April 30, 2018. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  (Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.O said Monday it is renaming its prepaid brand to Metro by T-Mobile and adding two new unlimited phone plans that will include perks like Google One cloud storage and Amazon AMZN.O Prime, in an effort to remove the perception that prepaid plans have subpar service.  As the third-largest U.S. wireless carrier awaits regulatory approval for its $26 billion deal to buy smaller rival Sprint Corp S.N, T-Mobile is blurring the lines between its brands to avoid regulators ordering T-Mobile to divest Metro as a condition to approve the merger, one analyst said.  T-Mobile is sweetening the former MetroPCS brand, which is aimed at budget-conscious users who pay upfront for wireless service, with access to the latest smartphone models and added perks that are usually associated with pricier service plans. Those are paid at the end of the month and often require a credit check.  \u201cThis makes Metro and T-Mobile more of a continuum rather than two distinct brands,\u201d said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics, in an interview.  Opponents of the merger have demanded T-Mobile divest some of its customers, pointing to T-Mobile and Sprint\u2019s large combined market share of prepaid customers, which would be over 50 percent, according to data from Kagan, S&P Global Market Intelligence. Sprint owns prepaid brand Boost Mobile.  T-Mobile\u2019s rebranding of MetroPCS is aimed at changing the perception of the business among people who equated prepaid with low quality, or did not realize MetroPCS operated on T-Mobile\u2019s network, said Tom Keys, president of Metro by T-Mobile, in an interview.  Peter Adderton, founder of Boost Mobile, said the rebranding does not change the fact that prepaid and postpaid are different markets, and he called for regulators to evaluate the merger\u2019s effect on them separately.  Adderton, who is no longer affiliated with Boost\u2019s business in the United States, had previously called for the companies to divest some users and formal regulation to ensure that smaller wireless companies that operate off T-Mobile and Sprint\u2019s networks could stay competitive.  Metro by T-Mobile\u2019s top-tier unlimited plan will cost $60 for one line and include both Google One and Amazon Prime.","70":"(Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.O said on Wednesday it added more monthly bill paying phone subscribers than expected in the first quarter, thanks to a surge in demand for cheaper phone services as people work from home amid coronavirus lockdowns.

REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  The telecoms operator said it was confident it would emerge strongly from the pandemic as it expects to lure customers from rivals with its lower priced services.  However, the company did not give a full-year outlook, citing uncertainty linked to the pandemic, following in the steps of its competitors AT&T Inc T.N and Verizon Communications VZ.N.  Shares rose 0.60% in after-market trading.  T-Mobile added 452,000 net new monthly paying phone subscribers in the first quarter, above analysts\u2019 estimates of 426,000, according to research firm FactSet.  The company\u2019s postpaid phone churn, or the rate of customer cancellations, for the first-quarter was 0.86%, compared to 0.88% last year, reflecting store closures and nationwide stay-at-home orders.  As millions of people in the United States have lost their jobs, T-Mobile Chief Executive Mike Sievert said he expected budget-constrained customers to be attracted to the company\u2019s services.  \u201cI expect that AT&T and Verizon customers will most certainly be looking to get out from under their high monthly bills in search of a better value,\u201d Sievert said during an earnings call.  The company posted a marginal rise in revenue to $11.1 billion from a year earlier, but missed expectations of $11.4 billion.  T-Mobile had closed 80% of its stores to comply with the lockdowns. However, an increase in service revenue offset the fall in demand.  The company said it was expanding its 5G rollout as demand continues to rise during the lockdowns and that it built over 1,000 network sites in April. T-Mobile Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray said the network is \u201cgrowing like a weed.\u201d  The report was the first since T-Mobile closed its $23 billion merger with Sprint Corp in April and switched its executive leadership.  The company said the coronavirus pandemic would continue to negatively impact in the second quarter while it integrated Sprint\u2019s network.  T-Mobile expects to add up to 150,000 net monthly phone subscribers in the second quarter. The company said that its merger-related costs would range from $500 million to $600 million before taxes and its COVID-19 pandemic-related costs would be between $450 million to $550 million before taxes.  Last week, T-Mobile said in a preliminary report that Sprint lost 348,000 monthly phone subscribers in the first quarter, more than double the amount of Sprint\u2019s subscriber losses from last year.  The filing also said that Sprint defines subscribers differently from T-Mobile and that the Sprint results would be materially lower once T-Mobile reporting policies were applied. Sprint\u2019s standalone results for the first quarter are expected to be released in May.

In June, a group of U.S. state attorneys general filed a lawsuit in federal court in New York to block the merger of the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers, arguing that the proposed $26 billion deal would cost consumers more than $4.5 billion annually.  To win over the Justice Department, which is not involved in the lawsuit, T-Mobile and Sprint have agreed to a series of deal concessions, including selling the prepaid brand Boost.  The companies have been in talks for weeks to sell Boost to Dish Network Corp but are haggling over issues such as restrictions over who can buy the divested assets if they are sold in the future. T-Mobile and Deutsche Telekom, which owns 63 percent of T-Mobile, are seeking to prevent them from going to a cable or technology company.  Sprint is controlled by Softbank Group Corp.  The companies told the court in late June that they were willing to refrain from closing the deal until after the state attorneys general case is completed.  The two companies have a July 29 deadline to complete the deal but are expected to extend it.

T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere said in an interview he felt confident regulators will approve the current merger structure without having to divest parts of the business.  The combined T-Mobile and Sprint would be able to better compete against larger rivals Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N and AT&T Inc T.N, and combine resources to build the next-generation wireless network, or 5G.

While Justice Department staff balked at the merger, the Federal Communications Commission indicated on Monday it had reached an agreement in principle with the companies to allow the deal after the companies agreed to sell Sprint\u2019s prepaid brand Boost Mobile.  The final decision on whether to allow two of the four nationwide wireless carriers to merge now lies with political appointees at the department, headed by antitrust division chief Makan Delrahim.  Sprint shares fell 4.2% at $6.92 while T-Mobile dipped nearly 1% at $76.49.  The Justice Department, which often follows staff recommendations, is expected to make a final decision in about a month, the sources said.  Staff at the antitrust division, who remain in their jobs even when administrations change, have long been skeptical of the proposed merger, sources have told Reuters.  T-Mobile has a reputation for aggressively seeking to cut prices and improve service to woo customers away from market leaders Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc, and staff may want to preserve that dynamic.

A second antitrust expert, who declined to be identified, noted a previous deal during the Trump administration in which staff recommended filing a lawsuit to block the transaction but they were overruled.  AT&T and Verizon each have 34% of the U.S. wireless market, T-Mobile has 18% and Sprint has 12%, analyst Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson said in a blog post this week. Smaller carrier make up the balance.  In discussions with the FCC, T-Mobile and Sprint also promised not to terminate a deal that would allow cable operator Altice USA Inc to offer mobile phone service later this year using Sprint\u2019s network.  Altice had urged the FCC to reject the deal because it was concerned it would be stopped from offering the phone service.  The companies also pledged that the merged company would build a \u201cworld-leading\u201d 5G network, touted as the next generation of wireless service. They promised to give rural Americans robust 5G broadband and enhanced home broadband.  The FCC and Justice Department almost always agree publicly on merger reviews, and experts say they have not had a major review disagreement in four decades.  Now, state attorneys general and public utility commissions will review the deal, potentially pushing a closing to the third quarter of this year, a Citibank note said.

They are also promising job growth and lower costs for wireless customers.  NO BREAKUP FEE  Sprint asked T-Mobile to be paid a breakup fee should regulators block their deal, people familiar with the confidential negotiations said, a standard form of insurance for acquisition targets when it comes to mergers with high antitrust risk.  However, T-Mobile managed to avoid it, arguing the deal was already generous enough for Sprint and that the companies should demonstrate confidence in the deal\u2019s regulatory prospects by having no such breakup fee, the sources said. With no appetite to terminate deal negotiations for the third time in four years, Sprint accepted, the sources said.  \u201cThe lack of a break-up fee suggests that both companies are willing to \u2018give it a try\u2019 from a regulatory point of view given the very significant synergies opportunities,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Simon Flannery said.  Under their contract, T-Mobile is still liable to pay Sprint a $600 million fee if it walks away from the deal despite it having been cleared by regulators and met other requirements to close, a regulatory filing on Monday showed.  Company officials told the FCC they expect to file a formal application with the commission by the end of May.  In September, the FCC approved a report that found, for the first time since 2009, there is \u201ceffective competition\u201d in the wireless market, a finding that could help Sprint and T-Mobile make the case for the merger.  A decade ago, there were seven major U.S. wireless carriers and today the largest four carriers - led by Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N and AT&T Inc T.N - control 98.8 percent of the U.S. market, the FCC said.  In case the deal falls through, Sprint, with long-term debt of more than $32 billion, will be under much more stress than T-Mobile, analysts said.

Marrero did not ask any questions of either party and said he would make a decision \u201cas promptly as possible.\u201d  Glenn Pomerantz, a lawyer for the states, said that the case would impact at least 130 million customers, since a merger would leave the United States with three major phone carriers instead of four.  \u201cIf this merger goes forward, they\u2019re at risk for paying billions of dollars more every single year for those services,\u201d he said.  When T-Mobile majority shareholder Deutsche Telekom first contemplated the deal in 2010, it \u201cexpressly and unambiguously admitted that it had potential to reduce price competition,\u201d Pomerantz said.  David Gelfand, an attorney representing T-Mobile, said in his closing statement that the merger would offer cost savings, which would trickle down to lower prices for consumers.  The U.S. Justice Department approved the deal in July after the carriers agreed to sell some assets to satellite provider Dish Network Corp, which would create its own cellular network to ensure that there would still be four competitors in the market. The Federal Communications Commission signed off on the deal in October.  Executives from the companies, including outspoken T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere, testified during the trial that Sprint\u2019s business was deteriorating and would not survive if it did not merge with T-Mobile.  The carriers argued that selling Sprint\u2019s prepaid business and some wireless spectrum to Dish Network Corp would help the satellite TV provider become a mobile competitor and preserve a fourth wireless company in the industry.  The states, led by New York and California, maintained that Dish was ill-equipped to become a competitive fourth wireless carrier, and said Wednesday that Dish lacks experience, scale and brand recognition in wireless.  In rebuttal, Pomerantz emphasized that Sprint could turn itself around the same way T-Mobile had previously when it launched 4G technology.  \u201cThey\u2019re not in a dire position; they\u2019re in an advantageous situation and they just need to invest in their business and compete,\u201d he said.","84":"VIENNA, March 7 (Reuters) - Austria has awarded licences to Deutsche Telekom\u2019s T-Mobile, Telekom Austria\u2019s A1 and Hutchison Drei in the country\u2019s first 5G auction, raising 188 million euros ($213 million), telecoms regulator RTR said on Thursday.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Sprint\u2019s latest round of merger talks with T-Mobile, reported earlier this week, came just five months after their previous deal negotiations ended. This is the companies\u2019 third attempt to clinch a deal in the last four years.  While the time window for a deal is not clearly defined, the companies need to act before a U.S. wireless spectrum auction in November. Sprint\u2019s and SoftBank\u2019s deteriorating finances and the 2020 U.S. presidential election also make it unlikely they will get another chance, sources close to the negotiations and analysts said.  \u201cThe view is, if they are going to pursue a merger, now is the time,\u201d Macquarie analyst Amy Yong said. \u201cT-Mobile can help them turn around the network.\u201d  SoftBank controls Sprint through its 85 percent stake. Son pulled out of merger talks with T-Mobile in November after he changed his mind on the valuation he would accept. His willingness to entertain a deal again led to the negotiations restarting, sources have said.  Sprint is saddled with long-term debt of more than $32 billion and has also signaled that its capital investment is going to double, as it seeks to build out its network to compete against T-Mobile, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc. Analysts have warned Sprint will struggle to handle this burden on its own unless it cuts a deal with T-Mobile soon.  \u201cWith a significant step-up in their network capex of an incremental $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion year-on-year beginning in fiscal 2018, it is hard to see Sprint coming close to free cash flow breakeven, much less cash flow positive, in the foreseeable future,\u201d MoffettNathanson LLC analyst Craig Moffett wrote in a note.  A Sprint spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the company was under time pressure to complete a merger with T-Mobile. T-Mobile and SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  SoftBank has its own mounting financial constraints following a string of acquisitions and needs to pay down debt, which reached 15.8 trillion yen ($147 billion) as of the end of December. It has said it is planning to raise cash by taking its Japanese mobile phone unit public this year.  The Federal Communications Commission has tentatively scheduled its next spectrum auction for November. If either Sprint or T-Mobile registered to participate in the auction, they would be barred from merger talks until the auction results are disclosed, Moffett said. The previous spectrum auction put deal discussions on ice for about a year.  If Sprint waits longer, the regulatory environment could become more hostile to a deal than it is currently. The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit to block AT&T\u2019s $85 billion deal to acquire U.S. media company Time Warner Inc over concerns over the pricing power of the combined company.  Sprint\u2019s and T-Mobile\u2019s first round of talks was abandoned in 2014 after the Obama administration expressed concerns about prices for wireless customers rising should the No. 3 and No.4 market players combine.  Any proposed deal would take at least a year for regulatory approval, raising the question of how the next presidential election little more than two years away would affect a merger, Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner said.  Sprint and T-Mobile would be better off attempting a merger under the current Trump administration rather than risk the odds of a Democratic administration in 2020, Entner added.","89":"German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz arrives for the Informal meeting of economic and financial affairs ministers (ECOFIN) in Sofia, Bulgaria, April 27, 2018.

After subtracting its 43% stake in the U.S. carrier - worth $67 billion at Wednesday\u2019s closing price - the value of the non-U.S. business has shrunk to $18 billion.  Hoettges told reporters that Deutsche Telekom\u2019s shares had been dragged down by its struggling rivals and a \u201cdesolate\u201d European market, adding that it was the only European player showing significant growth.  \u201cThe good will show through in the end and will be reflected in our share price,\u201d he said.

Hoettges emphasised Deutsche\u2019s lead over its competitors in rolling out its German 5G network, adding that geopolitical risks from its reliance on Chinese vendor Huawei are manageable.  DE-RISKING  He said it is hoped that a proposed IT security law being considered in Berlin will create legal clarity soon on assessing the suitability of foreign vendors.  Deutsche Telekom also plans to de-risk by supporting new open technology standards for network gear.  \u201cWe are taking steps to reduce our dependence on Asian suppliers,\u201d Hoettges said.

Profit rose 10% on an organic basis after adjusting for the U.S. merger.  Despite the telecoms strength, Deutsche\u2019s troubled IT services unit, T-Systems, has seen incoming orders decline by 25% during the coronavirus crisis.  Finance chief Christian Illek said that reduced IT spending by the automotive and airline industries would necessitate additional restructuring at T-Systems on top of its ongoing three-year turnaround plan.  There were also headwinds from a weaker dollar and lower roaming revenue, while merger-related costs in the United States dented cashflow. Group net debt rose to 124.5 billion euros in the quarter after the extension of a U.S. leasing deal.  Illek said leverage including leases was still on track for a target range of 2.25 to 2.75 times within three years, down from 2.9 times.

In a letter sent to the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai, the senators said that they worried that the deal between the No. 3 and No. 4 wireless service providers would lead to higher prices for consumers.  \u201cT-Mobile and Sprint have led the way in offering wireless products and service options that are more appealing to lower-income consumers, including no contract plans, prepaid and no credit check plans, and unlimited text, voice, and data plans,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.

REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton\/File Photo  Stephen Stokols, who previously founded prepaid brand FreedomPop, said in an interview that Boost has the potential to be as \u201cdisruptive\u201d as U.S. carrier T-Mobile US Inc, which developed a reputation for shaking up the industry by setting precedents such as ending the traditional two-year phone contract.  Dish, a satellite television and internet provider, bought Boost Mobile in July as part of the merger between wireless carriers T-Mobile and Sprint, which owned Boost.  While most U.S. wireless customers pay recurring phone bills at the end of the month on postpaid plans, prepaid users pay for phone service upfront. The plans often appeal to lower-income customers as they do not require a credit check.  Boost aims to expand its digital operations to sell more of its phone plans online, Stokols said. Currently, Boost primarily sells plans at its large number of stores across the country.  The wireless industry has increasingly focused on selling phone plans with unlimited talk, text and data, but some wireless customers use small amounts of data on their smartphones.  \u201cIf you look at the data for users, most use under five gigabytes a month. There\u2019s a huge opportunity to deliver value by offering plan flexibility that addresses that,\u201d Stokols said, declining to offer specifics.  Rival wireless carriers are also ramping up investment in prepaid at a time when many Americans are cutting monthly expenses during the coronavirus pandemic.

This time the companies touted Trump-led tax reforms, synergies at present value of $43 billion and plans to invest billions on developing 5G network. They are also promising job growth and lower costs for wireless customers.  The companies, however, did not give a regulatory break-up fee, hinting at antitrust hurdles they would need to clear to close the deal.  \u201cThe lack of a break up fee suggests that both companies are willing to \u2018give it a try\u2019 from a regulatory point of view given the very significant synergies opportunities,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Simon Flannery said.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Department of Justice are currently scrutinizing the deal.  \u201cThe only remaining thing that is happening is depositions with the DoJ, which have started and will be completed in a few weeks,\u201d CFO J. Braxton Carter told the Morgan Stanley TMT Conference in Barcelona.  \u201cAt this point, it\u2019s more pointing to the second quarter as more probable (but) it could still be first quarter,\u201d Carter said.  Both the agencies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The agreement between the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers in April was reached after four years of on-and-off talks that set the stage for the creation of a company that would compete more favorably with the top two wireless players, Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N and AT&T Inc T.N.  Their first round of merger talks had ended unsuccessfully in 2014 after the then Obama administration expressed antitrust concerns.  Carter said on Friday the companies have provided 25 million pages worth of documents to the DoJ, filed 600 pages public information statement with the FCC and held meetings with other U.S. government departments.  The two companies have also defended their deal by saying they need to merge to build the next generation of 5G wireless technology in a robust nationwide network.  \u201cThe combined assets of Sprint and T-Mobile can create 8 times the 5G capacity that either of us could do on a standalone basis and 15 times the speed,\u201d Carter said.  Telecom companies are pegging their future success on implementation of 5G networks, which are expected to be at least 100 times faster than current 4G networks and cut latency, allowing for innovations in a number of fields.  Governments have started auctioning 5G spectrum on both sides of the Atlantic.  The FCC on Wednesday launched the agency\u2019s first high-band 5G spectrum auction while Germany is expected to start its 5G auctions in early 2019.  There would be \u201cvery, very significant\u201d revenue synergies in the new company resulting from the merger, Carter said at the conference.","106":"HONG KONG, Oct 29 (Reuters) - A five-year old Chinese smartphone company whose high-end products are little known outside a tech-savvy niche is entering the U.S. market on Monday with the backing of two key local allies: chipmaking giant Qualcomm and mobile operator T-Mobile.  The foray by Shenzhen-based OnePlus comes after U.S. mobile carriers AT&T and Verizon this year backed away from plans to work with China\u2019s Huawei on high-end phones in face of pressure from the U.S. government, which considers Huawei a security risk..  But the OnePlus alliance, to be announced today in New York, shows how many U.S.-China business relationships, including those involving the most advanced technologies, are marching ahead despite the U.S. China trade war. OnePlus has quietly become the No. 3 client for Qualcomm\u2019s most expensive mobile phone chips, behind Samsung and LG Electronics, according to data from market researcher Canalys.  Qualcomm president Cristiano Amon last week introduced 29-year-old OnePlus founder Carl Pei to centre stage at its annual partners\u2019 summit in Hong Kong, where Pei told the audience his company would be among the first to a launch a phone fit for fifth-generation (5G) mobile technology using Qualcomm chips.  In an interview, Pei declined to comment on specifics of U.S. carrier relationships. But T-Mobile executives will be part of the Monday event and sources said the company would sell OnePlus phones. Such carrier partnerships are critical to making an impact in the U.S. smartphone market.  \u201cI don\u2019t know if it is a good time for anybody else,\u201d Pei said of the prospect of entering the U.S. carrier-bundled phone market - the dominant channel for sales there. \u201cIt is a good time for us.\u201d  The phone to be unveiled Monday, called the 6T, will sell for a price above $500 but packs features that are typically present only in pricier handsets. Xiaomi, a Chinese rival that also focuses on feature-packed phones at bargain prices, has said it plans to launch in the U.S. next year, but did not respond to a request for comment on whether those plans are still in place.  OnePlus is unusual among Chinese tech companies, which typically focus on mass-market products for domestic customers. OnePlus, by contrast, only sells premium phones that cost $400 or more, almost exclusively online except in India, and derives two-thirds of its revenue from outside China.  It has become the top seller of premium smartphones in India with a 40 percent market share, a price-sensitive market where top-of-the-line phones from Apple and Samsung have gained little traction, according to data from Counterpoint.  Globally, in the above-$400 phone category, Apple dominates with 43 percent of the market, followed by Samsung (24 percent), OPPO (10 percent), Huawei (9 percent), Xiaomi (3 percent) and OnePlus (2 percent), Counterpoint said.  Within the company of about 1,000 employees, fewer than 100 are dedicated to sales while more than half are in product research and development, according to Pei.  OnePlus is affiliated with OPPO, a Chinese smartphone-maker and a major force in mid-end phones, which are sold globally and cost about $300. Canalys analyst Mo Jia said that relationship was critical in helping OnePlus keep its costs low.  Pei said OnePlus shares procurement channels and supply chain with OPPO, which allow it to manufacture in China and India at lower costs than others.  According to Chinese company registration records, the two companies have common shareholders, including the retired Chinese electronics magnate Duan Yongping, who also has ownership in Vivo, another major Chinese smartphone vendor. Both OPPO and Vivo are know for aggressive offline marketing and massive sales channels that reach small town customers in China, India and other developing markets.  QUALCOMM\u2019S QUANDRY  Qualcomm is eager to back OnePlus as it seeks to maintain its lead in the premium mobile chip market.  \u201cMost premium smartphone players, including Apple, Samsung and Huawei, have their own silicon now and are largely using that for their higher-end smartphones,\u201d said IDC senior research manager Kiranjeet Kaur.  Qualcomm, which pioneered key mobile technologies, is locked in a bitter royalty dispute with Apple, which increasingly designs its own processors.  Huawei, which replaced Apple as the second-largest smartphone maker in the world behind Samsung in the second quarter, sells high-end phones with its own Kirin chipsets, while some lower-end models use Qualcomm chips.  Even though Huawei said it had no plan to sell its chips to outsiders, the company is increasingly moving from being a customer to a competitor to Qualcomm as the telecom industry moves to 5G technology.  Qualcomm president Amon described the delicate situation as \u201ca relationship of co-opetition\u201d at the summit last week.  OnePlus, which claims to have sent the world\u2019s first 5G tweet in a test on Friday, said it will launch a 5G phone next year.  Pei shrugged off any concerns that U.S. consumer sentiment would be affected by the China-US trade conflict. \u201cAt the end of the day, all you can control is your own.\u201d  Pei, who was born in China and raised in Sweden, said the brand is cross-cultural and international: \u201cWhen we started, we saw that through social media, you can talk to everyone around the world, as long as you can speak their language.\u201d","107":"","108":"FILE PHOTO: A smartphone with Sprint logo are seen in front of a screen projection of T-mobile logo, in this picture illustration taken April 30, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Testimony ended on Friday in a lawsuit by a group of states led by New York and California seeking to block the merger of Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc, moving the trial a step closer to having a U.S. judge rule on whether the deal violates federal antitrust laws.  The states and the companies now have until Jan. 8 to submit proposed factual findings in writing to U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero in Manhattan federal court. The judge scheduled closing arguments for Jan. 15.  The states filed the lawsuit in June in a bid to block the $26.5 billion merger, saying it would lead to higher prices for consumers. T-Mobile and Sprint have argued that the $26.5 billion merger would enable the combined company to compete more effectively with dominant carriers Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc.  The U.S. Justice Department approved the deal in July after the carriers agreed to sell some assets to satellite provider Dish Network Corp, which would create its own cellular network to ensure that there would still be four competitors in the market. The Federal Communications Commission signed off on the deal in October.  Throughout the trial, the states argued that Dish is not a suitable company to become a fourth wireless carrier because it has not been able to build a network using the wireless spectrum, or airwaves that carry data, it already owns.  In a court filing on Friday, the Justice Department and FCC urged Marrero to rule against the states, saying that if the deal were blocked, rural areas of the United States would be slower to get access to 5G, the next generation of wireless.","109":"(Adds London Stock Exchange Group, KKR; Updates T-Mobile, Telecom Italia)  July 26 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 2000 GMT on Friday:  ** The London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE) is in talks to combine with financial data analytics and trading platform Refinitiv, the Financial Times reported, citing people briefed on the matter.  ** T-Mobile US Inc won U.S. antitrust approval for its $26 billion takeover of rival Sprint Corp, the Justice Department said, clearing a major hurdle to a deal that would merge the nation\u2019s third and fourth largest wireless carriers.  ** U.S. private equity investor KKR said its tender to buy out minority shareholders in Axel Springer had received acceptances on behalf of 6.7% of the shares in the German publisher.  ** Brazilian restaurant operator International Meal Company Alimentacao SA has reached an agreement to merge with the master franchiser of Pizza Hut and KFC in Brazil as the companies seek cost savings in logistics and procurement.  ** Italy\u2019s biggest phone group Telecom Italia and rival Vodafone agreed to merge their mobile tower infrastructure and to jointly roll out 5G in Italy.  ** Swiss utility Axpo said it had signed a deal to market power generated at a solar park in southern Germany under a power purchase agreement (PPA), meaning the facility will be developed using funds from advance sales of its output.  ** British asset manager Schroders Plc said it has agreed to acquire a majority stake in Swiss impact investor BlueOrchard Finance Ltd for an undisclosed sum.  ** Apple Inc took a major step toward supplying its own smartphone chips by purchasing the majority of Intel Corp\u2019s modem business in a deal valued at $1 billion, the companies said.  ** Britain\u2019s Vodafone announced plans to separate its mobile mast operations in Europe into a new company that it potentially could list, in a move it said would unlock value for shareholders.  ** Bankrupt German wind turbine manufacturer Senvion is in talks to buy time to strike a rescue deal as negotiations with potential buyers of the company continue, people close to the matter said.  ** The head of French airports group ADP, which the government is hoping to privatise, said there were times when having a large, single shareholder could be a hindrance, such as in terms of seeking out big deals.  ** French bank Societe Generale has agreed to sell truck and trailer rental company PEMA to a unit of infrastructure investment company I Squared Capital, as SocGen pursues a restructuring plan aimed at selling non-core assets.  ** The biggest investor in defence company Cobham, Silchester International Investors, said that it did not consider a $5 billion offer for the company from private equity firm Advent International as \u2018compelling\u2019.  ** U.S. Justice Department said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the department\u2019s Antitrust Division will announce a significant merger enforcement action.  ** Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway has raised its stake in Bank of America Corp, the company said in a regulatory filing.","110":"WASHINGTON, Dec 9 (Reuters) - U.S. state attorneys general, led by New York and California, deliver opening arguments Monday in a bid to stop T-Mobile U.S. from buying Sprint Corp in a trial that highlights disagreements between federal antitrust enforcers, who are Republican, and Democrats in powerful states.  Attorneys for the 13 states and the District of Columbia will argue in Manhattan federal court that a plan to combine the No. 3 and No. 4 wireless carriers would push up prices, particularly for users of prepaid plans. The state officials, all Democrats, asked Judge Victor Marrero to order the companies to abandon the deal.  The companies argue that the stronger T-Mobile that would result from the proposed $26.5 billion takeover would be better able to innovate and compete to push down wireless prices.  The case represents a break with the usual process of states coordinating with the federal government in reviewing mergers, and generally coming to a joint conclusion.  This deal had been contemplated in 2014 during the Democratic Obama administration but enforcers at the Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission urged the companies to drop the idea, which they did.  Fast forward to 2019, and the Republican Trump administration signed off on the planned merger after the companies agreed to sell Sprint\u2019s prepaid businesses popular with people with poor credit to satellite television company Dish Network Corp.  T-Mobile CEO John Legere, who steps down in April, last month acknowledged talks with Sprint to extend the merger agreement and did not rule out lowering the $26.5 billion price that was originally agreed upon.  The states argue the merger would leave just three nationwide wireless carriers, Verizon Communications, AT&T and the new T-Mobile, which could lead to higher prices.  \u201cThese higher prices would fall hardest on the credit-challenged and low-income consumers who have benefited the most from the competition between Sprint and T-Mobile,\u201d they said in a court filing.  Setting up satellite company DISH as a wireless carrier is \u201cpatently insufficient to mitigate the merger\u2019s competitive harm,\u201d they argued in a court filing.  In a pretrial filing by the companies, they said the stronger, merged firm will be better positioned to compete with AT&T and Verizon as the world moves to the next generation of wireless, or 5G.  \u201cPrices will go down, not up, as a result of the merger,\u201d the companies argued in their filing, saying the deal would create $40 billion in efficiencies.

T-Mobile majority-owner Deutsche Telekom DTEGn.DE will own a little over 40 percent of the combined company, but will have voting control so it can consolidate the company on its books, the sources said. The sources requested anonymity to discuss the confidential negotiations.  Sprint shares ended up 8.3 percent at $6.50 on the news first reported by Reuters, close to where the deal values the company based on the implied stock exchange ratio tied to T-Mobile\u2019s shares. T-Mobile shares rose 0.6 percent to $64.52, giving the company a market capitalization of $55 billion.  T-Mobile and Sprint are aiming to announce the deal on Sunday, though the timing could change, the sources said. Talks between Deutsche Telekom and Japan's SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T, Sprint's controlling shareholder, could still end unsuccessfully at the last minute, the sources added.  Deutsche Telekom owns more than 63 percent of T-Mobile, while SoftBank owns 84.7 percent of Sprint.  Sprint, T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom and SoftBank did not respond to requests for comment.  The companies came close to a merger deal in November before SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son pulled out of the talks at the last minute over valuation disagreements. Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Hoettges left the door open by saying, \u201cYou always meet twice in life.\u201d  Even though Sprint\u2019s customer base has expanded under CEO Marcelo Claure, growth has been driven by discounting. Analysts have said that without T-Mobile, Sprint lacks the scale needed to invest in its network and to compete in a saturated market.  T-Mobile, under CEO John Legere, has fared better than Sprint, even if it remains a distant third to Verizon and AT&T. It has scored sustained market share gains, as innovative offerings, improving network performance and good customer service attract new customers, according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service Inc.  T-Mobile became the first major U.S. carrier to eliminate two-year contracts, a shift quickly embraced by consumers and copied by competitors. The company has also unsettled rivals with its unlimited data plans.  Regulatory hurdles could also block to the deal. Sprint and T-Mobile\u2019s first round of merger talks ended in 2014 after U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s administration expressed antitrust concerns about it.  AT&T agreed to acquire U.S. media company Time Warner Inc TWX.N in October 2016 for $85 billion. The U.S. Department of Justice has sued to block the deal over concerns about the companies' pricing power in the media market. AT&T and Time Warner are defending their proposed merger in court.  The U.S. government has also opened a probe into alleged coordination by AT&T, Verizon Communications and a telecommunications standards organization to hinder consumers from easily switching wireless carriers, a person briefed on the matter said last week. This signals U.S. regulators\u2019 growing concern about consumer prices.","113":"WASHINGTON, June 14 (Reuters) - Dish Network Corp executives met this week with the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief Makan Delrahim and Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai on the government\u2019s review of the proposed $26.5 billion tie-up of wireless carriers T-Mobile USA and Sprint Corp.

The deal, which could be challenged by the Justice Department, Federal Communications Commission, state attorneys general or utilities commissions, has been criticized because it would reduce the number of national wireless carriers available to consumers from four to three.  MoffettNathanson argued that a recent report that a group of state attorneys general were prepared to fight the deal without help from the federal government - an unusual but not unprecedented situation - actually increased the likelihood that the Justice Department or FCC would act to stop the proposed transaction.  \u201cIf the DOJ and FCC approve the transaction, the approval would almost certainly be branded as both \u2018Republican\u2019 and \u2018pro-business\/anti-consumer,\u2019\u201d the analyst note said. \u201cThe Blue State AG press release arguing \u2018if they won\u2019t protect you, we will\u2019 almost writes itself.\u201d  The deal to combine the No. 3 and No. 4 U.S. wireless carriers was struck in April 2018.

Crown Castle International and SBA Communications are most exposed to the deal as they count Sprint and T-Mobile as their top customers, while larger rival American Tower Corp would be affected less.  All companies were not immediately available for a comment.  \u201cWhen you think about the portfolio mix, American Tower has a larger international business, so the impact on their stock price would be a bit less than it would be for Crown Castle or SBA,\u201d Deo said.

Lehrburger ruled at a hearing in Manhattan federal court, less than three weeks before a scheduled Dec. 9 trial to determine whether T-Mobile, the third-largest U.S. wireless carrier, may go forward with its merger with Sprint, the fourth-largest.  Attorneys general from the 15 states and Washington, D.C. contend that the merger will boost prices and harm consumers, especially poorer ones.

Marick said he has not yet submitted a comment and is not opposed to doing so, adding he did not view the email as pressure to issue a comment.  While it is not unheard of for companies pursuing mergers to ask vendors or customers for support, there could be a small amount of coercion going on, given that some of the smaller wireless companies have direct relationships with T-Mobile, said James Cox, a Duke Law School professor who specializes in corporate and securities law.  T-Mobile, which is majority-owned by Germany's Deutsche Telekom DTEGn.DE, and Sprint, majority-owned by Japan's SoftBank Group 9984.T, declined to comment. Both companies have previously said they expect the deal to win regulatory approval.  Consumer Cellular and other smaller wireless companies operate by purchasing access to the four major U.S. carriers\u2019 networks at wholesale rates, and often market their phone plans to specific users, such as low-income groups or minorities.  Earlier this month, a source told Reuters that U.S. antitrust enforcers are in the early stages of reviewing the merger and have reached no conclusions on how many wireless carriers the country needs.  The Obama administration had previously taken actions to keep four wireless carriers in the United States to ensure enough competition.  T-Mobile and Sprint have argued, however, they need to combine to more quickly build a 5G network, as countries like China and South Korea are currently ahead of the United States in 5G investment.","121":"March 16 (Reuters) -  * DEUTSCHE TELEKOM HOLDING - ENDED PURCHASE PROGRAM OF T-MOBILE US'S COMMON STOCK AND TERMINATED SALES TRADING PLAN ENTERED INTO DATED FEB 9 - SEC FILING Source text: (bit.ly\/2pgxYUs) Further company coverage:","122":"May 3 (Reuters) - U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp\u2019s outgoing chief executive, Marcelo Claure, told Reuters on Thursday that he expected negative stock reaction due to scepticism over the chances of the proposed merger with T-Mobile US Inc being approved.

Shares of the company were up 1.6 percent at $68.04 in morning trading.  The company, the third-largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscriber count, is awaiting approval of its deal to buy smaller rival Sprint Corp as it strives for more scale to compete with bigger rivals Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc.  T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere said during an earnings call with analysts that he still expects the deal to be approved in the first half of this year.  T-Mobile said it added a net of about 1 million so-called postpaid phone subscribers in the fourth quarter compared with 891,000 additions a year earlier. Analysts were expecting 912,000 new subscribers, according to research firm FactSet.  Analysts watch the postpaid figure, because those customers pay a recurring monthly bill and are more valuable to carriers that prepaid users.  The wireless carrier said it expects to add, without Sprint, 2.6 million to 3.6 million net new postpaid customers in 2019.  T-Mobile added network capacity in rural areas of the United States, which allowed it to build more retail stores in those areas and expand the carrier\u2019s geographical footprint, said Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with New Street Research.  T-Mobile has just a 10 percent market share of business customers, said Chief Operating Officer Mike Sievert during the call, giving the carrier opportunity for more growth.  \u201cNow that the network is there ... we\u2019re starting to see these kinds of customers come in, in historic numbers,\u201d Sievert said.

Revenue rose to $11.45 billion from $10.76 billion.  Analysts were expecting revenue of $11.39 billion and profit of 69 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Striking a bullish tone after a New York judge threw out a petition brought by a dozen U.S. states to block the deal, Hoettges said the 'new' T-Mobile would go on the attack and look to close a valuation gap with AT&T T.N and Verizon VZ.N.  \u201cWe have the chance to become No.1 in the United States, to overtake AT&T and Verizon. That is our ambition,\u201d Hoettges told reporters in Bonn after Deutsche Telekom reported record annual results in its 25th year as a listed company.  Ebullient, Hoettges brandished a coffee cup bearing a picture of U.S. World War Two character Rosie the Riveter and the slogan \u2018We Can Do It\u2019 in front of photographers. His mood was buoyed further by a 3.7% jump in Deutsche Telekom shares, bringing year-to-date gains to 13%.  \u201cThe results were strong, particularly in Europe, and reassuring on Germany,\u201d said Citi analyst Georgios Ierodiaconou.  Hoettges, 57, has campaigned for seven years to do a U.S. deal that, on completion, would create a transatlantic business with $120 billion in revenues and 270 million customers. A breakthrough came in April 2018 when T-Mobile and Sprint, controlled by Japan's Softbank Group 9984.T, agreed to a $26 billion all-stock deal.  The process of winning anti-trust approved dragged: Concessions offered in a back-and-forth with U.S. regulators brought the deal close to the finish line last year, but the suit filed by attorneys general from mainly Democrat-led states threatened to derail it within sight of the finish line.  With last week\u2019s New York court ruling in favor of the deal, Hoettges now expects it to close by April 1, subject to resolving outstanding regulatory and legal issues.  Importantly, synergies of $43 billion targeted in the original merger remained intact, Hoettges said. Once completed, the German group would own 42% of the \u2018new\u2019 T-Mobile but have a voting stake of 67% and control of the board.  Hoettges declined to comment when asked whether T-Mobile would seek to drive a harder bargain in the deal, which has passed its expiry date but is still supported by both parties, to reflect a deterioration in Sprint\u2019s business.  VALUATION GAP  Highlighting the positive market reaction after the New York ruling, Hoettges said the new T-Mobile would have a market value on paper of around $120 billion. That compares with $274 billion for AT&T T.N and $242 billion for Verizon VZ.N.  \u201cThat is a difference of around $120 billion. I see no reason why this cannot be reduced considerably,\u201d he said, highlighting Sprint\u2019s spectrum assets as a key competitive advantage.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  The three main U.S. wireless carriers would have similar customer numbers of between 140 million and 150 million, Hoettges added: \u201cThat puts us on an equal footing and in a position to ramp up attacks on the competition.\u201d  Deutsche Telekom forecast core earnings of 25.5 billion euros ($27.5 billion) this year, representing a slowdown in growth to 3% and below analysts\u2019 consensus forecast.

The company agreed that for at least five years it will offer an unlimited talk, text and 2GB data plan for $15 per month and a $25 per month plan for 5GB of data.  \u201cThe world around us is almost fully digital, but Mississippi is lagging behind with internet deserts across the state,\u201d Hood said. \u201cMy agreement with T-Mobile will help fill this gap.\u201d  T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere said on Twitter the company was \u201cthrilled\u201d Hood \u201cwithdrew from the states\u2019 lawsuit after learning more about ALL the amazing benefits the New T-Mobile will deliver to US consumers!\u201d  T-Mobile has also promised to roll out a broadband service that will be available to hundreds of thousands of Mississippians, Hood said.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Shares of the company rose nearly 2 percent to $68.01 in trading before the bell.  The company, the third-largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscriber count, is awaiting approval of its deal to buy smaller rival Sprint Corp as it strives for more scale to compete with bigger rivals Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc.  T-Mobile said it added a net of about 1 million so-called postpaid phone subscribers in the fourth quarter compared with 891,000 additions a year earlier. Analysts were expecting 912,000 new subscribers, according to research firm FactSet.  Analysts watch the postpaid figure, because those customers pay a recurring monthly bill and are more valuable to carriers that prepaid users.  The wireless carrier said it expects to add, without Sprint, 2.6 million to 3.6 million net new postpaid customers in 2019.  T-Mobile added network capacity in rural areas of the United States, which allowed it to build more retail stores in those areas and expand the carrier\u2019s geographical footprint, said Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with New Street Research.  The company\u2019s net income fell to $640 million, or 75 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, from $2.71 billion, or $3.11 a share, a year earlier, when it recorded a big one-time tax related gain.  Revenue rose to $11.45 billion from $10.76 billion.  Analysts were expecting revenue of $11.39 billion and profit of 69 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  T-Mobile, as well as the country\u2019s other major carriers, are racing to build the next generation wireless network, or 5G, expected to bring faster data speeds.  T-Mobile told the U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Monday it would not increase prices for three years, with few exceptions, if it gets approval to buy Sprint for $26 billion.","148":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - U.S. wireless carriers T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp are considering divesting wireless spectrum, according to two sources familiar with the matter, as the companies work to gain regulatory approval for their merger.

It was not immediately clear what the sale process would be for the spectrum, or airwaves that carry data. Bloomberg reported earlier on Thursday that T-Mobile and Sprint were considering divesting spectrum back to the government, which would then sell it to help establish a fourth carrier, citing sources.  The two carriers had previously offered concessions to get the merger approved, which includes selling prepaid brand Boost Mobile, in order to reduce the combined company\u2019s market share in the prepaid wireless business.

SoftBank's shares have more than doubled since the middle of March, despite the economic uncertainty fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, as CEO Masayoshi Son moves to shed or trim its stakes in other companies such as Alibaba Group Holding BABA.N.  While the divestments have bankrolled a string of share buybacks, delighting investors including hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, they have raised concerns among credit ratings agencies about the Japanese conglomerate\u2019s financial standing.  They come after several of SoftBank's investments, including on office space-sharing start-up WeWork and payment processor Wirecard AG WDIG.DE, soured, and it suspended efforts to raise a successor to its $100 billion Vision Fund.  Many of the T-Mobile shares divested by SoftBank were acquired by T-Mobile itself, which will in turn sell them on to the open market and private investors. SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure will acquire more than $500 million of T-Mobile stock, according to regulatory filings.  All in all, SoftBank will divest two-thirds of its 24.6% stake in T-Mobile. It also granted Deutsche Telekom AG DTEGn.DE, owner of a 43.6% stake in T-Mobile, call options to acquire its remaining T-Mobile shares. The call options expire in 2024.

T-Mobile and Sprint announced a $26 billion all-stock deal on Sunday, saying they believed they could win over skeptical regulators because the merger would create thousands of jobs and help the United States beat China in creating 5G, the next generation mobile network.  But consumer groups complained the deal would lead to higher prices, hitting low-income people the hardest and leaving them fewer alternatives for communication.  Amparo Calcawell knows this well. The 62-year-old hairdresser has already lost her $50 per month Boost Mobile service due to a missed payment and fears higher prices will force her to find a new provider.  The New York City resident, speaking outside a Boost Mobile store in Manhattan holding a fistful of cash, needs her phone to keep in touch with family: \u201cThis is why a phone is so important.\u201d  The Federal Communications Commission and Justice Department will likely review the proposed deal to determine if it would harm competition or if it is in the public interest.  While AT&T and Verizon dominate the U.S. wireless market overall, T-Mobile is the most popular among customers who make less than $75,000 per year, and Sprint\u2019s pre-paid brand Boost counts 83 percent of its users in that income range, according to data from Kagan, S&P Global Market Intelligence data.  T-Mobile has 38 percent of the U.S. pre-paid market, while Sprint has 16 percent, which would give the combined company 54 percent, according to S&P.  \u201cLower income consumers are likely to lose the most options and face stiff price hikes because Sprint and T-Mobile are the only game in town for them,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, president of advocacy group Public Knowledge and a former chief counsel for the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division.  In its antitrust review, the Justice Department would likely view the prepaid market as a separate market, and if they do the companies could be in for a tough review, experts said.  \u201cIt\u2019s clearly putting a more than 50 percent leader in the market. That will draw serious scrutiny,\u201d said Caroline Holland, a Mozilla tech policy fellow who formerly served as chief counsel for competition and intergovernmental relations in DOJ\u2019s antitrust division.  Consumers are already questioning the fewer choices among the major carriers. Sharron Cannon, 60, who lives in Harlem, New York, said she had canceled her Sprint plan because she was unhappy with the service and moved to T-Mobile, only to find out the companies were combining.  Now Cannon, an entrepreneur who depends on her phone to run her business, said she is concerned her bill will go up.  Spokespeople for T-Mobile and Sprint had no immediate comment for this story. AT&T and Verizon declined comment.  WHOLESALE WOES  T-Mobile and Sprint sell their airwaves to smaller wireless carriers that also serve low-income and budget-conscious customers, and a merger could hurt those carriers\u2019 ability to negotiate for lower prices, said Stephen Stokols, chief executive of FreedomPop, which offers a free phone plan and uses Sprint\u2019s network.  Retail wireless prices have declined over the past year and a half, but Stokols predicts price cuts will end after the merger.  FreedomPop has more than 2 million customers, and about 20 percent make less than $40,000 per year, Stokols said, adding about half of users are on the free phone service plan.  Since T-Mobile and Sprint have their own branded pre-paid users, and also power smaller pre-paid operators, the control the company would have over the market is concerning, Stokols said.  The deal is \u201cgood for the market, but bad for consumers,\u201d Stokols said. \u201cT-Mobile and Sprint have been driving down pricing previously. you won\u2019t have competition at the bottom level anymore.\u201d (Reporting by Sheila Dang in New York and Diane Bartz in Washington; Editing by David Gregorio)","154":"BERLIN, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom raised its earnings guidance on Thursday as its reported forecast-beating third-quarter results, lifted by outperformance at its recently-merged U.S. unit T-Mobile.

The merger between the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers was agreed in April 2018, but was prevented from closing by U.S. states challenging it in court on antitrust grounds. A U.S. federal judge gave the companies the green light Tuesday to complete the deal.  Before it is completed, T-Mobile\u2019s German parent, Deutsche Telekom AG, plans to ask Sprint\u2019s majority owner, Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group, to agree to a lower price, arguing that Sprint\u2019s fortunes have deteriorated following their agreement two years ago, sources told Reuters on Monday.  However, investors are pricing in only a modest potential haircut. Sprint shares were trading at around $8.3 on Tuesday, a 14% discount to the $9.6 per share price that the all-stock deal with T-Mobile assigns Sprint.  The market is assuming an approximately 9% cut to the deal price, Cowen analysts wrote in a research note on Monday after the companies\u2019 shares soared on news that the merger could go ahead.  T-Mobile has plenty of arguments it can deploy in a renegotiation with Sprint. The latter\u2019s market share in subscribing phone customers is down from 12.4% at the start of 2018 to 11.8% in the third quarter of 2019, according to Cowen analysts, as it shed 400,000 customers. Meanwhile, its debt pile rose from $33 billion to $34.1 billion.  SoftBank\u2019s prospects have also worsened, making it harder for it to walk away from a deal. The Japanese conglomerate is struggling to raise money from investors for its second $100 billion Vision Fund, as high-profile bets on start-ups such as WeWork backfired.  Nevertheless, T-Mobile will likely be mindful about jeopardizing the deal with Sprint, because it needs the merger to take on bigger rivals Verizon Communications and AT&T in the race for the development of next-generation wireless 5G technology, analysts said.  \u201cThe only credible fallback is if T-Mobile says they\u2019re willing to walk away, and I don\u2019t think anyone would take them seriously,\u201d said Craig Moffett, a telecom analyst at MoffettNathanson.  The merger would form a wireless giant with 126 million customers and help T-Mobile in the race for 5G by utilizing Sprint\u2019s valuable spectrum. It would also allow T-Mobile to save on costs by eliminating overlapping infrastructure.  Despite the decline in its business, the valuation of Sprint\u2019s 2.5 GHz spectrum, a prime band for 5G deployment, has doubled to $25 billion from 2016 to 2019, analysts at JPMorgan estimate. Both Verizon and T-Mobile are short on spectrum amid growing usage, according to New Street Research analysts.  \u201cThe primary leverage Sprint has is that T-Mobile\u2019s growth and pending launch of 5G makes that spectrum depth very important to T-Mobile,\u201d said Walt Piecyk, an analyst at LightShed Partners. \u201cI would not be shocked if there was no change in price, because it\u2019s been such a lengthy process, and the demand for spectrum continues to rise.\u201d  T-Mobile said on Tuesday it expects the deal to close by April 1. Its executives have maintained on previous earnings calls the company hoped to close the deal in early 2020.  \u201cA renegotiation won\u2019t be easy, and by far the most important objective for both sides will be to close and move on to integrating,\u201d said Jonathan Chaplin, analyst at New Street Research.

The United States can restrict sales to blacklisted firms of goods made domestically as well as goods made abroad containing U.S. technology.  It expanded the definition of military end use in April to include any firm that supported the maintenance or production of military items even if they primarily did commercial business.  CloudMinds has since been bailed out by a state-backed fund in Shanghai as part of Chinese government action to prop up such firms, said two other people familiar with the matter.  It has also been on a promotional drive by marketing its technology as a coronavirus countermeasure, with the U.S. re-branding to Wright Robotics an attempt to avoid negative baggage associated with the CloudMinds name, the first two sources said.

During a failed attempt to list in the United States, it identified its local unit as CloudMinds Technology Inc.  Filings signed by its head of U.S. operations, Karl Zhao, showed CloudMinds Technology Inc became Harix Cloud Robotics Inc in July and then Wright Robotics Inc in August.

T-Mobile reported 98.3 million customers in those categories, while AT&T had nearly 93 million postpaid and prepaid subscribers in its second quarter.  Subscriber figures between U.S. carriers can be difficult to compare given the variety of plans offered. AT&T declined to comment.  T-Mobile added 253,000 net new phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill, compared with 710,000 additions a year earlier.  Analysts had expected 169,200 new subscribers, according to research firm FactSet.  The carrier, which completed its merger with Sprint in April, reported the quarterly results as a combined company for the first time.  T-Mobile said during the earnings call with analysts that more than 10% of network traffic from Sprint\u2019s postpaid customers have been migrated to T-Mobile.  The carrier has sought to attract budget-constrained customers with its cheaper phone plans after the pandemic left millions of people in the United States unemployed.  T-Mobile\u2019s second-quarter net income fell to $110 million, or 9 cents per share, from $939 million, or $1.09 per share, a year earlier, due to Sprint merger costs.  Revenue jumped 61% to $17.67 billion, above analysts\u2019 estimates of $17.61 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.","167":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General William Barr has recused himself from the Justice Department\u2019s deliberations on whether to allow T-Mobile to proceed with its $26 billion acquisition of Sprint, according to a source familiar with the decision.  The department\u2019s Antitrust Division, headed by Makan Delrahim, is reviewing the deal to determine if it will lead to higher prices for consumers or to slower innovation, as critics allege. The Federal Communications Commission also must approve the transaction for it to go forward.  The recusal was first reported by the New York Post.  In a filing with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics in December, Barr acknowledged owning a T-Mobile bond valued at $15,001 to $50,000 and two other T-Mobile bonds and a Sprint bond valued at less than $1,001. Those are to be sold within 90 days of his confirmation, which occurred on Feb. 14.  Barr had also recused himself from considering AT&T\u2019s plan to buy Time Warner, which the government opposed, because of his involvement with those companies. That deal has closed.  T-Mobile announced on Monday that the companies were extending a deadline to complete their deal to July 29. The two are among just four national wireless carriers, trailing Verizon Communications and AT&T.  Regulators are expected to make a decision on the deal in early June. They will be weighing a potential loss of competition, and subsequently higher prices for consumers, against the prospect of a more powerful No. 3 wireless carrier which can work to build a faster, better 5G next generation wireless network.","168":"NEW YORK, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Testimony ended on Friday in a lawsuit by a group of states led by New York and California seeking to block the merger of Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc, moving the trial a step closer to having a U.S. judge rule on whether the deal violates federal antitrust laws.  The states and the companies now have until Jan. 8 to submit proposed factual findings in writing to U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero in Manhattan federal court. The judge scheduled closing arguments for Jan. 15.  The states filed the lawsuit in June in a bid to block the $26.5 billion merger, saying it would lead to higher prices for consumers. T-Mobile and Sprint have argued that the $26.5 billion merger would enable the combined company to compete more effectively with dominant carriers Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc.  The U.S. Justice Department approved the deal in July after the carriers agreed to sell some assets to satellite provider Dish Network Corp, which would create its own cellular network to ensure that there would still be four competitors in the market. The Federal Communications Commission signed off on the deal in October.  Throughout the trial, the states argued that Dish is not a suitable company to become a fourth wireless carrier because it has not been able to build a network using the wireless spectrum, or airwaves that carry data, it already owns.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The $26 billion deal between T-Mobile and Sprint won approval from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission last week after the two carriers offered concessions. It included the sale of Boost to reduce the combined company\u2019s market share in the prepaid wireless business, where customers pay for phone service at the beginning of the month and are not required to pass a credit check.  While the deal awaits a ruling from the U.S. Department of Justice, interested parties are already preparing bids. The sale process is expected to begin after the Justice Department\u2019s review.  Q Link Wireless, a prepaid brand and the third-largest provider of federally assisted wireless plans, is putting together a package to bid for Boost with private equity backing and could pay between $1.8 billion to $3 billion, founder and Chief Executive Issa Asad told Reuters.  The price will depend on the quality of Boost\u2019s customers, such as their level of churn, or the rate of customer cancellations, the devices they are using, and what type of phone plan they are on, none of which the companies have disclosed, he said.  This month, analysts at Cowen estimated Boost has 7 million to 8 million customers and a transaction could be valued at $4.5 billion if the deal included wireless spectrum, or the airwaves that carry data, and facilities. Sprint has not disclosed the number of Boost customers.  Stephen Stokols, chief executive officer of prepaid wireless company FreedomPop, said an undisclosed private equity group he is speaking with have placed Boost\u2019s future value at about $4 billion, such as in an initial public offering.  While FreedomPop is not a bidder, Stokols said he is advising a private equity group preparing a bid. If that bid succeeds, he believes the group would combine their acquisition with FreedomPop and have him lead a combined company with the Boost assets.  Peter Adderton, founder of Boost Mobile who sold the U.S. business to Nextel in 2004, which was then acquired by Sprint, has also said he is interested in buying back Boost. He declined to comment on his valuation for the business.  Adderton said he and his lawyers have urged regulators to require T-Mobile and Sprint to also divest wireless spectrum to ensure Boost will be a viable competitor in the market.  Adderton added that regulators must also ensure the new T-Mobile does not employ anticompetitive practices to harm Boost, and the contract between the companies should be non-exclusive, which would allow Boost to buy network access from other carriers.  The current sale agreement is devoid of details, but with the right terms, \u201cwe can create a dynamic player that will compete in the market,\u201d Adderton said of Boost.  T-Mobile and Sprint did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","172":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is interested in buying prepaid cellphone wireless service Boost Mobile from U.S. carriers T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp, two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.  Amazon is considering buying Boost - currently one of Sprint\u2019s prepaid brands - mainly because the deal would allow it to use the new T-Mobile\u2019s wireless network for at least six years, one of the sources said.  New T-Mobile is the name used by T-Mobile and Sprint to refer to the new entity that will result from their potential merger.  Amazon would also be interested in any wireless spectrum that could be divested, the source said.  Amazon declined to comment. T-Mobile and Sprint did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  It was not immediately clear why the largest U.S. online retailer would want the wireless network and spectrum.  Amazon has already been building experience by offering phone calls through its Echo Connect product, which uses a person\u2019s home phone service and allows an Alexa-enabled voice-activated speaker to make phone calls.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Amazon, which started out selling books, has a long history of exploring new ventures, such as making original TV shows for Amazon Prime members. It is now one of the Big Four technology companies along with Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Facebook Inc, and is a leading cloud services provider.  T-Mobile and Sprint have already pledged to sell Boost as part of measures to reduce their market share in the prepaid wireless business and gain regulatory approval for their planned $26 billion merger.  The U.S. Justice Department would need to scrutinize the buyer of a divested asset to ensure it would stay viable and preserve competition.  The carriers are also considering divesting wireless spectrum, or airwaves that carry data, in order to push the merger through.  The merger, if approved, would leave the United States with three wireless carriers instead of four. Some consumer advocates have raised concerns that the merger could raise prices for wireless users and have called for an additional competitor.  The sale of Boost could fetch up to $3 billion, potential bidders previously told Reuters.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - T-Mobile US and Sprint are pitching an America First 5G deal. The mobile operators agreed on Sunday to merge to create a more powerful competitor to market leaders Verizon and AT&T. Antitrust concerns stymied earlier talks, but T-Mobile US Chief Executive John Legere said the deal would create rural jobs and keep the country ahead of China in the 5G race. That\u2019s likely to appeal to President Donald Trump\u2019s regulators.  The all-stock deal, which values Sprint at $26.5 billion or $6.62 a share, a premium of less than 2 percent over Friday\u2019s close, puts T-Mobile US owner Deutsche Telekom in the driver\u2019s seat. The German company gets to appoint nearly two-thirds of the board and assures that Legere runs the combined operation. Masayoshi Son, whose SoftBank controls Sprint, will be a director and get three other seats for his minority stake. The previous round of merger talks last year collapsed partly over disagreement on which firm would have more say.  The companies figure at least $6 billion in cost savings, which they value at $43 billion. Breakingviews reckons the number is more like $32 billion after taxing those savings at 21 percent, capitalizing them on a multiple of 10 and backing out the $15 billion it will take to achieve the goal. Nonetheless, T-Mobile said those were only network savings. More could be gained as 5G\u2019s much faster speeds enable a host of new services like autonomous vehicles, and new revenue streams.  The real hurdle is regulatory. The two companies abandoned merger talks in 2014 after the Department of Justice and congressional committees expressed concerns about a deal. And the Trump administration is suing to block AT&T\u2019s $85 billion deal for Time Warner.  That explains why Legere and his counterpart at Sprint, Marcelo Claure, are framing their tie-up around issues near and dear to the president. By investing $40 billion, the combination will help the United States leapfrog China in the race to develop the next generation of wireless, they said. That should appeal to an administration that last month blocked Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion bid for chipmaker Qualcomm because of 5G\u2019s importance for national security. T-Mobile and Sprint also promised to create tens of thousands of jobs directly, many of them in Trump\u2019s base of rural America, as they build their network.  The timing, in the midst of the DOJ\u2019s suit against AT&T and Time Warner, is as audacious as the vision. But Legere and his allies are pushing all the right buttons in a bid to get regulators to yes.","174":"July 2 (Reuters) - Assurant Inc:  * ASSURANT APPOINTS FORMER T-MOBILE CFO J.

The five-member panel\u2019s third Republican, Mike O\u2019Rielly, said he was \u201cinclined to support\u201d the proposed merger, even if he was not convinced of the need for all of the conditions announced by Pai.  Sprint shares initially surged 23.2% while T-Mobile shares rose 5.1%, but both pared gains to close at 18.8% and 3.9% higher respectively after a report from Bloomberg News said the Department of Justice, which also has to OK the deal, was leaning against approval. Bloomberg said the department was concerned the proposed remedies did not resolve antitrust concerns.  If the deal is completed, the number of U.S. wireless carriers would drop to three from four, with Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc leading the pack.  Some telecommunications experts have predicted that prices for cellphone service would rise as a result, and U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal agreed.  \u201cThe FCC\u2019s seeming abdication makes it even more important for the Department of Justice to step up to the plate to block this merger,\u201d the Democratic senator said in a statement.  The commission is made up of three Republicans and two Democrats.  FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, tweeted her disapproval.  \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this kind of consolidation in airlines and with drug companies,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t worked out well for consumers. But now the @FCC wants to bless the same kind of consolidation for wireless carriers. I have serious doubts.\u201d  The FCC will not formally vote on the merger on Monday but will first draft an order it plans to circulate for approval in the coming weeks, said the two people briefed on the matter.

Reviews by state attorneys general and public utility commissions could push full approval back to the third quarter of this year, the Citi note said.  The FCC and Justice Department almost always agree publicly on merger reviews, and experts said on Monday the agencies have not had a major review disagreement in four decades.  Andrew Jay Schwartzman, a law professor at Georgetown University, said a Justice Department challenge \u201cwould represent a significant departure from longstanding practice.\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  CONCESSIONS  In a filing with the FCC on Monday, the companies pledged to sell prepaid wireless provider Boost Mobile.  The sale will include the brand name, any active accounts and dedicated Boost assets and staff but no wireless spectrum. The new Boost could buy network access from T-Mobile for at least six years.  The companies pledged they would not scrap a deal with Altice USA, the fourth-largest U.S. cable television company.  Altice has an agreement with Sprint that would allow it to start offering mobile phone service later this year, using Sprint\u2019s network.  One critic of the deal called the concession weak.  \u201cI don\u2019t understand how the mere spinning off of one of three prepaid services would satisfy (Pai), given all the evidence in the record that post-paid (wireless) prices will go up,\u201d said Gigi Sohn, who held a senior FCC position during the Obama administration. \u201cI just think this is very weak tea.\u201d  The Boost sale is aimed at resolving concerns that the deal would give the combined company 54% of the prepaid market, which generally includes those with poor credit who cannot pay with a credit card.  T-Mobile, which is about 63 percent owned by Deutsche Telekom AG, also promised the new company would build a \u201cworld-leading\u201d 5G network, which is supposed to be the next generation of wireless service. It promises to give rural Americans robust 5G broadband and enhance home broadband and could face hefty financial penalties if it did not meet expansion targets.

They have been weighing a potential loss of competition and higher prices for consumers against the prospect of a more powerful No. 3 wireless carrier that can build a faster, better 5G network.

She said there is \u201cabsolutely nothing in this consent decree to compensate consumers.\u201d  FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement that it \u201cis a basic tenet of the nation\u2019s phone system that calls be completed to the called party, without a reduction in the call quality \u2014 even when the calls pass through intermediate providers.\u201d  T-Mobile said it had corrected what it called the \u201cunintentional\u201d issue in January 2017 and added that it is \u201ccommitted to all of our customers across the country.\u201d  False ring tones \u201ccause callers to believe that the phone is ringing at the called party\u2019s premises when it is not,\u201d the FCC said, noting uncompleted calls \u201ccause rural businesses to lose revenue, impede medical professionals from reaching patients in rural areas, cut families off from their relatives, and create the potential for dangerous delays in public safety communications.\u201d  NTCA-The Rural Broadband Association praised the FCC announcement. \u201cContinued vigilance on the part of industry and the commission, combined with enforceable regulatory backstops, clearly remain essential to ensure that rural call failure will not compromise the integrity of our nation\u2019s networks,\u201d Chief Executive Shirley Bloomfield said.  The FCC order did not disclose if any of the hundreds of millions of calls with false ring tones were actually completed.  In July, the FCC said \u201cgiven the relatively high rates long-distance providers incur to terminate long-distance calls to rural carriers, long-distance providers have an incentive to reduce the per-minute cost of calls.\u201d  That gives companies a greater incentive \u201cto hand off a call  to an intermediate provider that is offering to deliver it cheaply,\u201d the FCC said.  T-Mobile told the FCC that in 2007 it began using servers that included a \u201cLocal Ring Back Tone\u201d for calls from certain customers that took more than a certain amount of time to complete.  The FCC in 2014 banned carriers from broadcasting false ring tones, but the agency said in settlement documents that T-Mobile acknowledged it was still using the tones for out-of-network calls from its customers for some calls.

Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai said on Monday he will recommend that the other four commissioners vote to approve the merger. A second member of the five-person FCC, Commissioner Brendan Carr, a Republican, also said he will vote to approve the deal.  Once an order is drafted, the full panel must vote to approve or reject the deal.  Sprint jumped 25.1% to $7.73 while T-Mobile was up 6% to $79.93.  The FCC will not formally vote on the merger on Monday but will first draft an order, two people briefed on the matter said. The Justice Department must also approve the deal.  In a filing with the FCC on Monday, the companies pledged to sell Boost Mobile, a prepaid wireless provider.  Altice USA, the fourth largest cable company, has urged the FCC to reject the deal because it was concerned the combined company could prevent it from offering phone service.  Altice has a Mobile Virtual Network Operator agreement with Sprint that would allow it to start offering mobile phone service later this year. The companies pledged they would not scrap the deal with Altice.  T-Mobile also promised that the new company would build a \u201cworld-leading 5G\u201d network, the next generation of wireless service, to give rural Americans robust 5G broadband and enhance home broadband.  T-Mobile had said the companies were extending a deadline to complete their deal to July 29. The two are among just four national wireless carriers, with Verizon Communications and AT&T Inc leading the pack.  The FCC and Justice Department had been expected to make a decision in early June. They have been weighing a potential loss of competition, and subsequently higher prices for consumers, against the prospect of a more powerful No. 3 wireless carrier that can build a faster, better 5G network.

SoftBank has agreed to surrender about 48.8 million T-Mobile shares acquired in the merger to the new company after the deal closes, changing the exchange ratio to 11 Sprint shares for each T-Mobile share, higher than the originally agreed 9.75 shares.  Sprint shareholders other than SoftBank will continue to receive the original exchange ratio.  SoftBank can get the shares back if the combined company hits stock price milestones, the companies said without disclosing the details.  Sources said SoftBank agreed to the change to avoid delaying the close of the merger. If the ratio for the Sprint common shareholders was changed, a new fairness opinion and a shareholder vote may have been required, which could have delayed the close by four months.

Last week, a federal judge approved the merger deal, rejecting a claim by a group of states that said the proposed transaction would violate antitrust laws and raise prices.

T-Mobile, in which Deutsche Telekom owns a 63% stake, and Sprint, controlled by Japan's Softbank 9984.T have offered a series of concessions, including divesting T-Mobile's Boost prepaid brand and a slab of spectrum to alleviate DoJ concerns on market dominance.  The merger would reduce the number of market players from four to three, which critics say would leave consumers facing less choice and higher prices.  To address that, the parties have held talks with Dish DISH.O on enabling the cable TV company's entry into the mobile market, but the talks have dragged as the two sides haggle over restrictions on the further sale of the assets.  Deutsche Telekom was not immediately available for comment.  The DoJ told T-Mobile US and Sprint Corp earlier this month to wrap up a deal by the end of this week to sell assets that are to be divested as a condition for their tie-up, or face a lawsuit aimed at stopping the transaction.  In June, a group of U.S. state attorneys general filed a lawsuit in federal court in New York to block the merger, arguing it would cost consumers more than $4.5 billion annually.  The suit is backed by the Communications Workers of America labor union which says the deal would result in heavy job losses.","193":"WASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) - The chief executives of T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp, which are seeking to merge, head back to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to defend their planned $26 billion deal.  T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere and Marcelo Claure, executive chairman of Sprint, will be the stars among the six witnesses who testify before the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee\u2019s Antitrust subcommittee. Legere said during a run in Washington on Sunday that he posted on Twitter that he was \u201creally looking forward\u201d to the hearing.  The agreement to combine the No. 3 and No. 4 U.S. wireless carriers, struck in April, was approved by both companies\u2019 shareholders in October and has received national security clearance, but needs approval from the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission.  It had been contemplated several years ago, but officials in President Barack Obama\u2019s administration urged the companies to drop the idea, which they did.  The deal is unpopular with some lawmakers. Eight progressive senators signed a letter asking the Trump administration to reject the deal, including presidential candidates Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren.  To win support for the deal, T-Mobile previously said it would not increase prices for three years. Sprint said it hopes to complete the regulatory approval process by the end of June.  The committee said it would examine the deal\u2019s potential impact on consumers, workers and the internet.  Lawmakers will likely ask about a report that Legere and other company leaders have spent $195,000 on hotel stays and other expenses at the Trump International Hotel in Washington since the company sought approval for the deal.  Asked on Twitter where he was staying, Legere said, \u201cTrump Hotel? No. I\u2019m staying at the Willard.\u201d  The FCC said last week that it had halted the informal 180-day \u201cshot clock\u201d on the merger review to give the public more time to comment on significant new information from the companies. It said it expects to resume the \u201cshot clock,\u201d at the current Day 122 on April 4.  The deal has run into criticism from unions, consumer advocates and rural operators. The Communications Workers of America has said the deal will eliminate tens of thousands of jobs.  Last month at a congressional hearing, House Democrats raised worries about the deal because the U.S. wireless market has just four main carriers. The industry leaders are AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc.  To defend the proposed transaction, Legere pointed to the company\u2019s history of aggressive pricing, said it would need 11,000 new employees by 2024 and pledged to building the next generation of wireless, called 5G, without equipment from Huawei Technologies Co Ltd or ZTE Corp, two Chinese telecommunications firms distrusted by U.S. national security experts.

T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere and Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure met with Pai on Tuesday after meeting last week with FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, and Commissioner Mike O\u2019Rielly, a Republican. The pair also met with Republican FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr on Tuesday, a person briefed on the matter said.  Company officials told the FCC last week they expected to file a formal application with the commission by the end of May. Claure said last week they had also had meetings with the Justice Department.  The FCC must determine if the merger is in the public interest, while the Justice Department must determine if the merger of the third- and fourth-largest U.S. carriers would harm competition. Consumer groups have complained the deal would lead to higher prices, hitting low-income people the hardest and leaving them fewer alternatives for communication.  Pai\u2019s predecessor, Tom Wheeler, said in 2014 it was \u201cgood for consumers\u201d to have four carriers to choose from, while Pai declined to say in May 2017 if he thought four carriers was the right number of competitors.  Shareholders of Sprint, controlled by Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T, would get $6.62 for every share held. Deutsche Telekom AG DTEGn.DE, T-Mobile\u2019s majority owner, would own 42 percent and control the board of the combined company.

U.S. state attorneys general, led by New York and California, are suing to stop the merger.  The states seek to prove in Manhattan federal court that the deal between the No. 3 and No. 4 wireless carriers would raise prices, particularly for users on prepaid plans. The state attorneys general, all Democrats, asked Judge Victor Marrero to order the companies to abandon the deal.  Sprint Chief Marketing Officer Roger Sole testified that the company\u2019s strategy for enticing customers from competitors included slashing prices.  But he said the promotion\u2019s \u201cearly success faded away pretty soon\u201d due to customers having a negative experience with Sprint\u2019s network quality.  In an effort to show how competition lowered prices, the states presented evidence that when Sprint introduced an aggressive promotion in 2016 to offer phone plans comparable to those of Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile, T-Mobile\u2019s MetroPCS prepaid brand immediately lowered prices on its plans.  The evidence is central to the states\u2019 argument that Sprint and T-Mobile as standalone companies force competition between carriers, providing the best deal for consumers.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  Lawyers for the states also presented evidence suggesting Sprint wanted a deal so more money could be earned from each customer.  In WhatsApp messages from 2017 between Sole and Marcelo Claure, who was then CEO of Sprint, Sole suggested a merger with T-Mobile could raise Sprint\u2019s average revenue per user by $5.  In his deposition before the trial, Sole said he was simply offering a thought that price increases could happen \u201cvery far down the road.\u201d  The companies argue that the stronger T-Mobile that would result from the proposed $26.5 billion takeover would be better able to innovate and compete to reduce wireless prices. The case represents a break with the usual process of states coordinating with the federal government in reviewing mergers and generally coming to a joint conclusion.  The deal had been contemplated in 2014 during the Obama administration, but the Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission urged the companies to drop it, which they did.  The Trump administration signed off on it after the companies agreed to sell Sprint\u2019s prepaid businesses, popular with people with poor credit, to satellite television company Dish Network Corp.  But setting up DISH as a wireless carrier is \u201cpatently insufficient to mitigate the merger\u2019s competitive harm,\u201d the states argued in a court filing.

A group of U.S. states have sued to stop the merger, saying it would lead to higher prices.  T-Mobile and Sprint have already received approval for the deal from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), after the companies agreed to sell Sprint\u2019s prepaid phone business and some spectrum to satellite TV provider Dish, which has committed to building a nationwide wireless network and becoming a competitor in the industry.  The states have argued that Dish has a history of stockpiling FCC licenses for wireless spectrum, or airwaves that carry data, and has not yet demonstrated that it can build a wireless network.  Legere was the defense\u2019s first witness, and his testimony came on the fifth day of a trial that is expected to run until Dec. 20. He has previously accused Dish of \u201choarding\u201d spectrum.

The case had been expected to be heard beginning on Oct. 7, and was expected to last two to three weeks. It is now set for Dec. 9.  Under the Justice Department deal announced a week ago, the companies would divest Sprint\u2019s prepaid businesses, including Boost Mobile, to satellite television company Dish Network Corp, and provide it with access to 20,000 cell sites and hundreds of retail locations. That deal is worth about $5 billion.  Prepaid wireless phones are generally used by lower-income earners who cannot pass a credit check.  The states involved in the lawsuit have said that the divestiture negotiated by the federal government to position Dish as a fourth wireless carrier was inadequate to protect consumers.  The state attorneys general asked for 150 total hours for deposition, while T-Mobile and Sprint argued it should be limited to 60. Lehrburger ruled that the states would have 140 hours to depose potential witnesses.

REUTERS\/Wolfgang Rattay  The U.S. Department of Justice approved the deal, which was struck more than a year ago, after T-Mobile agreed to sell Sprint's prepaid business to satellite TV firm Dish Network Corp DISH.O to create a fourth U.S. wireless carrier.  However, a lawsuit filed by over a dozen U.S. states seeking to halt the deal is still outstanding and although Deutsche Telekom - which owns 63% of T-Mobile - is open to a settlement, it said it expects the case to go to trial in December.  The merger of the No.3 and No.4 U.S. mobile players would create a business accounting for more than three fifths of group revenue at Deutsche Telekom, which is the leader in its home market and has a broad European presence.  \u201cOur plans to build a bigger, stronger T-Mobile remain unchanged - even after the conditions agreed with the DoJ,\u201d CEO Tim Hoettges told reporters, adding he still expected the merger to yield the cost savings originally envisaged.  Deutsche Telekom earlier reported in-line second-quarter results with revenue up 2.9% and core profits rising 3.5% on an underlying basis. It confirmed guidance for profits to reach 23.9 billion euros ($26.8 billion) this year.  U.S. STRENGTH  T-Mobile, which has already reported results, led growth with a 5.1% increase in dollar revenues. Germany lagged with weakness in its consumer internet business and costs related to network upgrades.  The so-called IP migration, which is costing hundreds of millions of euros per year, has prompted some customers to cancel contracts rather than upgrade. German revenues rose by just 1.2% in the quarter.  Some analysts picked up on that weakness, and Deutsche Telekom shares traded 0.8% weaker in Frankfurt. They are down 2% year to date, just outperforming the European sector index .SXKP.  Hoettges told reporters that the IP migration would be completed for retail customers by the end of 2019 and for business customers in the first half of 2020.  Updating on the restructuring of troubled IT services arm T-Systems, Hoettges said a recent decision to bundle telecoms services for both large and small business customers at Deutsche Telekom would be good for clients and revenues.  He also said plans to carve out T-Systems\u2019 cybersecurity and industrial internet businesses would position them as profit and growth centers, rather than service organizations. The units were not for sale, he added.  The further shakeup at T-Systems, where CEO Adel Al-Saleh has already let go thousands of staff in a restructuring exercise, will be put to Deutsche Telekom\u2019s supervisory board for approval.","202":"WASHINGTON\/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Concessions by T-Mobile US Inc to win U.S. government approval to buy Sprint Corp will likely lead to higher prices for the poorest Americans, many of whom use prepaid wireless plans, analysts and activists said.  The more expensive prepaid plans, used by people who lack the good credit to qualify for a cheaper postpaid plan means low-income users will have less access to the internet for job hunts and job applications, and for children to do homework, activists say. With postpaid, people pay with credit cards or monthly bank withdrawals.  Cost matters. Pew Research Center found in 2015 that 48% of the people they polled had to cancel or shut off their cell phone service for at least a short time because they could not afford it.  T-Mobile and Sprint said on Monday they would sell Sprint\u2019s Boost Mobile business, which sells prepaid plans, and ensure that the divested company has access to a wireless network for six years.  The offer was enough for Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai to agree to support the proposed transaction, he said on Monday. The two other Republican commissioners indicated they would also back the deal, giving it the needed three votes out of five.  The U.S. Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division staff has recommended the agency block the deal, leaving the decision up to political appointees.  Free Press, an advocacy group, urged the Justice Department to block the acquisition, saying it will exacerbate an existing \u201caffordability crisis\u201d that makes it hard for poorer people to get online, said its general counsel, Matt Wood.  \u201cPeople who rely on prepaid services won\u2019t see any benefits from the conditions the FCC is touting.\u201d  Sprint and T-Mobile customers were likely to see weighted average prices rise a minimum of 4.2% for prepaid services and 4.8% for postpaid, satellite television provider Dish Network Corp, a critic of the deal, said in an FCC filing last year. Currently Boost offers four lines with unlimited data, talk and text for $100 per month.  A T-Mobile store is pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York, New York, U.S., May 20, 2019. REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri  Prepaid service is often favored by poorer people because there is no need to pass a credit check.  Selling Boost Mobile, one of three brands that Sprint uses to provide prepaid wireless service, will do little to bring down market concentration in that market, said Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson LLC.  Moffett put T-Mobile\u2019s prepaid market share at 41% and Sprint at 17%, giving them 58% if they were to merge without divestitures. It is not known how much of Sprint\u2019s market share comes from Boost.  Boost would rely on the combined company to provide spectrum and network access for at least six years.  Boost operates using Sprint\u2019s spectrum and network. Under the companies\u2019 proposal, only the brand will be sold and it will remain dependent on Sprint for spectrum and network access.  If the spectrum to support Boost is divested, \u201cthat would then qualify (Boost) as a real competitor and not be dependent on somebody else\u2019s network,\u201d said Roger Entner, a telecommunications analyst with Recon Analytics.  Entner argued that Boost has seen better days.  \u201cBoost recently lost their distribution at Target, and Best Buy is redoing the way it sells wireless. A huge part of Boost\u2019s distribution is either falling away or changing the way they do business, none of which are good signs for Boost,\u201d he added.  Sprint would retain its Sprint brand prepaid business and Virgin Mobile, another prepaid brand. T-Mobile would keep Metro, its prepaid business.  Sprint\u2019s prepaid subscriber base had been shrinking but has turned around and has been growing for more than two years, with Boost expanding and Virgin Mobile losing subscribers, according to Sprint filings with the government.  Despite the Boost sale, the activist group Public Knowledge said the poor would pay more, especially after T-Mobile\u2019s 6-year commitment to Boost expires.  \u201cThe low-income and prepaid consumers who have turned to lower cost (providers) will likely be forced to pay higher prices post-merger as a combined T-Mobile\/Sprint exercise their market power to raise wholesale prices,\u201d the group said in a statement.  Sprint shares fell nearly 9% to $6.58, while T-Mobile fell 1.2% to $76.21.","203":"(Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.O on Thursday added more phone subscribers than analysts had expected in the third quarter, as demand for its services picked up with people staying at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  Shares of T-Mobile rose 7.75%% to $126.35 in after-hours trading.  The U.S. wireless carrier has been racing to expand its next generation 5G network and integrate Sprint\u2019s wireless network after it purchased its smaller rival in April.  T-Mobile\u2019s 5G network quality is expected to surpass larger rival Verizon Communications Inc, and it continues to have the lowest prices in the industry, said Craig Moffett, an analyst with research firm MoffettNathanson, in a note on Thursday.  T-Mobile added a net 689,000 so-called postpaid phone customers during the quarter ended Sept. 30, above analyst estimates of 422,000, according to research firm FactSet.  Analysts and investors closely watch postpaid phone figures, as those customers pay a recurring monthly bill, making them valuable to the carriers.  Total revenue rose to $19.27 billion (\u00a314.66 billion) from $11.06 billion in the year-ago quarter, beating analyst estimates of $18.34 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  T-Mobile\u2019s net income rose to $1.25 billion, or $1.00 per share, in the third quarter, from $870 million, or $1.01 per share, a year earlier.  The wireless carrier increased its guidance for the second half of 2020, and said it now expects postpaid phone net customer additions to be between 1.3 million and 1.4 million, including 600,000 to 700,000 in the fourth quarter.  The previous H2 guidance of 1.7 million to 1.9 million in total postpaid net customer additions, which includes phones and other devices like tablets, was achieved during the third quarter.  Still, the fourth quarter guidance was \u201ccautious\u201d given there are still business uncertainties due to the pandemic, said T-Mobile Chief Executive Mike Sievert on an earnings call with analysts.","204":"(Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc is preparing an alternative plan if a deal to sell wireless assets to Dish Network Corp falls through, according to two sources familiar with the matter.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc , which is advising T-Mobile, the third largest U.S. wireless carrier, on selling prepaid brand Boost Mobile as part of the company\u2019s concession to gain regulatory approval to buy Sprint Corp, is expected to send out books to prospective buyers in two weeks, one source familiar with the matter said.  While satellite television provider Dish Network remains the front-runner to acquire the Boost assets, Goldman has told prospective buyers as late as Tuesday that it is preparing for an upcoming auction of Boost.  Another source characterized the process being run by Goldman as moving slowly. Among the details holding up an auction is that Goldman is not yet clear what exactly is up for sale from the merger, one source said.  T-Mobile and Sprint did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.  T-Mobile and Sprint have agreed to a series of deal concessions, including to sell Boost, to gain regulatory approval for the $26.5 billion merger with Sprint, but still needs the green light from the U.S. Department of Justice antitrust chief, though his staff have recommended the agency block the deal.  A source close to the discussions said T-Mobile was hopeful it would reach an agreement with the Justice Department by early next week.  The Boost assets have stirred up interest from a variety of parties, including Amazon.com Inc and cable companies Comcast Corp , Charter Communications Inc and Altice USA Inc, according to sources.  T-Mobile and Sprint are still negotiating possible additional concessions with the Department of Justice, and Goldman Sachs is waiting for the details of the agreement before working on the terms that will be sent out to bidders, one source said.  Two potential bidders told Reuters on the condition of anonymity that they are still in the dark about critical information related to the Boost sale, such as how the Boost wireless deal with T-Mobile will be structured, or financial details about the Boost customers, which the bidders will use to determine the prepaid brand\u2019s valuation.  Dish is also speaking with other parties on potential partnerships with Boost, sources said.  T-Mobile has agreed to negotiate a contract with Boost\u2019s buyer that will allow the spun-off company to run on the combined T-Mobile and Sprint network, according to a regulatory filing that outlined the merger concessions. But the carriers are currently debating whether to provide the buyer an infrastructure-based mobile virtual network operator deal, which would allow the buyer more control over the wireless plans, including control of the user\u2019s SIM card, one source said.  That could help convince the Department of Justice to approve the merger, which has held discussions on how to preserve competition in the wireless industry.  Cable provider Altice is one of the few so-called MVNO partners to have this type of wireless agreement, which it currently has with Sprint. An infrastructure-based MVNO is generally seen as more favorable than a standard deal that allows wireless providers that do not own and operate their own network to piggyback off of one of the four major wireless carriers for wholesale prices.  Other concessions being discussed include whether T-Mobile and Sprint will divest wireless spectrum, or the airwaves that carry data, and the possibility of giving up more retail customers or retail shops from either T-Mobile or Sprint\u2019s prepaid brands, according to one source familiar with the matter.","205":"FILE PHOTO: A smartphones with Sprint logo are seen in front of a screen projection of T-mobile logo, in this picture illustration taken April 30, 2018.

A trial date has been set for Dec. 9.  The U.S. Justice Department approved the deal in July.  Under the Justice Department deal, the companies would divest Sprint's prepaid businesses, including Boost Mobile, to satellite television company Dish Network Corp DISH.O, and provide it with access to 20,000 cell sites and hundreds of retail locations.

But Representative Hank Johnson, a Democrat from Georgia, asked instead about Legere taking a group of executives to stay at the Trump International Hotel the day after the merger was announced last year.

Beau Buffier, an attorney in the New York attorney general\u2019s office, said Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Nevada will be included in an amended complaint being filed Friday.  Lawyers for the states and wireless companies also proposed Oct. 7 for the start of the trial, which could last two to three weeks.","232":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York on Sunday dropped its fight against the $40 billion merger of U.S. wireless carriers T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.O and Sprint Corp S.N, saying the state would not appeal a judge's approval of the deal.  New York Attorney General Letitia James said her office would end the court challenge to the 2018 merger agreement between the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers.  Instead, she said her office hopes \u201cto work with all the parties to ensure that consumers get the best pricing and service possible, that networks are built out throughout our state, and that good-paying jobs are created here in New York.\u201d  A U.S. federal judge gave the companies the green light on Tuesday to complete the deal. New York, California and other states had challenged it on antitrust grounds, saying it would drive up prices for consumers.  The office of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said it was reviewing the court ruling and its options.  \u201cWe are mindful that the California Public Utility Commission also has this matter under consideration,\u201d it said on Sunday.  Attorneys general offices for Connecticut and Massachusetts said they are reviewing the decision and evaluating their options. Michigan said it was not in a position to comment.  The eight other states in the group and the District of Columbia did not reply to requests for comment.  In her statement, New York\u2019s James said the \u201cprocess has yielded commitments from T-Mobile to create jobs in Rochester and engage in robust national diversity initiatives that will connect our communities with good jobs and technology.\u201d  Other states have also stopped pursing their fight by focusing on jobs they were promised. In October, Colorado became the second state, after Mississippi, to drop its legal challenge after striking an agreement with T-Mobile and Dish Network Corp DISH.O, which will buy the assets divested from the merger.  Dish pledged to bring 2,000 jobs to Colorado, and T-Mobile agreed to deploy the next generation of wireless 5G across much of the state.  No further details were immediately available on any such specific agreement with New York.  The all-stock deal was originally valued at $26 billion. With gains in the value of T-Mobile shares since it was announced, the deal is now worth $40 billion.","233":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - One influential analyst called Amazon.com\u2019s reported interest in the U.S. wireless market \u201cbatshit crazy.\u201d Another said it was a \u201ctrojan horse\u201d to kill off the big wireless players.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  What\u2019s becoming clear to the people who track the company is the ambitions of the world\u2019s largest online retailer\u2019s go far beyond replacing your phone service.  Amazon is interested in acquiring Boost Mobile, which will be sold by U.S. wireless carriers T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp as part of plans to win regulatory approval of their proposed $26.5 billion merger, primarily because a purchase would include a six-year contract that allows access to the combined company\u2019s wireless network, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing a source familiar with the matter.  The ambition signaled that Amazon is looking to dive deeper into the wireless industry, strengthen its cloud services and ultimately take advantage of the next-generation 5G networks that are expected to transform major facets of technology, according to analysts.  That means the tech giant, which has evolved from a mere bookseller to a superstore of physical and digital products, could be setting its sights on taking on carriers such as AT&T Inc and strengthening itself against rival cloud providers like Microsoft.  Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Shares of Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T both closed down more than 4% on Friday.  The market assumes Amazon wants to become a wireless carrier itself, \u201cbut that thinking is too small,\u201d said Colby Synesael, an analyst with Cowen. Amazon\u2019s larger motivation could be that it expects 5G to be integral to cloud services in the future for industries like healthcare and autos, which will use 5G-enabled devices, he said.  These devices will connect to Amazon\u2019s cloud, which will store the data. If Amazon can control both the wireless network and the cloud, it can sell the full suite of products for customers who want to build 5G services, which would give it an advantage over competing cloud providers, he said.  Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar also saw a wide opportunity for Amazon. \u201cIn a 5G world, the opportunity from wireless for Amazon could include everything from managing warehouses \u2026 to reducing churn at Prime,\u201d he said in a research note to clients on Friday. Prime is Amazon\u2019s paid subscription service that includes free delivery and access to streaming music and video.  Amazon has dabbled in this arena before. A 2014 attempt to take on Apple\u2019s iPhone with the Fire Phone failed just a year later. In 2007 Amazon launched its free Whispernet 3G wireless service with the first Kindle reading device that let readers download books over the air. Last month, Amazon announced plans to launch over 3,000 satellites to provide internet access to rural areas around the world.  WIRELESS BUSINESS  If Amazon decides to compete as a more traditional wireless provider, \u201cthe impact for the wireless carriers, and particularly Verizon and AT&T, would be bleak,\u201d said Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with New Street Research. \u201cThey are happy to accept losses for years in order to eventually own a market,\u201d he said.  Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson, the analyst who called the idea of Amazon\u2019s wanting to enter wireless \u201cbatshit crazy,\u201d said the prospect of Amazon wanting \u201cto operate their own proprietary network for such purposes is economically insane.\u201d  The sheer cost of attempting to build a national network would be an obstacle, he said, noting that Verizon and AT&T have each spent some $120 billion on their networks in the last decade alone.  T-Mobile and Sprint offered a series of concessions last week, including to sell Boost, in order to gain approval for the merger. The Federal Communications Commission has given the green light, the deal still needs approval from the U.S. Department of Justice.","234":"FILE PHOTO: A smartphone with Sprint logo are seen in front of a screen projection of T-mobile logo, in this picture illustration taken April 30, 2018.

(Reporting by Edward Taylor and Douglas Busvine)","239":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc won U.S. antitrust approval for its $26 billion takeover of rival Sprint Corp, the Justice Department said Friday, clearing a major hurdle to a deal that merges the nation\u2019s third and fourth largest wireless carriers.  The companies have agreed to divest Sprint\u2019s prepaid businesses, including Boost Mobile, to satellite television firm Dish Network Corp to create a fourth U.S. wireless carrier.  The Justice Department indicated the deal would improve competition and the rollout of faster 5G networks by combining weaker players and creating a strong, new No. 4, in Dish, that has unused spectrum, which can be activated. Critics, including some state attorneys general, say competition won\u2019t increase and prices for mobile phone plans will rise.  The deal is a clear success for T-Mobile Chief Executive Officer John Legere, who will be the CEO of the combined company and who pushed back at critics arguing a more concentrated market would lead to higher prices.  \u201cIt\u2019s a bit dumbfounding to think that we\u2019ve decided to go and build this network and go through this merger so that we can become the basic, lazy, fat, dumb and arrogant players that we were born to teach how to behave,\u201d he told analysts in a conference call.  Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, said the deal would hasten the development of 5G, the next generation of wireless.  Shares of T-Mobile, which is about 63 percent owned by Deutsche Telekom AG, were up 5.3% at $84.17. Shares of Sprint, which is about 84 percent owned by Softbank Group Corp, rose 7.1% to $7.97. Dish was up 0.7% at $39.44.  But the deal still faces a significant challenge: A group of U.S. state attorneys general, including from New York and California, have sued to block the merger on antitrust grounds, arguing the proposed deal would cost consumers more than $4.5 billion annually.  New York State Attorney General Letitia James indicated the lawsuit would continue, at least in part because of what critics see as Dish\u2019s failure to live up to pledges it had made.  A smartphones with Sprint logo are seen in front of a screen projection of T-mobile logo, in this picture illustration taken April 30, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  \u201cWe have serious concerns that cobbling together this new fourth mobile player, with the government picking winners and losers, will not address the merger\u2019s harm to consumers, workers, and innovation,\u201d she said.  The Justice Department, backed by five state attorneys general, said the deal required the merging companies to sell Virgin Mobile and Sprint\u2019s prepaid business and provide Dish with access to 20,000 cell sites and hundreds of retail locations.  Prepaid wireless phones are generally sought by lower-income people who cannot pass a credit check.  Dish has agreed to acquire spectrum, or airwaves that carry data, in a deal valued at $3.6 billion from the merged firm and pay $1.4 billion for Sprint\u2019s prepaid business that serves about 9.3 million customers. Dish will get access to the new T-Mobile\u2019s network for seven years while it builds its own 5G network.  T-Mobile and Dish are also required to work out a deal where T-Mobile can use Dish\u2019s unused 600 MHz spectrum and the companies are required to use eSIM, which allows consumers to switch easily between carriers, a Justice Department official said.  SKEPTICAL LAWMAKERS  T-Mobile competes with Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc T.N.  U.S. consumers tend to stick with one mobile carrier for years, giving companies a steady stream of cash. As more people rely on cell phones for social media, banking or news and entertainment, the lines have blurred between telecom, content and cable companies, just as so-called 5G technology promises to make mobile phones even more powerful.  Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement on Friday he would soon circulate a formal order supporting the deal. The FCC could vote on final approval in August or September, officials said.  The FCC agreed to give Dish more time to use spectrum it previously acquired. The company could face up to $2.2 billion in penalties and lose its spectrum licenses if it fails to meet its commitments to build its network, according to a letter filed Friday with the FCC. Dish must have a 5G network covering at least 70% of the U.S. population no later than June 14, 2023.  Dish has spent years stockpiling wireless spectrum and faced a looming March 2020 deadline to build a product using the spectrum in order to fulfill its license requirements.  Some senior lawmakers remained skeptical about the merger, including Senators Mike Lee, a Republican, and Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, the top lawmakers on the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee.  Lee said he was hopeful the divestiture would succeed but uneasy about Dish\u2019s dual role as a critic of the transaction and a buyer of divested assets.  Klobuchar, who is running for president, reiterated that she had wanted the deal stopped. \u201cIt looked like a bad deal then, and it looks like a bad deal today, despite the parties\u2019 promises and this proposed consent decree,\u201d she said.","240":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said on Thursday it has halted the informal 180-day \u201cshot clock\u201d on the review of the merger of wireless providers Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc to give the public three additional weeks to comment on the $26 billion tie-up.  A sign for a T-Mobile store is seen in Manhattan, New York, U.S., April 30, 2018. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  The FCC said the decision was made after the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers had filed significant additional information on their network integration plans for 2019-2021 and other new information on the merger.  The FCC said it typically allows for additional public input after \u201csubstantial new submissions\u201d by the applicants. The FCC said it expects to resume the \u201cshot clock,\u201d at the current Day 122 on April 4.  T-Mobile and Sprint in separate statements called the FCC decision \u201ca positive step\u201d that the FCC is \u201cso deeply engaged in understanding this transaction and our recent filing, and we completely understand their desire\u201d to stop the clock \u201cto fully review the merits of our merger.\u201d  Sprint said it hopes to complete the regulatory approval process by the end of June.  The deal to combine the carriers, struck in April 2018, was approved by both companies\u2019 shareholders in October and has received national security clearance, but still needs approval from the Department of Justice and the FCC. A number of state attorneys general are also reviewing the merger.  Last month at a congressional hearing, House Democrats raised worries about the deal because the U.S. wireless market has just four main carriers. The industry leaders are AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc.  T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere defended the deal, arguing that it will create jobs and help with the construction of the next generation of wireless networks. He said the merged company would have more capacity which would lead to a push to lower prices.  Legere and Sprint Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure will testify at another U.S. House hearing on March 12.  The deal has run into criticism from unions, consumer advocates, and rural operators.  The Communications Workers of America said in a statement Thursday the decision of the companies to file new analyses of the merger suggests they \u201chave failed to persuade regulators.\u201d The union argues the deal will eliminate tens of thousands of jobs.  A group of eight Democratic U.S. senators and independent Senator Bernie Sanders last month urged regulators to reject the deal, saying monthly bills could rise as much as 10 percent.","241":"TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T stock surged to its highest price in over half a year in Tokyo on Wednesday, after a U.S. federal judge rejected an antitrust challenge to the proposed takeover of subsidiary Sprint Corp S.N by T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.O.  FILE PHOTO: People walk behind the logo of SoftBank Corp in Tokyo December 18, 2014. REUTERS\/Toru Hanai  The ruling brings the Japanese technology conglomerate a significant step closer to slashing its exposure to a troubled asset at a time when other major bets face investor scepticism, and as it struggles to find backing for a successor to its $100 billion Vision Fund.  \u201cThis is obviously great news for Sprint... It is better news for SoftBank,\u201d analyst Kirk Boodry at Redex Holdings wrote in a note on the Smartkarma platform.  A deal would remove the risk of SoftBank having to inject further funds into Sprint, though T-Mobile may push for better terms given Sprint\u2019s relative weakness, Boodry wrote.  Sprint is one of SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son\u2019s biggest overseas investments with Japanese ownership reaching 84%, but the U.S. wireless carrier has struggled to compete with larger rivals, weighing down the group.  It has long been linked with a merger with rival T-Mobile - leaving SoftBank with a minority stake - and on Tuesday, a federal judge rejected a claim by a group of states that such a tie-up would violate antitrust laws or raise prices.  The ruling sent Sprint shares soaring 78%, while those of T-Mobile climbed 12%. SoftBank saw its shares open 12.5% higher in Tokyo on Wednesday, ending morning trade up 13.7% at 5,843 yen.  The Japanese firm reports its earnings later on Wednesday, with Son speaking at an earnings briefing from 0700 GMT.  Analysts on average expect SoftBank to report a 20% on-year fall in operating profit for the October-December quarter, weighed down by the performance of some of its Vision Fund\u2019s tech bets.  SHAREHOLDER VALUE  The ruling is the latest news to boost SoftBank stock, which has risen 20% year-to-date, after sources last week told Reuters that activist hedge fund Elliott Management has amassed a stake of almost $3 billion in SoftBank and is pushing for change at the firm including $20 billion in stock buybacks.  Under pressure to boost shareholder value, SoftBank is likely to launch a share buyback this month, Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a note. The purchases should be funded by a partial sale of SoftBank's 26% stake in Chinese e-commerce major Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA.N, Goyal said.  Son previously dipped into the stake - which is currently worth $150 billion - selling Alibaba shares ahead of the 2016 acquisition of British chip designer Arm.  SoftBank won big with Alibaba but has fared less well with its massive bets on U.S. office-sharing company WeWork and ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc UBER.N, and is struggling to raise outside capital for a second Vision Fund.

The merger between T-Mobile and Sprint had been expected to get an all clear from CFIUS after sources told Reuters on Friday that the firms\u2019 respective foreign owners, Deutsche Telekom AG and Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Ltd, had offered to stop using Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] equipment.  People familiar with the deal said last week that U.S. officials had pressured Deutsche Telekom to stop using Huawei gear, and the companies believed they had to comply to win approval from CFIUS, headed by the Treasury Department.  Many governments around the world have shut out the Chinese firm amid worries its gear could facilitate Chinese spying. While T-Mobile and Sprint do not use Huawei equipment, Deutsche Telekom and SoftBank use some Huawei gear in overseas markets.  T-Mobile and Sprint, the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers, said on Monday that Team Telecom, in a filing with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), indicated it had no objections to the merger after reviewing \u201cpotential national security, law enforcement, and public safety issues.\u201d  \u201cWe are pleased to achieve both of these important milestones in the journey to build the New T-Mobile,\u201d T-Mobile CEO John Legere said in a statement.

A group of state attorneys general, led by New York and California, are suing to stop the $26.5 billion merger between the wireless carriers, arguing it would lead to higher prices.  Timotheus H\u00f6ttges, who is chairman of T-Mobile\u2019s board, testified that T-Mobile sought to merge with its smaller rival to increase scale and gain wireless spectrum, or airwaves that carry data, but denied the goal was to reduce competition. His testimony came on the second day of a trial that is expected to run until Dec. 20.  Attorneys for the states presented evidence on Tuesday from a T-Mobile board presentation in 2010, when the company first explored a deal with Sprint, that said the merger would have \u201cpotential to reduce price competition.\u201d  H\u00f6ttges downplayed the presentation, saying it had been prepared by advisers and was not an official Deutsche Telekom document.  T-Mobile and Sprint have already received approval for the deal from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission, after the companies agreed to sell Sprint\u2019s prepaid phone business and some spectrum to satellite TV provider Dish Network Corp.  The companies argue that a stronger T-Mobile would result from the proposed takeover, making it better able to innovate and compete to reduce wireless prices. The case represents a break with the usual process of states coordinating with the federal government in reviewing mergers and generally coming to a joint conclusion.  The states have argued that Dish is not a viable competitor in the wireless market that could replace Sprint as the fourth-largest carrier. On Tuesday, Glenn Pomerantz, an attorney representing California in the lawsuit, asked H\u00f6ttges whether he was aware that Dish had repeatedly failed to build a network using its vast holdings of wireless spectrum.  H\u00f6ttges testified that Dish founder and Chairman Charlie Ergen was \u201cnot easy to deal with,\u201d but said Ergen was known for being a great entrepreneur and would have all the ingredients needed to build a network once the merger closed.","250":"DALLAS\/NEW YORK\/LONDON\/HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Corona Capital is a daily column updated throughout the day by Breakingviews columnists around the world with short, sharp pandemic-related insights.

James also said her office did not notify Justice before the states filed the lawsuit, adding it was not required for them to do so.

The companies have also offered to sell Boost to reduce the combined company\u2019s market share in the prepaid business. They have also indicated they were considering divesting wireless spectrum.  The states\u2019 complaint also said that divesting Boost would not resolve competitive concerns since Boost would be dependent on another carrier to provide network access, meaning that it is not independent.

T-Mobile added a net 774,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill during the third quarter, up from 595,000 net new subscribers it added in the same quarter last year.  The results were well ahead of analyst expectations for 628,000 net new subscribers, according to research firm FactSet.  The growth was helped by new wireless plans aimed at certain users, such as those over 55 and people in the military, which helped T-Mobile gain new customer segments.  T-Mobile said it now expects to add 3.8 million to 4.1 million net new postpaid customers for the full year, up from its previous expectations of between 3 million to 3.6 million.  Wall Street analysts watch the so-called \u201cpostpaid\u201d customer figure, because those users pay a recurring bill and are more valuable to the carriers.  Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with NewStreet Research, said the results were very strong.  \u201cThey are gaining traction in new market segments and new geographies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think they have a long way to run.\u201d  T-Mobile\u2019s revenue rose to $10.84 billion from $10.02 billion, beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $10.72 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  Its net income rose to $795 million, or 93 cents a share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $550 million, or 63 cents a share, a year earlier.  The company said net income was impacted during the quarter by $53 million in costs related to the pending Sprint merger.  Analysts were expecting the company to report a profit of 85 cents per share.  Last week, the largest U.S. carrier Verizon reported adding a net 295,000 phone subscribers during the third quarter, beating estimates of 161,000 new subscribers. Separately, AT&T gained a net 69,000 phone subscribers, compared with analysts\u2019 estimates of a net drop of 22,000 subscribers.","267":"May 1 (Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc:  * QTRLY EPS OF $0.78  * QTRLY SERVICE REVENUES UP 6.5% TO $7.8 BILLION  * QTRLY TOTAL REVENUES UP 8.8% TO $10.5 BILLION  * 1.4 MILLION TOTAL NET ADDITIONS IN QUARTER  * Q1 EARNINGS PER SHARE VIEW $0.71, REVENUE VIEW $10.35 BILLION -- THOMSON REUTERS I\/B\/E\/S  * 1.0 MILLION TOTAL BRANDED POSTPAID NET ADDITIONS IN QUARTER  * INCREASED 2018 TARGET FOR BRANDED POSTPAID NET CUSTOMER ADDITIONS OF 2.6 TO 3.3 MILLION  * INCREASED 2018 ADJUSTED EBITDA TARGET OF $11.4 TO $11.8 BILLION INCLUDING LEASING REVENUES OF $0.6 TO $0.7 BILLION  * QTRLY BRANDED POSTPAID PHONE AVERAGE REVENUE PER USER WAS $46.66, UP 0.6% FROM Q4 2017 AND DOWN 1.8% FROM Q1 2017  * T-MOBILE - FOR 2018, CONTINUE TO EXPECT BRANDED POSTPAID PHONE ARPU TO BE GENERALLY STABLE VERSUS 2017, EX.

The agreement capped four years of on-and-off talks between the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers, setting the stage for the creation of a company with 127 million customers that will be a more formidable competitor to the top two wireless players, Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N and AT&T Inc T.N.  U.S. regulators, who have challenged in court AT&T's $85 billion deal to buy U.S. media company Time Warner Inc TWX.N, are expected to grill Sprint and T-Mobile on how they will price their combined wireless offerings.  Verizon has 116 million U.S. wireless customers, according to a spokesman, while AT&T has 93 million branded customers, as of the first quarter.  Their first round of merger talks ended unsuccessfully in 2014 after the administration of then-U.S. President Barack Obama expressed antitrust concerns.  The new deal will create the highest-capacity U.S. network, lower prices, create jobs and improve service in rural areas, said John Legere, the chief executive of T-Mobile and the new head of the proposed combined company.  The combined company, which will be called T-Mobile, will invest $40 billion over the next three years to upgrade its networks to accommodate the next generation 5G wireless technology, which is expected to have the speeds necessary to power drones and self-driving cars, Legere said in a statement.  The companies said during a conference call with analysts that the recent U.S. tax overhaul would have a positive impact, and the combined company would not be a significant taxpayer until 2025.  T-Mobile and Sprint said they expected to complete their deal no later than the first half of 2019, an ambitious goal given the intense U.S. regulatory scrutiny it will be subjected to. T-Mobile will not be liable to pay Sprint a breakup fee should regulators block the deal, according to sources who asked not to be identified because that detail in their contract had not yet been made public.  The companies said they expected U.S. regulators would see the benefits of the deal.  \u201cThis isn\u2019t a case of going from four to three wireless companies \u2013 there are now at least seven or eight big competitors in this converging market,\u201d Legere said, referring to cable companies as wireless competitors. Other companies also would be forced to accelerate their investments in the face of a combined T-Mobile-Sprint, the companies added.  A spokeswoman for Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai declined to comment on Sunday on the proposed merger. The FCC will decide whether to grant the deal regulatory approval if it is in the \u201cpublic interest,\u201d the spokeswoman added.  CTIA, a trade organization that represents the U.S. wireless communications industry, ranks the United States behind China and South Korea in 5G readiness. The Chinese government launched a plan targeting 5G deployment by 2020, with three carriers committed to the timeline.  Legere said the deal would likely lead to lower prices from AT&T and Verizon, as well as Comcast Corp CMCSA.O.  AT&T declined to comment. Comcast could not immediately be reached for comment.  Verizon declined to comment on prices but said it remained committed to building a 5G network.  Slideshow ( 7 images )  DEAL BREAKTHROUGH  The breakthrough in the companies' negotiations, first reported by Reuters on Thursday, came after T-Mobile majority-owner Deutsche Telekom AG DTEGn.DE and Japan's SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T, which controls Sprint, agreed on a structure that would allow Deutsche Telekom to continue to consolidate the combined company, which will have a market value of over $80 billion, on its books.  Deutsche Telekom will own 42 percent of the combined company, and will control the board of the combined company, nominating nine of the 14 directors. Legere will also serve as a director.  The implied equity valuation for Sprint is $6.62 per share based on T-Mobile\u2019s closing share price on Friday. Sprint shares closed on Friday at $6.50.  The all-stock transaction is at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.10256 T-Mobile shares for each Sprint share, or the equivalent of 9.75 Sprint shares for each T-Mobile US share.  Slideshow ( 7 images )  Tokyo-based SoftBank and Deutsche Telekom will sign a voting rights agreement that will give Deutsche Telekom access to voting rights for a total of 69 percent of T-Mobile shares.  The second round of talks between Sprint and T-Mobile ended in November over valuation disagreements.  Since then, Sprint\u2019s shares lost about a fifth of their value amid questions about how the company can compete effectively under the weight of its long-term debt of more than $32 billion.  T-Mobile\u2019s market capitalization is $54.7 billion, while Sprint is valued by the deal at $26 billion.  INVESTING IN 5G TECHNOLOGY  Even though Sprint\u2019s customer base has expanded under CEO Marcelo Claure, growth has been driven by discounting. Analysts say that without T-Mobile, Sprint lacks the scale needed to invest in its network and to compete in a saturated market.  T-Mobile has fared better than Sprint, even if it remains a distant third to Verizon and AT&T. It has managed to score sustained market-share gains, as innovative offerings, improving network performance and good customer service attract new customers, according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service Inc.  T-Mobile became the first major U.S. carrier to eliminate two-year contracts, a shift quickly embraced by consumers and copied by competitors. The company has also badgered rivals with its unlimited data plans.  Both Sprint and T-Mobile are far behind Verizon and AT&T in upgrading their network to accommodate next generation 5G wireless technology. Even after their merger, the combined company\u2019s budget to invest in 5G will be smaller than that of Verizon or AT&T.  Sprint and T-Mobile hope the deal will give them more firepower to participate in auction for spectrum to develop 5G. They plan to participate in a spectrum auction in late autumn and will request a waiver if the merger prevents the companies from participating.  PJT Partners, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Evercore served as advisers for T-Mobile. The Raine Group, J.P. Morgan and Centerview Partners LLC advised Sprint.","269":"(Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc\u2019s $26 billion deal to buy Sprint Inc banked on changes in wireless technology and media streaming to win U.S. antitrust approval, but the bet now looks precarious.  FILE PHOTO: A smartphones with Sprint logo are seen in front of a screen projection of T-mobile logo, in this picture illustration taken April 30, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  Growing skepticism from the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust staff over the impact of the merger on competition in the market will test the resolve of the companies to complete the deal that would see the top U.S. wireless carriers shrink to three from four.  While the Department of Justice has yet to reach a decision on whether to approve the deal, it is pushing Sprint and T-Mobile for evidence that the merger would be in the interest of U.S. consumers, people familiar with the matter said this week.  The deal would be the third major attempt in less than a decade to consolidate the U.S. wireless market, after AT&T Inc\u2019s $39 billion deal to buy T-Mobile in 2011 was blocked, and Sprint and T-Mobile abandoned a previous attempt to negotiate a merger in 2014 following regulatory opposition.  If completed, the deal would create a carrier with 127 million customers that will be a more formidable competitor to the No.1 and No.2 wireless players, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T, respectively.  \u201cIt is time to acknowledge that the odds of the deal are less than a coin toss,\u201d said Craig Moffett, a senior analyst at Moffett Nathanson, in a note.  Sprint shares are down more than 6 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported the merger is unlikely to be approved as currently structured, despite T-Mobile CEO John Legere tweeting that the premise of the story was \u201csimply untrue\u201d.  Sprint and T-Mobile are arguing that the U.S. wireless telecommunications industry has changed substantially since 2014, when they last attempted to merge.  The changes include the development of ultra-fast 5G networks, Sprint\u2019s struggles to operate on its own given its swelling debt load, and the marriage of telecommunications infrastructure with media production, as epitomized in AT&T\u2019s $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc.  These changes, as well as the companies\u2019 belief that the current Department of Justice antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, will take a more generous view of the deal than past leadership did, gave the two companies the confidence to take another shot at merging last year, they added.  Antitrust staff at the Department of Justice have taken a skeptical stance, however. They have been asking for more information about the extent of Sprint\u2019s challenges as a standalone company, the two companies\u2019 plans to merge their wireless network, and the benefits of the merger for the companies\u2019 planned 5G network buildout, the sources said.  T-Mobile has also been very efficient in cutting prices for consumers, and there are questions within the Department of Justice whether this would continue after a merger with Sprint, the sources added.  In a sign of the regulatory challenges facing the deal, T-Mobile and Sprint did not agree to any breakup fee should regulators scuttle the merger.  KEEPING UP WITH RIVALS  Sprint, which is majority owned by Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp, has struggled to keep pace with rivals, hemorrhaging cash and losing subscribers despite price cuts designed to keep pace with T-Mobile, which has been steadily gaining market share from rivals. T-Mobile is majority owned by Germany\u2019s Deutsche Telekom AG.  At the same time, China has poured vast amounts of money into the development of 5G networks, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to prioritize the rollout of the technology in the United States.  Meanwhile, AT&T\u2019s Time Warner deal, and Comcast Corp and Charter Communications Inc, which developed wireless offerings to compete with T-Mobile and Sprint, increased some telecommunication companies\u2019 ability to bundle wireless plans with other offerings, including streaming video content.  That has increased pressure on T-Mobile and Sprint to increase investment in their own networks, which they can afford to do more if they gain scale through the merger.  T-Mobile acquired cable company Layer3 TV in 2017 and rolled out its own television service in 2018. That combination of content and wireless plans, the companies have argued to regulators, could position a combined company as a more serious competitor to companies such as AT&T that offer bundled services.","270":"(Adds Democrats in Congress, seeking hearing, closing stock prices)  April 30 (Reuters) - Winning U.S. regulatory approval for a $26 billion tie-up of Sprint Corp and rival T-Mobile US Inc is the biggest hurdle to completing the deal, investors and analysts said on Monday.  Shares of Sprint closed down 13.7 percent at $5.61, and T-Mobile fell 6.2 percent to $60.51. Sprint\u2019s stock had gained 27 percent since April 10 following media reports that the companies restarted deal talks.  In situations with a risk that a deal will not win regulatory approval, stocks trade at a discount of 10 percent to 20 percent to the deal price, said Cowen analyst Colby Synesael.  Shareholders of Sprint, controlled by Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp, would get $6.62 for every share held. Deutsche Telekom AG, T-Mobile\u2019s majority owner, would own 42 percent and control the board of the combined company.  The Federal Communications Commission must review whether the transaction is in the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d A spokeswoman for FCC Chairman Ajit Pai declined to comment.  T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere is scheduled to meet with two FCC commissioners in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the deal, people briefed on the matter said.  Two top U.S. House Democrats on Tuesday asked for a hearing on the merger. Representatives Frank Pallone and Mike Doyle said in a statement the deal \u201ccould also trigger ripple effects for everyone who uses a mobile phone.\u201d  \u201cConsidering that the combined company would be overwhelmingly controlled by foreign entities, this transaction also raises significant questions about foreign control of major players in the U.S. wireless market,\u201d they said.  Macquarie Research said in a note that uncertainty could result in a wide spread in shares as a \u201cregulatory review\u201d could delay the deal\u2019s closing beyond the first half of 2019. \u201cThe regulatory backdrop is unpredictable,\u201d it added.  The Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has expressed opposition to \u201cbehavioral remedies,\u201d preferring structural changes to ensure deals are not anti-competitive. Changes the government may require could take away from the $6 billion in run-rate synergies, Macquarie analysts said.  SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son \u201crejected a deal with T-Mobile four months ago that was better for him than the deal he is taking now,\u201d said Jonathan Chaplin at New Street Research. \u201cThe market is assuming that things must be pretty bleak at Sprint for Masa to return to the negotiating table after a mere four months to take a lower offer.\u201d  Sprint and T-Mobile had called off their last merger talks in November, partly because SoftBank did not want to cede control of Sprint.  This time, the companies touted tax reforms from the Trump administration, synergies at present value of $43 billion, and plans to invest billions on developing a 5G network. They are also promising job growth and lower costs for wireless customers.  NO BREAKUP FEE  Sprint asked T-Mobile to be paid a breakup fee should regulators block their deal, people familiar with the confidential negotiations said, a standard form of insurance for acquisition targets when it comes to mergers with high antitrust risk.  However, T-Mobile managed to avoid it, arguing the deal was already generous enough for Sprint and that the companies should demonstrate confidence in the deal\u2019s regulatory prospects by having no such breakup fee, the sources said. With no appetite to terminate deal negotiations for the third time in four years, Sprint accepted, the sources said.  \u201cThe lack of a break-up fee suggests that both companies are willing to \u2018give it a try\u2019 from a regulatory point of view given the very significant synergies opportunities,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Simon Flannery said.  Under their contract, T-Mobile is still liable to pay Sprint a $600 million fee if it walks away from the deal despite it having been cleared by regulators and met other requirements to close, a regulatory filing on Monday showed.  Company officials told the FCC they expect to file a formal application with the commission by the end of May.  In September, the FCC approved a report that found, for the first time since 2009, there is \u201ceffective competition\u201d in the wireless market, a finding that could help Sprint and T-Mobile make the case for the merger.  A decade ago, there were seven major U.S. wireless carriers and today the largest four carriers - led by Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc - control 98.8 percent of the U.S. market, the FCC said.  In case the deal falls through, Sprint, with long-term debt of more than $32 billion, will be under much more stress than T-Mobile, analysts said.  However, brokerage Oppenheimer expects 80 percent approval probability, but with conditions.  Another analyst with CFRA Research estimated a 50 percent chance of regulatory approval.","271":"July 25 (Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc on Thursday beat analysts\u2019 estimates for second-quarter net new phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill, boosted by the U.S. mobile carrier\u2019s competitive wireless plans aimed at fending off its bigger rivals.

A sign for a T-Mobile store is seen in Manhattan, New York, U.S., April 30, 2018. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  Lenders have extended about US$679bn in loans backing global M&A deals so far this year, toppling the prior record of almost US$542bn set for the same period in 2007 before the financial crisis, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data.  These numbers promise to keep swelling, with Vodafone nearing a transformational deal to buy assets from cable giant Liberty Global.  \u201cA generally business-friendly environment in Washington, DC, a positive economic outlook and favorable tax treatment, both in terms of corporate rates and being able to access foreign reserves in a tax efficient way, appears to be giving boards the confidence they need to pull the trigger on strategic transactions, some of which have been in the works for a while,\u201d said Jason Kyrwood, a partner at Davis Polk.  Industry-specific factors, including the so-called Amazon effect and the need for international expansion to drive growth, are also at play, he said.  \u201cCertainly there\u2019s no shortage of financing available,\u201d Kyrwood said. \u201cThere are more marquee deals than we\u2019ve seen in a while, and banks are eager to participate.\u201d  Corporations clamoring for growth and diversity are striking while the iron is hot, with borrowing costs still low and investor demand for the debt backing many of these transactions still high.  The US$1.7trn of global mergers and acquisitions announced this year, a record for this period, tops just over US$1trn during the same time a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence.  SIX-STRONG  Six banks initially committed US$38bn of loans to back the tie-up between the third- and fourth-largest US wireless carriers.  The financing comprises a US$4bn five-year revolving credit, a US$7bn seven-year senior secured term loan B, a US$19bn 364-day senior secured bridge loan and US$8bn in senior unsecured bridge loans that will be replaced by high-yield bonds.  Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and RBC are providing the debt.  \u201cThe challenge with T-Mobile and Sprint is a very long regulatory period \u2013 12 to 24 months of intense scrutiny,\u201d said a senior banker.  Banks are being judicious, he said, moderating exposure to the huge deals to leave room for oncoming deals and to manage potentially long regulatory reviews that could tie up balance sheets.  \u201cIt\u2019s not so much that banks are at capacity, but wanting to keep capacity open, because everybody sees a very strong and building pipeline for M&A and they hate to be stopped out of the next deals because they just locked up their balance sheet,\u201d the senior banker said.  MORE SHOPPING  Online retailer Amazon\u2019s unconventional mash-up with grocery chain Whole Foods Market last summer has raised the stakes for atypical mergers, especially in industries where behemoth Amazon is perceived to be a potential competitor.  \u201cCompanies are trying to come up with the next killer combination or economic coupling that will generate more profit than traditional business models,\u201d another senior banker said.  As the push for diversification and profit heats up, technology and healthcare are among the leaders in consolidation.  CVS Health Corp on Wednesday said it still expects its US$69bn deal to buy health insurer Aetna Inc, announced last December, to close during this year\u2019s second half. That merger was followed in March by Cigna Corp\u2019s plan to buy pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts for US$52bn.

Sprint shares were up 8.7 percent at $6.11 and T-Mobile rose 6.7 percent to $65.65 in late-afternoon trading, after the New York Post reported that U.S. regulators believed that just three national providers were needed, removing an obstacle to the deal.

The source, requesting anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record, said \u201cat least\u201d three carriers were needed, and that the report\u2019s assertion that regulators have decided on just three carriers was not entirely accurate.  The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. T-Mobile and Sprint declined to comment.  The deal, announced in late April, faces a review from the Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission that will likely last more than a year.

The Obama administration had taken at least twice to ensure that the United States had four wireless carriers. The head of the U.S. Justice Department Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim, has declined to endorse that and said in June: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any magical number that I\u2019m smart enough to glean.\u201d","281":"The Sprint logo is displayed on a a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., April 30, 2018.

The agreement caps four years of on- and off- talks between the companies, setting the stage for the creation of a carrier with 127 million customers that will be a more formidable competitor to the No.1 and No.2 wireless players, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc.  U.S. regulators, which have challenged in court AT&T\u2019s $85 billion deal to buy U.S. media company Time Warner Inc, are expected to grill Sprint and T-Mobile on how they will price their combined wireless offerings.  The breakthrough in the companies\u2019 negotiations, first reported by Reuters on Thursday, came after T-Mobile majority-owner Deutsche Telekom AG and Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp, which controls Sprint, agreed on a structure that will allow Deutsche Telekom to continue to consolidate the combined company, which will have a market value of over $80 billions, on its books.  Deutsche Telekom will own 42 percent of the combined company.  Sprint\u2019s and T-Mobile\u2019s first round of merger talks ended unsuccessfully in 2014 after U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s administration expressed antitrust concerns about the deal.  Under U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, regulators have continued to fret about consumer prices. The U.S. government has opened a probe into alleged coordination by AT&T, Verizon Communications and a telecommunications standards organization to hinder consumers from easily switching wireless carriers, a person briefed on the matter said earlier this month.  The second round of talks between Sprint and T-Mobile ended in November over valuation disagreements, although Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Hoettges, left the door open at the time, saying: \u201cYou always meet twice in life.\u201d  Since then, Sprint\u2019s shares lost about a fifth of their value amid questions about how the company can compete effectively under the weight of its long-term debt of more than $32 billion.  Softbank has been looking to trim its own debt as well, which reached 15.8 trillion yen ($147 billion) as of the end of December. It has said it is planning to raise cash by taking its Japanese mobile phone unit public this year.  Failure to clinch a deal last November left SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, a dealmaker who raised close to $100 billion for his Vision Fund to invest in technology companies, in search of other options for Sprint.  INVESTING IN 5G TECHNOLOGY  Even though Sprint\u2019s customer base has expanded under CEO Marcelo Claure, growth has been driven by discounting. Analysts say that, without T-Mobile, Sprint lacks the scale needed to invest in its network and to compete in a saturated market.  T-Mobile has fared better than Sprint, even if it remains a distant third to Verizon and AT&T. It has managed to score sustained market share gains, as innovative offerings, improving network performance and good customer service attract new customers, according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service Inc.  T-Mobile became the first major U.S. carrier to eliminate two-year contracts, a shift quickly embraced by consumers and copied by competitors. The company has also badgered rivals with its unlimited data plans.  Both Sprint and T-Mobile are far behind Verizon and AT&T in upgrading their network to accommodate next generation 5G wireless technology. Even after their merger, the combined company\u2019s budget to invest in 5G will be smaller than Verizon or AT&T\u2019s.  However, Sprint and T-Mobile hope the deal will give them more firepower to participate in auction for spectrum to develop 5G. They plan to participate in a spectrum auction in late fall.

It has said it is planning to raise cash by taking its Japanese mobile phone unit public this year.  Sprint and T-Mobile decided to restart talks partly because they want to share the burden of investing in their networks, the sources said. The negotiations are at an early stage, they added.  A key consideration in the talks is Deutsche Telekom\u2019s ability to consolidate T-Mobile\u2019s earnings, one of the sources said. Deutsche Telekom owns 63 percent of T-Mobile, which has emerged as one of its more prized assets. Deutsche Telekom would likely have to put in new money toward a merger for its stake to remain above 50 percent.  The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Sprint and Deutsche Telekom declined to comment, while T-Mobile did not respond to requests for comment.  \u201cI don\u2019t see how Deutsche Telekom agrees to a transaction in which it relinquishes control,\u201d said Dhananjay Mirchandani, a telecoms analyst at Bernstein.  Mirchandani said any control premium would probably be palatable to Deutsche Telekom\u2019s shareholders. He doubted, however, that the case for a deal had become more compelling since November.  Shares of Sprint closed up more than 17 percent at $6.02, giving the company a market capitalization of $25 billion, after the Wall Street Journal first reported on the new talks.  T-Mobile rose 5.67 percent to $63.13, valuing it at $54 billion.  In Tokyo, Softbank gained 3.5 percent to 7,980 yen, while Deutsche Telekom rallied by 4 percent in early European trading to 14.11 euros, a three-month high.  SEEKING OPTIONS  Failure to clinch a deal last November left SoftBank Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son, a dealmaker who raised close to $100 billion for his Vision Fund to invest in technology companies, in search of other options for Sprint.  \u201cSoftBank has to change the way they approach this,\u201d Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner said. \u201cUnless they have changed their minds, (and admitted) that they are indeed the junior partner, nothing has changed.\u201d  Even though Sprint\u2019s customer base has expanded under CEO Marcelo Claure, growth has been driven by discounting. Analysts say that, without T-Mobile, Sprint lacks the scale needed to invest in its network and to compete in a saturated market.  \u201cIt is impossible for Sprint to sustain on its own, and the same problems still exists with SoftBank and Sprint not comfortable with a minority stake,\u201d MoffettNathanson LLC analyst Craig Moffett said. \u201cBut ultimately you have to believe that these two companies will end up together even if the path to get there is torturous.\u201d  T-Mobile has fared better than Sprint, even if it remains a distant third to Verizon and AT&T.

The company has also badgered rivals with its unlimited data plans.  REGULATORY CONCERNS  Another roadblock to the deal could be regulatory hurdles. Sprint\u2019s and T-Mobile\u2019s first round of merger talks ended in 2014 after the Obama administration expressed antitrust concerns about the deal.  It was not immediately clear how the Trump administration would view the combination. AT&T agreed to acquire U.S. media company Time Warner Inc TWX.N in October 2016 for $85 billion. The U.S. Department of Justice has sued to block the deal over concerns about the companies' pricing power in the media market. AT&T and Time Warner are currently defending their deal in court.  Caroline Holland, a veteran of the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division who is now a Mozilla tech policy fellow, said that Sprint and T-Mobile would likely argue that their combination would mean more effective competition for Verizon and AT&T.  \u201cThey are probably betting that they can make a competent and convincing argument that it\u2019s more important to have a stronger No. 3. They\u2019ll make a case that Sprint hasn\u2019t been a strong competitor,\u201d she said.  \u201cI have a very healthy skepticism.

That was due to T-Mobile\u2019s lower prices compared to its competitors, as well as an expansion into more rural areas of the United States, the company said.  T-Mobile, the third-largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscriber count, is awaiting approval of its $26 billion deal to buy smaller rival Sprint Corp, which it has said will give it scale to compete with market leaders Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc.

Shares of T-Mobile rose 11% to $94.01 while Sprint soared more than 74% to $8.34.  Finalizing a deal will be a boon to Japan\u2019s Softbank Group Corp, Sprint\u2019s controlling shareholder, as the conglomerate offloads a troubled asset that has lost subscribers at a faster rate and as it seeks to secure funding for a second Vision Fund.  During the trial, Sprint executives argued that the deal was a matter of survival.  Uniting T-Mobile\u2019s low-band spectrum and Sprint\u2019s mid-band spectrum could allow a faster roll-out of a national 5G network, the companies have said.  Sprint and T-Mobile said in a statement that they would move to finalize the merger, which is still subject to closing conditions and possible additional court proceedings.  FIERCE OPPOSITION  The states, led by California and New York, had said the deal would reduce competition, leading to higher prices.  \u201cThe merger of T-Mobile and Sprint will create another telecommunications behemoth in an already dangerously consolidated market,\u201d U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote on Tuesday.  The decision by U.S. District Court Judge Victor Marrero clears the path for the deal, which already has federal approval and was originally valued at $26 billion.  Judge Marrero said he based his decision on three essential points. The first was that he was not persuaded by the states that the deal would lead to higher prices or lower-quality wireless services.  He disagreed that Sprint would remain a strong competitor and was unconvinced that DISH Network Corp, which is buying divested assets from the deal, would fail to live up to its promises to enter and compete in the wireless market.  \u201cThe court concludes that the proposed merger is not reasonably likely to substantially lessen competition,\u201d Judge Marrero wrote, adding that he was confident in DISH\u2019s ability to transform into a \u201cdisruptive maverick\u201d in the wireless industry.  The states maintained that Dish was ill-equipped to become a competitive fourth wireless carrier, noting that it lacks experience, scale and brand recognition in wireless.  New York\u2019s attorney general said the state is considering an appeal; California\u2019s attorney general said that state is \u201cprepared to fight.\u201d  Rani Habash, a partner at the law firm Dechert LLP who specializes in antitrust, said the states would have difficulty winning an appeal. The judge \u201cfound the Sprint and T-Mobile side to be more credible for their prediction of the future,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have a factual determination, that\u2019s very hard to overcome.\u201d  A smartphones with Sprint logo are seen in front of a screen projection of T-mobile logo, in this picture illustration taken April 30, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  A spokesman for the California Public Utilities Commission, the last regulatory body to decide on the merger, said its review of the deal is expected to conclude in July.  The judge\u2019s decision to let the deal proceed drew criticism from some antitrust experts.  \u201cIf this merger is not anticompetitive, even with the remedies agreed to, it is hard to know what is,\u201d said Eleanor Fox, trade regulation and antitrust law professor at New York University.  The U.S. Justice Department approved the deal in July after the carriers agreed to sell some prepaid assets to satellite provider Dish, which would create its own cellular network to ensure there would still be four competitors in the market. The Federal Communications Commission signed off on the deal in October in a vote split 3-2 along party lines.  FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the ruling was a big win for American consumers and would help ensure U.S. leadership in rolling out a 5G network.","299":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Deutsche Telekom AG is silhouetted against the sun and clouds atop of the headquarters of German telecommunications giant in Bonn, Germany, February 19, 2019. REUTERS\/Wolfgang Rattay  BARCELONA (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom DTEGn.DE slipped out of its comfort zone on leverage in the third quarter due to paper losses on hedges taken out to pay for U.S. unit T-Mobile's TMUS.O acquisition of Sprint S.N, CEO Tim Hoettges said on Wednesday.  The $26 billion deal was struck a year and a half ago but has yet to close, leaving the German-led group exposed to adverse moves in financial markets on insurance that it took out to cover a third of the cost.  \u201cThe net debt was higher than we thought - over 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) higher,\u201d Hoettges told the Morgan Stanley European TMT Conference in Barcelona, attributing the losses to a strong dollar and declining U.S. interest rates.  Deutsche Telekom\u2019s net debt rose to 78.8 billion euros in the quarter, lifting its leverage ratio to 2.8 times core earnings. That is above a target range of 2.25-2.75 times that underpins its investment-grade credit ratings.  The Bonn-based group cut its planned dividend for 2019 to 60 cents to address the financial burden from the U.S. deal as well as higher-than-expected costs to buy spectrum for and build 5G mobile networks.  Hoettges said the slippage would be temporary: \u201cBy the end of the year we will be comfortably back in the range that we have indicated to rating agencies,\u201d he said.","300":"NEW YORK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - U.S. wireless carriers T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp are expected to urge a federal judge on Wednesday to let them proceed with their $26.5 billion merger, as a group of states argues the deal violates federal antitrust laws.  The states filed a lawsuit in June in a bid to block the merger, saying it would lead to higher prices for consumers. T-Mobile and Sprint contend that the merger would enable the combined company to compete more effectively with dominant carriers Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc.  U.S. District Court Judge Victor Marrero, who presided over a two-week trial last month in Manhattan federal court, is scheduled to hear closing arguments in the case on Wednesday.  The U.S. Justice Department approved the deal in July after the carriers agreed to sell some assets to satellite provider Dish Network Corp, which would create its own cellular network to ensure that there would still be four competitors in the market. The Federal Communications Commission signed off on the deal in October.  Executives from the companies, including outspoken T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere, testified during the trial that Sprint\u2019s business was deteriorating and would not survive if it did not merge with T-Mobile.  The carriers argued that selling Sprint\u2019s prepaid business and some wireless spectrum to Dish Network Corp would help the satellite TV provider become a mobile carrier and preserve a fourth wireless company in the industry.  The states, led by New York and California, maintained that Dish was ill-equipped to become a competitive fourth wireless carrier because it had not yet built a network using the wireless spectrum, or airwaves that carry data, it already owned.  The states also painted Dish as a hoarder of spectrum, a finite resource regulated by the government.  Last week, a federal judge who will assess the Justice Department\u2019s approval of the merger, said he would allow friend of court comment filings regarding the case.

The third-largest U.S. mobile carrier said it added a net 710,000 phone subscribers in the three months ended June 30, compared with 686,000 additions a year earlier.  Analysts were expecting 643,000 new subscribers, according to research firm FactSet.  Postpaid figures are closely watched as customers who opt for the plan pay a recurring monthly bill and are more valuable to carriers that prepaid users.  T-Mobile US is awaiting approval for its $26.5 billion deal to buy smaller rival Sprint Corp S.N as it strives for more scale to compete with bigger rivals such as Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N and AT&T Inc T.N.  The company\u2019s net income rose to $939 million, or $1.09 per share, in the quarter, from $782 million, or 92 cents a share, a year earlier.  Analysts had expected the company to earn 97 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The company disclosed the expenses in a letter after Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Pramila Jayapal, both Democrats, sent letters to leaders of the Trump Organization and T-Mobile last month after reports that T-Mobile executives started regularly using the Trump hotel. Photos of Legere, who regularly stays at the hotel, began appearing on social media sites, with him wearing his customary pink T-Mobile-themed attire.  After questions were raised about the Trump hotel stays, Legere posted a photo of himself from another prominent Washington hotel.  The company said in a Feb. 21 letter the $195,000 included costs for \u201cmeeting space, catering, business center services, audio\/visual equipment rental, lodging, meals, taxes and other incidental expenses.\u201d  The Democrats said the hotel stays \u201craise questions about whether T-Mobile is attempting to curry favor with the President, who has not fully divested from his financial interests, via their numerous and expensive stays in the Trump Hotel.\u201d  The Washington Post reported that T-Mobile executives had reserved at least 52 nights at the hotel since the merger announcement, dramatically boosting the company\u2019s use of the hotel.  The company said the Trump hotel expenses were just 14 percent of its total spent at Washington area hotels during that period.  \u201cWhile we understand that staying at Trump properties might be viewed positively by some and negatively by others, we are confident that the relevant agencies address the questions before them on the merits,\u201d said Anthony Russo, T-Mobile USA\u2019s vice president for federal legislative affairs.  The Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission are still reviewing the proposed deal to combined the third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers.  Trump and Legere feuded publicly in 2015. Legere complained about a street drummer outside a Trump hotel, which prompted Trump to call T Mobile\u2019s service \u201cterrible\u201d in a tweet.  Legere said in his letter to the Democrats that he has stayed at Trump properties in Chicago, New York and Washington and said the Washington hotel \u201cis located close by my company office ... and the Department of Justice.\u201d  Last month, nine senators, including Warren, urged regulators to reject the merger.","304":"A Deutsche Telekom logo is seen at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 26, 2018. REUTERS\/Yves Herman  FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom DTEGn.DE said its leverage would increase beyond its target corridor as a result of the takeover by its unit T-Mobile US TMUS.O of Sprint Corp S.N, but will return to the comfort zone in 2021.  Deutsche Telekom\u2019s adjusted net debt, as a multiple of its earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) will exceed its target corridor of 2-2.5 times following the deal, it said in a statement.  \u201cStrong free cash flow generation of T-Mobile US over the coming years is expected to result in strong deleveraging, bringing the ratio back to the target corridor in 2021,\u201d Deutsche Telekom said.  T-Mobile US agreed on Sunday to acquire Sprint in an all-stock deal for $26 billion that will combine the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers and is expected to attract regulatory scrutiny over its impact on consumers.  Deutsche Telekom will effectively control the merged entity, and expects to consolidate its results, sources have said.","305":"(Reuters) - U.S. wireless carriers T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp have made progress in negotiating merger terms and are aiming to successfully complete deal talks as early as next week, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.  FILE PHOTO: Smartphones with the logos of T-Mobile and Sprint are seen in this illustration taken September 19, 2017. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The combined company would have more than 127 million customers and could create more formidable competition for the No.1 and No.2 wireless players, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc, amid a race to expand offerings in 5G, the next generation of wireless technology.  T-Mobile majority-owner Deutsche Telekom and Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp, which controls Sprint, are considering an agreement that would dictate how they exercise voting control over the combined company, two of the sources said.  This could allow Deutsche Telekom to consolidate the combined company on its books, even without owning a majority stake, the sources added. Deutsche Telekom owns more than 63 percent of T-Mobile, while SoftBank owns 84.7 percent of Sprint.  Deutsche Telekom and T-Mobile are also in the process of finalising the debt financing package they will use to fund the deal, the sources said.  There is no certainty that a deal will be reached, the sources cautioned. The companies came close to a merger agreement in November before SoftBank\u2019s chief executive officer, Masayoshi Son, pulled out of the talks at the last minute.  The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Sprint, T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom and SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Sprint and T-Mobile have market capitalizations of $24 billion and $55 billion, respectively. Sprint shares rose 9 percent in after hours trading in New York, while T-Mobile shares were up 4 percent.  When the previous round of talks between the companies ended in November over valuation disagreements, Deutsche Telekom Chief Executive Officer Tim Hoettges left the door open by saying: \u201cYou always meet twice in life.\u201d  Failure to clinch a deal had left SoftBank\u2019s Son, a dealmaker who raised close to $100 billion for his Vision Fund to invest in technology companies, in search of other options for Sprint.  SoftBank has been looking to trim its debt, which reached 15.8 trillion yen ($147 billion) as of the end of December. It has said it is planning to raise cash by taking its Japanese mobile phone unit public this year.  Even though Sprint\u2019s customer base has expanded under CEO Marcelo Claure, growth has been driven by discounting. Analysts have said that without T-Mobile, Sprint lacks the scale needed to invest in its network and to compete in a saturated market.  T-Mobile, under its Chief Executive Officer John Legere, has fared better than Sprint, even if it remains a distant third to Verizon and AT&T. It has managed to score sustained market share gains, as innovative offerings, improving network performance and good customer service attract new customers, according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service Inc.  T-Mobile became the first major U.S. carrier to eliminate two-year contracts, a shift quickly embraced by consumers and copied by competitors. The company has also unsettled rivals with its unlimited data plans.  Another roadblock to the deal could be regulatory hurdles. Sprint\u2019s and T-Mobile\u2019s first round of merger talks ended in 2014 after U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s administration expressed antitrust concerns about the deal.  It is not clear how the Trump administration would view the combination. AT&T agreed to acquire U.S. media company Time Warner Inc in October 2016 for $85 billion. The U.S. Department of Justice has sued to block the deal over concerns about the companies\u2019 pricing power in the media market. AT&T and Time Warner are currently defending their deal in court.","306":"(Paragraph 4 corrects to ... and two other T-Mobile bonds and a Sprint bond valued at less than $1,001 ... instead of T-Mobile notes and a Sprint note.)  WASHINGTON, April 30 (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General William Barr has recused himself from the Justice Department\u2019s deliberations on whether to allow T-Mobile to proceed with its $26 billion acquisition of Sprint, according to a source familiar with the decision.  The department\u2019s Antitrust Division, headed by Makan Delrahim, is reviewing the deal to determine if it will lead to higher prices for consumers or to slower innovation, as critics allege. The Federal Communications Commission also must approve the transaction for it to go forward.  The recusal was first reported by the New York Post.  In a filing with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics in December, Barr acknowledged owning a T-Mobile bond valued at $15,001 to $50,000 and two other T-Mobile bonds and a Sprint bond valued at less than $1,001. Those are to be sold within 90 days of his confirmation, which occurred on Feb. 14.  Barr had also recused himself from considering AT&T\u2019s plan to buy Time Warner, which the government opposed, because of his involvement with those companies. That deal has closed.  T-Mobile announced on Monday that the companies were extending a deadline to complete their deal to July 29. The two are among just four national wireless carriers, trailing Verizon Communications and AT&T.  Regulators are expected to make a decision on the deal in early June. They will be weighing a potential loss of competition, and subsequently higher prices for consumers, against the prospect of a more powerful No. 3 wireless carrier which can work to build a faster, better 5G next generation wireless network.
