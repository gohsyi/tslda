Feb 20 (Reuters) - Anglo-German chip designer Dialog Semiconductor is buying California-based Adesto Technologies for $500 million to diversify further away from its reliance Apple, it said on Thursday.  Dialog, which specialises in power-management chips and low-energy Bluetooth products used in fitness trackers and cordless earphones, will pay $12.55 per share in a cash deal representing a 57% premium to Adesto\u2019s closing price on Wednesday.  For Chief Executive Jalal Bagherli, the deal marks another step towards de-risking Dialog after it struck a $600 million deal with Apple in 2018 to hand over people and patents behind the main integrated power-management circuits in the iPhone.  \u201cThe strategic value (of the Adesto deal) is more in the industrial internet of things - smart buildings, smart cities,\u201d Bagherli told Reuters on Thursday.","1":"SHANGHAI\/TAIPEI (Reuters) - Apple AAPL.O said on Monday it has put its Taiwanese supplier Pegatron 4938.TW on probation after finding that the company violated Apple's supplier code of conduct by asking student employees to work night shifts or overtime.  Pegatron had mis-classified student workers and falsified paperwork to disguise the violations, and in some cases also breached the code by allowing students to perform work unrelated to their majors, the U.S. technology giant said.  Pegatron is one of a handful of Taiwanese manufacturers on the island, alongside Foxconn 2317.TW2354.TW, who dominate Apple's iPhone assembly chain.  \u201cSeveral weeks ago, we discovered Pegatron - one of Apple\u2019s suppliers in China - violated Apple\u2019s Supplier Code of Conduct in its administration of a student work study programme,\u201d it said in a statement.  \u201cApple has placed Pegatron on probation and Pegatron will not receive any new business from Apple until they complete all of the corrective actions required.\u201d Apple did not declare the terms of the probation.  Apple\u2019s investigations had found no evidence of forced or underage labour, it said, adding that Pegatron had now fired the executive with direct oversight of the programme.  \u201cThe individuals at Pegatron responsible for the violations went to extraordinary lengths to evade our oversight mechanisms,\u201d Apple said.  Pegatron\u2019s shares closed down 2.1% on Monday, underperforming a 1.2% rise in the broader Taipei market.  Pegatron said in a separate statement that student workers at its Shanghai and Kunshan campuses had been found working without complying with local rules and regulations.  They had now been taken off the production lines and given \u201cproper compensation\u201d, it said.  It did not address in its statement how being put on probation by Apple might impact the company. Pegatron reported a T$19.3 billion ($676 million) profit in 2019, up 74% on the previous year.  Apple last month launched its next-generation iPhone 12, with faster 5G connectivity.  Apple and its suppliers have been accused of poor labour practices in the past, but the U.S. company has been trying to get a grip over such issues by releasing annual reviews of the iPhone supply chain.  In 2017, Apple and Foxconn said a small number of students were discovered working overtime in one of the latter\u2019s Chinese factories, violating local labour laws.  In July the third major Taiwanese assembler of the handset, Wistron, sold two smaller factories in China to Dongguan-based Luxshare 002475.SZ, a fast-growing firm emblematic of China's rising home-grown suppliers which are gradually increasing rivalry with the Taiwanese giants.","2":"FILE PHOTO - A portrait of Apple co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs is placed on the Federation Tower skyscraper in Moscow's new business district, October 19 2011. REUTERS\/Denis Sinyakov  LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A one-page job application filled out by Steve Jobs more than four decades ago that reflected the Apple founder\u2019s technology aspirations sold for $174,000 at a U.S. auction, more than three times its presale estimate.  An Internet entrepreneur from England was the winning bidder, Boston-based auction house RR Auction said on Friday, but the buyer wished to remain anonymous.  The application dated 1973, complete with spelling and punctuation errors, had been expected to fetch about $50,000. The sale price reached on Thursday was $174,757, the auction house said.  The form lists his name as \u201cSteven jobs\u201d and address as \u201creed college,\u201d the Portland, Oregon, college he attended briefly. Next to \u201cPhone:\u201d he wrote \u201cnone.\u201d  Under a section titled \u201cSpecial Abilities,\u201d Jobs wrote \u201ctech or design engineer. digital.\u2014from Bay near Hewitt-Packard,\u201d a reference to pioneering California technology company Hewlett-Packard and the San Francisco Bay area.  The document does not state what position or company the application was intended for. Jobs and friend Steve Wozniak founded Apple about three years later.  RR Auction said the high price reflected the continuing influence of Jobs, who died of cancer in 2011 at the age of 56.  \u201cThere are many collectors who have earned disposable income over the last few decades using Apple technology, and we expect similarly strong results on related material in the future,\u201d Bobby Livingston, executive vice president at RR Auction, said in a statement.  Other highlights from the online auction included an Apple Mac OS X technical manual signed by Jobs in 2001 that sold for $41,806 and a rare signed newspaper clipping from 2008 featuring an image of Jobs speaking at the Apple Developers Conference that sold for $26,950.","3":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window.)  * Apple gains on electric car production plan  * Peloton jumps on $420 mln deal to buy peer Precor  * Amgen down as asthma drug late-stage trial fails  * Indexes: Dow down 0.40%, S&P falls 0.19%, Nasdaq up 0.13% (Adds comment; updates share prices)  Dec 22 (Reuters) - The Dow and the S&P 500 slipped on Tuesday as concerns over a new variant of the coronavirus and weak economic readings prompted investors to lock in recent gains, while the Nasdaq was kept in positive territory by Apple.  U.S. home sales fell more than expected in November, while consumer confidence unexpectedly declined this month following a spike in U.S. infections and deaths.  The data added to concerns of further economic disruption from a new coronavirus variant raging in Britain that has pushed the country into effective COVID-19 quarantine.  \u201cYou could point to consumer confidence, existing home sales being a little weaker today, but I think it\u2019s broader than that. The market\u2019s a bit overpriced, it\u2019s looking for a reason to back off,\u201d said Kenny Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors.  Losses on the technology-heavy Nasdaq were limited by Apple Inc. The index also briefly hit a record high.  Apple rose 2.5% after Reuters exclusively reported that the company was planning a push into vehicle and battery production.  \u201cIf the second strain of the coronavirus starts to impact countries again, then that whole work from home trend is going to pick up steam and that\u2019s what\u2019s going on in technology today,\u201d Polcari added.  The S&P 500 technology subsector was the sole gainer among its peers, touching a record high. The sector has vastly outperformed this year thanks to tech\u2019s perceived resilience to virus-related disruptions.  At 12:06 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 121.70 points, or 0.40%, at 30,094.75, the S&P 500 was down 6.97 points, or 0.19%, at 3,687.95, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 16.49 points, or 0.13%, at 12,759.01.  All three major indexes had hit record highs last week in anticipation of a coronavirus stimulus bill. But they were off to a rough start this week after the discovery of the new virus variant, as well as some disappointment over the size of the aid bill approved by Congress.  Still, the indexes were set for strong annual gains, as an initial slump due to the coronavirus was followed by one of the fastest ever recoveries from a bear market by the S&P 500.  Electric-car maker Tesla Inc fell 3.4%, adding to a more than 6% slump in its first day of trading as part of the S&P 500 on Monday.  Amgen Inc fell 2.3% and was among the top drags on the Dow, after it said its experimental asthma drug failed to meet the main goal of a late-stage study.  Peloton Interactive Inc jumped nearly 20% after the exercise bike maker said it would buy peer Precor in a $420 million deal.

Apple shares are virtually flat year-to-date, compared with a 12% drop in the S&P 500 Index .SPX.  The technology company raised $8.5 billion by selling four different bonds with maturities ranging from three years to 30 years. It sold a $2 billion three-year bond and a five-year $2.25 billion with coupons of 0.75% and 1.125% respectively, the lowest rates the company has paid on bonds with such durations since 2013, according to Refinitiv IFR data.  The coupons on Apple\u2019s 10-year and 30-year bonds were also the lowest the company has paid in the past years, according to the Refinitiv data.  The funds will go toward general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and dividend payments, Apple said in a regulatory filing. During the six months ended March 28, Apple spent $38.5 billion to repurchase its own stock.  The Fed slashed interest rates to almost zero in March and said it would act as buyer of last resort in the investment-grade corporate bond market, in a bid to help cash-strapped companies access capital markets roiled by the economic fallout from the pandemic.  While the Federal Reserve has yet to buy a single corporate bond, the intervention has fueled record issuance by companies in need of funding, such as Boeing Co BA.N, Marriott International Inc MAR.O and Ford Motor Co F.N.  The policy has also allowed financially strong companies such as Apple, which had just over $40 billion in cash as of the end of March, to reduce its cost of capital to the benefit of shareholders.  In the past week, drugmaker Biogen Inc BIIB.O and U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc ANTM.N have also sold new bonds at low rates, which the companies said were partly to fund share buybacks.  Goldman Sachs & Co, BofA Securities, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley were joint book-running managers on the Apple bond offering.","6":"CAMPBELL, California, Oct 31 (Reuters) - For over 14 years at Apple Inc, Rub\u00e9n Caballero had to include a cable with every iPhone design whose wireless engineering he oversaw, from the first prototypes in 2005 to iPhone 11 models on shelves now.  Now, as chief wireless strategist for Silicon Valley startup Keyssa Inc, Caballero hopes to cut the cord for good - for all smartphones. His new position has not been previously reported.  Every iPhone since the first released in 2007 has come with a cable as a failsafe way to transfer data, as has virtually every other brand of phone.  Keyssa wants to end that with its chip that can transfer data nearly as fast as a wire by placing two devices next to each other. Early customer LG Electronics Inc uses the chip to connect the second screen of its LG V50 smart phone.  Wireless charging has taken hold in phones, but wireless data connections like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi remain too finicky to discard cables altogether.  Keyssa has raised more than $100 million from the venture groups at Intel Corp, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , Foxconn parent Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd and a fund run by Tony Fadell, another former Apple executive who helped create the iPod and then hired Caballero for the original iPhone team.  \u201cEvery single consumer product would love to solve the external connector,\u201d Caballero, who left Apple earlier this year, said in an interview at Keyssa\u2019s headquarters in Campbell, California.  Caballero, a retired Canadian Air Force captain who favors all-black attire, also has his eyes on the inside of phones. There, cables cause engineering headaches.  Camera modules connect to main circuit boards with a thin cables. Bend them enough and they break, creating an unintentional \u201cbeautiful antenna\u201d that interferes with cellular data connections, Caballero said.  With Keyssa\u2019s chips, camera modules could touch the circuit board to transmit data wirelessly. The chips use high frequencies that cause no interference inside the phone or with nearby devices.  \u201cWhat\u2019s beautiful about this is the frequency,\u201d Caballero said. \u201cIt just fixes a lot of problems.\u201d  Aside from phones, Keyssa is testing chips with video display makers and at least one maker of lidar sensors, the electronic eyes of self-driving cars.  \u201cRuben is a powerhouse when it comes to commercializing great technology,\u201d Fadell told Reuters.  Caballero brings with him experience overseeing more than 1,000 Apple wireless engineers in a department with a budget of $600 million for testing equipment alone.  Before joining Apple, Caballero worked at two startups and relished the frenzied pace there and during his early days at Apple working with Fadell.  When Fadell brought him to Apple in 2005, Caballero asked where all the test equipment and labs were for the group.  \u201cHe said, \u2018We don\u2019t have anything, but we\u2019ll get it done,\u2019\u201d Caballero said. \u201cYou know when has something in his eyes \u2013 you can see the vision.

Expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will signal more policy tightening ahead kept investors wary of big market moves, especially after currency markets were roiled this week by the dollar\u2019s surge to 3 1\/2-month highs against a basket of currencies.  But the dollar edged back down after Tuesday\u2019s 0.7 percent rise, allowing world stocks to rise after two days of losses , especially following Apple\u2019s 4 percent after-market gains.  The world\u2019s biggest company by market capitalisation beat profit and revenue expectations in the first quarter, thanks to robust iPhone sales, and it announced a $100 billion share buyback.  Germany-listed Apple shares jumped 5.7 percent and the New York-listed stock was 3.6 percent higher in pre-market trade.  \u201cThe headline news from Apple on iPhone sales has been taken well and there\u2019s a relief bounce today across Apple supply chain names which had been hit in recent weeks,\u201d said Neil Campling, co-head of the global thematic group at Mirabaud Securities.  The results lifted Europe\u2019s tech index 1.2 percent to a six-week high, led by an 8 percent surge in shares in AMS , provider of the facial recognition technology used in iPhones.  Chipmakers STMicroelectronics, Infineon, BE Semiconductor and ASML also gained 1.1 to 3.8 percent, enjoying the positive mood on the sector.  U.S. equity futures signalled the S&P500 would open 0.2 percent higher. Futures for the Nasdaq tech benchmark were half a percent higher.  Tech gains were less marked in Asia, where markets in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong all closed weaker. Campling said the Apple results had raised some \u201cred flags\u201d, including high inventory levels and a lower average selling price for its handsets.  \u201cIt\u2019s a strange thing to do, to increase inventory so sharply. There will be more questions about \u2018where do we go from here\u2019,\u201d he said.  That uncertainty about future profits, alongside the possibility of higher U.S. interest rates, is weighing on other sectors too, even though S&P500 companies posted 10 percent earnings growth in the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters.  Oil and metals prices near multi-year highs are a major concern, leaving market players wondering if \u201cperhaps this is as good as it\u2019s going to get,\u201d said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore.  FED  U.S. 10-year yields hovered just below recent four-year highs above 3 percent. German yields, dragged to six-week highs by the U.S. bond selloff, stood just below those levels.  The Fed is likely to announce at 1800 GMT that it is holding interest rates steady. But it will probably encourage expectations of a rate increase in June.  Those expectations were strengthened after a survey on Tuesday suggested inflationary pressures were building .  A hawkish-sounding Fed could further boost the dollar, which has roared higher in recent weeks erasing its year-to-date losses versus a basket of currencies. The gains came amid signs the Fed will be the only major central bank to raise rates in the coming months.  \u201cIt is this concern around inflation and the robustness of the U.S. economy that is likely to dominate when the Fed concludes its meeting,\u201d said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in London.  \u201cIt will offer policymakers a decent opportunity to critique the health of the U.S. economy.\u201d  In contrast to the United States, rate rise expectations elsewhere have receded after disappointing economic data.  Expectations of a Bank of England rate rise this month have virtually been priced out. The European Central Bank and central banks in Japan, Switzerland and Sweden have all hinted that policy tightening remains some way off.  Fresh data confirmed that expectation for the euro zone, showing first-quarter growth at 0.4 percent, below the 0.7 percent quarterly increases seen in the past three quarters . HSBC analysts said the data showed the euro zone was experiencing \u201ca slowdown not a slump\u201d but they added that with inflation staying weak, \u201cthere is every reason for the ECB to maintain a dovish stance for the time being\u201d.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple\u2019s new innovation is to tap fear as well as greed. The $1 trillion firm\u2019s new watches can detect falls and heart conditions, making them a useful gift for grandma, as well as hypochondriacs everywhere. Meanwhile, aesthetic appeal and better cameras should be enough to convince many users to pay up for an improved phone.  Tech firms have been eyeing the vast and growing medical market for a while, with mostly mediocre results. Hefty regulation and the resulting long product-development cycles are an uncomfortable fit for impatient Silicon Valley firms. Gee-whiz-sounding products, such as Alphabet unit Google\u2019s smart contact lenses for measuring glucose levels in diabetics, often end up shelved due to the difficulties of producing something that\u2019s both effective and useful.  Apple\u2019s watches break this pattern. The ability to detect accidents or heart-rhythm abnormalities and notify the wearer\u2019s family members, emergency responders and doctors is a promising way to tap an aging population and those worried about them. The big question mark is how well it works \u2013 but the fact Apple has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for its electrocardiogram feature augurs well.  Watches haven\u2019t been a dominant product for the firm. Apple lumps sales with those of AirPods, Apple TV and Beats products when it reports, and together they account for 7 percent of total revenue. Yet these businesses have collectively been growing far faster than the company as a whole, at nearly 40 percent annually. Adding medical features probably will make the device into a breakout hit.  Meanwhile, Apple\u2019s new iPhones show its continuing ability to tap vanity and greed. The devices have plenty of useful improvements such as faster processors, dual-SIM support so users can use two operators, and better durability. But what will probably convince people to update their devices \u2013 at higher prices \u2013 is that they are visually appealing, take better pictures, and afford the chance for conspicuous consumption. For Apple, vanity is a virtue.","11":"SHANGHAI\/SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Apple Inc , facing a court ban in China on some of its iPhone models over alleged infringement of Qualcomm Inc patents, said on Friday it will push software updates to users in a bid to resolve potential issues.  Apple will carry out the software updates at the start of next week \u201cto address any possible concern about our compliance with the order\u201d, the firm said in a statement sent to Reuters.  Earlier this week, Qualcomm said a Chinese court had ordered a ban on sales of some older Apple iPhone models for violating two of its patents, though intellectual property lawyers said the ban would still likely take time to enforce.  \u201cBased on the iPhone models we offer today in China, we believe we are in compliance,\u201d Apple said.  \u201cEarly next week we will deliver a software update for iPhone users in China addressing the minor functionality of the two patents at issue in the case.\u201d  The case, brought by Qualcomm, is part of a global patent dispute between the two U.S. companies that includes dozens of lawsuits. It creates uncertainty over Apple\u2019s business in one of its biggest markets at a time when concerns over waning demand for new iPhones are battering its shares.  Qualcomm has said that the Fuzhou Intermediate People\u2019s Court in China found Apple infringed two patents held by the chipmaker and ordered an immediate ban on sales of older iPhone models, from the 6S through the X.  Apple has said that all of its phone models remained on sale in mainland China and that it had filed a request for reconsideration with the court. All the models appeared to be available to buy on Apple\u2019s China website on Friday.  Qualcomm, the biggest supplier of chips for mobile phones, filed its case in China in late 2017, arguing that Apple infringed patents on features related to resizing photographs and managing apps on a touch screen.

The price of the 64 GB iPhone XR has been reduced by at least 17,900 rupees ($259) due to a credit card cashback campaign and a price cut, two people with direct knowledge of with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.  \u201cApple is going to change their game,\u201d one of the people said. \u201cThey will start getting into the price game for other devices also depending on how their numbers shoot up.\u201d  On Apple\u2019s India website, the price of the 64 GB iPhone XR was unchanged at 76,900 rupees, but is on sale for less than 59,000 rupees at stores, the people said.  Prices for the two other XR variants have also dropped, they said. The XR is the cheapest series among iPhones Apple launched last year.  Apple did not respond to a request for comment.  The price reduction comes after iPhone prices were lowered in China for the second time this year, as Apple wrestles with a prolonged sales slowdown in the world\u2019s largest smartphone market partly due to a slowing economy.  In India, Apple\u2019s iPhones are up against the more competitive pricing of rival handsets from South Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and China\u2019s OnePlus.  \u201cThe focus of this entire (price cut) exercise is to win customers who would have thought of going to Samsung or OnePlus, to make them think whether they can spend some extra money on an iPhone XR - it\u2019s more bang for the buck,\u201d said Rushabh Doshi of tech research firm Canalys.  Samsung latest Galaxy S10e is priced at 55,900 rupees while the OnePlus 6T starts at 37,999 rupees.  Apple\u2019s share of India\u2019s $400-plus smartphone segment stood at 23 percent in 2018, behind both Samsung and OnePlus, showed data from Hong Kong-based tech researcher Counterpoint.

FILE PHOTO: Apple staff hold iPhone X packages at the Apple Store in Berlin, Germany, November 3, 2017. REUTERS\/Hannibal Hanschke\/File Photo  Qualcomm\u2019s win in Germany comes weeks after it secured a court order to ban sales of some iPhone models in China. Apple, which is contesting both rulings, has continued to offer its iPhones in China but made changes to its iOS operating system in the wake of the Chinese order.  The German victory may affect only a few million iPhones out of the hundreds of millions that Apple sells each year. Still, it is a small but clear win in a complex legal battle that will spin into overdrive in the coming months as antitrust regulators and Apple both take Qualcomm to court in the United States.  Apple alleges that Qualcomm engaged in illegal behavior to preserve a monopoly on modem chips, which help mobile devices connect to wireless data networks. Qualcomm has in turn accused Apple of using the chip supplier\u2019s vast stable of technology innovations without proper compensation.  While a sales ban in China could hurt Apple\u2019s bottom line, it is unlikely the two patent skirmishes will sway the outcome of the broader battle, where Qualcomm has suffered a series of setbacks fighting U.S. antitrust regulators.  Shares of Apple were down 2.3 percent at $157.12 in late trading, weighing on the broader market.  Qualcomm shares were down 0.2 percent at $56.69.  Qualcomm is not pursuing the software patents in the Chinese case in other jurisdictions and suffered an early loss while pursuing a U.S. sales ban on the U.S. version of the hardware patent at issue in Germany.  OLDER PHONES PULLED  On Thursday, Apple said it would pull older iPhones from its German stores after a court ruled that Apple had infringed a hardware patent of Qualcomm Inc and banned sales of iPhones there with chips from Apple supplier Qorvo Inc.  \u201cTwo respected courts in two different jurisdictions just in the past two weeks have now confirmed the value of Qualcomm\u2019s patents and declared Apple an infringer, ordering a ban on iPhones in the important markets of Germany and China,\u201d Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm\u2019s general counsel, said in a statement.  For each of the two Apple entities it won orders against, Qualcomm needs to post a bond of about 668.4 million euros, or $765.9 million, before it can begin proceedings to enforce the order, a move Qualcomm said it would carry out \u201cwithin a few days.\u201d  The smartphone maker said it was appealing the decision, but the order goes into effect as soon as Qualcomm posts the bond.  Apple said it would pull some phones from its stores while it pursued an appeal.  \u201cWe are of course disappointed by this verdict and we plan to appeal,\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cAll iPhone models remain available to customers through carriers and resellers in 4,300 locations across Germany. During the appeal process, iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models will not be available at Apple\u2019s 15 retail stores in Germany. iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR will remain available in all our stores.\u201d  Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with research firm Bernstein, said in a note that Germnany was a small iPhone market for Apple, selling about 10 million units a year, with possibly only half of those being the older models affected by the court\u2019s order.  When Qualcomm posts the bond to enforce the order, it could seek to extend the ban to Apple\u2019s resellers and the newer iPhone models not included thus far, legal experts said.  Qualcomm said the court had granted its request for \u201ca recall and destruction of all accused devices from all retailers in Germany.\u201d  RISKS  But pressing forward with enforcement presents some risks for Qualcomm. In an earlier proceeding before the U.S. International Trade Commission, U.S. regulators viewed a more extensive set of technical evidence about whether Qorvo\u2019s chips and Apple\u2019s phones violated Qualcomm\u2019s patents.  Those U.S. regulators sided with Apple and Qorvo. If higher courts in Germany do the same when Apple appeals, Qualcomm could be forced to forfeit its bond if the decision becomes final.  The German case is Qualcomm\u2019s third major effort to secure a ban on Apple\u2019s lucrative iPhones over patent infringement allegations after similar efforts in the U.S. and China.  In the United States, Qualcomm sought to ban the import of iPhones with chips from Intel Corp. Trade regulators found Apple had infringed one Qualcomm patent, but so far declined to ban the phones with Intel chips because regulators feared it would hurt competition in the chip marketplace.  \u201cCompetition authorities around the world have repeatedly found Qualcomm\u2019s licensing practices unlawful, yet Qualcomm continues to try to achieve the same results through a campaign of patent lawsuits,\u201d Steven Rodgers, Intel\u2019s general counsel, said in a statement after the ruling in Germany.  In Germany, the judge ruled that phones with a chip from Apple supplier Qorvo violate one of Qualcomm\u2019s patents around so-called envelope tracking, a feature that helps mobile phones save battery power while sending and receiving wireless signals.  Mike Baker, Qorvo\u2019s chief intellectual property counsel, said in a statement that U.S. trade regulators had ruled that Qorvo\u2019s chips did not violate the U.S. version of Qualcomm\u2019s patent and that the chip\u2019s inventor wasn\u2019t allowed to testify at the German hearing.  \u201cWe believe our envelope tracking chip does not infringe the patent in suit, and the court would have come to a different conclusion if it had considered all the evidence,\u201d Baker said.  In China, Apple is still pursuing a so-called request for reconsideration with the court that issued the bans.  Apple said its phones remained on sale and it believed it has complied with the Chinese court\u2019s order, but it also made changes to its iPhone software in the wake of the ruling. Qualcomm believes Apple is violating the Chinese court order despite the new software and must stop selling phones there.","17":"Jan 11 (Reuters) - Apple Inc considered tapping Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and MediaTek Inc along with existing vendor Intel Corp to supply modem chips for 2019 iPhones, according to an Apple executive\u2019s testimony at the trial between Qualcomm Inc and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Friday.  Apple for years relied on San Diego-based Qualcomm as the sole supplier of such chips, which help iPhones connect to wireless networks. Starting in 2016, Apple split the business between Intel and Qualcomm, but in 2018, Apple moved solely to Intel for its newest phones.  But Apple supply chain executive Tony Blevins testified on Friday that Apple has also considered MediaTek and Samsung, one of its largest rivals in the smart phone market, to supply the chips.

A woman is reflected in a Apple store logo in San Francisco, California, U.S., August 21, 2017. REUTERS\/Kevin Coombs  Repealing the plan would jeopardize the country\u2019s position in the race for investments in clean energy, particularly its competition with China, Apple said. It was the first public comment by a company on the proposed repeal of the plan, which has never been implemented because of legal challenges.  \u201cRepealing the Clean Power Plan will subject consumers like Apple and our large manufacturing partners to increased investment uncertainty,\u201d the California-based company said in a filing to the agency.  Apple, which says it runs its U.S. operations fully on renewable energy such as wind and solar power, added that repeal of the plan would also threaten development and investments that have already been made in renewable power.  Lisa Jackson, who was the EPA\u2019s chief from 2009 to 2013 under former President Barack Obama, runs Apple\u2019s program to address climate change through renewable energy and energy efficiency.  The opposition from one of America\u2019s biggest and best known companies to Pruitt\u2019s planned repeal comes as the EPA head is battling allegations about his ethics, including that he leased a room in a Washington townhouse co-owned by the wife of energy industry lobbyist.  Pruitt proposed last October to repeal the Clean Power Plan, a set of standards for U.S. states intended to cut pollution from power plants, the largest emitters of greenhouse gases, by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. In December, the EPA launched a comment period for a possible replacement of the plan.  Under Pruitt, the EPA has said the Clean Power Plan was illegal and exceeded the agency\u2019s statutory authority. The plan never went into effect after it was suspended by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. The EPA has not indicated whether or when it would propose a new rule to regulate the emissions.  The proposed repeal is part of Trump\u2019s broader effort to support the coal, oil and natural gas industries and to boost exports of the resources to cut trade deficits.  EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox said in a response to Apple\u2019s filing that the agency appreciates all public feedback and will be considering the comments as part of the rulemaking process.","20":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  MILAN (Reuters) - Italy\u2019s antitrust authority said on Monday it had opened an inquiry into Google Inc, Apple Inc and Dropbox Inc over cloud computing services.  \u201cThe proceedings relate to alleged improper commercial practices and the possible inclusion of unfair clauses in contract conditions,\u201d the authority said in a statement.","21":"LOS ANGELES, June 15 (Reuters) - Apple Inc has signed a multi-year deal with Oprah Winfrey to create programming as part of the iPhone maker\u2019s push into original entertainment, the company said on Friday.  \u201cTogether, Winfrey and Apple will create original programs that embrace her incomparable ability to connect with audiences around the world,\u201d Apple said in a statement.

The iPhone maker\u2019s shares fell 2.3 percent in premarket trading after laser sensor maker Lumentum Holdings Inc slashed its second-quarter forecast, saying a large unnamed customer had materially cut orders, while screen maker Japan Display Inc lowered its full-year outlook on weaker demand from smartphone makers.  The losses pulled down the tech-heavy Nasdaq futures by more than half a percent.  Futures earlier held steady as Brent crude prices rose 1.51 percent after Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest oil exporter, said it would cut its shipments in December.

Lumentum Holdings Inc LITE.O, the main supplier of the Face ID technology in the latest generation of iPhones, cut $70 million off its forecasts for revenue on Monday, knocking another 5 percent, or around $50 billion, off Apple's value in morning trade on Wall Street.  \u201cMany suppliers have lowered numbers because of their unnamed \u2018largest customer,\u2019 which is Apple. Apple got cautious in their guidance and it\u2019s hitting their suppliers,\u201d Elazar Capital analyst Chaim Siegel said.

JP Morgan analysts weighed in by cutting their price target for Apple by $4 to $270 pointing to poor orders for the new iPhone XR.  Three analysts said that Lumentum\u2019s forecast pointed to a reduction of 18 million to 20 million iPhones on earlier estimates, based on average selling prices for 3D sensing parts.  \u201cApple could have accumulated too much Lumentum inventory, and needs to work it off, in which case the unit shortfall is less, although it is still indicative of weak iPhone sales.\u201d D.A.

REUTERS\/Elijah Nouvelage  SAN FRANCISCO\/NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tim Cook\u2019s charm offensive is coming just at the right time. The Apple boss has Washington and even Beijing on his side, while Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg can barely speak without annoying someone in power \u2013 and his company\u2019s apps are blocked in China. Yet since D.C. pressure ratcheted up a year ago, Facebook\u2019s stock has performed better.  Zuckerberg has proved a poor advocate for his company. His assertion of nonpartisanship has fallen on deaf ears, both Republican and Democratic. He has been summoned to testify before Congress twice in the last two years. Last week, his defense of Facebook\u2019s Libra cryptocurrency project failed to allay skeptics\u2019 fears.  Meanwhile, Cook has successfully managed a mercurial Donald Trump. He has met the U.S. president and won tariff exemptions for Apple amid growing import taxes on Chinese goods. Despite accusations that the company\u2019s App Store has anti-competitive elements, Cook hasn\u2019t had to testify in Congress since 2016. Pulling an app used by Hong Kong protestors to track police movements curried favor with Beijing yet didn\u2019t do much damage to the iPhone maker\u2019s reputation.  But Apple\u2019s huge, mature and complex business \u2013 worth over $1 trillion in market capitalization \u2013 means it has to play more defense. Over the last year, Apple\u2019s stock has underperformed the Nasdaq 100 tech index. In the July to September quarter, Apple reported only 2% growth in its top line, and a 2% decline in Greater China sales. IPhone sales in the People\u2019s Republic fell to their lowest level in five years in the period, according to Canalys, while rival Huawei Technologies gained a record 42% market share.  At one time Zuckerberg was besotted with gaining access to China but he has changed his tune. In a recent speech at Georgetown University, he cited Beijing\u2019s censorship policy as a reason. For the time being, he may have lucked out in political terms. The social network still pulled in $5 billion in revenue from Chinese ad sales in 2018, according to Pivotal Research.  More broadly, the $540 billion Facebook\u2019s advertising juggernaut keeps throwing off sales growth. It reported a 29% year-on-year rise in third-quarter revenue to nearly $18 billion, almost all ads. A $5 billion Federal Trade Commission fine imposed in July is a distant memory and its shares have outperformed the Nasdaq benchmark over the last year. Luckily for Facebook, it doesn\u2019t need diplomatic skills like Cook\u2019s as much as Apple does.","28":"Sept 10 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow gave up early gains in volatile trading on Thursday as heavyweights Apple and Microsoft slipped, with investors remaining cautious about a choppy economic rebound from the pandemic-led recession.

The two companies have been locked in a legal dispute since August when the game maker tried to get around Apple\u2019s 30% fee on some in-app purchases on the App Store by launching its own in-app payment system.  That prompted Apple to kick Epic\u2019s Fortnite game off the App Store and threaten to terminate an affiliated account that would have effectively blocked distribution of Unreal Engine, a software tool used by hundreds of app makers to create games.  Epic Games founder and Chief Executive Tim Sweeney said Apple\u2019s control of its platform had tilted the level playing field.  \u201cThe 30% they charge as their app tax, they can make it 50% or 90% or 100%. Under their theory of how these markets are structured, they have every right to do that,\u201d he told reporters.  \u201cEpic is not asking any court or regulator to change this 30% to some other number, only to restore competition on IOS,\u201d he said, referring to Apple\u2019s mobile operating system.  The company also accused Apple of barring rivals from launching their own gaming subscription service on its platform by preventing them from bundling several games together, even though its own service, called Apple Arcade, does that.  Apple said its rules applied equally to all developers and that Epic had violated them.  \u201cIn ways a judge has described as deceptive and clandestine, Epic enabled a feature in its app, which was not reviewed or approved by Apple, and they did so with the express intent of violating the App Store guidelines that apply equally to every developer and protect customers,\u201d the company said in a statement.  \u201cTheir reckless behaviour made pawns of customers, and we look forward to making this clear to the European Commission,\u201d it said.  Apple has been taking small steps in recent months towards changing its practices, including lower fees for some developers and giving them a way to challenge its rulings, both of which have not satisfied the company\u2019s critics.  Fortnite is slated to come back to the iPhone at some point in the mobile Safari browser. Epic and Apple in recent weeks have been trading documents and conducting depositions ahead of a scheduled May trial in Epic\u2019s lawsuit filed last year.  The Commission, which is investigating Apple\u2019s mobile payment system Apple Pay and the App Store, declined to comment on the complaint, saying it was aware of the concerns regarding Apple\u2019s App Store rules.  Epic Games has also complained to the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal and to the Australian watchdog. It has not asked the EU enforcers nor their peers in the UK and Australia for damages.  Big companies such as Microsoft Corp, Spotify and Match Group Inc have also criticised Apple\u2019s App Store fees and rules.

Despite the steep declines in Apple, some hedge fund managers said that they are continuing to add to shares in the company.  \u201cWe know it is not a Facebook or a Google with eye-popping growth but we\u2019re not paying for that,\u201d said Shawn Kravetz, founder of Esplanade Capital, at the Reuters Global Investment 2019 Outlook Summit in New York on Wednesday.  Kravetz, who added to his Apple position Wednesday morning, said investors like himself are attracted to the company\u2019s compelling valuation compared to other Silicon Valley giants.  The declines in Apple may add to what is proving to be another difficult year for the hedge fund industry.  Overall, the average hedge fund dropped nearly 3 percent in October, the worst monthly loss since 2011, in large part due to over-exposures to the technology industry, according to Hedge Fund Research.  Given the increased volatility in the U.S. stock market, defensive-minded funds will likely post the strongest returns through the end of the calendar year, said Kenneth Heinz, president of HFR.  \u201cAnticipating the market volatility which began in September and accelerated in October will continue into 2019, strategies positioned for this transitional market environment are likely to lead performance through year end,\u201d he said.  Quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers\u2019 stock holdings in 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are one of the few public ways of tracking what the managers are selling and buying. But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some risk because the disclosures are made 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions.  The moves into the shares of Apple came at a time when several prominent hedge funds were starting to shed their holdings of the FANG stocks - Facebook Inc FB.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Netflix Inc NFLX.O, and Google's parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O - that had led the market higher over the last two years.

Ant Financial [ANTFIN.UL] is the payment affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  It is not clear how many users were affected by the breach, and Alipay\u2019s statement urged affected users to contact Apple.  The potential breach underscores the security challenges facing China\u2019s huge mobile payments market, where WeChat and Alipay services have become ubiquitous in daily life.  It also highlights the pitfalls facing tech firms in China, where smartphone scams and personal data breaches are more common than other markets.  Apple was chastised by Chinese state media in July for the amount of spam being sent on iMessage, with media saying with the company\u2019s strict stance on privacy was hindering its ability to crack down on illegal behavior.  The company has since said it is contact with telecom companies on how to reduce the amount of spam received through iMessage.  Apple users in China are required to link their IDs to their phone numbers, which are in turn linked to their national identification numbers. Apple Pay, while not as popular as WeChat Pay and Alipay, has also become increasingly popular in China\u2019s large eastern cities.

Apple charges a 30% fee for in-app purchases made through the App Store, a fee that drops to 15% on subscription purchases after one year.  In exchange, Apple handles all the mechanics of billing and payments in more than 100 countries. But in Apple\u2019s response to Spotify\u2019s complaint, Apple said that Spotify does not currently pay a 30% fee for any of its premium users and that only a small fraction are affected by its fees.  Apple said that Spotify used its App Store billing system between 2014 and 2016. Because the 680,000 premium Spotify customers who signed up during that period have all been paying for more than a year, Spotify pays Apple the lower 15% fee on them, Apple said in its response.  Apple also said that Spotify has paid it nothing for premium subscribers who signed up during the past three years because Spotify has not used Apple\u2019s in-app purchase system.  Spotify declined to comment on the figures. Apple filed its response on May 31, but the documents were not made public. German newspaper Der Spiegel earlier reported the figures from Apple\u2019s response.  Spotify\u2019s complaint to regulators also included allegations beyond Apple\u2019s fees, including steps that Spotify said Apple took after it quit using the App Store\u2019s payment mechanism. The company pointed to tightened App Store rules after 2016 that bar app makers from providing links or buttons to external web pages showing users how to pay for an upgrade to premium subscription outside the App Store.  \u201cPromotions are essential to our business. This is how we convert our free customers to premium,\u201d Horacio Gutierrez, Spotify\u2019s general counsel, told Reuters in March.  Spotify also in its complaint said that Apple does not allow Spotify on HomePod, Apple\u2019s smart speaker.","35":"SEOUL, Feb 8 (Reuters) - South Korea\u2019s Hyundai Motor Co and Kia Corp said on Monday they are not in talks with Apple Inc on developing autonomous vehicles.

REUTERS\/Elijah Nouvelage  (Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O on Monday issued new review guidelines for its lucrative App Store platform, after it moved to block plans by Steam, the biggest distributor of PC-based video games, to extend its reach into iPhones and iPads.  Apple uses the guidelines to decide which apps can appear in the App Store. Apple now explicitly says apps cannot host anything that looks like an app store within an app or give users the ability to \u201cbrowse, select, or purchase software not already owned or licensed by the user.\u201d  But the new rules say that so-called remote mirroring apps, which beam the screen of a desktop computer to an iPhone, can allow purchases outside Apple\u2019s control as long as the transactions are processed on the desktop device and not the iPhone.  The move is significant because it shows Apple protecting its practice of taking between 15 percent and 30 percent of the purchase price of software bought in the App Store. The company quietly posted new guidelines on Monday as its annual developer conference was happening in San Jose.  Steam, the dominant online store for downloaded games played on Windows PCs, had planned to release a free mobile phone app called Steam Link so gamers could continue playing on their iPhones while away from their desktop machines.  But Steam\u2019s parent company, the Bellevue, Washington-based Valve Corp, said last week that Apple had rejected the Steam Link app, blocking its release. Neither Steam nor Apple commented last week on why the app was rejected, and neither responded to requests for comment on Monday about whether the new App Store rules were indeed aimed at Steam.  But Apple\u2019s update seemed intended to clarify the rules around what are known as in-app purchases or micro-transactions, in which gamers can spend small sums of money inside games to buy tokens, extra lives or others so-called digital goods.  As with the purchase of apps themselves, Apple takes a 30 percent cut of in-app purchases distributed through its App Store.  Analysts believe those purchases are among the drivers of revenue in Apple\u2019s services business, which includes the App Store, iCloud and Apple Music. In Apple\u2019s most recent quarter, services revenue hit $9.1 billion, beating Wall Street expectations and providing a bright spot for revenue growth as the smartphone market matures.","37":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window.)  * U.S. to delay China tariffs on some products  * Tech leads rally among major S&P sectors  * Apple biggest boost due to iPhone implications  * Only real estate and utilities sectors trade lower  * Indexes up: Dow 1.59%, S&P 1.54%, Nasdaq 1.94% (Changes comment, updates prices)  Aug 13 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks surged more than 1.5% on Tuesday after the Trump administration said it would delay 10% tariffs on some Chinese products, including laptops and cell phones, driving a 4% rally in shares of iPhone maker Apple Inc.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O caught up with hardware rivals on Tuesday by revealing a triple-camera iPhone, and it rolled out a streaming TV service priced at $5 a month, undercutting Disney and Netflix.  The announcements came at the company\u2019s biggest marketing event, where it unveils its top products for the year ahead, and showcased an aggressive Apple ready to battle on price.  The long-awaited Apple TV+ streaming television service will be available in over 100 countries, starting in November. The service will not be available in China when it launches, nor will the Apple Arcade video game subscription.  Buyers of an iPhone, iPad or Mac will get a free year of streaming TV, potentially drawing hundreds of millions of viewers to the service. That catapults the new service into a rarified group of companies.  \u201cI think the pricing on the Apple TV service was definitely a positive surprise,\u201d said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the hammering in some of the other video service-related names like Netflix, Amazon and Roku. Clearly, that was a positive that people were happy to hear.\u201d  There was no bundle with Apple Music or other services as some analysts had expected. But Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, said the TV service, a $5 a month \u201cArcade\u201d gaming service and the base model iPhone 11, seem designed to draw in users for the longer term.  \u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting Apple Arcade and particularly Apple TV to be priced as aggressively as they were,\u201d Bajarin said. \u201cThey know once consumers get into their ecosystem, they don\u2019t leave.\u201d  Apple said its new iPhone 11 will come with two back cameras, including an ultra wide-angle lens and the next generation of microchips, the A13. Prices start at $699, down from last year\u2019s new iPhone that started at $749.  The more expensive iPhone 11 Pro will have three cameras on the back - wide angle, telephoto and ultra-wide. It can create videos with all three back cameras and the front camera at the same time and starts at $999. The iPhone 11 Pro Max with a bigger screen starts at $1,099. The new phones are available to order Friday and will start shipping Sept. 20.  Rivals including Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS already sell phones with three cameras on the back. While Apple once tested the upper limits of what consumers would pay for a phone, it is now giving ground on prices, even making older models available at significant discounts to the latest technology.  \u201cConsumers absolutely still care about cameras. That\u2019s why it was surprising over the last couple of years that Samsung and Huawei got the jump on Apple,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. \u201cApple was playing a bit of catch up, but Apple did bring their game, particularly on the video side of the camera, where I do think they\u2019ll have the leg up.\u201d  Analysts expect Apple will sell around 200 million iPhones in the next year, in addition to other devices, and while many of those will be in China, it ensures at least tens of millions of potential viewers for the subscription service.  Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said Apple\u2019s lower priced iPhones \u201caren\u2019t exciting on the surface, but the low streaming price may suck in some new subscribers.\u201d Apple shares gained 0.8%.

Oct 30 (Reuters) - When Apple Inc reports results on Wednesday, Wall Street expects flat fiscal fourth-quarter sales and lower full-year revenue compared with the prior year, mostly because of declining iPhone sales. Yet Apple\u2019s stock price has hit all-time highs in recent weeks, and its price-to-forward-earnings valuation is higher than it has been since 2010.  Investors and analysts told Reuters that much of the explanation lies in Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook\u2019s skillful management of relationships in Washington, Beijing and Wall Street.  Cook has fostered a relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, dining with him and conveying Apple\u2019s views on tariffs and U.S. manufacturing. He has also kept strong enough relations with Chinese officials to avoid Apple\u2019s becoming a target of explicit retaliation after the U.S. government moved to cut off Huawei Technologies Co - Apple\u2019s arch rival in the premium smartphone market in China - from American technology.  Along the way, Cook has persuaded Wall Street that Apple can transition from the iPhone to a broader constellation of products that includes streaming video and even a credit card, along with accessories like AirPods and the Apple Watch.  Even investors who were already impressed by Cook\u2019s business acumen - he masterminded Apple\u2019s supply chain and operations under the late CEO Steve Jobs - have been pleasantly surprised by Cook\u2019s ability to avoid taking fatal arrows from either side in the U.S.-China trade war.  \u201cWho would have thought he would have been able to thread that needle and deal with the president? It\u2019s a show of an incredible amount of nuance and emotional intelligence to do what\u2019s best for the company,\u201d said Hal Eddins, chief economist for Capital Investment Cos, an Apple shareholder.  China remains a challenge for Apple. Sales there fell sharply early in the current fiscal year when currency fluctuations put iPhones out of reach for many Chinese consumers. Apple cut prices, which helped, but rival Huawei has gained share.  Apple\u2019s share of the Chinese market fell to 5.2% in the calendar third quarter versus 7% a year ago, while Huawei, which sells many more low-cost models than Apple does, saw its market share surge to 42.4% from 24.9% the year before, Canalys data showed.  \u201cA year ago, we were talking about the price pushback in China, and (Apple) contended they were overcoming that,\u201d said Tom Plumb, founder of Wisconsin Capital Management, an Apple shareholder. \u201cNow the real question is whether you\u2019re seeing a cultural shift that would bode poorly for Apple.\u201d  But many Apple investors have likely already priced in a loss of China market share to domestic rivals in the long term.  \u201cIf the industry is worth being in, you should assume that over the course of time it\u2019s going to be dominated by Chinese national champions,\u201d said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan.  Cook has also persuaded investors that services such as Apple TV+, coming next month, will boost sales. Investors are optimistic, but worry that Apple could be drawn into spending battles over Hollywood talent against entrenched rivals such as Walt Disney Co.  \u201cWe\u2019re not huge advocates of them spending huge amounts of cash reserves on content generation,\u201d said John Ham of New England Investment & Retirement Group Inc, which holds Apple shares. \u201cBut as long as they don\u2019t get carried away and start making outsized, egregious deals, then we would support them dabbling in this area.\u201d (Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Greg Mitchell and Leslie Adler)","46":"FILE PHOTO: Customers walk past an Apple logo inside of an Apple store at Grand Central Station in New York, U.S., August 1, 2018.

The purchase caps come just after the hardware maker closed all of its brick-and-mortar stores outside China, as the coronavirus spreads globally and forces lockdowns and limitations on public movement to contain it.  Checks on Apple\u2019s website reveal that in numerous countries, a drop-down menu prevents customers from buying more than two of the same model iPhone, across all models. The last time it did so was in 2007, when the iPhone was first introduced, to stop people from reselling them.  In mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, and Singapore, a message appears above iPhone listings informing customers that purchases will be limited to two devices per order.  Apple declined to comment.  The purchase limits come as Apple braces for a blow due to the coronavirus\u2019 impact on sales, both due to supply chain disruptions and weak demand.  As the illness swept China, Apple closed all of its brick-and-mortar retail outlets in the country, only reopening all of them by March 13. Foxconn 2317.TW, its most important manufacturing partner, temporarily halted operations, though founder Terry Gou has said that production has now returned to normal.  In February, Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote a letter warning investors the company would unlikely meet its initial revenue projections for the its calendar Q1 earnings guidance due to the virus.  Now, while China\u2019s factories have resumed operations, Apple and other hardware companies face weakening demand as the countries around the world shutter retail stores and enforce social distancing.  The coronavirus, which originated in China in late December, has since spread to 178 countries, infecting over 240,000 and killing about 10,000 globally.  On March 13, Apple announced that all of its Apple Stores outside of China would shut down to fight the spread of the virus.  According to Nicole Peng, who tracks the smartphone sector at research firm Canalys, Apple is likely limiting online orders to prevent scalpers from stockpiling devices and re-selling them on the grey market.  \u201cThis happened in the past in Asia when there is a new iPhone launch and scalpers saw an opportunity to sell to mainland China, where the new phones were harder to buy at the time,\u201d she said.  \u201cNow that stores all over the world are closed, online scalpers see a similar opportunity.\u201d","49":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The yen rose against the dollar and euro on Thursday as investors sought the perceived safety of the Japanese currency after a surprise revenue warning from Apple Inc exacerbated concerns about a Chinese and global economic slowdown.

The dollar was 1.18 percent lower against the yen at 107.59 yen, while the euro was 0.73 percent lower against the yen.  \u201cIt certainly looks like another ominous sign,\u201d said Juan Perez, senior currency trader at Tempus Inc in Washington, referring to the dip in U.S. two-year Treasury note yield.  Caution drove investors to the Japanese yen, the traditional go-to currency in times of stress because traders believe the legions of Japanese investors holding money overseas will rush back into Japan when markets are in flux.  \u201cClearly the Japanese yen is a beloved safe-haven asset when the globe seems to be in chaos,\u201d said Perez.  Earlier in the session, the yen rose to as much as 4.4 percent stronger versus the dollar after a flurry of automated orders triggered a massive move in thinly traded Asian markets after Apple\u2019s warning about weak iPhone demand hurt global risk sentiment.  \u201cThe time between New York close and Asian open is notoriously thin as it is, and couple that with a Japan holiday and Apple news that smacked the equity and you had a nice recipe for a sharp JPY rally,\u201d Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies, said in a note.  The greenback weakened as dismal data on U.S. manufacturing activity suggested the economy was probably not immune to slowing growth in China and Europe.  \u201cLast month\u2019s decline was the biggest monthly fall since October 2008 and will only intensify recent concerns in financial markets over the health of the U.S. economy,\u201d Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in London, said in a note.  The dollar\u2019s recent weakness also reflects a shift in investor expectations for U.S. interest rate rises.  Investors will be looking for cues about interest rate hikes from a discussion between Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and former Fed Chairs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke on Friday.  Sterling was 0.18 percent higher against the greenback as worries about the health of the global economy and particularly China prompted investors to avoid currencies considered riskier.  The Canadian dollar strengthened to a nearly two-week high against its U.S. counterpart on Thursday as oil prices rose and the greenback broadly declined.","50":"Aug 4 (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday said Phil Schiller, one of its most publicly visible executives, is leaving his post as senior vice president of worldwide marketing to become an \u201cApple Fellow\u201d but will retain leadership of the App Store.  Greg Joswiak, who previously oversaw marketing of Apple\u2019s products, will take over for Schiller as senior vice president of worldwide marketing, Apple said.  In addition to overseeing the App Store, Schiller, who is known for his on-stage appearances to introduce new Apple products, will continue to oversee Apple\u2019s events.  Schiller joined Apple in 1987 at age 27, experiencing both the company\u2019s struggles in the mid-1990s and its ascendance after the return of co-founder Steve Jobs in 1996.  \u201cI\u2019ll keep working here as long as they will have me. I bleed six colors, but I also want to make some time in the years ahead for my family, friends, and a few personal projects I care deeply about,\u201d Schiller said in statement.  In addition to overseeing all of Apple\u2019s marketing, Schiller guided the company\u2019s products and served as one of the few public faces authorized to speak freely for the company.  In recent years, that has included defending Apple\u2019s App Store, the centerpiece of its $46.3 billion-per-year services business. It has come under criticism from developers who say its fees and rules create an uneven playing field to compete with the iPhone maker. Schiller has overseen the App Store since 2015, after taking it over from Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of internet software and services, who had run it since 2011.  Joswiak is also an Apple veteran who has been with the company for more than 20 years. He oversaw marketing for the original iPod and iPad. In recent years, has taken on an increasing role in Apple\u2019s public events and media interviews. He will report to Chief Executive Tim Cook.

Apple received the \u201csubstantial majority\u201d of the 1.2 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) that Google paid to be the default search engine on a variety of devices in the United Kingdom in 2019, according to the report.  The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority, in its final report investigating online platforms and digital advertising, said the arrangements between Apple and Google create \u201ca significant barrier to entry and expansion\u201d for Google\u2019s rivals in the search engine market. Those rivals include Microsoft Corp\u2019s Bing, Verizon Communications Inc-owned Yahoo and independent search engine DuckDuckGo, all of which also make payments to Apple in exchange for being search engine options on its devices, the report said.  \u201cGiven the impact of preinstallations and defaults on mobile devices and Apple\u2019s significant market share, it is our view that Apple\u2019s existing arrangements with Google create a significant barrier to entry and expansion for rivals affecting competition between search engines on mobiles,\u201d the regulators wrote in the report.  Apple and Google did not immediately return requests for comment.  Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi earlier this year estimated that Apple generates about $9 billion per year globally from licensing arrangements, revenue with gross margins above 90% and with about 80% of the total coming from Google. Apple reports the revenue in its services segment, which investors are looking to for growth as consumers slow the pace of iPhone upgrades.  In the report, the U.K. regulators said enforcement authorities should be given a range of options to address the Apple-Google arrangement, including requiring \u201cchoice screens\u201d in which users decide which search engine to set as a default during device setup or restricting Apple\u2019s ability to monetize default positions.  Apple told the regulators that monetization restrictions would be \u201cvery costly,\u201d according to the report.","52":"* Apple falls on concerns over waning iPhone demand  * Technology sector leads losses  * FAANGs drop more than 3 pct  * Indexes sink: Dow 1.5 pct, S&P 1.5 pct, Nasdaq 2.7 pct (Updates to late afternoon)  NEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq slumped nearly 3 percent and the Dow and S&P fell more than 1 percent on Monday as investors pulled out of Apple and internet shares, while conflicting signals over the state of play between the United States and China on their trade dispute added to caution.  Shares of Apple Inc fell 3.5 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported the company had cut production orders in recent weeks for all three iPhone models launched in September.  The iPhone maker\u2019s stock is now down about 20 percent from a record high in October following a disappointing holiday quarter sales forecast and weak outlooks from several suppliers. The S&P 500 technology index, down 3.5 percent, led sector losses.  Other market leaders - including the \u2018FANG\u2019 stocks - also fell sharply, underscoring the view that their leadership was on shaky ground. Shares of Facebook were down 5.1 percent, Amazon.com was down 4.3 percent, Netflix was down 4.9 percent and Alphabet fell 3.4 percent.  Since the FANG outperformance run peaked on Aug. 30, the group has underperformed the S&P 500 by 16.25 percent. That is their worst underperformance since the first half of 2014 when they underperformed by around 20 percent.  \u201cYou\u2019re seeing that rotation away from tech. Certainly the indexes are much more growth-oriented because of the sheer size of those companies now, and they dominate the indexes. You\u2019re going to have more underperformance of the growth names,\u201d said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.  Over the weekend, Asia-Pacific leaders meeting in Papua New Guinea failed to agree on a communique for the first time, with U.S.-China trade worries on the forefront.  U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said in a blunt speech on Saturday the United States will not back down from its trade dispute with China unless Beijing bows to U.S. demands, dampening Friday\u2019s trade optimism that was fueled by comments from President Donald Trump.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 391.7 points, or 1.54 percent, to 25,021.52, the S&P 500 lost 41.9 points, or 1.53 percent, to 2,694.37 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 195.74 points, or 2.7 percent, to 7,052.14.  Comments by New York Fed President John Williams on Monday that the U.S. central bank is pushing ahead with gradual rate-hike plans next month as it marches toward a more normal policy stance may have added pressure to stocks.  Some investors questioned whether the Fed will be able to continue raising interest rates, possibly harming growth.  Richard Clarida, the Fed\u2019s newly appointed vice chair, said on Friday that U.S. rates are nearing Fed estimates of a neutral rate, which \u201cmakes sense.\u201d  Shares of Apple suppliers were also hit, including Lumentum Holdings Inc, Universal Display Corp, Cirrus Logic Inc and Skyworks Solutions Inc.  The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index, which also includes some Apple suppliers, dropped 3.1 percent, extending losses from the previous session.  Trading volumes were thin in a holiday-shortened week ahead of Thanksgiving on Thursday and a shorter session on Friday which brings slight volatility to markets, traders said.  Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.70-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.88-to-1 ratio favored decliners.  The S&P 500 posted 26 new 52-week highs and 17 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 16 new highs and 140 new lows.

Apple and Epic have been in a legal battle since August, when the maker of the popular game launched its own in-app payment system to circumvent what it called Apple\u2019s monopolistic practices.  Epic in October had filed a motion in advance of Tuesday\u2019s hearing, seeking the dismissal of Apple\u2019s counterclaims of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and conversion, where in Apple had asked for lost App Store fees and other monetary damages.  Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday that U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers threw out those claims and limited Apple\u2019s allegations to its breach of contract counterclaims against Epic.  A judge in October had ruled that Apple could bar Epic\u2019s \u201cFortnite\u201d game from its App Store but must not harm Epic\u2019s developer tools business, including the \u201cUnreal Engine\u201d software, which is used by hundreds of other video games.  \u201cThis is a high-stakes breach of contract case and an antitrust case and that\u2019s all in my view,\u201d Judge Gonzalez Rogers told lawyers, according to Bloomberg News.  \"You can't just say it's independently wrongful,\" Bloomberg quoted bloom.bg\/3pgZDlx the judge as saying to a lawyer for Apple, referring to Epic's conduct. \"You actually have to have facts,\" the judge said, adding that the rest of the breach-of-contract case moves forward.  Apple and Epic did not respond to Reuters\u2019 request for comment. The iPhone maker told Bloomberg that it disagreed with the judge\u2019s decision on Tuesday, adding that it was clear that Epic breached its contract with the company.

Shares of the iPhone maker jumped 5.8% in premarket trading after it said sales in China were steadying and touted how rising demand for its services and accessories helped offset a record drop in iPhone revenue.  The company also announced plans for a new $75 billion share buyback and bumped up its cash dividend by 5%.  The S&P 500 index clocked another record high close on Tuesday and registered its best four-month rally in nearly nine years.  Analysts are now more optimistic on first-quarter earnings growth and expect a 0.7% rise compared with a 2% fall estimated at the beginning of April, according to Refinitiv data.  Besides a largely better-than-expected earnings season, recent gains in shares have also been powered by positive economic data, a dovish Federal Reserve and hints of progress in U.S.-China trade talks.

Other chip stocks also rose with Nvidia Corp, Qualcomm Inc and Micron Technology Inc up between 1% and 1.6%.  CVS Health Corp added 4.5% after the drugstore chain operator and pharmacy benefits manager raised its full-year profit forecast after reporting a rise in quarterly profit.  Shares of Wynn Resorts Ltd gained 1.8% after Massachusetts gaming regulators allowed the casino operator to keep the license for its new casino near Boston with a $35 million fine.

All of the programming is original because, unlike Netflix Inc NFLX.O and the forthcoming Disney+ from Walt Disney Co DIS.N, Apple does not have rights to a back catalog of TV shows and movies.  That makes Apple\u2019s offering relatively slim compared to other online video services. It is also cheaper than competitors at $4.99 per month. And anyone who has purchased an iPhone, iPad, Apple TV device, iPod touch or Mac after Sept. 10 can get a free subscription for one year.  Cook, in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, said he welcomes the wide range of competition in streaming video because he believes it will encourage more people to drop cable television and seek digital entertainment options.  \u201cThat really advantages not only Apple, but everyone in the streaming field,\u201d Cook said.  Launching in more than 100 countries and territories, Apple TV+ will debut with four TV series for adults, an episode of \u201cOprah\u2019s Book Club,\u201d a nature documentary, and three children\u2019s series.

Reaction from TV critics has been mixed, with a 59 percent positive rating as of Thursday on the Rotten Tomatoes website, which aggregates reviews.  The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Daniel Fienberg said the show started with \u201ca brutally dull pilot and a meandering second episode\u201d before picking up steam in later episodes.  Judy Berman of Time magazine called the series \u201ca sophisticated drama with A-list stars that capitalizes on hot topics and hot gossip.\u201d  The first three episodes of a planned 10-episode season debut on Friday.

The changes were disclosed on Tuesday in a regulatory filing detailing Berkshire\u2019s U.S.-listed stock holdings as of June 30.  Investors closely watch Berkshire\u2019s quarterly stock listings for signs about where Buffett and his investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler might see value.  The filings do not say which managers bought which stocks. Berkshire spent $6.08 billion on equities in the quarter.  Berkshire boosted its Goldman stake by 21 percent, owning roughly 13.3 million shares worth $2.92 billion on June 30, up from 11 million shares on March 31.  That stake had its origins in a profitable investment in Goldman preferred stock that Berkshire made during the 2008 financial crisis.  The Teva stake grew 7 percent to 43.25 million American depositary receipts worth about $1.05 billion. Teva\u2019s ADRs rose 1.2 percent after market hours.  Berkshire also said its Apple stake swelled to about 252 million shares worth close to $47 billion, up 5 percent from 239.6 million shares three months earlier.  Berkshire owns roughly 5 percent of Apple, whose market value surpassed $1 trillion last week.  Buffett, who turns 88 on Aug. 30, often buys stock when he cannot find whole businesses to add to Berkshire\u2019s stable of more than 90 companies in the insurance, energy, food and retail, industrial, railroad and other sectors.  The billionaire has gone 2-1\/2 years since completing a major acquisition for Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire.  Several of the portfolio changes affected bank and airline stocks, reflecting Buffett\u2019s usual policy not to own more than 10 percent of a company\u2019s shares.  Berkshire said it sometimes exceeds the 10 percent cap when companies whose stock it owns repurchase their own shares, forcing it to sell some of its holdings.  Buffett does make exceptions, including for longtime holdings American Express Co and dialysis company DaVita Inc.  In Tuesday\u2019s filing, Berkshire reported higher stakes in Axalta Coating Systems Ltd, Bank of New York Mellon Corp, Delta Air Lines Inc, General Motors Co , Liberty Global Plc, Southwest Airlines Inc and US Bancorp.  It reported lower stakes in American Airlines Group Inc , Charter Communications Inc, Phillips 66 , United Continental Holdings Inc and Wells Fargo & Co, and no longer reported a stake in data analytics company Verisk Analytics Inc.

Buffett\u2019s increased stake, which was confirmed by a representative of the billionaire investor, pushed Apple\u2019s shares up as much as 4.2 percent to $184.25, taking the company\u2019s market value to about $906 billion.  Apple declined to comment on Friday.  \u201cIf you look at Apple, I think it earns almost twice as much as the second most profitable company in the United States,\u201d Buffett told CNBC, which first reported the news on Thursday.

REUTERS\/Rick Wilking  Buffett\u2019s commitment to Apple over the past two years has surprised many, given his historical aversion to companies associated with the technology sector.  \u201cI think Apple was much more of a consumer products business,\u201d Buffett had said last May in a Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual shareholders meeting.  Berkshire\u2019s initial investment in Apple was small, suggesting it was made by one of Buffett\u2019s investment deputies. But with the latest stake purchase, it has grown to a massive 240.3 million shares worth $42.5 billion.  In February, Berkshire said its Apple stake grew by about 23 percent since the end of September to roughly 165.3 million shares.  Recently, Berkshire almost sold out its entire investment in IBM Corp and at the same time bought more Apple shares.  \u201cThey are two different types of decisions. And I was wrong on the first one (IBM), and we\u2019ll find out whether I\u2019m right or wrong on the second (Apple),\u201d Buffett had said a year ago.  There may also be another reason for the investment: Berkshire\u2019s cash pile of $116 billion.  The investment company has not made a major acquisition for more than two years and Buffett had said in his latest annual letter that he wanted to acquire one or more \u201chuge\u201d non-insurance companies to reduce Berkshire\u2019s cash and equivalents.  Buying Apple shares partly accomplishes that, even though Buffett would prefer to buy whole companies.  Berkshire typically discloses its largest common stock holdings and percentage stakes in its quarterly and annual reports.  The report for the first quarter is set for release on Saturday morning, just before Berkshire\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett\u2019s hometown.  Up to Friday\u2019s close, Apple stock had risen 9.8 percent since Berkshire disclosed on Feb.14 that it had raised its stake in the company.

Asian and European shares fell sharply, led by a sell-off in technology stocks, and U.S. stock futures pointed to a weaker open on Wall Street, after Apple cut its revenue forecast, its first downgrade in nearly 12 years, blaming weaker iPhone sales in China. The news also jolted currency markets.  Apples shares tumbled in after-hours trade and those listed in Frankfurt were down 8.6 percent in early European deals.  The news sparked a \u2018flash crash\u2019 in holiday-thinned currency markets as growing concerns about the health of the global economy, particularly China, sent investors scurrying into the safe-haven of the Japanese currency. The yen was poised for its biggest daily rise in 20 months.  Apple\u2019s alert followed data earlier this week that showed a deceleration in factory activity in China and the euro zone, indicating the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China was taking a toll on global manufacturing.  Major European bourses opened firmly in negative territory - Frankfurt\u2019s DAX, with its exposure to Chinese trade and tech-heavy constituents, was the biggest faller down as much as 0.8 percent, while Paris\u2019 CAC40 dropped 0.7 and London eased 0.2 percent.  Chipmakers who supply parts to Apple were the worst hit. Shares in AMS, which provides the facial recognition sensors used in the latest iPhones, fell 19.4 percent to the bottom of the STOXX.  U.S. stock futures pointed to another rough start on Wall Street, with Nasdaq E-mini futures down 2.5 percent and S&P 500 E-mini futures off 1.6 percent.  MSCI\u2019s broadest gauge of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.5 percent after an attempt in Asian hours at a bounce. Japanese markets were closed for holidays but Nikkei futures dropped 1.8 percent.  Shares in China and Hong Kong see-sawed between gains and losses as investors waited for Beijing to roll out fresh support measures for the cooling Chinese economy.  \u201cChinese authorities have got the luxury of having control not just of the fiscal parts of the government tool case, but also the monetary parts ... and I suspect the Chinese authorities will use that,\u201d said Jim McCafferty, head of equity research, Asia ex-Japan, at Nomura.  China\u2019s central bank said late on Wednesday it was adjusting policy to benefit more small firms that are having trouble obtaining financing, in its latest move to ease strains on the private sector, a key job creator.  While more fiscal and monetary policy support had been expected in coming months on top of modest measures last year, some analysts wonder if more forceful stimulus will be needed to stabilise the world\u2019s second-largest economy.  Apple\u2019s surprise announcement weighed on tech shares across Asia, most notably in Taiwan and South Korea. An MSCI index of Korean shares lost 1.8 percent and Taiwan shares fell 1.4 percent.  \u2018FLASH CRASH\u2019  Currency markets saw a wild spike in volatility in early Asian trade, with risk aversion pushing the yen sharply higher against the U.S. dollar, breaking key technical levels and triggering stop-loss sales of U.S. and Australian dollars.  The dollar was last 1 percent weaker against the yen at 107.77, having earlier fallen as low as 104.96, its lowest level since March 2018. The Australian dollar at one point hit levels against the Japanese yen not seen since 2011.  The euro was up 0.3 percent, buying $1.1375, and the dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of major rivals, was 0.3 percent weaker at 96.52.  Amid the flight to perceived safety, German government bond yields held close to their lowest in over two years. Germany\u2019s 10-year bond yield was most recently at 0.169 percent, from a low of 0.148 percent on the day.  U.S. crude oil fell 1.8 percent to $45.71 a barrel, and Brent crude was down 1 percent at $54.34. Slowing global growth is expected to coincide with an increase in crude supply, depressing prices.

Eddy Cue, Senior VP of Internet Software, introduces Apple TV during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  The access to Cue is important because Qualcomm alleges talks between executives at Apple and its rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd were central to its decision to cut off Apple from a stream of nearly $1 billion in licensing rebate payments.  Apple sued Qualcomm early last year, contesting the San Diego-based chipmaker\u2019s licensing practices and asking for those rebate payments back. Qualcomm then sued Apple for patent infringement in several countries. As part of the disputes, Qualcomm is also seeking to ban the import of some iPhones it believes are violating its patents.  In the lawsuit in Southern California filed by Apple, Qualcomm has alleged that at a conference in Idaho in 2015, a top Apple executive encouraged Samsung to \u201cget aggressive\u201d in asking South Korean antitrust regulators to pursue action against the chipmaker.  Cook and Cue are regular attendees of a media mogul conference held each year in Sun Valley, Idaho. The Apple executive in question, Qualcomm alleged, explained that a regulatory ruling on Samsung\u2019s home turf would be Samsung\u2019s \u201cbest chance\u201d to force Qualcomm to change its licensing practices.  Qualcomm did not name the Apple executive cited in its filings. However, the conversation between Apple and Samsung is important because Qualcomm alleges it amounted to Apple \u201cwrongfully inducing\u201d a regulatory action against Qualcomm.  Qualcomm said such a move violated a cooperation agreement it had with Apple and that it stopped sending rebate payments to Apple because of that and other violations of the agreement.  Apple has argued in court filings that it cooperated with requests from regulators and that Qualcomm improperly retaliated against it for doing so.  Though Qualcomm is known as a chipmaker, its profit has been driven by a patent licensing business. Some of Qualcomm\u2019s practices caused conflicts with customers such as Apple and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], as well as with regulators in China, Korea and the United States. Qualcomm has begun changing some of those practices to become more \u201cregulator friendly,\u201d its executives have said.  Apple declined to comment, and Samsung and Qualcomm did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","63":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in an Eikon news window.)  * Apple, Alphabet, Amazon drop on news of Senate testimony  * Apple down ahead of expected iPhones launch at 1 pm ET  * U.S. proposes fresh trade talks with China - WSJ  * Energy stocks gain as oil prices push above $80 a barrel  * Indexes: Dow up 0.35 pct; S&P off 0.02 pct, Nasdaq down 0.48 pct (Updates to early afternoon)  By Shreyashi Sanyal  Sept 12 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq fell on Wednesday, weighed down by a drop in Apple on fears of further regulation, while a rise in energy stocks and a report of fresh U.S.-China trade talks helped keep the S&P afloat and boost Dow Industrials.  Six major web and internet service companies, including Apple, are to detail their consumer data privacy practices to a U.S. Senate panel on Sept. 26, raising the specter of the possibility of stricter regulation.

Also helping was the energy sector, which jumped 0.70 percent as Brent crude price pushed above $80 a barrel due to growing concerns over global oil supply.

The bundles are designed to encourage customers to subscribe to more Apple services, which will generate more recurring revenue, according to the report.  Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.  Apple\u2019s services business, which includes iCloud and Apple Music, has been growing at a rapid pace as it adds more digital offerings to diversify its business at a time when iPhone sales start to mature in key geographies.  According to Bloomberg, the company is also developing a new subscription for virtual fitness classes that can be accessed through apps on the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV and will be offered in a higher-end bundle with the rest of its services.  The service would compete with virtual classes offered by companies, including Peloton Interactive Inc and Nike Inc, it added.  With millions of Americans choosing to exercise at home, demand for fitness apps is surging. While Peloton crossed 1 million subscribers in May, Nike said it added 25 million new members in the fourth quarter across its platforms.  Adding to existing services, Apple last year launched an ambitious video-streaming service, called Apple TV+, along with its credit card, a subscription news app and a videogame service.  Shares of Apple have risen nearly 54% this year and are just $16 away from making the iPhone maker the first publicly listed U.S. company to hit a $2 trillion market capitalization.","66":"SHANGHAI\/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc, facing a court ban in China on some of its iPhone models over alleged infringement of Qualcomm Inc patents, said on Friday it will push software updates to users in a bid to resolve potential issues.  FILE PHOTO : An attendee uses a new iPhone X during a presentation for the media in Beijing, China October 31, 2017. REUTERS\/Thomas Peter  Apple will carry out the software updates at the start of next week \u201cto address any possible concern about our compliance with the order\u201d, the firm said in a statement sent to Reuters.  Earlier this week, Qualcomm said a Chinese court had ordered a ban on sales of some older iPhone models for violating two of its patents, though intellectual property lawyers said the ban would likely take time to enforce.  \u201cBased on the iPhone models we offer today in China, we believe we are in compliance,\u201d Apple said.  \u201cEarly next week we will deliver a software update for iPhone users in China addressing the minor functionality of the two patents at issue in the case.\u201d  In a statement, Qualcomm\u2019s general counsel Don Rosenberg said \u201cApple continues to disregard and violate the Fuzhou court\u2019s orders\u201d despite the planned software changes.  \u201cThey are legally obligated to immediately cease sales, offers for sale and importation of the devices identified in the orders and to prove compliance in court,\u201d he said in the statement.  The case, brought by Qualcomm, is part of a global patent dispute between the two U.S. companies that includes dozens of lawsuits. It creates uncertainty over Apple\u2019s business in one of its biggest markets at a time when concerns over waning demand for new iPhones are battering its shares.  Qualcomm has said the Fuzhou Intermediate People\u2019s Court in China found Apple infringed two patents held by the chipmaker and ordered an immediate ban on sales of older iPhone models, from the 6S through the X.  Apple has filed a request for reconsideration with the court, a copy of which Qualcomm shared with Reuters.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  WHERE\u2019S THE HARM?  Qualcomm and Apple disagree about whether the court order means iPhone sales must be halted.  The court\u2019s preliminary injunction, which the chipmaker also shared with Reuters, orders an immediate block, though lawyers say Apple could take steps to stall the process.  All iPhone models were available for purchase on Apple\u2019s China website on Friday.  Qualcomm, the biggest supplier of chips for mobile phones, filed its case against Apple in China in late 2017, saying the iPhone maker infringed patents on features related to resizing photographs and managing apps on a touch screen.  Apple argues the injunction should be lifted as continuing to sell iPhones does not constitute \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to Qualcomm, a key consideration for a preliminary injunction, the copy of its reconsideration request dated Dec. 10 shows.  \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons why in a very complicated patent litigation case the judge would be reluctant to grant a preliminary injunction,\u201d said Yiqiang Li, a patent lawyer at Faegre Baker Daniels.  HIT LOCAL SUPPLIERS  Apple\u2019s reconsideration request also says any ban on iPhone sales would impact its Chinese suppliers and consumers as well as the tax revenue it pays to authorities.  The request adds the injunction could force Apple to settle with Qualcomm. But it was not clear whether this referred to the latest case or their broader legal dispute.  Qualcomm has paid a 300 million yuan ($43.54 million) bond to cover potential damages to Apple from a sales ban and Apple is willing to pay a \u201ccounter security\u201d of double that to get the ban lifted, the copy of the reconsideration request shows.  Apple did not immediately respond to questions about the reconsideration request and Reuters was not independently able to confirm its authenticity.  Yiqiang Li said the case would undoubtedly ramp up pressure on Apple, especially if a ban was enforced.  \u201cI think that Qualcomm and Apple, they always have those IP litigations to try to force the other side to make concessions. They try to get their inch somewhere.

In the two decades since, Apple has risen to become the most valuable company in the world by helping popularize yet another era in computing, the smart phone.

IPhone sales marked their steepest decline ever, falling 17 percent in the fiscal second quarter from a year earlier and slightly missing analyst expectations. But Apple executives said a pickup in iPhone sales toward the end of the second quarter, along with growth in sales of services and wearable devices, made them optimistic about the current quarter.  Apple said it expects revenue between $52.5 billion and $54.5 billion for the current quarter ending in June, above analysts\u2019 average estimate of $51.93 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Apple said iPhone revenues were $31.05 billion, slightly below analyst estimates of $31.10 billion, according to data from FactSet.  Services revenue, which includes sales from Apple Music, the App Store and other businesses, reached $11.45 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $11.32 billion, according to FactSet.  Apple has wrestled with a slowdown in iPhone sales in key markets such as China and saw its first ever year-over-year decline in iPhone revenue for the holiday shopping season.  The slowdown stemmed in part from the iPhone\u2019s high cost and competition from rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd , Xiaomi Corp, Oppo and Vivo - all of which sell cheaper phones with features similar to the iPhone.  But Cook said price adjustments in China, along with lower Chinese taxes on the iPhone and the trade-in and financing deals Apple offered, helped iPhone sales start to recover toward the end of the quarter. Cook also said he is \u201coptimistic\u201d that the United States and China will soon reach a trade deal.  \u201cThe trade relationship, versus the previous quarter, is better.

Fueling its stellar run has been Chief Executive Tim Cook's push to turn Apple's loyal client base into a source of steady services revenue, including streaming video and a credit card launched last year with Goldman Sachs GS.N.  Also supporting Apple\u2019s stock is excitement around an eventual pickup in iPhone demand with the rollout of 5G wireless technology, and low interest rates that have broadly helped Wall Street.  Shares of Apple fell 2.9% on Monday from record highs as fears about the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak in China hit Wall Street. Analysts on Apple\u2019s quarterly earnings call after the bell on Tuesday will listen for comments concerning the impact on its manufacturing operations in China.Apple\u2019s market capitalization briefly exceeded $1.4 trillion last Wednesday for the first time, but it has yet to end a session at that level. Some investors worry that Apple\u2019s rally, and surging earnings multiple, may have become overextended.  \u201cThe run-up in the stock is a concern, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we see a bit of a pullback in the near future,\u201d said People\u2019s United Advisors chief equity strategist John Conlon, who added that Apple\u2019s services business has become his main reason for owning stock.  Following its recent rally, Apple\u2019s stock is trading at the equivalent of 23 times expected earnings, its highest multiple since 2010, according to Refinitiv. Apple\u2019s average PE over the past decade was about 14, lagging other high-growth companies with recurring revenue and reflecting its singular dependence on iPhones sales and reliance on persuading consumers to upgrade their phones year after year.  Salesforce.com CRM.N and Netflix NFLX.O, which rely on recurring revenue, are trading at over 55 times expected earnings. Tech hardware sellers Intel INTC.O and Cisco Systems CSCO.O are at about 14 times expected earnings.  Apple is on track to reach a goal to double its 2016 services revenue to $48.7 billion by the end of fiscal 2020 as it focuses on selling high-margin subscriptions to its user base. Many investors envision an increasingly rosy future for its earnings, a trend reflected in its soaring earnings multiple.  Adding to existing services including cloud storage, the App Store and music, Apple last year launched an ambitious video streaming service, along with its credit card, a subscription news app and a videogame service.  Apple has also increased the emphasis on its AppleCare, its extended warranty program. For example, the iPhone\u2019s \u201csettings\u201d now includes reminders encouraging people to buy or renew their AppleCare plans.  In the September quarter, Apple said its services revenue hit $12.51 billion, topping analysts expectations of $12.15 billion. Services accounted for 20% of total revenue in that quarter, up from 17% in the same quarter the year before.  Apple also gave cost of sales data showing gross margins for its services segment rose to 64% from a 61% a year earlier. That is far more generous than Apple\u2019s overall gross margin of around 38% in recent years.  Still, for a business segment getting the most attention from Wall Street, Apple provides limited details. Apple\u2019s quarterly reports break out sales of iPhones, Macs and iPads, but a breakdown of results from products falling within the services category so far has not been released.  Apple\u2019s recent strong stock performance has been perpetuated by fund managers buying its shares in order to avoid underperforming their benchmarks, a trend that could reverse when the recent rally ends, Cowen analyst Krish Sankar wrote in a client note last week.  For the fiscal first quarter, which ended in December, analysts on average expect services revenue to jump 19.7% to $13.0 billion, according to Refinitiv.  Overall quarterly revenue is expected to rise 5.0% to $88.5 billion, with adjusted net income inching up 1.5% to $20.3 billion and earnings per share of $4.55.","78":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O said on Tuesday it has closed retail stores across the world until further notice, except in Greater China, as companies try to contain the spread of the coronavirus.

REUTERS\/Robert Galbraith  (Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O on Wednesday said it would quit its default practice of retaining audio recordings of the requests users make to its Siri personal assistant and limit human review of what audio it does collect to its own employees rather than contractors.  The changes come after Apple earlier this month paused a program called Siri grading in which humans listened to audio recordings of users to determine whether the assistant had responded appropriately to requests to do things like read unread messages or upcoming calendar appointments.  Apple put the program on hold after the Guardian newspaper reported that contractors working on Apple\u2019s behalf regularly heard confidential information, drug deals and couples having sex.  Increased public and political scrutiny of data privacy practices have forced greater transparency from Silicon Valley companies, with Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google pausing reviews of audio recordings from its Google assistant service for all purposes in all languages after a leak of Dutch audio data.  Apple has promoted its privacy practices in an effort to distance itself from its rivals and has taken steps since Siri\u2019s introduction in 2011 to limit data collection. Audio recordings are deleted after a set period of time, users were identified by a random number, and data such as a user\u2019s unread messages or calendar appointments were not sent to Apple\u2019s servers.  But Apple tapped humans to improve the service, a process that the company\u2019s researchers have in the past told Reuters can cut speech recognition error rates in half. Apple says the number of audio recordings reviewed was small - less than 0.2% of total requests - but users had no way to opt out of having audio retained and reviewed by humans except turning Siri off altogether.  Apple on Wednesday said that it will quit keeping audio for human review and instead let users opt in to having their audio reviewed if they choose. The company said it will still use computer-generated transcripts to improve Siri.  Apple also said that it will let only employees review the audio and that it \u201cwill work to delete any recording which is determined to be an inadvertent trigger of Siri.\u201d  Apple said the pause on the program will remain in place until the changes are carried out but did not give a date.","80":"* Prospects of Sino-U.S. trade thaw dim over weekend  * Dollar subdued as Fed talks about global risks  * European stocks struggle with car woes  * Wall Street hit by Apple slide, trade woes (Updates to mid-afternoon in U.S. markets, changes comment)  NEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - World stocks fell on Monday as worries about softening demand for the iPhone dragged down shares of Apple Inc and persistent trade tensions between China and the United States sapped investor sentiment.  Concerns about slowing economic growth also pushed down the dollar.  The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index dropped as much as 2 percent following a decline in shares of Apple and its suppliers. The Wall Street Journal reported Apple had cut production orders in recent weeks for the iPhone models it launched in September.  Renewed tensions between China and the United States also weighed. At an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperative meeting in Papua New Guinea over the weekend, the issue prevented leaders from agreeing on a communique, the first time such an impasse had occurred in the group\u2019s history.  U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said in a blunt speech on Saturday that there would be no end to U.S. tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods until China changed its ways.  \u201cWe\u2019re just in an uncertain period for the economy, largely because of trade and trade issues,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. \u201cIf (U.S. President) Trump came out and said he was very optimistic about the G20 meeting, or if (Chinese President) Xi came out and said that, this market would turn on a dime.\u201d  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 405.46 points, or 1.6 percent, to 25,007.76, the S&P 500 lost 42.58 points, or 1.56 percent, to 2,693.69 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 196.26 points, or 2.71 percent, to 7,051.61.  MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.89 percent.  Mixed signals regarding the Federal Reserve\u2019s course of rate hikes in the face of a potential economic slowdown has also weighed on markets, investors said.  Federal Reserve policymakers have recently raised concern about a potential global slowdown, leading some market watchers to suspect the tightening cycle may not have much further to run.  Data released on Monday by the National Association of Home Builders showed weakening sentiment in the U.S. housing market, adding to concerns over economic growth.  Still, New York Fed President John Williams stated that the U.S. central bank is moving ahead with its plans for gradual rate hikes as it marches toward a more normal policy stance.  Reflecting growth concerns and the possibility that the Fed\u2019s tightening cycle may soon end, the dollar dropped to a two-week low on Monday. The dollar index fell 0.28 percent.  In similar fashion, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit its lowest level in more than a month. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 4\/32 in price to yield 3.0592 percent, from 3.074 percent late on Friday.

The cut underscores the bleak outlook for electronics makers and comes a week after another Apple Inc AAPL.O supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) 2330.TW, also scaled back its revenue and investment estimates.  \u201cIt is a conservative approach resulting from uncertainty around the mobile market,\u201d Don Kim, LG\u2019s chief finance officer, told an earnings conference call, referring to the capex reduction.  LG shares tumbled 7 percent versus the broader market's .KS11 0.3 percent fall after it flagged faster-than-expected panel price declines and an uncertain outlook.  \u201cMarket conditions are turning favorable, but still the unpredictability is high,\u201d Kim added. \u201cOversupply and asymmetrical competition are unavoidable.\u201d  LG said it would trim investment by 3 trillion won ($2.7 billion) from what was planned by 2020, without revealing its total or previous capex targets. It also warned that it could adjust production in South Korea and China in response to trade disputes between Washington and Beijing.  The investment cut would not impact plans to \u201cspeed up the shift\u201d from LG\u2019s mainstay liquid crystal display (LCD) business toward next-generation organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels, the company said.  Plans to invest about 20 trillion won in OLED panels by 2020 remained unchanged, meaning the cuts would apply mainly to LCD operations.  The OLED panel business has yet to make a profit for LG but the company said it would be positive for earnings in the third quarter. LG is focused on investing in OLED technology, with strong positions in large OLED TV screens.

REUTERS\/Kim Hong-Ji\/File Photo  The shift comes as its traditional LCD business, which analysts estimate makes up more than 90 percent of LG\u2019s sales, is struggling with falling prices as fast-growing Chinese panel makers ramp up their capacity.  Prices of 50-inch LCD panels slid 38 percent in May versus the same month last year, according to South Korean government data.  \u201cLCD industry is already in a down-cycle, which will be difficult for LG to get away from, so LG will concentrate more on OLED to differentiate,\u201d said John Ko, analyst at NH Investment & Securities.  LOSSES MOUNT  LG Display posted an operating loss of 228 billion won ($202.1 million), hit by declining panel prices, compared with an average forecast of a 247 billion won loss derived from a Thomson Reuters survey of 11 analysts.  Revenue for the April-June quarter fell 15 percent from a year earlier to 5.6 trillion won.  It was LG Display\u2019s second consecutive quarterly loss amid an uncertain time for the global panel industry, with Chinese manufacturers ramping up capacity and a glut of LCD output crimping prices and profit margins.  A structural oversupply in panels and fierce competition among display makers were expected to continue, LG said in a statement.  China recently approved an LG joint venture to run a new OLED factory there, as the company tries to expand its OLED business towards Chinese TV makers.

Apple and Epic have been in a legal battle since August, when the maker of the popular game launched its own in-app payment system to circumvent what it called Apple\u2019s monopolistic practices. Apple\u2019s App Store requires developers to use Apple\u2019s payment system and pay a 30% commission.  Apple blocked Epic\u2019s ability to distribute updates or new apps through the App Store, and Epic sued Apple alleging that its App Store practices violate antitrust laws. The court allowed Apple to block Epic from distributing new titles as the case plays out, but the existing version of \u201cFortnite\u201d still works, as does Epic\u2019s payment system.  Apple had said it would allow \u201cFortnite\u201d back into the store if Epic removed the direct payment feature to comply with its developer agreement. But Epic has refused, saying complying with Apple\u2019s request would be \u201cto collude with Apple to maintain their monopoly over in-app payments on iOS.\u201d  Apple\u2019s filing on Tuesday asks for monetary damages for Epic\u2019s payment system, seeking \u201crestitution and disgorgement of all earnings, profits, compensation, benefits, and other ill-gotten gains obtained by Epic as a result of its conduct.\u201d  Apple did not specify how much money it was seeking over the payment feature.

The Halo band, which does not feature a display screen unlike most of its rivals, is priced at $99.99, while the app membership costs $3.99 per month, Amazon said.  The scope of growth in the fitness band market has prompted tech giants such as Apple Inc and Samsung to introduce many sophisticated features for health tracking, including electrocardiogram and blood pressure sensor.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The European Commission is drafting a new regulation specifically targeting online platforms such as e-commerce sites, app stores and search engines that will require the companies to be more transparent about how they rank search results and why they delist some services.  The proposal seeks to address potentially harmful trading practices by online platforms and a lack of effective redress mechanisms for smaller businesses that use them to reach consumers.  \u201cOnline intermediation services can hold superior bargaining power over their business users, enabling them to behave unilaterally in a way that is capable of harming the businesses using them,\u201d the draft regulation, seen by Reuters, says.  Tech companies have faced significant regulatory pressure from Brussels, be it over their handling of swathes of user data, how much they pay in taxes or the proliferation of extremist content on social media.  The proposal was initially meant to exclude search engines such as Alphabet Inc's Google and Microsoft's Bing MSFT.O, but these will now be included given the impact a business's ranking in search results can have on its revenues.  The EU\u2019s antitrust chief in June hit Google with a record 2.42 billion euro ($2.99 billion) fine for favoring its own shopping service over those of rivals.  Under the proposal, operators of search engines, app stores as well as e-commerce sites such as eBay EBAY.O will have to specify upfront the \"most important parameters determining ranking\", such as \"specific signals incorporated into algorithms\" and adjustment or demotion mechanisms.  The proposal will not force companies to disclose their algorithms but just provide descriptions at a general level explaining \u201chow and to what extent the relevant ranking mechanism takes account of the quality of the products and services offered\u201d.  Online platforms will also have to implement a notice period of at least 15 days for changes to their terms and conditions as well as provide businesses with an \u201cindividualized\u201d description of the reasons for which they have been de-listed or suspended - for example from Apple\u2019s App Store or Google Play.  Where companies have their own services competing with other businesses on their platforms - for example Google\u2019s own comparison shopping service in Google search results - their terms and conditions will have to include a description of any preferential treatment they give to their own service including access to consumer data and ranking.  The proposal is expected to be published in April, after which it will have to be agreed by national governments and the European Parliament.

FILE PHOTO: A Qualcomm sign is shown outside one of the company's many buildings in San Diego, California, U.S., September 17, 2020. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  The deal marks a big push by Qualcomm to reestablish a leading position in chip performance after several years of high-profile patent licensing litigation with rival Apple and regulatory authorities.  It also comes amid a change in the helm with Qualcomm announcing this month that Cristiano Amon, its current president and head of its silicon division, will replace outgoing CEO Steven Mollenkopf, effective June 30.  Founded by three of Apple\u2019s former top semiconductor executives in charge of iPhone chips, Nuvia has been working on a custom CPU core design that it had said would be used in server chips.  Qualcomm, however, plans a broad use of Nuvia\u2019s processors, saying they would power flagship smartphones, next-generation laptops, infotainment systems and driver-assistance systems among other applications.  While laptop makers have traditionally turned to Intel Corp for processors, Qualcomm has been supplying PC chips for several years to firms such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Microsoft Corp.  \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see Nuvia join the Qualcomm team,\u201d Panos Panay, Microsoft\u2019s chief product officer, said in a statement on the deal. \u201cMoving forward, we have an incredible opportunity to empower our customers across the Windows ecosystem.\u201d  The deal is also significant because it could help lessen Qualcomm\u2019s reliance on Arm Ltd, which is being purchased by Qualcomm rival Nvidia Corp for $40 billion.  Most of Qualcomm\u2019s current chips use computing cores licensed directly from Arm, while Nuvia\u2019s cores use Arm\u2019s underlying architecture but are custom designs. For Qualcomm, using more custom core designs - a move that Apple has also made - could lower some licensing costs to Arm in the short term and make it easier to move to a rival architecture in the longer term.  While Qualcomm and Apple have resolved disputes over Qualcomm\u2019s patent royalties, Nuvia and Apple have been at loggerheads.  In 2019, Apple sued Nuvia\u2019s Chief Executive Gerard Williams III, alleging Williams recruited Apple employees to Nuvia while he was still employed at Apple. Apple did not sue Nuvia itself, nor did it allege any intellectual property theft, and no trial date has been set.","93":"FILE PHOTO: Apple's 5G iPhone 12 and iPhone 11 are seen at an Apple Store, as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak continues in Shanghai China October 23, 2020.

Apple, which stopped disclosing iPhone unit sales data two years ago, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment, but the report comes at a time when analysts are debating the likely extent of a boost from its launch of 5G handsets.  The company, which in October recorded the steepest decline in handset sales in at least three years, has said it expected iPhone revenue growth to be in single digits in the current quarter, the first of its 2021 fiscal year.  The company\u2019s shares rose 3% to $125.44 in morning trading.  Nikkei also said Apple plans to build up to 230 million iPhones in total next year, a 20% rise from 2019, though the target will be regularly reviewed and revised in response to consumer demand.  Apple shares have soared in the past two years as it successfully diversified its revenue streams toward accessories, services and a broader range of hardware, lessening its dependence on the iPhone.  The phones, however, which have powered a new era of success for the company since their launch by former Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs in 2007, make up just over 40% of revenue.  The company is currently working on a new Apple TV model and preparing an aggressive 2021 production schedule for its MacBook Pro and iMac Pro, Nikkei added.","94":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window.)  * Apple shares jump on upbeat earnings, forecast  * Modest drop in U.S. borrowing costs widely expected  * Futures up: Dow 0.25%, S&P 500 0.17%, Nasdaq 0.38%  By Shreyashi Sanyal  July 31 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures edged higher on Wednesday, as trade worries eased after Apple reported upbeat earnings and forecast, while investors awaited an almost certain cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.  The iPhone maker beat quarterly profit and revenue expectations, and forecast strong sales for the current quarter. Apple\u2019s greater China sales dipped only slightly, assuaging concerns that trade tensions were undermining the company\u2019s standing in one of its most important markets.  The Nasdaq 100 e-minis pointed to a 0.4% rise for the tech-heavy index, helped by Apple\u2019s 4.3% jump in premarket trading.  The U.S.-China trade talks concluded on Wednesday without any major breakthrough and the Chinese commerce ministry said the two sides will meet again in the United States in September.  This comes a day after President Donald Trump warned Beijing against trying to wait out his first term in office to finalize a deal, sending jitters through global financial markets.  Meanwhile, market participants are expecting a quarter-percentage-point cut in borrowing costs by the U.S. central bank. All eyes will now be on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who is set to hold a news conference after the rates decision at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), to explain why the move was necessary and what comes next.  \u201cIt\u2019s Fed day and investors will ponder the language of the communique as a 25 basis point cut is already expected,\u201d said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.  Wall Street\u2019s main indexes have had a strong run since a steep selloff in May, with the S&P 500 index now up 20% for the year as investors hoped that a modest rate cut would help combat slowing growth and boost tame inflation.  At 7:14 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 67 points, or 0.25%. S&P 500 e-minis were up 5.25 points, or 0.17% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 30 points, or 0.38%.  Also on the radar was the ADP National Employment Report due at 8:15 a.m. ET, often considered a precursor to the Labor Department\u2019s more comprehensive monthly non-farm payrolls data.  It is expected to show private employers added 150,000 jobs last month, compared to an addition of 102,000 jobs in June. The Labor Department\u2019s jobs report for the month of July is due on Friday.  Among other stocks, Electronic Arts Inc rose 6.7% after the video game publisher posted quarterly revenue beat, riding on the continued success of its battle royale game \u201cApex Legends\u201d.  Advanced Micro Devices Inc\u2019s shares fell 5% after it forecast third-quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates, hit by lower demand for its chips used in gaming consoles.  Its downbeat forecast weighed on Micron Technology, Nvidia Corp and Intel Corp, which were trading down between 0.4% and 1.5%.  General Electric Co\u2019s shares rose 5% after the industrial conglomerate said it has started a search for a new chief financial officer following the exit of Jamie Miller. The company also said it swung back to a financial loss during the second quarter.

Apple jumped 3.9 percent to a record high of $183.80 after Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway raised its stake in the iPhone maker.  The S&P technology sector was up 1.64 percent, the biggest driver on the index.  The markets were off to a choppy start after data showed the U.S. economy added 164,000 jobs in April, but missed estimates, while the unemployment rate dropped to near a 17-1\/2-year low of 3.9 percent.  The Labor Department\u2019s closely watched report showed wage growth of only 0.1 percent in April, also below expectations, easing concerns that inflation pressures were increasing.  \u201cWe have a jobs report that shows continued strength in the labor market, though without any real inflationary pressures through wages,\u201d said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.  \u201cIt\u2019s sort of the Goldilocks economy, where there is enough strength in the labor market to allow the Fed to raise interest rates, but not enough to require them to do so.\u201d  After choppy futures trading following release of the data, Wall Street opened lower, before reversing course. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 bounced off their 200-day moving averages, a technical level that indicates long-term momentum.

All the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, and 29 of the 30 Dow members were in the black.  After a two-day meeting, China and the United States reached a consensus on some aspects of their trade row, though some \u201crelatively big\u201d disagreements on other issues remained, China said.  Among companies that reported results, Pandora Media jumped 22.4 percent after the music streaming service provider reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss.  CBS Corp rose 5.9 percent after the media company topped revenue and profit estimates for the first quarter.  Fluor Corp sank 21.7 percent, the most on the S&P, after the engineering and construction company posted a surprise quarterly loss due to issues with a gas-fired power project.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 3.25-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 2.70-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The British company joins a list of firms in Apple\u2019s supply chain that have warned on their profits, pointing to weakness in iPhone sales.  IQE, which had already warned on results on Monday without issuing numbers, said it now expects to earn about 31 million pounds ($39.92 million) for the full year.  The company did not name the chipmaker, but is a major supplier to U.S.-based Lumentum Holdings Inc LITE.O which slashed its forecasts on Monday and said that one of its largest customers would \"materially reduce\" shipments for the current quarter.  Lumentum is the main supplier of the Face ID technology in the latest generation of iPhones, and IQE supplies wafers or thin layers of silicon-based material used in making computing chips to the U.S. company.  The company said on Tuesday that inventory buildup due to slower demand for 3D sensing technology would affect the company.  IQE\u2019s shares closed down nearly 29 percent on Monday after its warning.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple is acquiring the goodwill of flag-waving magazine publishers for less than pocket change. The $925 billion iPhone maker is buying Texture, a digital subscription service for titles like Rolling Stone. The pixelated newsstand was intended as an antidote to Apple\u2019s onerous terms. With the print industry suffering, though, buying it makes the tech giant look like a white knight.  Almost a decade ago, Apple was courting media firms as it prepared to launch the iPad. Yet publishers were wary. Top of mind was the music industry\u2019s quick decline thanks to the astounding success of the iPod and iTunes. In response, magazine bosses wanted to keep access to vital subscriber data.  Hence Next Issue Media was formed by a group of magazine companies including Conde Nast and Hearst and in 2010 launched what has since been named Texture. The service is billed as the Netflix of magazines, allowing subscribers to tap around 200 titles such as Vanity Fair for one monthly fee.  The effort hasn\u2019t noticeably boosted the fortunes of its owners, which are suffering under tremendous pressures. Advertisers are fleeing print, compounding the effects of cheap subscriptions. Moody\u2019s figures ad revenue for U.S. magazines declined 62 percent to $7.4 billion in 2017 from $19.5 billion in 2007.  There\u2019s a newer threat in town anyway: Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s social network, which is under intense scrutiny for amplifying fake news, has been siphoning off advertising revenue from traditional news outlets. Apple executive Eddy Cue said the deal signals a commitment \u201cto quality journalism from trusted sources.\u201d  Playing white knight has another advantage beyond mending fences. Services revenue is one of the fastest-growing business lines for the tech giant, rising 18 percent to $8.5 billion last quarter. Selling magazines, however cheaply, keeps those fees rolling in.","98":"LOS ANGELES, March 18 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc will not make its programming available through a coming TV service expected to be unveiled by Apple Inc, Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings said on Monday.  \u201cWe prefer to let our customers watch our content on our service,\u201d Hastings told reporters at a briefing at the company\u2019s offices in Hollywood.

The two Silicon Valley companies make the world\u2019s dominant smartphone operating systems for iPhones and Android devices.  They will work together on technology that will allow mobile devices to trade information via Bluetooth connections to alert people when they have been in close proximity with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, the sometimes deadly respiratory disease associated with the novel coronavirus.  The technology will first be available in mid-May as software tools available to contact tracing apps endorsed by public health authorities. However, Apple and Google also plan to build the tracking technology directly into their underlying operating systems in the coming months so that users do not have to download any apps to begin logging nearby phones.  The companies said the technology will not track the location or identity of users, but instead will only capture data about when users\u2019 phones have been near each other, with data being decrypted on the user\u2019s phone rather than the companies\u2019 servers. GPS location data is not part of the effort, the companies said.  Governments worldwide have been scrambling to develop or evaluate software meant to improve the normally labor-intensive process of contact tracing, in which health officials go to recent contacts of an infected person and ask them to self-quarantine or get tested.  Several health technology experts have said the involvement of Apple and Google would be a massive boost to their efforts, as contact tracing apps from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and others struggled to make their apps work across competing operating systems.","100":"FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc. logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, New York, U.S., October 16, 2019.

The actions by the two Silicon Valley companies mean that the network seen as a haven for people expelled from Twitter could become unavailable for new downloads on the world\u2019s main mobile phone app stores within a day. It would still be available in mobile browsers.  Right-leaning social media users in the United States have flocked to Parler, messaging app Telegram and hands-off social site Gab, citing the more aggressive policing of political comments on mainstream platforms such as Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc. Twitter permanently suspended President Trump\u2019s account on Friday.  In suspending the service, Google, whose software powers Android phones, cited its policy against apps that promote violence and gave recent examples from Parler, including a Friday post that began \u201cHow do we take back our country? About 20 or so coordinated hits\u201d and another promoting a \u201cMillion Militia March\u201d on Washington.  Parler Chief Executive John Matze said in a post on Friday that Apple was applying standards to Parler that it did not apply to itself.  In a statement, Google said that \u201cfor us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content. In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app\u2019s listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues.\u201d  In a letter from Apple\u2019s App Store review team to Parler seen by Reuters, Apple cited participants of the mob storming the U.S. Capitol building on Wednesday.  \u201cContent that threatens the well-being of others or is intended to incite violence or other lawless acts has never been acceptable on the App Store,\u201d Apple said in the letter.

Those who have joined include commentator Candace Owens, Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and right-wing activist Laura Loomer, who handcuffed herself to the door of Twitter\u2019s New York office in Nov. 2018 to protest a ban on her by the site. In November, conservative activist Rebekah Mercer confirmed that the she and her family, which includes her father and hedge-fund investor Robert Mercer, have provided funding to Parler.  \u201cApparently they believe Parler is responsible for ALL user generated content on Parler,\u201d Matze said. \u201cTherefor (sic) by the same logic, Apple must be responsible for ALL actions taken by their phones.

Like the Big Tech companies, the would-be intervenors question the lawfulness of the USPTO\u2019s \u201cNHK-Fintiv\u201d rule \u2013 a list of factors the agency has decided are relevant when considering whether to review the validity of a patent that is also being litigated in court. However, the tech giants only seek to block the use of the NHK-Fintiv factors. US Inventor\u2019s motion seeks to compel the USPTO to adopt standards via formal regulation - and to shut down the agency\u2019s review of existing patents until the regulatory process is completed, Friday\u2019s ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Davila said. Apple and the other tech companies \u201cdefined the general scope of the suit and the Proposed Intervenors cannot now by intervention radically alter that scope to create a much different case,\u201d Davila wrote. Google attorney Daniel Shvodian of Perkins Coie declined to comment on Monday. Apple, Cisco and Intel are represented by attorneys at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, who did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The proposed intervenors\u2019 attorneys at Flachsbart & Greenspoon and Hudnell Law Group also had no immediate response. The tech companies sued then-USPTO Director Andrei Iancu in federal court in San Jose last August, after the agency\u2019s Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) declared its 2018 decision in NHK and its March decision in Fintiv to be precedential. In NHK, the PTAB decided it was inefficient to institute an inter partes review (IPR) when trial was imminent in a parallel patent-infringement case in federal court. In Fintiv, the PTAB spelled out six litigation-related factors it would consider when deciding whether to institute IPR. Apple and the other tech companies argue that the litigation-related factors are not authorized by the America Invents Act of 2011, which created the IPR process, and that the new rule creates \u201cunjustifiable and unpredictable disparities among similarly-situated IPR petitioners.\u201d The complaint also alleges that the rule is \u201cprocedurally invalid.\u201d US Inventor \u2013 joined by 360 Heros, Larry Golden, World Source Enterprises, Dareltech, Tinnus Enterprises, Clearplay and E-Watch \u2013 filed a motion to intervene in the suit in September. They do not oppose the NHK-Fintiv factors, but argue that the USPTO should adopt standards via a formal rulemaking process after publication and a comment period. The USPTO published a request for comments in October, as a result of an August petition by US Inventor. In addition to its motion to intervene, US Inventor sought a restraining order and injunction to block the USPTO from \u201cgranting institution in any AIA patent trial\u201d until the rulemaking process is finished. Those collateral issues would \u201cunduly delay and prejudice the adjudication of the original parties\u2019 case,\u201d Davila held. On Feb. 12, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is scheduled to hear an unrelated challenge to the NHK-Fintiv rule. In that case, Viatris Inc (formerly Mylan Pharmaceuticals) claims the rule was unconstitutionally applied to its petition for review of a Janssen Pharmaceutica patent.

On the economic front, U.S. consumer prices rose less than expected in August and underlying inflation pressures also appeared to be slowing, a report from the U.S. Labor Department showed.  \u201cTame inflation data is a net positive for markets and this shouldn\u2019t change the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision for two further rate hikes this year,\u201d Antonelli added.  Two S&P sectors were trading lower, with the defensive consumer staples dropping 0.5 percent as shares of Kroger weighed the most on the sector.  Kroger slid 10.2 percent and was the biggest decliner on the S&P after the supermarket chain\u2019s same-store sales missed estimates as customers were put off by changes in how it stocked merchandise.

At a glitzy launch in the German city of Munich, the Chinese firm said its new Mate 30 Pro and Mate 30 devices were more compact, their cameras more sensitive, and wraparound screens more vivid than those of the latest Apple iPhone.  Connectivity was 50% faster than market leader Samsung's 005930.KS fifth-generation (5G) phones, chief salesman Richard Yu said.  It was Huawei\u2019s first launch of an all-new smartphone since U.S. President Donald Trump hit the world\u2019s No. 2 player in the market with a U.S. export ban in May.  Washington has effectively barred U.S. firms from supplying Huawei, alleging it is a national security risk as its equipment could be used by Beijing to spy - something the Shenzhen-based company has repeatedly denied.  The result is the Mate 30 lacks access to a licensed version of U.S. Google's GOOGL.O Android operating system, as well as mobile services that include its Play Store and popular apps like Gmail, Youtube or Maps - all victims of the ban.  Huawei pressed ahead with the launch regardless, betting that the Mate 30\u2019s design and hardware would still win fans.  \u201cThis is the best-performing smartphone in the world,\u201d Yu told a news briefing.  \u201cYes, we have some limitations on Google Mobile Services. But we have a huge advantage with the phone itself.\u201d  The Mate 30 Pro\u2019s three-camera array is able to bring images to life in low light. Its on-board video camera has a fine definition of 40 megapixels and, in super-slow motion, a speed of 7,680 frames per second that is several times that of its nearest rival.  The 6.53-inch flex OLED screen wraps further round the body than earlier models, making it possible to fit a display larger than the one on the iPhone 11 Pro Max, onto a smaller device.  The Mate 30 will ship to Europe next month, and will be available in China from next week, said Yu. It will be priced from 799 euros ($884), the top-end Mate 30 Pro from 1,099 euros and the Mate 30 Pro 5G from 1,199 euros.  Huawei also has a luxury Porsche Design model for 2,095 euros.  Slideshow ( 10 images )  Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S10 5G retails at $1,299, and the iPhone 11 Pro starts at $999, but lacks 5G connectivity.  OWN-BRANDED APPS  The build-up to the Huawei launch was overshadowed by uncertainty over whether buyers of the flagship Android device will be able to use apps supported by Google, a unit of Silicon Valley giant Alphabet.  Slideshow ( 10 images )  Instead, the new devices will carry Huawei\u2019s own app gallery, while the company will spend $1 billion to promote the system around it. In another incentive to boost its appeal, Huawei is charging app partners a commission of 15% - half the cut taken by Apple and Google.  Mate 30 users will be able to download Facebook FB.O, WhatsApp and Instagram from other app stores. But it would only be possible to access Youtube, Google's mobile video app, via a web browser, said Yu.  The phones will run on an \u2018open-source\u2019, or generic, version of the Android operating system - like Huawei\u2019s phones in its Chinese home market. That option means that some apps may not work properly or run smoothly, say experts.  Holding the launch in Europe underlines the importance of the 500 million consumers in the region, where Huawei lost five percentage points in market share since the U.S. ban, even as buyers rallied to its brand at home.  Without Google on board, however, analysts say Huawei may struggle to win over consumers.  \u201cEven though this phone is filled with lovely features we don\u2019t think it will sell like past generations,\u201d said Annette Zimmermann of consulting firm Gartner.  \u201cThe average user will not accept that they do not have easy access to their favorite apps,\u201d added Zimmermann, who attended the event.  Huawei says the phone's 'brain' - the Kirin 990 chipset unveiled at a recent tech fair in Berlin - outperforms the Qualcomm-powered QCOM.O 5G rivals already on the market from Samsung.  In particular, the \u2018big core-tiny core\u2019 configuration of the hardware means it can run power-hungry applications like artificial intelligence or support online gaming, while saving battery on routine tasks.  \u201cHuawei has Apple soundly beaten when it comes to form factor design but even these beautiful-looking devices are going to struggle to see any volume without the Google ecosystem,\u201d analyst Richard Windsor said in a note ahead of the launch.","106":"FILE PHOTO: The Apple logo is shown atop an Apple store at a shopping mall in La Jolla, California, U.S., December 17, 2019, 2019.

Caught in the middle of the intensifying trade dispute, the world\u2019s largest contract electronics manufacturer warned in June that the spat between China and the United States was the biggest challenge it was facing.  China is a major production base for Foxconn, while the United States is a key market for the manufacturer.  Shares in Foxconn closed down 6.9 percent on Thursday, versus a 6.3 percent drop in the wider market that came under pressure after Wall Street faced its worst drubbing in eight months overnight.

Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google logos are seen in this combination photo from Reuters files. REUTERS\/File Photos  After dumping shares of Facebook Inc, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc and Alphabet Inc - the FAANG components - prominent hedge fund managers including Tiger Global Management LLC have moved back into the popular group.  Tiger, managed by Chase Coleman, boosted its Facebook stake by 64.5% to 8.8 million class A shares during the first quarter, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It increased its stake in streaming company Netflix by 42.8% to 2.1 million shares. Soros Fund Management LLC opened a new stake in Netflix, holding 50,000 shares, at the end of March.  T. Rowe Price also added Facebook shares during the first quarter, increasing its stake by 19% to 107.9 million shares, as of the end of first quarter.  Netflix shares gained 2.7% to close at $354.99 and Facebook gained 3.1% to close at $186.27.  FAANG\u2019s return to vogue in 2019 has mostly outpaced the broader market\u2019s recovery, with Netflix surging 33% year to date, despite slowing user expansion and the threat of Walt Disney Co\u2019s upcoming video streaming service. Facebook has surged more than 40% in 2019 as investors bet that regulatory threats and calls to break up the world\u2019s largest social network will not endanger its meteoric growth in ad sales.  High-flying FAANG stocks came back to earth late last year amid fears that a decade-old bull market was fading.  \u201cFacebook\u2019s stock price has been hammered on the back of recent controversies, making what was already a very attractive return outlook for the stock even brighter,\u201d Paul Greene, portfolio manager of the T.

Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc said it owned $860.6 million of Amazon shares at the end of March, after the billionaire earlier this month admitted to having underestimated the online retailer and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos.  Buffett, who told CNBC in early May that Berkshire had bought Amazon shares for the first time, detailed the stake in Wednesday\u2019s 13F filing, revealing that Berkshire took a stake in the first quarter totaling 483,300 shares.

Early findings of an Apple audit in the wake of violence at the Wistron plant in India\u2019s Karnataka state showed violations of its \u2018Supplier Code of Conduct\u2019, the Cupertino, California-based tech giant said in a statement.  Contract workers angry over unpaid wages destroyed property, gear and iPhones on Dec. 12, causing millions of dollars in losses to Wistron and forcing it to shut the plant.  Apple said Wistron had failed to implement proper working hour management processes, which \u201cled to payment delays for some workers in October and November\u201d.  Wistron on Saturday admitted some workers at the plant in Karnataka\u2019s Narasapura had not been paid properly or on time, and it was removing a top executive overseeing its India business.  Apple said it will continue to monitor Wistron\u2019s progress on corrective action.  \u201cOur main objective is to make sure all the workers are treated with dignity and respect, and fully compensated promptly,\u201d Apple said, adding that it continued to investigate issues at the plant, which is located some 50 km outside of the southern tech hub of Bengaluru and assembles one iPhone model.  \u201cThis is a new facility and we recognise that we made mistakes as we expanded,\u201d Wistron said in a statement. \u201cSome of the processes we put in place to manage labor agencies and payments need to be strengthened and upgraded.\u201d  Wistron said it is re-structuring its teams and setting up 24-hour hotlines for employees to make anonymous complaints.

Wistron had plans to make another iPhone model at the Narasapura plant and was planning to hire up to 20,000 workers in a year\u2019s time, a source told Reuters previously.  But it could not cope with the rapid scaling up of manpower and breached several laws, Karnataka state officials found after an inspection of the plant following the violence.  The number of workers rose to 10,500 from the permitted 5,000 in a short span of time, the Karnataka factories department said in a report, which was reviewed by Reuters.  \u201cThe HR department has not been adequately set up with personnel of sound knowledge of labour laws,\u201d the report of the inspection, which was conducted on Dec. 13, concluded.  Wistron did respond to emails from Reuters seeking comment on the violations listed.  Other violations highlighted in the report included underpayment of wages to contract workers and housekeeping staff, and making female staff work overtime without legal authorisation.  The findings of this inspection, and another preliminary government audit, confirm the grievances over unpaid wages and poor attendance recording systems recounted in interviews to Reuters by at least half a dozen Wistron workers.  The Wistron probation will likely also dent Apple\u2019s plans to scale up in India, a market it has bet on to expand its manufacturing base beyond China.  Apple began the assembly of its first iPhone model in India via Wistron in 2017. It has now ramped up assembly operations, with Foxconn in southern India and another top supplier Pegatron is set to begin local operations.

Apple beat sales estimates in part by selling fewer but pricier iPhones than analysts expected. The company sold 41.3 million units, below expectations of 41.8 million units.  Apple posted third-quarter revenue of $53.3 billion and profits of $2.34 per share, compared with analyst estimates of $52.3 billion and $2.18 per share, respectively, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Services revenue was $9.5 billion, beating analyst expectations of $9.1 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S. The revenue included $236 million from resolving lawsuits such as Apple\u2019s long-running dispute with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.  The average iPhone selling price hit $724, beating analyst expectations of $694, according to data from FactSet. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters that the high selling prices were driven by sales of the company\u2019s costlier recent models, including the $999 iPhone X. Maestri said the iPhone X was the quarter\u2019s most popular model.  The world\u2019s most valuable technology company also forecast revenue of $60 billion to $62 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter, which will include early sales of soon-to-be-announced phone models, beating the $59.6 billion analysts expected, according to data from Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  As smartphone buying has plateaued, Apple has extended its iPhone line with both pricier and cheaper versions, from the iPhone X to the lowest priced $349 iPhone SE. It has also soothed investor concerns with a $100 billion stock buyback program and promises of growth from services such as streaming music and video, where Apple faces competition from rivals including Spotify Technology SA and Netflix Inc .  But several of Apple\u2019s services do not face strong rivals. Maestri told Reuters that sales from Apple Care, the company\u2019s warranty offering, were up 27 percent versus a year ago, though the company did not disclose a dollar figure for sales.  Apple was largely spared in last week\u2019s tech sector sell-off when shares of Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc and Netflix fell sharply on concerns about their future growth. With a market capitalization of $938.7 billion at market close on Monday, Apple is tickling at the title of world\u2019s first trillion-dollar company.  Apple\u2019s biggest selling products do not yet face duties stemming from the U.S.-China trade disputes, but President Donald Trump has threatened hundreds of billions of further tariffs whose product categories have not yet been enumerated.  But one of the categories potentially affected by tariffs is the Apple Watch, which is one of Apple\u2019s growth drivers. Maestri told Reuters that the company\u2019s so-called \u201cwearables\u201d business - which includes the Apple Watch and its AirPods headphones, among other items - has generated $10 billion in sales in the past 10 quarters and saw sales increase 60 percent in the most recent quarter. \u201cWe are not able to catch up to demand yet and continue to add capacity for the AirPods,\u201d Maestri said.  Apple\u2019s margins are facing pressure as it moves to put pricier components, such as OLED displays that show more vivid colors, into its products.

MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.1 percent at 1208 GMT after rising to its highest since early October. May Day holidays across Asia and Europe meant trading was thinner than usual.  CME E-Mini S&P 500 Futures were at record highs and Nasdaq futures were up 0.7 percent, suggesting Wall Street is poised for more gains after hitting another record close overnight fuelled by optimism about first quarter earnings.  Apple shares jumped 5.8 percent in premarket trading after the iPhone maker beat low-balled expectations despite a record drop in phone revenue, gave an upbeat assessment of its China business, said it would buy back $75 billion in shares and hiked its dividend.  That blast of good news soothed worries about a prolonged weakness in global results, with analysts becoming more upbeat about corporate health on Wall Street.  Weaker oil prices knocked London\u2019s blue chips into negative territory in late morning although, in a sign of broader appetite for riskier assets, Australian shares ended just shy of an 11-year peak.  There was plenty to keep those investors who were at their desks occupied though: Beijing and Washington resumed talks aimed at ending a bitter trade war and Fed chairman Jerome Powell was due to speak later following the central bank\u2019s two-day policy meeting.  The dollar was down 0.1 percent against a basket of six major currencies, trading in a tight range after hitting a one-week low as investors bet the central bank will stick to its dovish stance even after a rash of better data.  The central bank is largely expected to leave U.S. borrowing costs unchanged as it seeks to balance solid economic growth against low inflation.  \u201cThis is the first chance to test-drive this idea that the Fed is looking at things differently to last year,\u201d said James McCormick, global head of desk strategy at NatWest Markets.  \u201cWe expect the Fed today to recognise growth data is better, but the emphasis will be on the low inflation.\u201d  An unorthodox call from U.S. President Donald Trump for a cut in interest rates will likely go unheeded, but is likely to increase focus on Powell at his press conference.  CAUTION FOR MAY  Sentiment has improved along with global economic data - most recently from the euro zone where data on Tuesday showed first quarter growth topped expectations - but inflation numbers remain soft.  There was also some caution ahead of the summer lull with investors questioning how much longer the rally across global equities can last with better economic data and a stabilisation in earnings priced in.  \u201cHistorically the more difficult half of the year starts today,\u201d said Ian Williams, economics and strategy research analyst at Peel Hunt. \u201cThe next six months will present plenty of geopolitical challenges.\u201d  Commodities were mixed with base metals prices rising on hopes of a breakthrough in the U.S.-China talks, while crude oil prices eased as data showed a rise in U.S. inventories.  Brent crude oil futures were at $71.83 per barrel, down 0.3 percent, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 0.8 percent at $63.37 per barrel.","119":"FILE PHOTO: Volkswagen logos are pictured during the media day of the Salao do Automovel International Auto Show in Sao Paulo, Brazil November 6, 2018.

They gained another 7 percent following the strategy update, extending their rally on the back of Wednesday\u2019s forecast-beating third-quarter results.  Bagherli was due to hold a strategy briefing with analysts in London on Thursday and ahead of the event the company provided its first guidance on its outlook for 2019. The Apple deal will not have any impact on the current year.  With the proceeds from the deal adding to the $617 million already on hand, Bagherli said Dialog would seek to grow through mergers and acquisitions.  He said that Dialog was looking at several potential targets to supplement its existing strengths, but would exercise financial discipline. \u201cWe are not looking at acquisitions that require massive leverage,\u201d he told Reuters.  Around half of the proceeds of the Apple deal would go towards running the business, leaving the remainder, plus cash on hand, free for takeovers or share buybacks.

The company expects underlying gross margins of between 47 and 48 percent, a fraction below its third-quarter performance of 48.6 percent.  It sees its underlying operating margin at between 18 and 23 percent, compared to a third-quarter outturn of 21.8 percent.  Dialog, which has no chip production assets of its own, is more tied to the fortunes of Apple than it is to the broader semiconductor industry cycle, where Korean electronics giant Samsung Electronics has warned that a two-year boom in memory chips could be ending.  It wants to shake off that image by deploying its expertise in so-called mixed-signal integrated circuits - which can handle both analogue and digital signals - to capture new market opportunities.  Dialog claims market leadership in rapid-charging and configurable chips that are used, for example, to power up smartphones. It is number two in Bluetooth low-energy products that connect wearable devices like fitness trackers.  Bagherli said he saw new opportunities in the Internet of Things that comprises connected \u2018smart\u2019 devices, such as Bluetooth-enabled styluses for tablets or for tyre-pressure monitors.  Dialog is also talking to pharmaceutical companies about designing chips for devices such as insulin pumps and glucose meters, part of an e-healthcare trend where patients can self-medicate while their condition is monitored remotely.  Another new product area Dialog hopes to move into is gaming consoles, whose power-management demands are similar to those of smartphones or tablets, Bagherli said.","121":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - As Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc worked toward a high-profile distribution deal at least a couple of years ago, one proposal on the table was for Apple to have \u201ccompeting ads removed from search\u201d results on Amazon, according to documents released on Wednesday from a U.S. House of Representatives investigation.  The document, which is not dated but shows Apple products released in late 2017, offers rare insight into how two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies considered using their size for special treatment from one another.  For years, Amazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer, carried only a limited set of Apple products. Users often found used Apple products, and in some cases, knockoffs.  That changed in 2018 when the two announced a deal for Apple and some approved resellers to market iPhones to Amazon customers in several countries in exchange for a promise from Amazon to rid its site of Apple products from third-party merchants not authorized by Apple.  Investigators for the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust panel asked for documents related to the deal, turning up a slide presentation marked \u201cApple Confidential\u201d that appeared to discuss principles and proposed terms.  Among them was that Amazon would have a \u201cDifferentiated Apple Customer Experience\u201d that would include \u201ccompeting ads removed from search,\u201d product detail pages and checkout pages, according to the document. It proposed that ad treatment would be the same \u201cas for Amazon products.\u201d  Another was that Amazon\u2019s \u201cBuy Box\u201d would be turned off \u201cfor limited Apple-agreed situations.\u201d The Buy Box is Amazon\u2019s automated recommendation for which merchant out of several selling the same item should get the sale and whose non-public algorithms bear heavily on the success of independent sellers.  It was unclear if the proposals were ultimately discussed or part of the final agreement.  Amazon and Apple did not immediately comment.","122":"(The story has been refiled to correct spelling of Microsoft HoloLens in final paragraph.)  The Apple logo is seen on a computer screen in this illustration photo taken in Bordeaux, France, February 1, 2017. REUTERS\/Regis Duvignau\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Apple Inc has acquired a startup focused on making lenses for augmented reality glasses, the company confirmed on Wednesday, a signal Apple has ambitions to make a wearable device that would superimpose digital information on the real world.  Apple confirmed it acquired Longmont, Colorado-based Akonia Holographics. \u201cApple buys smaller companies from time to time, and we generally don\u2019t discuss our purpose or plans,\u201d the iPhone maker said in a statement.  Akonia could not immediately be reached for comment. The company was founded in 2012 by a group of holography scientists and had originally focused on holographic data storage before shifting its efforts to creating displays for augmented reality glasses, according to its website.  In augmented reality, digital information is overlaid on the real world as in the popular game Pokemon Go. Mobile phones use their camera system to do this on the phone\u2019s screen, but major technology firms are racing to create glasses that will show digital information on transparent lenses.  Akonia said its display technology allows for \u201cthin, transparent smart glass lenses that display vibrant, full-color, wide field-of-view images.\u201d The firm has a portfolio of more than 200 patents related to holographic systems and materials, according to its website.  Akonia also said it raised $11.6 million in seed funding in 2012 and was seeking additional funding. It was unclear whether that funding ever materialized or who the firm\u2019s investors were.  The purchase price and date of the acquisition could not be learned, though one executive in the augmented reality industry said the Akonia team had become \u201cvery quiet\u201d over the past six months, implying that the deal may have happened in the first half of 2018.  Apple has a history of buying smaller companies whose technologies show up years later in its products. In 2013, Apple acquired a small Israeli firm called PrimeSense that made three-dimensional sensors. The iPhone X, launched last year, used a similar sensor to power facial recognition features.  Bloomberg last year reported that Apple was developing augmented reality glasses that could ship as early as 2020. Apple declined to comment on its plans or products.  But the company last year launched augmented reality applications for its iPhones and iPads, and CEO Tim Cook has called augmented reality a \u201cbig and profound\u201d technology development.  \u201cThis is one of those huge things that we\u2019ll look back at and marvel on the start of it,\u201d Cook said of augmented reality on a conference call with investors last year.  The Akonia acquisition is the first clear indication of how Apple might handle one of the most daunting challenges in augmented reality hardware: Producing crystal clear optical displays thin and light enough to fit into glasses similar to everyday frames with images bright enough for outdoor use and suited to mass manufacturing at a relatively low price.  Augmented reality headsets currently on the market such as Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O HoloLens and startup Magic Leap's Magic Leap One both use darkened lenses and are intended for indoor use. Both are also intended for software developers testing the technology and cost several thousand dollars.","123":"July 9 (Reuters) - Four senior U.S. House Republicans sent letters on Monday to the chief executives of Apple Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc asking questions about location data and mobile phone privacy practices and the handling of customer data.

The report topped Wall Street expectations, with even long-overshadowed categories like iPads and Macs getting a boost. Shares rose as much as 6% in extended trading after the results.  The fiscal third-quarter results, which included iPhone sales some $4 billion above analyst expectations, came on the same day that U.S. gross domestic product collapsed at a 32.9% annualized rate last quarter, the nation\u2019s worst economic performance since the Great Depression.  Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri also confirmed supply chain rumblings that the new lineup of iPhones, usually released in late September, would face delays of a few weeks.  But executives predicted continued strong performance from the company\u2019s products.  Other major tech companies Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Facebook Inc FB.O also posted results that topped Wall Street targets, sending their shares up.  With 60% of sales coming from international markets, the Cupertino, California-based company posted iPhone revenues of $26.42 billion, $4 billion above analyst expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  In an interview with Reuters, CEO Tim Cook said that after disruptions in April, sales began to pick back up in May and June, helped by what he called a \u201cstrong\u201d launch for the $399 iPhone SE introduced in April.  \u201cI think the economic stimulus that was in place - and I\u2019m not just focused on the U.S., but more broadly - was a help,\u201d Cook told Reuters.  The continued growth in services and accessories also showed the durability of the company\u2019s brand, which has prompted investors to view it as a comparative safe haven and pushed up share prices since March.  GRAPHIC: Apple posts a surprise rise in revenue - here  The company saw strong sales in its greater China region, where aggressive pricing during a June holiday shopping season and lower-priced iPhone SE model released in April helped boost sales 2% to $9.33 billion.  \u201cChina remains a key ingredient in Apple\u2019s recipe for success as we estimate roughly 20% of iPhone upgrades will be coming from this region over the coming year,\u201d Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities said in a note.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Apple also announced a 4-for-1 stock split, saying it wanted to keep shares accessible to a broad range of investors. Shares soared past $400 for the first time Thursday, though they had been proportionally higher before a 7-for-1 split in 2014.  Apple\u2019s fiscal third-quarter revenue and profits were $59.69 billion and $2.58 per share, compared with analyst expectations of $52.25 billion and $2.04 per share.  Sales in its services segment, which also includes offerings such as iCloud and Apple Music, rose 14.8% to $13.16 billion, compared with and analyst expectations of $13.18 billion. Cook told Reuters that Apple has 550 million paying subscribers on its platform, up from 515 in the previous quarter.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Sales in the wearables segment that includes the Apple Watch rose 16.7% to $6.45 billion, compared with estimates of $6.0 billion.  Apple did not give a fiscal fourth-quarter forecast.  Apple benefited from remote work and learning trends, reporting sales in its iPad and Mac segments of $6.58 billion and $7.08 billion, which beat expectations of $4.88 billion and $6.06 billion.  \u201cBoth had some really significant product announcements at the end of March, beginning of April,\u201d Cook told Reuters. \u201cYou combine that with the work from home and remote learning, and it\u2019s yielded really, really strong results.\u201d  But the global smartphone market was already stagnating before the novel coronavirus caused it to contract, and Apple has leaned heavily into growing its services business, which is where the company\u2019s fastest revenue growth occurred during the fiscal third quarter. The biggest component of that business is the App Store, where Apple generates commissions between 15% and 30% on some sales.  On Wednesday, Cook faced questions from U.S. lawmakers about Apple\u2019s practices related to the store, which have come under fire from independent app developers who say its rules and unpredictable approval process put them at a disadvantage against the iPhone maker.","128":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Taiwan\u2019s Wistron Corp plans to assemble printed circuit boards (PCBs) for iPhones at its new plant in southern India, two sources said, highlighting Apple Inc\u2019s push to expand manufacturing in the world\u2019s second-biggest smartphone market.  FILE PHOTO: A salesman uses his iPhone at a mobile phone store in New Delhi, India, July 27, 2016. REUTERS\/Adnan Abidi\/File Photo  The local assembly of PCBs by Wistron\u2019s India unit will be a first for the contract manufacturer, which began making Apple\u2019s low-priced SE model in the southern tech hub of Bengaluru in 2017. It currently assembles the 6S and 7 iPhone models there as well.  A PCB is a bed for key components such as processors, memory and wireless chip sets that are the heart of an electronic device. Once assembled, or populated with components, PCBs account for about half the cost of a smartphone.  Wistron\u2019s second iPhone plant, some 65 km (40 miles) from Bengaluru, is expected to become operational by April, the sources said, adding that it will make iPhone 7 and 8 models, some of which will be exported.  The facility will be capable of producing up to 8 million smartphones annually, they said.  The plan is part of Wistron\u2019s 30 billion rupee ($422.12 million) investment proposal submitted to the Karnataka state government in 2018.  Wistron\u2019s bigger rival Foxconn, which began making iPhone XR models in India last year, already assembles PCBs for those devices locally.  The deepening of PCB assembly in India will help Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple save on import taxes on smartphone components, levied by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government to boost local manufacturing and create new jobs.  On Saturday, India said in its federal budget that it will from April begin taxing imports of populated PCBs at a higher 20%, from the previous rate of 10%.  Apple declined to comment. Wistron did not respond to a request for comment.  Apple, which still makes most of its iPhones in China, has gradually moved to expand production in other countries as Washington and Beijing wage a disruptive battle over trade and technology.  In India, a market with 1.1 billion wireless connections and about 480 million smartphones, Apple\u2019s premium devices have proven too costly for many consumers. The company\u2019s market share by shipment volumes is just over 1%, though it was among the fastest growing smartphone brands in India in the quarter to Dec. 2019, according to market researcher Counterpoint.  India remains largely dependent on China for supplies of smartphone parts such as cells, display panels, camera modules and printed circuit boards.  The coronavirus outbreak in China could cause a delay in Wistron and Apple\u2019s plans for India, one of the sources said.  The epidemic, which has killed more than 250 so far, threatens to disrupt India\u2019s production of smartphones if it continues to spread, Reuters reported previously.","129":"FILE PHOTO: A man looks at the screen of his mobile phone in front of an Apple logo outside its store in Shanghai, China on July 30, 2017.

REUTERS\/Rick Wilking\/File Photo  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N on Tuesday said it has more than doubled its investment in generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd TEVA.TA, and confirmed it has become Apple Inc's AAPL.O second-largest shareholder.  Berkshire also shed an investment dating to the mid-1970s that reflected Buffett's longstanding love for newspapers, selling its stake in Graham Holdings Co GHC.N, the former publisher of the Washington Post.  The changes were disclosed in a regulatory filing detailing Berkshire\u2019s U.S.-listed stock holdings as of March 31.  Berkshire owned about $173 billion of equities, as well as dozens of businesses in the railroad, insurance, energy, chemical, food and retail and other sectors.  Berkshire said it owned about 40.5 million Teva American depositary receipts (ADRs) worth about $693 million as of that date, up from 18.9 million ADRs three months earlier.  Teva\u2019s share price rose 5.1 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday. Stocks often rise in price when Berkshire reveals new or increased stakes.  Larger stock investments are normally made by Buffett, while smaller bets come from his investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. The filing does not say who bought which stocks.  Berkshire said much of the $14.8 billion it invested in equities during the quarter went to Apple, and said it owned 239.6 million shares worth more than $40 billion.  That gave Berkshire a roughly 5 percent stake in the iPhone maker, trailing only Vanguard Group and BlackRock.  Buffett told CNBC on May 7: \u201cI\u2019d love to own 100 percent\u201d of Apple, two days after he told Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting that he might buy more Apple for the right price.  Berkshire shed a more than six-year-old investment in International Business Machines Corp IBM.N that Buffett has admitted was not his best.  The sale of Berkshire\u2019s last 107,775 Graham shares ended an investment that once exceeded $1 billion.  Buffett pitched newspapers while growing up in Omaha, Nebraska, and was a longtime friend of the late Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham.  She died in 2001 and the Post was sold 12 years later to Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O founder Jeff Bezos. In 2014, Buffett swapped much of Berkshire's stake in Graham for Berkshire stock that Graham owned, a TV station in Miami and cash.  Berkshire still invests in newspapers and recently owned 32 daily newspapers including its hometown Omaha World-Herald.  Buffett has lamented how changing reader habits have damaged the industry, and said only The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and perhaps the Post have come up with digital business models capable of replacing lost print advertising.  In Tuesday's filing, Berkshire also reported higher stakes in Bank of New York Mellon Co BK.N, Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N, Monsanto Co MON.N and US Bancorp USB.N, and lower stakes in Charter Communications Inc CHTR.O, Liberty Global Plc LBTYA.O, Phillips 66 PSX.N, United Continental Holdings Inc UAL.N, Verisk Analytics Inc VRSK.O and Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N.

Apple made the tweaks in July, the Times reported. The newspaper performed an analysis of six years of search results that showed that Apple\u2019s own apps ranked first for at least 700 search terms in the store since 2016. The newspaper said its analysis included rankings of more than 1,800 specific apps across 13 keywords since 2013.  After the software change in July, fewer of Apple\u2019s own apps appeared at the top of search results, executives told the newspaper. The Wall Street Journal also published an examination of Apple\u2019s App Store rankings that month, with similar findings that Apple\u2019s own apps often ranked highly for generic search terms.  Apple told the Times that its apps crowded the top search listings because the company\u2019s algorithm was designed deliver multiple apps from the developer that the user had expressed interest in.  For example, searches for the game Angry Birds might bring up other titles by the game\u2019s maker, Rovio Entertainment. Searches for common terms such as \u201cmusic\u201d or \u201cpodcast\u201d would return Apple Music or Apple Podcasts, along with unrelated Apple apps, forcing Apple\u2019s competitors further down the listings.

FILE PHOTO: A sign on the Qualcomm campus is seen in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The accusation, made in a legal filing on Tuesday, is the latest salvo in a drawn-out patent dispute between the two tech heavyweights.  Qualcomm accused Apple of misusing secret Qualcomm software to share information about its chips with Intel engineers in a November lawsuit, but went further on Tuesday by saying Apple stole Qualcomm trade secrets as part of a \u201cmulti-year campaign of sloppy, inappropriate and deceitful conduct\u201d designed to improve rivals\u2019 chipsets and ultimately divert Qualcomm\u2019s Apple-based business to Intel.  Apple declined to comment. Intel, which is not named as a defendant in Qualcomm\u2019s lawsuit, declined to comment.  The world\u2019s most valuable technology company previously used Qualcomm\u2019s modem chips in its iPhone, which helped the device connect to wireless data networks. With the iPhone 7, launched in 2016, Apple began using Intel modem chips in some models instead.  Qualcomm told investors in July it believed its modem chips were completely removed from the newest generation of iPhones released this month, leaving Intel as the sole supplier. Teardowns of the new devices have confirmed that Intel is supplying the modem chips.  Apple has cast doubt on Qualcomm\u2019s claims. Last month, it alleged that Qualcomm refused to answer its questions about which specific confidential information it had improperly shared with Intel. Apple has also alleged that it gave Qualcomm the chance to verify that Qualcomm\u2019s software had been used properly.  The dispute, taking place in San Diego County Superior Court, is one strand of a wide-ranging legal battle in which Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices. Qualcomm, the world\u2019s largest mobile phone chipmaker, has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement.  Qualcomm asked Judge Jacqueline Stern on Tuesday to allow it to attach the new allegations to its existing complaint rather than force it to file a new lawsuit.  DISCOVERY PHASE  Qualcomm has previously said it gave Apple access to its confidential software tools to help Apple integrate its modem chips into the iPhone.  On Tuesday, Qualcomm alleged that, since filing its lawsuit in November, it has discovered that Apple repeatedly used Qualcomm software to help Intel\u2019s engineers \u201cimprove the sub-par performance of Intel\u2019s chipsets.\u201d  It did not present evidence or say how it found that out. The case is currently in the discovery phase, where parties can exchange evidence.  Qualcomm\u2019s modems rely on a combination of chips and software to allow phones to receive wireless data. Qualcomm gave Apple access its source code and software development tools so Apple could modify Qualcomm\u2019s software for use in the iPhone, on the condition that Apple did not use the code or tools to help another chipmaker.  In Tuesday\u2019s filing, Qualcomm alleged that Apple used the tools to open so-called \u201clog files\u201d from Qualcomm and then gave those files to Intel engineers. Log files contain rows of data generated by computer hardware or software, and engineers often analyze them to pinpoint technical problems and optimize the performance of a chip.  \u201cIntel engineers even complained to Apple engineers about being unable to open Qualcomm log files, which Apple had provided to Intel, for lack of the appropriate Qualcomm tools,\u201d Qualcomm said in its filing.  \u201cIn response, Apple engineers routinely used Qualcomm tools to create post-processed log files, which they sent to Intel engineers to use in improving Intel\u2019s chipset solutions,\u201d it added.  Qualcomm did not specify in its filing what within those log files, or within the other information Apple allegedly gave to Intel, constituted trade secrets. But it said the information helped Intel.  \u201cIt apparently improved Intel chipsets to the point where Apple decided to divert some of Qualcomm\u2019s Apple-based business to Intel,\u201d Qualcomm said in its filing.","143":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  LONDON (Reuters) - Apple and Google said they were continuing to talk to the British government about the technology used in its smartphone COVID-19 contact tracing app as the two companies released the initial version of their own system.

Apple shares rose 5.7 percent after the bell as the iPhone maker reported sharp growth in its services business.  Investors were relieved that there was no fresh bad news after the company shocked financial markets at the start of this month when its rare revenue warning sparked fears the U.S.-China trade tensions are taking a toll on the once high-flying tech sector.  CEO Tim Cook, who is in regular contact with U.S. President Donald Trump, also said trade tension between the United States and China is easing in January.

The plant would strengthen the company\u2019s position as the primary screen supplier for Apple Inc as sales of the iPhone 6 soared. And the U.S. smartphone juggernaut said it would front most of the $1.5 billion in costs, with Japan Display paying it back with a percentage of screen sales, according to two company sources.  Four years later, Apple\u2019s shifting fortunes have brought Japan Display to its knees and threaten to end Japan\u2019s long run as a leader in display technology.  A slowdown in iPhone sales, combined with a proliferation of new iPhone models - many of which use newer organic light-emitting displays (OLED) - have left Japan Display\u2019s new factory running at half capacity.  But it still owes Apple a majority of the construction cost, one of the company sources said. He declined to give the exact amount.  Desperate for capital, Japan Display is looking to an investor group, led by China Silkroad Investment Capital, for a bailout, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. The deal would give the Chinese group a near-majority stake in exchange for an investment of $500 million to $700 million, the sources said.  The group plans to build an OLED panel plant in China using Japan Display\u2019s technology, according to those two sources.  The company\u2019s woes show how weak iPhone sales and a broader slowdown in the smartphone business are causing pain across the Asian electronics supply chain.  \u201cIn retrospect, the new plant was unnecessary,\u201d one of the sources with direct knowledge of the bailout talks said. \u201cBut the decision wasn\u2019t wrong back then. Japan Display started to pick up steam thanks to Apple at the time, and Apple wanted the new plant.\u201d  Japan Display wasn\u2019t alone in betting on robust growth in iPhone sales, which looked especially attractive because of Apple\u2019s now-abandoned strategy of offering few variations in each product cycle.  \u201cWe were all thrilled to see lifetime sales of a single iPhone model reaching 100 million units,\u201d a source at another Apple parts supplier said.  \u201cSupplying components for just one model in massive volume is extremely cost-efficient,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, we exposed ourselves to huge volatility risks.\u201d  Japan Display has built relationships with other smartphone vendors, including Chinese powerhouses Huawei, Xiaomi , and OPPO.  But it is losing their orders too as sales growth softens and the Chinese players switch to domestic panel makers such as BOE Technology and Tianma Microelectronics, which have sharply improved the quality of their screens.  Japan Display supplied almost a third of Huawei\u2019s smartphone screens in 2015, but its share had plunged to 4 percent by the third quarter last year as the Chinese company turned to BOE and Tianma, according to researcher IHS Markit.  Sources at Japan Display and other Apple suppliers interviewed for the story declined to be identified as they are not authorised to talk to the media. Suppliers rarely speak about business with Apple on the record because of strict non-disclosure agreements.  NON-APPLE BUSINESSES  Japan Display was formed in 2012 in a government-backed merger of the ailing display units of Sony Corp, Toshiba Corp and Hitachi Ltd.  It boasts strength in so-called thin-film transistor technology (TFT), crucial for making high-resolution images on both LCD and OLED panels. In addition to its Apple business, which accounted for more than half the company\u2019s revenue over the last four years, it\u2019s a top supplier of dashboard panels for major automotive component companies such as Continental .  But Japan Display has struggled to navigate the fast-changing display business.  Its new LCD factory was still under construction when Apple informed Japan Display in autumn 2015 that it planned to move quickly away from LCD to the newer OLED technology, two former company officials said. It was too costly by then to abandon the half-completed plant, one of them said.  Japan Display\u2019s management at the time, led by former Sanyo Electric executive Mitsuru Homma, promised to start mass-production of OLED panels by 2018.  In the meantime, the management shut down older, unprofitable LCD lines to shift resources to OLED, but its main investor, a state-backed fund, blocked plans for drastic job cuts for fear of public backlash, one of the former officials said.  Unexpectedly weak sales of the iPhone 6s created a cash crunch in 2016, and Homma resigned early the next year after the company took a $640 million bailout from the state-backed fund.  The new chief executive, Nobuhiro Higashiiriki, declared a full-on shift to OLED. But the company was already behind rivals, notably Samsung Electronics, and still needed more cash for OLED investment. Disappointing sales of the iPhone XR, the only LCD model in Apple\u2019s 2018 lineup, were yet another blow.  \u201cThe company now looks exhausted, with many engineers leaving,\u201d one former employee said.  Some board members have expressed concerns about technology transfer that may follow the proposed Chinese investment, sources familiar with the talks said. But the government investment fund has run out of patience.  \u201cWe don\u2019t have any other option,\u201d one of the company sources said, adding that the government has been quiet about the bailout plan. \u201cThey could argue that display technologies are not something Japan must keep and protect, when Chinese panel makers are ramping up more display plants.\u201d  ($1 = 111.0200 yen)","146":"SAN FRANCISCO Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are locked in a tight race to become the second publicly-listed U.S. company to reach a $1 trillion stock market value after Apple became the first to touch the 13-digit milestone.

To be sure, past stock gains are not a reliable predictor of future performance, and the surge in Amazon shares in recent years has been exceptional by most standards.

The Cupertino, California-based tech giant blamed fewer iPhone upgrades and slowing sales in China for the rare revenue warning, its first since 2007. Its shares tumbled 8 percent in after-hours trade.  The news also sparked a \u2018flash crash\u2019 in holiday-thinned currency markets as investors rushed to less risky assets, with the Japanese yen soaring against most major currencies in a matter of seconds.  MSCI\u2019s broadest gauge of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.2 percent early in the Asian day and losses were expected to mount when trading opened in more tech-heavy markets in the region.  A jump in Australian shares, which rose 1.3 percent, helped to offset weakness elsewhere in the region after its currency fell to near decade lows, boosting exporters.  Overnight, shares on Wall Street slid in early trade on growth worries but later clawed back losses, with a surge in oil prices driving gains in energy shares.

KGI Securities said in a report on Monday that while some of TSMC\u2019s 12-inch wafer shipments will be delayed, the impact to the upcoming iPhone launch is limited because \u201cthe upstream supply chain usually prepares for these incidents and manufactures surplus chipsets during the initial ramp-up stage\u201d.

As of 0124 GMT, TSMC shares were down 1 percent at T$245.0, compared with a 0.02 percent fall for the benchmark index.  Major tech companies in Taiwan, a crucial part of the global electronics supply chain, usually enter a busier period in the second half of the year ahead of tech gadget launches.

The announcement in a Wednesday blog post by the Alphabet Inc unit comes shortly before Apple is expected to start enforcing new tracking transparency rules.  Apple for years has supplied apps with a unique identifier, known as IDFA, to help them link the same user across multiple programs. The code can be essential in determining to whom to show an ad and tracking whether it prompted them to make a purchase.  But Apple has said \u201cearly\u201d this year it will require that apps show users a one-time pop-up message to gain their consent to access their IDFA.  Facebook Inc and other app makers are concerned the warning may discourage users from opting in and cripple ad sales.  As users of Google\u2019s apps are typically logged in, it has a tracking alternative to IDFA and as such its core ad business would likely not be affected by Apple\u2019s changes.  But it warned in its blog post that publishers and advertisers that rely on its mobile ad software will experience weaker results without IDFA access.  Though Google is developing alternatives for clients, they may not be immediately ready, it said.  Google added that clients can use its software regardless of whether they show the pop-up and obtain the necessary consent, and it is not making any recommendations on what they should do.

In the ongoing probe since at least October 2018, investigators have asked Apple for data about \u201cunexpected shutdowns\u201d of iPhones and the company\u2019s throttling, or slowing down, of the devices through power management software, documents Reuters obtained from Texas through a public records request showed.  Last week, a separate document obtained from Texas by a tech watchdog group showed that Texas\u2019 attorney general was involved in the investigation but did not specify the issues being investigated nor which state was leading the effort.  A majority of U.S. states, representing both Democratic and Republican attorneys general, are teaming up on the investigation, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.  The attorneys general offices in Arizona and Texas declined to comment. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.  Apple came under fire in 2017 when Primate Labs, the maker of software for measuring a phone\u2019s processor speeds, revealed that some iPhones became slower as they aged.  Apple later acknowledged that it reduced power demands - which can slow the processor - when an aging phone\u2019s battery struggles to supply the peak current the processor demands. Apple said without its adjustments, iPhones would have unexpectedly shut down from power spikes.  Outraged iPhone users said that appeared to confirm long-held suspicions that Apple slowed older devices to encourage users to buy new phones. Apple publicly apologized and slashed prices on battery replacements.  Earlier this year, Apple agreed to pay up to $500 million to settle a proposed class-action lawsuit related to the battery issues.","158":"April 17 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc\u2019s surprise settlement of a prolonged legal fight with Apple Inc paves the way for the chipmaker to resolve a similar dispute with China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, ahead of the launch of 5G phones, several analysts said.  Shares of Qualcomm, which closed up 23 percent on Tuesday, rose another 10 percent in premarket trade on Wednesday after it signed a six-year patent license deal with Apple.  If Wednesday\u2019s gains hold, Qualcomm would tack on more than $20 billion in market value since announcing the settlement.  The two companies had been at odds over patents and royalties over modems. While Qualcomm did not close the terms of the deal, analysts estimated that Apple withheld $5 billion, or about $2 per share, under its previous royalty payment agreement.  Qualcomm and Huawei are also fighting over the same issues.  Huawei stopped royalty payments in April 2017 and Qualcomm said in January it has signed an interim agreement with the Chinese company and is in talks for a final resolution.  \u201cWe now expect an imminent settlement with Huawei which has also been withholding royalty payments, which we estimate will add another $0.50-$0.75 of EPS,\u201d Cowen and Company analysts said.  Three brokerages raised their ratings on Qualcomm\u2019s stock and at least eight brokerages boosted their price targets. Fourteen out of 25 brokerages rated the stock \u201cbuy\u201d or higher and the rest \u201chold\u201d, according to Refinitiv data.  A settlement with Apple and Huawei will not only bring in more royalty payments and reduce legal costs, it will help Qualcomm to focus more in rolling out its 5G modems, several analysts said.  The Qualcomm settlement means Apple will rely on the chipmaker for most if not all of its 5G modems in iPhones starting in 2020, with Qualcomm likely the leading to only supplier for the next several years, Canaccord Genuity analysts said.

CEO Tim Cook presents the new iPhone 11 Pro at an Apple event at their headquarters in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 10, 2019. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  It faces an uphill battle when it launches its Apple TV+ streaming service on Nov. 1 for $5 a month against rivals with deeper libraries and years of experience making hit shows.  To quickly build a subscriber base, Apple is offering a year of free service for customers who purchase most Apple devices. Several Wall Street analysts said on Monday that the company could sell as many as 200 million of its latest iPhones to existing users upgrading their old phones.  Apple TV+ - which at launch will include eight original shows, including \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d featuring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon and \u201cSee,\u201d a sci-fi drama featuring Jason Momoa - will be available in over 100 markets at launch.  The big question is whether those customers will stick around after the free trial ends.  Ahead of the announcement, analysts and investors viewed Apple, which is late to the streaming war, as facing a tough fight competing with Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Walt Disney Co's DIS.N Disney+. Apple is also trying to win out over HBO Max with its hit shows like \"Game of Thrones,\" \"Friends\" and \"The Sopranos.\"  Apple's offerings are dwarfed by the extensive catalog of industry leader Netflix Inc NFLX.O, which has a reported $10 billion budget for content and 151 million paid subscribers. tmsnrt.rs\/2N6OB2j  Walt Disney Co's DIS.N Disney+ - launching Nov. 12 - has helped lift the stock almost 20% in recent months. Disney, which already controls the fast-growing streaming service Hulu, boasts a deep library of Marvel's superhero hits, the Star Wars universe, \"Toy Story\" creator Pixar animation and the National Geographic channel.  Disney+ has a budget of over $1 billion for original content - a figure that will grow to around $2 billion by 2024. It is priced higher than Apple TV+, at $7 monthly or $70 annually. A bundle that includes ESPN+ and Hulu will cost $13 per month.  Media executives and analysts believe that most households are willing to pay for more than one streaming service. Many believe existing Netflix subscribers are unlikely to cancel their subscription to pay for other services. IAC IAC.O Chairman Barry Diller told CNBC in July that Disney has the best chance of catching up to Netflix \u201cbecause of its very, very popular content.\u201d  Apple will not directly compete with Amazon Inc's AMZN.O Prime Video because that service is bundled with other perks of Prime membership - most significantly, free one- or two-day delivery on most Amazon orders.  Next spring, Apple will face another significant rival in television: HBO. The forthcoming HBO Max, from AT&T T.N's WarnerMedia, likely priced at $16 to $17 per month, has a library of HBO, Warner Bros and other content, and is investing in original content as well.  Apple, which is spending $2 billion on original content this year, is sitting on $210.6 billion in cash. \u201cApple has the firepower to outspend a company like Disney by a wide degree,\u201d said media analyst Rich Greenfield. \u201cIf Apple makes great content, people will subscribe.\u201d  For now, Apple TV+\u2019s greatest advantage is its reach and its scale.

The two companies have been in a dispute since August, when the game maker tried to avoid Apple\u2019s 30% fee on some in-app purchases on the App Store by launching its own in-app payment system.  That prompted Apple to kick Epic\u2019s Fortnite game off the App Store and threaten to terminate an affiliated account that would have effectively blocked distribution of Unreal Engine, a software tool used by hundreds of app makers to create games.  Epic Games founder and Chief Executive Tim Sweeney said Apple\u2019s control of its platform had tilted the level playing field.  \u201cThe 30% they charge as their app tax, they can make it 50% or 90% or 100%.

When a company called it an infringement of intellectual property rights and demanded a revision, Apple threatened to end their business relationship, the report said.  The FTC had no immediate comment. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","165":"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea\u2019s Hyundai Motor Co said on Monday it is not now in talks with Apple Inc on autonomous electric cars, just a month after it confirmed early-stage talks with the tech giant, sending the automaker\u2019s shares skidding.  Wiping $3 billion off its market value, Hyundai\u2019s stock slid 6.2%. Shares in its affiliate Kia Corp, which had been tipped in local media reports as the likely operational partner for Apple, tumbled 15% - a $5.5 billion hit.  The announcement brings the curtain down on weeks of internal divisions at Hyundai Motor Co Group - parent to both automakers - about the potential tieup, with some executives raising concerns about becoming a contract manufacturer for the U.S. tech giant in a tieup reminiscent of electronics firm Foxconn\u2019s role in making device for Apple like the iPhone.  \u201cWe are receiving requests for cooperation in joint development of autonomous electric vehicles from various companies, but they are at early stage and nothing has been decided,\u201d the automakers said on Monday, in compliance with stock market rules requiring regular updates to investors regarding market rumours.  \u201cWe are not having talks with Apple on developing autonomous vehicles.\u201d  Kia shares had jumped 61% since Hyundai initially confirmed a local media report early in January that Apple and Hyundai were in discussions to develop self-driving electric vehicles by 2027 and develop batteries at U.S. factories operated by either Hyundai or Kia.  \u201cApple and Hyundai are in discussion, but as it is at early stage, nothing has been decided,\u201d Hyundai said, before releasing subsequent statements that removed all mentions of Apple but said Hyundai was receiving electric car cooperation requests from parties it didn\u2019t identify.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  As recently as last week, media outlets including CNBC reported that a deal was close to being finalised. One South Korean report said the two companies were set to sign the deal on Feb. 17.  \u2018AGONISING\u2019  Hyundai is traditionally known for its reluctance to work with outsiders, making engines, transmissions and even its own steel in-house in a vertically integrated supply chain as South Korea\u2019s second-largest conglomerate.  Although shares in Kia and Hyundai had surged on news of the talks, internal opposition to becoming an Apple contract manufacturer was considerable, according to people familiar with the matter.  \u201cWe are agonising over how to do it, whether it is good to do it or not,\u201d a Hyundai executive aware of internal discussions on the tie-up told Reuters in January. \u201cWe are not a company which manufactures cars for others,\u201d he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Apple and Hyundai first started talks over a car partnership in 2018, another person familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. But progress was hampered by the South Korean automaker\u2019s reticence on working with outsiders, the person said.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Reuters reported in December that Apple was moving forward with autonomous car technology and aimed to produce a passenger vehicle that could include its own breakthrough battery technology as early as 2024.  Apple, known to keep product plans under tight wraps, has never acknowledged talks with the automaker about building vehicles, and wasn\u2019t immediately available for comment outside business hours in the United States.  Analysts said talks might have collapsed over leaks of the partnership plan to media, or over possible insistence by Apple that Hyundai\u2019s role in any tieup would be that of an equipment manufacturer, rather than a strategic partner.  \u201cWith numerous news reports over discussions between the two companies, which should have been held to non-disclosure agreements, it would have been uncomfortable\u201d said Kwon Soon-woo, an analyst at SK Securities.  Kevin Yoo, an analyst at eBEST Investment & Securities, said, \u201cIt seems clear that Hyundai Motor Group has not been too happy with dealing with Apple ... They made it clear that they do not want to be treated just as Apple\u2019s supplier or manufacturer.\u201d","166":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A scathing report detailing abuses of market power by four top technology companies suggests a tough road ahead of new rules and stricter enforcement for Big Tech should Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden win the White House.  Antitrust experts and congressional aides said the 449-page report from the antitrust panel of the House Judiciary Committee, released on Tuesday, lays out a road map for the Democratic Party to put the brakes on the dominance of Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc.  With the Nov. 3 election approaching fast and a new Congress scheduled to be sworn in in January, action on the report\u2019s recommendations this year is unlikely and no new legislative changes are imminent. However, the findings boost the chances for new laws in the future and will inform existing investigations against large technology companies by state attorneys general and agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission.  The report reflects the views of Democrats on the antitrust subcommittee in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. Republicans on the panel released two separate reports on the investigation.  U.S. Representative David Cicilline, chairman of the House antitrust panel, told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday he thinks a Biden administration would be receptive to the report. \u201cHe (Biden) has talked about how Big Tech platforms abuse their power,\u201d said Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat. \u201cHe recognizes that this sort of economic concentration undermines democracy.\u201d  Sarah Miller, executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, a Washington-based group focused on monopoly power, said the report \u201clays out the Democratic Party\u2019s position on tech platforms and how antitrust laws need to be refined and strengthened.\u201d  \u201cThe report has done a lot of work to set up where and why a Biden administration should act and how it should prioritize the recommendations in the report,\u201d she added. Miller is one of hundreds of members of the Biden campaign\u2019s tech policy committee.  William Kovacic, a former chair of the Federal Trade Commission, warned that the companies will \u201cpull out all the stops\u201d in lobbying against the changes.  Earlier this month, Reuters reported how large tech companies including Amazon were cozying up to the Biden campaign with cash and connections.  Biden has previously said antitrust enforcement has not been strong and that tech firms deserve a hard look from the federal agencies that oversee competition. He has stayed away from calling for the breakup of large technology companies, saying it would be premature to do so without a formal investigation.  The House report on Tuesday broadly recommended that companies should not both control and compete in related businesses, but stopped short of naming a specific company. Anti-monopoly experts and congressional aides said the report, which details Big Tech\u2019s abuses, has the potential to influence the thinking of Biden on the issue.  A spokesman for the Biden campaign did not immediately comment.  The antitrust panel will take up the majority report after the October recess for formal adoption and will have a vote on it, counsels for the committee said. The next step will be coming up with legislation to put the report\u2019s recommendations into action.  House panel chairman Cicilline also said in the interview he expects legislation tackling Big Tech\u2019s market power to be introduced in the current Congress and more bills to be introduced next year.","167":"TAIPEI, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Apple iPhone maker Foxconn has received Chinese government approval to resume production at a key plant in the southern city of Shenzhen, a source with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters late on Monday.

The Fitness+ service is Apple\u2019s first subscription geared to make money directly from the sensor-packed device it has been selling since 2014.  The service, which Apple said will be available by the end of the year, has new workouts each week filmed by a team of trainers in a purpose-built studio in Los Angles and focuses on exercises that require little or no gym equipment, using Apple Watch sensors to track progress.

Apple's move to cut its quarterly sales forecast blaming slowing iPhone sales in China sent U.S. stock futures and Asian shares tumbling, with MSCI's broadest gauge of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan falling 0.6 percent. Vietnam's index was the top loser in the region, plunging 1.5 percent to an over one year closing low. \"Vietnam is tightly caught up in the tech story. We are becoming a very large tech hub for a lot of the outflow from tech companies based in China,\" said Fiachra Mac Cana, head of research at Ho Chi Minh Securities. Vietnam is the largest smartphone production base for South Korean mobile phone giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , while the country's largest earner from exports are smartphones. \"For us, it's like if demand for iPhones are weak, will demand for Samsung phones also be weak then? Yes, very easily. All of that makes the Vietnamese market a complete risk off environment right now,\" he added. Singapore's benchmark index also tumbled, with electronic equipment maker Venture Corp Ltd among top percentage losers, shedding 1.8 percent. Thailand's energy-heavy index see-sawed throughout the session to end lower, with energy stocks slumping in tandem with falling oil prices amid worries over lower fuel demand in 2019 and surging crude supplies. However, defying the broader Asian downturn was Philippine's index, which soared 2.6 percent to close at a near one-month high, ahead of inflation data due on Friday. A Reuters poll shows that the country's inflation is expected to cool to a six-month low in December. \"Investors were mainly concerned about inflation during 2018... so now we're seeing some buying in the index stocks as there's better expectation on earnings growth,\" said Rachelle C Cruz, an analyst at AP Securities.

The tech giant\u2019s reversal, about two years ago, has not previously been reported. It shows how much Apple has been willing to help U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies, despite taking a harder line in high-profile legal disputes with the government and casting itself as a defender of its customers\u2019 information.  The long-running tug of war between investigators\u2019 concerns about security and tech companies\u2019 desire for user privacy moved back into the public spotlight last week, as U.S. Attorney General William Barr took the rare step of publicly calling on Apple to unlock two iPhones used by a Saudi Air Force officer who shot dead three Americans at a Pensacola, Florida naval base last month.  U.S. President Donald Trump piled on, accusing Apple on Twitter of refusing to unlock phones used by \u201ckillers, drug dealers and other violent criminal elements.\u201d Republican and Democratic senators sounded a similar theme in a December hearing, threatening legislation against end-to-end encryption, citing unrecoverable evidence of crimes against children.  Apple did in fact did turn over the shooter\u2019s iCloud backups in the Pensacola case, and said it rejected the characterization that it \u201chas not provided substantive assistance.\u201d  Behind the scenes, Apple has provided the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation with more sweeping help, not related to any specific probe.  An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the company\u2019s handling of the encryption issue or any discussions it has had with the FBI. The FBI did not respond to requests for comment on any discussions with Apple.  More than two years ago, Apple told the FBI that it planned to offer users end-to-end encryption when storing their phone data on iCloud, according to one current and three former FBI officials and one current and one former Apple employee.  Under that plan, primarily designed to thwart hackers, Apple would no longer have a key to unlock the encrypted data, meaning it would not be able to turn material over to authorities in a readable form even under court order.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  In private talks with Apple soon after, representatives of the FBI\u2019s cyber crime agents and its operational technology division objected to the plan, arguing it would deny them the most effective means for gaining evidence against iPhone-using suspects, the government sources said.  When Apple spoke privately to the FBI about its work on phone security the following year, the end-to-end encryption plan had been dropped, according to the six sources. Reuters could not determine why exactly Apple dropped the plan.  \u201cLegal killed it, for reasons you can imagine,\u201d another former Apple employee said he was told, without any specific mention of why the plan was dropped or if the FBI was a factor in the decision.  That person told Reuters the company did not want to risk being attacked by public officials for protecting criminals, sued for moving previously accessible data out of reach of government agencies or used as an excuse for new legislation against encryption.  \u201cThey decided they weren\u2019t going to poke the bear anymore,\u201d the person said, referring to Apple\u2019s court battle with the FBI in 2016 over access to an iPhone used by one of the suspects in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California.  Apple appealed a court order to break into that phone for the FBI. The government dropped the proceedings when it found a contractor that could break into the phone, a common occurrence in FBI investigations.  Two of the former FBI officials, who were not present in talks with Apple, told Reuters it appeared that the FBI\u2019s arguments that the backups provided vital evidence in thousands of cases had prevailed.  \u201cIt\u2019s because Apple was convinced,\u201d said one. \u201cOutside of that public spat over San Bernardino, Apple gets along with the federal government.\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  However, a former Apple employee said it was possible the encryption project was dropped for other reasons, such as concern that more customers would find themselves locked out of their data more often.  Once the decision was made, the 10 or so experts on the Apple encryption project - variously code-named Plesio and KeyDrop - were told to stop working on the effort, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.  APPLE SHIFTS FOCUS  Apple\u2019s decision not to proceed with end-to-end encryption of iCloud backups made the FBI\u2019s job easier.  The agency relies on hacking software that exploits security flaws to break into a phone. But that method requires direct access to the phone which would ordinarily tip off the user, who is often the subject of the investigation.  Apple\u2019s iCloud, on the other hand, can be searched in secret. In the first half of last year, the period covered by Apple\u2019s most recent semiannual transparency report on requests for data it receives from government agencies, U.S. authorities armed with regular court papers asked for and obtained full device backups or other iCloud content in 1,568 cases, covering about 6,000 accounts.  The company said it turned over at least some data for 90% of the requests it received. It turns over data more often in response to secret U.S. intelligence court directives, which sought content from more than 18,000 accounts in the first half of 2019, the most recently reported six-month period.  Had it proceeded with its plan, Apple would not have been able to turn over any readable data belonging to users who opted for end-to-end encryption.  Instead of protecting all of iCloud with end-to-end encryption, Apple has shifted to focus on protecting some of the most sensitive user information, such as saved passwords and health data.  But backed-up contact information and texts from iMessage, WhatsApp and other encrypted services remain available to Apple employees and authorities.  Apple is not the only tech company to have removed its own access to customers\u2019 information.  In October 2018, Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google announced a similar system to Apple\u2019s dropped plan for secure backups. The maker of Android software, which runs on about three-quarters of the world's mobile devices, said users could back up their data to its own cloud without trusting the company with the key.

That rare forecast cut exposed weakening iPhone demand in China, the world\u2019s biggest smartphone market, where a slowing economy has also been buffeted by a trade war with the United States.  Many analysts and consumers have said the new iPhones are overpriced.  Apple asked its suppliers late last month to produce fewer-than-planned units of its XS, XS Max and XR models, the Nikkei reported, citing sources with knowledge of the request.  The request was made before Apple announced its forecast cut, the Nikkei said. The bleaker sales outlook, which Apple attributed to weak China demand, triggered a broad sell-off in global stock markets.  Market research firm Canalys estimates shipments fell 12 percent in China last year and expects smartphone shipments in 2019 to dip another 3 percent, to below 400 million for the first time since 2014.  Overall planned production volume of both old and new iPhones is likely to be cut to a range of 40 million to 43 million units for January-March period, from an earlier projection of 47 million to 48 million units, the Nikkei reported, citing one source familiar with the situation.

The report comes after chip suppliers Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS and Skyworks Solutions Inc SWKS.O flagged weak first-quarter chip demand for smartphones.  Samsung surprised the market on Tuesday with an estimated 29 percent drop in quarterly profit, blaming weak chip demand in a rare commentary issued to \u201cease confusion\u201d among investors already fretting about a global tech slowdown.  Apple's iPhone suppliers include Taiwanese assemblers Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn) 2317.TW and Pegatron Corp 4938.TW. Pegatron declined to comment on the report when contacted by Reuters, while Foxconn did not reply to a request for comment.  There was little reaction to the report among shares of major Apple suppliers, as the market has already digested production cuts after the iPhone maker\u2019s forecast cut, analysts said.  Shares of Foxconn, the world\u2019s biggest electronics contract manufacturer, closed up 1.6 percent, while Pegatron closed up 1.3 percent. Apple shares were up 1.3 percent at $152.70 in early trading on Wednesday.  Among iPhone component suppliers in Asia, South Korea's LG Display Co Ltd 034220.KS closed up 0.5 percent, while Japan Display Inc 6740.T was flat.  \u201cThe Street is already well aware of a soft March guide so this latest report is not a new worry, as investors are starting to look ahead 6-9 months down the road for Apple and gauge how the company emerges from this dark chapter of soft demand,\u201d Daniel Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said.  As Chinese demand has faltered, Apple has increased focus on India, which recently overtook the United States as the world\u2019s second-largest smartphone market.  Chief Executive Tim Cook reiterated in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday that India was a major focus for Apple.  Reuters reported last month that Apple will begin assembling its top-end iPhones in India this year through the local unit of Foxconn, citing a person familiar with the matter.","179":"* HSI -0.3 pct, HSCE flat; IT hardware makers lead losses  * Apple Inc suppliers decline after company cuts forecast  * Chinese stocks lacklustre as economic concerns persist  HONG KONG, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks eased on Thursday after a rare revenue warning from Apple Inc spooked technology and hardware shares, and as investors found little support from the performance of Chinese equities. ** The Hang Seng index edged down 0.3 percent to 25,064.36, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises index closed flat. ** The struggling market mostly followed trading in mainland China, where the Shanghai Composite index ended flat but the blue-chip CSI300 index and most of its sub-indexes fell. ** The sub-index tracking energy shares rose 1.2 percent, the financial sector ended 0.5 percent lower, while property stocks rose 0.91 percent. ** Shares of I.T. hardware makers led the losses with a 1.6 percent drop.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  NEW YORK\/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple is known for the cleanness of its smartphone designs, yet its TV plans have until now been full of static. On Tuesday, the $970 billion company made things a tad clearer, by announcing that its new Apple TV+ package will be cheaper than rivals. That doesn\u2019t guarantee it will be a smash hit, but it\u2019s enough to get a bunch of people trying it out, which will help Chief Executive Tim Cook with a longer-term goal.  At $5 a month, Apple\u2019s offering costs less than half the $13 charged by Netflix for its most popular plan, and the hitherto competitive $7 charged by Walt Disney for its own over-the-top product announced earlier this year. That adds a price war to the content war already underway. Netflix, Amazon and Disney have spent billions on programming. Apple has $102 billion of net cash to dip into. It has committed $6 billion for original shows and movies, the Financial Times reported in August. That puts it in line with Amazon\u2019s spending budget on programming.  Regardless, Apple TV is likely part of a larger strategy shift from hardware to subscription revenue. One tell is that the company is giving away a free year of service with the purchase of an iPhone, iPad or Mac. That\u2019s a decent way of getting customers on the hook to pay Apple recurring fees. Apple also unveiled a subscription gaming service for $5 a month for a family. While the content is limited that may not matter. Video customers are accustomed to playing a favorite game for months at a time. The fact they are family-friendly is a much-needed bonus: no ads, no in-game purchases and no data collection.  For the nine-months ending June 29, Apple\u2019s service revenue represented 20% of its $196 billion in sales. It\u2019s growing at a fast clip, some 16% over the period compared to the same period a year ago. That compares with Apple\u2019s flagship stream of hardware revenue, which declined. Keeping the trajectory of services going is growing more critical. It\u2019s not hard to see how Apple will start small, then bundle a series of services to keep customers regularly shelling out \u2013 not unlike Amazon\u2019s Prime membership. Apple TV, in other words, makes most sense as a pilot for more dramatic things.","181":"Jan 28 (Reuters) - Apple Inc said on Monday that it will issue a software patch later this week for a bug that lets iPhone users hear audio from users that have not yet accepted a video call.

The justices said they would hear Apple\u2019s appeal of a lower court\u2019s ruling that revived the proposed class-action lawsuit by iPhone buyers over commissions that the Cupertino, California-based technology company receives through its App Store.  The case could expand the threat of antitrust damages against companies in the rapidly growing field of electronic commerce, which generates hundreds of billions of dollars annually in U.S. retail sales.  President Donald Trump\u2019s administration backed Apple and urged the justices to take the case.  Businesses that potentially could be threatened by such consumer litigation are electronic marketplaces like the App Store, ticket site StubHub, Amazon\u2019s Marketplace and eBay where individual sellers set prices.  The antitrust claims against Apple date back to a 2011 lawsuit by several iPhone buyers in California federal court, including lead plaintiff Robert Pepper of Chicago, according to court papers. The plaintiffs said Apple has monopolized the sale of apps like messaging programs and games, leading to inflated prices compared to if apps were available from other sources.  Though developers set the prices of their apps, Apple collects the payments from iPhone users, charging developers a 30 percent commission on each purchase. Developers earned more than $20 billion in 2016, according to Apple.  The company sought to have the antitrust claims dismissed, saying the plaintiffs did not have the needed legal standing to bring the lawsuit.  The case hinges on a 1977 U.S. Supreme Court decision that limited damages for anti-competitive conduct to those directly overcharged rather than indirect victims who paid an overcharge passed on by others.  A federal judge in Oakland, California threw out the suit, saying the consumers were not direct purchasers because the higher fees they paid were passed on to them by the developers.  But the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017 revived the litigation, saying Apple was a distributor that sold iPhone apps directly to consumers and must face the antitrust claims.  E-commerce reached $452 billion in U.S. retail sales in 2017, according to U.S. government estimates.","184":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese online retailers have started discounting iPhones for the second time this year as Apple Inc wrestles with a prolonged sales slowdown in the world\u2019s largest smartphone market.  Several electronics vendors announced discounts on iPhone devices this week, following mass discounts in January just before Apple reported sinking sales in China.  Gadget retailer Suning.Com Co Ltd said it would slash the price of the iPhone XS by as much as 1,000 yuan ($148.95) from its official price. Suning had lowered the prices of other iPhone models in January along with other retailers, but those cuts excluded the iPhone XS.  Pinduoduo Inc, an e-commerce site best known for selling inexpensive goods, has also said it would sell the 64GB edition of the iPhone XS for 6,999 yuan, a drop of over 1,000 yuan from the official price.  Online retail giant JD.com Inc said it would offer discounts on a range of Apple products including the iPhone XS and XS Max, with models of the latter device selling at discounts of up to 1,700 yuan. Like Suning, JD.com initially did not discount the iPhone XS upon its first major round of discounts in January.  Apple, JD.com and Pinduoduo did not respond to requests for comment, while Suning could not be reached.  Apple\u2019s sales from China declined 20 percent year-on-year, according to its most recent earnings report. Slowing demand for smartphones and increased competition from local brands have chipped at its dominance in the country.

Yet the company has partnered with Ant Financial, the finance arm of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, and several state-owned banks to let consumers purchase iPhones via interest-free loans.","185":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O held talks with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS and MediaTek Inc 2454.TW along with existing vendor Intel Corp INTC.O to supply 5G modem chips for 2019 iPhones, according to an Apple executive's testimony at a trial between Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Friday.  FILE PHOTO: A chef walks past an Apple store in Beijing, China January 7, 2019. REUTERS\/Thomas Peter  Between 2011 and 2016, Apple relied on San Diego-based Qualcomm as the sole supplier of such chips, which help iPhones connect to wireless networks. Starting in 2016, Apple split the business between Intel and Qualcomm, but in 2018, Apple moved solely to Intel for its newest phones.  But Apple supply chain executive Tony Blevins testified on Friday that Apple has also considered MediaTek and Samsung, one of its largest rivals in the smart phone market, to supply the chips for the next generation of wireless networks known as 5G. Those networks are expected to start rolling out this year and provide faster data speeds than current 4G networks.  The FTC is suing Qualcomm alleging the chip supplier engaged in anticompetitive patent licensing practices to preserve a dominant position in the premium modem chip market.  On the stand at a federal courthouse in San Jose, California, Blevins testified that Apple has long sought multiple suppliers for modem chips but signed an agreement with Qualcomm to exclusively supply the chips because the chip supplier offered deep rebates on patent license costs in exchange for exclusivity.  In 2013, Apple broke off work with Intel to start supplying modems for the iPad Mini 2 because Apple would lose its rebates by using Intel\u2019s chips, rendering Intel\u2019s products \u201ceconomically unattractive\u201d overall.  Later that year after cost negotiations with Qualcomm did not go as Apple hoped, Apple kicked off \u201cProject Antique\u201d to secure a second modem supplier, Blevins testified.  By 2016 and 2017, Apple introduced Intel\u2019s modems in some of its iPhones but also still used Qualcomm chips. But Apple\u2019s lawsuit against Qualcomm filed in early 2017 caused their business relationship to change \u201cin a very profound and negative manner,\u201d leading to using only Intel\u2019s modems for the phones released last year.  \u201cThe entire concept of Project Antique was to find a second supplier. No offense to (Intel) but we don\u2019t want to be single supplier with them. We wanted both Qualcomm and (Intel) in the mix,\u201d Blevins said. Blevins also testified Apple considered making Intel the sole supplier of modems for the Apple Watch, which added 4G connectivity in 2017 using Qualcomm chips.  Blevins said that talking with Samsung, whose Galaxy and Note devices compete against the iPhone, is \u201cnot an ideal environment\u201d for Apple, but that Samsung is currently the largest component supplier to Apple.  Blevins did not say whether Apple had reached a decision on a 5G modem supplier or whether it would release a 5G iPhone in 2019. Citing sources, Bloomberg previously reported that Apple would not release such a phone until 2020.","186":"Nov 18 (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Wednesday said it plans to start a program to lower its App Store commissions for software developers who make $1 million or less in proceeds each year from the store.  Apple takes a 30% cut of most purchases made on the App Store, although the commission drops to 15% for subscriptions that remain active for more than a year.  Apple said Wednesday developers will automatically get the lower 15% rate if they generate $1 million or less in proceeds - defined as the portion of App Store purchases that the developer keeps - in a calendar year.  Apple\u2019s App Store fees and rules have come under fire from both large software firms such as Microsoft Corp, Spotify Technology SA and Match Group Inc as well as numerous startups and smaller companies that allege the fees deprive consumers of choices and push up the price of apps.  Apple has responded by saying its rules apply evenly to developers and that the App Store provides an easy way to reach its huge base of users without having to set up payment systems in the 175 countries where it operates.  Apple said the new program will start on Jan. 1, 2021.  Software developers who netted less than $1 million from the App Store this year will qualify for the 15% rate next year. If the developer\u2019s proceeds rise above the $1 million threshold the next year, Apple\u2019s standard rates kick in for the rest of that year. If the developer\u2019s proceeds fall below $1 million in a given year, they become eligible for the lower rate the next year.  \u201cSmall businesses are the backbone of our global economy and the beating heart of innovation and opportunity in communities around the world,\u201d Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said in a statement.

REUTERS\/Charles Platiau  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple has old age and experience going for it. The $965 billion firm reported on Tuesday a 5 percent decline in quarterly revenue, but it did better than analysts anticipated. Meanwhile, Alphabet shares tanked even as it posted 17 percent growth in the top line. The Silicon Valley giants are both searching for the next big thing. Lower expectations and generous handouts give Apple more cushion.  Apple\u2019s decline was driven almost entirely by weaker iPhone sales, which fell 17 percent. More consumers are pocketing the product longer because of better computing power, a higher price tag and features that haven\u2019t changed much. Still the company\u2019s overall revenue of $58 billion exceeded analysts\u2019 forecast, according to Refinitiv.  Chief Executive Tim Cook has been in charge since 2011 but he hasn\u2019t yet managed to introduce a product as dazzling or impactful as the iPhone. What he has done is gain traction with services, which include Apple Music and money skimmed from app purchases. Those activities now account for almost 20 percent of the business.  In the meantime, the company is accelerating the return of capital to shareholders. Apple forked over more than $27 billion in buybacks and dividends in the quarter, a record payout and more than double the amount in the previous quarter. That buys a lot of patience.  Alphabet doesn\u2019t get the same credit. The parent of Google reported on Monday that revenue growth slowed in the first quarter, and the $37 billion haul missed what analysts were expecting. Investors responded by knocking $68 billion off the company\u2019s market value on Tuesday. By contrast, Apple\u2019s stock jumped 5 percent after the market closed which, if it holds, would add roughly $50 billion to its valuation.  Because of Alphabet\u2019s youth \u2014 it went public 24 years after Apple did \u2014 expectations of growth are much higher, as is the bar for meeting them. Before the latest share price movements, Alphabet was worth 27 times projected earnings in the next year while, Apple was valued at less than 17 times.

The justices will hear arguments in Apple\u2019s appeal of a lower court\u2019s decision to revive the proposed class-action lawsuit by a group of iPhone users. The lawsuit accused the Cupertino, California-based technology company of violating federal antitrust laws by requiring apps to be sold through the company\u2019s App Store and then taking a 30 percent commission from the purchases.  The case hinges on how the justices will apply one of its past decisions to the claims against Apple. That 1977 ruling limited damages for anti-competitive conduct to those directly overcharged rather than indirect victims who paid an overcharge passed on by others.  The iPhone users, including lead plaintiff Robert Pepper of Chicago, filed the suit in a California federal court in 2011, claiming Apple\u2019s monopoly leads to inflated prices compared to if apps were available from other sources.  Though developers set the prices of their apps, Apple collects the payments from iPhone users, keeping a 30 percent commission on each purchase. One area of dispute in the case is whether app developers recoup the cost of that commission by passing it on to consumers. Developers earned more than $26 billion in 2017, a 30 percent increase over 2016, according to Apple.  The company, backed by Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s administration as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told the justices in legal papers that siding with the iPhone users who filed the lawsuit would threaten the burgeoning field of e-commerce, which generates hundreds of billions of dollars annually in U.S. retail sales.  The plaintiffs, as well as antitrust watchdog groups, said closing courthouse doors to those who buy end products would undermine antitrust enforcement and allow monopolistic behavior to expand unchecked. The plaintiffs were backed by 30 state attorneys general, including from Texas, California and New York.  The plaintiffs said app developers would be unlikely to sue Apple, which controls the service where they make money, leaving no one to challenge anti-competitive conduct.  The company sought to have the antitrust claims dismissed, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked the required legal standing to bring the lawsuit. A federal judge in Oakland, California threw out the suit, saying the consumers were not direct purchasers because the higher fees they paid were passed on to them by the developers.

Brooks Kraft\/Apple Inc.\/Handout via REUTERS  In a decision on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said shareholders led by a UK pension fund can sue over Cook\u2019s comment on a Nov. 1, 2018, analyst call that while Apple was facing sales pressure in some emerging markets, \u201cI would not put China in that category.\u201d  Apple told suppliers to curb production a few days after Cook spoke, and on Jan. 2, 2019, unexpectedly cut its quarterly revenue forecast by up to $9 billion, which Cook blamed in part on pressure on China\u2019s economy from U.S.-China trade tensions.  The lowered revenue forecast was the first by Cupertino, California-based Apple since the iPhone\u2019s launch in 2007. Shares of Apple fell 10% the next day, erasing $74 billion of market value.  Apple and Cook have said there was no proof they defrauded or intended to defraud the plaintiffs. The company did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment.  In a 23-page decision, Rogers said shareholders plausibly alleged that Cook\u2019s statements on the analyst call about China were materially false and misleading.  She said that while Cook might not have known specifics about \u201ctroubling signs\u201d in China that the company had begun seeing, it \u201cstrains credulity\u201d he would have been in the dark about the trade tensions and their possible impact on Apple.  The plaintiffs raised a \u201cstrong inference\u201d that Cook knew about the risks when discussing China on the analyst call, and a \u201ccogent and compelling inference that Cook did not act innocently or with mere negligence,\u201d Rogers wrote.  Rogers, who works in Oakland, California, also dismissed claims related to demand for the iPhone XS and XS Max.

Goldman\u2019s foray into retail banking began in 2015 and has accelerated under Chief Executive David Solomon, who took the helm last year. Because Goldman does not have branches, it has been trying to get attention for products offered by its consumer bank, Marcus, through promotions and partnerships.  Called Apple Card, the card will use the MasterCard payment network. While consumers will receive a physical card, Apple and Goldman hope users will store payment information in the iPhone wallet app and make purchases without needing to carry the card.  The Apple alliance will push the brand much further into the mainstream than Goldman\u2019s prior efforts, analysts said. Effectively, the Goldman Sachs-Apple card will become the vehicle for people who want to buy pricey smartphones, computers and other gadgets from one of the world\u2019s most popular consumer brands.  \u201cThere is a great deal of buzz,\u201d said Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg, comparing Goldman\u2019s offering to JPMorgan Chase & Co\u2019s popular Sapphire credit card. \u201cWe expect solid issuance right out of the box.\u201d  There were 1.4 billion active Apple devices, 900 million of which were iPhones, as of January. The company has been emailing potential customers about the new credit card\u2019s launch, with Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook saying last week that it would soon appear in stores.  On Friday, Goldman Sachs released terms and conditions, including details on interest rates and rewards.  Although there is excitement on Wall Street, analysts have expressed concern about Goldman\u2019s plunge into retail.  For one, the bank has precious little experience dealing with Main Street borrowers. Many economists and analysts believe the United States is overdue for a recession, which makes the timing of Goldman\u2019s card roll-out less than ideal.  Bank executives said last month that they have tamped down efforts to grow consumer loans because of heightened credit risk. As of July, Marcus had a $6 billion book of unsecured loans, which mostly stem from consumers who consolidated existing credit-card debt into a cheaper product. Marcus also held more than $50 billion in retail deposits.  As the business has grown, analysts complain that Goldman is not disclosing enough details about the people it is lending to, such as their credit scores or delinquency rates. They also worry that Goldman is spending a lot on something that is unlikely generate meaningful profits for some time.  Over the past few years, Goldman has spent $1.3 billion, before taxes, on new business initiatives, Goldman Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr told analysts last month. The initiatives are the Apple card, Marcus\u2019 digital offerings and a transaction banking product.  Those three projects dragged down Goldman\u2019s return-on-equity by 60 basis points in the second quarter, Scherr said. But he predicted they will bolster profits once they are running at full-scale.  Analysts believe Goldman\u2019s credit-card endeavor will be fruitful over the long-run, even if it takes awhile to get off the ground.  A few years from now, the card will only represent 1-2% of Goldman\u2019s earnings, Wells Fargo & Co analyst Mike Mayo predicted. But, he said, the bank has the advantage of starting from scratch, unlike rivals that are dealing with costly branch networks and old technology.  \u201cThese are two iconic brands that are partnering to better compete as part of the 21st century digital banking wars,\u201d May told Reuters. \u201cIt is part of Goldman\u2019s pivot.

Picture taken January 29, 2020. REUTERS\/Aly Song  HONG KONG\/NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple could finally make investors as concerned as the wider population about the latest novel coronavirus. The iPhone maker warned on Monday that quarterly revenue would fall short of the $63 billion to $67 billion guidance it provided a few weeks ago because of supply and demand problems in China. The ripple effects from the outbreak may now become more apparent.  Apple\u2019s brick-and-mortar stores in China remain closed. Third-party vendors and online sales haven\u2019t provided a sufficient cushion. The tech titan said while its manufacturing partners have no factories in Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus, operations elsewhere in the country were \u201cramping up more slowly than we had anticipated.\u201d  This sort of double whammy may affect Apple more than many companies. Chinese customers account for nearly a fifth of revenue and essentially all iPhones are assembled there by partner Foxconn, which has slowly started reopening plants. With many workers trapped at home, however, staffing them is proving difficult. Interdependencies between component makers mean one small missing piece or stalled factory can grind the whole production system to a halt.  Everything from vitamins to cars depends on materials and parts from China, which remains a dominant producer of intermediate components. This widget economy may not be sexy, but it is essential. Nintendo, which already moved its Switch console manufacturing out of China, recently said it couldn\u2019t produce as many of them as it wants because of Chinese factory shutdowns.  More worrisome than video games are pharmaceuticals. China is the biggest producer of many drugs, and the sole provider of chemicals needed to make them. Four out of five U.S. antibiotics come from the People\u2019s Republic, U.S. Food and Drug Administration chief Scott Gottlieb recently told Congress. And many of the biggest Chinese chemical companies that supply drugmakers are headquartered in Wuhan, where SARS-CoV-2 first struck.  Despite a litany of corporate cautionary notes, the S&P 500 has traded nearly 5% higher this year. Chinese benchmark indices also have bounced back since the initial shock of the virus news. Following Apple\u2019s announcement, which came amidst a U.S. holiday market closure, Australia\u2019s technology index dipped 3%. That\u2019s the first sign that maybe a $1.4 trillion company will sound the necessary alarm.","198":"Slideshow ( 4 images )  HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finnish game company Rovio has released an augmented reality game called Angry Birds Isle of Pigs, developed with Swedish game studio Resolution Games for Apple\u2019s mobile devices, the Finnish games developer said on Tuesday.

REUTERS\/Thomas Peter  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Privacy is building a wider moat for Apple\u2019s margins. The iPhone maker\u2019s premium prices and fast-growing services continued to power earnings in the latest quarter. Selling hardware rather than advertising once seemed like a weakness. But in the wake of Facebook\u2019s woes, CEO Tim Cook is using data security to buff the brand \u2013 and profitability.  The $940 billion company is all about the iPhone, and it sold 41.3 million of them in the recent quarter. Although that number represented a rise of only 1 percent from the same period last year, revenue from the handset line jumped 20 percent as the company sold lots of the high-end iPhone X. That model\u2019s price tag starts at around $1,000.  Moreover, the company sold more services to users. Increased app sales and in-app purchases from the likes of hit games like \u201cFortnite,\u201d as well as rising usage of the company\u2019s Apple Pay and Apple Music offerings, resulted in $9.5 billion of revenue. That\u2019s an increase of 31 percent from last year.  These services can pull double duty for shareholders, providing both income - helping push overall earnings to $11.5 billion in the quarter - and potentially a higher stock multiple, as they generate revenue that\u2019s both more stable and rising faster than the iPhone\u2019s. The stock jumped more than 2 percent in the first half hour after the results were released, pushing the company\u2019s valuation closer to the $1 trillion mark.  Supporting both of these trends, at least somewhat, is Apple\u2019s focus on user privacy. The phenomenal growth of Facebook and Alphabet\u2019s Google in recent years made Apple\u2019s reluctance, or inability, to tap the online advertising market seem unfortunate. But a recent string of scandals surrounding targeted ads on social media has prompted investors to reconsider the durability and growth of businesses such as Facebook and Twitter. In this climate, Apple\u2019s different business model is a distinct positive.  The focus on protecting user data doesn\u2019t appear directly on Apple\u2019s top line. But it buttressed the brand in the same way that the company\u2019s approach to security does. The firm\u2019s insistence on controlling software, hardware and what apps are sold in Apple\u2019s online store pays off in less malware - and helps create the perception that the iPhone is a luxury good. Irritation over micro-targeted ads and data breaches hasn\u2019t become as important as hardware security yet. But each scandal makes privacy a bigger selling point for Apple.","211":"NEW YORK, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Wall Street\u2019s main stock indexes closed at record levels on Friday, fueled by fresh optimism over a potential calming of U.S.-China trade tensions and by big gains in shares of healthcare companies.

FILE PHOTO: CEO Tim Cook speaks at an Apple event at their headquarters in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 10, 2019. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  The brief was filed on behalf of the company and Cook as an individual as well as Deirdre O\u2019Brien, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of retail and people. The company said it has 443 employees who have benefited from the program, which was implemented in 2012 by the Republican Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama.  Cook has previously criticized Trump\u2019s hardline immigration policies, including his plan to end the program, but has generally maintained a close relationship with the president. They have dined together at least twice and Cook has regularly spoken with Trump about the economic impact of U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made goods.  The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments on Nov. 12 over Trump\u2019s 2017 plan to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Trump\u2019s move to rescind DACA was blocked by lower courts.  The program currently shields about 700,000 immigrants often called \u201cDreamers,\u201d mostly Hispanic young adults, from deportation and provides them work permits, though not a path to citizenship.  More than 100 companies, including Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and IBM Corp, joined a brief backing \u201cDreamers\u201d at an earlier stage of the litigation.  Cook\u2019s brief stated that the motivation for weighing in on one of the biggest cases before the Supreme Court in its new term that starts on Monday was to support of the company\u2019s diverse workforce.  \u201cAmong those people are hundreds of DACA recipients who had no say in the decision to travel to this country and have known no other home,\u201d the brief stated.  \u201cThey spark creativity and help drive innovation. They are among our most driven and selfless colleagues,\u201d the brief said.  Cook\u2019s brief is likely to be one of many filed in support of DACA recipients in the coming days ahead of a Friday deadline.  A Supreme Court decision is due by the end of June, in the thick of next year\u2019s presidential race in which Trump is seeking re-election. Democratic presidential candidates including Joe Biden have pledged actions to protect the Dreamers and offer them citizenship.  Apple\u2019s big tech rival Microsoft Corp has been part of the legal challenge against Trump\u2019s DACA effort from the beginning, expressing similar concerns about how its employees would be affected.  Others that have challenged Trump\u2019s action include the University of California, labor unions and various states including California and New York.  Trump and Cook had a previous tussle after the Wall Street Journal reported in June that Apple planned to move production of a new high-end Mac Pro computer from Texas to China.  Cook publicly said that Apple wanted to keep making the machines in the United States, and the company in July asked for tariff exemptions on imported parts.  Trump said he would refuse to grant the exemptions but hoped Apple would build a plant in Texas. Last month, his administration lifted tariffs on some of the parts used to make the computers, and days later Apple said it would make the computers in Texas.","213":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - During the last three months of 2020, Apple Inc delivered its flagship iPhone 12 model weeks later than normal iPhone debuts and shuttered some of its stores due to the pandemic.  But Wall Street is still expecting a near-record sales quarter for the Cupertino, California company\u2019s signature device when it reports fiscal first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, with estimates of $59.8 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv as of Jan. 26. If Apple beats the number, it could eclipse its all-time record of $61.58 billion in iPhone sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.  Analyst largely attribute the boost to the timing of the iPhone 12 lineup, which had a new look, 5G cellular data connectivity and new models at the top and bottom of the sizing range.  \u201cThey have an extremely good understanding of what their refresh cycle looks like and when waves are possible and whey they are not,\u201d said Ben Bajarin, head of consumer technologies at Creative Strategies. \u201cEvery bit of data across China and Europe has shown that not only was the installed base getting older, but people were not refreshing. I think (Apple) knew it would be heavy refresh cycle.\u201d  Analyst also expect strong Mac sales of $8.69 billion, according to Refinitiv data from Jan. 26, thanks in part to the introduction of models with the first central processor chip for its laptops and desktop that Apple designed itself. Overall, analysts expect $103.28 billion in sales and earnings per share of $1.41 for Apple\u2019s fiscal first quarter.  A \u201csuper cycle\u201d of booms in iPhone sales after several more modest years are not new to Apple - the company\u2019s previous high came after it announced the iPhone X, with a new design. During previous cycles, Apple\u2019s shares often traded at lower price-to-earnings ratios than its rivals due to Apple\u2019s dependence on the iPhone.  But those ratios have risen over the past year, and analyst Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein wondered how much further they can go.  \u201cAt 33x consensus (fiscal year 2021 earnings per share), and buyside expectations above the Street\u2019s, we struggle to see case for material outperformance in (Apple), absent a surprise product announcement or migration to a bundled hardware subscription model,\u201d he wrote in a note to clients.","214":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window)  * Futures: Dow dips 0.02%, S&P up 0.28%, Nasdaq up 1.00%  Sept 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Tuesday, as Apple share climbed and upbeat manufacturing sector surveys in China and Europe set the tone for United States factory activity data, due later in the day.

But Goldman is entering a crowded market for co-branded cards where retailers often have the upper hand, and analysts question how much tolerance its shareholders will have for growing the bank\u2019s fledgling consumer business through credit card lending.  Goldman has been courting consumers since the 2016 launch of its online bank Marcus, and with its first credit card it is targeting fee-conscious ones. There will be no annual or late fees, and customers will pay variable annual interest rates of between 13.24 percent and 24.24 percent, according to Apple\u2019s website.  Apple and Goldman did not disclose the economic terms of their partnership when it was announced on Monday.  But banks have been increasingly willing to take less favorable deals because post-financial crisis regulations make the credit card business attractive for lenders, which are required to hold less capital against such debt than against other assets.  \u201cAs this kind of benign credit environment continues retailers have a greater leverage than they had a few years ago,\u201d said a person involved in similar credit card deals.  Issuing banks retain control of approving customers for cards, often using data the retailer has on shoppers as part of the process, the person said.  Goldman Chief Executive David Solomon said in an email to employees on Monday that the card is a \u201cmajor step\u201d in the bank\u2019s plan to grow its consumer business.  Solomon has said the consumer business is a critical part of the bank\u2019s strategy to grow revenues and cut costs, as revenue shrinks in traditional areas of strength for Goldman like bond trading.  But many investors have been uneasy with Goldman growing its unsecured consumer debt, especially at a time when many speculate that a recession could be looming, said UBS analyst Brennan Hawken.  Marcus now has $45 billion in customer deposits in the United States and the U.K., and has issued $5 billion in personal loans, according to Solomon\u2019s email.  While the amount of loans is small compared to the bank\u2019s overall balance sheet, Hawken said investors would likely prefer Goldman stick to using its consumer business to add deposits, as opposed to personal loans or credit card debt.  \u201cPeople want Goldman to be Goldman,\u201d Hawken said. Goldman declined comment for this article.  The Apple Card\u2019s wide interest rate range indicates that some customers might have lower credit scores, said Josh Siegel, chief executive of StoneCastle Financial Corp. However, the bank may not necessarily keep that risk on its books.  \u201cThey might securitize the debt, which wouldn\u2019t be anything new for an investment bank,\u201d Siegel said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that Goldman Sachs, all of a sudden, especially with where we are in the credit cycle, is going to go long on unsecured consumer debt.\u201d  As this is Goldman\u2019s first foray into credit cards, it may take the bank a year or two to assess the quality of its credit decisions, according to an industry expert who declined to be named.  The same person said that the stated range of possible interest rates on unpaid balances was too wide to clearly show how much credit risk Goldman expects to take.  Credit risk concerns aside, analysts said that Goldman\u2019s decision to launch its first credit card in partnership with one of the world\u2019s biggest companies gives it the opportunity to gain consumer market share.  While Apple says its card is \u201ccreated by Apple, not a bank,\u201d according to its website, the Goldman Sachs logo will appear on the back of the card.  \u201cFor Goldman this is a play for massive distribution without having to contort too much,\u201d said Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy and partner at Autonomous Research.  \u201cIt makes their brand way better at least in the retail and mass affluent marketplace.\u201d","221":"May 3 (Reuters) - Apple supplier Skyworks Solutions Inc reported a 7.2 percent rise in quarterly revenue on Thursday, helped by higher demand for its radio frequency chips.

The justices rejected Apple\u2019s appeal in the long-running case in which a federal jury in 2016 found that Apple had infringed VirnetX\u2019s patents and awarded $302 million. A judge later increased that amount to $439.7 million including interest and other costs.  The case dates back to 2010 when Nevada-based VirnetX filed suit in federal court in the Eastern District of Texas accusing Cupertino, California-based Apple of infringing four patents for secure networks, known as virtual private networks, and secure communications links. VirnetX said Apple infringed with its FaceTime and VPN on Demand features in products such as the iPhone and iPad.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, which specializes in patent disputes, upheld the judgment against Apple last year.  During the litigation, Apple and other companies requested that a tribunal of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office review the validity of the VirnetX patents. The tribunal canceled key parts of the patents at issue in the case.  But in separate decisions also issued last year, the Federal Circuit set aside certain of the tribunal\u2019s rulings, bringing VirnetX closer to collecting damages from Apple. Apple appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that the damages should be recalculated because the specific patents VirnetX accused it of infringing with FaceTime were nearly wiped out.  Apple in a court filing called the Federal Circuit\u2019s refusal to entertain its demands \u201clegally wrong and grossly unfair.\u201d The company also said the lower courts impermissibly allowed VirnetX to request damages far beyond the value of the patented invention.

Amazon sold a limited assortment from Apple previously that included Mac computers and Beats headphones.  The deal underscores how top brands such as Apple and Nike Inc NKE.N, which long resisted distributing products via Amazon, are increasingly turning to the e-commerce site because it has become a critical channel for reaching customers. Amazon has taken a harder line on counterfeit goods as well.  As of Jan. 4, Amazon will rid its site of Apple products from third-party merchants not authorized by the Cupertino, California-based technology company. Still, shoppers will be able to find non-branded accessories - like headphones - that are compatible with Apple devices.  Third-party merchants will be allowed to sell as they have been through the holiday season, while Amazon will add Apple products to its official Apple at Amazon page.

FILE PHOTO: Japan Display Inc's logo is pictured at its headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, August 9, 2016. REUTERS\/Kim Kyung-Hoon\/File Photo  The pullout of Harvest, which had offered to inject three quarters of the bailout, is a severe blow for Japan Display, which has been hit by Apple\u2019s slowing iPhone sales and a late shift to organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens.  But Minoru Kikuoka, Japan Display\u2019s chief financial officer, said at a press briefing there were no worries about an immediate cash crunch, thanks to loans extended by Japanese government-backed fund INCJ, its biggest shareholder.  Harvest decided to pull out due to disagreements with other members of the investor group over governance, Japan Display said. The Japanese company will look for new investors to replace the Chinese fund while keeping up talks with Harvest with the aim of receiving promised investment, it added.  Meanwhile, a major Japan Display client, which sources said is Apple, intends to double its planned investment to $200 million, if Japan Display could find other investors to partially replace Harvest by the end of this year, Japan Display said.  Apple Japan was not immediately available for comment.  Apple accounted for 60.6% of Japan Display\u2019s revenue in the last financial year ended March. Japan Display still owes Apple nearly $900 million for the $1.5 billion cost of building a smartphone screen plant four years ago.  Hong Kong-based activist investor Oasis Management is still sticking with its plans to contribute $150-180 million. In addition, a major supplier and other private equity funds are showing interest in joining the deal, Kikuoka said.  \u201cThose investments would make enough funds to keep our business going,\u201d he said, although he declined to specify when the investments would be made.  The investments would give the investor group a 49.8% stake in Japan Display, replacing Japanese government-backed fund INCJ as Japan Display\u2019s biggest shareholder.  Japan Display first agreed on the bailout deal with the Chinese group in April, but was forced to change the structure as some members dropped out after making checks on Japan Display\u2019s financials.  Japan Display in August reported a tenth consecutive quarterly loss and logged a negative net worth, with liabilities exceeding assets by 77.2 billion yen.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar  (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Monday released the results of a study that found its App Store spurred $458 billion in sales last year from categories such as retail of physical goods, ride-hailing and advertising from which the iPhone maker takes no commission.  The study, backed by Apple, marks the first time the company has sought to quantify App Store activity that does not produce a commission for Apple. Commissions from the App Store, which is the only way developers can distribute apps to iPhones owned by consumers, have become a key sales driver for Apple as iPhone sales level off.  But Apple\u2019s study suggested the App Store has a broader impact. The App Store generated $519 billion in billings and sales in 2019, according to the study, conducted by economic research consulting firm Analysis Group. Of that amount, $413 billion was from physical goods and services.  The study found $45 billion came from in-app advertising. The remaining 15% of overall App Store activity - about $63 billion - came from digital goods and services such as music and video subscriptions or in-app purchases in games.  Apple takes a commission of between 15% and 30% for digital goods and services purchased through the App Store. That practice has drawn antitrust scrutiny in the United States and Europe, with rivals such as Spotify Technology Ltd saying the practice hurts their business.  To avoid paying Apple\u2019s commissions, rivals like Spotify must ask their customers to sign up for subscriptions on their own website, which adds multiple extra steps compared with paying inside the App Store. Spotify has alleged that created an uneven playing field.  In a conference call with journalists, Apple representatives said the company commissioned the study to gain a better understanding of the physical goods and services activity in its App Store.  General retail apps on iPhones and iPads, including Amazon.com, generated an estimated $268 billion in sales and billings, followed by travel apps at $57 billion and ride-hailing apps at $40 billion.","230":"(Reuters) - Three of Apple Inc\u2019s former top semiconductor executives in charge of iPhone chips have founded a startup to design processors for data centers, aiming to take on current industry leaders Intel Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

Courtesy NUVIA Inc\/Handout via REUTERS  NUVIA Inc was founded by Gerard Williams III, Manu Gulati and John Bruno in early 2019 and is developing a processor code-named Phoenix. The company on Friday said it raised $53 million from Dell Technologies Capital and several Silicon Valley firms, which will help it expand from 60 employees to about 100 by the end of this year.  The company\u2019s founders, backers and plans have not been previously reported.  Williams left Apple this spring after more than nine years as chief architect for all Apple central processors and systems-on-a-chip. Gulati spent eight years at Apple working on mobile systems-on-a-chip, and Bruno spent five years in Apple\u2019s platform architecture group. Gulati and Bruno also worked for Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google before coming to NUVIA.  At NUVIA, the group\u2019s goal is to take the lessons learned designing powerful chips for small, battery-powered devices such as iPhones and apply them to large, electricity hungry data center servers. The founders aim to make a chip that is faster, more power efficient and more secure than existing data center processors, Williams told Reuters.  \u201cWe want to bring all these aspects that we have developed over time through our careers to this new market and really exploit them in this market, because it\u2019s an area ripe for innovation and advancement,\u201d Williams told Reuters in an interview.  Chip suppliers Qualcomm Inc, Marvell Technology Group and Ampere Computing, a startup founded by Intel\u2019s former president, are all also trying to take on Intel and AMD in the server market with chip technology previously used in mobile phones.  But Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategies, said NUVIA could prove a formidable new entrant based on its founding team\u2019s track record. He said the team made \u201cunprecedented\u201d performance gains with each new generation of chips at Apple.  \u201cI\u2019ve been in and around semiconductor companies for 30 years. There are never any guarantees, but one thread that I\u2019ve seen is that the most successful chip companies have rock star architects and developers,\u201d Moorhead said.  Among NUVIA\u2019s investors is Dell Technologies Inc\u2019s venture arm. Dell is one of Intel\u2019s biggest customers. Scott Darling, president the venture group and himself a veteran of Apple and Intel, said he could not comment on whether Dell will use NUVIA\u2019s chips.  \u201cThe silicon industry is relentless. It pounds forward,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cYou have to have a world-class team to do something disruptive enough that it will prevail despite the response of competitors.

Palladium notched an all-time high, driven by short supplies of the auto-catalyst metal.  Spot gold was up 1.3% at $1,601 per ounce as of 1:55 p.m. EST (1855 GMT) after hitting $1,605.10, the highest since Jan. 8, earlier in the session.  U.S. gold futures settled 1.1% higher at $1,603.60 an ounce.  \u201cThe equity markets are under pressure and gold is still being viewed as a quintessential safe-haven asset as we do get some negative news in this case in regards to coronavirus and its effects on the global economy,\u201d said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures.  Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable technology company, said it was unlikely to meet its March-quarter sales forecast because the coronavirus outbreak was pressuring its supply chain.  The surprise sales warning knocked global equities off record highs and fed buying of safe-haven assets.  \u201cThere are concerns that this whole coronavirus situation may be little worse than many expected and the implication is that central banks around the world will be somewhat more dovish and the market is staring to price this reality in,\u201d said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategies at TD Securities.  China\u2019s central bank cut the interest rate on its medium-term loans on Monday as policymakers sought to reduce the economic shock from the virus outbreak.  The death toll in China had climbed to 1,868, the National Health Commission said, and the World Health Organization said \u201cevery scenario is still on the table\u201d in terms of the epidemic\u2019s evolution.  \u201cGold continues to make these moves sideways to higher in the midst of a traditionally firmer dollar which has the tendency to limit or cap commodities moves shows how strong the gold market is,\u201d High Ridge Futures\u2019 Meger said.

Palladium gained 2.8% at $2,592 an ounce, after hitting an all-time high of $2,592.02.  \u201cThis can be only partly explained by the ongoing production problems in South Africa due to power supply disruptions and this year\u2019s renewed high supply deficit,\u201d Commerzbank analysts said in a note.

REUTERS\/Fabrizio Bensch\/File Photo  The Austrian group shied away on Tuesday from a full-year earnings forecast after a downturn in 2018 results, saying shorter order cycles reduced visibility in a difficult market environment.  Investors punished the Swiss-listed firm\u2019s already battered shares also for its decision to no longer provide a mid-term guidance figure, sending the stock down 15 percent.  The shares tumbled 75 percent last year while the European sector index lost 11 percent and Apple shares 9 percent.  \u201cGiven a market we are seeing that is very volatile and hard to read and also demand that is smaller than we had envisaged, we see first quarter sales of $350-390 million,\u201d Chief Executive Alexander Everke said at a news conference in Zurich.  That is a fall of more than 20 percent compared to last year\u2019s period and to the fourth-quarter.  \u201cCertainly we see the second half of the year 2019 better than the first half,\u201d Everke said on an investor call, when asked about earnings prospects but did not give details.  AMS\u2019 statement added to a bleak earnings season for semiconductor companies and further stoked fears of an industry slowdown after sales warnings from Apple, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor last month pointed to stagnating smartphone demand and a cooling Chinese economy.  German chipmaker Infineon Technologies on Tuesday revised down its guidance for full-year revenue growth.  APPLE DEPENDENCY  AMS provides Apple with optical sensors for 3D facial recognition features on its newest iPhones and has been hit by slow sales of the devices. Technological challenges have made it hard for AMS to reduce its dependency on Apple, which analysts estimate accounts for 45 percent of sales.  Management was, however, optimistic in this regard.  \u201cWe do have a significantly better pipeline for the Android mobile business for the first quarter and also second quarter and the quarters to come. This is a big difference to last year,\u201d Everke said on the investor call.  So far, China\u2019s Xiaomi is the only maker of Android-based smartphones that AMS has disclosed as a customer. Analysts say Huawei\u2019s [HWT.UL] Mate20 Pro phones also use AMS\u2019s sensors.  Analysts pointed to another challenge for the firm after AMS reported a 38 percent increase in net debt end-December and a 46 percent fall in its order backlog.  \u201cMarket focus is going to be on the cash generation (and) debt management before focus shifts to any new wins that will aid 2020 development given the difficult 2019 environment,\u201d JP Morgan analysts said.  The group is still considering options for its business with environmental sensors but has already switched staff from that unit to new projects, Everke said.  After a strategic review, AMS in October decided to reduce its focus on environmental sensors, which detect temperature or moisture.  Asked about market speculation that rivals might be interested in buying AMS, he said: \u201cOur strategy is to stay independent.\u201d","233":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc reported sharp growth in its services business on Tuesday and Chief Executive Tim Cook said trade tensions between the United States and China were easing, helping boost the company\u2019s shares after hours even though iPhone sales dipped in the holiday shopping quarter for the first time.  Apple said sales for the current quarter would most likely be lower than Wall Street expected, a signal that it continues to face weak demand for the iPhone, especially in China, the world\u2019s biggest smartphone market.  But investors focused on the company\u2019s growing services, which include Apple Music and its App Store.  \u201cThe services number is good, and that is the growth engine going forward that people will continue to focus on,\u201d said Ivan Feinseth, an analyst with Tigress Financial Partners.  Cook, who is in regular contact with U.S. President Donald Trump, said there were signs of a detente in trade tensions with China, which may have depressed sales of its phones.  \u201cIf you were to graph up trade tension it\u2019s clearly less in January than it was in December,\u201d Cook told Reuters in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that the two countries will be able to work things out.\u201d  The company\u2019s shares rose 6 percent to $163.50 in after-hours trading. They had fallen more than 30 percent since November on concerns about weak iPhone sales and a general decline in high-tech stocks. Shares of iPhone suppliers including Micron Technology , Broadcom Inc and Skyworks Solutions rose more than 1 percent in extended trade after Apple\u2019s report.  \u201cIt appears that the bears pressed way too hard on the negative bets and even this more negative report couldn\u2019t drive the stock lower,\u201d said Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel.  SUBSCRIBERS UP  Apple said revenue from services, which investors are counting on to fuel growth, reached $10.8 billion, in line with Wall Street estimates. Services gross margin hit 63 percent, up from 58.3 percent a year ago. Analysts previously estimated the services gross margin could top 60 percent.  \u201cThey get more efficient as they get larger,\u201d Cook told Reuters.  The company said it has 360 million subscribers to both its own and third-party services, and set a goal to expand that to 500 million by the end of 2020. It said it has 1.4 billion active devices, an increase of 100 million from last year, and that 900 million of those are iPhones.  Apple said it would start providing regular updates on the number of iPhones and overall devices in use - what is known in the tech industry as the installed base. The company stopped reporting unit sales of its iPhones the latest quarter.  FILE PHOTO - People use their phones outside an Apple store in Beijing, China January 7, 2019. REUTERS\/Thomas Peter\/File Photo  Apple counts both subscribers to its own services as well as Apple device users who subscribe to outside apps or services using Apple\u2019s payment systems. Apple keeps up to 30 percent of the payments it handles.  Apple\u2019s iPhone revenue declined 15 percent year-over-year to $51.9 billion. Cook said China\u2019s economic weakness hurt iPhone sales there.  He said Apple is rethinking how it prices the iPhone outside the United States after largely setting the price in U.S. dollars, which made the phones more expensive in local currencies as the dollar strengthened.  In markets with currencies that weakened considerably against the dollar over the last year, iPhone price \u201cincreases were obviously more,\u201d Cook told Reuters. \u201cAnd so as we\u2019ve gotten into January and assessed the macroeconomic condition in some of those markets, we\u2019ve decided to go back to more commensurate with what our local prices were a year ago in hopes of helping the sales in those areas.\u201d  OUTLOOK LARGELY BELOW WALL STREET  Apple said it expects revenue between $55 billion and $59 billion for the current quarter ending in March, largely below analysts\u2019 average estimate of $58.83 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  For the quarter ending in December, the company\u2019s busiest due to the holiday shopping season, Apple reported revenue of $84.3 billion, slightly above analysts\u2019 average estimate of $84 billion. Apple warned in early January that sales would miss the targets it gave in November.  Earnings per share were $4.18, compared with Wall Street\u2019s average estimate of $4.17, according to Refinitiv data.  Investors have been closely tracking the company\u2019s share repurchase activity in hopes that it will help buoy the falling share price, which has knocked Apple off its throne as the world\u2019s largest technology company with a market value of more than $1 trillion.  Apple said it bought back $8.2 billion worth of shares in the quarter ended in December, less than half the $19.4 billion it purchased in the quarter ended in September. Apple said its net cash position - cash minus its debt - was $130 billion, up from $123 billion in the previous quarter. Apple has publicly said it plans to draw its net cash position to zero.  Some investors were disappointed Apple did not take advantage of low prices over the last quarter to buy back more stock.

(Reporting by Takashi Umekawa; Editing by Sonali Paul and Himani Sarkar)","235":"Sept 10 (Reuters) - Apple Inc is set on Tuesday to announce pricing for its forthcoming streaming TV service as well as updates to its iPhone lineup, as the tech giant reaches a turning point where it focuses as much on services as its hardware and software.  The annual upgrade to the iPhone is expected to include new camera features but few big changes, with Apple in a \u201cholding pattern\u201d until it rolls out 5G phones with faster mobile data speeds next year, analysts said. Instead, services like the television content featuring the likes of Oprah Winfrey that will compete with Netflix Inc and Walt Disney Co could take center stage.  While the iPhone still makes up more than half of Apple\u2019s sales, Tuesday\u2019s event may nudge it off center stage after a decade in the limelight.  Apple long boasted about its competitive advantage over rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, which makes handsets, or Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, which provides the Android operating system for most of the world\u2019s phones. Apple touted controlling both the hardware and software, resulting in polished products that commanded premium prices and captured most of the smart phone industry\u2019s profits.  But at the fall event at 10 a.m. PT (1700 GMT) in the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California, typically Apple\u2019s splashiest and dedicated to its flagship devices, Apple is cementing a third element to its focus: hardware, software and services.  The new strategy, which Apple hinted at an event in March where it gave some details about the streaming TV service, comes as iPhone sales have declined year-over-year for the past two fiscal quarters and investors are fixed on the growth potential for services.  Questions about how Apple will price its television service, and whether it will bundle it with its streaming music products, will weigh on the minds of Wall Street and analysts just as much as whether the Apple TV hardware box gets an upgrade or how many cameras the iPhone has. Apple has not yet given a specific launch date or price.  \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ll get to see Apple\u2019s strategy with all three parts of the business,\u201d said Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies.  With streaming content, Apple is entering a crowded field. Since Apple\u2019s initial television event in March, rivals like Walt Disney Co have since announced a $6.99 per month service that will contain that firm\u2019s iconic children\u2019s content.  With no historic library of television content of its own, Apple will sell its own service - Apple TV+ - even as it already serves as a reseller of other channels like HBO and, analysts believe, takes a cut of sales. Bajarin said Apple\u2019s challenge is to persuade consumers that its family of devices, from its set-top box to phones, are the best one-stop place to watch shows, despite the fact that Netflix has yet to come on board with the integrated viewing system. (Netflix remains available as a standalone app on Apple devices, and its shows appear in search results in the Apple TV app.)  \u201cNetflix is sort of gaping void\u201d in the Apple TV app \u201cbut they\u2019ve got Amazon and all the channels on board,\u201d Bajarin said. \u201cThe vast majority of content providers are playing nice with Apple TV.\u201d  Apple is also likely to unveil updates to the iPhone and Apple Watch. Analysts expect the iPhone to feature better cameras, and perhaps new chips to help handle the work of sensors on the device, but few new blockbuster features. Those are not expected until next year, when Apple is expected to have a 5G device capable to taking advantage of faster mobile data networks.  \u201cI believe we are in an incremental holding pattern until 5G. Customers with iPhone X and beyond likely won\u2019t have a reason to upgrade,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy.  In terms of pricing, most analyst expect prices to remain unchanged from the last year\u2019s models, between $749 and $1,099 depending on size and features. Apple makes much of its profits on selling memory upgrades to devices with larger storage capacity, and Moorhead said falling memory chip prices could help Apple absorb the cost of tariffs on Chinese-made goods, which are expected to hit mobile phones starting Dec. 15.  \u201cThankfully storage and memory prices have declined so instead of taking more profit, I see Apple eating the cost and not raising prices,\u201d Moorhead said. \u201cI can also see Apple leaning heavily on its supply chain to eat some of the cost.\u201d (Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)","236":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window)  * Tesla, Apple advance as stock split takes effect  * Aimmune Therapeutics soars on Nestle\u2019s $2 bln buyout offer  * Suitors for Tiktok U.S. slip as deal may need China nod  * Indexes: Dow drops 0.58%, S&P flat, Nasdaq up 0.65% (Adds comment, details; Updates prices)  Aug 31 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 hovered near record highs on Monday as bets on a rebound in economic activity due to prolonged central bank support put the index on course for its best August in more than three decades.

Shortly afterward, Intel Corp said it will exit the smartphone modem chip business.  FILE PHOTO: Silhouette of mobile user is seen next to a screen projection of Apple logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  The entire drama played out as the mobile phone industry prepares to shift to a technology called 5G.  Echoing complaints from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Apple had alleged that Qualcomm used its patent licensing business to keep a monopoly on modem chips that connect devices like the iPhone to wireless data networks. Qualcomm insisted that Apple was using its valuable technology without proper payment, and Apple later dropped Qualcomm\u2019s chips in favor of those from Intel.  In the end, Apple and Qualcomm ceased all litigation, with Apple signing a six-year licensing deal with Qualcomm and also agreeing to buy Qualcomm chips. Hours later, Intel said it was getting out of the modem chip business. [nL3N21Y466]  WHAT IS 5G?  5G is a new network technology for wireless communications that could be up to 100 times faster than current 4G networks. The networks are coming on line in the United States, China, South Korea and other places this year, but probably will not be widespread until 2020. Modem chips connect devices like phones to these networks.  WHO ARE THE PLAYERS IN 5G?  Prior to Tuesday, five companies had disclosed 5G modem chips or plans to make them: Qualcomm, Intel, MediaTek Inc, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Samsung and Huawei, however, only make chips for their own mobile phones.  WHY DOES APPLE CARE ABOUT 5G?  Some of Apple\u2019s rivals in the smartphone market - notably Samsung - plan to release 5G devices this year, which could put pressure on Apple to match the feature. Many carriers that are investing heavily to build 5G networks are also likely to put their marketing efforts behind 5G phones.  WILL APPLE HAVE A 5G PHONE THIS YEAR?  It would require an extraordinary effort from both companies. New modems take months of testing to ensure phones will work on carrier networks. Under traditional time lines, Apple would have needed to start testing a 5G iPhone last year, but its supplier Intel did not have a chip ready.  WILL APPLE LOSE MARKET SHARE WITHOUT A 5G PHONE?  Apple was slow to 4G too and did not pay a price. Samsung and others released 4G phones in 2011 as the networks were rolling out. Apple waited until 2012, when 4G networks become widely accessible. Many analysts believe Apple is making the same bet with 5G.  WHY DOES APPLE NEED QUALCOMM\u2019S CHIPS?  Apple\u2019s only current modem supplier, Intel, said that it would not have a 5G chip ready until 2020, which could have pushed Apple\u2019s launch of a 5G iPhone into 2021 - a long enough delay that it could hurt sales. Qualcomm, on the other hand, is preparing to ship its second generation 5G chip and can meet Apple\u2019s needs with its current products.  WILL APPLE EXCLUSIVELY USE QUALCOMM\u2019S CHIPS?  Not necessarily. While Apple and Qualcomm signed a supply agreement, Apple is working on developing its own modems and disclosed in court earlier this year that it has held talks with MediaTek and Samsung around modems.  WHY DID INTEL SHARE RISE AFTER IT EXITED THE MODEM BUSINESS?  Intel Chief Executive Bob Swan has told investors in the past that modem chips are not likely to fetch the same high margins as its CPU chips. Intel has plenty of other ways to make money from 5G, like selling CPUs to makers of base stations and so-called programmable chips to makers of networking gear.

Shares of Microsoft rose 0.6 percent to end the week at $110.89, putting its market capitalization at $851.2 billion. Apple shares fell 0.5 percent to $178.58 on the day, adding up to a market value of $847.4 billion.  The two stocks jostled for the top spot over the course of the week, with Microsoft\u2019s stock market value exceeding Apple\u2019s at several points in intra-day trading but not at the close.  Both companies\u2019 market capitalizations were calculated using outstanding shares reported in their most recent 10-Q filings.  Apple\u2019s market capitalization overtook Microsoft\u2019s in 2010 as Microsoft struggled with slow demand for personal computers, due in part to the explosion of smartphones like the iPhone.  After Satya Nadella took over as chief executive in 2014, Microsoft reduced its reliance on Windows software for PCs and became a major player in cloud computing, second only to Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.  In recent months, technology shares have been punished by investors worried about rising interest rates and the potential consequences of the U.S.-China trade war.  Apple shares are now 19.6 percent lower than on Nov. 1, when the company warned after the regular session that holiday-quarter sales would likely miss Wall Street expectations.  Global demand for smartphones has slowed in recent years.  Thirty-three analysts recommend buying Microsoft\u2019s stock, with just one sell rating and one neutral, according to Refinitiv data.  Twenty-five analysts have positive ratings on Apple, 16 are neutral and none recommend selling, the data show.  Analysts on average expect Microsoft\u2019s revenue to increase 12.7 percent for its fiscal year 2019 ending in June, compared with an estimated 5 percent rise for Apple\u2019s fiscal 2019, which ends in Sept, according to the Refinitiv data.","240":"Japan Display's logo is seen at a display of its products at its headquarters in Tokyo, Japan October 7, 2019.

China reported its fewest new coronavirus infections since January and its lowest daily death toll in a week, but the World Health Organization said data suggesting the epidemic had slowed should be viewed with caution.  Chinese officials reported 1,886 new cases - the first time the daily figure has fallen below 2,000 since Jan. 30. The number of deaths, 98, fell below 100 for the first time since Feb. 11.  Apple said on Monday that manufacturing facilities in China that produce its iPhone and other electronics had begun to reopen, but were ramping up slower than expected.  The disruption in China will result in fewer iPhones available for sale around the world, making Apple one of the largest Western firms to be hurt by the outbreak.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The conflict is but one aspect of the global legal battle between regulators, Apple and Qualcomm, which supplies modem chips that help phones connect to wireless data networks.  Last week, Qualcomm secured a preliminary victory in a patent lawsuit in China that would have banned sales of some Apple iPhones there. Apple later said it believed it was already in compliance but would change its software \u201cto address any possible concern\u201d about its compliance.  But Qualcomm was also handed a setback in an antitrust lawsuit brought against it by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission when a judge said it will not be able to mention that Apple ditched Qualcomm chips for competing ones from Intel Corp when the case goes to trial next month.  Qualcomm representatives did not immediately return a request for comment on Sunday outside of U.S. business hours.  The group of contract manufacturers - which includes Foxconn parent Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, Pegatron Corp, Wistron Corp and Compal Electronics Inc - became embroiled in the dispute between Apple and Qualcomm last year.  In the supply chain for electronics, contract manufacturers buy Qualcomm chips and pay royalties when they build phones, and are in turn reimbursed by companies like Apple. Qualcomm sued the group last year, alleging they had stopped paying royalties related to Apple products, and Apple joined their defense.  The contract manufacturers have since filed claims of their own against Qualcomm, alleging the San Diego company\u2019s practice of charging money for chips but then also asking for a cut of the adjusted selling price of a mobile phone as a patent royalty payment constitutes an anticompetitive business practice.  They are seeking $9 billion in damages from Qualcomm for royalties they allege were illegal. That figure could triple if the manufacturers succeed on their antitrust claims.  Ted Boutrous, a high-profile partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP who is representing the contract manufacturers, told Reuters that statements from Qualcomm executives suggesting there were meaningful settlement talks with the contract manufacturers were \u201cfalse.\u201d  \u201cTo the extent Qualcomm has indicated there have been licensing discussions with the contract manufacturers, they\u2019ve basically made the same sort of unreasonable demands that got them to where they are right now, which impose significant preconditions to even discuss a new arrangement,\u201d Boutrous said.  In July, Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf told investors on the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call that Qualcomm and Apple itself were in talks to resolve the litigation.  At a hearing in the case in San Diego on Nov. 30, one of Apple\u2019s attorneys disputed that notion, saying there had not been \u201ctalks in a number of months. So the parties are at loggerheads and are going ... to have to go into trial.\u201d","248":"FILE PHOTO: A 3D printed Google logo is placed on the Apple Macbook in this illustration taken April 12, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google and Apple Inc AAPL.O on Tuesday announced a new system that will enable public health authorities to use smartphones to assist in contact tracing without having to build an app.  The new system - called Exposure Notifications Express - will allow public health officials to submit a small configuration file to Apple and Google. The two tech companies will then use the file to set up systems that phone owners can opt in to in order to determine whether they have been near someone who has tested positive for the novel coronavirus.  In the case of iPhones, a new version of the iOS operating system being released on Tuesday will alert users whether an exposure notification system is available from local health authorities and allow users to set it up without downloading any new apps. On Android devices, users will also get a prompt from the phone\u2019s operating system, but will still have to download an automatically generated app.  The two companies said Maryland, Nevada, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., will be the first U.S. places to use the new system. The new system also works alongside tools that the two companies released in May that enable public health officials to build apps that allow iPhones and Android devices to use Bluetooth signals to detect proximity to a person who has tested positive.  Six U.S. states and about two dozen countries have launched exposure notification apps based on the Apple-Google technology in recent weeks without major hitches.  The apps are increasingly compatible with each other, allowing for cross-border tracking. A few jurisdictions, such as Hawaii, are moving forward with separate tracking technology.  However, the effectiveness of exposure notification apps in helping slow coronavirus spread remains a major question. Most governments are not tracking detailed data on app usage in the interest of user privacy.  In Alabama, for example, more than 1,000 students caught the virus in an outbreak in August. But a university representative said it was too early to tell whether a two-week-old state app had made any difference.","249":"DUBLIN, March 10 (Reuters) - A worker at Apple Inc.\u2019s European headquarters in Ireland has tested positive for coronavirus.

A Qualcomm sign is seen during the China International Import Expo (CIIE), at the National Exhibition and Convention Center in Shanghai, China November 7, 2018. REUTERS\/Aly Song  The San Diego chipmaker also forecast its fiscal 2019 first-quarter profit above analysts\u2019 estimates, but the better-than-expected outlook was largely due to a one-time tax benefit of about 45 cents per share.  Qualcomm is the world\u2019s biggest supplier of chips for smartphones but it has been battered by a slowdown in the industry and the loss of major customer Apple.  It has also faced repeated challenges to a patent licensing model where it takes a cut of the selling price of a mobile phone, both from antitrust regulators and from customers including Apple, which is suing Qualcomm over its practices.  The iPhone maker has excluded Qualcomm from its new iPhones XS and XS Max and XR that launched in September, instead choosing modem chips from rival Intel Corp INTC.O.  Earlier this summer, Qualcomm warned its shareholders that Apple would likely make that move, but the impact has shown up more swiftly than Wall Street expected.  For Qualcomm\u2019s fiscal first quarter that ends in December, the chip firm forecast revenue of between $4.5 billion and $5.3 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.05 to $1.15 per share. Analysts were expecting revenue of $5.57 billion and earnings of 95 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer George Davis told Reuters that about half of Apple\u2019s chip purchases tended to come during the holiday quarter. Davis said Wall Street analysts may have expected the blow from the Apple loss to be more spread out over the year.  \u201cOur guidance has a reduction of over 50 million (chip) units in the quarter, all of that explained by the absence of being in Apple phones,\u201d Davis told Reuters. \u201cThat\u2019s really the difference.\u201d  On the profit side, Davis said the adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.05 to $1.15 included a 45-cent-per-share benefit from a tax restructuring that would not repeat.  \u201cNet-net, it\u2019s not a disaster,\u201d said analyst Kinngai Chan from Summit Insights Group. \u201cI think Qualcomm can build from here on out with 5G and growth in its adjacent businesses\u201d such as chips for automobiles, Chan said.  Earlier on Wednesday, Reuters reported that Apple is not in talks \u201cat any level\u201d to settle the litigation with Qualcomm, according to a person familiar with the matter. Davis said there was \u201ca lot of focus both internally and externally\u201d on resolving the dispute with licensees, which include Apple, but did not comment on whether the two were in talks about a settlement.  Qualcomm has tried to offset some of the woes related to Apple and the lawsuits by signing more deals with customers that effectively let them pay lower patent licensing rates. It has also reached new deals with large customers like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS.  Also offsetting the Apple impact is a slew of new partnerships between Qualcomm and Chinese mobile phone makers including Xiaomi Corp 1810.HK, Oppo, Vivo and OnePlus, all of which offer lower-cost models in emerging markets like India.  Davis said those Chinese phone makers are increasingly making higher-priced devices that use Qualcomm\u2019s 700- and 800-series Snapdragon chips, which helped improve sales.  \u201cEven though we made some changes to the licensing program that allowed customers to effectively have a lower rate, that came back to us in the form of higher (chip) unit sales,\u201d Davis said.  Qualcomm is also seeking to settle an antitrust lawsuit brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. That effort suffered a setback this week when a federal judge issued a preliminary ruling saying Qualcomm must license its patents to chip industry rivals such as Intel Corp INTC.O.  In a conference call with investors, Qualcomm legal chief Don Rosenberg said settlement talks with the FTC are proceeding despite the ruling.  Excluding items, Qualcomm earned 90 cents per share in its fiscal fourth quarter ended in September, beating analysts\u2019 estimates of 83 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Revenue fell to $5.80 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter, but was still above estimates of $5.52 billion.  Qualcomm\u2019s loss was $493 million, or 35 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a profit of $168 million, or 11 cents per share, a year earlier.

The app was supposed to be the linchpin in Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for a \u201cworld beating\u201d COVID-19 test-and-trace system that would control local flare-ups of the virus and allow the economy to reopen.  But it has been dogged by problems.  An earlier version developed by the National Health Service missed its May target, and in June the government abandoned the centralised technology it was pursuing in favour of a decentralised system developed by Apple and Google.  The revamped app will be trialled on the Isle of Wight off southern England, where a previous version was also tested, and by health workers before being rolled out in the east London borough of Newham to assess how it works at scale.  A national launch date has not been set.  The government said it was confident the new app would detect when a user had been in close proximity to somebody who had tested positive, with seven-out-of-10 contacts within 2 metres correctly notified.  \u201cWe\u2019ve worked with tech companies, international partners, privacy and medical experts to develop an app that is simple to use, secure and will help keep the country safe,\u201d Health Minister Matt Hancock said.  The app records the duration and distance of contacts - for example on a bus - using bluetooth technology and alerts a user if one of their contacts later tests positive for COVID-19. All users remain anonymous and the health ministry stressed that \u201cit tracks the virus, not people\u201d.  It will also let people scan barcode-like QR codes to log visits to public venues.  The government said the app would complement the human test-and-trace programme that has been running since May.  On Monday, the government said the tracing scheme would become more locally targeted, with a reduction in the number of national-level contact tracers.","255":"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Terry Gou, founder of Apple supplier Foxconn 2317.TW, in a surprise move on Monday said he will not contest in Taiwan's 2020 presidential election.

He did not elaborate.  Gou\u2019s decision was a surprise to many amid widespread expectations he could run for the presidency as an independent, a move that could have complicated President Tsai Ing-wen\u2019s re-election bid and spelled trouble for KMT, whose presidential candidate, Han Kuo-yu, is struggling in opinion polls.  \u201cWe always believe that Chairman Gou will make the best decision that benefits the Republic of China,\u201d KMT said in a statement, using Taiwan\u2019s official name.  \u201cWe should let go of the past and look forward. Comrades of the party should unite as one,\u201d it said.  Gou\u2019s extensive businesses in China and ties with Beijing\u2019s top leadership already came under the spotlight, as analysts said they could turn off voters who are increasingly wary of Beijing\u2019s ambition to absorb the island.  He stepped down as chief of Foxconn this year, handing over the running of the company to an operations committee. But he retained a seat on the board of the company, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd.  Self-ruled Taiwan is set to hold presidential and legislative elections in January amid a delicate time with its neighbour China, which considers the island its own and has been ramping up pressure to squeeze Taiwan\u2019s space.","256":"* Apple drops on cutting iPhone production target -WSJ  * Micron falls as China alleges antitrust violations -FT  * China\u2019s JD.com down after quarterly revenue miss estimates  * Futures down: Dow 0.35 pct, S&P 0.37 pct, Nasdaq 0.40 pct  Nov 19 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures dipped on Monday as Apple shares were hit by concerns of slowing demand for iPhones, while conflicting signals of a potential truce in the China-U.S. trade dispute added to market jitters.

FILE PHOTO: The Apple logo is seen on the Apple store at the Marche Saint Germain in Paris, France July 15, 2020. REUTERS\/Gonzalo Fuentes\/File Photo  Investors cheered the Apple and Tesla announcements, helping extend a rally in the companies\u2019 shares, which along with many other technology firms, have soared in value as the market emerged from its pandemic-induced depths in March.  That made owning a piece of these companies seem out of reach of many Main Street investors. Apple closed at over $500 a share on Thursday, while Tesla continued its meteoric rise on Thursday to above $2,200 a share.  Both Apple and Tesla said their actions, a 4-1 and 5-1 split respectively, would let more investors access their shares.  But in the past year, online brokerages like Robinhood, Charles Schwab Corp SCHW.N, and Fidelity, along with several smaller shops, have begun offering slices of individual shares.  \u201cFractional share ownership, all else equal, really does render the price of a stock irrelevant,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG.  That, combined with commission-free trading at most brokerages, has made it easier for anyone with a mobile device to own a piece of a company.  \"People my age grew up with technology and we like to invest in technology-related companies, like Tesla and Amazon AMZN.O and Google GOOGL.O, and if it weren't for fractional shares we wouldn't really be able to take advantage of that,\" said Jaidan Craig, a support technician.  Craig, 23, said he has been investing for two or three years, first on Robinhood, which lets people invest as little as $1 in any listed company, and then moved to a broker called M1, which emphasizes diversifying your investments. He said that without fractional investing, he could not have built as well-rounded a portfolio.  FIRST INNING  While fractional shares have been used for years by mutual funds, they have not as been widely available for stocks until recently, and not every brokerage offers them, helping maintain the appeal of stock splits on some platforms.  TD Ameritrade, a online trading pioneer that is being bought by rival Schwab for $26 billion, does not offer fractional shares, but said it is looking at them.  It noted that in past years, when companies, such as Apple, Google, Mastercard Inc MA.N and Visa Inc V.N, split their shares, retail trading volumes tripled.  \u201cWe have historically seen that our retail investors use stock splits as trading opportunities, accessing popular names that may have gotten too expensive pre-split,\u201d said JJ Kinnahan, TD Ameritrade\u2019s chief market analyst.  Robinhood, which was founded in 2013 and is now valued at $11.2 billion, said that while from a psychological perspective, a stock trading in the thousands appears much more prohibitive than a stock trading in the low hundreds, perceptions are shifting.  \u201cAs fractional shares trading becomes more popular at retail brokerages, the importance and need for stock splits diminish,\u201d said Rebecca Moretti, a writer at Robinhood Snacks.  Just three S&P 500 .SPX members have announced splits in 2020, compared with an average of 10 a year over the past decade, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.  Those companies that have split their shares in the past year have, in fact, underperformed the broader S&P 500, said BTIG\u2019s Emanuel, who likened the current state of fractional investing to the beginning of a baseball game.  \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re in the first inning of it, and yet you have seen a relative underperformance of split shares versus the S&P 500 in 2020, really points to the powerful nature of it,\u201d he said.

Sharp, which makes sensors, camera modules and screens for Apple Inc\u2019s iPhones, said late on Thursday the new plant in Vietnam will make flat screens, electronic devices and air purifiers from the fiscal year starting in April next year.

Apple charges a commission of between 15%-30% for apps that use its in-app payment system and sets out extensive rules that apps must comply with to appear in its App Store, which is the only way Apple allows consumers to download native apps onto devices such as the iPhone.

The justices, on the first day of their new term, declined to review a lower court\u2019s 2018 decision to throw out the $506 million in damages that Apple was ordered to pay after a jury in 2015 decided the company infringed the university\u2019s patent.  The licensing body, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF), filed suit in 2014, alleging infringement of a 1998 patent on a \u201cpredictor circuit\u201d to help speed the way processors carry out computer program instructions. The patent was developed by computer science professor Gurindar Sohi and three of his students at the university, located in Madison, Wisconsin.  WARF, which helps patent and commercialize the university\u2019s inventions, claimed that Apple incorporated the technology in its A7, A8 and A8X processors, found in the iPhone 5s, 6 and 6 Plus, as well as several versions of the iPad tablet.  Apple disputed the claims, saying its processor worked differently based on the specific language spelled out in WARF\u2019s patent.  A federal jury in Madison in 2015 ordered Apple to pay $234 million in damages. A judge later added supplementary damages and royalties based on Apple\u2019s continued infringement through the December 2016 expiration of WARF\u2019s patent, and issued a $506.1 million judgment against Apple in 2017.  But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a specialized patent court located in Washington, last year overturned the jury verdict, saying that based on the \u201cplain and ordinary\u201d meaning of the patent, Apple could not have infringed it.  WARF appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Federal Circuit incorrectly ignored the jury\u2019s understanding of the patent and its role in determining the facts of the case. At the very least, WARF asked the justices to send the case back to the lower court so that it can present more evidence.","270":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apple Inc this week restored a software application to its App Store that let parents control their children\u2019s iPhone usage after removing it in February, the company said on Thursday.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  The deal is part of an ongoing strategy shift for Apple, which is facing weak hardware sales in China and a saturated global smart phone market where users are hanging on to their old iPhones longer than ever, hammering its biggest business.  As a result, Apple is increasingly leaning on its services segment, which includes businesses such as iCloud storage in addition to its music, television and movie content businesses.  It has announced several high-profile deals for original television content, including a forthcoming show with Oprah Winfrey, but has not yet said how it plans to distribute that content or when its service will launch.  The Samsung deal could be a step toward Apple distributing content to devices made by others. Apple makes a device called Apple TV that connects to a full television set, but has never produced a full set itself.  Under the deal unveiled on Sunday, Samsung will add an app to its televisions that lets users browse and play their existing iTunes movies and television shows as well as purchase or rent new content. Samsung also said it would add Apple\u2019s AirPlay 2 software that will allow iPhone owners to stream content from their device to Samsung televisions.  Many existing deals between content companies and smart television makers involve the content companies paying television makers for the right to appear on their devices. Apple and Samsung both declined to comment on whether Apple is paying any fees or a percentage of sales made on the televisions under the new deal.  The impact of iTunes landing on Samsung movies will be muted for now. Since late 2017, consumers who purchased movies through iTunes have been able to watch them on any device, including Samsung televisions, that supported the Movies Anywhere consortium.  Films from Warner Bros, Walt Disney, Universal, Sony and Fox purchased through iTunes, Amazon, Google Play and Vudu could be viewed on the respective apps and devices and TVs that support the apps.  The Samsung deal is the second time in recent months in which Apple has made a pact with another technology company to land its services on their devices. In November, it said its Apple Music streaming service would be made available on Amazon\u2019s Echo smart speakers, despite Apple selling its own line of HomePod speakers that compete directly with Echo speakers.","273":"OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google has a better chance than Apple Inc at defeating Fortnite video game maker Epic Games in court over its allegations the two companies breached anti-trust laws.  FILE PHOTO: A Google logo is shown at one of the company's office complexes in Irvine, California, United States, July 27, 2020. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Epic sued Google and Apple separately in U.S. district court on Thursday, accusing the companies of using their dominance to charge app developers an \u201cexorbitant\u201d 30% fee on sales and impose other restrictions that benefit their own businesses.  Nearly all of the world\u2019s smartphones outside restricted markets such as China come with either Google\u2019s Play store or Apple\u2019s App Store.  But proving Play store rules violate antitrust laws may be more difficult than with the App Store.  While Apple requires all apps be installed through the App Store, Google allows such installation through several different app stores, in one of several key policy differences that could help it beat the allegations of anticompetitive conduct.  Google encourages phone makers to set the Play store as the default, and it erects security roadblocks when users try to download from some other options.  Those practices are drawing scrutiny from U.S. state attorneys general, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters.  But in the end, alternatives exist, said Nicholas Economides, a New York University economics professor who studies online marketplaces.  \u201cHaving other options definitely makes it a bit harder to say something is anticompetitive,\u201d Economides said, speaking generally about app stores.  \u201cWith Apple, things are extreme because there\u2019s no alternative whatsoever. That makes for a stronger potential case.\u201d  Google spokesman Dan Jackson said that most Android phones were sold with multiple app stores installed.  He added that the Play store, in contrast to the App Store, allowed users to access apps paid for elsewhere, without requiring developers to include an in-app purchase option for potential new customers that is subject to the 30% fee.  Google also allows apps to encourage customers to make purchases outside of the app to avoid the fee.  Its greater flexibility last year enabled dating apps maker Match Group, for instance, to start offering its own payment tools in Tinder on the Play store - a tactic barred on the App Store.  Match spokeswoman Vidhya Murugesan expressed support for Epic Games\u2019 lawsuit against Apple, but declined to comment on Epic\u2019s Google filing.  The Netherlands\u2019 competition regulator last year found as part of an investigation of app stores that Apple\u2019s enforcement of its rules \u201cis stricter\u201d than Google\u2019s, \u201cand, as such, the complaints of app providers focus mostly on Apple.\u201d  Developers are more reliant on Apple, with roughly 70% of U.S. app revenue coming from App Store users.  Epic did fine financially when it removed Fortnite from the Play Store for a recent 18-month period and directed users to alternative stores, said Shili Shao, who researched app stores over the last year at Yale University\u2019s Thurman Arnold Project for antitrust studies.  \u201cEpic has a weaker argument against Google because they have not been constrained as much,\u201d Shao said.  Many apps are accustomed to Google collecting fees because they sell ads using its ads software, which collects fees as high as 40%. Developers do not have a comparable relationship with Apple.  The ad business also affords Google a unique way to appease frustrated developers.  While refusing to budge on the 30% app sales fee, Google offered Epic \u201cpreferential terms\u201d on sponsorships and cloud services, according to its lawsuit.  Epic rejected the concession but rival Activision Blizzard Inc took it, the lawsuit said.  Activision, which did not respond to a request to comment, signed a multi-year strategic partnership with Google in January.","274":"Jan 8 (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Wednesday said its Apple News service has reached 100 million monthly active users versus 85 million a year prior, demonstrating growth in a key services business that is being closely watched by investors as iPhone sales decline.

Apple also offers a paid version of its news service called Apple News+ for $9.99 per month but did not disclose subscriber numbers.  Apple gave the figures in its annual early January update on its services businesses. Apple\u2019s overall services segment revenue rose 16% to $46.3 billion in its most recent fiscal year ended on Sept. 28, 2019, while its iPhone segment sales fell 14% to $142.4 billion.

Markets across the world stabilized as the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said he was confident in China\u2019s ability to stem the virus outbreak, which has killed 106 people in the country, prompted businesses to close operations and curbed travel.  Still, the U.S. health secretary said new steps were being considered to counter the virus, including travel restrictions to China.  \u201cObviously, with the China coronavirus uncertainty will breed volatility in the market until there is some sort of endgame to where this thing will be under control,\u201d said Jeff Zipper, managing director of investments at U.S. Bank Private Wealth Management in Florida.  Sectors that were hit hardest on Monday saw their fortunes reverse, with technology and financials among the best performers on the session.  Helping to dampen concerns about a hit from the virus to the economy was data that showed U.S. consumer confidence surged to a five-month high in January.  \u201cThe consumer confidence numbers this morning certainly helped because the consumer seems to be backstopping the market and the economy, in addition to what the Fed has been doing,\u201d said Zipper.  Apple Inc shares led each of the three major indexes higher, up 2.76% ahead of its fourth-quarter results expected after markets close.  Investors will keep a close watch on Apple\u2019s earnings amid concerns of a disruption in iPhone production as the coronavirus spreads across major markets such as China.  Apple\u2019s gains helped lift the S&P technology index 2.01%, while financial stocks gained 1.50% as a climb in Treasury yields helped big banks rebound.

Apple said Ive will continue work on its products at his new venture, but shares fell as much as 1.5% to $197.44 in after-market trading, wiping about $9 billion from the firm\u2019s value.  Ive spent nearly three decades at Apple, leading the design of the candy-colored iMacs that helped Apple re-emerge from near death in the 1990s to the iPhone, regarded by some experts as one of the most successful consumer products of all time.  \u201cIt\u2019s the most significant departure of somebody who was a core part of the growth story\u201d under Jobs, said Ben Bajarin, analyst with Creative Strategies.  Ive joined Apple in 1992 and led Apple\u2019s design teams since 1996. He became chief design officer in 2015.  Ive\u2019s new company will be called LoveFrom, the Financial Times reported, quoting Ive as saying it would be based in California \u201cfor now.\u201d Ive told the newspaper he would work on Apple devices in addition to unspecified \u201cpersonal passions\u201d and non-Apple projects.  \u201cI have the utmost confidence in my designer colleagues at Apple, who remain my closest friends, and I look forward to working with them for many years to come,\u201d Ive said.  Ive\u2019s departure comes amid falling iPhone sales, including a record drop in Apple\u2019s most recent quarter. Sales of some newer hardware products such as the Apple Watch and its wireless AirPods headphones are expanding, but Apple has turned its attention to growing its services business, which includes Apple Music and iCloud.  Nehal Chokshi, an analyst with Maxim Group, said that despite Ive\u2019s key role in Apple history, his departure will not hurt the iPhone maker.  FILE PHOTO: Apple CEO Tim Cook and Chief Design Officer Jonathan Ive (R) look over the new Mac Pro during Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California, U.S. June 3, 2019. REUTERS\/Mason Trinca  \u201cI would view it as Jony Ive looking to get paid market rates for his design expertise from Apple, with the right to allow other companies - not competitors to Apple - to leverage that expertise,\u201d Chokshi said.  CONTINUITY AFTER JOBS  Jobs deeply involved himself in Apple\u2019s design process, sometimes visiting Apple\u2019s design studios daily to offer Ive feedback. Chief Executive Tim Cook, to whom Ive now reports, has not done the same.  After Jobs\u2019 death, pundits questioned whether Apple could continue Jobs\u2019 pace of new products. Ive became a symbol of continuity, bridging the Jobs and Cook eras.  But Alan Cannistraro, chief executive of online video discovery platform Rheo who previously worked at Apple for a dozen years, said Apple employees knew Ive had taken on fewer day-to-day design duties in the past several years. Around 2015, Cannistraro would often see Ive at a high-end fitness gym on Market Street in San Francisco doing mid-morning workouts.  \u201cWhen I would see him there, two days a week or more, that just told me he had taken a step back,\u201d Cannistraro said.  Ive came to oversee both hardware and software design at Apple, but the company laid the groundwork for his departure over several years. During 2015, Ive handed off some duties to other executives while he finished Apple\u2019s new corporate headquarters, Apple Park.  One of those executives was Alan Dye, who Apple on Thursday said will become vice president of human interface design. The company appointed Evans Hankey as vice president of industrial design. Both have \u201cplayed key leadership roles\u201d in Apple\u2019s design team for years, the company said.  Cannistraro, the former Apple employee, said Hankey stood out as \u201cexceptional\u201d among Apple\u2019s already strong design teams. Around 2008, as Apple readied new iMacs, Hankey dug in on an idea to make Apple products talk to each other as a home control system.  The effort, which was never released, was not part of Hankey\u2019s official duties. But she took an interest anyway because of her \u201cvery long-term vision kind of role \u2013 looking for seeds that could turn into something bigger, or maybe plant some seeds, too,\u201d Cannistraro said.  The elevation of Dye and Hankey could reignite the connection between Apple\u2019s design teams and senior executives. Both will report to Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams, who will in turn hand off logistics and supply chain duties to Sabih Khan, newly named senior vice president of operations.  Meantime, Williams, who oversaw development of the Apple Watch, \u201cwill spend more of his time working with the design team in their studio,\u201d Apple said.  Williams has gained clout in Apple\u2019s product development process, but that does not necessarily mean he is poised to become chief executive in the near future, Maxim Group\u2019s Chokshi said.  \u201cI don\u2019t see Tim Cook retiring anytime soon,\u201d Chokshi said.","280":"July 8 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell at the open on Monday as Apple Inc shares dropped and investors scaled back bets of an aggressive interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve later this month following a solid June jobs report.

Apple often launches products and services in the weeks following an event.  In its invitation, Apple did not specify the focus of the event and gave a single-line description: \u201cIt\u2019s show time.\u201d  Apple has long hinted at a planned video service, spending $2 billion in Hollywood to produce its own content and signing major stars such as Oprah Winfrey.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The potential sales from a television service have become a focus of investors after Apple in January reported the first-ever dip in iPhone sales during the key holiday shopping period and said it would lower iPhone prices in some markets to account for foreign exchange rates.  Apple is also in discussions with HBO, part of AT&T Inc-owned WarnerMedia, to become part of the service and it could yet make it in time for the launch, according to a person familiar with the matter.  While there is a chance Apple will update its iPads or Apple TV devices later this month, the event is likely to be Apple\u2019s first major media event in which hardware is not the primary focus, said Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies.

REUTERS\/Edgar Su  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple\u2019s cash and services help salve iPhone worries. The $740 billion tech giant\u2019s holiday quarter was dismal, as foretold. A 5 percent sales drop shows Tim Cook\u2019s company can no longer expect to sell significantly more phones or jack up prices. Rising margins on extras sold to iPhone users and the promise of $130 billion of capital returns buys Apple time to refresh.  The iPhone has transformed Apple over the past dozen years, providing about 60 percent of revenue, but the smartphone market has matured. The number of units sold worldwide should grow less than 3 percent this year, estimates research outfit IDC.  Apple had resisted the trend by raising prices to sustain profit growth, but that game appears to be up. Revenue from the iPhone fell nearly 15 percent in the latest quarter from a year earlier even though the company charges prices almost 5 times as high as the average non-Apple smartphone, according to Sanford Bernstein. Apple pinned the latest sales slowdown predominantly on China, but it\u2019s more likely that was simply the first market where sticker shock hit hard.  A fast-growing services business provides some solace. Revenue from its app store, payments, online storage and the like accounted for 13 percent of all sales. Moreover, the margins are hefty at 63 percent, up nearly 5 percentage points from the same period last year. Both of these trends should continue as Apple sells more goods to users, and use its scale to reap a larger chunk of profit.  Yet investors appear skeptical that services can offset stalling hardware sales. Apple\u2019s stock has fallen by nearly a third since its October peak, erasing some $360 billion in market cap \u2013 more than all but the six most-valuable U.S. companies. The shares trade at just 12.5 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months, according to I\/B\/E\/S data from Refinitiv, compared with around 22 times for Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft.  Turning that valuation around will require evidence that Apple is making progress in new areas. Health initiatives such as using its devices to detect heart anomalies and advances in augmented reality are promising, but will take time to deliver. Apple\u2019s cash provides breathing room. It returned $13.1 billion to investors in the latest quarter, below its recent average, but its plan to eliminate that cash pile means plenty of buybacks ahead. That helps, but Apple needs to cook up new gadgets.","283":"Sept 11 (Reuters) - Apple Inc said on Friday it has revised its App Store guidelines ahead of the launch of an upcoming iOS version, with changes that may impact gaming and business apps on its platform.

FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc. logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, New York, U.S., October 16, 2019. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  The metal is being made by Elysis, a Montreal-based joint venture of Alcoa Corp and Rio Tinto announced last year with $144 million in funding from the two companies, Apple and the governments of Canada and Quebec.  The aluminum will be shipped this month from an Alcoa research facility in Pittsburgh and used in Apple products, although the technology company did not say which ones.  Aluminum is carbon-intensive to produce. The smelting process involves passing electrical current through a large block of carbon called an anode, which burns off during the process and releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.  The carbon-free move is a response to consumer, activist and investor demand that miners and manufacturers show they are working to lessen their impact on climate change.  \u201cFor more than 130 years, aluminum - a material common to so many products consumers use daily - has been produced the same way. That\u2019s about to change,\u201d Lisa Jackson, Apple\u2019s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, said in a statement.  Apple uses aluminum housings for many of its electronics, including iPhones, Apple Watches and Mac computers. Apple last year introduced Mac models that use recycled aluminum.  The Alcoa-Rio joint venture wants to commercialize a technology by 2024 that uses a ceramic anode to make aluminum and emits only oxygen, eliminating direct greenhouse gas emissions from the smelting process.  Alcoa has already produced test metal with the process and joined with Rio Tinto to bring it up to commercial scale. Elysis plans to license the technology and says that existing smelting facilities can be retrofitted to use it.  The first batch was made in Pittsburgh, but Elysis also plans to manufacture it at a $50 million CAD research facility being built in Saguenay, Quebec, and that is expected to come online in the second half of 2020.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - A must-have gadget has become a can-probably-wait. Apple\u2019s sales of iPhones fell 7% in the quarter ending March 28, and the fall in the following three months should be worse. That is both predictable, and self-limiting. Apple should bounce back.  It\u2019s no shocker that a product made in China, shipped around the world and purchased in currently-closed retail stores hasn\u2019t sold well during the coronavirus pandemic. The decline from iPhones was the main driver why Apple\u2019s revenue only grew 1%, year-on-year. But the mass boredom caused by widespread lockdowns benefits Tim Cook\u2019s firm in a different way. Service revenue jumped 17%, as customers spent more on apps, and Apple\u2019s gaming and music services. It accounted for 23% of all revenue in the quarter. It was about 20% of revenue during the same quarter last year.  Apple can\u2019t count on additional iPhone sales in the current quarter. This month\u2019s rollout of a $399 low-end iPhone might help, but as long as stores are shut and the smartphone market already saturated, demand may not rebound for several months \u2013 or quarters.  Compared with some tech rivals like Facebook and Alphabet-owned Google, Apple has a disadvantage: its reliance on revenue from China and on selling physical goods through retail outlets. Yet in another sense, Cook\u2019s firm is better off. After all, unplaced internet ads on Facebook are gone forever, whereas phone purchase are simply delayed. The release of 5G phones later this year will make users long to replace the iPhones they have.  That might explain why all three stocks have performed similarly, with only a slight fall in the year to date. True, that\u2019s still a comedown for a company that has delivered a total shareholder return triple that of the S&P 500 Index over the past five years.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  STORY: [.N]  COMMENTS:  RANDY FREDERICK, VICE PRESIDENT OF TRADING AND DERIVATIVES FOR CHARLES SCHWAB IN AUSTIN, TEXAS:  \u201cAt the end of the week on Friday, people were sort of taking risk off the table going into the weekend. That\u2019s not an uncommon thing especially when we had a pretty sharp rally earlier in the week after the midterm elections. And then we have what I call a \u201cpartial holiday\u201d today. So anytime you\u2019ve got a weekend plus an almost holiday weekend \u2013 although markets are open today the banks aren\u2019t \u2013 for people to take some risk off the table, especially after a bullish move in the market, is not uncommon. But I kind of thought we would have a bit of a bounce this morning and we didn\u2019t get that at all.  \u201cI think the bigger thing was the tech sector. Certainly it was a couple of stocks that do business with Apple talking about lower orders and concerns about that. And Apple itself is down a lot. It\u2019s a big bellwether in many indexes and it\u2019s considered a bellwether for the whole tech industry and I think that just kind of sparked some panic across several tech sectors including semiconductors... The thing about tech is that it\u2019s the biggest sector in the market \u2013 it\u2019s 21 percent of the overall market, which is huge. But also these guys have been an outperformer for a good part of this year and, in fact, not just this year but for several years. So they tend to be highly volatile. When they lead to the upside they also tend to lead to the downside, and so when there becomes some concern about that, people get a little uncertain, a little scared and they start selling them off.\u201d  CHUCK CARLSON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT HORIZON INVESTMENT SERVICES IN HAMMOND, INDIANA  \u201cLooks like we\u2019ve gone through the bulk of the earnings season so now the market\u2019s attention is going to be focused on non-earnings -related things. And today\u2019s trading may be a bit exacerbated by the holiday and volumes may be a bit lower. But a couple of things are going on.  \u201cOne, you continue to see the adjustment in market leadership, today that was really accelerated with money continuing to move out of the high-growth tech area, spurred by reports that Apple\u2019s smartphone business may be slowing. Money is shifting from there into risk-off assets, utilities, defensive stocks, dividend payers. That\u2019s an adjustment that had been occurring for some time, but there seems to be an acceleration today.  \u201cCouple that with concerns about the dollar\u2019s strength and what that might mean for corporate profits going forward. The biggest issue is the market continuing to grapple with what appears to be a pendulum swing back toward value, dividend-paying stocks, risk-off assets versus where we were early in the year which was growth, growth, growth. When you have significant shifts like that you have tons of money that\u2019s flopping around out there, it can result in days like this where you have these kinds of adjustments going on.  \u201cCertainly volume will impact the thinner market and that can accentuate moves. That is a factor that may be exacerbating the decline today, you probably have a lower participant market today. Tomorrow it will be interesting to see if people are willing to step in and buy the two day dip. When the bond market opens along with the stocks, maybe the stock market took all of the selling today. If people are in a selling mood they\u2019re going to sell what they can sell. Today the only thing they could sell were stocks. Tomorrow is going to be pretty telling in terms of how significant this one-day trading activity was.\u201d  PETER JANKOVSKIS, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT OAKBROOK INVESTMENTS LLC IN LISLE, ILLINOIS:  \u201cI would say at the moment it seems the path of least resistance is down. Obvious the techs are dragging on the market pretty heavily. We have also seen energy, perhaps joining in a little bit more as we get closer to the close because we have seen oil up earlier in the day and now it has turned negative.  \u201cMost of the other stuff has been out there, tech has been down all day, industrials with GE have been weighing all day, that is the biggest change I can see. (Goldman Sachs) is certainly hitting the financials, although the financials as a whole are kind of in line with the market overall.  \u201cYou just have to wait and see, realistically we are getting to the point where things are a little overdone on this but it sometimes takes a while for the market to come to that same conclusion.\u201d  RANDY FREDERICK, VICE PRESIDENT OF TRADING AND DERIVATIVES FOR CHARLES SCHWAB IN AUSTIN  \u201cI think it\u2019s just Apple. It\u2019s such a big company and such a bellwether for all things tech. The tech sector has been a leader year-to-date and it\u2019s a high beta sector, it starts to become a bigger drag on the way down.  \u201cIt seems a bit overdone to me. There is obviously some volatility in the oil markets and the dollar is up a little bit, but this kind of a selloff is pretty substantial. It seems to be fairly widespread.

FILE PHOTO: Customers walk past an Apple logo inside of an Apple store at Grand Central Station in New York, U.S., August 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  That commission is a key issue in a closely watched antitrust case that will reach the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday. The nine justices will hear arguments in Apple\u2019s bid to escape damages in a lawsuit accusing it of breaking federal antitrust laws by monopolizing the market for iPhone apps and causing consumers to pay more than they should.  The justices will ultimately decide a broader question: Can consumers even sue for damages in an antitrust case like this one?  Apple, which is appealing a lower court decision that revived the proposed consumer class-action lawsuit, says no, citing a decades-old Supreme Court precedent. The Cupertino, California-based technology company said that siding with the iPhone users who filed the lawsuit would threaten the burgeoning field of e-commerce, which generates hundreds of billions of dollars annually in U.S. retail sales.  The plaintiffs, as well as antitrust watchdog groups, said that if the justices close courthouse doors to those who buy consumer products, monopolistic conduct could expand unchecked.  \u201cA lot of tech platforms will start making the argument that consumers don\u2019t have standing to bring antitrust suits against us,\u201d said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director for the Open Markets Institute, a Washington-based antitrust advocacy group.  \u201cUber could say, we\u2019re just providing communication services to ride-sharing drivers,\u201d Vaheesan said, referring to the popular ride-sharing company. \u201cIf there\u2019s an antitrust issue, the drivers can bring a claim but passengers do not have standing.\u201d  The iPhone users accused Apple of violating federal antitrust law by monopolizing the sale of paid apps, leading to inflated prices compared to if apps were available from other sources.  Though developers set the prices of their apps, Apple collects the payments from iPhone users, keeping a 30 percent commission on each purchase. One area of dispute in the case is whether app developers recoup the cost of that commission by passing it on to consumers. Developers earned more than $26 billion in 2017, a 30 percent increase over 2016, according to Apple.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The company sought to have the antitrust claims dismissed, saying the plaintiffs lacked the required legal standing to bring the lawsuit.  Apple has seized upon a 1977 Supreme Court ruling that limited damages for anti-competitive conduct to those directly overcharged instead of indirect victims who paid an overcharge passed on by others. Part of the concern, the court said in that case, was to free judges from having to make complex calculations of damages.  Apple said it is acting only as the agent for app developers who sell the apps to consumers through the App Store.  The company said allowing the lawsuit to proceed would be dangerous for the e-commerce industry, which increasingly relies on agent-based sales models. Apple cited companies like ticket site StubHub, Amazon\u2019s Marketplace and eBay.  Lawsuits against companies like these would multiply \u201cand lead to the quagmire this court sought to avoid,\u201d Apple told the justices in a legal brief.  E-commerce reached $452 billion in U.S. retail sales in 2017, according to U.S. government estimates.  Apple is supported by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. The plaintiffs are backed by the attorneys general of 30 states including California, Texas, Florida and New York.  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce business group, backing Apple, said in a brief to the justices, \u201cThe increased risk and cost of litigation will chill innovation, discourage commerce, and hurt developers, retailers and consumers alike.\u201d  The plaintiffs and some anti-monopoly groups disagree. They said that app developers would be unlikely to sue because they would not want to bite the hand that feeds them, leaving no one to challenge anti-competitive conduct.  Developers \u201ccannot risk the possibility of Apple removing them from the App Store if they bring suit,\u201d the American Antitrust Institute advocacy group said in a brief.  Apple is \u201ctrying to make it harder for injured parties to assert their rights under federal antitrust law,\u201d said Mark Rifkin, an attorney for the plaintiffs.  The claims against Apple date to 2011 when several iPhone buyers including lead plaintiff Robert Pepper of Chicago filed a class action lawsuit against Apple in federal court in Oakland, California. A judge initially threw out the suit, ruling that the consumers were not direct purchasers because the higher fees they paid were passed on to them by the developers.  The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year revived the lawsuit, deciding that Apple was a distributor that sold iPhone apps directly to consumers.","300":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O has cut production orders in recent weeks for all three iPhone models launched in September, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing sources.  A lower-than-expected demand for the new iPhones and Apple's decision to offer more models has made it difficult to anticipate the number of components and handsets the company needs, according to the WSJ report here.  Apple shocked investors a few weeks ago with a sales forecast for the Christmas quarter below Wall Street expectations, prompting certain suppliers to issue warnings that pointed to weakness in new iPhone sales.  Screen maker Japan Display Inc 6740.T cut its full-year outlook citing weaker smartphone demand, while British chipmaker IQE Plc IQE.L said it expects a material reduction in its financial performance in the current year.  Lumentum Holdings Inc LITE.O, AMS AG AMS.S, companies which supply Apple with software needed for its FaceID technology, also lowered their forecasts.  Another supplier Analog Devices Inc ADI.O is expected to report fourth-quarter results before markets open on Tuesday.  Apple shares were down 3.7 percent at $186.38 on Monday, while Lumentum, Skyworks Solutions Inc SWKS.O and Qorvo Inc QRVO.O were down between 2.7 to 6 percent.  Forecasts have been particularly problematic for iPhone XR with Apple cutting its production plan by up to a third of the nearly 70 million units some suppliers had been asked to produce between September and February, WSJ reported.  As recently as last week, Apple informed several suppliers that it had lowered its production plan again for iPhone XR, the Journal said.  The company started selling its latest generation of phones, the iPhone XS and XS Max, in September and the XR model in October.  Analysts at Cowen & Co expect a modest hit from iPhone production cuts on memory chipmakers like Western Digital Corp WDC.O and Micron Technology Inc MU.O.  The brokerage forecast a 10 cent headwind to Micron and 15 cent headwind to Western Digital in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 on lower iPhone builds.

One billion dollars will go to a jointly run fund with state officials aimed at jumpstarting delayed or stalled affordable housing projects. Another $1 billion will go to a state-run fund to provide first-time home buyer financial assistance to teachers, nurses and first responders such as police and firefighters, among others.  In an interview with Reuters, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said the company felt a \u201cprofound responsibility\u201d to improve California\u2019s housing crisis. Apple\u2019s current headquarters - a ring of gleaming metal and glass nicknamed the \u201cspaceship\u201d in Cupertino, California - sits less than five miles from the suburban family home where co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak assembled the first Apple computers in the 1970s.  \u201cWe want to make sure that it is a vibrant place where people can live and also raise a family,\u201d Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters in an interview. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no question that today that isn\u2019t possible for many people, that the region suffers from an affordability crisis that is existential.\u201d  The move comes after Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc-owned Google both committed $1 billion toward California housing initiatives while Microsoft Corp committed $500 million in the Seattle, Washington area.  Apple said the project-financing fund was the first of its kind. Real estate developers often secure bonds for affordable housing development but must service the debt during construction until the houses are built and start to generate revenue. Apple and state officials hope to provide bridge financing during construction at rates below those from commercial lenders.  Apple said the funding could take two years to deploy but that it hopes to recycle the funding for future projects over five years.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  \u201cThis unparalleled financial commitment to affordable housing, and the innovative strategies at the heart of this initiative, are proof that Apple is serious about solving this issue,\u201d California Governor Gavin Newsom said in a statement.

Apple said it was unlikely to meet the March quarter sales guidance it had set just three weeks ago. HSBC Holdings PLC also warned about the impact of the coronavirus on its Asia business. \u201cWith Apple coming out and missing sales just on the coronavirus, it continued the risk-off tone on growth concerns,\u201d said Justin Lederer, an interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. German economic data also showed the virus weighing on sentiment. The mood among German investors deteriorated far more than expected in February on worries that the coronavirus outbreak would dampen world trade. The latest data provided by China on people infected with coronavirus indicates a decline in new cases but \"every scenario is still on the table\" in terms of the epidemic's evolution, the World Health Organization said on Monday.

They earlier fell to 1.98%, the lowest since Sept. 5, and are approaching a record low of 1.905% set on Aug. 28. A global thirst for yield and expectations that inflation will remain tepid has increased demand for longer-dated U.S. debt and driven the U.S. yield curve flatter.

The deal with a coalition led by Arizona, Arkansas and Indiana is separate from a proposed settlement Apple reached in March to pay affected iPhone owners up to $500 million to stem a class action.  Apple in 2016 quietly updated software on models of the iPhone 6, 7 and SE to throttle chip speeds so that aging batteries on the devices would not send power spikes to the phone\u2019s processor and cause it to unexpectedly shut down. States contended Apple acted deceptively and should have replaced batteries or disclosed the issue.  Millions of users were affected by power shutoffs, according to an Arizona court filing.  \u201cMy colleagues and I are trying to get the attention of these big tech companies, and you would hope a multimillion-dollar judgment with more than 30 states will get their attention,\u201d Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said in an interview.  \u201cCompanies cannot be disingenuous and conceal things,\u201d he added.  Apple, which has denied wrongdoing, could not immediately be reached for comment.  Apple also agreed for the next three years to provide \u201ctruthful information\u201d about iPhone power management across its website, software update notes and iPhone settings. Arizona said Apple\u2019s present disclosures and options are sufficient. The settlement with states is subject to court approval.  The multistate investigation into Apple, which Reuters first reported in July, is part of a wave of probes into the world\u2019s biggest technology providers.  Republican attorneys general in 11 U.S. states last month joined the U.S. Justice Department in an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, and large, bipartisan groups of attorneys general have ongoing investigations into Google and Facebook Inc over potentially deceptive and anticompetitive practices.  Apple acknowledged its update reduced power demands after researchers found unusual slowdowns in 2017. The company publicly apologized and slashed prices on battery replacements.  The settlement includes $5 million to Arizona, $24.6 million to Apple\u2019s home state of California and $7.6 million to Texas. The latter two states have the nation\u2019s Nos. 1 and 2 affected iPhone user bases. Brnovich said the penalty in his state would help fund more investigations into tech and other companies.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  The response comes after China Labor Watch on Monday issued a lengthy report accusing the two companies of breaching numerous Chinese labor laws, including one barring temporary staff from exceeding 10% of the total workforce.  U.S. tech firm Apple relies heavily on Taiwan\u2019s Foxconn and its Chinese manufacturing facilities to produce devices such as the iPhone, the next line of which will be unveiled on Tuesday.  In a statement, Apple said it investigated the percentage of temporary workers among the overall workforce and found it \u201cexceeded our standards\u201d. It said it was working with Foxconn to \u201cimmediately resolve the issue\u201d.  Apple did not state whether the excess amounted to a breach of Chinese law. It declined to comment when asked directly by Reuters.  China\u2019s Ministry of Human Resources and Security did not respond to a Reuters fax seeking comment. Reuters could not immediately determine any penalty for temporary employees exceeding 10% of the workforce.  Apple also said it discovered interns at a supplier facility had worked overtime at night, violating company policy, and that \u201cthis issue has been corrected.\u201d It said the interns worked overtime voluntarily and were properly compensated.  Foxconn separately confirmed over-reliance on temporary workers, known internally as dispatch workers.  \u201cWe did find evidence that the use of dispatch workers and the number of hours of overtime work carried out by employees, which we have confirmed was always voluntary, was not consistent with company guidelines,\u201d Foxconn said.  It said it \u201cimmediately began a detailed process to ensure that all issues were addressed\u201d.  The labor report comes at a time of trade tension between the United States and China that has threatened to upend supply chains across the technology industry with tit-for-tat import tariffs.  Earlier this year, media reports said Apple was considering moving some operations out of China to avoid new U.S. tariffs, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei Asian Review in June putting the figure at 15% to 30% of production.  In an earnings call in July, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook downplayed such speculation, stating the vast majority of Apple\u2019s products \u201care kind of made everywhere.\u201d  \u201cThere\u2019s a significant level of content from the United States and a lot from Japan to Korea to China, and the European Union also contributes a fair amount.

FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc. logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, New York, U.S., October 16, 2019. REUTERS\/Mike Segar  While China, which accounts for roughly 15% of Apple\u2019s revenue, appears to be a rare bright spot, investors will be keen to get a picture of global demand when the Cupertino, California-headquartered company reports second-quarter results on Thursday.  The iPhone maker has shut retail stores in the United States and Europe following the COVID-19 outbreak, and China is the only major market where it has been able to reopen all shops.  Consumer spending is expected to be muted as the pandemic has crippled economies and Apple, the world\u2019s second-most valuable tech company, is better armed with the launch of its new price-conscious iPhone model, analysts said.  \u201cApple is better positioned than most to experience a rapid recovery in a post COVID world,\u201d Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani said in a research note. \u201cWe see demand as pushed out, not canceled.\u201d  He added that the launch of the $399 iPhone SE suggested that Apple\u2019s supply chain was getting back on its feet after weeks of shutdown earlier this year.  Analysts expect Apple to report a 6% drop in revenue and an 11% fall in net income in its fiscal second quarter, according to Refinitiv data.  On the other hand, Chinese brands such as Oppo and Vivo who have steadily moved to offer high-end models to challenge iPhones, stand to lose marketshare as bargain hunters choose Apple.  Earlier this month, several online retailers in China slashed prices of the iPhone 11 by as much as 18% - a tactic Apple has used in the past to boost demand. And while initial social media reaction to the new iPhone SE was muted, analysts said they were seeing a pick up in demand.  The cheaper iPhone SE could tempt iPhone owners to opt for a newer device, something they might have otherwise delayed in a weak economy, said Nicole Peng, who tracks the smartphone sector at research firm Canalys.  \u201cPeople want to avoid uncertainty in a downturn,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving a brand like Apple that can showcase quality and make people less worried about breakdowns or after-sales service can bring in buyers.\u201d  CHEAP IS GOOD  Early data suggests that the Chinese smartphone market is recovering rapidly in the aftermath of the virus, and Apple has emerged relatively unscathed.  Sales of iPhones in China jumped 21% last month from a year earlier and more than three fold from February, government data showed, meaning March-quarter sales in the country were likely to have slipped just 1%.  To be sure, a recovery in Chinese demand won\u2019t offset sales lost in the United States and Europe. And the company is yet to launch a smartphone enabled with 5G wireless technology like those offered by Asian rivals, a disadvantage for Apple so far.  But those same expensive 5G models may not sell well in the current climate of frugality, analysts said.  \u201cIf there are no massive subsidies (in China), I doubt there will be many smartphone users who will be eager to upgrade to 5G,\u201d said Linda Sui, who tracks the smartphone sector at research firm Strategy Analytics.  Sui expects iPhone shipments in 2020 to be down 2 percentage points at the most, versus double digit declines at Chinese firms.  Apple also has revenue from its services business to fall back on. It has leveraged its large iPhone customer base to boost services revenue from music, apps, gaming and video.  \u201cApple\u2019s Services segment should remain resilient in today\u2019s work-from-home environment, thereby demonstrating the durability of Apple\u2019s model,\u201d Cowen analyst Krish Sankar said.","313":"FILE PHOTO: Japan Display Inc's logo is pictured at its headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, August 9, 2016.

The rapidly spreading virus has killed nearly 1,900 in China and stricken some 72,000 people, confining millions to their homes, disrupting supply chains and delaying reopening of factories after the extended Lunar New Year holiday break.  Manufacturing facilities in China that produce Apple\u2019s iPhone and other electronics have begun to reopen, but they are ramping up more slowly than expected, Apple said. That will mean fewer iPhones available for sale around the world, making Apple one of the largest Western firms to be hurt by the outbreak.  Some of its retail stores in the country remain closed or are operating at reduced hours, which will hurt sales this quarter. China accounted for 15% of Apple\u2019s revenue, or $13.6 billion, last quarter, and supplied 18% of revenue in the year-ago quarter.  In late January, Apple had forecast $63 billion to $67 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in March, which it said was a wider than normal range due to the uncertainty created by the virus. It did not offer a new revenue estimate nor provide a profit forecast on Monday.  \u201cThe magnitude of this impact to miss its revenue guidance midway through February is clearly worse than feared,\u201d Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note.  Apple, worth $1.4 trillion by market capitalization, could face a torrid market reaction on Tuesday, when Wall Street reopens after the Presidents Day holiday, analysts said.  \u201cIf Apple shares were traded cheaply, that might not matter much. But when they are trading at a record high, investors will be surely tempted to sell,\u201d said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.

FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc. logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, New York, U.S., October 16, 2019. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  Analysts have estimated that the virus may slash demand for smartphones by half in the first quarter in China, the world\u2019s biggest market for the devices.  SHORT-TERM IMPACT?  Apple said it will reopen China stores \u201cas steadily and safely as we can,\u201d while global supplies of iPhones will be limited as manufacturers work toward operating plants at full capacity. It plans to provide more information in April, when it releases first-quarter results.  Wedbush said it remained optimistic that Apple would be able to recover from the coronavirus setback.  \u201cWhile trying to gauge the impact of the iPhone miss and potential bounce back in the June quarter will be front and center for the Street, we remain bullish on Apple for the longer term,\u201d Ives said.  The disruption follows a strong December quarter for iPhone sales, which were up for the first time in a year. That could provide an opening for mobile phone rival Samsung, which has invested in manufacturing capacity in Vietnam and elsewhere.  Samsung launched smartphone delivery services for customers to test its new products this week, as the spread of the virus has prompted the South Korean firm to cancel promotional events and brace for weak store sales.  Apple's contract manufacturers have added far more locations inside China than outside, with major supplier Foxconn 2317.TW expanding from 19 locations in 2015 to 29 in 2019 and another supplier, Pegatron Corp 4938.TW, going from eight to 12 locations, according to data from Apple.  In contrast, Samsung had signaled early in the U.S.-China trade war that it could meet U.S mobile phone demand without China production. Samsung is also far less exposed to China as an end market.  Fiat Chrysler, FCHA.MI, Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS and General Motors Co GM.N have said their auto production lines were, or could be, hit by Chinese factories that are slow to restart because of the virus.","322":"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.N removed 29,800 apps from its Chinese app store on Saturday, including more than 26,000 games, according to data from research firm Qimai.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  The takedowns come amid a crackdown on unlicensed games by Chinese authorities.  Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Earlier this year Apple gave game publishers an end-of-June deadline to submit a government-issued licence number enabling users to make in-app purchases.  China\u2019s Android app stores have long complied with those regulations. It is not clear why Apple is enforcing them strictly this year.  The smartphone maker removed more than 2,500 titles from its app store over the first week of July. Games affected by the sweep included titles from Zynga and Supercell, research firm SensorTower reported at the time.  The Chinese government has long sought to enforce stricter regulations on its gaming industry to remove sensitive content.  The approval process for games looking to enable in-app purchases is long and complicated, hurting all but the largest game developers, industry insiders say.  \u201cThis affects small- and mid-sized developers\u2019 incomes the most, but due to the difficulties of acquiring a business licence, it\u2019s devastating to the whole iOS game industry in China,\u201d said Todd Kuhns, marketing manager for AppInChina, a firm that helps overseas companies distribute their apps.

The stakes are high for the European Commission in its crackdown against what it sees as aggressive tax planning by multinationals.  It has a mixed record to date, winning court backing in its case against Fiat Chrysler but losing in the Starbucks and Belgian tax break cases.  The Commission is appealing to the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union following a ruling last year by the General Court, which said the EU executive had not met the requisite legal standard to show Apple had enjoyed an unfair advantage.  In its 2016 finding the Commission said two Irish tax rulings had artificially reduced Apple\u2019s tax burden for over two decades, which in 2014 was as low as 0.005%.  \u201cThe General Court\u2019s failure to properly consider the structure and content of the decision and the explanations in the Commission\u2019s written submissions on the functions performed by the head offices and the Irish branches is a breach of procedure,\u201d the Commission said in a filing in the Official Journal,  The EU competition enforcer added: \u201cThe General Court\u2019s subsequent acknowledgement... that the decision examines the functions performed by the Irish branches in justifying the attribution of the Apple IP licences to them constitutes contradictory reasoning, which amounts to a failure to state reasons.\u201d  Apple has said the General Court judgment proved it has always complied with Irish laws, with the issue more about where it should pay taxes rather than the amount.  The CJEU will hold a hearing on the case in the coming months. The case is C-465\/20 P Commission v Ireland and Others.","324":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc will ask developers to position a new \u201cSign on with Apple\u201d button in iPhone and iPad apps above rival buttons from Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Facebook Inc, according to design guidelines released this week.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Apple is seen at a store in Zurich, Switzerland January 3, 2019. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  The move to give Apple prime placement is significant because users often select the default or top option on apps. And Apple will require apps to offer its button if they want to offer options to login with Facebook or Google.  Apple unveiled its login button on Monday, emphasizing users\u2019 privacy and also introducing a feature that randomly generates an email address to avoid revealing the person\u2019s true email.  Many consumers choose to sign in to independent apps using their accounts from Google or Facebook because it saves the trouble of having to create and remember separate user names and passwords for dozens of different apps.  But the login buttons can send some data back to their makers about the user\u2019s app habits. Apple\u2019s software chief Craig Federighi said during a keynote address on Monday that Apple was seeking to give users a more private option and developers a way to offer a fast one-step login without sending their user\u2019s data to another company.  In a press release about updates to its App Store review guidelines, Apple said its login button \u201cwill be required as an option for users in apps that support third-party sign-in when it is commercially available later this year.\u201d  Apple\u2019s guidelines do not appear to impose requirements on apps that have their own dedicated login system and do not use third-party buttons from Google or Facebook, such as apps from game maker Nintendo Co Ltd. Apple\u2019s button also works on websites. Its use will not be required because Apple does not hold review power over websites the way it does apps on its own store, but Apple\u2019s guidelines still ask it to be given top placement if it is used.  Apple declined to comment further beyond its executives\u2019 public remarks on Sign in with Apple. Facebook and Google declined to comment on the move, though Google said it does not require use of Google\u2019s login button for apps in its Play Store on Android devices.  Apple\u2019s suggestion to developers to place its login button above rival buttons is part of its \u201cHuman Interface Guidelines,\u201d which are not formal requirements to pass App Store review. But many developers believe that following them is the surest way to gain approval.  Apple\u2019s guidelines to developers around login tools come as developers and rivals have alleged that some of its App Store practices, such as taking a commission of up to 30% of sales made through the store, are anticompetitive.  United States antitrust regulators are also laying the ground for a potential antitrust review of Apple and other major technology companies, Reuters reported Monday. In an interview with CBS News that aired on Tuesday, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said it was \u201cfair\u201d for regulators to scrutinize Apple given its size but said the company is not a monopoly in any of the markets it operates in.","325":"Oct 12 (Reuters) - On Tuesday, Apple Inc will broadcast an event from its Cupertino, California campus and is widely expected to announce new iPhones that can tap 5G wireless data networks.  Apple teased the event\u2019s announcement with the tagline \u201cHi, speed,\u201d a possible allusion to the far faster speeds that some variations of 5G can deliver.  Apple is far from the first phone maker to launch 5G phones. Indeed, nearly all of its rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd have 5G models on store shelves already. Apple\u2019s entrance to the fray is likely to bring fresh attention to the technology, even if U.S. carriers are still years away from rolling out the fastest versions.  Here\u2019s a closer look at what analysts expect Apple to announce.  A FLAGSHIP IPHONE FOR PROS  Starting with last year\u2019s iPhone models, Apple forked its iPhone 11 flagship devices into a \u201cPro\u201d variant that packed more cameras and an upgraded screen starting at a $1,000 while the standard flagship cost $700. Analysts expect a similar split this year, with two iPhone \u201cPro\u201d models, one of which could feature a larger screen than last year\u2019s largest \u201cMax\u201d model. Some analysts expect a 3D camera to assist with features like augmented reality, similar to a sensor that Apple put into some iPad models earlier this year. Both iPhone Pro models are likely to have 5G features.  A FLAGSHIP IPHONE FOR EVERYONE ELSE  As with the previous year, analysts expect a plain iPhone 12 model that will likely have cheaper screen technology and fewer cameras, but otherwise retain features from the top-of-the-line model such as new same \u201cA14\u201d processor chips. Look for this model to come in only one size, arrive in the middle of Apple\u2019s pricing range and be the phone Apple promotes as the right choice for most users.  POCKETS OF THE WORLD, REJOICE  Apple\u2019s iPhones have steadily grown in size since their debut in 2007, and the most recent flagships can strain even the roomiest pants pockets. Fans of phones that can be comfortably used with one hand are stuck with Apple\u2019s iPhone SE, whose design harkens back to the 2014 iPhone 6 despite having a newer processor chip.  Analysts this year expect Apple to show a smaller version of its flagship - perhaps called the iPhone 12 Mini - that will have features such as a screen with far smaller bezel but in form factor closer to the iPhone SE.  This model is likely to be Apple\u2019s lowest price flagship, but a major question is whether it will support the fastest variant of 5G called millimeter wave. Millimeter wave technology requires new radio chips that drive up the cost of phones - some Android phones with the feature cost more than their other 5G cousins - and take up space inside the phone.  A SMALLER HOMEPOD  Apple was a late comer to the smart speaker market, launching its HomePod in early 2018, well after rivals Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google had come to dominate the market. Apple has not released an update to the HomePod since then, but analysts expect a smaller, cheaper speaker, possibly called the HomePod Mini, though it is unclear whether Apple will match the $40 price tag for some of Amazon and Google\u2019s smallest speakers. (Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)","326":"(Reuters) - First Apple Inc AAPL.O took away the headphone jack on its iPhones. Then it took away the home button.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  And now, it has taken away a closely watched performance metric that it has disclosed to investors for 20 years.  The Cupertino, California-based company on Thursday said that it will stop reporting unit sales data for its iPhone, iPad and Mac computer products, the latter of which it has given out since 1998. Analysts and investors use the figures to calculate the average selling price of Apple\u2019s devices and gauge the health of the company.  Apple said the data is less relevant to the strength of its business as customers bundle products, such as an iPhone paired with its wireless AirPods headphones, along with paid subscription services like Apple Music to listen to songs and iCloud storage for photos. Analysts were skeptical.  \u201cCompanies typically stop reporting metrics when the metrics are about to turn. This is not a good look for Apple,\u201d said analyst Walter Piecyk from BTIG Research.  The move cost Apple dearly, helping to send shares down about 7 percent in after-hours trading. They later settled at $207.81, about 6.5 percent below their previous close.  \u201cApple is a complex company with lot of moving parts,\u201d said analyst Ivan Fienseth from Tigress \u201cI think they need to give more transparency to their shareholders and not less.\u201d  But now, Apple will give cost-of-sales data for both its total product businesses and its total services business, which will let investors evaluate a gross margin for both. In the past, Apple gave only an overall gross margin figure for the company.  The new numbers are important for two reasons. First, they will show just how lucrative Apple\u2019s hardware business really is. But more importantly, for the first time they give margin information on Apple\u2019s services business, which reached $10 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter, up 17 percent.  Many of Apple's fastest-growing businesses are subscription based, like its $9.99 a month Apple Music service. And investors tend to value subscription business through a combination of their revenue growth rate and margins - information that Apple investors will now have, said Tien Tzuo, chief executive of Zuora Inc ZUO.N, a company that helps subscription businesses track their finances.  But one problem Apple investors will face is not knowing what the margin mix is within the services business. Some parts of it, like iCloud storage, are likely lucrative, but others, like Apple Music, are probably less so because Apple has to pay music licenses costs and competes with rival Spotify Technology SA SPOT.N.  \u201cYou would value the music business with one (revenue) multiple closer to Spotify, and the cloud business with a (subscription software) multiple,\u201d said Tzuo. \u201cHaving some sense of which business is growing faster would be nice.\u201d","327":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tile Inc, which helps users find lost items, told a congressional panel on Wednesday that Apple failed to live up to promises aimed at resolving a dispute between the two companies and introduced requirements that would hurt their business.  The smart-tracker maker was one of four companies that testified against the big tech platforms - Tile focused on Apple - in a January hearing in Colorado of a panel of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee.  At the time, Tile\u2019s General Counsel Kirsten Daru said that the company had initially had a mutually beneficial relationship with Apple which deteriorated last year amid signs that Apple planned to bring out a similar product.  \u201cUnfortunately, since that hearing, Apple\u2019s anti-competitive behaviors have gotten worse, not better,\u201d Tile said in a statement to the committee posted online on Wednesday.  Tile had objected to Apple requiring its users to repeatedly agree to allow Tile to operate in the background, which is crucial to Tile\u2019s service. Without background location access, Tile\u2019s app can only detect when a user loses keys or a wallet if they happen to lose it while the app is open.  \u201cDespite Apple\u2019s multiple promises to reinstate \u2018Always Allow\u2019 background permissions option for third party apps\u2019 geolocation services, Apple has not yet done so,\u201d Tile said.  Tile also said that there were indications that Apple planned to update its Find My product, adding hardware, so it would be a competitor to Tile.  Apple declined comment but pointed to a response it made to the committee in February which said that iOS 13 was aimed at strengthening privacy practices by reminding users that a third-party app is potentially using their location data.  Apple\u2019s Find My app enables background location tracking, Tile said, without these reminders.  Reuters reported in February that the U.S. Justice Department has reached out to app developers as part of its investigation into Apple.  The committee is one of several investigations underway into the big tech platforms, which also include Alphabet\u2019s Google, Facebook and Amazon. The investigations are being carried out by the U.S. Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and two groups of attorneys general from dozens of states.","328":"(Reuters) - Major Japanese wireless carriers are planning to cut the price of Apple Inc\u2019s iPhone XR as early as next week, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.  The iPhone maker will offer subsidies to mobile network operators in Japan to boost the sales of iPhone XR, the Journal reported.  Apple did not respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.  Earlier this week, the WSJ reported that Apple had cut production orders in recent weeks for all three iPhone models launched in September.  Apple shocked investors a few weeks ago with a sales forecast for the Christmas quarter below Wall Street expectations, prompting certain suppliers to issue warnings that pointed to weakness in new iPhone sales.  The company started selling its latest generation of phones, the iPhone XS and XS Max, in September and the XR model in October.","329":"(Corrects to show Foxconn is Taiwanese company, paragraph 17)  SEOUL, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics stands to be a major beneficiary of the China production problems announced by rival Apple Inc on Monday, reaping the rewards of a decade-long bet on low-cost smartphone manufacturing in Vietnam.  Half of Samsung\u2019s smartphones are now made in Vietnam, where the coronavirus that has crippled the China operations of Apple and many other firms has so far had only a limited impact on its production.  Apple said on Monday it would not meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to the coronavirus impact on both production and sales in China, where most iPhones are made. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp last week also flagged a hit to its March quarter sales.  Huawei, another major Samsung rival, has not announced any production problems, but Samsung insiders, analysts and suppliers expect it will also be hit hard due to its heavy reliance on Chinese manufacturing and parts. Many Chinese and foreign firms have begun to re-open China factories that were idled for weeks, but shortages of workers and other problems have in many cases kept output to a minimum.  Samsung has also largely ceded the China market to its rivals in recent years, meaning it won\u2019t suffer from the store closures and drop in demand that is hitting Apple and others.  \u201cSamsung is better positioned to weather the virus fallout than its formidable rivals such as Huawei and Apple,\u201d a person with knowledge of Samsung\u2019s supply chain told Reuters.  \u201cThe virus exposed China risks. We feel fortunate that we were able to escape the risks,\u201d he said.  Another person familiar with Samsung\u2019s thinking told Reuters: \u201cSamsung does not say it publicly. But it is relieved.\u201d  Still, two sources familiar with Samsung\u2019s Vietnam operations cautioned that should the virus outbreak be prolonged, Samsung would feel the impact, as the company sources many components from China.  Problems with cross-border shipments also cropped up in the early phases of the virus outbreak as Vietnam imposed stricter border controls, according to Hong Sun, vice chairman of Korea Chamber of Business in Vietnam. The issues have since been resolved, Sun said, but risks remain if Chinese parts suppliers cannot get back to work.  Samsung also relies on Chinese contract manufacturers for some low-end models.  In a statement to Reuters, the company said: \u201cWe are making our best effort to minimize any impact on our operations.\u201d  TrendForce recently cut its first quarter production forecasts for Huawei by 15% and Apple by 10%. It cut projections for Samsung Electronics by a smaller 3%.  Before the virus, the global smartphone market had been expected to end two consecutive years of falls, driven by smartphones running on faster 5G wireless networks. But the virus outbreak will throw cold water on any rebound, with global shipments likely to record another decline.  Since starting phone production in Vietnam in 2009, Samsung has aggressively boosted output through cheaper labor and generous government incentives. A number of South Korean suppliers followed suit, powering its breakneck growth.  Samsung ended its own smartphone production in China last year as its market share plunged to nearly zero.  Apple makes most of its iPhones in China via Taiwanese company Foxconn. Manufacturing facilities there that produce Apple\u2019s iPhone and other electronics have begun to reopen, but they are ramping up more slowly than expected, Apple said on Monday.  Last week, Samsung unveiled a trio of flagship Galaxy s20 smartphones as well as its new foldable phone. Sources said the virus could delay new product launches by rivals.

It has also jumped in app rankings for other countries.  \u201cThis situation is completely out of our control,\u201d UK-based developer and publisher Ndemic Creations said in a statement, adding its immediate priority was to make contact with the Cyberspace Administration of China to understand its concerns and work towards a resolution.  The regulator did not respond to Reuters phone calls and faxes requesting comment on the matter. Apple Inc and Ndemic did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.  China has stringent rules on content from video games to movies to music and censors anything it believes violates core socialist values. Gaming companies must also seek licenses for the games they want to publish.  Although there was a brief window when public criticism of authorities\u2019 handling of the outbreak was allowed, censors have tightened their grip in recent weeks. WeChat groups and podcasts have been shut down while social media posts and articles have been deleted.  \u201cThe game may have simply been taken down due to sensitivities around the topic and gameplay of the title given the recent COVID-19 outbreak,\u201d said Daniel Ahmad, an analyst with gaming research firm Niko Partners.  He added that it might be related to a new feature in the game which allows players to create \u201cfake news\u201d stories about the virus, noting other epidemic-related games albeit ones with some educational content were still available in China.  He said he didn\u2019t think the game\u2019s removal was related to an update Apple made this week that requires developers of revenue-generating mobile games on its Chinese site to obtain a license from the Chinese government as other unlicensed games had not been affected. Apple, which has lagged other app stores in enforcing this rule, has set a June deadline.  The game has been installed by about 2.2 million Apple iOS users in China since its introduction in 2012 of which 9% have occurred since January, according to gaming data tracking firm Sensor Tower.","332":"Apple Inc and director M.

In its order four years ago, the European Commission said Apple benefited from illegal state aid via two Irish tax rulings that artificially reduced its tax burden for over two decades - to as low as 0.005% in 2014.  \u201cThe General Court annuls the contested decision because the Commission did not succeed in showing to the requisite legal standard that there was an advantage for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU1,\u201d judges said, referring to EU competition rules.  They said the EU executive was wrong to say Apple\u2019s two Irish subsidiaries - Apple Sales International (ASI) and Apple Operations Europe (AOE) - had been granted a selective economic advantage and, by extension, state aid.  Apple welcomed the ruling, saying the case was not about how much tax it pays, but where it is required to pay it.  Ireland - which had appealed against the Commission\u2019s decision alongside Apple - said it had always been clear it had not given special treatment to the U.S. company.  The defeat for European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager could weaken or delay pending cases against Ikea\u2019s and Nike\u2019s deals with the Netherlands, as well as Huhtamaki\u2019s agreement with Luxembourg.  Vestager, who has made the tax crackdown a centrepiece of her time in office, saw the same court last year overturn her demand for Starbucks to pay up to 30 million euros in Dutch back taxes. In another case, the court also threw out her ruling against a Belgian tax scheme for 39 multinationals.  Vestager said she would study the court\u2019s judgment and reflect on possible next steps. The Commission can appeal on points of law to the EU Court of Justice, Europe\u2019s top court.  The Commission, which was ordered by the court to pay Apple\u2019s and Ireland\u2019s legal costs, could still salvage its case, said Dimitrios Kyriazis, Head of Law Faculty at the New College of Humanities in London.  \u201cIts defeat is very similar to its defeat in the Starbucks cases, that is it won on matters of legal principle and lost due to the allocation of evidentiary onus,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt is more likely that the Commission will re-adopt a decision against Ireland and Apple and try to show exactly how the tax rulings granted AOE and ASI a selective advantage,\u201d he said.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  IRELAND IN SPOTLIGHT  The European Network on Debt and Development (Eurodad) said the judgment showed the need for corporate tax reform in Europe.  \u201cToday\u2019s court decision illustrates how difficult it is to use EU state aid rules to collect tax. If we had a proper corporate tax system, we wouldn\u2019t need long court cases to find out whether it is legal for multinational corporations to pay less than 1 percent in taxes,\u201d its tax justice coordinator Tove Maria Ryding said.  The ruling puts Ireland\u2019s tax regime back in the spotlight at a delicate juncture. With attempts to get a global agreement on taxing multinationals buckling, plans for an EU tax could be revived, putting Dublin\u2019s low rates in the firing line.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Multinationals, attracted by Ireland\u2019s low taxes, employ around 250,000 people in the country, accounting for one in ten workers at the end of last year.  However, the government has faced heavy criticism from opposition parties for fighting against a tax windfall that would have amounted to 14 billion euros, including interest, and could have covered at least half of a budget deficit forecast to balloon to as much as 10% of GDP this year.  \u201cThis is a bad day for the taxpayer,\u201d said Pearse Doherty, the finance spokesman for the main opposition Sinn Fein party.  \u201cWhile the Department of Finance might be thinking this is a good day for themselves, morally this is a terrible day.\u201d","335":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc\u2019s biggest iPhone assembler Foxconn aims to cut 20 billion yuan ($2.88 billion) from expenses in 2019 as the company faces \u201ca very difficult and competitive year\u201d, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, citing an internal memo.

Shares in Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, closed down less than 1 percent at T$70.60.  Apple shocked investors earlier this month with a lower-than-expected sales forecast for the Christmas quarter that jolted parts suppliers across the world.  U.S. chipmaker Lumentum was among the first to cut forecast along with screen maker Japan Display, followed by financial warnings from Qorvo Inc, British chipmaker IQE and Austria\u2019s AMS.  Foxconn's iPhone business will need to reduce expenses by 6 billion yuan next year and the company plans to eliminate about 10 percent of non-technical staff, the Bloomberg report here said.  Foxconn said it regularly reviews its operations to reallocate resources across its operations.  \u201cThe review being carried out by our team this year is no different than similar exercises carried out in past years...

Sector analysts estimate that Apple cut orders to its Taiwanese suppliers by 20-30 percent earlier in November, mainly because of weak demand for the iPhone XR and XS Max.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The iPhone XR, which costs $749, was announced alongside two other models, the iPhone XS and XS Max, which start at $999. The XR brings many key features of those phones to a lower price point, and analysts widely viewed it as Apple\u2019s effort to bring facial recognition unlocking and its newest processing chip to a wider set of buyers.  But a string of negative forecasts from smartphone suppliers in recent weeks has sparked concerns that the model might not be performing as Apple had hoped.  Those reports, alongside investor anxiety over Apple\u2019s Nov. 1 disclosure it will no longer provide investors with iPhone unit sales data, have contributed to a more than 20 percent drop from Apple\u2019s peak share price in October.  While Apple is still not giving absolute unit sales figures, the company does occasionally disclose to investors which models are selling the best out of its lineup, which currently includes older models such as the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8. Greg Joswiak, Apple\u2019s vice president of product marketing, told Reuters that the iPhone XR is currently Apple\u2019s \u201cmost mainstream product and our most popular iPhone.\u201d  \u201cSince the iPhone XR became available, it\u2019s been the best-selling iPhone each and every day that it\u2019s been on sale,\u201d Joswiak told Reuters.  In addition to including many of the features from its higher-priced models, Apple also made the iPhone XR available in the broadest color palette for iPhones since the iPhone 5C released in 2013.  Apple is planning to promote the red version of the iPhone XR as part of Product Red, the charity effort that gives a portion of sales of red-colored products to the Global Fund for programs to address HIV and AIDS.  Apple offered the red iPhone XR at launch while in the past the company has offered a mid-spring upgrade of a red iPhone model to support the charity.  Joswiak said the company has raised $200 million for the Global Fund so far. Apple plans to promote the red products during and after World AIDS Day on Dec. 1.","339":"July 30 (Reuters) - Apple Inc\u2019s quarterly profit and revenue beat Wall Street targets on Tuesday and its forecast for fourth-quarter sales topped expectations as well, with Chief Executive Tim Cook telling Reuters that \u201cmarked improvement in greater China\u201d drove the results.  Services revenue in the fiscal third quarter rose 12.6% to $11.46 billion, a new record, but missed expectations of $11.73 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Apple CEO Tim Cook told Reuters that after factoring out a one-time payment from lawsuits a year ago and foreign-exchange effects, the services segment growth rate would have been 18%.  China sales fell 4% to $9.16 billion, after declining 22% in the fiscal second quarter. The Chinese smartphone market shipments declined 6% in Apple\u2019s fiscal third quarter, according to market research firm Canalys.  Trade tension between the United States and China have weighed heavily on Apple because it has slowed down economic growth in China, a major market for Apple. Apple effectively cut iPhone prices in China earlier this year after currency exchange rates had made its phones too expensive for many Chinese consumers.  Cook told Reuters that results for mainland China, a subset of Apple\u2019s greater China region, were positive.  \u201cWe actually grew in mainland China,\u201d Cook told Reuters. \u201cNon-iPhone revenue grew 17%. We grew in every category outside of iPhone.\u201d  Apple said it expects revenue for the current fiscal fourth quarter of between $61 billion and $64 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $61.02 billion.  For the fiscal third quarter ended in June, Apple reported a 1% rise in revenue to $53.8 billion and a 7% drop in earnings per share to $2.18, compared with expectations of $53.39 billion and $2.10 per share, according to Refinitiv data. IPhone sales fell 12% to $25.99 billion, about in line with expectations of $25.96 billion, according to Refinitiv data. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/2yAEoCh)  \u201cIn regards to iPhone, the most important thing for us is that we continue to grow the installed base,\u201d Cook told Reuters. \u201cAnd we did that on iPhone. And so the fact that people are hanging onto them a little longer, it\u2019s not something I worry about in the 90-day clock.\u201d  Apple did not give the number of installed bases of Apple devices but said it grew.  TRADE TENSION STILL LOOMS LARGE  Apple reported results as U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators met in Shanghai for their first in-person talks since a G20 truce last month, after which U.S. President Donald Trump said he would not impose new tariffs on a final $300 billion of Chinese imports if China agreed to make purchases of U.S. agricultural products.  Apple\u2019s most important products, such as the iPhone, are primarily made in China but so far have avoided tariffs. But the iPhone would be included in the final $300 billion round as it is currently written.  \u201cI don\u2019t know what the journey will be, but over time I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019ll all get to a good conclusion and everybody will win from it,\u201d Cook told Reuters when asked about the trade talks.  Apple\u2019s market share in China declined to 5.8% from 6.4%, according to market research firm Canalys, in part because smartphone rival Huawei Technologies Co Ltd gained market share to become the top handset seller in the country.  But Apple experienced a smaller market share loss than competitors such as Xiaomi Corp, Oppo and Vivo, according to Canalys data. Cook said that iPhone price adjustments, plus the Chinese government\u2019s move to cut phone taxes, helped keep iPhone sales in China from eroding further.  \u201cOur trade-in and financing programs are doing extremely well in China,\u201d Cook told Reuters. \u201cBecause of the active installed base is growing in China, our services business is doing very well, growing double digits.\u201d  Apple shares have gained more than 20% since early June, when shares dropped on news that the U.S. Department of Justice had jurisdiction over the company in a potential probe as part of a broader review of whether technology giants engage in anticompetitive practices.  The Justice Department formally announced the review last week but did not name any companies that would be scrutinized. Officials said the efforts would focus on \u201csearch, social media, and some retail services online,\u201d an apparent reference to Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc rather than Apple specifically.  But Apple has faced complaints from competitors and developers over its practice of keeping 15% to 30% of revenue earned by developers on its App Store. In March, Spotify Technology SA, Apple\u2019s chief rival in the streaming music space, filed an antitrust complaint against Apple with European Union officials.  Apple\u2019s services, which include Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud, are seen as a source of growth for Apple as iPhone sales have slowed. In the coming months Apple plans to release a credit card and subscription services for gaming and television.  Apple said revenue for its \u201cWearables, home and accessories\u201d segment that contains devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods was $5.53 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $4.81 billion.  Apple said it returned more than $21 billion to shareholders during the fiscal third quarter, including $17 billion in share repurchases. It declared a dividend of 77 cents per share.","340":"June 4 (Reuters) - Wall Street\u2019s three main indexes opened higher on Monday led by gains in Microsoft and Apple as well as Friday\u2019s robust jobs data which continued to boost investor optimism on strength in the U.S. economy.

REUTERS\/David Gray  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Two of America\u2019s fabled technology giants have traded places, with Tim Cook\u2019s Apple playing tortoise to the hare that is Satya Nadella\u2019s Microsoft. This new drama could be on for an extended run.  Apple on Tuesday reported that revenue in the three months to the end of June 29 rose 1% year-over-year to $54 billion. Sales of the company\u2019s iconic iPhone dropped 12%. Service revenue, the money Apple collects from licensing and sales on its app store, grew 13% percent. It\u2019s a bright spot but not enough to offset the bigger drag given it represents only a fifth of the overall pie. The results exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates, and Apple\u2019s stock rose more than 3% in after-hours trading.  Yet compared to its Redmond, Washington rival, Apple looks like a laggard. Earlier in July, Microsoft said its revenue for the same quarter rose 12% to $34 billion as more businesses used its Azure cloud service and subscriptions for its suite of Office products rose.  Microsoft has also overtaken Apple in market worth. A 39% rise in its stock price this year has made it the world\u2019s most-valuable listed company at nearly $1.1 trillion. Add in dividends and Nadella\u2019s company has delivered shareholders a total return of 36% over the past 12 months, three times Apple\u2019s. It has beat Apple on that metric over the past five years, too.  The rivalry between the two tech giants goes back decades. Under founder Bill Gates, Microsoft was so dominant in personal computing operating systems that U.S. regulators tried to break it up. He prevailed but paid a price as Microsoft missed the mobile revolution. A string of costly, questionable acquisitions followed, including $10 billion for Nokia and $6 billion for digital-advertising agency aQuantive.  Cook hasn\u2019t shown signs of retracing Microsoft\u2019s past missteps. Even though Apple is sitting on $102 billion in cash, it rarely makes acquisitions. When it does, like last week\u2019s $1 billion purchase of Intel\u2019s smartphone modem business or a potential investment in SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund 2, they\u2019re small. Apple is more likely to continue with a slow methodical approach. That could leave it in Microsoft\u2019s shadow for some time to come.","343":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - An intensifying trade dispute between the United States and China weighed on global stocks and bond yields on Thursday, but a rise in Apple shares took its valuation above a record $1 trillion and helped major U.S. indexes close in positive territory.

Despite the day\u2019s reprieve for Wall Street, concerns remained over the U.S.-China trade spat, which intensified on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump raised pressure on China by proposing a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.

Apple said it has given businesses affected by the pandemic more time to implement the system and that Facebook is getting the same exemption until year\u2019s end it has given ClassPass and Airbnb.

The Commission has traditionally ordered companies to halt anti-competitive practices.  This may not be enough, especially in digital markets, said Cecilio Madero Villarejo, acting director-general at the Commission\u2019s competition division.  \u201cIn fast-moving markets there is a risk that this would take too long to implement and be too difficult to monitor,\u201d he told a CRA conference.  \u201cTherefore in particular in these markets, fast moving markets, we may design more prescriptive and possibly restorative remedies in order to ensure that conditions for effective competition will be fully restored,\u201d Madero said, without elaborating.  On Monday European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said with hindsight she would have taken a different line with Google despite imposing fines of more than 8 billion euros on the company after a decade-long investigation.  \u201cIf I knew what I know now about Google, I would be bolder,\u201d Vestager told a Politico conference.","352":"Oct 30 (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday is expected to unveil updates to its Mac computers and iPads that include facial recognition features that have been available in the iPhone lineup at an event in Brooklyn.  Analysts expect a new versions of Apple\u2019s iPad Pro, its higher-end tablet computer that competes with the Microsoft Surface, with thinner bezels and more screen space, along with the face unlock system found on Apple\u2019s newer iPhones. They also expect updates to the firm\u2019s Mac lineup such as redesigned MacBook Air, Apple\u2019s $999 entry-level laptop.  Apple introduced new iPhones and Apple Watches last month, but the older product lines accounted for $45 billion in sales in the most recent fiscal quarter. In comparison, iPhones brought in revenue of $141.3 billion.  \u201cThey really wanted to show the world they haven\u2019t forgotten about the iPad and the Mac,\u201d said Mika Kitagawa, a senior principal research analyst at Gartner.  Apple declined to comment.  In July when Apple reported its most recent quarter, the company had its worst quarter of Mac sales since 2010, with unit volumes down 13 percent year over year. And iPad unit sales were up only 1 percent versus a year earlier, and revenue for both was down 5 percent from the prior year.  But some of that dip in Mac sales was explained by timing - Apple waited to release new Macs until July, when it had in previous years offered them in June. More broadly, Macs sales growth has outpaced the PC market and the iPad has been the most successful tablet in a market that simply turned out to be smaller than Apple hoped when it released the device in 2010.  While Apple has held prices down on some items like its entry-level iPads for schools, analyst do not expect it to do so with iPad Pros or Mac laptops. With Mac laptops in particular, consumers increasingly use phones or tablets for quick computing tasks and only reach for a full-fledged computer when they need extra horsepower. Apple is unlikely to cut corners to drop the price of its entry-level laptops, analysts said.  \u201cWith Apple, \u2018cheap\u2019 is always more expensive than everybody else,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies. Apple is likely to pick a price where \u201cyou don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re breaking the bank, but you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re compromising your experience.\u201d","353":"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O has responded to comments made by Apple Inc AAPL.O Chief Executive Tim Cook in an interview, in which he said there had been no recent settlement talks between the iPhone maker and chip supplier in their global legal battle, calling Cook's remarks \"misleading.\"  People walk by a video display promoting 5G connectivity at the Qualcomm booth during the 2019 CES in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. January 8, 2019. REUTERS\/Steve Marcus  Apple on Wednesday said it stood by Cook\u2019s comments.  The two companies are disputing comments their respective CEOs have made over settlement talks. Apple\u2019s chief on Tuesday said any talks ended in September 2018. Qualcomm\u2019s Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf in November made comments about the supplier\u2019s efforts to resolve the dispute.  But Qualcomm on Tuesday said Cook had miscast Mollenkopf\u2019s remarks, which did not mention a settlement and which Qualcomm maintains are accurate.  The war of words is unlikely to play a major role in the outcome of the legal fight between the two firms. But it signals the high stakes and deeply entrenched positions of each side, with Apple arguing in court that Qualcomm charges an unfair \u201ctax\u201d on its phones while Qualcomm fights to protect a patent licensing model it argues has helped bring connectivity to billions of new users through wireless networks.  In a television interview on CNBC earlier on Tuesday, Cook responded to a question from host Jim Cramer about whether Apple would settle with Qualcomm after Qualcomm had announced legal victories against Apple in patent cases in China and Germany.  \u201cLook, the truth is, we haven\u2019t been in any settlement discussions with them since the third calendar quarter of last year. That is the truth. So I\u2019m not sure where that thinking is coming from,\u201d Cook said.  Cook\u2019s comments contrasted with those Mollenkopf made in November on CNBC.  \u201cWe do talk as companies, and I think what you\u2019re seeing, really, are activities consistent, really, with the fourth quarter of the game, and not the first quarter,\u201d Mollenkopf told CNBC then. \u201cWe always talk about - and I\u2019ve been very consistent that this second half of (2018) and into (2019), is when we\u2019re really on the doorstep of finding a resolution.\u201d  In a statement, Qualcomm said the company stands by Mollenkopf\u2019s remarks.  \u201cWe have been consistent for the last 18 months in making clear that we have, at various times, been in discussions with Apple about a possible resolution to our licensing dispute,\u201d a Qualcomm spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe have also stated clearly on several occasions that we believe it will be resolved, one way or the other, in the near future, either through a settlement or court decisions.\u201d  Apple on Wednesday said Cook\u2019s comments were accurate.  \u201cQualcomm is desperate to obfuscate the tales it has been telling its investors. Their accusations are a red herring,\u201d Apple said in a statement to Reuters.  Apple has accused Qualcomm of engaging in illegal patent licensing practices to preserve a dominant market position in so-called modem chips, which help mobile phones connect to wireless data networks. Qualcomm has argued that its practices followed decades-long tech industry norms and that Apple has not compensated it fairly for its intellectual property.  The primary case in Apple and Qualcomm\u2019s legal battle goes to trial in April.","354":"FILE PHOTO: A Tesla dealership is seen in West Drayton, just outside London, Britain, February 7, 2018.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The disclosure came in a court filing on Friday in which Apple asked a federal judge in California to deny a request by \u201cFortnite\u201d maker Epic Games to be kept in the iPhone maker\u2019s App Store as a dispute between the two over Apple\u2019s in-app payment rules plays out.  Epic did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Apple removed the popular game earlier this month after Epic rolled out its own method of making purchases within the game, which Apple said violated its App Store rules. Those rules require games and other apps to use Apple\u2019s in-app payment system, which charges commissions of between 15% and 30%.  Epic sued Apple over the removal, claiming the App Store rules violate antitrust laws. Epic also launched a public relations campaign, with a #FreeFortnite social media push and a parody of Apple\u2019s famous \u201c1984\u201d ad.  In the filing before U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, Apple aimed to frame the dispute as part of a broader business disagreement, alleging that Epic CEO Tim Sweeney asked for an exception to its rules to create an \u201cEpic Games Store\u201d inside the App Store. After it rejected the request, Sweeney criticized how it runs the store, Apple said.  Apple said that Sweeney sent Phil Schiller, Apple\u2019s App Store chief, an email at 2 a.m. saying Epic would no longer comply with the payment rules, and rolled out its own payment system hours later.  Epic has asked the court to issue an order blocking Apple\u2019s removal of \u201cFortnite\u201d from the store, saying that the move - along with Apple\u2019s threat to terminate the company\u2019s developer account - would cause irreparable harm to Epic and should be put on hold while the case plays out.  Epic said the termination of its developer account could also hamper its ability to offer a product called Unreal Engine, a software tool for computer graphics that hundreds of other games and other apps use to power their offerings.  In Friday\u2019s filing, Apple called the removal of \u201cFortnite\u201d from the App Store a \u201cself-inflicted wound\u201d and argued that Rogers should not grant Epic\u2019s request.  \u201cEpic knew full well that, in circumventing Apple\u2019s processes and breaching its contracts, it was putting its entire relationship with Apple \u2014 including its Unreal Engine and other projects \u2014 at serious risk,\u201d Apple wrote in its filing. \u201cEpic made the calculated decision to breach anyway, and then run to this Court to argue that its customers were being damaged.\u201d","356":"FILE PHOTO: The popular video game \"Fortnite\" by Epic Games is pictured on a screen in this picture illustration August 14, 2020.

Apple said its move will not affect Epic Games\u2019 Unreal Engine, a software tool relied on by hundreds of other app makers. But the move means iPhone users will not be able to download \u201cFortnite\u201d or other Epic titles through the Apple App Store. Players who have already downloaded Epic\u2019s games will still be able to play but will no longer be able to make in-app purchases with Apple\u2019s payment system.  On Monday, a federal court ruled that Apple could block Epic\u2019s titles from its store but could not take action that would harm Unreal Engine while Epic\u2019s antitrust lawsuit against the iPhone maker plays out.  Apple pulled Epic after the popular games creator implemented a feature to let iPhone users make in-app purchases directly, rather than using Apple\u2019s in-app purchase system, which charges commissions of 30%.  Apple had said it would allow \u201cFortnite\u201d back into the store if Epic removed the direct payment feature. But Epic refused on Thursday, saying complying with Apple\u2019s request would be \u201cto collude with Apple to maintain their monopoly over in-app payments on iOS.\u201d  Epic\u2019s decision all but assured its account would be terminated, the step Apple took Friday.  \u201cThe court recommended that Epic comply with the App Store guidelines while their case moves forward, guidelines they\u2019ve followed for the past decade until they created this,\u201d Apple said in a statement.  \u201cInstead they repeatedly submit Fortnite updates designed to violate the guidelines of the App Store.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Terms of the settlement, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, were not available.  In May, a U.S. jury awarded Apple $539 million, after Samsung had previously paid Apple $399 million to compensate for patent infringement. Samsung would need to make an additional payment to Apple of nearly $140 million if the verdict was upheld.  How much, if anything, Samsung must now pay Apple under Wednesday\u2019s settlement could not immediately be learned.  An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the terms of the settlement but said Apple \u201ccares deeply about design\u201d and that \u201cthis case has always been about more than money.\u201d A Samsung spokeswoman declined to comment.  Apple and Samsung are rivals for the title of world\u2019s largest smartphone maker, and the dollar sums involved in the decision are unlikely to have an impact on either\u2019s bottom line. But the case has had a lasting impact on U.S. patent law.  After a loss at trial, Samsung appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In December 2016, the court sided unanimously with Samsung\u2019s argument that a patent violator does not have to hand over the entire profit it made from stolen designs if those designs covered only certain portions of a product but not the entire object.  But when the case went back to lower court for trial this year, the jury sided with Apple\u2019s argument that, in this specific case, Samsung\u2019s profits were attributable to the design elements that violated Apple\u2019s patents.  Michael Risch, a professor of patent law at Villanova University, said that because of the recent verdict the settlement likely called for Samsung to make an additional payment to Apple.  But he said there was no clear winner in the dispute, which involved hefty legal fees for both companies. While Apple scored a major public relations victory with an initial $1 billion verdict in 2012, Samsung also obtained rulings in its favor and avoided an injunction that would have blocked it from selling phones in the U.S. market, Risch said.","364":"* Apple\u2019s sales forecast fuels global growth concerns  * EM technology stocks hit heavily, investors rush for safety  * Turkish lira drops against Japanese yen, dollar  * S.Africa\u2019s rand weakens  Jan 3 (Reuters) - Emerging market currencies and stocks slid on Thursday as investors piled into safe-haven assets after an Apple Inc revenue warning fuelled fears about slowing global growth and sparked a sharp drop in risk sentiment.  The iPhone maker\u2019s cut to its quarterly sales forecast, citing weak China sales as a reason, prompted weakness across world markets and investors rushed for the exits.  MSCI\u2019s index of emerging market currencies dipped 0.3 percent, not helped by a soft dollar, while developing world stocks dropped half a percent, as shares in South Korea and Taiwan slid.  Technology stocks in emerging markets bore the brunt of the weakness. A 1.3 percent slide in the sector index left them on target for their lowest close in over two months.  Koon Chow, emerging markets strategist at UBP, said the falls that many emerging market currencies suffered in 2018 had already pre-empted a more difficult macro backdrop. Nonetheless more moves could be in store for currencies such as Turkey\u2019s lira which traded fairly steadily in the last two months of the year.  \u201cThere needs to be a repricing lower of some of these more vulnerable currencies,\u201d said Chow.  \u201cThese dislocations demonstrate the impact of unwinding quantitative easing on market structures and it means that the truly more vulnerable markets out there need to watch their back, so to speak.\u201d  Turkey\u2019s lira, which ended 2018 more than 28 percent lower, softened about 0.8 percent on Thursday.  Against the safe-haven yen, the lira tumbled as much as about 9.2 percent overnight as Japanese retail investors liquidated positions. A move of similar magnitude was last seen in August last year when Turkey was engulfed by a currency crisis.  While the lira regained a chunk of the ground it lost against the yen and dollar, it remained weak. Data showed inflation had eased for the second straight month and came in lower-than-expected at just over 20 percent in December.  \u201cThe Turkish lira was the main victim of escalating risk aversion caused by Apple,\u201d Rabobank EM FX Strategist Piotr Matys, wrote in a note.  \u201cWe are concerned that the price action in USD\/TRY implies that an important bottom may have been made in November and December and that the pair may gain a much better upside traction in Q1 ... 5.46\/45 is a crucial pivot to watch in USD\/TRY at this stage.\u201d  Commodity giant South Africa\u2019s rand weakened 0.2 percent against the greenback.

Earlier this month, the company reopened a handful of stores in Alaska, Idaho and Alabama.  Under Apple\u2019s new procedures, stores with walk-in service will require customers and employees to undergo temperature checks and wear masks before entering. Apple will provide masks to customers who have none. Social-distancing rules will limit the number of people in the store at one time, which Apple said could create delays for walk-in customers.

Apple shipped its iPhone 12 lineup several weeks later than usual, but an expanded number of models and new look appear to have tapped into pent up demand for upgrades, especially in China. The company also posted strong sales of its Mac laptops and iPads in the quarter, driven by consumers working, learning and playing from home during the pandemic.  Apple\u2019s revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 26 rose 21% to $111.44 billion. Earnings per share rose to $1.68 from $1.25. Analysts had expected $103.28 billion and $1.41 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Sales of iPhones were $65.60 billion, compared with estimates of $59.80 billion and beating Apple\u2019s previous quarterly all-time high of $61.58 billion in iPhone sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.  Apple, the biggest U.S. listed public company by market capitalization with a value of $2.4 trillion, has thrived through a pandemic that forced it to shutter many of its stores but prompted many consumers to buy or upgrade devices.  Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told Reuters in an interview that the company now has an active installed base of 1.65 billion devices, compared with 1.5 billion devices a year ago. Cook also said Apple now has an installed base of more than 1 billion iPhones, an increase over the 900 million the company most recently disclosed in 2019.  The pandemic\u2019s travel restrictions disrupted Apple\u2019s product development cycle, with a late launch of its 5G devices temporarily wiping as much as $100 billion from its market capitalization in October.  But even then, Cook and others were optimistic that the phones would become strong sellers, citing early sales data in China. The prediction proved correct, with fiscal first-quarter sales in China rising 57% to $21.31 billion, compared with $13.58 billion a year earlier.  \u201cWe had two of the top three selling smartphones in urban China,\u201d Cook told Reuters in an interview, adding that many of the company\u2019s other products and services also sold well. Cook said that Apple gained iPhone sales in China both from customers switching from rival Android devices as well as existing customers upgrading devices, but said \u201cupgraders in particular set an all-time record in China.\u201d  Mac sales reached $8.68 billion, in line with analyst expectations of $8.69 billion. Apple in November released its first laptop and desktop computers with processor chips of its own design, breaking a nearly 15-year partnership with Intel Corp.  Sales of iPads were $8.44 billion compared with analyst expectations of $7.46 billion.  Cook told Reuters that sales of Macs, iPads and the iPhone 12 Pro model all ran into \u201csupply constraints.\u201d He said that \u201csemiconductors are very tight\u201d but that other areas of the supply chain contributed to the constraints as well.  The company\u2019s services business, which includes its new Apple One bundle of television, music and cloud storage services, had $15.76 billion in revenue, compared with analyst estimates of $14.80 billion.  Cook told Reuters that Apple has 620 million paying subscribers on its platform, ahead of its goal to have 600 million subscribers by the end of 2020.  The services segment also includes sales from Apple\u2019s App Store, whose billing practices have become a flashpoint of conflict with \u201cFortnite\u201d creator Epic Games and whose privacy rules have ticked off a public spat with Facebook Inc.  Apple\u2019s wearables and accessories segment, which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods product lines, hit $12.97 billion in revenue, versus analyst estimates of $11.96 billion. Apple in December released the AirPods Max, a $550 set of over-ear wireless headphones, with shipment dates stretching months into the future within hours of the product\u2019s launch. Cook said short supplies of the AirPods Max could continue into the company\u2019s current fiscal second quarter.  Apple on Wednesday also declared a dividend of 20.5 cents per share. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters that relative weakness in the value of the U.S. dollar added about 100 basis points to Apple\u2019s fiscal first-quarter revenue but did not have an impact on the company\u2019s gross margins.

U.S. President Donald Trump had said he would consider extending tariffs to another $300 billion of Chinese goods if his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping does not yield progress on the trade dispute.  The new round of tariffs would reduce Apple\u2019s competitiveness and cut the contribution it could make to the U.S. Treasury, Apple said in an online filing on Thursday.  Apple said in the document it is the largest U.S. corporate taxpayer to the U.S. Treasury and reiterated its 2018 pledge to directly contribute over $350 billion to the U.S. economy over five years.  Apple said it would also take a hit because Chinese and other non-U.S. firms do not have a significant U.S. market presence.  \u201cA U.S. tariff would, therefore, tilt the playing field in favor of our global competitors,\u201d Apple said.  The levies would also hit AirPods, Apple TVs and batteries and parts. Some of these products were spared from the previous round of tariffs imposed last September on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, but were put back on the list when Trump decided to prepare tariffs on virtually all remaining imports from China.  Officials are in the fourth of seven days of hearings for U.S. manufacturers, retailers and other businesses to weigh in on the tariff plan. Many individuals and companies have also filed letters and comments to the U.S. Trade Representative in an online docket here.  COMPLAINTS LIST GROWS  Coffee and beverage firm Keurig Dr Pepper and technology giant Apple are the latest in a growing list of U.S. companies pressing the Trump administration to abandon plans to impose tariffs of up to 25% on another $300 billion of Chinese imports.  Air conditioner maker Carrier Inc, a unit of United Technologies Corp, said the latest round of tariffs on air conditioner parts \u201cwill result in significant price increases for U.S. consumers of U.S.-manufactured HVAC equipment,\u201d making them less likely to replace older, inefficient systems.  The company said it would take 12 to 18 months to find alternative parts sources, and higher costs may force it to exit lower-priced segments of the air conditioning market.  Companies such as Dell Technologies Inc, HP Inc, and Walmart Inc have already voiced their opposition.  Wearable device maker Fitbit Inc in a letter said tariffs would result in a competitive advantage for Chinese device makers in the U.S. market, sparking \u201cnational security concerns by placing sensitive U.S. health, location and financial data within the Chinese government\u2019s reach.\u201d  Chinese rivals are willing to sacrifice profits to gain market share \u201cin a manner that U.S. companies like Fitbit cannot afford,\u201d it said.  FROM COMPUTERS TO K-CUPS  Some 88 percent of all coffee brewers sold in the United States are imported from China, Keurig counsel said in its public comments. The company\u2019s own brewers are in over 28 million homes and used in more than 1 million hotel rooms, the letter to the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s Office said.  \u201cThis is significant, for the manufacturers directly affected and coffee-drinking U.S. consumers who will have no choice but to pay higher prices for coffee brewers, or forgo their daily morning brew,\u201d the company said.  Many U.S. companies rely on China to source a vast array of products. Finding alternative suppliers will raise costs, in many cases more than the 25% tariffs, some witnesses have this week told a panel of officials from USTR, the Commerce Department, State Department and other federal agencies.  The proposed list, which will be ready for a decision by Trump as early as July 2, includes nearly all consumer products. It has been loudly opposed by retailers like Dollar Tree, which is one of the top 50 U.S. employers and seventh largest importer, the company said in its public comments.  \u201cSimply put, the imposition of an additional 25% duty on the types of everyday, household products that we offer will have a significant and disproportionate negative impact on middle- and low-income American households,\u201d Dollar Tree said.  The tariffs could also hit Christmas sales hard, particularly cellphones, computers, toys and electronic gadgets.","371":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Oprah Winfrey is returning to her talk show format with a new series on Apple TV+, whose first episodes will focus on racism in the United States, Apple Inc AAPL.O and Winfrey announced on Monday.

The combined value of the S&P 500\u2019s five biggest companies - Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp , Facebook Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc - now stands at more than $7 trillion, accounting for almost 25% of the index\u2019s market capitalization. That compares with less than 20% pre-pandemic.  The quintet\u2019s burgeoning share prices reflect a transition to an increasingly technology-driven economy that has been accelerated by the coronavirus outbreak, as doorways fill with Amazon packages, homebound families stream movies and friends commiserate on Facebook.  Yet the companies are drawing opposition. U.S. lawmakers are accusing them of stifling competition, a charge also leveled in recent days against Apple by Epic Games, creator of the popular game Fortnite.  Some investors worry the companies powering this year\u2019s equity rally could become the market\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel if a legal assault, a shift to undervalued names or a move higher in bond yields dries up appetite for technology stocks.  \u201cPeople see these companies as winners and investors are willing to pay any price to own them,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. \u201cThat\u2019s always a risk.\u201d  LEGAL THREAT  One potential threat comes from an array of investigations and legal actions.  The latest came Monday, when a federal judge temporarily blocked Apple from cutting off all the developer accounts of Epic Games, pending a full hearing on the issue. It was a partial win for Epic, which had called Apple\u2019s rules an anticompetitive abuse of power.  The standoff centers on Apple\u2019s App Store, which forms the centerpiece of a $46.3 billion-per-year services business that has helped buoy the company\u2019s share price.  The decision \u201cis just a first battle of many on the horizon,\u201d said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. \u201cFrom a valuation perspective, there\u2019s clearly an overhang around antitrust.\u201d  Wedbush nevertheless raised its target price for Apple on Wednesday to $700 a share in a \u201cbull case\u201d scenario, citing a \u201conce in a decade\u201d opportunity to take advantage of as many as 950 million potential iPhone upgrades worldwide.  Apple shares on Thursday closed at $500.04.  Still, this week\u2019s Apple court decision may be a taste of things to come for technology giants, whose influence has been one of the few issues capable of galvanizing bipartisan interest among lawmakers.  Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon and Apple face a series of federal government probes into allegations that they unfairly defend their market share, with litigation against Alphabet possible later this year.  \u201cThese few behemoths dominate their industry and can set the rules of the global economy,\u201d said U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat who has been outspoken about antitrust issues. \u201cThis kind of concentrated power is always dangerous.\u201d  The opposition is a worry for investors hoping the companies will continue delivering robust growth that justifies their valuations.  Amazon said it operates in a \u201cfiercely competitive\u201d market, citing U.S. Census Bureau data that only about 10% of U.S. retail sales occur online.  Apple declined comment. The company previously said it competes vigorously against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and other Android device makers in the smart phone markets.  Alphabet declined comment. It previously said it competes with Amazon, Microsoft, Comcast Corp, AT&T Inc and many others.  Facebook and Microsoft had no immediate comment.  INVESTMENT DILEMMA  For some investors, the companies embody a dilemma that has dogged them at various times during the last decade. Many have found that cutting exposure to tech-related shares has limited portfolio performance over the long term.  The Big Five have seen their shares jump 22% or more to record highs this year, with Amazon soaring 86%. By comparison, the median stock performance across the S&P 500 year-to-date is a 4% drop.  The companies\u2019 \u201cincreased market share ... provides potentially huge opportunities supporting growth prospects over many years,\u201d said David Polak, equity investment director at $1.7 trillion Capital Group, which owns shares of big technology companies.  Still, some worry that a bad patch in the companies\u2019 widely owned shares could trigger violent swings in broader markets.  Goldman Sachs analysts said in a recent report that the S&P 500 \u201chas never been more dependent on the continued strength of its largest constituents.\u201d  Another risk is a broad-based economic rebound boosting earnings of companies that have underperformed during the pandemic, potentially making their shares more competitive with tech stocks, said Edwin Jager, head of fundamental equities at hedge fund firm DE Shaw & Co, which oversees more than $50 billion.  In addition, a sustained rise in bond yields could make growth stocks less attractive, Jager said. Longer-term Treasury yields hit multi-month highs on Thursday after the Federal Reserve announced a shift in monetary strategy.  A change of sentiment toward big tech could take a comparatively heavier toll on the shares of less profitable technology companies that have rallied alongside the market\u2019s giants.  Investors justify these stocks on the basis that \u201cthis time it\u2019s different,\u201d said Ed Cole, managing director of equities at $27 billion Man GLG. \u201cIt rarely ever is.\u201d","375":"March 8 (Reuters) -  * APPLE CEO TIM COOK OFFERED EMPLOYEES AT MOST OF ITS GLOBAL OFFICES THE ABILITY TO WORK FROM HOME AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK- BLOOMBERG  * APPLE'S COOK TOLD EMPLOYEES AT SEVERAL GLOBAL OFFICES TO \u201cPLEASE FEEL FREE TO WORK REMOTELY IF YOUR JOB ALLOWS\u201d FOR WEEK OF MARCH 9 TO 13 - BLOOMBERG Source text : bloom.bg\/2TzvUGP Further company coverage:","376":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc's AAPL.O multi-hundred billion cash stockpile and stalling growth in services such as iCloud present an opportunity and a concern that some investors hope will be addressed in the company's quarterly earnings report on Tuesday.  The iPhone is by far the biggest product from Apple, accounting for more than 60 percent of its revenue last year, but Chief Executive Tim Cook and other executives have targeted services as a path to growth.  Disappointing forecasts from the iPhone supply chain have lowered expectations for unit sales.  Analysts such as Bernstein\u2019s Toni Sacconaghi estimate as few as 51 million handsets were sold in the fiscal second quarter, versus Wall Street expectations of 54 million phones, versus 50.7 million in the year-ago period. Overall, Wall Street has lowered its expectations for iPhone revenue from $39.7 billion on April 17 to $39.2 billion, according to an average of estimates from 17 analysts by Thomson Reuters.  Sacconaghi expects the iPhone business to dominate discussions of the results, but some investors think a better question is whether Apple can deliver on its plan to ramp up services revenue from Apple Music, iCloud and the App Store.  \u201cWhen people asked what Apple\u2019s next big product was, we kept saying it was services for several years, but then last quarter it stalled. Apple is like an A student with a bad report card. We\u2019re not going to throw them out of the house just yet, but we want to see that number pick back up,\u201d said Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital Partners.  Miller, an Apple investor, wants Apple to use some of its cash to boost share repurchases and reinvest some in the services business. In February, Apple said that segment grew 18 percent to $8.4 billion, missing analyst expectations of $8.6 billion and down slightly from $8.5 billion the quarter before.  Wall Street expects $8.4 billion in services revenue this quarter, according to a Thomson Reuters average of 17 analyst estimates.  Tom Plumb, founder of Wisconsin Capital Management and an Apple shareholder, said Apple should seek out recurring revenue in areas such as financial services. Apple could use the cash to bolster its Apple Pay product by buying a company like American Express Co AXP.N or making other investments to make consistent revenue off transactions.  \u201cThey\u2019re seeing the maturing of this technology cycle. I\u2019m afraid their mentality is, \u2018Oh, we need another big product and cycle with opportunities like this one,\u2019\u201d Plumb said. \u201cBut what they really need is a recurring revenue model to participate in all these changes around the world.\u201d  Hal Eddins, chief economist at Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said that many of the massive acquisition targets often tossed around as possibilities for Apple, such as Netflix Inc NFLX.O or Tesla Inc TSLA.O, do not make sense from a valuation standpoint. This is because Apple would be paying a premium relative to its own price-earnings ratio, which sits below overall market averages, he noted.  His request: an increase in Apple's dividend, which lags those of other tech firms such as Intel Corp INTC.O or Cisco Systems Inc CSCO.O.","377":"(Corrects typographical error in the ninth paragraph)  Jan 8 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc on Tuesday responded to comments Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook made in an interview, in which he said there had been no recent settlement talks between the iPhone maker and chip supplier in their global legal battle, calling Cook\u2019s remarks \u201cmisleading.\u201d  The two companies are disputing comments their CEOs have made over settlement talks: Apple\u2019s chief on Tuesday said any talks ended in September 2018. In November, Qualcomm\u2019s Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf made comments about the supplier\u2019s efforts to resolve the dispute.  Qualcomm on Tuesday said Cook miscast Mollenkopf\u2019s remarks, which did not mention a settlement and which Qualcomm maintains are accurate.  The war of words is unlikely to play a major role in the outcome of the legal fight between the two firms. But it signals the high stakes and deeply entrenched positions of each side, with Apple arguing in court that Qualcomm charges an unfair \u201ctax\u201d on its phones while Qualcomm fights to protect a patent licensing model it argues has helped bring connectivity to billions of new users through wireless networks.  In a television interview on CNBC earlier on Tuesday, Cook responded to a question from host Jim Cramer about whether Apple would settle with Qualcomm after Qualcomm had announced legal victories against Apple in patent cases in China and Germany.  \u201cLook, the truth is, we haven\u2019t been in any settlement discussions with them since the third calendar quarter of last year. That is the truth. So I\u2019m not sure where that thinking is coming from,\u201d Cook said.  Cook\u2019s comments contrasted with those Mollenkopf made in November on CNBC.  \u201cWe do talk as companies, and I think what you\u2019re seeing, really, are activities consistent, really, with the fourth quarter of the game, and not the first quarter,\u201d Mollenkopf told CNBC then. \u201cWe always talk about \u2013 and I\u2019ve been very consistent - that this second half of and into, is when we\u2019re really on the doorstep of finding a resolution.\u201d  In a statement, a Qualcomm spokesperson said the company stands by Mollenkopf\u2019s remarks.  \u201cWe have been consistent for the last 18 months in making clear that we have, at various times, been in discussions with Apple about a possible resolution to our licensing dispute,\u201d a Qualcomm spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe have also stated clearly on several occasions that we believe it will be resolved, one way or the other, in the near future, either through a settlement or court decisions.\u201d  The primary case in Apple and Qualcomm\u2019s legal battle goes to trial in April.  Apple has accused Qualcomm of engaging in illegal patent licensing practices to preserve a dominant market position in so-called modem chips, which help mobile phones connect to wireless data networks. Qualcomm has argued that its practices followed decades-long tech industry norms and that Apple has not fairly compensated it for its intellectual property.

Slideshow ( 5 images )  Loss-making for the last five years and with its liabilities now exceeding assets, Japan Display desperately needs a capital injection.  For Apple, any collapse of Japan Display would hurt its ability to deliver competitive pricing for its new iPhone 11 base model which is $50 cheaper than last year\u2019s XR model. It might also force the U.S. firm to turn to rival suppliers for liquid crystal displays (LCD) and increase its reliance on Samsung Display for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens.  Japan Display has said a major client, which sources with direct knowledge of the talks have said is Apple, intends to invest $200 million, double the amount it previously planned. Hong Kong-based Oasis Management will also contribute $150-180 million. A Japan Display supplier and other funds are also set take part.  \u201cWe are close to 50 billion and I believe we can cement the deal this month,\u201d new Chief Executive Minoru Kikuoka told Reuters in an interview.  The planned revised bailout deal is, however smaller than a previously announced plan for as much as 80 billion yen. Chinese investment firm Harvest Group pulled out of the deal last month, citing differences with other investors over corporate governance.  Kikuoka, who took the helm in September, said LCD screens are drawing renewed market interest, pointing to solid demand for affordable smartphones with low-cost displays.  Orders for LCD screens from a major customer have been \u201cstronger than previously planned,\u201d Kikuoka said. The comment follows a recent Nikkei Asian Review report that Apple has asked suppliers to increase production of its iPhone 11 models by around 10%.  Although a late shift to OLED screens has cost it orders from Apple and is responsible for much of Japan Display\u2019s financial woes, the U.S. tech giant still accounted for about 60% of its revenues in the last financial year ended March.  Kikuoka said the company has started producing OLED screens. Sources have said Japan Display will produce OLED screens for the Apple Watch this year.  But venturing into mass-production of OLED panels for smartphones would require at least 200 billion yen ($1.9 billion) to convert an idle LCD plant, Kikuoka said, adding that would depend on whether it could find partners to shoulder that cost.  \u201cWe are not planning to make capital investments on our own for OLED,\u201d he said, adding that excessive capacity for LCD production has drained the company\u2019s balance sheet and that any discussions on OLED for smartphones would come after a bailout was in place.  Japan Display is also considering making its smartphone panel division into a separate company, possibly drawing on capital from external partners, a move that could help reduce the impact of smartphone market volatility on its earnings, Kikuoka said.

But the discount window did not stay open long, with Apple\u2019s stock back at a record high above $183 on Friday after trading in the mid-$150s for part of the first quarter.  The recovery in the share prices makes it less opportune for Apple\u2019s corporate treasury to execute purchases as it proceeds with an additional $100 billion of buybacks in an effort to further winnow down its mountain of cash.  Apple bought more than $23 billion of its own shares in the first three months of the year at an average price of $171.48, the company said this week. A Buffett representative on Friday confirmed Berkshire Hathaway increased its stake in Apple by 75 million shares, for which the company looks to have paid between $12 billion and $13 billion, based on the stock\u2019s trading range during the period.  Funds from the repatriation of Apple\u2019s $252 billion overseas cash hoard arrived at an convenient time for traders working on behalf of Apple. The Cupertino, California, company\u2019s massive share purchase in the March quarter coincided with a 10 percent slump in the S&P 500 between Jan 26 and Feb 8.  That drop raised fears across Wall Street that a nine-year bull market was ending and made it easier for big players amassing shares in a company to find willing sellers.  Apple shares fell even more than the broader market, tumbling over 13 percent from their record high close. But while the S&P 500 has remained in correction territory, Apple shares quickly recovered, and it seems the company and Berkshire were there to help.  Buffett, a billionaire bargain hunter, increased his company\u2019s stake to 240.3 million shares worth $42.5 billion during first quarter.  At its low in February, the stock was available for as little as $150, an 18 percent discount to its current price.  On more than a third of the trading days during the March quarter, Apple\u2019s stock traded below its volume weighted average price, or VWAP, for the prior 60 days.  On Feb 8, when it closed at $155.15, the low for the quarter, it was at a nearly 10 percent discount from its 60-day average VWAP. The stock had not been available at such a large discount to its prevailing average since May 2016, which happens to be when Buffett bought his first-ever shares of Apple.  At its close of $183.83 on Friday, however, Apple now stands at a premium of nearly 7 percent to its 60-day VWAP of $172.11.  Prior to last quarter, Apple\u2019s largest-ever quarterly repurchase occurred in early 2014, a year after it initiated its first $210 billion buyback program. The stock traded at a discount to its 60-day VWAP through much of the quarter, and Apple spent $18 billion to buy up its own shares, according to filings.","387":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in an Eikon news window.)  * Apple gains despite Nikkei report on output-cut plans  * Trade-sensitive Boeing boosts Dow  * Fed officials say caution needed before more rate hikes  * Indexes: Dow +0.46 pct, S&P 500 +0.42 pct, Nasdaq +0.81 pct (Adds details on market move following Fed minutes)  Jan 9 (Reuters) - Wall Street rallied for a fourth session on Wednesday, led by Apple, chipmakers and other trade-sensitive stocks, after signs of progress in trade talks between the United States and China.  The benchmark S&P 500 is up about 10 percent from a 20-month low it touched around Christmas, boosted by hopes for a deal between the world\u2019s two largest economies, which eased some worries over the impact of the trade spat on global growth.  Market participants were also encouraged by strong U.S. jobs data and recent indications the Federal Reserve is in no rush to raise interest rates.  The U.S. Federal Reserve released minutes showing a range of policymakers said in December they could be patient about future interest rate increases and a few did not support the central bank\u2019s rate increase that month.  China pledged to purchase \u201ca substantial amount\u201d of agricultural, energy and manufactured goods and services from the United States, the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office said, as talks wrapped up in Beijing.  The S&P technology index rose 1.22 percent, with Apple Inc up 2.3 percent despite a Nikkei report that the company had reduced planned production for its three new iPhone models for the January-March quarter.  The company\u2019s shares tumbled about 10 percent last week after it warned on holiday quarter sales and its suppliers, which largely include chipmakers, took another beating on Tuesday after Samsung Electronics flagged weak chip demand.  The Philadelphia Semiconductor index gained 2.32 percent. Chipmakers are among the U.S. multinationals with the highest revenue exposure to China.  \u201cIf you want to gauge how investors are viewing the trade talks, just watch tech, and semiconductors in particular,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago.  Shares of Boeing Co, which also has a large exposure to China, climbed 1.11 percent, with the S&P industrial index gaining 0.73 percent.  The CBOE Volatility index, often referred to as an investor fear gauge, dropped half-a-point to a one-month low of 20.  At 2:41 pm ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.46 percent at 23,896.83 points, while the S&P 500 had gained 0.42 percent to 2,585.27.  The Nasdaq Composite added 0.81 percent to 6,952.73.  Financial stocks rose 0.57 percent, with Citigroup climbing 2 percent.  Echoing the Fed minutes released on Wednesday, many policymakers said they could wait on any further interest rate hikes until they had a better handle on whether growing risks will undercut an otherwise solid U.S. economic outlook.  \u201cA more stable Fed is going to lead to more stable markets over time,\u201d said Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer at Penn Mutual Asset Management in Horsham, Pennsylvania.  \u201cSome of the sharp moves in the market were driven by the fact that Fed tightening is starting to have an impact on economic growth and financial conditions.\u201d  Shares in Constellation Brands Inc sank 11 percent, dragging down the consumer staples index, after the Corona brewer cut its fiscal 2019 profit outlook.

REUTERS\/Gonzalo Fuentes  (Reuters) - Apple Inc said on Monday it had expanded a program that provides parts and training to independent repair shops to cover its Mac computers.  Apple initially launched the program last year, but it only covered iPhones, the company\u2019s biggest-selling product. Mac users previously either had to use Apple or an authorized warranty service provider to get fixes with parts directly from Apple.  Apple last month reported an uptick of 21.6% in quarterly Mac sales to $7 billion, as many employees shifted to working from home. Its market share grew to 7.3% in the second quarter from 6.3% a year earlier, according to research firm IDC.  \u201cWhen a device needs repairs, we want people to have access to a safe and reliable solution \u2014 this latest expansion joins the thousands of repair locations we\u2019ve added over the past year,\u201d Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to bringing that convenient and trustworthy repair experience to our Mac users.\u201d  Apple\u2019s shift in repair practices came after years of calls from right-to-repair groups who had criticized the company for, among other things, only providing genuine parts and training manuals to firms such as Best Buy Inc that were to do warranty-related work on its devices. Smaller shops argued that program was too costly to join due to volume commitments.  With the independent repair program, Apple began offering to sell parts and provide free training courses to independent shops to perform out-of-warranty work.  Nathan Proctor, head of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group right-to-repair campaign, said the addition of Mac's program was a \"welcome\" step, but the agreement for independent shops reported by publication Vice here showed \"onerous\" terms.  \u201cAt the end of the day, we either have a free market to fix the devices we own, or we don\u2019t,\u201d Proctor said in a statement.  Apple on Monday said it has updated its materials and training for the program based on feedback from independent shops and other interested parties.","389":"(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Thursday objected to a move by mobile chip supplier Qualcomm Inc to introduce internal Apple Inc documents in its fight to stop the enforcement of a May antitrust ruling.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  On Tuesday, Qualcomm submitted them to U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in opposition to a sweeping ruling that would alter its business model as it pursues an appeal. In the slides from internal Apple presentations, the iPhone maker outlined goals to \u201cCreate Leverage by Building Pressure\u201d and \u201cHurt Qualcomm Financially.\u201d  The slides were part of the opening statement presentation in Qualcomm\u2019s separate civil trial against Apple in April but were never submitted during Qualcomm\u2019s earlier trial with the FTC. If Koh accepts them, they would become part of the record that higher courts review when Qualcomm eventually files an appeal.  FTC officials on Thursday said the submission of the slides was \u201cimproper, unfair, and prejudicial.\u201d  The slides were part of Qualcomm\u2019s opening arguments from the Apple trial, in which the company outlined what its attorneys described as a targeted campaign by Apple to attack Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing model. In them, Apple discussed how to \u201cdevalue\u201d the kind of patents held by Qualcomm and \u201cReduce Apple\u2019s Net Royalty to Qualcomm.\u201d  The FTC said it had no formal chance to object to the slides.  \u201cHad the document survived a high-priority objection, an Apple witness may have testified to, among other things, the document\u2019s context and purpose and the meaning of the cited language,\u201d the FTC wrote Thursday.  Qualcomm, which supplies modem chips to connect phones to wireless data networks, is fighting for a freeze of Koh\u2019s ruling, which could potentially slice its patent royalties from several dollars per phone to pennies.  Smartphone maker LG Electronics Inc has opposed Qualcomm\u2019s efforts to freeze the ruling. The phone maker said it is negotiating chip supply and patent license agreements with Qualcomm and could be forced into signing another unfair deal unless Koh\u2019s protections remain in place. The FTC had also opposed Qualcomm\u2019s move.  On Tuesday, Qualcomm responded to LGE\u2019s allegations by saying that it had continued to supply chips to the Korean phone maker despite the fact that license negotiations ground to a halt and LGE had no license at all with Qualcomm earlier this year, the precise scenario that phone makers have argued could prompt Qualcomm to cut off chip supplies if Koh\u2019s ruling is not enforced.","390":"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Facebook FB.O and Microsoft's MSFT.O grievances over how their gaming apps appear on Apple's AAPL.O App Store may feed into an EU investigation into the iPhone maker's business as EU antitrust regulators said such concerns are on their radar.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  The European Commission in June opened four probes into Apple, three of which are into its App Store and its restrictive rules, including requirements that app developers use its own in-app purchasing system.  U.S. social media giant Facebook and Microsoft are the latest companies to voice concerns about the rules, which have drawn criticism from app developers who say they create an uneven playing field to compete with the iPhone maker.  Asked about Facebook and Microsoft\u2019s issues with Apple, Commission spokeswoman Arianna Podesta said in a statement: \u201cThe Commission is aware of these concerns regarding Apple\u2019s App Store rules.\u201d  She did not provide details.  Apple dismissed criticism of its App Store rules, saying the same set of rules applies to all apps to protect customers and provide a fair and level playing field for developers.  Sony\u2019s PlayStation Remote and Valve\u2019s SteamLink are allowed on the App Store, it said, and developers can reach users via its web browser Safari, where they can also build stores and services.  Facebook last week said its gaming app was only available on Apple\u2019s App Store as a streaming service and that users will not be able to play games.  Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said the company had to remove gameplay functionality entirely to secure Apple\u2019s approval of its Facebook Gaming app.  Microsoft, which has a game-streaming service called Project xCloud said: \u201cApple stands alone as the only general purpose platform to deny consumers from cloud gaming and game subscription services like Xbox Game Pass.\u201d  \u201cIt consistently treats gaming apps differently, applying more lenient rules to non-gaming apps even when they include interactive content,\u201d it added in an emailed statement.","391":"(Reuters) - Jim Keller, a prominent executive who helped design chips at Apple Inc and Tesla Inc before joining Intel Corp two years ago, left the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker effective June 11, Intel said in a news post.

The sales offset weak demand for smartphones and televisions, while one-off gains from its display business, which counts Apple Inc. AAPL.O as a customer, also boosted profits, the company said. It gave no further details.  The world\u2019s top memory-chip and smartphone maker said operating profit was likely 8.1 trillion won ($6.8 billion) in the quarter that ended in June, far above the 6.4 trillion won analyst forecast by Refinitiv SmartEstimate. It would be the highest quarterly profit since the fourth quarter of 2018.  Revenue likely fell 7% to 52 trillion won from a year earlier, Samsung added, giving only limited data in a regulatory filing ahead of its full earnings figures later this month.  Work-from-home orders and growth in online learning are underpinning chip demand amid the coronavirus pandemic and pushing up DRAM memory chip prices. U.S. DRAM supplier Micron Technology Inc MU.O forecast strong quarterly revenue last month.  \u201cChip demand was stronger than expected due to the COVID-19,\u201d said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment & Securities.

REUTERS\/Kim Hong-Ji  The payment was estimated at 1 trillion won, bigger than a similar 800 billion won payment a year ago, they said.  The handset and TV business may have also fared better than expected due to lower marketing costs and as stores and factories resumed operations worldwide as countries lifted lockdowns aimed at stopping the virus, analysts said.  \u201cThe damage from the pandemic was less severe than the market had expected,\u201d said CW Chung, Nomura head of research in Korea.  Analysts, however, warned that increases in memory chip prices may not continue in the second half of the year as data centre customers are likely to be conservative in stockpiling chips given the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the United States and other countries  While prices jumped 14% on average in the quarter, they were flat in June versus May, data from DRAMeXchange showed.  Shares of Samsung Electronics fell 1.8%, versus a 0.4% fall in the wider market .KS11 as of 0206 GMT.  The South Korean tech giant\u2019s resilient earnings, despite the pandemic, came even as its leader, Jay Y. Lee, faces fresh legal troubles.  State prosecutors are investigating Lee on suspicion of resorting to accounting fraud and stock price manipulation to win control of Samsung Group, Korea\u2019s largest conglomerate. Lee\u2019s attorneys have denied such allegations.  LG Electronics 066570.KS, Samsung's crosstown rival in TVs, phones and home appliances, meanwhile, said its second-quarter operating profit likely fell 24% to 493 billion won, ahead of a 374 billion won forecast by SmartEstimate.

Shipments hit 90.1 million phones, a record for any quarter, giving it global market share of 23.4%, data from research firm IDC showed.  \u201cIn China, Apple seized the perfect opportunity to capture Huawei\u2019s market share in the high end, when the latter has essentially not enough supply even though demand for the brand is still there,\u201d said Nicole Peng, who tracks China\u2019s smartphone market at Canalys.  The data comes on the heels of Apple reporting record holiday quarter sales on Wednesday, with overall revenue crossing $100 billion for the first time. Revenue in Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, surged 57%.  For a graphic on Apple\u2019s iPhone business rakes in record sales:  \u201cWe had two of the top three selling smartphones in urban China,\u201d Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters in an interview, adding that upgraders in particular had set an all-time record in China.  As is often the case in the fourth quarter when it launches new products, Apple took the top spot from Samsung Electronics. The South Korean firm saw a 6.2% year-on-year increase to 73.9 million devices, giving it market share of 19.1%.  Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, unsurprisingly, suffered the most pain, with shipments tumbling a record 42.4% to 32.3 million.  The Chinese tech powerhouse has been battered after the previous U.S. administration blacklisted it on national security grounds, preventing overseas companies from supplying it with key parts including semiconductors.  Huawei is now in early-stage talks to sell its premium smartphone brands P and Mate, two people with direct knowledge of the matter have said, a move that could see the company eventually exit from the high-end smartphone-making business. The company has denied such a plan.  According to IDC, Huawei now ranks 5th compared with the No. 2 ranking it had only two quarters earlier. Research firms Counterpoint and Canalys, which also released data on Thursday, pegged Huawei at No. 6, marking the first time in years that it has fallen out of the top five in their rankings.  China\u2019s Xiaomi Corp, the No. 3 seller, saw its shipments soar 32% while shipments for fourth-ranked Oppo climbed 10.7%, according to IDC.","394":"An Apple computer is shown on Google's company campus in Mountain View, California February 9, 2010.

Now his company and Alphabet, which owns the giant search engine, are bound by tight financial ties. Payments from Google may account for over 10 percent of Apple\u2019s profit, a figure that is likely to rise.  Google pays nearly a quarter of its advertising revenue to partners for sending internet searches their way. Just under half of these payments, or around $3 billion, went to phone makers, operators and browser operators in the second quarter. That figure is rising fast \u2013 it\u2019s about 50 percent more than the same period in 2017 \u2013 because more searches are happening on mobile, and phone makers like Apple get paid for making Google their default search engine.  Apple is entitled to be demanding. The company has sold about 2 billion mobile devices, and well over half are still in use. Apple disclosed in 2014 that Google paid it $1 billion. Goldman Sachs estimates the number this year will be $9 billion \u2013 equivalent to more than one-tenth of Apple\u2019s forecast pre-tax profit for this year, according to Refinitiv I\/B\/E\/S \u2013 and $12 billion in 2019. That\u2019s conceivable, based on Apple\u2019s soaring services revenue, which grew 31 percent to $9.5 billion last quarter.  Sales of iPhones don\u2019t fully capture Apple\u2019s market clout. The company is making devices that last longer, as it emphasized when it rolled out new models last month, so will account for a greater share of devices in circulation. While smartphone sales were flat last year, sales of spiffed-up used phones grew 13 percent according to market-research firm Counterpoint, most of them made by Apple.  The two firms may bicker, but their dependence is mutual. Apple switched voice-driven searches to Microsoft\u2019s Bing a few years ago, but then switched back. Pushing what consumers see as an inferior product would harm Apple\u2019s brand. And Google won\u2019t want to let Apple\u2019s users, who are high-income and buy a lot of stuff online, slip away.

The company argued that Rogers should not grant Epic\u2019s request for an emergency order to restore the game to the App Store.  Apple removed the popular game after Epic rolled out its own method of making purchases within the game, which Apple said violated its App Store rules. Those rules require games and other apps to use Apple\u2019s in-app payment system, which charges commissions of between 15% and 30%.

Pre-orders for Versa 2, which is priced at $200, will start later in the day, the company said, adding that the smartwatch would be available in stores on Sept. 15.  Fitbit has struggled to gain a foothold in the smartwatch category as Apple and Samsung 005930.KS have cornered a bigger share of the market with more sophisticated devices, while its dominant share of the fitness tracking sector continues to be chipped away by cheaper offerings from China's Huawei and Xiaomi 1810.HK, among others.  Fitbit last month cut its 2019 revenue forecast, blaming disappointing sales of Versa Lite smartwatches, a cheaper version that lacked features such as the ability to store music.  \u201cWhile Versa Lite received good present consumer reviews, we saw that consumers were willing to pay more for a smartwatch with additional features,\u201d Chief Executive Officer James Park said on an earnings call with analysts earlier this month.  The company separately launched Fitbit Premium, which will give its users personalized coaching including health reports, workouts and sleep features at a cost of $9.99 per month, beginning September.  Versa 2 and Fitbit Premium are steps to upsell to its existing base of 27 million users by adding more features, according to Scott Searle from Roth Capital Partners.  Searle added that Fitbit Premium provides sleep guidance and insights enabled by 10.5 billion nights of sleep data gathered from its previous models that give it an edge over Apple\u2019s watches.  Fitbit provides five days of battery life on an average against Apple\u2019s watches that only have a day of battery life and loses sleep data as it is charged overnight, he added.  The San Francisco-based wearables pioneer, which has seen its shares sink in the past two years, has been looking for new avenues to boost sales.  Last week, it signed a contract with the Singapore government to provide fitness trackers and services in a health program it said could reach up to 1 million users.","402":"(Reuters) - Pre-orders for Apple Inc\u2019s latest iPhones have gotten off to a better start than the last cycle a year ago, several Wall Street analysts said on Monday, citing their own research data.

CNBC quoted TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, known as a close follower of the Cupertino, California-based company\u2019s supply chains, as saying that demand for new iPhones is beating his expectations \u2013 and that much of it was due to Chinese consumers.  Greater China was the third biggest region in terms of sales in 2018 and after raising alarms after slack sales growth earlier this year, Apple has seen bumps in demand driven by discounting by Chinese online retailers.  Chinese e-commerce site JD.com on Saturday said on its official Weibo account that day one pre-sales for the iPhone 11 series jumped 480% versus the previous year, with the top three most popular products being the iPhone 11 Pro in midnight green, and the standard iPhone 11 in black and purple.  Chinese media outlet Yicai also said on Monday that they jumped 335% on Alibaba\u2019s Tmall platform on the first day of sales vs pre-sales for the iPhone XR last year, citing Tmall figures.  CNBC said that Kuo had boosted his forecast for iPhone 11 series shipments from between 65 million and 70 million units in 2019 to between 70 million and 75 million units.  While giving numbers that did not compare directly with Kuo\u2019s, analysts at two other brokerages also said that the initial orders were looking good.  Instinet, owned by Japanese bank Nomura, cited \u201cshipment\u201d checks for its conclusions, while Wedbush\u2019s Daniel Ives said he had conducted supplier checks throughout Asia including China.  \u201cWe are careful about extrapolating first weekend  data, though it is fair to say it is ahead of last year\u2019s launches,\u201d Instinet analysts wrote in a note.  \u201cShould the early shipment time data hold and translate to unit volumes, Apple may be able to offset this year\u2019s average selling price reduction,\u201d they added.

The logo of the multinational semiconductor manufacturer AMS (Austria Mikro Systeme) is seen during a annual news conference, in Zurich, Switzerland February 6, 2018. REUTERS\/Moritz Hager  The Swiss-listed group cut its fourth-quarter revenue outlook by 15 percent and pushed back its medium-term targets, blaming \u201crecent demand changes from a major customer\u201d.  AMS, which specializes in sensors, did not name Apple as the customer, but analysts estimate that the U.S. giant accounts for 40 percent of the Austrian group\u2019s sales.  Apple AAPL.O shocked investors two weeks ago with a lower than expected sales forecast for the Christmas quarter, prompting suppliers including U.S. firm Lumentum LITE.O, British chipmaker IQE IQE.L and screen maker Japan Display 6740.T to issue warnings that pointed to weakness in new iPhone sales.  Like Lumentum, AMS supplies Apple with software components needed for its FaceID technology.  Anglo-German chip designer Dialog Semiconductor DLGS.DE, which struck a $600 million deal with the U.S. tech giant last month bucked the negative trend when it said late on Wednesday it does not see a drop in demand from Apple.  Dialog justified this by pointing out that it supplies many more products than the latest iPhones.  For the past year, investors had largely been willing to overlook stagnating unit sales of the iPhone because average selling prices kept rising. But Apple now faces fierce competition from mid-priced phones from makers such as Xiaomi Corp 1810.HK.  The California-based firm started selling its latest phone generation, the iPhone XS and XS Max in September and the XR model last month.  The new AMS guidance suggested between 11 and 18 million fewer iPhones would be produced in the fourth quarter than an initially estimated 77-82 million, Credit Suisse analysts said in a note to customers.  \u201cThis is largely in-line to read from recent Lumentum warning,\u201d they said, adding the Lumentum guidance would have implied an impact of 15-20 million iPhones.  VOLATILE SHARES  AMS shares gained as much as 6.4 percent to 29.65 Swiss francs after a steep drop in early trade.  They have lost nearly 30 percent since Apple\u2019s latest earnings release and are down 70 percent since the beginning of the year and some investors see a buying opportunity, said traders.  AMS expects revenue to come in between $480 million and $520 million in the three months to Dec. 31, compared with the $570-$610 million it forecast last month.  The adjusted operating margin for the quarter is expected to reach the low to mid-teen percentage range after previous guidance for the margin to rise to 16-20 percent.  AMS also abandoned its 2019 revenue target of more than $2.7 billion, saying it now expects annual double-digit revenue growth for the coming years.  It still aims for a 30 percent adjusted operating margin but no longer gives a specific time frame. It had already postponed the target to 2020 from 2019 in July, at the time due to order delays from a major customer.  \u201cThese guys have no visibility any more,\u201d said Mark Taylor, senior sales trader at Mirabaud Securities\u2019 Global Thematic Group.  AMS, which has invested heavily in research and development and in production expansion, is now seeking to address underutilized facilities, increasing competition and its reliance on Apple.  Although a number of analysts have cut their recommendations recently, many target price recommendations are still above 40 Swiss francs. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see (the stock) rally,\u201d said Taylor.","409":"Dec 18 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google are partnering to lay the groundwork for better compatibility among their smart home products, the companies said on Wednesday.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Apple tightly controls the App Store, which forms the centerpiece of its $46.3 billion-per-year services business. Developers have criticized Apple\u2019s commissions of between 15% and 30% on many App Store purchases, its prohibitions on courting customers for outside signs-ups, and what some developers see as an opaque and unpredictable app-vetting process.  But when the App Store launched in 2008 with 500 apps, Apple executives viewed it as an experiment in offering a compellingly low commission rate to attract developers, Philip W. Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of worldwide marketing and top executive for the App Store, told Reuters in an interview.  \u201cOne of the things we came up with is, we\u2019re going to treat all apps in the App Store the same - one set of rules for everybody, no special deals, no special terms, no special code, everything applies to all developers the same. That was not the case in PC software. Nobody thought like that. It was a complete flip around of how the whole system was going to work,\u201d Schiller said.  In the mid-2000s, software sold through physical stores involved paying for shelf space and prominence, costs that could eat 50% of the retail price, said Ben Bajarin, head of consumer technologies at Creative Strategies. Small developers could not break in.  Bajarin said the App Store\u2019s predecessor was Handango, a service that around 2005 let developers deliver apps over cellular connections to users\u2019 Palm and other devices for a 40% commission.  With the App Store, \u201cApple took that to a whole other level. And at 30%, they were a better value,\u201d Bajarin said.  But the App Store had rules: Apple reviewed each app and mandated the use of Apple\u2019s own billing system. Schiller said Apple executives believed users would feel more confident buying apps if they felt their payment information was in trusted hands.  \u201cWe think our customers\u2019 privacy is protected that way. Imagine if you had to enter credit cards and payments to every app you\u2019ve ever used,\u201d he said.  Apple\u2019s rules started as an internal list but were published in 2010.  Over the years, developers complained to Apple about the commissions. Apple has narrowed where they apply in response. In 2018, it allowed gaming companies such as Microsoft Corp, maker of Minecraft, to let users log into their accounts as long as the games also offered Apple\u2019s in-app payments as an option.  \u201cAs we were talking to some of the biggest game developers, for example, Minecraft, they said, \u2018I totally get why you want the user to be able to pay for it on device. But we have a lot of users coming who bought their subscription or their account somewhere else - on an Xbox, on a PC, on the web. And it\u2019s a big barrier to getting onto your store,\u2019\u201d Schiller said. \u201cSo we created this exception to our own rule.\u201d  Schiller said Apple\u2019s cut helps fund an extensive system for developers: Thousands of Apple engineers maintain secure servers to deliver apps and develop the tools to create and test them.  Marc Fischer, the chief executive of mobile technology firm Dogtown Studios, said Apple\u2019s 30% commission felt justified in the early days of the App Store when it was the price of global distribution for a then-small company like his. But now that Apple and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google have a \u201cduopoly\u201d on mobile app stores, Fischer said, fees should be much lower - possibly the same as the single-digit fees payment processors charge.  \u201cAs a developer you have no choice but to accept that charge,\u201d Fischer said.","412":"* Apple hits $1 trillion in market value  * Tesla jumps after cash burn worries abate  * Dow down 0.10 pct; Boeing, Caterpillar, 3M\u2019s fall weigh  * Nasdaq gains 0.88 pct, S&P up 0.34 pct lifted by tech stocks (Changes comment, adds details, updates prices)  By Amy Caren Daniel  Aug 2 (Reuters) - Apple became the first $1 trillion publicly listed U.S. company on Thursday, leading a rebound in technology stocks and pushing the benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq higher.

Trump\u2019s tweet came amid the investigation into the fatal shooting of three Americans by a Saudi Air Force officer at the U.S. Naval Station in Pensacola, Florida, last month, which Attorney General William Barr called \u201can act of terrorism\u201d on Monday.  The episode marks the latest flare-up in a privacy debate between technology companies such as Apple and Facebook Inc FB.O and authorities.  The tech companies argue that strong encryption protects the privacy and security of their users, while law enforcement officials say criminals have used the technology to evade justice and called on tech firms to provide a way to crack it, using high-profile cases such as Pensacola and the 2015 mass shooting by Islamic militants in San Bernardino, California, as examples.  Trump on Tuesday had harsh words for Apple.  \u201cWe are helping Apple all of the time on TRADE and so many other issues, and yet they refuse to unlock phones used by killers, drug dealers and other violent criminal elements,\u201d the U.S. president said on Twitter. \u201cThey will have to step up to the plate and help our great Country, NOW!\u201d he said.  Apple has said it cannot access data that is encrypted with a passcode and stored on an iPhone and that it would have to build a specific tool for doing so, known in the tech industry as a \u201cbackdoor.\u201d The company can and does, however, hand over data stored on its cloud storage servers to law enforcement officials, which often includes backups of iPhones, including iMessages.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Apple did not respond to a request for comment on Trump\u2019s tweet. On Monday, the company said it rejected \u201cthe characterization that Apple has not provided substantive assistance.\u201d  Earlier on Monday Barr called on Apple to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation unlock two iPhones involved in the Pensacola case.  Apple said it had responded to seven separate legal requests from federal investigators in December, starting the day of the shooting.  The company said it turned over \u201cmany gigabytes\u201d of data to investigators, including iCloud backups, account information and transactional data for multiple accounts. Apple said the FBI did not request help unlocking phones until Jan. 6, with a request for a second iPhone sent on Jan. 8.  \u201cA federal judge has authorized the Department of Justice to access the contents of the dead terrorist\u2019s phones. Apple designed these phones and implemented their encryption. It\u2019s a simple, \u2018front-door\u2019 request: Will Apple help us get into the shooter\u2019s phones or not?\u201d Kerri Kupec, a Department of Justice spokeswoman, said in a statement on Tuesday.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc and Qualcomm Inc on Tuesday opened a complex trial with the iPhone maker using a fried chicken analogy to illustrate its claim the chip company is abusing its market power while Qualcomm alleged a years-long plan by Apple to deprive it of billions in revenue, $13 at a time.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The fate of Qualcomm\u2019s business model, which involves licensing more than 130,000 patents in addition to selling chips, is at stake in the case, which consolidates related lawsuits and countersuits. Apple alleges that Qualcomm\u2019s patent practices were an illegal move to maintain a monopoly on the market for premium modem chips that connect smart phones to wireless data networks.  Qualcomm in turn says Apple used its heft in the electronics business to wrongly order contract factories such as Hon Hai Precision Co Ltd\u2019s Foxconn to withhold royalty payments from Qualcomm that Apple had historically reimbursed to the factories.  A jury of three women and six men will hear the case over five weeks in the San Diego federal courtroom of Judge Gonzalo Curiel. On Tuesday, attorneys sought to cut through the technological complexity and frame key elements of the case in terms the jury could understand.  Apple has objected to a practice that it calls \u201cno license, no chips\u201d under which Qualcomm will not sell chips to a company that has not signed a patent license agreement.  Apple attorney Ruffin Cordell likened Qualcomm\u2019s policy to a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant that refuses to sell a bucket of chicken to customers.  \u201cYou first have to go over to this different counter, KFL - Kentucky Fried Licensing,\u201d Cordell said. \u201cYou have to go pay that \u2018eating license\u2019 fee before they\u2019ll sell you any chicken.\u201d  For its part, Qualcomm alleged that Apple bullied its contract manufacturers into choking off royalty payments to Qualcomm. Qualcomm had been doing business with those factories long before the iPhone, Qualcomm said.  \u201cThe idea that Qualcomm can bully Apple is absolutely remarkable,\u201d said Evan Chesler, Qualcomm\u2019s attorney. Apple \u201cdwarf us in size, but they cut off that money.\u201d  Qualcomm portrayed the move as part of a years-long Apple plan to weaken Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing business, showing jurors internal slides from Apple presentations where Apple talked of wanting to \u201churt Qualcomm financially.\u201d  \u201cIt was all planned in advance, every bit of it,\u201d Chesler said.  Chesler also used iPhone price increases to $1,000 or more in recent years to frame Qualcomm\u2019s technology licensing fees.  \u201cOut of a $1,000 for that phone, what they\u2019re not paying us is $13,\u201d Chesler said. \u201cWhat would your iPhone be worth to you if you stepped five feet to the right and the call dropped out? That\u2019s Qualcomm, not Apple.\u201d","416":"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc shares fell about 3.5% on Wednesday as investors got their first look at the bottom line impact of a patent fight settlement with Apple Inc, including a multibillion dollar one-time payment and more modest future patent fees.  FILE PHOTO: A Qualcomm sign is seen during the China International Import Expo (CIIE), at the National Exhibition and Convention Center in Shanghai, China November 6, 2018. REUTERS\/Aly Song  The stock kept most of the 50%-plus gains of the past few weeks, reflecting investor relief that Qualcomm had found a path to resume supplying chips to the iPhone. But Qualcomm\u2019s forecasts suggested Apple\u2019s licensing fees were not a big enough revenue boost to offset a weakening smartphone market.  Qualcomm will book a one-time payment of $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in the fiscal third quarter from the settlement, as Apple catches up on royalties that the iPhone maker did not pay while they were locked a legal dispute.  Excluding that payment, Qualcomm estimated $4.7 billion to $5.5 billion in revenue, generally below the $5.29 billion analysts were expecting, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The shortfall was driven by a weak Chinese smartphone market, where Qualcomm believes consumers are holding off on buying new phones until new 5G networks roll out later this year.  \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to having a 5G Christmas as the year ends,\u201d Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm\u2019s chip chief, said on a conference call with investors.  The Apple settlement, which includes a six-year patent license and a chip supply agreement, is expected to generate $2 per share in additional earnings, Qualcomm has said. Financial details have not been disclosed but the deal is expected to help Qualcomm regain the preeminent mobile chip position it held in the early 2010s.  Qualcomm estimated $1.23 billion to $1.33 billion in revenue for its licensing business in the third quarter, above analysts\u2019 consensus forecast of $1.22 billion.  The licensing revenue outlook includes royalties from sales of Apple products. Apple on Tuesday said its gross margin guidance, which was largely unchanged from previous quarters, included the Qualcomm settlement. The two disclosures suggest little short-term financial impact from the patent licensing deal.  Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein, said the Apple settlement was in line with expectations but the revenue outlook was disappointing.  \u201cThat tells me that either Apple isn\u2019t giving them all that much, or it says the core market is horrendous, or maybe a little bit of both,\u201d Rasgon said.  But shareholders welcomed the Apple deal.  \u201cI\u2019m just pleased to have Apple back in the fold,\u201d said Hal Eddins, chief economist at Capital Investment Counsel, which holds both Apple and Qualcomm shares. \u201cI think they both came out well in the deal and am very impressed (Apple Chief Executive Tim) Cook agreed to it.\u201d  Qualcomm shares dipped 3.5% to $83.35 in after-hours trading. They shares closed at $57.18 on April 15, the day before the Apple settlement was announced.  Qualcomm executives cited economic weakness in China as a reason for the lower-than-expected sales forecast. Apple said on Tuesday it saw a slight uptick in China sales toward the end of its fiscal second quarter, following cuts in iPhone prices and other factors.  Qualcomm remains in a license dispute with Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, but the Chinese company has been making interim payments as negotiations continue. Qualcomm resolved a dispute with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd last year.  \u201cWe feel that the Apple resolution enhances our ability to resolve issues with Huawei,\u201d Alex Rogers, Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing chief, said on a conference call with investors.  Qualcomm is awaiting a federal judge\u2019s decision in a U.S. Federal Trade Commission lawsuit alleging antitrust violations that mirrored Apple\u2019s claims. The outcome remains unclear after Apple, the major source of witnesses in the case, dismissed similar lawsuits of its own.  Net income attributable to Qualcomm rose to $663 million, or 55 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $330 million, or 22 cents per share, a year earlier.  Revenue fell to $4.88 billion, but beat analysts\u2019 estimates of $4.80 billion.","417":"FILE PHOTO - European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager holds a news conference at the EU Commission's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, June 27, 2017.

FILE PHOTO: A Qualcomm sign is pictured at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Shanghai, China June 28, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song  Qualcomm, the world\u2019s biggest supplier of mobile phone chips, derives most of its profits from a business segment that invents technologies and licenses them. The company forecast between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in revenue for that segment for its fiscal first quarter, above analyst expectations of $1.23 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The licensing business drove the adjusted profit forecast with a midpoint of 85 cents per share, also above analyst expectations of 83 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data. The return of Apple sales also provides Qualcomm a seasonal boost in its fiscal first quarter that ends in December, when Apple traditionally sells its biggest number of devices and therefore pays the most royalties.  On the chip side, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, told Reuters in an interview that the company has won deals to supply 230 device designs with 5G chips, up from 150 a quarter ago.  \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to see strength in the licensing business, particularly after we\u2019ve added in the deal we signed this year with Apple, and we\u2019re on the front end of the 5G transition, which will impact our product business,\u201d Mollenkopf said. \u201cWe\u2019re closer to that and we\u2019re really seeing the signs that we should be confident.\u201d  The news sent shares up nearly 5.1% to $89.00 in after-hours trading.  The company has resolved license disputes with major customers such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS and Apple.  It helps that most of Qualcomm\u2019s customers are actually paying,\u201d Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said.  But Qaulcomm remains in a license dispute with Huawei. \u201cAlthough negotiations continue, we have not reached a final agreement with Huawei,\u201d Qualcomm said on Wednesday.  Qualcomm said it expects between 1.75 billion and 1.85 billion smart devices with modem chips, including 175 million to 225 million 5G handsets, to be sold in 2020. Because Qualcomm collects license fees on devices that use cellular connections to wireless data networks, a greater number of devices sold often results in higher revenue and profits.  The results come a week after Apple calmed Wall Street nerves with improved sales in China, the world's largest smartphone market, and follow strong earnings from chipmaker Intel Corp INTC.O last month.  Qualcomm said that for the fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 29, revenue in its licensing segment was $1.16 billion, beating estimates of $1.10 billion, according to data from FactSet.  Excluding items, the company earned 78 cents per share, topping analysts\u2019 average estimate of 71 cents.

The stocks weighed on the Philadelphia Semiconductor index and the S&P 500 industrials sector, respectively.  \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear there were some tough numbers coming out from bellwether type names like Caterpillar and Boeing, and certainly in the case of Boeing, people are shrugging it off,\u201d said Josh Wein, portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.  Boeing\u2019s shares rose 2%, lifting the blue-chip Dow Jones index, after the world\u2019s largest planemaker reaffirmed the timeline for its grounded 737 MAX\u2019s return to service, as investors looked past a 53% drop in quarterly profit.  The S&P 500 has hovered near its record high this week after signs of progress in trade talks between the world\u2019s top two economies.  Investors are now waiting for results from big tech firms, with Microsoft Corp scheduled to report after markets close.  The earnings season has largely been upbeat with more than 82% of the 124 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far surpassing earnings expectations, according to Refinitiv data. But analysts still project the first earnings contraction since 2016.  At 12:09 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 24.58 points, or 0.09%, at 26,812.68, while the S&P 500 was up 2.74 points, or 0.09%, at 2,998.73. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.83 points, or 0.01%, at 8,105.12.  A 1.6% gain in Facebook boosted the tech heavy index after CEO Mark Zuckerberg sought to reassure U.S. lawmakers about its planned digital currency, Libra.  A handful of healthcare companies with low exposure to China rose on strong results, helping the S&P 500 healthcare sector climb 0.87%.  Alexion Pharmaceuticals jumped 7% after raising full-year forecast, while medical device makers Boston Scientific Corp and Thermo Fisher Scientific both gained about 6% after upbeat profits.  However, Eli Lilly and Co fell 2.8% after the drugmaker missed third-quarter revenue estimates.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.79-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.27-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

In a poll conducted on social media site Weibo, 60% of roughly 350,000 respondents said they would not buy the $399 model, the cheapest iPhone available.  But roughly a fifth said they would buy it, and the rest said they would consider a purchase. Although respondents were not asked for reasons for their choices in the poll, many commented they would be interested if the price drops further.  \u201cIf you don\u2019t buy it and I don\u2019t buy it, tomorrow the price will drop another 200 yuan ($28),\u201d said a Weibo user whose comment got more than 10,000 likes.  Apple\u2019s market share in China, its third-biggest market where it gains roughly 15% of its sales, has shrank over the past several years, as Chinese Android brands steadily release higher-end phones.  Competition has only become fiercer as those rivals are now releasing 5G devices compatible with China\u2019s upgraded telecommunications networks while Apple has yet to launch an iPhone with 5G capability.  Last week several Chinese online retailers slashed iPhone 11 prices by as much as 17%. Apple occasionally lets its Chinese seller partners cut prices to spur demand, though it seldom allows pricing leeway for vendors overseas.  Most China-based analysts said the iPhone SE would mainly appeal to Apple brand loyalists who don\u2019t want to spend roughly $700 for the high-end iPhone 11.  \u201cThe new iPhone SE will for sure attract mid-range users who don\u2019t take 5G connectivity as a necessity,\u201d said Mo Jia, who tracks the global smartphone industry at research firm Canalys.  Tech investors will nevertheless be watching its reception in China to gauge how demand for consumer devices may rebound once the coronavirus pandemic subsides, and whether iPhone sales in China can soften the blow of lost purchases elsewhere.  China is the only major market where Apple\u2019s stores have reopened as the spread of the virus prompts governments around the world to impose lockdowns and other social distancing measures.  Government data showed Apple shipped 2.5 million iPhones to Chinese vendors in March, nearly a fifth higher than the same month a year earlier and a sharp jump from just 500,000 in February when the virus outbreak was at its peak in China.  The company will start taking orders for the phone on its website on Friday, with deliveries expected to start April 24.","429":"* Asia shares rebound after Monday\u2019s fall  * Wall Street shares mostly gain, Apple drags down techs  * Investors expect a split Congress, Democrats to take over House  * U.S. oil prices near 7-month low  TOKYO, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Asian shares ticked up in early Tuesday trade, supported by Wall Street gains although sentiment was tempered ahead of the U.S. midterm elections, the first major electoral test of President Donald Trump\u2019s big tax cuts and hostile trade policies.  MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.15 percent while Japan\u2019s Nikkei gained 0.5 percent, a day after both fell more than one percent.  On Wall Street, the S&P 500 gained 0.56 percent, with financials such as Berkshire Hathaway supported by strong earnings.  In oil markets, crude prices wobbled near multi-month lows after the United States granted eight countries temporary waivers allowing them to continue buying oil from Iran as Washington formally imposed punitive sanctions on the Islamic republic.  Bucking broader gains, the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.38 percent as Apple Inc lost 2.8 percent following a Nikkei report that said the company had told its smartphone assemblers to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to the iPhone XR.  Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s U.S. elections, investors generally expect opposition Democrats to take over the House of Representatives while Trump\u2019s Republican Party is tipped to retain the Senate.  While political gridlock between the White House and Congress could hinder Trump\u2019s pro-business agenda and raise political instability, including hearings centring on the administration, some analysts say such an outcome may have already been priced in by investors.  If the Republicans retain their House majority, global stocks are likely to rally on hopes of more tax cuts.  Trump said last month his administration planned to produce a resolution calling for a 10 percent tax cut for middle-income households.  \u201cEveryone still remembers strong equity rallies after Trump was elected two years ago. So initially stock markets will gain,\u201d said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.  \u201cBut further tax cuts would boost already large fiscal deficits and push the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield above its October high almost instantly. Given rises in U.S. bond yields triggered a correction in equities last month, any rally in stocks is unlikely to last long,\u201d he added.  Many investors also expect Trump to continue to take a hard line on trade, regardless of the outcome of the elections.  In oil markets, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures slipped 0.3 percent to $62.86 a barrel after hitting a seven-month low of $62.52 on Monday.  Major currencies, moves were modest.

The report comes weeks after Reuters reported that Apple was moving forward with self-driving car technology and was aiming to produce a passenger vehicle that could include its own breakthrough battery technology as early as 2024.  Earlier on Friday, Korea Economic Daily TV said the iPhone maker and Hyundai were in discussions to develop self-driving electric vehicles by 2027 and develop batteries at U.S. factories operated by either Hyundai or its affiliate Kia Motors Corp. The broadcaster didn\u2019t cite sources.  \u201cApple and Hyundai are in discussion, but as it is early stage, nothing has been decided,\u201d Hyundai said in a statement. It didn\u2019t say what the talks were about and omitted a reference in an earlier statement to Apple being in discussions with other global automakers as well as Hyundai.  In a regulatory filing issued later, the automaker said it was \u201cgetting requests for cooperation on joint development of autonomous electric vehicles from various companies\u201d, without identifying any of them.  Apple declined to comment. The iPhone maker is known to keep product plans under tight wraps.  An Apple-branded car could be a big challenge to electric vehicle (EV) market leader Tesla Inc. It remains unclear who would assemble such a car, but analysts have said they expect the company to rely on a manufacturing partner.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  \u201cWe continue to strongly believe Apple ultimately announces an EV strategic partnership in 2021 that lays the groundwork to enter the burgeoning EV space,\u201d Wedbush analysts said in a note.  LOWER COSTS  Hyundai and Apple already work together on CarPlay, Apple\u2019s software for connecting iPhones to a variety of vehicles.  \u201cApple outsourcing car production to Hyundai makes sense, because (the Korean firm) is known for quality,\u201d said Jeong Yun-woo, a former designer at Hyundai and a professor at UNIST in South Korea.  \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure whether it is a good strategy for automakers to be like the Foxconn of Apple as automakers face risks of losing control to tech firms,\u201d he added, referring to the Taiwanese contract chip manufacturer\u2019s supply contract with Apple on iPhones.  Analysts said Apple may be interested in using Hyundai\u2019s electric car platform and facilities to cut costs to develop and make vehicles.  \u201cApple could see Hyundai as an ideal partner, because when it comes to legacy U.S. automakers, they all have strong unions, which Apple would like to avoid,\u201d said Kevin Yoo, an analyst at eBEST Investment & Securities.  \u201cMoreover, their (legacy U.S. automakers) labour cost is much higher than that of Hyundai, which often plays a big role when it comes to car production.\u201d  TIE-UP BOOST  A tie-up with Apple would be a major boost to Hyundai, whose global sales last year fell more than 15% as the pandemic took a toll on demand. Friday\u2019s share price surge added nearly $8 billion to Hyundai\u2019s market value.  A longtime champion of rival hydrogen fuel cell cars, Hyundai recently increased bets on battery-powered electric cars, a move welcomed by investors eyeing the recent success of Tesla.  The South Korean company, which sources batteries from SK Innovation Co Ltd and LG Chem Ltd and others, is expected to launch its first car based on a dedicated electric car platform known as E-GMP early this year.  In 2019, Hyundai and auto parts supplier Aptiv launched a $4 billion venture to develop self-driving technologies, naming it Motional. Last month, ride-hailing firm Lyft and Motional said they would launch a multi-city U.S. robo-taxi service in 2023.  Hyundai does not have dedicated electric car factories in the United States and it may have to gain consent from its powerful union in South Korea were it to seek to build EVs overseas, analysts said.  It is not known whether Apple is in talks with other carmakers.  Japanese automaker Honda Motor has not held talks with the iPhone maker, a spokesman told Reuters. Bigger rivalToyota Motor Corp said it does not comment on speculation, as did Foxconn.  Shares in Hyundai Motor jumped as much as 24.8%, hitting a more than seven-year high of 255,000 won, before closing up 19%. Auto parts maker Hyundai Mobis Co Ltd ended the session 18% higher, while Kia shares jumped 8.4%.  Battery makers also gained ground, with SK Innovation closing up 7.6%. The broader KOSPI market closed up 3.97%.","431":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday announced four new iPhones that can tap 5G wireless data networks and a cheaper smart speaker that will compete with offerings from market leaders Amazon and Google.

The Cupertino, California-based company\u2019s Tuesday launch included smartphones ranging from $699 to $1,399 with new designs and 5G technology.  Here are five key announcements from the event:  5G IN ALL THINGS  Apple said all four new iPhone models in the United States will support millimeter wave 5G, the fastest variant of the technology, as well as lower-frequency bands. Some rival Android devices support only the lower-frequency versions of 5G.  Nearly all of Apple\u2019s rivals, including Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, have 5G models on store shelves already. The iPhone maker\u2019s announcement is likely to bring fresh attention to the technology, even if U.S. carriers are still years away from rolling out the fastest versions.

The world's most valuable technology company said it will miss its March quarter sales guidance as the fast-spreading outbreak in China disrupted supply chains. A basket of Latin American equities fell 1%, to its lowest level in one-week with Brazilian stocks leading declines. \"It has shifted people's focus back to the ultimate economic damage in the wake of this coronavirus,\" aid Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York. The warning sent jitters through global financial markets which were off to an upbeat start to the week after China's stimulus efforts on Monday. Most major currencies in the region traded in the red, with Brazil's real weakening for the second straight session and MSCI's index for Latin American currencies falling 0.5%. Chile's peso weakened to its lowest level in three weeks as prices of copper, the country's main export, fell on fears that low demand from China could cause a supply glut. Colombia's peso also eased against the dollar as prices of oil fell more than 2% on demand worries and a lack of further action by OPEC and its allies to support the market.

The Apple logo is displayed at an event at their headquarters in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 10, 2019. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  But it doesn\u2019t mean Apple will keep the lead.  Under the company\u2019s plans announced on Tuesday, any purchaser of an iPhone, Macbook, iPad, or iPod Touch will now get the Apple TV+ streaming service free and will be charged $5 a month only if they decide to continue after the year is over.  Given Wall Street expects Apple to sell at least 130 million iPhones outside of China in the next 12 months, and that last year it sold more than 60 million Macbooks and iPads, that should allow TV+ to easily top Netflix's almost 160 million users. bit.ly\/2lL8G1X  Thereafter, however, all bets will be off, with Apple facing the same need for fresh shows to make subscribers pay, which drove Netflix to sink a reported here $12 billion into new programing last year.  While the company has spent months assembling a roster of Hollywood talent and planned shows, analysts say the $2 billion Apple plans to spend this year is a long way from a guarantee of the hits it would need to pull in viewers, regardless of the cheaper $5 per month price tag for TV+.  \u201cWe believe Netflix\u2019s 10-year head start, scale, breath of content and customer engagement is unlikely to be dented by an Apple TV+ subscription service with a relatively light content slate and no library content,\u201d Credit Suisse analysts said.  CROWDS  The video streaming market is on the verge of becoming a very crowded space, with the new services from Apple and Walt Disney set to compete with Hulu, Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Prime Video and HBO Max.  Analysts say that will change the nature of a business where the relatively limited number of services and the idiosyncrasy of them - Prime for example is bundled with Amazon\u2019s free delivery service - meant users rarely had to choose.  Whereas Netflix in the past took content from a wide range of studios and networks, now many of them will have their own streaming services and keep franchises like, for example, the Marvel cinematic universe, to themselves.  Launching on Nov. 1 in 100 countries, Apple TV+ promises to launch a new show every week and has already announced drama \u201cSee\u201d starring Jason Momoa, \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d with Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, and \u201cHelpsters,\u201d a children\u2019s series from the makers of \u201cSesame Street.\u201d  But that still leaves it way short of the 700 separate shows Netflix made last year, including dozens in the U.S. list of top 100 most-watched. The streaming pioneer also reportedly plans to up spending to $15 billion this year here.  \u201cApple is primarily focused on selling subscriptions to other services (e.g. HBO, Showtime) and modestly focused on original content,\u201d said Daniel Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta who currently owns Apple shares.  \u201cIt seems unlikely that new entrants such as Apple TV Plus will be able to find a footing given how crowded the field has become.\u201d  In that light, Apple\u2019s main focus with the project may prove to be as much keeping iPhone and iPad sales rolling as wading into a costly streaming war.  Analysts from another Wall Street brokerage, Wedbush, said Apple\u2019s base of 900 million global iPhone users could allow it to steal 100 million streaming subscribers within 3-4 years. But they also pointed to iPhone sales, particularly in China, as the company\u2019s bigger priority.  \u201cApple is offering Apple TV+ free for a year ... to help stimulate demand for its trifecta of (new) smartphones,\u201d Wedbush said. \u201cCook & Co. recognize this is a crucial product cycle.\u201d","435":"(Reuters) -Broadcom Inc on Thursday appointed its principal accounting officer, Kirsten Spears, as chief financial officer and forecast first-quarter revenue above estimates as key client Apple Inc doubles down on 5G devices, driving demand for its chips.

Apple\u2019s request was a result of the extended Sino-U.S. trade dispute, but a trade resolution will not lead to a change in the company\u2019s decision, Nikkei said, citing multiple sources.  The iPhone maker has decided the risks of depending heavily on manufacturing in China are too great and even rising, it said.  Earlier this month, credit rating agency Fitch said it views Apple, Dell Technologies Inc and HP Inc as potential blacklist candidates if China blacklists U.S. companies in retaliation for restrictions on Huawei.  Key iPhone assemblers Foxconn, Pegatron Corp, Wistron Corp, major MacBook maker Quanta Computer Inc, iPad maker Compal Electronics Inc, and AirPods makers Inventec Corp, Luxshare-ICT and Goertek have been asked to evaluate options outside of China, Nikkei reported.  The countries being considered include Mexico, India, Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia.

Last week, Foxconn said it had enough capacity outside China to meet Apple\u2019s demand in the American market if the company needed to adjust its production lines, as U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to slap further $300 billion tariffs on Chinese goods.  Analysts at Wedbush Securities said in a best case scenario Apple would be able to move 5%-7% of its iPhone production likely to India in the next 12 to 18 months.  Given the complexity and logistics involved, brokerage said, it would take at least 2-3 years to move 15% of iPhone production from China to other regions.  \u201cWe believe this is all a poker game and Apple will not diversify production out of China overnight and certainly a long-term US\/China trade deal is key for Cook & Co to sleep well at night,\u201d Wedbush analysts said.  China is a key market for Apple as well as a major production center for its devices. The company got nearly 18% of its total revenue from Greater China in the quarter ended March.

An Apple audit found violations of its \u2018Supplier Code of Conduct\u2019 at the plant.  Separately, Wistron said it was working hard to raise standards and fix issues at the factory. It said it had paid all workers and introduced new hiring and payroll systems.  \u201cWe are looking forward to restarting our operations and welcoming back team members,\u201d Wistron said, without giving a timeline.  Neither Apple nor Wistron said when iPhone production would resume at the plant, but three government officials, who declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media, told Reuters operations could begin as early as next week.  Wistron would gradually ramp up production at the factory over the next few weeks, two of the sources said.  Apple began the assembly of its first iPhone model in India via Wistron in 2017. It has since expanded manufacturing with Foxconn in southern India while another top supplier Pegatron is set to begin local operations.","440":"SAN JOSE, California (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Monday told a federal court it has \u201cdeep concerns\u201d that two Chinese-born former employees accused of stealing trade secrets from the company will try to flee before their trials if their locations are not monitored.  FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc. logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, New York, U.S., October 16, 2019. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  At a hearing in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, prosecutors argued that Xiaolang Zhang and Jizhong Chen should continue to be monitored because they present flight risks.  Federal prosecutors alleged Zhang worked on Apple\u2019s secretive self-driving car program and took files related to the project before disclosing that he was going to work for a Chinese competitor. Federal agents arrested Zhang last year at the San Jose airport as he was about to board a flight for China.  Prosecutors allege Chen took from Apple more than 2,000 files containing \u201cmanuals, schematics, diagrams and photographs of computer screens showing pages in Apple\u2019s secure databases\u201d with intent to share them. Agents arrested him in January at a train station on his way to San Francisco International Airport for a trip to China.  The men were each charged with one count of criminal trade secrets theft and pleaded not guilty. They were released on bail shortly after their arrests and have been monitored since then.  Attorney Daniel Olmos, who represents the men, said Monday that both had family reasons to visit China and had shown no signs of violating their pre-trial conditions so far.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Marissa Harris argued that if either man fled to China, it would be difficult if not impossible for federal officials to secure their extradition for a trial. Three Apple employees sat in the courtroom to support prosecutors, including Anthony DeMario, a strategic adviser to Apple\u2019s global security group and veteran of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.  Harris read Apple\u2019s statement to U.S. District Judge Edward J. Davila in San Jose, California.  \u201cApple\u2019s intellectual property is at the core of our innovation and growth,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe defendants\u2019 continued participation in these proceedings is necessary to ensure a final determination of the facts, and we have deep concerns the defendants will not see this through if given the opportunity.  Zhan stood listening through an interpreter and was dressed in a white and blue dress shirt, black jeans and Nike sneakers. Olmos told Davila GPS monitoring was unnecessary to secure Zhang\u2019s appearance at trial.  \u201cThis is not an espionage case,\u201d Olmos said. The government \u201cis not requesting detention, but they are requesting essentially indefinitely location monitoring.\u201d  Harris said Zhang\u2019s wife told federal agents that Zhang, who is a permanent U.S. resident, attempted to flee to Canada when agents searched his home.  During that search, agents found a laptop at the bottom of a laundry hamper that they allege contained trade secrets about Ethernet technology from Zhang\u2019s prior employer, chip supplier Marvell Technology Group Ltd, according to court documents.  Chen, a U.S. citizen who emigrated from China in 1991, listened to the proceedings through an interpreter and wore a dark blue hoodie. He has been under radiofrequency monitoring, which is less precise than GPS tracking.  CONFIDENTIAL MISSILE DOCUMENT  Prosecutors allege that Chen is a flight risk in part because they found documents from several other former employers - including General Electric Co and Raytheon Co - at Chen\u2019s second residence in Maryland, where his wife and son live. Prosecutors said in court papers they found a 2011 document from Raytheon that they later determined was classified as \u201cconfidential,\u201d the lowest level of sensitivity in the U.S. government system.  \u201cThis document contains information relating to Raytheon\u2019s work on the Patriot Missile program and was not (and is not) permitted to be maintained outside of Department of Defense secured locations,\u201d prosecutors wrote.  Olmos, the defense attorney, said it was not a file, but a single paper document \u201csitting in a box somewhere\u201d in Chen\u2019s home.  Trial dates have not been scheduled. A hearing is scheduled for February.","441":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O became the first $1 trillion publicly listed U.S. company on Thursday, crowning a decade-long rise fueled by its ubiquitous iPhone that transformed it from a niche player in personal computers into a global powerhouse spanning entertainment and communications.

REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  COMMENTS:  PAUL NOLTE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT, CHICAGO, WHO OWNS APPLE:  \u201cDo we all get hats for this? To be honest, I don\u2019t know if it has any big implications. Apple is so different than the other tech stocks in the FAANG group... So I don\u2019t know if there are any implications for the FAANG group or technology in general because you had a really very uneven earnings season, with some issues unique to each of those companies, so it\u2019s hard to generalize.  \u201cI would expect to see the dividend increase, announced at their annual meeting. For those that hold Apple, it\u2019s reasonably priced here. We\u2019ve owned it for three or four years now, and it\u2019s probably our second- or third-largest holding. I have trimmed it over the last 12 months just because it was large compared to the rest of the portfolio, so I may do that again if it continues to rise. If it goes up to say $250, I\u2019d trim it a little bit.  \u201cMy concern generally speaking is the FAANG stocks are just incredibly large relative to the rest of the market, and with a lot of passive money going into the S&P 500, ultimately a lot of money goes into those FAANG stocks by default. So it\u2019s a self -perpetuating machine.\u201d  \u201cAmazon is the next closest and given the step backwards that Netflix and Facebook and, to a lesser extent, (Alphabet) took, Amazon has a reasonable shot at getting there.\u201d  KIM FORREST, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP IN PITTSBURGH:  \u201cIt\u2019s something for people to talk about, a number, a threshold to reach. It was inevitable ... this means that Apple did a really good job this quarter.\u201d  \u201cThe more telling thing is if people should be buying it today if they don\u2019t have a position. I don\u2019t know about that. The more practical approach is just because something hits some sort of milestone it doesn\u2019t mean it needs to be purchased today. Enjoy watching it ... Price is always important and why would you be one of the people buying it on a high.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s a good sign for the market and the economy. Because even though today we\u2019re talking about the impact of trade or currency war, an issue with China, Apple who makes most of their products in China is hitting this.\u201d  \u201cIf we can look beyond what\u2019s happening today politically and a group of investors says \u2018I\u2019m buying into Apple,\u2019 that\u2019s a hugely positive sign.\u201d  \u201cThere\u2019s enough momentum in the technology sector because we saw that turn around in the past few days that it didn\u2019t feel like a dead cat bounce. We are in the thick of summer where there are fewer investors paying attention to the market and trading but it doesn\u2019t feel like those weird trading days before a holiday where ... lack of volume is really apparent.\u201d  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t particularly mean a whole lot to a professional investor, like crossing the whole numbers on the Dow. It just doesn\u2019t.\u201d  BRAD NEUMAN, DIRECTOR OF MARKET STRATEGY AT ALGER, A GROWTH EQUITY ASSET MANAGEMENT FIRM IN NEW YORK CITY:  \u201cIt speaks to the power of the company\u2019s platform. We think of Apple as less of a device maker and more of a platform for services, and I think the markets are starting to recognize the value of its platform and services more and more and that\u2019s what is being reflected in the increase in market capitalization.\u201d  PETER TUZ, PRESIDENT OF CHASE INVESTMENT COUNSEL IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA:  \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a tremendous achievement to create a company with a $1 trillion market cap.  \u201cSteve Jobs and his co-founders... created a company that has lasted a long time and continues to capture the imagination of consumers all around the world with their new products and services.  \u201cIt is still, compared to many other companies, not an expensive stock.  \u201cThey still have a long runway with new products and especially getting more people addicted to the various services that they have rolled out.  \u201cI am thinking Amazon is going to get there in the not-too-distant future as well.  \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous achievement. Ultimately, it\u2019s just a number.\u201d","442":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc plans to cut the price of some of its flagship iPhones for only the second time in the device\u2019s 12-year history, pegging its retail value to past prices in local currencies outside the United States instead of the rising U.S. dollar.  FILE PHOTO: People experience new Apple's iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max during a media tour at an Apple office in Shanghai, China September 21, 2018. REUTERS\/Aly Song  The move is an attempt to stem weak sales of the iPhone, particularly in overseas markets such as China, where a 10 percent rise in the U.S. dollar over the past year or so has made Apple\u2019s products - which already compete at the top end of the market - much pricier than rivals.  Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook disclosed the plan on Tuesday after the company reported the first-ever dip in iPhone sales during the key holiday shopping period. The company has only once before cut iPhone prices, shortly after it debuted in 2007.  Apple did not say in which countries it would adjust iPhone prices. Resellers in China already began cutting iPhone prices earlier this month after Apple lowered its sales forecast for the quarter ended in December.  The company priced its new iPhone XS, which was released in September, at $999, the same price in U.S. dollars as its predecessor, 2017\u2019s iPhone X.  That worked for U.S. consumers, but in countries such as China and Turkey the local currency had fallen so much against the surging U.S. dollar, it made the phone significantly pricier than its predecessor a year before. Apple had essentially asked the consumer to bear the cost of the strengthening dollar.  On Tuesday, Cook said Apple will adjust foreign prices in some markets by resetting them at or close to what they were one year before in local currencies. Effectively that means Apple will absorb the cost of the strengthening dollar.  \u201cWe\u2019ve decided to go back to (iPhone prices) more commensurate with what our local prices were a year ago, in hopes of helping the sales in those areas,\u201d Cook told Reuters in an interview.  RISING DOLLAR HURTS APPLE SALES  In the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call on Tuesday, Cook also highlighted the impact of foreign exchange problems in Turkey, where he said the local lira had depreciated by 33 percent against the dollar and Apple\u2019s sales were down by $700 million from the previous year. In November, Apple also cited currency pressure on its prices in Brazil, India and Russia.  Apple has not said when or how often it might reset its prices because of foreign currency changes.  Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said the price adjustments may not extend to its services business, which includes Apple Music and the App Store.  While that unit beat analyst expectations with $10.8 billion in sales in the quarter ended in December, growth has slowed compared to previous years.  Maestri said slower growth was partly because prices rose for users in non-U.S. markets.  \u201cRoughly 60 percent of our services business is outside the United States, and as you know, the U.S. dollar has appreciated in recent months,\u201d Maestri said. \u201cAnd in general, we tend not to reprice our services for foreign exchange on a very frequent basis.\u201d","443":"FILE PHOTO: Illustration photo of the Shazam application on a mobile phone December 12, 2017.

Shares in the Anglo-German chip designer rose by 9 percent, building on gains made on the back of a $600 million deal with Apple that was announced after the quarter closed.  Dialog has agreed to transfer people and patents to Apple that are key to making the power-management chips at the heart of the iPhone. It will brief investors on its strategy as a smaller, but more diversified, business in London on Thursday.  \u201cOur recent agreement with Apple strengthens our long-term partnership and delivers immediate value for shareholders,\u201d CEO Jala Bagherli said in a statement.  Dialog would build its expertise in mixed-signal mobile power applications, Bagherli added, and focus on high-growth segments of the Internet of Things, mobile, automotive and computing and storage markets.  Semiconductor stocks have been hit hard in October by mounting evidence that a turning business cycle and escalating trade tensions will bring an end to a global boom that propelled Samsung to record quarterly profits.  The South Korean electronics giant has called a downturn in the memory chip market. Dialog\u2019s fate is more closely tied to that of Apple, which is expected to account for three-quarters of revenues this year.  Dialog said third-quarter revenues rose 6 percent to $384 million, while underlying operating profits were up 9 percent to $83.7 million, ahead of mean expectations in a poll of analysts.  It forecast fourth-quarter revenues in the range of $430-$470 million, while full-year revenues were seen up 8 percent. Analysts at Baader Helvea described the results as solid and said the outlook was above consensus.  Dialog also said it would launch a buyback of 100-150 million euros of its stock.

REUTERS\/Gonzalo Fuentes  The phones will let the researchers run any programs on them and give those programs any access to the data on the device, making it easier for outside security experts to probe iOS software.  Apple had promised the initiative a year ago, and the long lead time frustrated some security experts as serious flaws have continued to be discovered.  Specialists have long argued that the opacity of Apple\u2019s devices has not made them more secure than phones running Android and other software - it just made analysis harder.  Those concerns ramped up after Apple sued a company that offered an emulation of iOS on copyright infringement grounds. That case against Corellium is still pending.  Apple has some of the top security talent in the private sector, but its devices have been targeted effectively by national intelligence agencies and some arms contractors.  Smaller companies sell police departments gear that can unlock many devices and download their contents, though those tools are not foolproof.  Apple executives speaking to Reuters before the announcement said they would pick an unannounced number of established researchers to get the first batch of modified phones.  In return, the researchers must pledge to notify Apple of any security holes they find and negotiate time for the company to confirm the issue and release a patch for users to install.  The company said it would also make senior engineers available to discuss issues that arise with the researchers, another step toward increased openness and away from its past secretive policies.","446":"(Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply higher on Monday, fueled by expectations of a coronavirus relief package and by a rally in Amazon, Apple and other technology stocks ahead quarterly earnings season.

In response, Apple said its new rules will not require Facebook to change its \u201capproach to tracking users and creating targeted advertising\u201d but instead requires Facebook to give users on Apple devices a choice of whether to opt in to those practices.  \u201cWe believe that this is a simple matter of standing up for our users. Users should know when their data is being collected and shared across other apps and websites \u2014 and they should have the choice to allow that or not,\u201d Apple said in a statement.  The world\u2019s biggest social media company ran full-page ads in major newspapers criticizing Apple\u2019s plans, which will limit apps\u2019 ability to gather data from people\u2019s phones that can be used for targeted advertising.  It said in a blog post that Apple's own personalized ad platform would be exempt from the new prompt requirement the iPhone maker is planning to impose on other companies. (Blog: bit.ly\/2KxevfP)  Apple said in June that such activity will require a pop-up notification asking iOS users for \u201cpermission to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies,\u201d which digital advertising firms expect most will decline.  Levy said that although Facebook disagreed with Apple\u2019s approach, it would comply with the new rules and display a prompt. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a choice if we want our app to be available in the App Store,\u201d he said.  He declined to say whether Facebook would take any action to push back against the policy.  Facebook and Apple have also tangled over commission fees the iPhone maker charges apps listed on iOS devices, with Facebook again aligning itself with small developers most affected by the policy.  Opposition against Apple continued to grow on Wednesday as Digital Content Next, a digital media trade association representing members such as The New York Times and The Washington Post, said it had joined the Coalition for App Fairness.  The nonprofit, which includes members like Epic Games and Spotify, is calling on regulators around the world to fight \u201canticompetitive\u201d app store practices such as Apple\u2019s 30% revenue cut on purchases made within apps.  Facebook previously tried to push a notification to its users about Apple\u2019s fees but said Apple rejected its \u201ctransparency notice.\u201d  Facebook said in a blog post that it was \u201ccommitted to providing relevant information\u201d in a federal antitrust lawsuit filed by Epic Games challenging the commission fee rules, but declined to specify how it would participate in the litigation.

Thousands of contract workers gathered on the grounds of the Wistron site on the outskirts of India\u2019s tech hub of Bengaluru on Saturday demanding unpaid wages and better working hours.  As police arrived, the crowd turned violent and video from the scene showed people armed with rods and sticks smashing equipment and vandalizing cars, causing what the company estimated at $60 million in damage.  \u201cWe have teams on the ground and have immediately launched a detailed investigation at Wistron\u2019s Narasapura facility,\u201d Apple said in an email, adding it was dedicated to ensuring everyone in its supply chain was treated with dignity and respect.  Apple said it was sending staff and auditors to the site and was cooperating with police in their investigation.  Wistron, one of Apple\u2019s top global suppliers, said in a regulatory filing in Taiwan it \u201calways abides by the law, and fully supports and is cooperating with relevant authorities\u201d.  Wistron has been making iPhones in India for nearly four years and its operation has been seen as a success story for Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government that is looking to boost manufacturing.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  \u201cThe incident hurts the \u2018Make in India\u2019 label,\u201d said independent brand consultant Harish Bijoor, referring to the government promotion campaign slogan. \u201cSuch events are small scars left on India as a manufacturing facility.\u201d  Apple, under the leadership of Tim Cook, has been looking to not only step up its marketing and presence in India - one of the biggest smartphone markets in the world - but also expand its sourcing footprint in the South Asian nation.  A minister for the state of Karnataka, where the factory is located, said the government was talking to all parties and that the labour department was investigating any underpayment of wages and non-clearance of other dues.  The unrest comes as Modi\u2019s government is under pressure from protesting farmers opposed to reforms in the agricultural sector, which they say threaten their livelihoods.  MILLIONS IN DAMAGES  Videos taken by employees in the Wistron factory showed men, many wearing masks due to the coronavirus outbreak, destroying security cameras, windows and other equipment.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  The crowd smashed four cars, two golf carts, stole laptops and smartphones and destroyed other office equipment, according to a police report filed by Wistron and reviewed by Reuters.  In the complaint, Wistron accused more than 5,000 contract workers and some 2,000 unknown people of destruction of property. It put the losses at 4.38 billion rupees ($60 million).  Police have arrested 149 people over the violence, a senior officer said, while a search was on to identify and arrest more perpetrators as the investigation continues.  Trade union leader M.D. Harigovind said the violence was a direct result of the \u201cbrutal exploitation of workers and sweatshop like conditions\u201d.  Wistron, whose workers are not unionized, did not respond to questions seeking comment on the allegations, but said in a statement earlier it was \u201cdeeply shocked\u201d by the violence it blamed on \u201cunknown persons ... with unclear intentions\u201d.","457":"(Reuters) - Apple supplier Skyworks Solutions Inc SWKS.O forecast current-quarter revenue below estimates on Thursday as global smartphone demand slows and U.S. restrictions on customer ZTE weigh, overshadowing better-than-expected second-quarter results.  Skyworks, whose radio frequency chips are used in Apple Inc's AAPL.O iPhone, joins a long list of global suppliers to warn of smartphone weakness that had fueled fears of waning demand for iPhones. However, Apple reported resilient iPhone sales on Tuesday.  Piper Jaffray analyst Harsh Kumar said the company\u2019s forecast miss is mostly because of the action against ZTE.  The hit on revenue from ZTE of about $25 million to $30 million was included in the guidance, Chief Executive Officer Liam Griffin said on a conference call with analysts.  The United States in April banned American firms from selling parts and software to Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp 0763.HK for seven years for violating the sanctions against Iran.  Skyworks said it expects third-quarter revenue in the range of $875 million to $900 million, while analysts were expecting $931.8 million.  Analyst Kumar said the guidance was \u201creally not that bad\u201d as investors expected much worse because of soft trends at Apple.  CEO Griffin said he expected meaningful sequential growth into the fourth quarter and into December following a traditional seasonal pattern for mobile and smartphones.  Strong demand for chips used in network gear, connected devices and automobiles helped Skyworks top estimates for second-quarter profit and revenue.  The company\u2019s net income rose to $276 million, or $1.50 per share, in the three months ended March 30 from $224.9 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier.  Excluding certain items, Skyworks earned $1.64 per share, above estimates of $1.60.  Revenue rose to $913.4 million from $851.7 million, beating estimate of $910.7 million, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.

Raising his share price target for the iPhone maker, analyst Samik Chatterjee argued the company could leverage the millions of users who search its App Store and Safari browser daily to generate the stellar growth seen by Facebook and Google in recent years.

Apple does not currently give detailed figures on advertising revenue.  Through two difficult years for iPhone sales, the California-based firm has stressed the importance of growth in its services segment, which already includes Apple Care and Apple Music and generated revenue of $12.51 billion last quarter.  Along with its highly anticipated launch of its flagship triple-camera iPhone this year, it rolled out a streaming TV service in September in a bid to diversify its revenue streams away from a stagnating smartphone market.  \u201cWhile investors are trying to identify the next big frontier for services, we believe hidden in plain sight and underappreciated by most is the advertising opportunity within Apple\u2019s fingertips,\u201d Chatterjee said.

(Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)","462":"(Reuters) - On Tuesday, Apple Inc will broadcast an event from its Cupertino, California campus and is widely expected to announce new iPhones that can tap 5G wireless data networks.  FILE PHOTO: A logo of Apple is seen outside at the upcoming Apple Marina Bay Sands store in Singapore, September 8, 2020. REUTERS\/Edgar Su  Apple teased the event\u2019s announcement with the tagline \u201cHi, speed,\u201d a possible allusion to the far faster speeds that some variations of 5G can deliver.  Apple is far from the first phone maker to launch 5G phones. Indeed, nearly all of its rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd have 5G models on store shelves already. Apple\u2019s entrance to the fray is likely to bring fresh attention to the technology, even if U.S. carriers are still years away from rolling out the fastest versions.  Here\u2019s a closer look at what analysts expect Apple to announce.  A FLAGSHIP IPHONE FOR PROS  Starting with last year\u2019s iPhone models, Apple forked its iPhone 11 flagship devices into a \u201cPro\u201d variant that packed more cameras and an upgraded screen starting at a $1,000 while the standard flagship cost $700. Analysts expect a similar split this year, with two iPhone \u201cPro\u201d models, one of which could feature a larger screen than last year\u2019s largest \u201cMax\u201d model. Some analysts expect a 3D camera to assist with features like augmented reality, similar to a sensor that Apple put into some iPad models earlier this year. Both iPhone Pro models are likely to have 5G features.  A FLAGSHIP IPHONE FOR EVERYONE ELSE  As with the previous year, analysts expect a plain iPhone 12 model that will likely have cheaper screen technology and fewer cameras, but otherwise retain features from the top-of-the-line model such as new same \u201cA14\u201d processor chips. Look for this model to come in only one size, arrive in the middle of Apple\u2019s pricing range and be the phone Apple promotes as the right choice for most users.  POCKETS OF THE WORLD, REJOICE  Apple\u2019s iPhones have steadily grown in size since their debut in 2007, and the most recent flagships can strain even the roomiest pants pockets. Fans of phones that can be comfortably used with one hand are stuck with Apple\u2019s iPhone SE, whose design harkens back to the 2014 iPhone 6 despite having a newer processor chip.  Analysts this year expect Apple to show a smaller version of its flagship - perhaps called the iPhone 12 Mini - that will have features such as a screen with far smaller bezel but in form factor closer to the iPhone SE.  This model is likely to be Apple\u2019s lowest price flagship, but a major question is whether it will support the fastest variant of 5G called millimeter wave. Millimeter wave technology requires new radio chips that drive up the cost of phones - some Android phones with the feature cost more than their other 5G cousins - and take up space inside the phone.  A SMALLER HOMEPOD  Apple was a late comer to the smart speaker market, launching its HomePod in early 2018, well after rivals Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google had come to dominate the market. Apple has not released an update to the HomePod since then, but analysts expect a smaller, cheaper speaker, possibly called the HomePod Mini, though it is unclear whether Apple will match the $40 price tag for some of Amazon and Google\u2019s smallest speakers.","463":"FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc. logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, New York, U.S., October 16, 2019. REUTERS\/Mike Segar  (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Monday launched an updated version of its MacBook Pro with modified keyboards, as the laptop line had faced criticism for typing-related problems, while boosting performance and adding storage.  Apple said here its new lineup of MacBook Pro, priced at $1,299 and at $1,199 for the education-focused model, was available online.  MacBooks account for 9% of the company\u2019s total revenue.  The new keyboard follows the \u201cscissor\u201d mechanism more commonly found in the industry.  The iPhone maker switched back to the mechanism, discarding the \u201cbutterfly\u201d keyboards, after it received complaints of sticky, unresponsive keys and keystrokes that failed to register when tiny amounts of dust or debris accumulated under or near keys.  The updated version will provide double the storage of its predecessor, with a capacity of up to 1 terabyte.  The company also said the new MacBook Pro will be available in select stores later this week.","464":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O on Wednesday released a smaller iPhone priced at $399, cutting the starting price for the company's smartphone line in a move to broaden its appeal to budget-conscious customers as the coronavirus hobbles the global economy.  The lower-cost model could also attract more consumers to Apple services, a growing driver of revenue. Shares of Apple fell 0.8%, less than the 2.1% decline of the S&P 500 index.  Apple will start taking orders for the phone on its website on Friday, with delivery of devices expected to start April 24.  The iPhone SE will start at $50 less than what was previously the cheapest iPhone available, the iPhone 8, which will be retired. The SE comes with a 4.7-inch display and the same processor chip as Apple\u2019s most advanced phone, the 11 Pro. The SE lacks Apple\u2019s facial recognition system to unlock the device, instead relying on a fingerprint sensor similar to older models. While the new iPhone adds features such as wireless charging and a high-end camera, it lacks connectivity for 5G, the next generation of mobile data networks.  The announcement comes as the United States and much of the world is reeling from the novel coronavirus, although U.S. political leaders have begun to talk about ending stay-at-home orders and restarting the economy, hoping record deaths and falling hospitalizations represent a peak.  Previous iPhones have been unveiled in a polished presentation in front of fans, but large events remain banned in Apple\u2019s home base of Santa Clara County, California, where public officials ordered the first lockdowns in the United States to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.  Apple\u2019s cheaper phone reflects the coronavirus-driven economic downturn and job loss.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Ben Bajarin, principal analyst for consumer market intelligence at Creative Strategies, said that Apple likely realized many customers were buying older models such as the iPhone 8 rather than the newer iPhone 11 Pro at $999, \u201cand a big part of that is probably price.\u201d Those budget-minded iPhone buyers may have been turned off by the iPhone 8\u2019s aging chips and camera.  Apple is \u201caddressing that head-on with a device and price that can still get people on the latest technology,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving a device you\u2019re sure is going to last a long time is exactly what (consumers) want.\u201d  The new aluminum-and-glass SE - which comes in black, white and red, looks much like an iPhone 8.  The cheaper phone enters a cut-throat market for value phones, especially in China, where Apple derives about 17% of sales. In China, rivals such as Xiaomi Corp 1810.HK last month announced models with 5G features starting at about $425.  But Bajarin said buyers interested in 5G may gravitate toward flagship phones, while budget buyers \u201care not people that would give a hoot about 5G.\u201d  With wavering hardware sales, Apple has been investing in subscription services such as its Apple TV+ streaming television service, Apple Music and iCloud. The new SE will come bundled with a one free year of the streaming television service, similar to Apple\u2019s flagship devices released last fall.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cGiven its price tag, (the iPhone SE) is unlikely to be that impactful for Apple\u2019s financials, but could help widen the installed base, which will be helpful long term for Apple\u2019s services revenue,\u201d said James Cordwell, an analyst with Atlantic Equities.  Horace Dediu, an analyst with Asymco, said that budget-minded phone buyers may not pay attention to whether a device has Apple\u2019s latest chips, but third-party app developers do. If more iPhone users have powerful hardware, he said, it could encourage developers to create apps with augmented reality and artificial intelligence that could help the devices stand out against competitors.  The coronavirus has created a volatile start to the year. Sales in China, the first nation hit by the virus, plunged, then rebounded as the country began to reopen. Sales of 500,000 phones in February rose to 2.5 million phones in March, according to government sales data there.  Apple will begin selling the new model online while its stores around the world are closed, except those within its greater China sales region.  Apple gets about 31% of its sales from its elegant stores and website, with 69% coming from partners such as mobile carriers and other retailers.  Apple said partners would decide whether to sell the phones in their physical stores. Many of Apple's resellers are trying to guide customers toward online sales. Major partners such as Best Buy Inc BBY.N have reduced their hours, and AT&T Inc T.N has closed about 40% of its U.S. retail stores.  Best Buy said customers would be able to pre-order the new iPhone on its website and either have it shipped to their home or use the company's curbside pickup option. Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N, which has stopped selling any phones in physical stores, told Reuters on Wednesday that it will not sell the iPhone SE in stores. T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.O did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","465":"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Apple ditched plans to build an 850 million euro ($1 billion) data center in Ireland because of delays in the approval process that have stalled the project for more than three years, the iPhone maker said on Thursday.

Ireland relies on foreign multinational companies like Apple for the creation of one in every 10 jobs across the economy and sees major investments such as data centers as a means of securing their presence in the country.  The government is in the process of amending its planning laws to include data centers as strategic infrastructure, thus allowing them to get through the planning process much more quickly.  A similar Apple center announced at the same time in Denmark was due to begin operations last year and Apple announced in July that it would build its second EU data center there.  \u201cThere is no disputing that Apple\u2019s decision is very disappointing, particularly for Athenry and the West of Ireland,\u201d Ireland\u2019s Minister for Business and Enterprise Heather Humphreys said in a statement.  \u201cThe Government did everything it could to support this investment...

INCJ\u2019s stake will fall to 12.7% from 25.3%.  The consortium reached a basic agreement on the deal in mid-April but delayed formalizing it to reassess Japan Display\u2019s prospects. The reassessment was prompted by a change in Japan Display\u2019s financial situation, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters at the time.  Soon after the delay, INCJ offered to forgive 44.7 billion yen in debt in return for Japan Display\u2019s 27.2% stake in OLED panel maker JOLED, Japan Display said on Thursday.  Reuters could not reach INCJ for immediate comment.  Japan Display also on Thursday said \u201ca client\u201d to which it owed money had agreed to halving the pace of repayment for two years.  People with direct knowledge of the matter previously told Reuters that Apple fronted most of the $1.5 billion cost of building a Japan Display plant four years ago, with the Japanese firm agreeing to repay Apple with a percentage of screen sales.  A Japan Display executive in April said the firm still owed its client about 100 billion yen, without naming Apple.  Apple did not respond to an emailed request for comment.","469":"TOKYO, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Japan\u2019s Nikkei rose for a third straight day on Tuesday as investors tiptoed back into equities amid signs of a slight easing of trade tensions between the United States and China.  Hopes for fresh stimulus moves by major economies also boosted riskier assets.  On Monday, Washington extended a reprieve that permits China\u2019s Huawei Technologies to buy components from U.S. companies by 90 days, to supply existing customers.  The Nikkei share average rose 0.6% to 20,677.22 points, while the broader Topix added 0.8% to 1,506.77.  \u201cIt\u2019s like an extension of yesterday\u2019s rally -- largely buoyed by short-covering although the moves seemed to lack strong conviction,\u201d said a Tokyo-based investment manager.  Investors were growing cautious ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s Jackson Hole symposium and G7 (Group of Seven) summit later in the week, he said.  On Wall Street, all three major stock indexes gained overnight, with Apple jumping 1.9% to provide the biggest boost to the Nasdaq.  That helped Tokyo-listed Apple suppliers, with Taiyo Yuden and TDK Corp rising 1.6% and Foster Electric advancing 1.4%.  After speaking with Apple\u2019s chief executive Tim Cook on Sunday, U.S President Donald Trump said the CEO \u201cmade a good case\u201d that tariffs could hurt Apple, given that Samsung\u2019s products would not be subject to those same tariffs.  Tokyo-listed chipmaking-related firms also got a boost after the U.S. Philadelphia semiconductor index climbed 1.9% on Monday as Huawei\u2019s U.S. chip suppliers, such as Micron Technology, rose.  Semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker Screen Holdings surged 5.4% and chipmaking equipment supplier Tokyo Electron rallied 1.4%.  Rate-sensitive TSE REIT index rose 0.3%, extending its winning streak to an eighth day to hit its fresh 12-year highs since 2007.  Real estate was the best performing sector among the Tokyo market\u2019s 33 subindexes, with both Mitsui Fudosan and Mitsubishi Estate up 1.7%.  Hopes for additional stimulus helped sentiment after media reports said Germany is prepared to increase fiscal spending, and after the People\u2019s Bank of China took steps to lower corporate borrowing costs by setting a new lending reference rate.  Turnover on the Tokyo Stock Exchange\u2019s main board was thin at 1.58 trillion yen, well below its daily average of 2.33 trillion yen over the past year.

The tech company\u2019s stock jumped 2.8 percent, bringing its gain to about 9 percent since Tuesday when it reported June-quarter results above expectations and said it bought back $20 billion of its own shares.

Global financial markets felt the shockwaves as Apple shares logged their biggest intra-day percentage fall in six years, sending the company\u2019s stock market value to under $700 billion, well below its $1.1 trillion October peak.  After Apple\u2019s first revenue warning in nearly 12 years, investors also dumped chipmakers and tech stocks and flocked to perceived safe havens like U.S. Treasuries and the Japanese yen. [MKTS\/GLOB] Developments in a patent dispute between Apple and Qualcomm in Germany also rattled investors.  A senior White House economic adviser said he expected trade uncertainty to hit earnings at many U.S. companies, but that sales at Apple and others with large exposure to China would recover once Washington and Beijing strike a trade deal.  \u201cThat is having an impact on earnings and it\u2019s not going to be just Apple,\u201d White House Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers Kevin Hassett said in an interview with CNN.  \u201cI think there are a heck of a lot of U.S. companies that have a lot of sales in China that are basically going to be watching their earnings be downgraded next year.\u201d  Economic deceleration in China had caught Apple off guard and trade tensions between Washington and Beijing were starting to hurt consumer spending on smartphones in China, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said on Wednesday.  Cook in November had cited slowing growth in emerging markets such as Brazil, India and Russia when Apple gave first-quarter sales estimates that were lower than expected. But he said then that he \u201cwould not put China in that category\u201d of countries with troubled growth.  The China slowdown comes as Apple faces other obstacles in some of its biggest markets.  Qualcomm Inc said it had posted security bonds to enforce a court order banning sale of some iPhone models in Germany, meaning Apple would likely have to pull iPhone 7 and 8 models from its 15 stores in the country.  The German case, part of a global patent spat between the two companies, is Qualcomm\u2019s third major effort to secure a ban on iPhones over patent-infringement allegations after similar moves in the United States and China.  Wall Street analysts scrambled to cut their price targets on Apple, with at least 27 lowering their estimates. The current median price target is $186.  Shares of U.S.-based Apple suppliers and chipmakers including Cirrus Logic Inc, Skyworks Solutions Inc, Analog Devices, Broadcom Inc, NXP Semiconductors NV and Micron Technology Inc all tumbled.  Apple company logos are seen as two MacBooks stand next to each other in an office in Vienna, Austria January 3, 2019. REUTERS\/Leonhard Foeger  Many analysts and investors had worried about a slowdown in iPhone sales since the company said in November it would stop disclosing unit sales data for its phones and other hardware products.  Apple\u2019s latest comments fueled worries that its relatively high-priced devices may be falling out of favor in China, where rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] offer cheaper options.  Peter Richardson, a research director at Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Research, said it was difficult to see a catalyst that would help Apple recover lost ground in China.  \u201cUntil it changes this pricing strategy, it is unlikely to see market share growth and will most likely see a gradual contraction as iPhone users upgrade at slower rates,\u201d said Richardson.  Apple on Wednesday lowered its revenue forecast to $84 billion for its first quarter ended Dec. 29, below analysts\u2019 estimate of $88.05 billion. Apple originally forecast revenue of between $89 billion and $93 billion.  Apple shares were down 9.8 percent at $142.40.

Trump backed off his Sept. 1 deadline for 10% tariffs on all Chinese goods not yet subject to them, delaying duties on cellphones, laptops and other consumer goods, in the hopes of blunting their impact on U.S. holiday sales.  In the U.S., shares of likely beneficiaries of the delay soared overnight, with Apple Inc up 4.2% on news that its iPhone, tablet and laptop computer products would be included in the items list, while the Philadelphia semiconductor index gained 3.0%.

June 4 (Reuters) - Apple Inc will ask developers to position a new \u201cSign on with Apple\u201d button in iPhone and iPad apps above rival buttons from Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Facebook Inc, according to design guidelines released this week.  The move to give Apple prime placement is significant because users often select the default or top option on apps. And Apple will require apps to offer its button if they want to offer options to login with Facebook or Google.  Apple unveiled its login button on Monday, emphasizing users\u2019 privacy and also introducing a feature that randomly generates an email address to avoid revealing the person\u2019s true email.  Many consumers choose to sign in to independent apps using their accounts from Google or Facebook because it saves the trouble of having to create and remember separate user names and passwords for dozens of different apps.  But the login buttons can send some data back to their makers about the user\u2019s app habits. Apple\u2019s software chief Craig Federighi said during a keynote address on Monday that Apple was seeking to give users a more private option and developers a way to offer a fast one-step login without sending their user\u2019s data to another company.  Apple\u2019s guidelines do not appear to impose requirements on apps that have their own dedicated login system and do not use third-party buttons from Google or Facebook, such as apps from game maker Nintendo Co Ltd. Apple\u2019s button also works on websites. Its use will not be required because Apple does not hold review power over websites the way it does apps on its own store, but Apple\u2019s guidelines still ask it to be given top placement if it is used.  Apple declined to comment further beyond its executives\u2019 public remarks on Sign in with Apple. Facebook and Google declined to comment on the move, though Google said it does not require use of Google\u2019s login button for apps in its Play Store on Android devices.  Apple\u2019s guidelines to developers around login tools come as developers and rivals have alleged that some of its App Store practices, such as taking a commission of up to 30% of sales made through the store, are anticompetitive.  United States antitrust regulators are also laying the ground for a potential antitrust review of Apple and other major technology companies, Reuters reported Monday. In an interview with CBS News that aired on Tuesday, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said it was \u201cfair\u201d for regulators to scrutinize Apple given its size but said the company is not a monopoly in any of the markets it operates in.","481":"The logo of Apple company is seen outside an Apple store in Bordeaux, France, March 22, 2019.

Berkshire boosted its Goldman stake by 21 percent, owning roughly 13.3 million shares worth $2.92 billion on June 30, up from 11 million shares on March 31.

Georgia became the first state to push ahead with its plan to allow an array of small businesses to reopen on Friday despite disapproval from President Donald Trump and health experts.  Investors may be overestimating how quickly U.S. businesses can go back to normal, and the S&P 500 could fall 5% or more as it becomes evident that resuming normal economic activity may not happen for months, warned Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in North Carolina.  \u201cWe think this is likely to be a little bit of a sideways market, and we won\u2019t be surprised to see a bit of downside before we see more upside,\u201d Freedman said.  Overall, analysts still expect a 15% decline in S&P 500 first-quarter earnings, with profits for the energy sector estimated to slump more than 60%, raising fears of debt defaults, layoffs and possible bankruptcies.  New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly rose in March, but the gains are not likely to be sustainable amid the pandemic, which has abruptly shut down the economy and contributed to a collapse in crude oil prices.  The CBOE volatility index, known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, was down for the third straight session.  At 2:28 pm ET (1828 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.55% at 23,643.48 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.84% to 2,821.41.  The Nasdaq Composite added 1.05% to 8,583.87.  Verizon Communications Inc declined 0.4% after it lost 68,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill in the first quarter.  American Express Co dipped 0.9% after posting a 76% drop in first-quarter profit as the credit card issuer braced for potential losses stemming from the coronavirus outbreak.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.28-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.44-to-1 ratio favored advancers.  The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 29 new highs and 11 new lows.

FILE PHOTO: The popular video game \"Fortnite\" by Epic Games is pictured on a screen in this picture illustration August 14, 2020. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/Illustration  On Thursday Epic filed a lawsuit in federal court after Apple pulled \u201cFortnite\u201d from its App Store to punish Epic for implementing a payment mechanism that bypassed Apple\u2019s practice of taking a 30% commission on in-app purchases.  The suit seeks a court order ending Apple\u2019s commission structure and forcing Apple to allow users to install software on iPhones outside the confines of the App Store. Epic also sued Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, but the case is different because Android phones allow app installs outside its Play Store.  Epic is not the first to sue over the App Store. Consumers have filed suit alleging Apple\u2019s practices raise software prices. Developers in another suit have argued that software for iOS, the iPhone\u2019s operating system, is its own market but also made extensive alternative arguments.  Epic\u2019s lawsuit relies almost completely on the one argument that Apple\u2019s iOS app distribution and in-app payment systems are their own markets. It also goes further to argue that Apple purposely created those markets by building an \u201cecosystem\u201d of devices and services meant to favor Apple products.  \u201cA customer choosing to purchase or switch to a non-Apple device loses access to these services, leading to increased costs a customer must face when choosing to leave Apple\u2019s ecosystem,\u201d Epic wrote.  Apple on Friday declined to comment on Epic\u2019s suit.  Its primary defense in the past when confronted with allegations of anticompetitive practices is that it does not have a majority share of the global smartphone market.  \u201cApple does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business,\u201d Chief Executive Tim Cook told the U.S. House Judiciary Committee during a hearing on competition in digital markets in July.  The defense is factually accurate. iPhones and Macs have much lower global market share than Android and Windows devices, and Apple executives often say that consumers can access whatever software they desire on those competing devices or via the web browser on iPhones.  But if a federal court accepts the argument that the iOS app distribution and in-app payment markets are distinct, the implications could be profound, said John M. Newman, an associate professor at the University of Miami School of Law.  The relevant market would not be \u201capps for smartphones\u201d where Apple has a small global share compared to Android, but rather \u201capps for iPhones\u201d where Apple has much more power.  A landmark case against Microsoft Corp in the 1990s established that taking actions that make it harder for consumers to get applications from developers - even if consumers can still ultimately access the applications with extra work - could be grounds for an antitrust claim, he said.  If a court agrees that Apple controls the market for iOS app distribution, that could make Apple vulnerable to Epic\u2019s claims of illegal \u201ctying\u201d of two products together by requiring the use of Apple\u2019s in-app payment system to be allowed in the App Store.  \u201cIt sounds like the weirdest and most arcane part of the case, but it actually may be the simplest from a legal perspective,\u201d Newman said.","489":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  DUBLIN (Reuters) - A worker at Apple\u2019s European headquarters in Cork in Ireland has tested positive for coronavirus, one of 24 cases reported so far in the country where its oldest university, Trinity College, has been forced to move all lectures online.  The virus has yet to spread as quickly in Ireland as other European countries, but the government has canceled all St. Patrick\u2019s Day parades due to take place across the country next week to limit the impact. The government has also set aside 3 billion euros to tackle the infection.  Apple, which is one of Ireland\u2019s largest multinational employers, said the employee who tested positive is now in self-isolation and that they feel the risk to others is low while they coordinate closely with local health authorities.  Apple employs 6,000 workers in Ireland\u2019s second largest city of Cork. The iPhone maker said in a statement that it had asked some workers to stay at home as a precaution and that it was continuing to regularly deep clean all its offices and stores.  In Dublin, Trinity College said lectures would be delivered online for the rest of the academic year to May 31, with tutorials, seminars and laboratory practicals continuing using social distancing protocol.  A floor in one of the 428-year old university\u2019s buildings was closed as a precautionary measure last week after it was informed of a positive case within the city-center campus.  In a further blow to Dublin\u2019s tourism sector, Trinity said it would also close its Book of Kells exhibition. The ancient illuminated manuscript book created by Celtic monks in about 800 AD is one of Ireland\u2019s top tourist attractions.  The closure is one of the first such coronavirus-related measures implemented in the country.","490":"Nov 10 (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday is expected to introduce Mac computers with its own processor chips, marking the start of its move away from Intel Corp\u2019s chips.  Apple said in June that it would begin outfitting Macs with its own chips, which will build on its decade-long history of designing processors for its iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches.  The new chips, which will be unveiled in a webcast event on Tuesday, will make it far easier for the millions of apps currently available for iPhones to migrate to Macs, which have been overshadowed by smart phones.  Apple\u2019s phone chips draw on computing architecture technology from Arm Ltd and manufactured by outside partners such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp, or TSMC.  The new \u201cApple Silicon\u201d chips will mark a departure from Intel, whose chips Apple has used since 2006, when it successfully transitioned away from chips made by International Business Machines Corp. Intel has disclosed delays with its internal chipmaking operations that have caused it to fall behind TSMC in making smaller, more power-efficient chips.  Power efficiency - that is, getting the most computing done per watt of energy consumed - is one of Apple\u2019s key aims.  \u201cNormally, to get more performance you have to consume more power,\u201d Johny Srouji, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of hardware technologies, said at an event announcing the chips in June. \u201cOur plan is to give the Mac a much higher level of performance, while at the same time consuming less power.\u201d  Microsoft Corp and Qualcomm Corp have been working together for four years to bring Arm-based Windows laptops to market, with major makers such as Lenovo Group Ltd , Asustek Computer and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd offering machines.  But for both Microsoft and Apple, the true test is whether software developers embrace Arm-based laptops. Apple is hoping that the massive group of iPhone developers will embrace the new Macs, which will share a common 64-bit Arm computing architecture with the iPhone and be able to use similar apps.  In the meantime, Apple has seen a boom in Mac sales due to the coronavirus pandemic, notching record fiscal fourth quarter Mac sales of $9 billion earlier this month - all of them Intel-based. In June, Chief Executive Tim Cook said Apple will continue to support those devices for \u201cyears to come\u201d but did not specify an end-of-life date.

Amazon rose by 4.7 percent at one point, putting its market capitalization at $865.0 billion. At the same time, Apple traded up 2.1 percent, giving it a market capitalization of $864.8 billion.  Microsoft, which on Friday closed above Apple\u2019s market capitalization for the first time in eight years, was up 0.9 percent, leaving its stock market value at $859.0 billion, third in the group.  Amazon\u2019s lead lasted only a few seconds. At the close, Apple was back on top with a 3.49 percent increase in its stock that put its total value at $877 billion. It was followed by Amazon, up 4.86 percent with a market capitalization of $866.6 billion, and then Microsoft, up 1.08 percent and a stock market value of $860.4 billion.  The tight race between the trio of high-powered technology stocks coincided with a broad stock market rally after the United States and China agreed on a temporary truce in their ongoing trade dispute.  Apple in August became the first U.S. publicly listed company to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization, but its share price has fallen sharply in recent months as investors worried that demand for iPhones was losing steam.  Its market capitalization overtook Microsoft\u2019s in 2010 as Microsoft struggled with slow demand for personal computers, due in part to the explosion of smartphones like the iPhone.  Amazon\u2019s stock has recovered most of the ground it lost after the online retailer in October forecast disappointing sales for the holiday quarter.  Although it is down about 13 percent from its Sept. 4 record-high close, in the year to date Amazon\u2019s stock is up 51 percent, compared with a 31 percent rise for Microsoft and Apple\u2019s 9 percent increase.","492":"(Reuters) - Global smartphone production is expected to slump a record 16.5% to 287 million phones in the June quarter from a year earlier as the coronavirus pandemic muzzles demand, TrendForce said here, despite supply chains resuming after weeks of shutdown.

The volatile give-and-take during the week and quarter would seem to set the table for tense months ahead as buy-the-dip bulls look for corporate earnings to validate the market\u2019s current levels and short-selling bears work to expose investors\u2019 complacency.  Yet David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co\u2019s funds division, said he is optimistic that markets have clarified the effects of a large U.S. tax cut and the prospect for higher interest rates, factors he says challenged markets during the first quarter.  \u201cIt\u2019s not that the uncertainties have gone away on higher rates or lower taxes, but I think we\u2019ve grown accustomed to them, and that should lay a foundation for investors to put more money to work,\u201d he said.

A \u201cmelt-up\u201d that sent the MSCI\u2019s \u201call-country\u201d world share index up more than 7 percent in January suddenly melted away as tensions over global trade escalated, turmoil deepened in the White House and market-leading technology firms wobbled on fears of regulation and other issues. The index is down more than 1 percent in price terms this year.  Now, the Dow, S&P 500, FTSE, Nikkei and scores of other major indexes are all also down for the year.

Nine people have died.  The virus, which health officials have said can be passed from person to person, has spread to cities including Beijing and Shanghai, with cases have been confirmed in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, as well as Taiwan.  Taiwan is not a member of the WHO due to the objection of China, which considers the island a Chinese province with no right to participate in international organizations unless it accepts it is part of China.  Tsai, speaking to reporters after Taiwan\u2019s Tuesday confirmation of its first case of the coronavirus, a woman returning to Taiwan from Wuhan, said China had to live up to its international obligations.

Bob O\u2019Donnell, chief of TECHnalysis Research, said Apple\u2019s move to block steam could hurt it with users between 18 and 24 years old, more than half of whom have iPhones, according to his research.  \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is denying iPhone owners access to the most important gaming ecosystem there is,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven that the younger demographic skews toward iPhones, it seems particularly damaging.\u201d  Steam did not give a precise reason for the App Store denials, saying only that Apple cited \u201cbusiness conflicts with app guidelines.\u201d But the conflict likely centers on what are known as in-app purchases or micro-transactions, in which gamers can spend small sums of money inside games to buy tokens, extra lives or others so-called digital goods.  Lombardi said Steam disabled purchasing its iOS app but did not elaborate on how the change was made.  Apple takes a 30 percent cut of such purchases made within apps distributed through its App Store. Analysts believe those purchases are among the primary drivers of revenue in Apple\u2019s services business, which includes the App Store, iCloud and Apple Music. In Apple\u2019s most recent quarter, services revenue hit $9.1 billion, beating Wall Street expectations and providing a bright spot for revenue growth as the smartphone market matures. [nL1N1S81KI]  Steam, however, also offers purchases within games distributed through its platform and also takes a cut of those purchases.

Epic Games and Apple were not immediately available for comment on the ruling.  Last month, Epic Games had filed for a preliminary injunction that would put its game back in the App Store and restore its developer account after the iPhone maker terminated Epic Games\u2019 account on its App Store.  Epic sued Apple in August, claiming that the company\u2019s 30% commission on some in-app purchases made through its App Store, combined with Apple\u2019s controls over what apps users can download to their iPhones, constituted anticompetitive behavior. The lawsuit came after Epic rolled out its own payment system in the popular Fortnite video game.  Apple does not allow such alternative payment systems and removed Fortnite from the App Store and threatened to terminate Epic\u2019s developer accounts, which would have affected Epic\u2019s other business of selling software used to create games.  Epic moved to stop Apple from taking both steps.

The Cupertino, California-based company says the robot is part of its plan to become a \u201cclosed-loop\u201d manufacturer that does not rely on the mining industry, an aggressive goal that some industry analysts have said is impossible.  Inside a nondescript warehouse on the outskirts of Austin, Texas, Apple\u2019s Daisy robot has been designed to break apart iPhones so that 14 minerals, including lithium, can be extracted and recycled.  Apple is already using recycled aluminum, tin, cobalt and rare earths in some of its products, with plans to add to that list in coming years.  Daisy, less than 20 yards in length, uses a four-step process to remove an iPhone\u2019s battery with a blast of -80 Celsius (-176 Fahrenheit) degree air, and then pop out screws and modules, including the haptic monitor that makes a phone vibrate.  The components are then sent off to recyclers for the minerals to be extracted and refined. Daisy can tear apart 200 iPhones per hour. In 2017, the robot in Austin processed 1 million iPhones, Apple said.  Apple chose the iPhone to be the first of its products that Daisy would disassemble because of its mass popularity, said Lisa Jackson, the company\u2019s head of environment, policy and social initiatives.  Apple is considering sharing the Daisy technology with others, including electric automakers. Daisy does have its skeptics, including many in the tech world who see it primarily as a public relations stunt.  \u201cThere\u2019s this ego that believes they can get all their minerals back, and it\u2019s not possible,\u201d said Kyle Wiens, chief executive of iFixit, a firm dedicated to repairing rather than discarding iPhones and other electronics.  That may partially explain why the mining industry isn\u2019t worried.  \u201cApple is in an enviable position, because they can do this,\u201d said Tom Butler, president of the International Council on Mining and Metals, an industry trade group. \u201cNot everyone else will be able to follow suit.\u201d  Many mining executives also note that with the rising popularity of electric vehicles, newly mined minerals will be needed in even larger scale, a reality that Apple acknowledges.  \u201cWe\u2019re not necessarily competing with the folks who mine,\u201d said Apple\u2019s Jackson, who ran the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under President Barack Obama. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing for miners to fear in this development.\u201d (Reporting by Ernest Scheyder and Stephen Nellis; Editing by Andrea Ricci)","510":"June 11 (Reuters) - Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook said on Thursday the iPhone maker will increase spending with black-owned partners in its supply chain and seek to increase minority representation among the firms it does business with.

Apple\u2019s unveiling of three new iPhones in California met with a limp reaction on Wednesday from analysts and on social media in China, where the U.S. giant has been losing ground to competitors in recent years.  \u201cMore competitive aggressive pricing and a better camera would be its selling points, but the market is still full of challenges, both market competition and macroeconomic factors,\u201d said Will Wong, who tracks China\u2019s phone market at research firm IDC.  The iPhone 11 will have two back cameras, including an ultra wide-angle lens and the next generation of microchips, the A13. Prices start at $699, down from last year\u2019s new iPhone that started at $749. Apple also dropped the price of last year\u2019s equivalent model iPhone XR by $150.  The more expensive iPhone 11 Pro will have three cameras on the back and starts at $999. The bigger screen iPhone 11 Pro Max starts at $1,099.  As anticipated, none will be fifth generation-enabled, which puts the phones a step behind 5G models already released by Huawei Technologies and smaller rival Vivo.  \u201cSince we still have to wait a year for 5G, why not just buy Huawei on Monday,\u201d said one user on China\u2019s Twitter-like service Weibo.  One meme doing the rounds on social media featured Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook bragging about the new features and Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei\u2019s consumer business group, shutting him down by pointing out that Huawei has had those features for years.  When it came to features, one of the main draws of the new launch for U.S. buyers - a $5 per month Netflix-like streaming service - will not be available in China.  PRICE COMPETITION  Apple\u2019s share of the China market in the June quarter fell to 5.8% from 6.4% in the year earlier period, according to research firm Canalys, as Huawei experienced a surge in support from Chinese consumers after the brand was caught up in a trade war between the United States and China.  Counterpoint analyst Neil Shah said the entry price, while lowered by Apple, remains high compared to local rivals. Combined with the lack of 5G, that made the new iPhones \u201cless attractive and future-proof\u201d for Chinese consumers, Shah said, forecasting that Apple will sell 30-35 million iPhones in China this year, down from 63 million phones in 2015.  Still, some analysts said that Apple\u2019s decision to lower the entry price for the new iPhone, one of the most discussed topics on Weibo on Wednesday, was a positive sign.  \u201cWe think the lower iPhone 11 price point and trade-in program will help promote upgrades, specifically in China, while the Apple Arcade and TV+ offerings will hep accelerate services growth,\u201d CFRA analyst Angelo Zino said in a research note.

China placed curbs on travel and asked residents to avoid public places in late January, just ahead of the Lunar New Year festival, a major gift-giving holiday. Those restrictions stayed largely in place through most of February.  In total, mobile phone brands sold a total of 6.34 million devices in February in China, down 54.7% from 14 million in the same month last year, data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology showed (CAICT).  It was also the lowest level for February since at least 2012, when CAICT started publishing data.  Shares of the iPhone maker fell about 6% amid a broader slump in Wall Street on rising fears of a recession due to a steep fall in oil prices and the fast-spreading virus.  \u201cWhile this is very nervous time...we caution that Chinese demand in the March quarter is not the trend, but a \u201cshock event\u201d that we believe will be short lived,\u201d Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note.  Android brands, which include devices made by Huawei Technologies AAPL.O and Xiaomi 1810.HK, accounted for most of the drop, as they collectively saw shipments decline from 12.72 million units in February 2019 to 5.85 million, the data showed.  Shipments of Apple devices slumped to 494,000, from 1.27 million in February 2019. In January, its shipments had held steady at just over 2 million.  Research firms IDC and Canalys previously forecast that overall smartphone shipments would drop by about 40% in the first quarter as the virus outbreak hit demand and disrupted supply chains.  Apple\u2019s branded stores in China were shut for at least two weeks in February as fears over the epidemic mounted.  The company\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, wrote a letter to investors that month warning it would not meet its initial revenue guidance for the current quarter due to weak demand.","520":"(Recasts, adds detail, byline)  * Nov orders +29.7% y\/y vs +13.4% in Reuters poll  * Orders from China +23.3% y\/y; U.S. +30.6% y\/y  * Ministry sees Dec orders between +29% and +32.5% y\/y  * Says outlook very strong, but warns of pandemic uncertainty  TAIPEI, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Taiwan\u2019s export orders rose for the ninth consecutive month in November and at the quickest pace in a decade, boosted by continued strong global demand for the island\u2019s technology products, with Apple Inc rolling out a new iPhone.  Export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, jumped 29.7% from a year earlier to $57.78 billion in November, Ministry of Economic Affairs data showed on Monday.  The highest monthly figure on record represented the fastest rate of growth since May 2010 and far exceeded the 13.4% rise projected in a Reuters poll.  The ministry said orders were helped by \u201chot sales\u201d of new smartphones, as well as continued robust demand for technology to support remote working and learning during the pandemic.  Orders for telecommunications products rose 22.3% on year to $20.8 billion, also a record monthly high, largely attributable to new smartphones and gaming consoles coming to market and work-from-home demand, the ministry added.  Taiwanese companies such as Foxconn and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) are key suppliers to Apple, which in September launched its next-generation iPhone 12.  Taiwan usually sees strong electronics orders in the third and fourth quarters, when vendors launch new smartphone models ahead of holiday demand.  The ministry expects export orders to rise between 29% and 32.5% in December, fuelled by new consumer electronics products from leading global brands, though it warned of uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and continued concern over U.S.-China trade tensions.  U.S. orders in November rose 30.6% from a year earlier, compared with a 17.1% jump in October, while orders from China were up 23.3% versus a 10.7% gain the previous month.  European orders soared by 50.2% while those from Japan were up 25.3%.  Taiwan\u2019s economy is expected to grow by 2.54% in 2020, the slowest in four years but far better than many of its regional peers, as rebounding exports and consumer confidence counter the impact from the coronavirus crisis.

The iPhone maker in November committed the funding to address what Chief Executive Tim Cook called a housing \u201caffordability crisis that is existential\u201d for many residents of the company\u2019s home state.  The majority of the first $400 million to be spent this year is going toward two programs Apple is working on with the California Housing Finance Agency. Under the first, Apple has provided funding to help state officials extend their ability to finance affordable housing projects with tax-exempt bonds.  Under the second, Apple has worked through the agency to help provide mortgage and down payment assistance to hundreds of first-time home buyers to date. The mortgage assistance program is aimed at low- and moderate-income first-time home buyers.  Apple said that it is also working with a public-private group called Housing Trust Silicon Valley to start work on four projects in the San Francisco Bay area that will create 250 new units of affordable housing, many of them reserved for veterans, the homeless or formerly homeless, and residents with developmental disabilities.  Apple is also providing funding to a public-private group called Destination: Home, addressing Silicon Valley\u2019s homelessness crisis. The two said Apple support has helped fund 1,000 new units of housing, including a 70-unit project in Santa Clara designed for seniors experiencing homelessness or at risk of it. The Apple funding also helped expand a program that the group said helped keep 1,500 families from losing their homes.  \u201cWe were able to immediately invest their funding into several new housing developments that will provide a permanent home to vulnerable residents across the region and reinforce our homelessness prevention system at a time when we\u2019re seeing an unprecedented number of at-risk families in need,\u201d Jennifer Loving, Destination: Home\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.","524":"(Reuters) - Most Android phones will have to wait until 2019 to duplicate the 3D sensing feature behind Apple\u2019s Face ID security, three major parts producers have told Reuters, handicapping Samsung and others on a technology that is set to be worth billions in revenue over the next few years.  FILE PHOTO: Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam\/File Photo  The development of new features for the estimated 1.5 billion smart phones shipped annually has been at the heart of the battle for global market share over the past decade, with Apple, bolstered by its huge R&D budget, often leading.  When the iPhone 5S launched with a fingerprint-sensing home button in September 2013, for example, it took its biggest rival Samsung until just April of the next year to deliver its own in the Galaxy S5, with others following soon after.  The 3D sensing technology is expected to enhance the next generation of phones, enabling accurate facial recognition as well as secure biometrics for payments, gesture sensing, and immersive shopping and gaming experiences.  Tech research house Gartner predicts that by 2021, 40 percent of smartphones will be equipped with 3D cameras, which can also be used for so-called augmented reality, or AR, in which digital objects cling tightly to images of the real world.  \u201cThis kind of functionality is going to be very important for AR,\u201d said Gartner analyst Jon Erensen. \u201cI think that is something where you don\u2019t want to get left behind.\u201d  According to parts manufacturers Viavi Solutions Inc, Finisar Corp and Ams AG, bottlenecks on key parts will mean mass adoption of 3D sensing will not happen until next year, disappointing earlier expectations.  That means that China\u2019s Huawei, Xiaomi and others could be a total of almost two years behind Apple, which launched Face ID with its iPhone X anniversary phone last September.  In particular, Android producers are struggling to source vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, or VCSELs, a core part of Apple\u2019s Face ID hardware.  \u201cIt is going to take them a lot of time, the Android-based customers, to secure capacity throughout the whole supply chain,\u201d said Bill Ong, senior director of investor relations from Viavi, seen as the only major supplier of optical filters needed for the 3D sensing modules.  \u201cWe may have a potential introduction of a second handset maker into 3D sensing at the end of this calendar year. (But) the volumes would be very low. In 2019 you clearly will see at least two or more android-based phones,\u201d he added.  Ong declined to name the company that might launch an Android phone with 3D face recognition this year but said that Viavi was in talks with all the major smart phone makers to supply the filters.  Some Android phones with 3D sensing capabilities have hit the market in small numbers, such as the Asus ZenFone AR released last year, but those models didn\u2019t use the sensors for facial recognition like the iPhone X does.  Apple, Huawei and Xiaomi all declined to comment, as did Samsung, whose current phones use a standard camera for facial recognition.  FIREPOWER  Apple\u2019s effort to get ahead with the technology is the latest evidence of an aggressive approach by the Cupertino-based company to making the most of the technological advances its financial firepower can deliver.  The iPhone maker\u2019s $390 million deal in December to secure supplies from VCSEL-maker Finisar was one such move. Another is Apple\u2019s discussions with major cobalt producers to nail down supplies for lithium-ion rechargeable batteries that power its mobile phones.  \u201cApple is always very focused on its supply chain,\u201d says Gartner\u2019s Erensen. \u201cWhen it comes to new technologies like this and implementing them to new phones, it\u2019s one of the ways that Apple can really can be aggressive, differentiate and take advantage of the position they have in the market.\u201d  Several sector analysts say their channel checks show Apple was initially sourcing VCSELs chiefly from California-based Lumentum and that bottlenecks in production there last year also spurred the $390 million deal with Finisar.  Lumentum, which declined to comment, is ramping up additional manufacturing capacity for VCSELs and edge-emitting lasers for the first half of fiscal 2019, according to the company\u2019s earnings call.  It will also be helped by the purchase this week of another optical components producer Oclaro Inc. Finisar too, expects to expand in 2019.  All of that, however, still leaves the major Android producers searching for their own supplies of VCSELs.  Craig Thompson, vice president of new markets at Finisar, says interest in the technology is universal across the sector.  \u201cEach customer has their own adoption timeline and rollout plan, which we can\u2019t discuss, but we expect the market opportunity for VCSEL technology to increase substantially in 2019,\u201d he says.  Another producer, Austria-based Ams, also expects to have VCSEL chips widely available next year and says it has won a large deal with one phone maker.  \u201cAs part of a combined external and internal VCSEL supply chain where an external volume production supply chain is available to us, we are currently building internal VCSEL production capacity in Singapore,\u201d Moritz Gmeiner, head of investor relations for AMS, told Reuters.  \u201cI expect this capacity to be available for mass production next year.\u201d","525":"March 4 (Reuters) -  * APPLE CONFIRMS IT IS DROPPING OUT OF SXSW CONFERENCE- BLOOMBERG NEWS REPORTER TWEET Source text: bit.ly\/2TncbK2 Further company coverage:","526":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O on Thursday became the first $1 trillion publicly listed U.S. company, crowning a decade-long rise fueled by its ubiquitous iPhone that transformed it from a niche player in personal computers into a global powerhouse spanning entertainment and communications.  The tech company\u2019s stock jumped 2.9 percent to end the day at $207.39, giving it a market capitalization of $1.002 trillion. During the session, Apple\u2019s stock market value reached as much as $1.006 trillion.  Apple has rallied about 9 percent since Tuesday, when it reported June-quarter results above expectations and said it bought back $20 billion of its own shares. It was Apple\u2019s best two-day run since April 2014.  In a memo to Apple\u2019s more than 120,000 employees on Thursday that was seen by Reuters, Chief Executive Tim Cook said the $1 trillion valuation was \u201ca significant milestone\u201d that gave Apple employees \u201cmuch to be proud of.\u201d But he said it was \u201cnot the most important measure\u201d of the company\u2019s success.  \u201cFinancial returns are simply the result of Apple\u2019s innovation, putting our products and customers first, and always staying true to our values,\u201d Cook said in the memo.  Started in the garage of co-founder Steve Jobs in 1976, Apple has pushed its revenue beyond the economic outputs of Portugal, New Zealand and other countries. Along the way, it has changed how consumers connect with one another and how businesses conduct daily commerce.  Apple's stock market value is greater than the combined capitalization of Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N, Procter & Gamble Co PG.N and AT&T Inc T.N. It now accounts for 4 percent of the S&P 500.  The Silicon Valley stalwart\u2019s stock has surged more than 50,000 percent since its 1980 initial public offering, dwarfing the S&P 500\u2019s approximately 2,000 percent increase during the same almost four decades.  One of three founders, Jobs was driven out of Apple in the mid-1980s, only to return a decade later and rescue the computer company from near bankruptcy.  He launched the iPhone in 2007, dropping \"Computer\" from Apple's name and super-charging the cellphone industry, catching Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Intel Corp INTC.O, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS and Nokia off guard. That put Apple on a path to overtake Exxon Mobil in 2011 as the largest U.S. company by market value.  During that time, Apple evolved from selling Mac personal computers to becoming an architect of the mobile revolution with a cult-like following.  Jobs, who died in 2011, was succeeded as chief executive by Tim Cook, who has doubled the company\u2019s profits but struggled to develop a new product to replicate the society-altering success of the iPhone, which has seen sales taper off in recent years.  In 2006, the year before the iPhone launch, Apple generated less than $20 billion in sales and net profit just shy of $2 billion. By last year, its sales had grown more than 11-fold to $229 billion - the fourth highest in the S&P 500 .SPX - and net income had mushroomed at twice that rate to $48.4 billion, making it the most profitable publicly listed U.S. company.  Slideshow ( 13 images )  \u2018STILL SEE UPSIDE\u2019  Jeff Carbone, co-founder of Cornerstone Financial Partners in Charlotte, North Carolina, has included Apple in his clients\u2019 portfolios for about a decade. Recently, some of his older clients have bought Apple shares for their grandchildren.  \u201cWe still see upside from it, and as new money gets deposited we continue to buy, preferably on the dip,\u201d Carbone said.  Slideshow ( 13 images )  Apple\u2019s stock has risen over 30 percent in the past year, fueled by optimism about the iPhone X, launched a decade after the original. Also propelling Apple higher in recent months was Apple\u2019s announcement that it earmarked $100 billion for a new share repurchase program.  In its report on Tuesday, Apple sales led by the iPhone X, which sells for about $1,000, pushed quarterly results far beyond Wall Street targets, with subscriptions from App Store, Apple Music and iCloud services bolstering business.  \u201cThe markets are starting to recognize the value of its platform and services more and more, and that\u2019s what is being reflected in the increase in market capitalization,\u201d said Brad Neuman, director of Market Strategy at Alger, a growth equity asset management firm in New York City.  Even with its $1,000,000,000,000 stock market value, many analysts do not view Apple\u2019s shares as expensive. Shares of Apple this week traded at about 15 times expected earnings, compared with Amazon at 82 times earnings and Microsoft at 25 times earnings.  Adjusting for four stock splits over the years, Apple debuted on the stock market for the equivalent of 39 cents a share on Dec. 12, 1980, compared with Thursday\u2019s high of $208.38.  In 2015, Apple joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average, one of capitalism's most exclusive clubs. Since 1980, IBM Corp IBM.N, Exxon Mobil XOM.N, General Electric Co GE.N and Microsoft have also alternated as the largest publicly listed U.S. company.  In 2007, Chinese government-controlled PetroChina 601857.SS briefly reached a stock market value of about $1.1 trillion following its public listing in Shanghai. It is now worth about $200 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.  One of five U.S. companies since the 1980s to take a turn as Wall Street's largest company by market capitalization, Apple could lose its lead to the likes of Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O or Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O if it does not find a major new product or service as global demand for smartphones loses steam.  Hot on Apple\u2019s heels is Amazon.com, the second-largest listed U.S. company by market value, at around $880 billion, closely followed by Google-owner Alphabet and by Microsoft.

At the meeting, shareholders defeated two shareholder proposals, one asking that rules allowing shareholders to nominate directors to the board be eased, and another asking for a human rights committee at Apple.  The proxy access measure asked Apple to reconsider its rules for shareholders to nominate directors; the rules say that a group of no more than 20 shareholders must hold 3 percent of Apple\u2019s stock in order to nominate a director for one of the eight director positions. The proposal did not pass, with 67.8 percent of shareholders voting against it.  Another proposal urged Apple to create a human rights panel to oversee issues such as workplace conditions and censorship in China and to report results back to the public. The proposal was defeated, with 94.4 percent of shareholders voting against it.  Apple had recommended that shareholders vote against both of the measures.

Speaking at an event at the iPhone maker\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, California, Vice President for Apple Pay Jennifer Bailey said the new Apple Card service will work through the company\u2019s wallet app Apple Pay.  Users of the card, which will be issued by Goldman Sachs Group Inc, will earn 2 percent cash back on all purchases made through the digital wallet or 3 percent cash back on Apple products.  There will also be a physical card, which will give users 1 percent cash back on purchases.  The credit service will come with new features in the Apple Wallet aimed at helping consumers track their spending with a breakdown of monthly purchasing trends.  Cash back rewards will be credited to Apple Pay users\u2019 accounts on a daily basis, Bailey said, and the card will not charge any international fees.  Credit card industry analysts said the rewards programs were not significantly different from what is currently available in the market, but that Apple\u2019s broad consumer reach could make it a major player.  \u201cFrankly I am bit underwhelmed,\u201d said Ted Rossman, an analyst at Creditcards.com.

REUTERS\/Yves Herman\/File Photo  The Chinese company, which overtook Apple AAPL.O this year to become the No. 2 smartphone maker by units - behind South Korea's Samsung 005930.KS - introduced its Mate 20 phone series using Leica camera technology.  Huawei\u2019s new premium phone line-up has four models available around the world, expect in the United States where sales are effectively banned over whispered national security concerns.  The new line-up includes the Mate 20, with list prices ranging from 799-849 euros ($925-$983), depending on memory configuration.  The fuller-featured Mate 20 Pro, is priced as low as 799 pounds at some UK retailers and list priced at 849 pounds or 1,049 euros across Europe. A comparable iPhone X Max from Apple costs 1,099 pounds in the UK.  The new phones include a new ultra-wide angle lens, as well as a 3x telephoto lens and a macro that shoots objects as close as 2.5 centimeters (1 inch).  Mate P20 models take advantage of artificial intelligence features built into Huawei\u2019s own Kirin chipsets.  Features available to Mate 20 users include being able to isolate human subjects and desaturate the colors around them in order to highlight people against their backgrounds.  Huawei incorporates bigger light-sensing chips than rival phones to take better pictures in low-light conditions.  Gartner analyst Roberta Cozza said that in a highly commoditized smartphone market of look-alike phones, Huawei is managing to differentiate itself with camera and personalization features.  \u201cWith the Mate 20, Huawei is setting the bar for what users can expect from photography using a smartphone,\u201d Cozza said.  The Chinese phone maker managed to surpass Apple to take the No. 2 spot in the second quarter, industry data shows, despite being effectively excluded from the U.S. market.  However, Apple commanded 43 percent of the premium market and a lion\u2019s share of profits, CounterPoint Research estimated.  \u201cHuawei is clearly ticking all the key boxes needed to displace rivals \u2013 and not just Android-powered rivals,\u201d said Ben Wood, research chief of mobile industry consulting firm CCS Insight.  Wood said Huawei\u2019s move to match Apple iPhone\u2019s characteristic swipe gestures and face unlock features on its Mate 20 Pro could, in theory, make it easier for committed Apple buyers to switch, although he said that was unlikely near term.  \u201cBut it\u2019s clear that Huawei has an eye on the future and is ready to take share from Apple if the time comes that a loyal iPhone owner decides to try something else,\u201d he said.

Make them in the USA, no Tariffs!\u201d Trump tweeted.  On July 18, Apple asked the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office to waive 25% tariffs on 15 parts, including ones for the Mac Pro desktop computer. The public comment period for those requests closes on Aug. 1.  Trump later told reporters he thought Apple would build a plant in Texas, without elaborating on exactly what he was referring to or how he knew.  \u201cI want Apple to build their plants in the United States.

Apple does not disclose sales figures for its Mac Pro, but analysts do not believe it is a high-volume seller for the company compared to the iPhone. Priced at $6,000 and up, it is aimed at professional users such as movie and music studios.  Trump has previously made claims about Apple\u2019s plans to build new U.S. plants, which have not materialized.  Apple did say in December it would build a second campus in Austin, Texas. The company is also spending $390 million with supplier Finisar Corp that helped the chipmaker re-open a 700,000-square-foot factory in Texas.  TRADE WAR  Trump has levied billions of dollars in tariffs on Chinese imports and threatened to impose levies on another $325 billion of Chinese goods if no progress is reached in a trade dispute that has disrupted global supply chains and shaken financial markets.  For Apple, China is both a key market and a major production center for its devices. The company got nearly 18% of its total revenue from Greater China in the quarter that ended in March.  Apple in June asked its major suppliers to assess the cost implications of moving 15% to 30% of its production capacity from China to Southeast Asia, according to a Nikkei report.

Concerns about slowing economic growth also pushed down the dollar.  The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index dropped 1.7 percent following a decline in shares of Apple and its suppliers. The Wall Street Journal reported Apple had cut production orders in recent weeks for iPhone models it launched in September.  Renewed tensions between China and the United States also weighed.

Mixed signals regarding the Federal Reserve\u2019s course of rate hikes in the face of a potential economic slowdown also weighed on markets, investors said.  Federal Reserve policymakers have recently raised concern about a potential global slowdown, leading some market watchers to suspect the tightening cycle may not have much further to run.

Still, New York Fed President John Williams stated that the U.S. central bank is moving ahead with its plans for gradual rate hikes as it marches toward a more normal policy stance.  \u201cThere\u2019s a widening gap between the Fed and what the markets think is the right course,\u201d McMillan said.

The bug, which also exists on iPads, was discovered by ZecOps, a San Francisco-based mobile security forensics company, while it was investigating a sophisticated cyberattack against a client that took place in late 2019. Zuk Avraham, ZecOps\u2019 chief executive, said he found evidence the vulnerability was exploited in at least six cybersecurity break-ins.  An Apple spokesman acknowledged that a vulnerability exists in Apple\u2019s software for email on iPhones and iPads, known as the Mail app, and that the company had developed a fix, which will be rolled out in a forthcoming update on millions of devices it has sold globally.  Apple declined to comment on Avraham\u2019s research, which was published on Wednesday, that suggests the flaw could be triggered from afar and that it had already been exploited by hackers against high-profile users.  Avraham said he found evidence that a malicious program was taking advantage of the vulnerability in Apple\u2019s iOS mobile operating system as far back as January 2018. He could not determine who the hackers were and Reuters was unable to independently verify his claim.  To execute the hack, Avraham said victims would be sent an apparently blank email message through the Mail app forcing a crash and reset. The crash opened the door for hackers to steal other data on the device, such as photos and contact details.  ZecOps claims the vulnerability allowed hackers to remotely steal data off iPhones even if they were running recent versions of iOS. By itself, the flaw could have given access to whatever the Mail app had access to, including confidential messages.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Avraham, a former Israeli Defense Force security researcher, said he suspected that the hacking technique was part of a chain of malicious programs, the rest undiscovered, which could have given an attacker full remote access. Apple declined to comment on that prospect.  ZecOps found the Mail app hacking technique was used against a client last year. Avraham described the targeted client as a \u201cFortune 500 North American technology company,\u201d but declined to name it. They also found evidence of related attacks against employees of five other companies in Japan, Germany, Saudi Arabia, and Israel.  Avraham based most of his conclusions on data from \u201ccrash reports,\u201d which are generated when programs fail in mid-task on a device. He was then able to recreate a technique that caused the controlled crashes.  Two independent security researchers who reviewed ZecOps\u2019 discovery found the evidence credible, but said they had not yet fully recreated its findings.  Patrick Wardle, an Apple security expert and former researcher for the U.S. National Security Agency, said the discovery \u201cconfirms what has always been somewhat of a rather badly kept secret: that well-resourced adversaries can remotely and silently infect fully patched iOS devices.\u201d  Because Apple was not aware of the software bug until recently, it could have been very valuable to governments and contractors offering hacking services. Exploit programs that work without warning against an up-to-date phone can be worth more than $1 million.  While Apple is largely viewed within the cybersecurity industry as having a high standard for digital security, any successful hacking technique against the iPhone could affect millions due to the device\u2019s global popularity. In 2019, Apple said there were about 900 million iPhones in active use.  Bill Marczak, a security researcher with Citizen Lab, a Canada-based academic security research group, called the vulnerability discovery \u201cscary.\u201d  \u201cA lot of times, you can take comfort from the fact that hacking is preventable,\u201d said Marczak. \u201cWith this bug, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve got a PhD in cybersecurity, this will eat your lunch.\u201d","542":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc soundly beat quarterly revenue estimates on Wednesday after heavy holiday advertising by e-commerce retailers, but it warned Apple\u2019s impending privacy changes could hurt revenue by interfering with ad targeting.  The world\u2019s biggest social media company said it expected to face \u201csignificant ad targeting headwinds in 2021.\u201d Facebook forecast that Apple\u2019s update of its iPhone operating system to iOS 14 could start biting into revenues as early as the end of the first quarter.  Shares were flat after hours following an initial drop.  The fourth-quarter results validated the company\u2019s focus on making it easier for retailers to sell products to Facebook users, who frequently were stuck at home last year during the COVID-19 pandemic.  For example, Facebook launched Facebook Pay and Facebook Shops which enable consumers to click on ads and make purchases without leaving the company\u2019s apps, which also include Instagram and WhatsApp.  The company said the pandemic-driven surge in online commerce and shift in consumer demand to products over services buoyed revenue growth, which has been cooling steadily as its business matures.  Total revenue, which consists almost entirely of advertising sales, rose 33% to $28.07 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 from $21.08 billion a year earlier.

Net income came in at $11.22 billion, or $3.88 per share, compared with $7.35 billion, or $2.56 per share, a year earlier.  Monthly active users rose 12% to 2.80 billion, above the 2.75 billion expected by analysts.  REDUCING POLITICAL CONTENT  While financially strong, Facebook has faced criticism about misinformation and calls for violence on its platforms tied to the U.S. presidential election, including the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6.  Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told investors in a call that he wanted to \u201cturn down the temperature\u201d of political conversations because \u201cpeople don\u2019t want politics and fighting to take over their experience on our services.\u201d  An election-related moratorium on political-group recommendations to U.S. users will become permanent and political content in the network\u2019s newsfeed will drop. These changes will not hurt Facebook\u2019s financial outlook, he said.  Zuckerberg also took aim at Apple Inc, which he said Facebook executives increasingly view as the company\u2019s biggest competitor, even though the iPhone maker earns only a small fraction of its income from digital advertising.  Apple\u2019s business \u201cdepends more and more on gaining share in apps and services,\u201d said Zuckerberg, giving it \u201cevery incentive to use (its) dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work.\u201d  Facebook has feuded with Apple for months over the iPhone maker\u2019s plan to limit app developers\u2019 collection of user data from other apps. Facebook uses the data to improve ad targeting.  The social network, which is facing U.S. antitrust lawsuits from both the Federal Trade Commission and dozens of states, accuses Apple of behaving anticompetitively.  Analysts said Facebook is less likely to suffer from Apple\u2019s privacy updates than other ad-supported companies that have less access to their own first-party data.  \u201cIn the end, I don\u2019t think Facebook will be impacted as much as others as Facebook can provide workarounds for ad targeting,\u201d said analyst Jonathan Kees of Summit Insights Group.","543":"A federal judge has declined Apple Inc\u2019s request to disqualify lawyers at Cotchett Pitre & McCarthy from representing consumers in a proposed class action alleging Apple slowed down aging iPhones as a sanction for improperly disclosing confidential documents in court.

The extent of the drop contrasted with resilient sales of Apple\u2019s popular iPhone in a climate of waning demand. Foxconn assembles the bulk of Apple products including iPhones.  Foxconn, formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, did not elaborate on its earnings. Analysts said a stronger local dollar and higher marketing costs may have contributed to the decline.  \u201cWe think higher opex (operating expense) could be a new norm for Hon Hai, due to its business diversification,\u201d Nomura analysts said in a report.  They said higher spending on marketing for new customers as well as research-and-development in networking, cloud computing, television and smartphones likely squeezed its operating profit margin to 2.4 percent, below Nomura\u2019s 3.0 percent forecast.  Chief Executive Terry Gou has been reducing dependence on Apple through diversification. In 2016, it bought control of Japanese electronics and display panel maker Sharp Corp 6753.T.  In March, a Foxconn unit said it would buy U.S. consumer electronics maker Belkin International Inc for $866 million. Another unit, which makes industrial robots and equipment for cloud computing, plans to list in Shanghai to raise capital for fifth-generation (5G) network-related projects.  Foxconn shares have underperformed this year - falling around 10 percent versus the broader market's .TWII 2.8 percent gain - partly due to investors questioning its reliance on Apple and the prospect of slowing smartphone sales growth.  The stock fell as much as 3.4 percent on Tuesday, reversing gains of as much as 6.4 percent on Monday. That rise was buoyed by a plan announced late on Friday to cut equity capital by 20 percent, or T$34.7 billion, to boost shareholder returns.  Foxconn also said it would sell up to T$27 billion in bonds to refinance debt and replenish working capital.  \u201cWe think Hon Hai\u2019s proposal of cash capital reduction would increase future EPS (earnings per share), but shareholders\u2019 cash returns would actually be unchanged, given the reduced cash dividend,\u201d Nomura analysts said.

The Apple logo is displayed at an event at their headquarters in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 10, 2019. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  The disagreement came after Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall criticized Apple\u2019s accounting methods for the tech giant\u2019s new TV+ product, saying in a research note that it may result in lower gross margins and profits.  In response, Apple said it does \u201cnot expect the introduction of Apple TV+, including the accounting treatment for the service, to have a material impact on our financial results.\u201d  A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment or to make the analyst available for interview. Apple also declined to comment on the Goldman relationship beyond its comment on the note.  While research departments at large Wall Street banks have Chinese walls separating them from other functions, the rare public dispute is an awkward moment between the two companies.  Goldman Sachs has underwritten more bond issuances for Apple in the last decade than any other investment bank, worth some $44 billion, according to financial data provider Refinitiv.  Goldman Sachs also advised Apple on mergers and acquisitions as recently as two months ago, guiding it through its $1 billion deal to acquire the majority of Intel\u2019s smartphone modem business, according to Refinitiv.  And just last month, the two worked together to launch both companies\u2019 first credit card -- the Apple Card.  Every bank formally separates its equity research and investment bank divisions because of laws passed in the early 2000s that aimed to protect the independence of the equity analysts from investment bankers, who are often covering the same companies with different agendas.  Corporate clients usually respect the independence of the research division. When they don\u2019t, it gets a lot of attention.  In May last year, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk refused to answer questions from analysts about the company\u2019s capital requirements, calling the questions \u201cboring\u201d and \u201cnot cool\u201d during a conference call to discuss Tesla\u2019s performance. He later criticized several analysts directly for negative calls.  At the beginning of its fiscal year, Apple changed where it accounts for the value and costs of free services - like Apple Maps - and moved it into its services segment. Previously this was accounted for under the individual products.  In his note, Goldman\u2019s Hall said Apple was likely to treat TV+ subscriptions in a similar way, by accounting for it as a discounted bundle of a free service paired with a hardware purchase. Hall said that would result in Apple investors seeing lower average selling prices for iPhones and other Apple devices but faster growth in the company\u2019s services segment.  Many Apple investors have come to focus on growth in the services segment as the global smart phone market has stagnated, with Apple shares rising this year despite year over year declines in iPhone sales for its most recent two quarters.","551":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window.)  * Apple dips ahead of expected video streaming service launch  * Boeing rises on plan to brief on 737 MAX updates  * Mueller finds no Trump-Russia conspiracy  * Indexes down: Dow 0.1 pct, S&P 0.2 pct, Nasdaq 0.2 pct (Updates to late afternoon)  NEW YORK, March 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slipped on Monday, extending the previous session\u2019s sell-off, hit by worries of a slowdown in global economic growth and as Apple shares fell.

Judge Gonzalo Curiel of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California on Thursday ruled that Qualcomm, the world\u2019s biggest supplier of mobile phone chips, was obligated to pay nearly $1 billion in rebate payments to Apple, which for years used Qualcomm\u2019s modem chips to connect iPhones to wireless data networks.  The payments were part of a business cooperation agreement between the two companies amid the peculiar patent licensing practices of the consumer electronics industry.  In general, the contract factories that built Apple\u2019s iPhones would pay Qualcomm billions of dollars per year for the use of Qualcomm\u2019s patented technology in iPhones, a cost that Apple would reimburse the contract factories for. Separately, Qualcomm and Apple had a cooperation agreement under which Qualcomm would pay Apple a rebate on the iPhone patent payments if Apple agreed not to attack in court or with regulators.  In a lawsuit filed two years ago, Apple sued Qualcomm, alleging that the chip supplier had broken the cooperation agreement by not paying nearly $1 billion in patent royalty rebates.  Qualcomm in turn alleged that it stopped paying the rebate payments because Apple had broken the agreement by urging other smartphone makers to complain to regulators and making \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d statements to the Korean Fair Trade Commission, which was investigating Qualcomm over antitrust allegations. Apple responded that it was making lawful responses to regulators in an ongoing investigation.  Judge Curiel sided with Apple, ruling that Qualcomm owed the missed rebate payments.  \u201cAlthough the Court today did not view Apple\u2019s conduct as a breach of Apple\u2019s promises to Qualcomm in the 2013 Business Cooperation and Patent Agreement, the exposure of Apple\u2019s role in these events is a welcome development,\u201d Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, told Reuters in a statement.  Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  However, the decision will not become final until after the trial in the case, which begins next month. And it is unlikely that Qualcomm will make a new payment to Apple.  Apple\u2019s contract factories, which under normal circumstances would pay Qualcomm for patent royalties owed on iPhones, have already withheld the nearly $1 billion in payments to Qualcomm. Qualcomm\u2019s Rosenberg said those withheld iPhone payments have already been accounted for in Qualcomm\u2019s existing financial statements.  \u201cApple has already offset the payment at issue under the agreement against royalties that were owed to Qualcomm,\u201d Qualcomm\u2019s Rosenberg told Reuters.

Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developer Conference comes as paid services sold through the App Store have become central to the Cupertino, California, company\u2019s revenue growth as consumers have slowed the growth of iPhone upgrades. Apple takes a 15% to 30% cut of the sales developers make through the App Store, which is the only way to distribute software onto Apple\u2019s mobile devices.  Those fees, and Apple\u2019s strict app review process, have come under antitrust scrutiny in the United States and Europe, where regulators last week unveiled a formal probe into the company.  But developers still gravitate toward Apple\u2019s platform because it is lucrative, with a user base that is willing to spend money on paid apps. The annual developer conference, being held online this year for the first time because of the novel coronavirus, is where Apple often announces access to new hardware capabilities, such as special tools for artificial intelligence and augmented reality.  Apple this year could announce a move to part ways with Intel, which has supplied processors for Mac computers since 2006. Apple could announce a move to use its own house-designed processors as soon as Monday, two people familiar with matter told Reuters. The company, which already uses its own processor designs in iPhones in iPads, could announce one laptop model and one desktop model that will use the new chips, one of the people told Reuters.  An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the company\u2019s future plans or products.  If Apple announces the move Monday, it will build on a tool it introduced last year called Catalyst, which aims to make it easier for developers to move their apps from Apple\u2019s mobile operating systems to Mac computers.

Apple said it was unlikely to meet the March quarter sales guidance set just three weeks ago. HSBC Holdings PLC also warned about the impact of the coronavirus on its Asia business. \"With Apple coming out and missing sales just on the coronavirus, it continued the risk-off tone on growth concerns,\" said Justin Lederer, an interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. German economic data also showed the virus weighing on sentiment. The mood among German investors deteriorated far more than expected in February on worries that the coronavirus outbreak would dampen world trade. China reported on Tuesday its fewest new coronavirus infections since January and its lowest daily death toll for a week, but the World Health Organization said data suggesting the epidemic had slowed should still be viewed with caution. Benchmark 10-year note yields fell three basis points to 1.55%. Thirty-year bond yields dropped four basis points to 2.00%. They earlier fell to 1.98%, the lowest since Sept. 5, and are approaching a record low of 1.905% set on Aug. 28. A global thirst for yield and expectations that inflation will remain tepid have increased demand for longer-dated U.S. debt and flattened the U.S. yield curve. The curve between three-month bills and 10-year notes was inverted on Tuesday at negative two basis points. It inverted in March for the first time in over a decade, indicating that a recession is likely in the next year or two.

Broadcom Inc, among the world\u2019s biggest chipmakers, weighed on the tech-heavy Nasdaq after it said in results late on Thursday that demand for microchips had bottomed out and that a recovery was not yet on the cards.  That pointed to more headwinds for tech companies buffetted this year by the trade conflict and added to a handful of negative signals for Apple, including a Goldman Sachs cut in its price target for the stock, citing concerns over its new Apple TV+ service.  After an otherwise upbeat start for Wall Street, the two companies together were the main driver in bringing the S&P 500 back to earth.  Having risen to within 0.4% of its record high in early trading, the benchmark index was up just 0.2% by 11 a.m. et., with financial stocks up 0.44%.  \u201cThe monitor would be painted with green if not for Apple, Broadcom and Amazon,\u201d said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.  Banks followed U.S. Treasury yields higher after data showed U.S. retail sales rose 0.4% in August, lifted by spending on cars, building materials, healthcare and hobbies. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an increase of 0.2%.  \u201c(The data) demonstrates that consumers are still opening their wallets as low unemployment and high consumer confidence coupled with better wages is driving increased consumer spending,\u201d said Moody\u2019s Vice President Mickey Chadha.  If early gains hold, markets are set for their third straight week of gains, having already recouped losses from August when escalating trade tensions and the inversion of a key part of the U.S. yield curve drove investors toward assets perceived to be safe-havens in the event of a downturn.  The doubts about growth remain but have been soothed this week by a combination of signals of central bank support for the economy and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s latest comments that he was potentially open to an interim trade deal with China.  On Friday, China\u2019s official Xinhua News Agency said the country would exempt some U.S. pork and soybeans from additional tariffs on U.S. goods.  Tyson Foods Inc, the United States\u2019 largest meat processor, rose 3.4%.  \u201cIf you are hoping for a trade deal, the comments that President Trump made are probably the best you could expect right now,\u201d said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.  However, Pavlik added that a trade deal - interim or otherwise - was not likely to be signed before the 2020 presidential election.  The trade conflict has taken a toll on U.S. manufacturing and tempered global growth, with the International Monetary Fund forecasting that the tit-for-tat tariffs between the United States and China could reduce global GDP in 2020 by 0.8%.  Investors are now expecting the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut rates at its policy meeting next week.

After Jeff Bezos founded the online book-selling company in his garage in 1994, Amazon survived the dot-com crisis and then expanded across the retail industry, altering how consumers buy products and setting off a Darwinian struggle among brick-and-mortar stores.  After announcing on Wednesday that it sold more than $100 million products during its annual Prime Day sale, the Seattle, Washington company\u2019s stock briefly touched $1,858.88, giving Amazon a stock market value of $902 billion. It later reversed, trading down 0.16 percent for the session.  Amazon\u2019s stock has surged more than 57 percent in 2018, bringing its increase to over 123,000 percent since it listed on the Nasdaq in 1997. An investor who bought 1 share of Amazon for $18 in the IPO would now have an investment worth more than $22,200, including three stock splits in the 1990s.  Amazon, video streaming service Netflix NFLX.O and a handful of heavyweight technology companies have fueled Wall Street's rally in recent years and they remain key parts of portfolio managers' portfolios.  Apple replaced Exxon Mobil XOM.N in late 2011 as the U.S. company with the largest stock market value.

Amazon has increased its share count by over 1 million shares per quarter in recent years, and if it continued that in the June quarter, its stock market value may already have exceeded $900 billion.  Amazon reports its results on July 26 and Apple, which has been reducing its share count through buybacks, reports its June-quarter results on July 31.  As Amazon expands into grocery retail through its acquisition of Whole Foods Market last year, and as more businesses move their IT departments onto the cloud, its stock price has been red hot, recently trading at 111 times expected earnings, compared to more-profitable - but slower growing - Apple\u2019s valuation of 15 times earnings.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  Several developers have challenged Google and Apple over their app policies, triggering calls for regulatory action as nearly all smartphones outside restricted markets such as China come with either Google\u2019s Play store or Apple\u2019s App Store.  In the United States, state attorneys general are planning a lawsuit against Google over its Play Store for Android phones following complaints, sources have told Reuters.  The latest complaint filed with the European Commission came this week from the German app developer Florian Mueller, who is also a lobbyist and blogger and once led a successful campaign against a piece of EU legislation.  Mueller has filed a similar complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice and antitrust watchdogs in Germany, the Netherlands, Britain and Australia. He is also planning to file another in India next week.  Mueller says the app rules set by the two U.S. tech giants are holding back innovation, in breach of EU regulation, after both companies rejected his Corona Control Game app in November.  Google and Apple rules say COVID-19 related apps must be government approved in order to avoid promoting conflicting or incorrect health advice.  Google told Reuters in response to Mueller\u2019s complaint that it only approves apps that reference COVID-19 or related terms if they are published, commissioned, or authorized by an official government entity or public health organization.  Apple had no immediate comment but referred to guidelines issued in March which say entertainment or game apps with COVID-19 as their theme will not be allowed.  The Commission declined to comment. Whether the EU\u2019s antitrust enforcers decide to take up a case depends on the merits of the individual complaint and available resources.  Mueller\u2019s complaint, which was seen by Reuters, says: \u201cThe stated goal of \u2018ensuring the credibility of health and safety information\u2019 does not justify blanket rules based on authorship or merely the combination of a broad category and a topic\u201d.  Mueller said that after modifying his app and renaming it Viral Days so that it was not specifically concerning coronavirus, he last month got approval from Google and Apple.  The complaint said the rules in place by Google and Apple were denying small app developers market opportunities and hampering them by unreasonably slowing down and complicating the delivery of pre-release app versions to testers.","569":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window) (Updates to market close)  NEW YORK, June 19 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended lower on Friday after an up-and-down session as investors weighed spiking cases of COVID-19 and Apple Inc\u2019s announcement of fresh store closures against anticipated stimulus and continued economic recovery.  The S&P 500 ultimately settled in the red, along with the blue-chip Dow, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed modestly higher.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got these dueling forces with Fed stimulus and the consumer spending again on one side, and on the other side the resurgence (of COVID-19) in pockets of areas around the globe,\u201d said Matthew Keator, managing partner in the Keator Group, a wealth management firm in Lenox, Massachusetts.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq stood about 1% below its last closing high reached on June 10, after breaching that level earlier in the session.  Trading volume is typically light on summer Fridays as investors head into the weekend.  But Friday marked \u201cquadruple witching,\u201d in which futures and options expiries occur, and that typically translates into elevated volume and liquidity.

While Verizon is leading the charge to trial 5G in some cities next year, industry analysts say the higher-speed networks are unlikely to be widely available until the middle of the next decade.  Apple is engaged in a legal battle with Qualcomm that has led it to stop using its modem chips, and the Cupertino, California company is widely expected instead to use Intel modems, which will not be ready for production until late 2019.  Citing sources familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported on Monday that Apple would wait until at least 2020 to release its first 5G iPhones.  The delay could make it easier for Samsung and Verizon to win customers who are eager to connect to 5G networks, which will provide a leap forward in mobile data speeds, up to 50 or 100 times faster than current 4G networks.  Qualcomm has also partnered with other smartphone makers who have committed to 5G phones for next year.  U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp is also working with LG Electronics USA to launch a 5G smartphone in the U.S. in the first half of 2019.

The landmark deal buys time for the Anglo-German chip designer, which relies on Apple for three-quarters of sales, to reinvent itself as a more diversified firm that will target new markets such as the Internet of Things.  \u201cOur custom, configurable and programmable design expertise, coupled with our ability to quickly and reliably ramp to high-volume production, enables us to serve an increasingly broad customer base,\u201d Chief Executive Jalal Bagherli said in a statement.  Dialog\u2019s shares jumped by a third on Oct. 11, the day of the Apple deal, and gained another 9 percent on Wednesday after it released forecast-beating results and gave an upbeat outlook for the final quarter of 2018.  Bagherli was due to hold a strategy briefing with analysts in London on Thursday and ahead of the event the company provided its first guidance on its outlook for 2019. The Apple deal will not have any impact on the current year.  The company said overall revenues for 2019 would be roughly in line with this year\u2019s forecast of $1.46 billion. On a like-for-like basis, after stripping out the operations that will go to Apple, the top line will grow in the mid-teens.  With the Apple deal proceeds adding to the $617 million already on hand, Dialog said it had the financial flexibility to pursue growth, including through mergers and acquisitions, while continuing its policy of returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks.  Dialog said on Wednesday it would spend up to 150 million euros on buying back nearly a tenth of its shares.  STABLE MARGINS  Dialog\u2019s guidance for 2019 telegraphed a message of continuity. The company expects underlying gross margins of between 47 and 48 percent, a fraction below its third-quarter performance of 48.6 percent.  It sees underlying operating margin of between 18 and 23 percent, compared to a third-quarter outturn of 21.8 percent.  Dialog, which has no chip production assets of its own, is more tied to the fortunes of Apple than it is to the broader semiconductor industry cycle, where Korean electronics giant Samsung Electronics has warned that a two-year boom in memory chips could be ending.  It wants to shake off that image by deploying its expertise in so-called mixed-signal integrated circuits - which can handle both analogue and digital signals - to capture new market opportunities.  Dialog claims market leadership in rapid-charging and configurable mixed-signal circuits that are used, for example, to power up smartphones. It is number two in Bluetooth low-energy products that connect wearable devices like fitness trackers.  It said that in future it would focus on the Internet of Things - the online link-up of everyday objects via embedded communications technology - mobile, automotive, and computing and storage markets.

MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.2%, ending four days of losses. Australian shares rose 0.41%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei stock index rose 0.27%.  While China\u2019s flu-like illness, which has killed more than 100, continues to keep markets on edge, there were signs investors see the recent rout in asset prices as overdone.  Long-term U.S. Treasury yields traded above short-term yields and the Japanese yen nursed losses as investors pulled back from safe-havens in favour of more risky assets like equities.  Oil futures extended gains in Asia as pessimism about the virus eased somewhat and after OPEC sources said the cartel wants to extend crude output cuts by three months to June, easing concern about excess supplies.  Other investors say the growing number of travel restrictions within China and the cancellation of international flights could prevent a significant worsening of the virus.  \u201cThe rise in Treasury yields shows the risk-off trade is falling out of favour,\u201d said Kiyoshi Ishigane, chief fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Kokusai Asset Management Co in Tokyo.  \u201cThis is supportive of Japanese stocks.

The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 1.6493% versus a yield of 1.5821% on three-month Treasury bills in another sign that sentiment has stabilised.  The yield curve briefly inverted on Tuesday when 10-year yields fell below their 3-month counterparts for the first time since October. An inverted yield curve has historically been an indicator of looming recession.  Markets in Asia could be subdued before the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting later on Wednesday. The Fed is expected to reiterate its desire to keep rates unchanged at least through this year.  In currency markets, the safe-haven yen was quoted at 109.13 per dollar following a 0.2% loss on Tuesday. The Swiss franc, another popular safe haven, traded at 0.9730 versus the dollar, close to its lowest in almost three weeks.  In the offshore market, the yuan rose for a second day to 6.9605 per dollar. China\u2019s onshore markets are closed for the Lunar New Year holidays.  U.S. crude ticked up 0.47% to $53.73 a barrel in Asian trading.  OPEC wants to extend current oil output cuts until at least June from March, with the possibility of deeper reductions on the table if oil demand in China is significantly impacted by the spread of a new coronavirus, OPEC sources said.

FILE PHOTO: A motorcyclist rides past the logo of Foxconn, the trading name of Hon Hai Precision Industry, in Taipei, Taiwan March 30, 2018. REUTERS\/Tyrone Siu\/File Photo  The company, which kicked off a three-day event on Wednesday to celebrate its 30 years doing business in China, already does much more than assemble goods for others.  It\u2019s a top global producer of display screens, thanks to the acquisition of Sharp Corp. Its far-flung activities include autonomous car startups and investments in cancer research.  But with its stock down almost 20 percent since late last year, Foxconn, Taiwan\u2019s second most valuable company with a market cap of $51 billion, is under pressure to show that it can convert new initiatives into growth.  The Sharp purchase and a handful of more recent deals -including an agreement announced this week for Sharp to buy Toshiba Corp\u2019s personal computer business for $36 million - indicates that a push into producing its own branded products is one part of the strategy.  Just as important, though, is a plan to provide integrated solutions for businesses that include both sophisticated hardware and software services such as cloud computing, Foxconn chairman Terry Gou announced at the company\u2019s 30 year anniversary celebrations in Shenzhen on Wednesday.  This \u201cnew business model\u201d that could be especially appealing to smaller companies and institutions like hospitals, who have sophisticated technical requirements that they often have trouble handling on their own, Louis Woo, special assistant to Foxconn chairman Terry Gou, told Reuters in an interview.  \u201cWe have built data centers for many of our customers, but we\u2019re not known to provide data center services,\u201d Woo said. \u201cIn the future since we\u2019re having all these pieces, we can put them together to provide a technical service to a business customer.\u201d  The company is also betting that it can package its traditional expertise to sell \u201csmart manufacturing\u201d services, included fully automated factories, to other industrial companies.  Woo acknowledged that none of this would happen overnight - a view shared by skeptical analysts.  \u201cRight now, with the contract manufacturing, it\u2019s very hard to switch to a new model,\u201d said Vincent Chen, an analyst at Yuanta Investment Consulting in Taipei.  And it has to be careful to keep current customers onside, in particular Apple - which is estimated to still generate around half of Foxconn\u2019s total revenue.  \u201cThere will definitely be risks,\u201d in pursuing so many different areas, said Boyce Fan, an analyst at Trendforce. \u201cBut this will be key for Foxconn to find the next growth opportunity.\u201d  FOCUS ON TECH AND HEALTH-TECH  This attempt to pivot toward a new business model comes as trade disputes between the United States and China ratchet up.  \u201cI don\u2019t think the current conflict between the United States and China is about trade, it\u2019s about technology,\u201d Foxconn\u2019s chairman Terry Gou said in a video that was broadcast at the ceremony on Wednesday in Shenzhen.  \u201cRegardless whether we are talking about aeroplanes, ships or semiconductors, the United States is ahead of China so China needs to focus on designing and manufacturing technology,\u201d he said, noting that this was Foxconn\u2019s focus.  He added that, among other things, Foxconn recently bought 20,000 textbooks about AI for all of its employees to study, including line workers and office secretaries.  Gou also touted healthcare as a major new opportunity at Wednesday\u2019s opening ceremony.  The company\u2019s technical strengths are in Sharp\u2019s high-resolution imaging and displays, which use the next-generation 8K standard and have ready applications for medical imaging devices such as endoscopes.  Gou has also touted the possibility of smart toilets that can double as health diagnostic devices, Woo said, with sensors feeding data to the cloud for analysis. That would play to Foxconn\u2019s strength in 5G wireless communications equipment.  Such efforts won\u2019t come cheap, and Foxconn is laying the financial and political groundwork for its next chapter with a Shanghai IPO for one of its main subsidiaries, Foxconn Industrial Internet.  The $4.3 billion IPO will provide funding for initiatives in smart manufacturing, cloud computing, data centers and 5G technology, among other areas. A number of Chinese state-owned companies are expected to participate in the deal.  FII currently generates a big chunk of revenue from making comparatively mundane components such as smartphone casings and frames. And for all the talk of healthcare and cloud and AI, most of the IPO proceeds are earmarked for smart manufacturing.  Sharp is also selling $1.8 billion worth of new shares to buy back preferred stock, issued to banks in return for a financial bailout.  Meanwhile, the parent company has huge capital needs for the core display business, with new plants in China and the U.S. expected to cost almost $20 billion between them.  THE XIAOMI MODEL?  It is still unclear how hard Foxconn will push its own products in the mainstream consumer electronics business, a hyper-competitive arena where sophisticated marketing is crucial.  Fan at Trendforce says Foxconn could do more deals to acquire established brands. \u201cIt will use whatever branding there is already,\u201d he said, rather than try to build a Foxconn brand. The company earlier this year added to its brand portfolio with the acquisition of Belkin, a well-known U.S. maker of computer accessories.  Chen, the Yuanta analyst, said Chinese smartphone juggernaut Xiaomi could be a model for Foxconn to emulate.  He said Xiaomi is not only selling its phones and other products but also has a range of services to go with them, offered through their own stores.  But Woo expressed caution: \u201cWe\u2019re still looking at how to go about doing that without any direct conflict with our current customers,\u201d he said.  The world\u2019s largest contract manufacturer is planning long term, Gou said on Wednesday.  \u201cOur future plan isn\u2019t a ten year plan, it\u2019s a thirty year plan.\u201d","583":"FILE PHOTO: Japan Display Inc's high resolution panel for mobile is displayed at its headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, August 9, 2016.

The liquid crystal display (LCD) maker, money-losing for the past three years, has been making half its revenue selling LCDs to Apple Inc. But Japan Display was slow to adopt organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology, which Apple opted to use for its high-end iPhone X, buying components from Samsung Electronics.  Japan Display posted a net loss of 32.6 billion yen ($304 million) for the October-December quarter, versus a net profit of 7.3 billion yen in the same quarter a year ago.  That compared with an average 30.32 billion yen loss forecast by four analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Japan Display has been considering tapping new investors for capital to catch up in OLED, which it plans to start mass-producing for smartphones only in 2019.  Japan Display in December dismissed as speculative reports that it was seeking funds from clients such as Apple and Huawei Technologies, but said it was seeking to partner with global companies.  It has not disclosed who any potential partners might be. It said on Wednesday that partnership talks, previously expected to conclude by end-March, were taking more time than expected.  \u201cNegotiations are ongoing, so in the process of discussing details the talks have been pushed back,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Takanobu Oshima told reporters.  Aiming to counter declining sales with cost cuts, Japan Display plans to streamline production lines and reduce 30 percent of its workforce, resulting in a special loss of nearly 170 billion yen for the current year.","584":"FILE PHOTO: A screen displaying an advertisement for iPhone 11 Pro is seen outside an Apple store in Beijing, China October 31, 2019.

Apple has used India as a base to widen assembly beyond China as it adapts to a trade war between Beijing and Washington.  In India, it uses Foxconn\u2019s unit in southern Tamil Nadu state as well as Wistron\u2019s factory to make smartphones for the domestic market and for export.  Industry executives and tech analysts said Apple may seek to deepen ties with other contract manufacturers in India.  Pegatron Corp, another of Apple\u2019s Taiwan-based global suppliers, is expected to begin India operations soon.  Apart from any inconvenience to the companies, the fall-out from Saturday\u2019s violence in the southern Indian hub for automobile and electronics production, is a blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Make In India campaign to lure international manufacturers.  Officials are already working to limit the damage.  The technology ministry said in a statement the Wistron plant was an aberration.  Officials from New Delhi and the government of Karnataka state, where the plant is located, said they have assured Wistron of their support.  Analysts predict India can prevail.  \u201cThe episode could dent India\u2019s potential as a source base for larger corporations, but the overall attractiveness of this market will stand the test,\u201d said Abheek Barua, the chief economist at top Indian private lender HDFC Bank.  \u201cI also believe it will induce companies like Apple to take a closer look at their vendors and their policies, instead of driving them to an exodus.\u201d  ($1 = 73.5560 Indian rupees)","589":"Spotify illustration picture taken in Strasbourg, February 18, 2014. REUTERS\/Christian Hartmann  LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Spotify is pitching its complaint against Apple to a willing European audience. The Swedish music-streaming service has told antitrust regulators that its rival stifles competition. A case may take years. But the Stockholm-based group has adeptly timed its move to coincide with a broader backlash in Europe against U.S. Big Tech.  Daniel Ek\u2019s $26 billion group on Wednesday said it had filed a case with the European Commission, alleging that Apple uses its dominance of smartphone operating systems to hurt rival music-streaming services. The nub of the issue is the $857 billion group\u2019s restrictions on payment options for companies selling their wares through its app store.  Ek says that Apple charges his company a 30 percent fee for customers using the Apple payments system when they subscribe through the iPhone app. Spotify can avoid the charge by signing customers up in other ways, say through a web browser. But Apple\u2019s system limits his company\u2019s ability to direct customers away from the app, Ek says. To meet the cost of Apple\u2019s \u201ctax\u201d, Ek would have to hike prices above the level of its main rival, Apple Music.  Ek\u2019s move is a little cheeky, since both Spotify and Apple are listed in the United States. But it makes sense. Europe\u2019s outgoing competition chief Margrethe Vestager said on Thursday she takes the complaint \u201cvery seriously\u201d, and tweeted a picture of Ek endorsing his message. Last year she fined Google owner Alphabet 4.3 billion euros for using its dominant mobile operating system to promote other products like its web browser, which is conceptually similar to Ek\u2019s allegations against Apple. The commission has also drawn up rules supposed to govern the behaviour of \u201cplatforms\u201d like Apple\u2019s App Store and to stop them from discriminating against rivals. Those rules were backed by the European Parliament and Council last month.  Vestager\u2019s replacement as competition commissioner could be just as tough. Competition regulators in France and Germany have separately launched investigations into the dominance of Google and Facebook. The bloc\u2019s two most powerful economies recently published a joint industrial strategy to promote home-grown champions over foreign giants from Silicon Valley and China. Ek has chosen the right moment to strike.","590":"Nov 1 (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Thursday said sales for the crucial holiday quarter could miss Wall Street expectations, which Chief Executive Tim Cook blamed on weakness in emerging markets, foreign exchange costs and uncertainty whether the iPhone maker can keep up with demand for new products.  Apple said it expects between $89 billion and $93 billion in revenue for its fiscal first quarter ending in December, while Wall Street on average expects $93 billion, according Refinitiv data.  For the quarter ended in September, Apple brought in $62.9 billion in revenue and $2.91 per share in profits, beating expectations of $61.5 billion and $2.79, respectively.  In an interview with Reuters, Cook said some of the forecast was explained by Apple releasing its top-end iPhone models, the XS and XS Max, in the fiscal fourth quarter. Cook also said foreign exchange rates would have a $2 billion negative impact on Apple\u2019s sales forecast.  Apple was unsure whether it can make enough new iPhones, Apple Watches, iPads and Mac models it released in recent weeks, Cook told Reuters.  Cook said that Apple is \u201cseeing some macroeconomic weakness in some of the emerging markets,\u201d without specifying which ones.  But Cook stressed that Apple was happy with its performance in China, where revenue grew 16 percent to $11.4 billion, the fifth quarter in a row the company has had double-digit growth in the region.  Apple\u2019s cautious forecast could accelerate investor fears that have in turn erased stock market gains for much of the year. At market close on Thursday, Apple shares were up more than 25 percent for the year - supported by purchases by Warren Buffett and a $100 billion share buy-back program - while the Nasdaq Composite Index is nearly flat for the year.  Apple sold 46.9 million iPhones in the fiscal fourth quarter, missing analyst expectations of 47.5 million iPhones, according to FactSet. But the average selling price of iPhones was $793, well above analyst estimates of $750.78, according to FactSet.  Apple said revenue from services, which includes iCloud, the App Store and Apple Music, reached $10 billion, in line with analyst estimates. Apple investors have been increasingly focused on growth in the company\u2019s services business as growth in the global market for smartphones levels off in terms of unit sales.  Apple forecast a tax rate of 16.5 percent for the December quarter, above analyst expectations of 15.9 percent, according to data from Refinitiv.  \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a minimum tax on foreign earnings coming from the new tax legislation\u201d passed in the United States, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters.  For its full fiscal 2018 ended in September, Apple reported revenue of $265.6 billion and profits of $11.91 per share, beating analyst estimates of $264 billion and $11.79 per share.

Slideshow ( 10 images )  AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Apple Inc APPL.O is trying to change the way electronics are recycled with a robot that disassembles its iPhone so that minerals can be recovered and reused, while acknowledging rising global demand for electronics means new mines will still be needed. The Cupertino, California-based company says the robot is part of its plan to become a \"closed-loop\" manufacturer that does not rely on the mining industry, an aggressive goal that some industry analysts have said is impossible.  Many mining executives note that with the rising popularity of electric vehicles, newly mined minerals will be needed on an even larger scale, a reality that Apple acknowledges.  \u201cWe\u2019re not necessarily competing with the folks who mine,\u201d said Lisa Jackson, the company\u2019s head of environment, policy and social. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing for miners to fear in this development.\u201d  Inside a nondescript warehouse on the outskirts of Austin, Texas, Apple\u2019s Daisy robot breaks apart iPhones so that 14 minerals, including lithium, can be extracted and recycled.  Apple is already using recycled tin, cobalt and rare earths in some of its products, with plans to add to that list. The company last month bought the first commercial batch of carbon-free aluminum from a joint venture between Rio Tinto RIO.AX and Alcoa AA.N.  Daisy, less than 20 yards in length, uses a four-step process to remove an iPhone battery with a blast of -80 degree Celsius (-112\u00b0F) air, and then pop out screws and modules, including the haptic module that makes a phone vibrate.  The components are then sent off to recyclers for the minerals to be extracted and refined. Daisy can tear apart 200 iPhones per hour. Apple chose the iPhone to be the first of its products that Daisy would disassemble because of its mass popularity, said Jackson.  Apple is considering sharing the Daisy technology with others, including electric automakers. Daisy does have its skeptics, including some in the tech world who want the company to focus more on building products that can be repaired, not just recycled.  \u201cThere\u2019s this ego that believes they can get all their minerals back, and it\u2019s not possible,\u201d said Kyle Wiens, chief executive of iFixit, a firm advocating for electronics repair, rather than replacement.  That may partially explain why the mining industry isn\u2019t worried.  \u201cApple is in an enviable position, because they can do this,\u201d said Tom Butler, president of the International Council on Mining and Metals, an industry trade group. \u201cNot everyone else will be able to follow suit.\u201d","595":"CUPERTINO, Calif. (Reuters) - Apple Inc attempted to reintroduce itself on Monday as an entertainment and financial services company that also makes iPhones as it launched a streaming television service, a credit card and an online gaming arcade.  With appearances by Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg, the world\u2019s second-most valuable technology company lifted the curtain on a television and movie subscription service called Apple TV+ that will stream original television shows and movies.  The star-studded lineup failed to excite investors, who sent Apple shares down 1.2 percent.  The company\u2019s long-expected plunge into the streaming video war is years behind leaders Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc. Apple left out key details such as pricing, making it difficult to judge how its service will stack up against competitors.  \u201cWhile Apple may introduce a bigger roster of original content than Amazon and Netflix during their respective launches, the streaming market has arguably already reached a level of saturation and consumer fatigue in the United States,\u201d said Colin Gillis, an analyst at Chatham Road Partners.  The programming will come through a revamped television-watching app for users of Apple\u2019s 1.4 billion gadgets worldwide, as well as owners of smart TVs and other devices.  Apple is taking a different approach by offering paid \u201cchannels\u201d from AT&T Inc\u2019s HBO, Lions Gate Entertainment\u2019s Starz and CBS Corp\u2019s Showtime, alongside its own content.  Its revamped app for subscribing to channels from others will come out in May, but Apple\u2019s own original shows will not arrive until autumn, with pricing not yet announced. Apple said both its TV+ shows and the new version of the TV app will be available in more than 100 countries.  Apple also introduced a credit card, a digital video game arcade, and added hundreds of magazines to its news app at an event at its Cupertino, California, headquarters.  The launches come as Apple struggles with falling iPhone sales, which has prompted the company to turn more of its attention to services that provide regular subscription revenue.  Hollywood celebrities helped debut the revamped television offering. Apple has commissioned programming from Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Winfrey, Spielberg and others.  Winfrey, who announced a global book club and two documentaries, said she was drawn to Apple in part by its reach. \u201cThey\u2019re in a billion pockets, y\u2019all,\u201d she said, referring to Apple\u2019s ubiquitous devices.  Alongside its own iPhones, iPads and iMacs, Apple will make the programming widely available through smart TVs and devices from Roku Inc and others, departing from the past where it has tended to keep content exclusively on its own hardware.  Slideshow ( 18 images )  PRIVACY TO THE FORE  Throughout the presentation, Apple executives stressed privacy protections for consumers as they shop and consume content.  \u201cThe most important point for today was advertising and privacy,\u201d said D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Thomas Forte.  Slideshow ( 18 images )  Apple, second only to Microsoft Corp in market value among tech giants, led off the event with an announcement that its free news app will now come in a paid-subscription version, called Apple News+, which curates a range of news articles and will include 300 magazines including National Geographic, People, Popular Science, Billboard and the New Yorker. Apple said it would cost $9.99 a month.  Apple then introduced a titanium, laser-etched Apple Card backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Mastercard Inc that can track spending across devices and pay daily cash back on purchases. Cook said Apple Pay will be available in more than 40 countries by the end of the year.  The company also introduced Apple Arcade, a game subscription service that will work on phones, tablets and desktop computers and include games from a range of developers.  Apple said the gaming service will feature more than 100 exclusive titles from gaming partners such as Annapurna Interactive and that the service will arrive this autumn.  As with its original content service, Apple did not say how much its gaming service will cost consumers.  CROWDED FIELD  With its new media push, Apple joins a crowded field where Amazon.com\u2019s Prime Video and Netflix have spent heavily to capture viewer attention and dollars with award-winning series and films.  Apple\u2019s primarily family-friendly content, likely to appeal to young audiences, also sets the stage for a rivalry with Walt Disney Co.  The big tech war for viewers ignited a consolidation wave among traditional media companies preparing to join the fray. Disney, which bought 21st Century Fox, and AT&T, which purchased Time Warner, plan to launch or test new streaming video services this year.  Revenue from Apple\u2019s services - which include the App Store, iCloud and content businesses such as Apple Music - grew 24 percent to $37.1 billion in fiscal 2018. The segment accounted for only about 14 percent of Apple\u2019s overall $265.6 billion in revenue, but investors have pinned their hopes for growth on it.","596":"SHANGHAI, March 9 (Reuters) - Apple sold fewer than half a million smartphones in China in February, government data showed on Monday, as the coronavirus outbreak crippled demand.  China placed curbs on travel and asked residents to avoid public places in late January, just ahead of the Lunar New Year festival, a major gift-giving holiday. Those restrictions stayed largely in place through most of February.  In total, mobile phone brands shipped a total of 6.34 million devices that month, down 54.7% from 14 million in February 2019, data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology showed.  Android brands, which include devices made by Huawei Technologies and Xiaomi, accounted for most of the drop, as they collectively saw shipments decline from 12.72 million units in February 2019 to 5.85 million, the data showed.  Shipments of Apple devices slumped to 494,000, from 1.27 million in February 2019. In January, their shipments had held steady at just over 2 million.  Research firms IDC and Canalys have previously forecasted that overall smartphone shipments would drop roughly 40% in the first quarter as the virus outbreak hurt demand and sparked supply chain issue.  Apple\u2019s branded stores in China were shut for at least two weeks in February as fears over the coronavirus outbreak mounted.  The company\u2019s CEO Tim Cook wrote a letter to investors that month warning it would not meet its initial revenue guidance for the current quarter due to demand issues.

Apple, which sources LCD panels for iPhones from Japan Display, has agreed to shorten payment periods and to put up $200 million. The U.S. tech giant has rarely intervened to help distressed suppliers.  It will soon use organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens from Japan Display for the Apple Watch, diversifying supplies currently dependent on LG Display.

Apple\u2019s stock rose to as much as $179.14, just short of its $179.26 record close on Jan. 18 and shaking off a sell-off of more than 10 percent earlier this month following a lackluster quarterly report.  In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Buffett said his company, Berkshire Hathaway, had bought more Apple shares than any other stock over the past year. He also praised Apple's ability to retain customers in its iPhone ecosystem. (tinyurl.com\/ycrfcfx6)  Berkshire Hathaway disclosed on Feb. 14 that it had increased its stake in Apple by 23 percent, making it the company\u2019s largest common stock investment.  Also on Monday, Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, reported Apple was planning this year to launch its largest-ever iPhone, along with two other smartphones. (bloom.bg\/2HNO4wg)  Apple last year launched a 10th anniversary iPhone with premium features and a $1,000 price tag. But overall iPhone sales missed analysts\u2019 expectations in the December quarter, and the global smartphone market is struggling to grow.  New York-based investment management firm Inverness Counsel\u2019s money managers considered reducing clients\u2019 exposure to Apple following its quarterly report on Feb. 1, but ultimately decided not to make changes, said Chief Investment Strategist Tim Ghriskey.  \u201cYou still have a relatively inexpensive stock and an ecosystem that would be extremely hard to replicate,\u201d Ghriskey said. \u201cWe concluded that Apple would come out with something and calm the market, and make investors look to the future.\u201d  Since its quarterly report, nine analysts have raised their price targets for Apple, while six have reduced their targets. The median price target for Apple\u2019s stock has risen from $189.48 to $192.43, which is 7.5 percent higher than Monday\u2019s price.

Real estate stocks, utilities and consumer staples - commonly considered defensives - led declines following a rebound sparked by bargain hunters looking for stocks likely to weather an economic slump.  Another set of gains for Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc , Apple, Netflix Inc and Google-parent Alphabet Inc, known as the FAANG group of stocks, helped the Nasdaq jump 1% on Tuesday.  \u201cStocks have been on a wild ride ... (and) not surprisingly, investors are split on whether to lean in to or fade the current rally,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse Securities in New York.  An unprecedented round of fiscal and monetary stimulus had helped equity markets stabilize last week following wild swings that sent the benchmark S&P 500 up 9% one day only to slump 12% in the next session.  Wall Street\u2019s volatility index has retreated from 12-year highs, but is still at levels rarely seen since the global financial crisis as the outbreak deepens in the United States and disrupts supply chains.  Sliding from the record highs of mid February, the Dow Jones and S&P 500 indexes are now set to end the quarter more than 18% lower from the start of the year.  The declines have erased more than $5 trillion from the value of S&P 500 firms in the first quarter, and investors fear corporate defaults and more mass layoffs going in to the second quarter.  The blue-chip Dow is on course for its biggest quarterly percentage decline since 1987 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq is set to close out its worst first three months of the year since 2008.  \u201cWhile the majority of people want to remain optimistic that we\u2019ve seen the lows ... that optimism is merely based on a lot of hope,\u201d said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.  At 10:17 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 39.30 points, or 0.18%, at 22,366.78, the S&P 500 was up 0.54 points, or 0.02%, at 2,627.19. The Nasdaq Composite was up 51.60 points, or 0.66%, at 7,825.75.  Shares of Carnival Corp, already by hammered by plunging global travel demand, tumbled 12% after it said it was raising about $6 billion in combination debt and equity and suspend its dividend payouts.  The energy index jumped 4%, boosted by a rebound in prices from 18-year lows after the United States and Russia agreed to discuss stabilizing energy markets.  Advancing issues almost matched decliners on the NYSE and on the Nasdaq.  The S&P index recorded one new 52-week high and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded seven new highs and 13 new lows.

Apple never publicly commented last week on why or how it believed its current iPhones for sale in China complied with the court\u2019s order, which concerned patents on software features for switching between apps on a smart phone and resizing photos before setting them as a wallpaper on a phone.  Several media outlets, including CNBC, reported that Apple believed the court\u2019s orders applied only to iPhones running older versions of its iOS operating system. But the court\u2019s orders, a copy of which Qualcomm provided to Reuters, made no mention of operating systems and focussed only on software features.  \u201cApple\u2019s statements following the issuance of the preliminary injunction have been deliberate attempts to obfuscate and misdirect,\u201d Qualcomm\u2019s Rosenberg said in a statement on Monday.

FILE PHOTO: A man walks out of the headquarters of LG Display in Seoul, October 20, 2011. REUTERS\/Jo Yong-Hak\/File Photo  The South Korean panel maker posted its fifth straight quarter of operating losses, as the coronavirus pandemic added to the problems of the industry already grappling with demand falls and a supply glut.  LG Display posted an operating loss of 362 billion won ($294.70 million), better than Refinitiv SmartEstimate\u2019s 390 billion won loss, but nearly triple the operating loss of 132 billion won a year earlier.  Revenue fell 20% to 4.7 trillion won.  LG Display said an increase in working from home and online activities meant demand for products such as monitors, laptops and tablets would increase in the second quarter, but it might not be enough to offset weak demand for TVs and smartphones.  \u201cWe expect volatility in demand to increase down the road,\u201d LG Display said.  Analysts also said the spread of the coronavirus across the globe would lead to further losses.  \u201cIt\u2019s likely that LG Display will continue to have another quarterly loss, reflecting the impact of the coronavirus on North America and Europe, which now have become its epicentre,\u201d Park Kang-ho, an analyst at Daishin Securities, said.  LG Display\u2019s shares ended up 0.5% versus the wider market\u2019s fall of 0.98%. Its earnings announcement was issued after the market close.  TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS  The flat-screen maker also said it delayed production at its new Chinese factory for its advanced organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display to the second quarter, citing difficulties in deploying technical staff because of travel restrictions caused by COVID-19. It had aimed to start production at the factory in Guangzhou in the first quarter.  Although liquid crystal display (LCD) panel prices rose when production was disrupted in China at the peak of the coronavirus outbreak there, the price increases were shortlived as Chinese rivals resumed production, contributing to a supply glut.  Prices for LG Display\u2019s main product, 50-inch LCDs for television sets, rose just over 1% in the quarter from the previous quarter, data from WitsView, part of research provider TrendForce, showed.  To try to stem losses, LG Display has said it will halt domestic production of LCD TV panels by the end of this year.  Samsung Display, a unit of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, said last month it would end all production of LCD panels by the end of this year.","607":"March 4 (Reuters) - Skyworks Solutions Inc, a chip supplier to Apple Inc\u2019s iPhones, said on Wednesday the coronavirus has not significantly disrupted its manufacturing operations, sending its shares up 3%.

FILE PHOTO: Nico Hulkenberg of Germany celebrates with mechanics after winning with his Porsche 919 Hybrid number 19 the Le Mans 24-hour sportscar race in Le Mans, central France, June 14, 2015.  While Volkswagen, the world\u2019s largest automaker, has been rolling out electric vehicles from the ID.3 compact to the high end Porsche Taycan, analysts say it needs a more comprehensive system that integrates electric power with new self-driving and infotainment technologies if it hopes to overtake Tesla.  It has turned to Hitzinger, whose ability to conceptualise clean-sheet designs and manage projects helped Porsche develop a racecar that won the Le Mans endurance race in 2015, 2016, 2017.  After a stint working on Apple\u2019s autonomous cars, Hitzinger now heads up Volkswagen\u2019s \u201cProject Artemis\u201d, named after the Ancient Greek goddess of hunting, with the aim of chasing down electric car pioneer Tesla.  \u201cAt Porsche, I always thought of a vehicle as a comprehensive system. This is a very important point. It is what Tesla does well,\u201d he explained in a video interview.  The task of building a car has gotten more complex with the advent of electric and autonomous driving technologies, forcing new battery-driven powertrains to compete for electricity with camera, radar, and lidar sensors, plus infotainment systems.  Rather than stitching together separately designed systems, Artemis wants to create something new and seamlessly integrated, from the ground up, Hitzinger told Reuters.  \u201cThe idea behind Artemis is to have a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle. When something is optimised, this has knock-on effects and these need to be understood.\u201d  Allocating processing power between propulsion, automated driving and infotainment systems such as satellite navigation and music streaming is a key challenge, he said.  But it\u2019s not the only one.  \u201cThe human-machine interface, the interior design, the exterior design, aerodynamics and the range are all interconnected. If I modify something on the exterior, it will impact the aerodynamics and the efficiency,\u201d Hitzinger said.  Volkswagen Group, whose brands range from budget Seats and Skodas to high-end Audis and Bentleys is now focussing on developing systems that can handle all these new demands.  The car, which is due to be produced in 2024, will make use of components developed for Porsche and Audi\u2019s premium electric vehicle platform, PPE. The group\u2019s factory in Hanover, Germany, is being retooled to build an electric sport-utility vehicle for Audi, Bentley and Porsche.  Having a small team of highly qualified engineers, who are empowered to take decisions unencumbered by the corporate bureaucracy of the Volkswagen empire, should end up producing a better vehicle more quickly.  Project Artemis will have between 200 and 250 staff once Hitzinger is done hiring, up from 10 at present.  \u201cI am putting the team together on a top down basis. The managers come first. Then I look for A-players, who will attract other A-players. I don\u2019t want managers, but people who love to develop technologies, who are prepared to take risks,\u201d he said.  Artemis will seek to draw on existing skills within the Volkswagen Group, such as expertise in making vehicle bodies at Audi, but take the lead in developing new techniques which speed up production and improve the customer experience.  \u201cWe want to set new standards for what a customer can do in a vehicle and how he interacts with the car,\u201d Hitzinger said.  He declined to elaborate on what user experiences the new car would offer, citing the confidential nature of the project.  He also declined to comment on a power struggle unfolding at Volkswagen, which has convened its executive committee to meet on Tuesday to decide whether to extend CEO Herbert Diess\u2019s contract.","609":"SAN FRANCISCO\/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Apple Inc has removed an app that helped Hong Kong protesters track police movements, saying it was used to target officers, after a Chinese state newspaper sharply criticized the U.S. tech giant for allowing the software.  Chief Executive Tim Cook defended the move in the face of criticism for appeasing mainland China, telling Apple workers that \u201cthis decision best protects our users.\u201d  The move to bar the HKmap.live app, which crowdsources the locations of both police and protesters, from its app store plunges Apple into the increasingly fraught political tension between China and the protesters that has also ensnared other U.S. and Hong Kong businesses.  The company only just last week had approved the app after rejecting it earlier this month.  Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google on Thursday said it had dropped a game from its app store that allowed players to pretend they were Hong Kong protesters, saying its policies forbid capitalizing on ongoing sensitive events.  However, Google said it had found no policy violation by HKmap.live, and confirmed that the tracking app was available on its app store.  The Chinese Communist Party\u2019s official newspaper on Tuesday called the tracking app \u201cpoisonous\u201d and decried what it said was Apple\u2019s complicity in helping the Hong Kong protesters.  Apple said in a statement on Wednesday it had begun an immediate investigation after \u201cmany concerned customers in Hong Kong\u201d contacted it about the app and Apple found it had endangered law enforcement and residents.  \u201cThe app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement,\u201d it said.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  Apple did not comment beyond its statement. The company also removed BackupHK, a separate app that served as a mirror of the HKmap.live app.  \u2018PRESSURE\u2019  Maya Wang, a senior China researcher with Human Rights Watch, said there could be legitimate concerns of misuse of apps but that the statement from Apple was \u201cdisingenuous\u201d because it did not make any reference to pressure from Beijing in the People\u2019s Daily commentary.  \u201cGiven the context of how (Apple) has over the years removed apps and removed access to news particularly inside mainland China that the Chinese government doesn\u2019t want, I think that the removal of this particular app strikes me as another shameful incident in which a multinational company bends to Chinese government pressure,\u201d she said.  Republican U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn said, \u201cApple and American companies should not fold to a communist regime\u2019s demands to shut down democracy activists.\u201d  Cook, in a letter to company workers, said it was a difficult decision.  \u201cNational and international debates will outlive us all, and, while important, they do not govern the facts,\u201d he said. The app was being used maliciously to target individual police officers and to victimize individuals and property, and so was in violation of Hong Kong law, he said.  On Twitter, an account believed to be owned by the HKmap.live app\u2019s developer said it disagreed with Apple\u2019s decision and that there was no evidence to support the Hong Kong police\u2019s claims that the app had been used in ambushes.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  \u201cThe majority of user review(s) in App Store ... suggest HKmap IMPROVED public safety, not the opposite,\u201d it said.  The app consolidates content from public posts on social networks and moderators delete content that solicits criminal activity and would ban repeated attempts to post such content in the app, it added.  Neither China\u2019s foreign ministry nor the information office of the State Council had an immediate comment when asked about the HKmap.live app removal. Hong Kong police also had no immediate comment.  Separately, Apple removed the Quartz news app from its App Store in China because authorities said it violated local laws.  Quartz Chief Executive Zach Seward told technology publication The Verge in a statement: \u201cWe abhor this kind of government censorship of the internet, and have great coverage of how to get around such bans around the world.\u201d  A Google spokesman said \u201cThe Revolution Of Our Times\u201d app recently pulled from its app store, which lets users role play as Hong Kong protesters, violated a long-standing policy \u201cprohibiting developers from capitalizing on sensitive events, such as attempting to make money from serious ongoing conflicts or tragedies through a game.\u201d  ANGER IN HONG KONG  The People\u2019s Daily newspaper, in its commentary on Tuesday, said Apple did not have a sense of right and wrong, and ignored the truth. Making the app available on Apple\u2019s Hong Kong App Store at this time was \u201copening the door\u201d to violent protesters in the former British colony, the newspaper wrote.  The HKmap.live app was taken down from Apple\u2019s App Store globally on Wednesday but continued to work for users who had previously downloaded it in Hong Kong, Reuters found. A web version of HKmap.live was still viewable on iPhones.  Word of its removal spread quickly in Hong Kong, where residents had been campaigning for months, in sometimes violent demonstrations, initially to protest a now-withdrawn extradition bill and now in a broader push for democratic rights.  \u201cDoes the entire world have to suck up to the garbage Communist Party?\u201d one commentator, Yip Lou Jie, said in an online forum, LIHKG, used by protesters in Hong Kong.  But Simon Young, associate dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Hong Kong, said Apple seemed to have a case, given the circumstances.  \u201cIt sounds like they are being responsible. To do nothing when it\u2019s being used for a specific purpose that actually facilitates these protests, to do nothing would be rather irresponsible,\u201d he said.  Apple\u2019s action has come amid a furor surrounding the U.S. National Basketball Association after a team official tweeted in support of the protests in Hong Kong, which led Chinese sponsors and partners to cut ties with the NBA.","610":"Jan 2 (Reuters) - Billionaire Warren Buffett has said he would love to see Apple Inc shares decline in price so he could buy more. He is getting his wish.  Apple\u2019s warning on Wednesday about weak iPhone demand in the holiday quarter due to slower sales in China sent its stock down 7.5 percent during after-hours trading. Class B shares of Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc traded down 2 percent in the same session on Wall Street.  Buffett, the folksy Nebraska investor known more for buying railroads, energy firms and classic American corporate brands than for his acumen picking tech stocks, in recent years has lamented missing the boat on buying shares in U.S. technology giants. He admitted an earlier investment in IBM Corp was not one of his best.  Yet Buffett has made Apple a centerpiece of his portfolio of other company\u2019s stocks, touting his own use of the Cupertino, California-based company\u2019s products and saying at his annual shareholders\u2019 meeting in Omaha last May, \u201cWe would love to see Apple go down in price,\u201d so he could buy more at a bargain.  Buffett sees Apple more as a consumer stock than a tech stock, reflecting the iPhone\u2019s status as a must-have possession for so many people.  Including its after-hours drop on Wednesday, Apple\u2019s stock market value has tumbled to below $700 billion from over $1.1 trillion at its peak in October. Although Apple has fallen behind Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp in value, it remains one of Wall Street\u2019s most widely held companies.  Shares of Berkshire itself have held up well even as the broader market sank last quarter. Last year, Berkshire returned 2.8 percent, while the S&P 500 fell 4.4 percent, including reinvested dividends.  But the $3 billion hit to Berkshire\u2019s Apple shares in evening trading on Wednesday could show in future reported earnings. Those figures do not reflect any long-term gains on Berkshire\u2019s investments, and Buffett has encouraged investors to ignore the profit statistic mandated by U.S. accounting practices.

A warning from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), the world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker and an Apple supplier, on soft demand for smartphones and on the semiconductor industry\u2019s growth this year sparked a tumble in chip stocks.  Apple\u2019s shares also fell 2.3 percent, with analysts telling Reuters that TSMC\u2019s warning was related to the iPhone maker.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  In an interview with Reuters, European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager also signaled that Google and Amazon would remain very much on her radar until the end of her mandate late next year.  Google has been fined a total of 6.8 billion euros ($7.7 billion) in the last 18 months for breaching EU rules.  Apple\u2019s mobile payment service Apple Pay, launched in October 2014, is available in 10 EU countries including France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Denmark.  Critics say that an NFC chip embedded in the Apple iPhone means that Apple Pay is automatically selected when an iPhone user pays for goods and services, barring rival payment methods. The Danish Competition Authority is investigating the issue, which was brought to its attention by the Danish Consumer Council.  Vestager, who has earned a reputation for taking a tough line against companies that breach EU rules and can impose fines of up to 10 percent of a company\u2019s global turnover, said she did a preliminary review some time back.  \u201cWhen we were looking at it ... (at) first glance, we couldn\u2019t see Apple being dominant. That doesn\u2019t exclude in the future that we will have a second look. But when we looked some time ago, we didn\u2019t find ... the necessary (evidence) to start a case,\u201d she said.  \u201cObviously if we had official complaints, we would take that seriously because the entire payment market is a very important payment market.\u201d  A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.  Separately Vestager is reviewing whether Amazon is using merchants\u2019 data illegally to make its own brand products similar to retailers\u2019. She said she has been inundated with data, key to building a case against the U.S. online retailer.  \u201cNow we have received not piles, but mountains of data and for us it is a priority to go through that, both from Amazon themselves but also coming in from some of the businesses that they actually host,\u201d she said.  \u201cFor us, of course it is important to get the starting point right because, if we open a case, in order to be able to proceed with some speed, well then of course we need to get some of the basics right and we are in the process of doing that.\u201d  Vestager recently asked Google\u2019s rivals if the internet search engine unfairly demotes local search competitors, raising the possibility of a fourth antitrust case against the company.  \u201cNow we ask questions when it comes to local search. This means a lot to many people because you use your phone or your table, you are looking for a place to eat, opening hours, where to go, museums, doctors, all kinds of stuff, and therefore of course it is a very important area, a very important service,\u201d she said.  \u201cIt could be (a fourth case against Google) but of course we start asking questions without prejudice.\u201d","617":"FILE PHOTO - Japan Display Inc's logo is pictured at its headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, August 9, 2016. REUTERS\/Kim Kyung-Hoon\/File Photo  TOKYO (Reuters) - Ailing Apple supplier Japan Display Inc will receive up to 80 billion yen ($723 million) in a bailout from a group of Chinese and Taiwanese investors, Kyodo news agency reported.  A group including China\u2019s state-backed Silk Road Fund and Taiwanese panel maker TPK Holding Co will inject around 60 billion to 80 billion yen, taking a stake of 30-50 percent in Japan Display, Kyodo said, without citing sources.  The deal, if realized, would make the group the top shareholder of the liquid crystal display (LCD) maker, replacing the Japanese government-backed INCJ fund, which currently owns 25.3 percent of the company, the report said on Tuesday.  A spokesman for Japan Display declined to comment, while Silk Road Fund and TPK Holding did not immediately reply to emailed requests for comment.  The Wall Street Journal has previously reported that the size of the group\u2019s investment in Japan Display could reach around 60 billion yen. It also reported that Silk Road Fund had denied it had been in talks with Japan Display.  A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that Japan Display has been in talks with multiple investors over the investment and is aiming to clinch a deal by the end of March.  But the source, who declined to be identified because the talks are private, did not give details of the potential deal.  The Apple Inc supplier has struggled with losses due to competition from cut-price Chinese players and slowing growth in smartphone demand.  Its delayed adoption of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens has also battered the LCD maker, as Apple opted for OLED screens for its iPhoneX and bought them from rival Samsung Electronics Co.","618":"FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc. logo is shown outside the company's 2016 Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, California, U.S. June 13, 2016.

The ruling will not go into immediate effect if Apple appeals, judge Matthias Zigann told the court.  The German case is Qualcomm\u2019s third major effort to secure a ban on Apple\u2019s lucrative iPhones over patent infringement allegations after similar court efforts in the United States and in China, one of which resulted in Chinese court ordering a ban on sales of some iPhones there earlier this month.","620":"Feb 28 (Reuters) - Apple Inc is closely watching how the coronavirus outbreak is unfolding in South Korea and Italy where the company has suppliers, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in an interview with the Fox Business Network.

(Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)","621":"April 15 (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Wednesday released a smaller iPhone priced at $399, cutting the starting price for the company\u2019s smartphone line in a move to broaden its appeal to budget-conscious customers as the coronavirus hobbles the global economy.  The lower-cost model could also attract more consumers to Apple services, a growing driver of revenue.  The iPhone SE, available April 24, is the second generation of a previous value model. It will start at $50 less than what was previously the cheapest iPhone available, the $449 iPhone 8, which will be retired. The SE comes with a 4.7-inch display and the same processor chip as Apple\u2019s most advanced phone, the 11 Pro. The SE lacks 5G capability and Apple\u2019s facial recognition system to unlock the device, instead relying on a fingerprint sensor similar to older models.  The announcement comes as the United States and much of the world is reeling from the novel coronavirus, although U.S. political leaders have begun to talk about ending stay-at-home orders and restarting the economy, hoping record deaths and falling hospitalizations represent a peak.  Every previous iPhone has been unveiled in a polished presentation in front of fans, but large events remain banned in Apple\u2019s home base of Santa Clara County, California, where public officials ordered the first lockdowns in the United States to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.  Apple\u2019s cheaper phone reflects the coronavirus-driven economic downturn and job loss.  The cheaper phone enters a cut-throat market for value phones, especially in China, where Apple derives about 17% of sales. While the new iPhone adds features such as wireless charging and a high-end camera, it lacks connectivity for 5G, the next generation of mobile data networks. In China, rivals such as Xiaomi Corp last month announced models with 5G features starting at about $425.  With wavering hardware sales, Apple has been investing in subscription services such as its Apple TV+ streaming television service, Apple Music and iCloud. The new SE will come bundled with a one free year of the streaming television service, similar to Apple\u2019s flagship devices released last fall.  Apple said in January that it had 1.5 billion active installed devices and 480 million subscribers to both its own and third-party paid services, compared with 1.4 billion devices and 360 million subscribers a year earlier.  The company also set out a goal to reach 600 million paid subscribers by the end of calendar 2020.  The coronavirus has created a volatile start to the year. Sales in China, the first nation hit by the virus, plunged, then rebounded as the country began to reopen. Sales of 500,000 phones in February rose to 2.5 million phones in March, according to government sales data there.  Apple will begin selling the new model online while its stores around the world are closed, except those within its greater China sales region. Apple will start taking orders for the phone on its website on Friday, with delivery of devices expected to start April 24.  Apple gets about 31% of its sales from its elegant stores and website, with 69% coming from partners such as mobile carriers and other retailers. Apple said partners would decide whether to sell the phones in their physical stores. Many of Apple\u2019s resellers are trying to guide customers toward online sales. Major partners such as Best Buy Inc have reduced their hours, and AT&T Inc has closed about 40% of its U.S. retail stores.","622":"SAN JOSE, California (Reuters) - Qualcomm sought to become the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple\u2019s iPhone to recoup a $1-billion \u201cincentive payment\u201d that Apple insisted on, not to block rivals from the market, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive testified on Friday.  FILE PHOTO: A woman checks her phone at a flagship Apple store at Iconsiam shopping mall in Bangkok, Thailand November 9, 2018. REUTERS\/Soe Zeya Tun  The payment from Qualcomm to Apple - part of a 2011 deal between Apple and Qualcomm - was meant to ease the technical costs of swapping out the iPhone\u2019s then-current Infineon chip with Qualcomm\u2019s, CEO Steve Mollenkopf testified at a trial with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  While such a payment is common in the industry, the size of it was not, Mollenkopf said.  Under the 2011 deal, Qualcomm was named Apple\u2019s sole supplier of modem chips, which help mobile phones connect to wireless data networks, in exchange for which Qualcomm agreed to give Apple a rebate - the exact nature of which has not been disclosed. Apple could choose another supplier but it would lose the rebate, effectively increasing the cost of its chips.  Antitrust regulators have argued the deal with Apple was part of a pattern of anticompetitive conduct by Qualcomm to preserve its dominance in modem chips and exclude players like Intel.  At a federal courthouse in San Jose, California, Mollenkopf testified that Apple demanded the $1 billion without any assurance of how many chips it would buy, which pushed the chip supplier to pursue an exclusivity arrangement in order to ensure it sold enough chips to recover the payment.  Qualcomm was not aiming to block rivals like Intel, he said.  \u201cThe risk was, what would the volume be? Would we get everything we wanted, given that we paid so much in incentive?\u201d Mollenkopf testified.  Earlier in the day, Apple supply chain executive Tony Blevins testified that it was Apple\u2019s practice to pursue at least two suppliers and as many as six for each of the more than 1,000 components in the iPhone.  The company stopped trying to place an Intel modem chip in the iPad Mini 2 because losing the rebates on Qualcomm\u2019s chips would have made the overall cost too high, he said.  \u201cThey made it very unattractive for us to use another chip supplier,\u201d Blevins said of the rebates. \u201cThese rebates were very, very large.\u201d","623":"SAN FRANCISCO\/BENGALURU\/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Wednesday took the rare step of cutting its quarterly sales forecast, with Chief Executive Tim Cook blaming slowing iPhone sales in China, whose economy has been dragged down by uncertainty around U.S.-China trade relations.  The news, which comes as a spotlight grows on Beijing\u2019s attempts to revive stalling growth, sent Apple shares tumbling in after-hours trade, hammered Asian suppliers and triggered a broader selloff in global markets.  The revenue drop for the just-ended quarter underscores how an economic slowdown in China has been sharper than many expected, catching companies and leaders in Beijing off balance and forcing some to readjust their plans in the market.  \u201cWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a letter to investors.  Apple finds itself in a tricky position in China, a key market for sales and where it manufactures the bulk of the iconic products it sells worldwide, after the high-profile arrest in Canada of the CFO of domestic rival Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL].  Since the arrest last month, at the request of the United States, there have been sporadic reports of Chinese consumers shying away from Apple products. Even before then, local rivals like Huawei had been gaining market share over Apple.  Cook told CNBC that Apple products have not been targeted by the Chinese government, though some consumers may have elected not to buy an iPhone or other Apple devices due to the firm being an American brand.  \u201cThe much larger issue is the slowing of the (Chinese) economy, and then the trade tension that has further pressured it,\u201d Cook said.  PRICE TAG  Some analysts, however, questioned the impact of Apple\u2019s own actions, such as its unyielding pursuit of high selling prices for its products.  \u201cApple sales in China have not been doing well for a few quarters now, part of the reason is that their price points have gone too high - past the $1,000 mark,\u201d said Kiranjeet Kaur, an analyst at market research firm IDC.  \u201c(That\u2019s) almost three times as expensive as phones from other vendors that are filling the mass market.\u201d  China\u2019s smartphone market has dropped sharply this year, with Apple and South Korean rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd leading the fall, even as some domestic peers have performed more strongly.  (Apple, Samsung lead China smartphone drop: tmsnrt.rs\/2PdBGNw)  Samsung said last month it would cease operations at one of its mobile phone manufacturing plants in China, after seeing its share of the Chinese market drop to 1 percent in the first quarter of 2018 versus 15 percent in mid-2013.  FORECAST CUT  Apple on Wednesday lowered its forecast to $84 billion in revenue for its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 29, below analysts\u2019 estimate of $91.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Apple originally forecast revenue of between $89 billion and $93 billion.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  This marked the first time Apple had issued a warning on its revenue guidance ahead of releasing quarterly results since the iPhone was launched in 2007.  Apple shares skidded 7.7 percent in after-hours trade, dragging the company\u2019s market value below $700 billion. In the broader market, the S&P 500 futures fell 1.5 percent. In the U.S. government bond market, a typical safe-haven, the yield on the benchmark 10-year, which moves inversely to the bond\u2019s price, sank to an 11-month low.  PRECURSORS TO A WARNING  Apple\u2019s move was not entirely a surprise. In November, the Cupertino, California-based company said it would quit disclosing unit sales data for iPhones and other hardware items, leading many analysts to worry that a drop in iPhone sales was coming. And after several component makers in November forecast weaker-than-expected sales, some market watchers called the peak for iPhones in several key markets.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  In November, Cook cited slowing growth in emerging markets such as Brazil, India and Russia for lower-than-anticipated sales estimates for the company\u2019s fiscal first quarter. But Cook specifically said he \u201cwould not put China in that category\u201d of countries with troubled growth.  That all came before the damage to the Chinese economy from trade tensions with the United States and long-simmering structural issues became evident.  Apple is now the highest-profile multinational corporation to warn that the economic slowdown in China could hurt its business. Automakers such as Ford Motor Co, Hyundai Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co Ltd all previously said they planned to cut production in the country.  But Apple has held firm on its premium pricing strategy in China despite the risk of a slower economy.  \u201cThe question for investors will be the extent to which Apple\u2019s aggressive pricing has exacerbated this situation and what this means for the company\u2019s longer-term pricing power within its iPhone franchise,\u201d James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, told Reuters.  In the latest fiscal year, ended Sept. 29, unit sales of the iPhone were essentially flat from the prior year, while iPhone revenue expanded 18 percent to $166.7 billion. That growth came entirely from higher prices.  Hal Eddins, chief economist at Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said Cook\u2019s comments on the impact of the U.S. trade tensions with China \u201cmight be a dig at (U.S. President Donald) Trump, but mostly he may be using the trade turmoil as an excuse for some missteps they\u2019ve made over the last year.\u201d  But some investors were heartened by Apple\u2019s plans on using its cash pile.  In his letter, Cook said Apple has $130 billion in net cash and that it intends to continue its efforts to reduce that cash balance to net zero, which the company has so far accomplished through dividend increases and share buybacks.  \u201cWe would anticipate the company increasing share buybacks on the weakness to return capital to shareholders at discount prices,\u201d said Trip Miller, managing partner at Apple shareholder Gullane Capital Partners.","624":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window.)  * Apple drops after warnings on sales  * Walmart forecasts downbeat online sales growth  * Kroger jumps as Berkshire Hathaway reveals $549 mln stake  * Futures down: Dow 0.51%, S&P 0.39%, Nasdaq 0.54% (Adds comment, details; updates prices)  Feb 18 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set to open lower on Tuesday as a surprise sales warning from bellwether Apple fanned worries about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on global supply chains.  The world\u2019s most valuable technology firm said it was unlikely to meet its March-quarter sales guidance because of slower iPhone production and weaker demand in China, sending its shares down 2.3% in premarket trading.  The news also sent shares of Apple suppliers, including Qualcomm Inc, Broadcom Inc, Qorvo Inc and Skyworks Solutions Inc, lower by 1.4% to 2.3%.  Apple\u2019s warning highlights issues that will eventually hurt a lot of companies with exposure to China, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.  \u201cIt has shifted people\u2019s focus back to the ultimate economic damage in the wake of this coronavirus,\u201d Hogan said.  While the exact hit to growth from the epidemic in China - the global manufacturing hub - still remains to be seen, hopes that the damage would only be temporary have helped Wall Street\u2019s main indexes clinch record highs as early as last week.  Offering some relief to investors on Tuesday was China\u2019s promise to grant exemptions on retaliatory duties imposed against 696 U.S. goods, as Beijing seeks to fulfill commitments made in its interim trade deal with the United States.

Buying was particularly strong in recently beaten-down stocks, with 32 of the Topix\u2019s 33 subsectors in positive territory.  Automakers gained ground, with Honda Motor advancing 3.1 percent and Nissan Motor gaining 1.6 percent.  SoftBank Group Corp, which booked strong earnings for July-September, pulled back 2.0 percent after soaring as much as 4 percent in early trade.

Apple Inc shares rose on Monday and early in Tuesday\u2019s session, giving the indexes a boost. But Apple turned slightly lower in the wake of its product event, which included the rollout of a new virtual fitness service and a bundle of all its subscriptions, Apple One.

The iPhone maker is appealing to Europe\u2019s second highest court to overturn the European Commission\u2019s 2016 ruling that it pay the record sum to Ireland.  Ireland, whose economy has benefited from investment by multinational companies attracted by low tax rates, is also challenging the Commission\u2019s decision.  Apple also accused the Commission of using its powers to combat state aid \u201cto retrofit changes to national law\u201d, in effect trying to change the international tax system and in the process creating legal uncertainty for businesses.  The EU executive dismissed the arguments, saying it was not seeking to police international tax laws and accused Ireland of not having done its homework when assessing Apple\u2019s taxes.  Apple\u2019s arguments at the General Court, Europe\u2019s second-highest, came after the EU executive in 2016 said the tech giant benefited from illegal state aid due to two Irish tax rulings which artificially reduced its tax burden for over two decades.  The case could make or break European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager\u2019s campaign which has also led to action against Starbucks, Fiat, Engie, Amazon and others.  Apple\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri led a six-strong delegation to the court where a panel of five judges will hear arguments over two days.  \u201cThe Commission contends that essentially all of Apple\u2019s profits from all of its sales outside the Americas must be attributed to two branches in Ireland,\u201d Apple\u2019s lawyer Daniel Beard told the court.  FILE PHOTO: The Apple logo is displayed at an event at their headquarters in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 10, 2019. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  He said the fact the iPhone, the iPad, the App Store, other Apple products and services and key intellectual property rights were developed in the United States, and not in Ireland, showed the flaws in the Commission\u2019s case.  \u201cThe branches\u2019 activities did not involve creating, developing or managing those rights. Based on the facts of this case, the primary line defies reality and common sense,\u201d Beard said.  \u201cThe activities of these two branches in Ireland simply could not be responsible for generating almost all of Apple\u2019s profits outside the Americas.\u201d  Beard dismissed criticism of the 0.005% tax rate paid by Apple\u2019s main Irish unit in 2014, which was cited by the Commission in its decision, saying the regulator was just seeking \u201cheadlines by quoting tiny numbers\u201d.  \u2018PERFECTLY IRRELEVANT\u2019  Paying an average global tax rate of 26%, Apple has said it is the largest taxpayer worldwide and is now paying around 20 billion euros in U.S. taxes on the same profits that the Commission said should have been taxed in Ireland.  In its current financial quarter, Apple expects revenue of $61-64 billion and a gross margin of 37.5-38.5%.  Commission lawyer Richard Lyal said Apple\u2019s argument that all its intellectual property-related activities take place in the United States was inconsequential.  \u201cTo a large extent that is perfectly correct and perfectly irrelevant,\u201d he said, adding that Ireland was taxing Apple\u2019s Irish subsidiaries, not the group nor Apple Inc.  He said Ireland had failed to examine the functions performed by Apple\u2019s Irish units, the risks assumed and the assets used by the subsidiaries.  \u201cThey simply accepted an arbitrary method proposed by the Apple Ireland subsidiaries. That in itself gives rise to a presumption of a special deal, exceptionally advantageous treatment. It is clear that the tax authorities made no assessment in 1991.\u201d  He said the Commission has no hidden agenda.  \u201cWhat is the case not about? Not about the Commission as policeman of international taxation, not about making sure tax is paid somewhere, though that would be a nice idea, not about resolving tax mismatches,\u201d Lyal said.  Ireland said it had been the subject of entirely unjustified criticism and that the Apple tax case was due to a mismatch between the Irish and U.S. tax systems.  \u201cThe Commission\u2019s decision is fundamentally flawed,\u201d its lawyer Paul Gallagher told the court.  Luxembourg, told by the EU to recover millions of euros in back taxes from Amazon, Engie and Fiat, is backing Ireland. Poland and the EFTA (European Free Trade Association) Surveillance Authority support the Commission.  The court is expected to rule in the coming months, with the losing party likely to appeal to the EU Court of Justice and a final judgment could take several years.

Trump has slapped import tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods as he seeks concessions from Beijing on issues ranging from industrial subsidies to hacking, sparking retaliation by China. The measures have disrupted trade, hurt manufacturing, roiled international markets and slowed the global economy.

Shares of the iPhone maker jumped 5.3% after the company said sales in China were steadying and touted how rising demand for its services and accessories helped offset a record drop in iPhone revenue.  The company also announced plans for a new $75 billion share buyback and bumped up its cash dividend by 5%, putting it on course to reclaim $1 trillion in market capitalization.

Besides a largely upbeat earnings season, recent gains in shares have also been powered by positive economic data, a dovish Federal Reserve and signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks.

CVS Health Corp jumped 4.2% after the drugstore chain operator and pharmacy benefits manager raised its full-year profit forecast after reporting a quarterly profit beat.  Hilton Worldwide Holdings gained 6.4%, the most among S&P 500 companies, after the hotel operator reported quarterly revenue above analysts expectations.  The healthcare sector fell 0.6%, as shares of Amgen Inc fell 4.2% after the world\u2019s largest biotech reported first-quarter revenue that was unchanged from a year ago.  In economic data, ADP\u2019s National Employment Report showed private employers added 275,000 in April, higher than consensus estimate of 180,000 additions.

Till Quack, who worked at Apple as an engineering manager overseeing augmented reality and self-driving efforts, will become Mapillary\u2019s vice president of product, the company told Reuters. Quack had earlier worked at chipmaker Qualcomm Inc after selling a startup to the San Diego company in 2014.  Mapillary was founded after CEO Jan Erik Solem himself left Apple in 2013 after selling his facial recognition startup, Polar Rose, to the iPhone maker in 2010. Mapillary aims to solve one of the most expensive problems in mapping: keeping maps up to date with so-called \u201cstreet level data\u201d about street signs, addresses and other information that can be observed from the road.  The way big companies such as Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Apple Inc solve the problem is by sending out fleets of vehicles outfitted with cameras and other sensors to gather images of the roads and keep maps updated.  Mapillary\u2019s approach is to take software that can ingest pictures from nearly any kind of camera, such as a smart phone or a GoPro action camera, and use so-called \u201ccomputer vision\u201d technology to stitch that together into a three-dimensional map. The company provides that capability to mapping firms, such as HERE Technologies, the mapping firm owned by a consortium of German automakers.  Solem said Quack\u2019s job will be in charge of helping the company\u2019s customers keep their maps updated. The startup is already experimenting with using the comparatively low-resolution cameras that are built into many vehicles for features such as lane control to help update high-resolution maps.  \u201cThe main product that we build is the platform to convert imagery from anyone into map data we can publish for everyone,\u201d Solem said.  Mapping is expected to be a key component of self-driving car technology. Startups such as Mapbox Civil Maps, DeepMap and Lvl5 working on such technology have raised more than $270 million in venture capital. For its part, Mapillary has raised $24.5 million from investors such as Sequoia Capital and BMW Group\u2019s iVentures.","641":"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp\u2019s stock market value surpassed Apple Inc\u2019s and pulled ahead by as much as $3 billion on Wednesday as the Windows software maker benefited from optimism about demand for cloud computing services.

Both companies\u2019 market capitalizations were calculated using outstanding shares reported in their most recent 10-Q filings.  Apple\u2019s market capitalization overtook Microsoft\u2019s in 2010 as the Windows seller struggled with slow demand for personal computers, due in part to the explosion of smartphones driven by Apple\u2019s iPhone.  Since then, Microsoft has not ended an official trading session with a stock market value greater than Apple\u2019s.  Shares of several cloud software makers also rose on Wednesday after Salesforce.com Inc\u2019s upbeat quarterly earnings boosted Wall Street\u2019s expectations for the fast-growing sector, which faced pressure in the recent selloff in technology stocks.  Since Satya Nadella took over as chief executive in 2014, Microsoft has reduced its reliance on Windows software for PCs and became a major player in cloud computing, second only to Amazon.com.  In recent months, technology shares have been punished due to investor worries about rising interest rates and fallout from the trade war between the United States and China.  But Apple has suffered more than other Silicon Valley stalwarts, down 19 percent since the iPhone maker warned on Nov. 1 that sales for the crucial holiday quarter would likely miss Wall Street expectations.  Global demand for smartphones has slowed in recent years, making it more difficult for Apple to increase its revenue.  Thirty-three analysts recommend buying Microsoft\u2019s stock, while just one has a negative rating and another has a neutral rating, according to Refinitiv data.

Cook, who has a strong relationship with Trump, has sought relief for Apple from the U.S. tariffs, which are part of a months-long tit-for-tat trade war between the world\u2019s largest economies.  \u201cThe problem we have is you have Samsung. It\u2019s a great company but it\u2019s a competitor of Apple, and it\u2019s not fair if, because we have a trade deal with Korea - we made a great trade deal with South Korea - but we have to treat Apple on a somewhat similar basis as we treat Samsung,\u201d Trump said.  Apple announced in September it would make its new Mac Pro computers in Austin. The announcement came days after U.S. trade regulators approved 10 out of 15 requests for tariff exemptions filed by Apple amid a broader reprieve on levies on computer parts.  Earlier this month, Apple also asked the Trump administration to waive tariffs on Chinese-made Apple Watches, iPhone components and other consumer products.  Trump has made boosting the U.S. manufacturing sector one of the goals of his presidency, taking to Twitter to pressure U.S. companies into keeping jobs at home.  Earlier on Wednesday, Apple said it had started construction of a new campus in Austin that will employ 5,000 workers, with the capacity to grow to 15,000. It is expected to open in 2022.","644":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in an Eikon news window.)  * Apple tumbles on sales forecast cut, blames China  * Futures slide: Dow 1.39 pct, S&P 1.36 pct, Nasdaq 2.10 pct  * Chipmakers, mainly Apple suppliers lead decliners  * Trade-sensitive Boeing and Caterpillar also fall  * Celgene soars on Bristol-Myers\u2019 $74 bln deal (Adds comments, updates prices)  Jan 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures tumbled on Thursday after Apple Inc stunned investors with a rare sales warning that inflamed fears that the Sino-U.S. trade war and a slowing China economy would eat into corporate profits more than expected.  Apple\u2019s shares sank 8.2 percent before the bell after the company slashed its holiday-quarter revenue forecast due to slowing iPhone sales in China, the first major warning with the U.S. earnings season around the corner.  \u201cThis provides solid evidence of how slowing economic growth and a trade war make the best death cocktail for sentiment,\u201d said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK Ltd in London.  The warning from Apple, whose stock is a member of all the three major Wall Street indexes, rocked financial markets, as investors sought safety in bonds and less risky assets.  At 7:49 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 324 points, or 1.39 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were down 34.25 points, or 1.36 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 134 points, or 2.1 percent.  Apple\u2019s slide is a gloomy omen for Wall Street bulls hoping for an early gift in 2019 following December\u2019s steep selloff, which President Donald Trump has called a \u201cglitch\u201d.  Though the selloff has made stocks cheaper, with the S&P 500\u2019s valuation now at 14 times expected earnings from 18 times a year earlier, earnings estimates have also been sharply cut.  Analysts on average expect S&P 500 companies to increase their earnings per share by nearly 7 percent this year, down from a forecast of 10 percent at the start of October and far below their expectations of 24 percent EPS growth for 2018, according to Refinitiv\u2019s IBES.  Apple\u2019s warning on China has the potential to weigh heavily on a wide variety of companies, ranging from its suppliers to companies that rely on China for a major portion of their sales.  Chipmakers, which count both Apple and China as major customers, led the decliners in early premarket trading, with Intel Corp, Micron Technology Inc and Nvidia Corp falling between 2.3 percent and 4.6 percent.  Trade bellwethers Boeing Co and Caterpillar Inc dropped over 2 percent.  The United States and China are about one month into a 90-day tariff ceasefire to negotiate a deal. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday the talks were going \u201cvery well\u201d and that the stock market would rise once various trade deals are settled.  Apple\u2019s warning follows data earlier this week that showed a deceleration in factory activity in China and the euro zone, indicating the ongoing trade dispute was taking a toll on global manufacturing.  The impact on U.S. activity will be clear later on Thursday. At 10 a.m. ET, the Institute of Supply Management is expected to report its index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 57.9 in December from 59.3 in November.  Before that, at 8:15 a.m. ET, the ADP National Employment Report is expected to show private payrolls rose by 178,000 jobs in December. The report comes ahead of the more comprehensive nonfarm payrolls report on Friday.  Among stocks, Celgene Corp jumped 31.9 percent after Bristol-Myers Squibb Co offered to buy the drugmaker for about $74 billion in a cash-and-stock deal. Bristol-Myers fell 13.6 percent.

Apple Inc shares rose 1.1% after Morgan Stanley said the iPhone maker\u2019s soon-to-be-launched video streaming service, Apple TV+, could boost its services revenue.  But tit-for-tat tariffs by Washington and Beijing prompted profit and revenue warnings from Texas Instruments and Caterpillar Inc.  Texas Instruments, seen as a proxy for the microchip sector, dropped 6%, weighing on the Philadelphia Semiconductor index , while Caterpillar shares were flat.  \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear there were some tough numbers coming out from bellwether type names like Caterpillar and Boeing, and certainly in the case of Boeing, people are shrugging it off,\u201d said Josh Wein, portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.  Boeing\u2019s shares rose 0.7%, lifting the blue-chip Dow Jones index, after the world\u2019s largest planemaker reaffirmed the timeline for its grounded 737 MAX\u2019s return to service, as investors looked past quarterly profit that more than halved.  The S&P 500 has hovered near its record high this week after signs of progress in trade talks between the world\u2019s top two economies.

The earnings season has largely been upbeat, with more than 82% of the 124 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far surpassing earnings expectations, according to Refinitiv data. But analysts still project the first earnings contraction since 2016.  At 12:47 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 14.19 points, or 0.05%, at 26,802.29 and the S&P 500 was up 3.96 points, or 0.13%, at 2,999.95.  The Nasdaq Composite was up 7.93 points, or 0.10%, at 8,112.23. A 1.4% gain in Facebook boosted the tech heavy index after CEO Mark Zuckerberg sought to reassure U.S. lawmakers about the company\u2019s planned digital currency, Libra.  A handful of healthcare companies with low exposure to China rose on strong results, helping the S&P 500 healthcare sector climb 0.7%. Health insurer Anthem Inc and medical device makers Boston Scientific Corp, Thermo Fisher Scientific all gained between 3% and 6% after reporting better-than-expected quarterly profits.  However, Eli Lilly and Co fell 2.4% after the drugmaker missed third-quarter revenue estimates.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.74-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.30-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.  The S&P index recorded 14 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 40 new highs and 48 new lows.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Activist hedge fund Jana Partners sold out of its position in major Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and reduced its stake in Apple by approximately 175,000 shares, slicing its position in the company by 63 percent.  Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc shrank its Apple stake to 249.6 million shares from 252.5 million shares in the fourth quarter. Buffett\u2019s assistant Debbie Bosanek said in an email to Reuters: \u201cOne of the managers other than Warren had a position in Apple and sold part of it in order to make an unrelated purchase. None of the shares under Warren\u2019s direction have ever been sold.\u201d  Soros Fund Management and David Tepper\u2019s Appaloosa Management sold out of their stakes in Apple.  Third Point LLC sold all of its shares of Alibaba and in streaming company Netflix Inc, while reducing its stake in payments company Visa Inc by approximately 200,000 shares, or about 11 percent of its prior position.  Omega Advisors, run by billionaire Leon Cooperman, sold all of its approximately 88,000 shares of Facebook and reduced its stake in Google-parent Alphabet Inc by approximately a third by selling approximately 47,600 shares.  The moves came during a volatile fourth quarter in which fears of slowing economic growth pushed the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 index to the brink of a bear market while stock indexes in China and Germany finished the year down 20 percent or more.  Since then, shares have rebounded sharply on a broad global rally powered by hopes of a new trade deal between the United States and China and the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to slow its pace of U.S. interest rate hikes.  Alibaba is up nearly 23 percent since the start of January, while Netflix is up nearly 34 percent over the same time. Those gains helped power the average hedge fund in January to the largest monthly gain since September 2010, according to Hedge Fund Research.  \u201cWhile investor optimism dominated in January, significant macroeconomic uncertainty still exists, increasing the likelihood that recent trends toward elevated realized volatility will remain and continue to drive industry performance,\u201d said Kenneth J. Heinz, president of HFR.  Quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers\u2019 stock holdings in 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are one of the few public ways of tracking what hedge fund managers are selling and buying. But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some risk because the disclosures are made 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions.  Along with the sell-off among technology stocks, hedge fund managers added new positions in companies ranging from Mastercard Inc to Salesforce.Com Inc.  Jana Partners added a new position in Salesforce.com by buying approximately 115,000 shares, while Third Point increased its stake in the company by 135 percent by adding another 675,000 shares. Shares of the company are up 16.6 percent since the start of the year.  Tiger Global added a new position in information technology infrastructure management company Solarwinds Corp. Shares of the $5.7 billion market cap company are up 35 percent for the year. Omega Advisors, meanwhile, doubled its stake in CVS Health Corp by buying approximately 401,000 shares. Shares of the company are up 3.7 percent for the year to date.","648":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s competition watchdog said on Wednesday that Apple Inc has committed to be \u201cclearer and more upfront\u201d with iPhone users about battery health and performance, after the regulator looked into consumer concerns on the matter.  The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it raised consumer law concerns with the tech company last year after finding people were not being warned clearly that their phone\u2019s performance could slow down following a 2017 software update designed to manage demands on the battery.  The iPhone maker previously came under scrutiny after it said in 2017 that software to deal with ageing batteries in iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE models could slow down performance. The company later apologized and lowered the price of battery replacements for affected models to $29 from $79.  \u201cThe CMA became concerned that people might have tried to repair their phone or replace it because they weren\u2019t aware the software update had caused the handset to slow down,\u201d it said, adding that people were not able to easily find information about the health of their phone\u2019s battery, \u201cwhich can degrade over time\u201d.  Since the CMA raised its concerns, Apple had already started to be more upfront with iPhone users, the regulator said.  Apple was fined by Italy\u2019s anti-trust watchdog in October last year for failing to give customers clear information about how to maintain or when to replace batteries, following complaints that the company used software updates to slow down their mobile phones.","649":"FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc. logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, New York, U.S., October 16, 2019.

Apple said it would expand the App Store to 20 countries, eight of them in Africa, and will offer its streaming Apple Music service in 52 additional countries and regions. The expansion is the largest since Apple grew what was then called the iTunes Store to India, Russia and more than 50 other countries in 2012.  Apple has focused on growing sales from its services segment, which totaled 17.8% of its $260.1 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year, as consumers have slowed in upgrading their smart phones. Apple executives said in January that the company had an installed base of 1.5 billion active devices and aimed to reach 600 million subscribers to either its own or third-party services by the end of this year.  Apple\u2019s biggest services revenue generator is the App Store, where it keeps a cut of between 15% and 30% of sales. In Africa, the store will expand to Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Libya, Morocco, Rwanda and Zambia. It will also become available in the Maldives and Myanmar in the Asia-Pacific region, Afghanistan and Iraq in the Middle East, and several nations in the Balkans and Oceania, for a total of 175 countries.  The company is also expanding its Apple Music service, bringing the total to 167 markets. Apple's top streaming rival, Spotify Technology SA SPOT.N, operates in 79 countries.  Apple will have different terms and pricing for streaming music in the new markets. In the United States, Apple offers a three-month free trial and charges individual users $9.99 a month thereafter. In the new markets, Apple will offer a six-month trial period and adjust monthly prices Ivory Coast and Myanmar, and $4.99 in markets such as Iraq and Kuwait.","650":"FILE PHOTO: Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, plays bridge as part of the company annual meeting weekend in Omaha, Nebraska U.S. May 6, 2018.

Including its after-hours drop on Wednesday, Apple\u2019s stock market value has tumbled to below $700 billion from over $1.1 trillion at its peak in October. Although Apple has fallen behind Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp in value, it remains one of Wall Street\u2019s most widely held companies.

She spoke in Cupertino, California, where the company also announced the launch of a streaming television service and an online gaming arcade.  Cardholders will earn 2 percent cash back on all purchases made using their phones or 3 percent cash back on Apple products.  The physical credit card will be made of titanium - laser-etched with users\u2019 names but no numbers as a security feature. It will pay 1 percent cash back on purchases.  The card, which will be issued by Goldman Sachs Group Inc and will use the Mastercard Inc network, will come with new features in the Apple Wallet to help users track their spending with a breakdown of monthly purchasing.

She did not give specific information on the interest rate cardholders will pay on balances.  Sara Rathner, credit card specialist at financial product comparison site NerdWallet, said there are \u201ca lot of cash-back cards that offer similar benefits\u201d but that the card would be convenient for consumers who purchase a lot of Apple products and services.  Tim Devaney, of free credit score app Credit Karma, said the rewards are competitive but are not what will differentiate the Apple Card. \u201cThe Apple Card is consumer-friendly,\u201d he said, noting features such as a calculator that shows how much interest a consumer will incur by paying a balance over time.  Apple did not say if the new budgeting tool would include cash and credit balances from other accounts, nor if it would come with a sign-up bonus.  The Apple Card is Goldman\u2019s first credit card. The Wall Street investment bank has been offering more products to consumers, including personal loans and savings accounts through its Marcus online bank.  Apple\u2019s Bailey said Goldman will never share or sell consumer data to third parties for marketing.

Tariffs on many Apple products such as AirPods wireless headphones took effect on Sept. 1, with most analysts expecting Apple to absorb the cost of the levies if required to pay them. Apple has not disclosed any financial impacts specifically related to tariffs.  In the meantime, Apple has spent the past several years emphasizing its supplier base in the United States.  Apple announced its fund for U.S. suppliers in 2017, setting aside $1 billion and boosting the figure to $5 billion a year later. The company said it spent $60 billion with more than 9,000 U.S. suppliers in 2018.  Counting $200 million in 2017, Corning has now received $450 million from Apple\u2019s fund. Apple said in a statement that its spending with Corning supports 1,000 jobs at Corning, including about 400 manufacturing jobs at the plant in Kentucky.  \u201cThis award underscores Apple and Corning\u2019s shared belief in the vital role that ingenuity plays in creating industry-leading products, and the pride that both companies take in applying American innovation and advanced manufacturing to solve some of the world\u2019s toughest technology challenges,\u201d Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams said in a statement.  Apple has now awarded $1 billion from the fund. Other awards were $390 million to chipmaker Finisar Corp, which makes chips for Apple\u2019s facial recognition technology in Texas, and $10 million for a joint venture between Alcoa Corp and Rio Tinto\u2019s aluminum business to develop a carbon-free aluminum smelting process.","657":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Apple Inc has no interest in acquiring TikTok, the company said on Tuesday, denying a report by news website Axios from earlier in the day.

Stocks swung between gains and losses, as investors were confused about signs of progress despite comments from both sides that they had arrived at an initial agreement.  The S&P 500 tech sector rose 0.8%, with a 1.2% gain in shares of Apple Inc leading advancers. The sector is already the best performer this year with its 44% surge.

U.S. investors also missed out on a global rally fueled by a landslide victory for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson that paves the way for an orderly Brexit and lifts some of the fog on the global economic horizon.  Meanwhile, the U.S. House of Representatives committee approved charges of abuse of power and obstruction against President Donald Trump, making it almost certain he will become the third American president in history to be impeached.

FILE PHOTO: People look at iPhones at the World Trade Center Apple Store during a Black Friday sales event in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., November 23, 2018. REUTERS\/Andrew Kelly  The Cupertino, California-based company is widely expected to launch three new iPhones on Tuesday, featuring upgraded processors and new camera functionality, along with a video streaming service that will take on the likes of Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Walt Disney DIS.N.  The upgrade cycle could translate into roughly 180 million iPhone units sold in the next 12 months with roughly 60 million to 70 million consumers due for an upgrade in China, where Apple struggled with its last launch, Wedbush analysts said.  Apple currently has about 900 million active iPhones globally and the combination of slack sales for its iPhone X launches since 2017 and relatively tight control of pricing may spur demand from users who have been holding out previously, several analysts said.  \u201cThese old phones would be candidates for upgrade and we continue to look at fiscal 2020 as a \u2018Trade-in\u2019 iPhone cycle versus 2021 which should be a 5G-driven cycle,\u201d Bank of America analysts said.  They estimated there were 200 million iPhone 6 and earlier models which were primed for upgrading.  Apple's 2020 fiscal year starts from October and none of the brokerages expected it to launch a 5G-enabled iPhone this time round - in contrast to recent 5G mobile launches by Samsung Electronics 005930.KS and China's OnePlus.  Analysts and other industry watchers expect Apple to launch three smartphones: a 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro, 6.5-inch 11 Pro Max and a low-priced 6.1-inch 11R.  The base model is expected to be priced at $749, the iPhone 11 Pro at $999 and iPhone Pro Max at $1,099, roughly unchanged from last year\u2019s prices, with the company opting to push through any potential tariffs on the devices in favor of boosting sales volumes.  Apple faces here levies of 15% imposed by the U.S. government on products made in China including smartwatches and wireless headphones as of Sept. 1, with a tariff on the iPhone to take effect on Dec. 15.  Apple has seen bumps in demand in China this year, driven by Chinese online retailers discounting iPhones.  \u201cApple saw meaningful elasticity of demand in China when it lowered the price of iPhone XR, and we expect Apple to potentially lower pricing of some models,\u201d the Bank of America analysts said.","660":"April 19 (Reuters) - The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq opened lower after three days of gains on Thursday as technology stocks took a beating from Apple\u2019s decline and weakness in chipmakers.

The Apple Card will sync with iPhone\u2019s users\u2019 Apple Wallet and work through its payment system Apple Pay, said Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay. She spoke in Cupertino, California, where the company also announced the launch of a streaming television service and an online gaming arcade.  Cardholders will earn 2 percent cash back on all purchases made using their phones or 3 percent cash back on Apple products.  The physical credit card will be made of titanium - laser-etched with users\u2019 names but no numbers as a security feature. It will pay 1 percent cash back on purchases.  The card, which will be issued by Goldman Sachs Group Inc and will use the Mastercard Inc network, will come with new features in the Apple Wallet to help users track their spending with a breakdown of monthly purchasing.  Credit card industry analysts said the rewards programs were not significantly different from what is currently available in the market, but that Apple\u2019s broad consumer reach could make it a major player.  \u201cFrankly I am bit underwhelmed,\u201d said Ted Rossman, an analyst at Creditcards.com. \u201cThis card will get a lot of headlines, but its bark is greater than its bite.\u201d  He noted that the rewards for Apple\u2019s card were less attractive than benefits Citigroup Inc offers with its Double Cash Card. The U.S. Bank Altitude Reserve Visa Infinite card gives 3 points per dollar on mobile wallet spending, worth 3 percent cash back or 4.5 percent off travel, he added.  Apple Pay is accepted by 70 percent of U.S. merchants and will be available in more than 40 countries by the end of the year. Commuters in New York, Chicago and Portland, Oregon, will eventually be able to use it to pay for public transportation, Apple said.  Cash back rewards will be credited to Apple Pay users\u2019 accounts on a daily basis, Bailey said, and the card will not charge annual fees, international fees or late fees. She did not give specific information on the interest rate cardholders will pay on balances.  Sara Rathner, credit card specialist at financial product comparison site NerdWallet, said there are \u201ca lot of cash-back cards that offer similar benefits\u201d but that the card would be convenient for consumers who purchase a lot of Apple products and services.  Tim Devaney, of free credit score app Credit Karma, said the rewards are competitive but are not what will differentiate the Apple Card. \u201cThe Apple Card is consumer-friendly,\u201d he said, noting features such as a calculator that shows how much interest a consumer will incur by paying a balance over time.  Apple did not say if the new budgeting tool would include cash and credit balances from other accounts, nor if it would come with a sign-up bonus.  The Apple Card is Goldman\u2019s first credit card. The Wall Street investment bank has been offering more products to consumers, including personal loans and savings accounts through its Marcus online bank.  Apple\u2019s Bailey said Goldman will never share or sell consumer data to third parties for marketing. She added that the card would have privacy features, and Apple would not know what and where a purchase was made or how much it cost.

But Apple is girding for more disruptions in virus-hit China.  Apple Inc AAPL.O on Tuesday reported sales and profits for the holiday shopping quarter above Wall Street expectations, thanks to rising iPhone sales for the first time in a year and soaring demand for add-ons like AirPods wireless headphones.  The performance outweighed concerns about the coronavirus outbreak in China, a major market and manufacturing hub for Apple, and a slight revenue miss in the company\u2019s services business, which includes the new Apple TV+ streaming offering.  Shares of Apple rose 2% in after-hours trade.  Apple forecasted revenue for the quarter ending in March above Wall Street expectations.  Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters the company used a wider-than-normal prediction range because of the uncertainty created by the coronavirus.  \u201cWe have limited travel to business-critical situations as of last week,\u201d he said. \u201cThe situation is emerging, and we\u2019re still gathering lots of data points and monitoring it very closely.\u201d  Apple has suppliers in the Wuhan area, the heart of the outbreak, but has alternatives, Cook said. Factories outside Wuhan area will not reopen after the Lunar New Year holiday until Feb. 10, Cook said, but Apple built the delayed restart into its wider revenue forecast.  Apple has shut one store in China, he said, and reduced hours at others because of lower foot traffic, Cook said. Third-party stores that sell Apple products are also facing some closures, Cook said.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Apple is \u201cforecasting a stronger Q2 than analysts predicted, but the fact that the coronavirus is spreading in unpredictable ways in China, where Apple has most of its hardware built, could upset this optimistic forecast,\u201d said eMarketer principal analyst Yoram Wurmser.  SERVICES MISS BUT GROWING  The number of active iPhones, computers and other devices owned by customers, called Apple\u2019s installed base, grew by 100 million to more than 1.5 billion over the past year. Apple executives set a new target of 600 million paid subscribers for music, TV, gaming and other services by the end of calendar 2020.  Apple\u2019s share price has more than doubled since Cook warned a year ago that the company was likely to miss financial targets for its biggest sales quarter of its fiscal 2019. In the year since, Apple slashed prices in China, one of its most important markets, to rekindle sales there.  Apple posted $91.8 billion in revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 28, compared with analyst estimates of $88.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Apple reported earnings per share of $4.99, compared with analyst estimates of $4.55 per share.  The company forecast $63.0 billion to $67.0 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in March, ahead of estimates of $62.4 billion, showing it believes that its phones and other devices such as AirPods wireless headphones will continue to sell well during what is often a slow time of year.  Apple has made a push into paid services, rolling out a credit card with Goldman Sachs and subscription gaming and television services last year. Services revenue was $12.7 billion, below analyst estimates of $13 billion, and up from $10.9 billion the year before.  \u201cServices are important, but the trajectory is heading on target. I feel they\u2019ve made good progress on that front,\u201d said Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The shift toward services, however, depends on Apple continuing to grow its base of users and sign them up for recurring subscriptions that analysts view as potentially more lucrative than hardware sales. Apple said it now has more than 1.5 billion active installed devices and 480 million subscribers to both its own and third-party paid services, compared with 1.4 billion devices and 360 million subscribers a year earlier.  Cook said the company\u2019s Apple TV+ subscription streaming video service released last fall was a \u201crousing success\u201d and that it is \u201cvery strong, both the people that are getting it in the bundle and the people that are paying for it that haven\u2019t bought a new device.\u201d  IPhone sales of $55.96 billion beat analyst estimates of $51.6 billion and year-before sales of $52 billion, snapping a yearlong trend of major sales declines for Apple\u2019s biggest-selling hardware product. Cook said that the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models drove the growth and also factored into the company\u2019s forecast, calling the devices \u201cthe strongest iPhone lineup we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d  But Apple\u2019s wearables segment \u2013 which, along with AirPods, also includes the Apple Watch \u2013 hit $10.0 billion in revenue versus estimates of $9.5 billion, up sharply from $7.3 billion the year before.  Cook told Reuters that Apple could not make enough AirPods and Apple Watch Series 3 devices to meet demand during the fiscal first quarter and continues to be short on both. Cook said Apple does not have an estimate for when it will be able to fulfill demand for AirPods.  \u201cWe\u2019re working on both of those very hard,\u201d Cook told Reuters.","665":"June 8 (Reuters) - Apple Inc has asked its supply chain to manufacture about 20 percent fewer components for iPhones in the latter half of 2018, the Nikkei Asian Review on Friday cited industry sources as saying, sending the iPhone maker\u2019s stock down 2 percent.

A spokesman for Gravis, Germany's biggest reseller of Apple products which is owned by telecoms company Freenet FNTGn.DE, said on Friday that it still had all Apple products on sale, including the iPhone 7 and 8 models.  The German case is Qualcomm\u2019s third major effort to secure a ban on Apple\u2019s lucrative iPhones over patent infringement allegations after similar moves in the United States and China, and is part of a global patent spat between the two companies.  Qualcomm posted bonds of 1.34 billion euros ($1.5 billion) on Thursday, as required for the German court order to come into effect. The court found on Dec. 20 that Apple had infringed Qualcomm patents on power-saving technology used in smartphones.  Apple said in a statement after the verdict last month that it would pull iPhone 7 and 8 models from its own 15 retail stores in Germany during an appeal process once the order came into force. However, it also said it would continue to offer all of its phones at thousands of retail and carrier locations across Germany, a direct contradiction to Qualcomm\u2019s interpretation of the order.  A spokeswoman for the Munich regional court told Reuters on Friday that Apple had appealed the court\u2019s Dec. 20 ruling.  Apple, which had also said it planned to appeal the court decision, declined to comment on Qualcomm\u2019s most recent move on Friday, only referring to its statement after the verdict.  According to the court order, Apple has to stop the sale, offer for sale and importation for sale of all infringing iPhones in Germany.  The court also ordered Apple to recall the affected iPhones from third-party resellers in Germany, according to a statement by Qualcomm.  Kai Ruting, a German lawyer not involved in the case, said the court order was directed at Apple entities rather than third parties.  \u201cThese third parties are still free to sell the (affected) iPhones, and they sell the majority of iPhones,\u201d Ruting said, adding, \u201cthe question of a settlement will be driven by the U.S. litigation and not the German case.\u201d  Ruting said that Apple had strong arguments for the German court\u2019s ruling to be reversed on appeal. If that happens, Qualcomm\u2019s bond will be used to compensate Apple, he said.  Apple\u2019s announced intention to pull iPhones from stores in Germany contrasts with how it has handled a court decision in China, where there was a much broader ban on iPhone sales after a court ruled the devices violated Qualcomm\u2019s patents. Apple has continued to sell phones in China, saying it believed its phones were legal in the country.  Still, Apple also pushed a software update to address concerns over whether it was in compliance with Chinese courts.  Qualcomm has said those software updates were insufficient and that Apple must still withdraw its phones. Apple had filed a request for the Chinese court to reconsider its decision, but no outcome has been announced.

Apple Korea has been under investigation by the Korea Fair Trade Commission over allegations it abused its dominant position by forcing mobile carriers to pay for advertising and warranty repairs, the commission has said.  Apple has agreed to fix \u201cunfair\u201d terms with mobile carriers as part of its proposal, the KFTC said in a briefing. For example, Apple will discuss how to share advertising costs with telecoms firms, which will help reduce burdens to carriers, the KFTC said.  Apple Korea was not immediately available for comment.  Out of the 100 billion won, Apple pledged to offer 40 billion won to build a centre to support research and development for Korea\u2019s small manufacturers and 25 billion won to establish an \u201cacademy\u201d to provide education to developers. Another 25 billion won will be used to give consumer discounts on warranty repair costs and other benefits.

Apple executives have never publicly spoken about the company\u2019s self-driving car program, but filings in a criminal court case last month confirmed that the company had at least 5,000 employees working on the project and that it was working on circuit boards and a \u201cproprietary chip\u201d related to self-driving cars.  Apple is entering a crowded field where rivals such as Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Waymo unit and traditional carmakers such as General Motors Co's GM.N Cruise Automation, as well as startups such as Silicon Valley's Zoox, are pouring billions of dollars into cars that can drive themselves.  On Aug. 24, one of Apple\u2019s Lexus RX 450h self-driving test vehicles in \u201cautonomous mode\u201d was merging south on the Lawrence Expressway in Sunnyvale, California at less than 1 mile per hour when it was rear-ended by a 2016 Nissan Leaf going about 15 miles per hour, according to the report posted on the California Department of Motor Vehicles website.  The accident happened at about 3 p.m. as the Apple vehicle had slowed and was waiting for a safe gap in traffic to complete the merge, the report said.  Both vehicles sustained damage but there were no injuries, the report said. Under a safety plan filed with California regulators, a human driver must be able to take control of Apple\u2019s self-driving test cars.  An Apple spokesman confirmed that the company had filed the report but did not comment further. He declined to respond to questions about whether the trailing car could have been at fault.  Apple\u2019s efforts remained shrouded in secrecy until years after its rivals like Google had begun testing on public roads. The iPhone maker\u2019s first public acknowledgement of interest in the field came in a letter to U.S. transportation regulators in late 2016 urging them not to restrict testing of the vehicles.  Last year, Apple secured a permit to test autonomous vehicles in California. It has been testing cars on the road since last year and now has permits for more than 60 vehicles. Apple researchers also last year published their first public research on cars, a software system that could help spot pedestrians more readily.  The safety of self-driving cars has become a source of concern for U.S. transportation regulators this year after one of Uber Technologies Inc\u2019s [UBER.UL] vehicles struck and killed a woman in March in Arizona, prompting the company to shut down its testing efforts for a time. Uber has said it plans to have self-driving cars back on the road by the end of the year.  The California DMV said it has received it has received 95 autonomous vehicle collision reports as of Aug. 31. Dozens of companies have received permits to test self-driving vehicles on California roads, but those permits require the presence of a human safety driver.","671":"MOSCOW\/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple has prevented the Telegram messaging service from updating globally ever since Russia banned the service and ordered Apple to remove it from its online store, Telegram\u2019s chief executive and founder claimed on Thursday.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Pavel Durov said on his Twitter and Telegram accounts that while the application was available from Apple, Telegram has not been able to deliver technical updates to installed versions of the product anywhere.  He wrote that without updates, Telegram would not work properly with the latest version of the iPhone operating system and it was out of compliance with the new European data privacy law. While Russia makes up 7 percent of Telegram\u2019s users, updates for all Telegram users were being restricted, Durov said.  Apple declined repeated requests for comment.  Apple\u2019s control over the apps in its store enables it to inspect and approve or disapprove of every new version, including updates that fix minor technical issues. If it does not approve an updated version of the software, it cannot be distributed through the App Store.  \u201cRussia banned Telegram on its territory in April because we refused to provide decryption keys for all our users\u2019 communications to Russia\u2019s security agencies. We believe we did the only possible thing, preserving the right of our users to privacy in a troubled country,\u201d Durov, a pioneer of Russian social media, said on his official Telegram Channel.  \u201cAs a result, we\u2019ve also been unable to fully comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for our EU-users by the deadline of May 25, 2018. We are continuing our efforts to resolve the situation,\u201d he said.  After Russia\u2019s decision to block the popular messaging service, two protest rallies were staged in Moscow against what demonstrators called internet censorship. Telegram is challenging the block in Russian courts.  Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB) has said it needed to guard against security threats.  \u201cApp updates are essential to bolster the security of users and their data, and to comply with privacy laws and regulation,\u201d said Peter Micek, general counsel of non-profit digital rights group Access Now.  \u201cThe burden falls squarely on Apple to justify blocking global updates to Telegram, a hugely popular messaging app,\u201d Micek said.  Apple is known globally as a protector of user rights. It famously fought the Federal Bureau of Investigation in court rather than agree to break into a phone that had been used by a slain man who killed people in San Bernardino, Calif.  Governments have stepped up pressure on technology companies to more actively police content in more forms, including apps.  In China, Apple recently banned Virtual Private Network apps and removed the New York Times from its digital marketplace.  Apple has said publicly that it would notify developers when apps were removed at a government\u2019s request, that it would limit takedowns to specific countries when possible, and that beginning in the second half of this year it would note in periodic transparency reports the number of requests for app removals.  Since updates are critical but not covered by Apple\u2019s policy, \u201cThis is more reason for Apple to regularly, publicly report on its own content decisions and responses to government requests, as well as the policies those calls are based on,\u201d said Access Now\u2019s Micek.","672":"A trader is reflected in a computer screen displaying the Spotify brand before the company begins selling as a direct listing on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, U.S., April 3, 2018.

Apple said the bundle was aimed at existing users of its services and its customers can avail alternatives for each of the company\u2019s services.  Spotify and Apple charge $10 a month for their streaming music service, but the Apple One package, which starts at $15 per month, bundles it with other services such as television or video games.  \u201cWhat Apple is attempting to do is sort of form an ecosystem, like what Amazon Prime has done, where they become a one stop shop, and certainly because of that competitors like Spotify do face some risk,\u201d said Aadil Zaman, partner at Wall Street Alliance Group.  Spotify already has bundled offerings with Walt Disney Co\u2019s Hulu and ViacomCBS Inc\u2019s television network Showtime.  \u201cYou have to assume that we\u2019ve expected all of those things,\u201d Spotify Chief Financial Officer Paul Vogel said at a Goldman Sachs conference on Wednesday.  Spotify\u2019s shares were last down 3.5% at $229.61.","673":"LONDON (Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O is talking to major cobalt producers to secure supplies of the material vital for the lithium-ion rechargeable batteries that power its mobile phones, three cobalt industry sources said.  FILE PHOTO: Boxes of iPhone X are pictured during its launch at the Apple store in Singapore, November 3, 2017. REUTERS\/Edgar Su\/File Photo  Apple declined to comment.  Locking in cobalt supplies has become a dominant theme as it is also used in batteries to power electric vehicles whose rapid growth is revolutionizing the motor industry, which is also looking to agree long-term supply deals.  Auto makers, mobile device makers and manufacturers of super-alloys used to make jet engines are all getting jittery about possible scarcities of responsibly sourced cobalt, sources said.  \u201cWe\u2019re not sure whether (Apple) want to buy the cobalt for the battery makers that supply them or whether they are planning to stand behind the cobalt supply chain as guarantors,\u201d a cobalt industry source said.  \u201cThey\u2019ve been asking producers to make offers. We\u2019re not sure of the volumes, but if they are looking for anything more than a couple of years, they might be disappointed.\u201d  A Bloomberg report, citing an anonymous source, said the iPhone maker was seeking contracts to buy several thousand metric tonnes of cobalt for five years or longer.  Industry sources said Apple had spoken to miners such as Glencore GLEN.L, a top producer, which said late last year it would produce around 39,000 tonnes of cobalt this year.  Asked on a results call with reporters on Wednesday about the company\u2019s relationship with Apple, Glencore\u2019s Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg said: \u201cWe have not signed any deals,\u201d adding that Glencore would not sign any long-term deals because the company did not want to lock in cobalt prices.  Talking to reporters in London last December, Glasenberg said the company had held talks with Apple, Tesla TSLA.O and Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE as part of ongoing discussions with industrial clients.  Sources told Reuters last year that Germany\u2019s Volkswagen had asked producers to submit proposals on supplying cobalt for up to 10 years from 2019.  Cobalt CBD0 prices on the London Metal Exchange, at around $80,000 a tonne, have climbed from near $20,000 in January 2016.  Global demand this year is estimated at more than 110,000 tonnes, of which more than 65 percent is expected to come from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it is a byproduct of copper production.  Rights group Amnesty International said last year about a fifth of Congo\u2019s cobalt production is mined by hand by informal miners including children, often in dangerous conditions.  \u201cResponsible sourcing has become the be all and end all, especially in the DRC and especially after the Amnesty report,\u201d a cobalt trading source said.  The DRC is the richest source of cobalt but smaller deposits are also found in countries ranging from Finland to Canada.","674":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O has asked suppliers to increase production of its iPhone 11 models by up to 8 million units, or about 10%, Nikkei Asian Review reported, hinting that demand for the recently launched versions of its flagship phone was picking up.

The company\u2019s shares rose 1.8% to $224.78 in early trading.  The recent surge in iPhone orders is concentrated in the cheapest iPhone 11 model and the iPhone 11 Pro model, sources cited by Nikkei said, while Apple has slightly reduced orders for its top range model, the iPhone 11 Pro Max, which has a starting price of $1,099.  \u201cDespite all the perceived black clouds from being the poster child of the current U.S.-China trade tensions, Apple is seeing a very strong iPhone 11 demand trajectory and defying many skeptics that have been yelling fire in a crowded theater over the past few months,\u201d Wedbush analysts wrote in a note.  The latest iPhone 11 range hit stores in China in September, with short queues of die-hard fans contrasting with the hundreds who camped out ahead of some previous launches, Reuters had reported.  However, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told German daily Bild earlier this week that iPhone sales were off to \u201ca very strong start\u201d.  J.P. Morgan analysts have also raised their iPhone shipment forecast and now expect Apple to sell 1 million units more than their previous estimates.  But concerns remained.  Suppliers remained cautious, the Nikkei reported, adding they were concerned that the higher level of orders would not be sustained.  \u201cDemand is good for now. But we have to be careful not to be too optimistic,\u201d an executive-level source said in the report. \u201cI hope that this year\u2019s peak season lasts longer than last year.\u201d  Apple did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.  Cupertino-based Apple had recently started focusing more on its Services unit, which includes sales from iCloud, the App Store and other businesses, as smartphone sales showed signs of slowing down.  In the company\u2019s latest reported fiscal quarter, iPhones contributed less than half of company revenues for the first time in seven years.  Apple launched its three new iPhone models in September and reduced the starting price of the model upgrade, despite better cameras, to $699, compared to $749 for last year\u2019s iPhone XR.","675":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O said on Tuesday it would release data that could help inform public health authorities on whether people are driving less during lockdown orders to slow the spread of the new coronavirus.  FILE PHOTO: Apple logo is seen on the Macbook in this illustration taken taken April 12, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The data is gathered by counting the number of routing requests from Apple Maps, which is installed on all iPhones, and comparing it with past usage to detect changes in the volume of people driving, walking or taking public transit around the world, Apple said.  The information is being updated daily and compared with a date in mid-January, before most U.S. lockdown measures were in place, Apple said. More than 90% of Americans are under stay-at-home orders and various lockdowns are underway in other countries around the globe.  The data would be aggregated so that requests from individual users would not be shown, and it does not track individual users or their locations, the company said.  The information, available on a public website www.apple.com\/covid19\/mobility , will show changes for major cities and 63 countries or regions, Apple said.  In the San Francisco Bay area, requests for driving directions as of April 12 were down 70% versus Jan. 13, and requests for transit directions plunged 84%, the data showed. In New York City, driving direction requests were down 69% and transit requests were down 89%.  Public health officials in California said April 11 they were using data to track the effectiveness of the state\u2019s lockdown order, although they did not say whether they were using Apple data.  Apple does not provide the absolute number of requests or a specific number of people moving, instead expressing the data as a percentage of requests compared with its mid-January baseline.  Aggregate data helps to protect identity and still identifies individual travel patterns thus avoiding some of the mistakes of countries like South Korea, criticized for privacy violations, said Jason Farley, professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing.  Farley, who is an infectious disease-trained nurse epidemiologist, said the data from the app offers insights into movement right now, yet its impact on maintaining social distancing and making public health decision remains unclear.  Apple's data is more limited than what Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google has made available to public health officials.  Google nearly two weeks ago released data on more than 131 countries, comparing trips in recent weeks to recreational venues, train and bus stations, grocery stores and workplaces with a five-week period earlier this year.  For several countries, Google offers county-level data, which is helpful in countries such as the United States where lockdown orders are issued by county officials.  The Apple data, by contrast, shows only data for some cities, regions and countries and does not show results for entire U.S. states, including those without lockdown orders such as North and South Dakota.  The Apple data also does not capture trips where the user has not asked for directions from the Maps.  Apple said it is continuing to work with public health officials to identify what other data types or trends may be helpful.","676":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Apple Inc said on Wednesday it had started construction of a new campus in Austin, Texas, beside its existing facility where it makes the new MacBook Pro laptops.  Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is set to give a tour of the Texas factory to U.S. President Donald Trump later on Wednesday.  The company has come under fire from Trump because it makes most of its products in China. But Cook and Trump have developed a good relationship. In 2017, Trump said Cook had \u201cpromised me three big plants \u2014 big, big, big.\u201d  The new $1 billion, 3-million-square-foot campus will initially house 5,000 employees, with the capacity to grow to 15,000, and is expected to open in 2022, Apple said.  Austin is one of the fastest-growing U.S. cities, with a population of about 1 million, and is home to the University of Texas and other tech companies, including Dell Technologies Inc in nearby Round Rock, Texas.  Apple currently employs about 7,000 employees in Austin.  The company also continues its expansion in Boulder, Culver City, New York, Pittsburgh, San Diego and Seattle, it said in a statement.  Apple said it is also preparing to ship the new Mac Pro desktop computers to customers, at a production facility just a short distance away from Austin, starting in December.  The new Mac Pro desktop became a political flashpoint earlier this year when the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was moving production to China.","677":"July 30 (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Thursday delivered blowout quarterly results, reporting year-on-year revenue gains across every category and in every geography as consumers working and learning from home during the COVID-19 pandemic turned to its products and services.  The report topped Wall Street expectations, with even some long-overshadowed categories like iPads and Macs getting fresh boosts.  The results, which included iPhone sales some $4 billion above of analyst expectations, came on the same day that U.S. gross domestic product collapsed at a 32.9% annualized rate last quarter, the nation\u2019s worst economic performance since the Great Depression.  Other major tech companies Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc also posted results that topped Wall Street targets, sending their shares up.  With 60% of sales coming from international markets, the Cupertino, California-based company posted iPhone revenues of $26.42 billion, $4 billion above analyst expectations of $22.37 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  In an interview with Reuters, CEO Tim Cook said that after disruptions in April, sales began to pick back up in May and June, helped by what he called a \u201cstrong\u201d launch for the $399 iPhone SE introduced in April.  \u201cI think the economic stimulus that was in place - and I\u2019m not just focused on the U.S., but more broadly - was a help,\u201d Cook told Reuters.  The results underscore that Apple offers devices and services that customers flocked to despite stores re-closing in some U.S. markets. Apple posted rising sales for accessories such as AirPods and services such as the App Store.  The continued growth in services and accessories also showed the durability of the company\u2019s brand, which has prompted investors to view it as a comparative safe haven and pushed up share prices since March.  The company also saw strong sales in its greater China region, where aggressive pricing during a June holiday shopping season and lower-priced iPhone SE model released in April helped boost sales 2% to $9.33 billion from $9.16 billion a year earlier.  Apple also announced a 4-for-1 stock split.  Apple\u2019s fiscal third-quarter revenue and profits were $59.69 billion and $2.58 per share, compared with analyst expectations of $52.25 billion and $2.04 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Sales in its services segment, which also includes offerings such as iCloud and Apple Music, rose 14.8% to $13.16 billion, compared with $11.46 billion a year ago and analyst expectations of $13.18 billion. Cook told Reuters that Apple has 550 million paying subscribers on its platform, up from 515 in the previous quarter.  Sales in the wearables segment that includes the Apple Watch rose 16.7% to $6.45 billion, compared with $5.53 billion a year ago and estimates of $6.0 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  Apple did not give a fiscal fourth-quarter forecast.  Apple\u2019s results come as most analysts expect the release of at least some of its new iPhone models this fall to be delayed after several major Apple suppliers such Broadcom Inc and Qualcomm Inc have given forecasts that included a delayed fall launch from a major customer. Apple is likely to delay the release of some models until November due to supply chain disruptions from the coronavirus, according to a senior official at a major iPhone supplier with direct knowledge of the matter.  Apple benefited from remote work and learning trends, reporting sales in its iPad and Mac segments of $6.58 billion and $7.08 billion, which beat expectations of $4.88 billion and $6.06 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  \u201cBoth had some really significant product announcements at the end of March, beginning of April. I think we have the strongest product line in both areas that we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Cook told Reuters. \u201cYou combine that with the work from home and remote learning, and it\u2019s yielded really, really strong results.\u201d  But the global smartphone market was already stagnating before the novel coronavirus caused it to contract, and Apple has leaned heavily into growing its services business, which is where the company\u2019s fastest revenue growth occurred during the fiscal third quarter. The biggest component of that business is the App Store, where Apple generates commissions between 15% and 30% on some sales.  On Wednesday, Cook faced questions from U.S. lawmakers about Apple\u2019s practices related to the store, which have come under fire from independent app developers who say its rules and unpredictable approval process put them at a disadvantage against the iPhone maker.","678":"(Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply higher on Monday, fueled by expectations of a coronavirus relief package and by a rally in Amazon, Apple and other technology stocks ahead quarterly earnings season.

(Reporting by Tomo Uetake; Editing by Arun Koyyur)","680":"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Smartphone retailers in China say it\u2019s a tough sell of late with consumers reluctant to upgrade, put off by chill economic winds.  Even so domestic brands led by Huawei have made big strides, wooing consumers with top-notch hardware and innovative features as they move upmarket in the $500-$800 price range. The result: a loss of share in a key segment for Apple Inc and fresh price cuts for iPhones by Chinese retailers.  \u201cOf those people who are upgrading, there are many switching from Apple to Chinese brands but very few switching from Chinese brands to Apple,\u201d said Jiang Ning, who manages a Xiaomi store in the northern province of Shandong.  Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, Xiaomi Corp, Oppo and Vivo once sought to grab share in the world\u2019s biggest smartphone market with value-for-money devices, but consumer demand for better phones has prompted strategic rethinks.  \u201cPeople are more attached to their phone than ever and have higher expectations for the function and experience it offers. The response has been constant upgrading of hardware specs,\u201d Alen Wu, global vice president at Oppo, told Reuters.  He Fan, CEO of Huishoubao which buys and resells used phones, said he has seen a consumer shift to Huawei from Apple, driven by the Chinese love of selfies and emphasis on camera quality. Huawei has had a tie-up with German camera maker Leica since 2016.  \u201cHuawei\u2019s cameras have become noticeably better than Apple\u2019s in that they suit the tastes of Chinese consumers more,\u201d he said.  Compared to dual-cameras common in most smartphones, Huawei\u2019s P20 Pro device boasts three rear-facing cameras, with the additional one improving zoom capabilities.  It is one of several new devices in its P20 and Mate 20 lines, which helped Huawei\u2019s share of the $500-$800 segment in China surge to 26.6 percent last year from 8.8 percent, data from research firm Counterpoint shows.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  Apple, by contrast, saw its share of the segment tumble to 54.6 percent from 81.2 percent, also hurt by its decision to move even further upmarket with the iPhone X series.  \u201cMost Chinese smartphone buyers are not ready to shell out beyond $1,000 for a phone,\u201d said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint. \u201cThis left a gap in the below-$800 segment, which Chinese vendors grabbed with both hands.\u201d  (For a graphic on 'Chinese smartphones increase share of home market' click tmsnrt.rs\/2HvsyQi)  Shipments of phones priced above $600 in China grew 10 percent in 2018, data from research firm Canalys shows. By contrast, the overall market shrunk 14 percent, marking a second year of contraction.  OVERSEAS GAINS  The weaker cachet for Apple in China was underscored this month when several major retailers simultaneously cut iPhone prices for a second time this year.  A 64GB iPhone 8 sold at Suning.com Co Ltd now costs 3,899 yuan ($580), roughly 25 percent less than it did in December. That\u2019s also lower than its $599 price tag in the United States, where iPhones typically cost less to buy than in China. Most iPhone models through to the iPhone 8 series have seen prices in China cut, albeit not equally.  In earnings too, it seems to be a tale of divergent fortunes. Apple\u2019s October-December revenue from the Greater China region fell by about a quarter from a year earlier. Greater China currently accounts for 15.6 percent of its overall revenue.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  Huawei, the world\u2019s No. 2 smartphone maker, has estimated revenue for 2018 rose 21 percent, which analysts attribute in large part to robust smartphone sales.  More broadly, fewer sales for Apple means fewer customers for its App Store and media streaming services. The shift to higher-end phones by Chinese brands has also meant greater inroads in overseas markets.  Huawei\u2019s shipments in Europe jumped 55 percent in the latest quarter and it now has 23.6 percent market share, according to Canalys. That\u2019s not far behind Samsung Electronics and Apple which saw small declines in shipments.  OPPO, VIVO  If Huawei is taking the lion\u2019s share of turf that Apple once had in China, Oppo and Vivo - brands owned by electronics hardware conglomerate BBK - are the newest threats.  In June, Vivo launched the Nex which starts from 3,898 yuan ($610) and in July, Oppo launched the Find X, priced at 4,999 yuan ($755).  The models mark the first time the brands have priced a phone above $600, a sharp departure from their roots selling $300-$500 models to young consumers in second-tier cities.  The devices came with features unavailable in the iPhone, including under-the-glass fingerprint sensors and \u201cnotchless\u201d displays, both of which increase the size of usable screen.  Xiaomi too is going upmarket, announcing in January it would split off its low-budget Redmi range of phones into a sub-brand. In doing so, it is taking a leaf out of Huawei\u2019s book which has for years sold cheaper devices under the Honor brand, helping differentiate its products.  Redmi will target international markets and e-commerce sales, while the flagship Xiaomi brand will target China and offline retail markets, company founder Lei Jun told reporters.  Last month, Xiaomi unveiled the Mi 9, its latest flagship device with a price tag of 2,999 yuan ($450). But the company also said it might be the last time a Xiaomi flagship phone would be priced under 3,000 yuan.  \u201cXiaomi\u2019s flagship series phones were once always set at 1,999 yuan,\u201d said Lei. \u201cThis was a contributing factor to our rise, but it also became an obstacle to our growth,\u201d he said.

Without Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix NFLX.O and Alphabet - the so-called FAANG stocks - the S&P 500 would be down about 4% in 2020, compared with the index's 2% year-to-date rise, according to a research note from Bespoke Investment Group on Thursday.  \u201cDue to both the huge weight of these stocks and their outperformance, the market has become more reliant on them than ever before for its gains,\u201d according to Bespoke.","684":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O and Salesforce.com Inc CRM.N are entering a partnership in which the iPhone maker will help Salesforce build the iPhone maker's features such as its Siri voice assistant deeper into Salesforce's own mobile apps, which are widely used in the sales and marketing industries.  In exchange, Salesforce will make software tools so that the big businesses that use its back-end technology to power their own apps can build better products with features specific to iPhones and iPads.  Apple and Salesforce both have huge ecosystems of third-party software developers. About 20 million developers make software for Apple devices, most of them focused on the consumer, while Salesforce has about 5 million developers who tap into its back-end systems to build business applications - a market that Apple has been expanding into through deals with International Business Machines IBM.N, Cisco Systems CSCO.O and Accenture ACN.N.  The partnership means that a salesperson can use Siri after a customer meeting to update that customer\u2019s record with notes from the meeting, flag a customer service issue for a support team to follow-up on and many other data-entry tasks that can eat up valuable time.  \u201cIf you look at enterprise in general, voice has not been used as much as in consumer,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told Reuters in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be able to provide the sales rep instant access to things using your voice instead of clicks and going through different apps. We\u2019re changing the way people work, and that\u2019s always been at the heart of what Apple is about - changing things for the better.\u201d  In exchange, Salesforce is building tools so companies that tap into its back-end systems can make better use of Apple-specific features like Siri.  At Salesforce\u2019s annual customer conference this week, Marriott International will demonstrate a new system that uses Salesforce and Apple tools so that hotel guests can turn up the heat, order a sandwich or hail a ride using Siri with an Apple HomePod in their hotel room. And at the next Marriot the guest stays at, Siri will remember the guest\u2019s preferences - even their favorite sandwich, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff told Reuters in an interview.  \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met with a single customer in the world that doesn\u2019t want me to help them do more with Tim\u2019s products,\u201d Benioff said Cook and Apple in the interview.  Salesforce also runs an educational platform called Trailhead, where it says one in four people who take courses in how to build business apps with Salesforce\u2019s tools ends up getting a raise or promotion. As part of the deal, Apple and Salesforce will add courses on how to develop iPhone and iPad applications.  \u201cThese people are learning the tech skills that are elevating their careers,\u201d Benioff said.","685":"FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc. logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, New York, U.S., October 16, 2019.

The mat was intended to wirelessly charge up to three Apple products at once, such as an iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods wireless headphones.  While wireless charging has spread through the gadget industry, charging three devices at once with higher wattage \u201cfast charging\u201d has proved challenging. Furniture seller Ikea, for example, sells a $60 matt that can handle three phones but it only features slower 5-watt charging.  In a statement, Apple said that it had concluded that its AirPower mat \u201cwill not achieve our high standards.\u201d  \u201cWe apologize to those customers who were looking forward to this launch,\u201d Dan Riccio, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering, said in the statement. \u201cWe continue to believe that the future is wireless and are committed to push the wireless experience forward.\u201d  The announcement was a rare move for Apple, known in the electronics industry for keeping tight wraps on product plans until it publicly launches them at splashy events in Silicon Valley. The early announcement of AirPower, along with a wirelessly charged version of its AirPods headphones, was a break in that tradition. Apple released the updated AirPods last week, heightening speculation that the accompanying charging mat would come soon.  Daring Fireball, a website that covers Apple news, previously reported that Apple engineers had issues with devices overheating on the AirPower pad. Apple declined to comment beyond its statement on the project.  Apple offered wireless charging in the iPhone in 2017, after many of its rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd had offered the feature for several years. While rumors circulated that Apple might create its own unique wireless charging technology, the company instead chose to use a system that works with Qi, an open industry standard already in use by Samsung and others.  Apple shares did not move on the news, and shares of NXP Semiconductors and STMicroelectronics, two major suppliers of chips used in Qi systems, appeared to be unaffected also.","687":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks fell on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 notching a fifth straight day of losses as financial stocks were hit by fears that regulations on the banking industry would tighten once the Democratic Party takes control of the U.S. House of Representatives.

REUTERS\/Toru Hanai  TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Sharp Corp 6753.T, an Apple AAPL.O supplier, posted a profit that beat expectations and was its first rise in five quarters, driven by the strength in the laptop business it bought from Toshiba 6502.T.  Sharp, which makes sensors, camera modules and screens for Apple\u2019s iPhones, posted an operating profit of 22.3 billion yen ($206.54 million) for the second quarter ended September, up from 22.2 billion yen a year prior.  That compared with a 19.65 billion yen average of 4 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.  Sharp, a unit of Taiwan's Foxconn 2317.TW, maintained its profit forecast for the year ending March at 100 billion yen, versus a consensus estimate of 82.23 billion yen from 10 analysts.  Sharp took over Toshiba\u2019s loss-making laptop unit last year and turned it around, making it a major profit contributor, in a push to regain global presence.  The outlook for Sharp\u2019s electronic devices business is also improving as sales at its key customer Apple appear to be stabilizing.  While iPhone sales fell 9% in the three months ended September, it was smaller than the drop in recent quarters and better than analyst expectations.  Sharp, which Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, acquired control of in 2016, is aiming to expand globally by launching high-definition 8K television sets and return to the U.S. TV market.  The Osaka-based firm cut back its overseas TV business and licensed China\u2019s Hisense to use its brand in the Americas in 2015, when massive losses at its core display panel unit put its survival at risk. But earlier this year, Sharp said it had effectively regained the license sold to Hisense.","691":"Jan 3 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc said on Thursday that it has posted security bonds of 1.34 billion euros ($1.52 billion) in order to be able to enforce a German court order, which found that Apple had infringed the chipmakers patents on power saving technology used in smartphones.

A woman uses her mobile phone, an iPhone 6 by Apple in Munich downtown, Germany, January 27, 2016. REUTERS\/Michaela Rehle  The nine justices heard an hour of arguments in an appeal by the Cupertino, California-based technology company of a lower court\u2019s decision to revive the proposed class-action lawsuit filed in federal court in California in 2011 by a group of iPhone users seeking monetary damages.  The lawsuit said Apple violated federal antitrust laws by requiring apps to be sold through the company\u2019s App Store and then taking a 30 percent commission from the purchases.  The case may hinge on how the justices apply one of the court\u2019s past decisions to the claims against Apple. That 1977 precedent limited damages for anti-competitive conduct to those directly overcharged rather than indirect victims who paid an overcharge passed on by others.  Apple was backed by Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Some liberal and conservative justices sharply questioned an attorney for Apple and U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco, who argued on behalf of the administration on the company\u2019s side, over their argument that the consumers were not directly affected by purchasing the apps from Apple.  Liberal Justice Elena Kagan, explaining how an App Store purchase is handled, said, \u201cFrom my perspective, I\u2019ve just engaged in a one-step transaction with Apple.\u201d  Some conservative justices, including Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch, wondered whether the 1977 ruling was still valid in a modern marketplace.  Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 questions suggested he agreed with Apple\u2019s position. Roberts expressed concern that, for a single price increase, Apple could be held liable by both consumers and App developers.  The iPhone users, including lead plaintiff Robert Pepper of Chicago, have argued that Apple\u2019s monopoly leads to inflated prices compared to if apps were available from other sources.  Though developers set the prices of their apps, Apple collects the payments from iPhone users, keeping the 30 percent commission on each purchase. One area of dispute in the case is whether app developers recoup the cost of that commission by passing it on to consumers. Developers earned more than $26 billion in 2017, a 30 percent increase over 2016, according to Apple.  Apple spokeswoman Rachel Wolf Tulley said in a statement after the arguments that the App Store has fueled competition and promoted innovation in software development, leading to millions of jobs in the sector.  \u201cWe are hopeful the Supreme Court will recognize Apple\u2019s critical role as a marketplace for apps, and uphold existing legal precedent by finding in favor of Apple and the millions of developers who sell their apps on our platform,\u201d Tulley said.  CLOSING COURTHOUSE DOORS  Apple, also backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business group, has argued that a ruling siding with the iPhone users who filed the lawsuit would threaten the burgeoning field of e-commerce, which generates hundreds of billions of dollars annually in U.S. retail sales.  The plaintiffs, as well as antitrust watchdog groups, said closing courthouse doors to those who buy end products would undermine antitrust enforcement and allow monopolistic behavior to expand unchecked. The plaintiffs were backed by 30 state attorneys general, including from Texas, California and New York.  The plaintiffs said app developers would be unlikely to sue Apple, which controls the service where they make money, leaving no one to challenge anti-competitive conduct.  Along with Gorsuch, conservative Justice Samuel Alito raised the reluctance of app developers to sue Apple in questioning the 1977 precedent.  Justice Brett Kavanaugh, another conservative Trump appointee, pushed back against Francisco\u2019s contention that Apple\u2019s actions are not the direct cause of higher prices for consumers, because app makers set the final prices. Kavanaugh pointed out that \u201cconsumers are harmed then, too.\u201d  Kavanaugh later suggested that the plaintiffs would have a more clear-cut right to sue if Apple bought the apps from the developers and sold them to consumers with its 30 percent commission.  Apple has said it is acting only as the agent for app developers who sell the apps to consumers through the App Store.  Liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer seemed certain that the iPhone buyers\u2019 claims should go forward.  \u201cThey\u2019re claiming their injury is a suppression of a cheaper price,\u201d Sotomayor told Apple\u2019s attorney, Daniel Wall.  The company sought to have the antitrust claims dismissed, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked the required legal standing to bring the lawsuit. A federal judge in Oakland threw out the suit, saying the consumers were not direct purchasers because the higher fees they paid were passed on to them by the developers.  The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived the case last year, finding that Apple was a distributor that sold iPhone apps directly to consumers.","693":"MUMBAI\/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - In India, the world's second-biggest smartphone market, Apple Inc's AAPL.O normally deft management of government relations is being put to a fresh high-stakes test.  FILE PHOTO: Apple iPhone X mobile phones are seen at an Apple reseller store in Mumbai, India July 27, 2018. REUTERS\/Francis Mascarenhas  For almost two years, Apple has battled India\u2019s telecom regulator over a demand that it allow the use of the government\u2019s anti-spam app. Non-compliance, the watchdog threatened last month, could result in phones being \u201cderecognized\u201d from the country\u2019s networks, meaning they would no longer function.  It is just one of several headaches the Cupertino, California-based company is nursing in India - a market it calls a top priority but where it has just 1 percent share.  Apple has not gotten the tax breaks it has sought for suppliers to expand local manufacturing - key if it is to avoid steep import duties that have made its iPhones, already pricey for many Indian consumers, even more expensive.  Local content prerequisites have also stopped the U.S. tech giant from opening its own stores. The lack of direct sales channels has helped make it vulnerable to discounting and prompted it to recently embark on a major overhaul of its retail strategy.  At the heart of its latest tussle with the government is India\u2019s pervasive problem with spam and nuisance calls - one the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is trying to counter with an app that it wants all phone makers to install.  The app has been available on the Android store since 2016, but Apple in March told Reuters that TRAI\u2019s app \u201cas envisioned violates the privacy policy of the App Store.\u201d  The new version of its iPhone operating system, expected in autumn, will allow many of the app\u2019s functions but not fully automatic spam filtering as that functionality could open the door to Apple users being tracked by third parties, Apple said in a letter to regulators.  TRAI, however, last month notified Indian telecom firms it could give them six months notice to \u201cderecognize\u201d devices from their networks if the devices do not support anti-spam apps that are approved by the government.  In the letter, dated June 18 and responding to a draft of the proposed notification, Apple asked for the clause about derecognition to be dropped.  \u201cWe look forward to working with TRAI to address the issue of unsolicited commercial communications, while simultaneously ensuring that we fully honor our commitment to protect the privacy and security of our users,\u201d Apple\u2019s head of public policy in India, Kulin Sanghvi, wrote in the letter which was seen by Reuters.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The Indian Cellular Association has also come out in opposition to the regulator\u2019s move.  Asked by Reuters to respond to Apple\u2019s request to drop the derecognition threat, TRAI Chairman R.S. Sharma said the notification could not be quashed or challenged by writing a letter.  \u201cThe most appropriate way to challenge this is in court,\u201d he said.  TAXES AND DISCOUNTS  Apple has also failed to find favor with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s administration when it comes to tariffs. Championing policies that force overseas tech firms to manufacture locally, the government has imposed import duties.  A base model iPhoneX is now priced at nearly $1,400 in India - some 40 percent more than in the United States.  Apple, which currently assembles only two low-end iPhones in India, has said tariff-free imports are critical for smartphone component suppliers and essential to make local manufacturing practical.  But its pleas have gone unheeded and its competitors are not making the same arguments.  Samsung Electronics 005930.KS builds all its Indian phones locally and last month opened the world's biggest mobile manufacturing plant on the outskirts of New Delhi - which is slated to become an export hub. A key supplier for China's Xiaomi 1810.HK, another major Apple rival, this week said it would spend $200 million to build a plant in southern India.  The steep tariffs are exacerbating sales woes for Apple in India, where it has to rely on a network of distributors to supply devices. Competition among retailers has led to rampant discounting, at both physical stores and online, and Apple\u2019s policy to keep prices uniform within a single market has collapsed in India.  It has also often meant a desultory buying experience for the consumer.  Aiming to fix that, Apple appointed company veteran, Michel Coulomb, as its new India sales chief late last year and he has cut its national distributors from five to two. At a June meeting with around 20 of Apple\u2019s key distribution channel partners, Coulomb outlined a new program aimed at eliminating discounting and improving the shopping experience, a source familiar with the matter said.  Other sources also said Apple aims to make financing plans that it offers in partnership with banks more attractive.  But Apple is still some time away from opening its flagship stores in the country due to the requirement that direct sales outlets have 30 percent local content, a separate source added.  The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to media. Apple declined to comment on its sales and distribution strategy.  Until Apple successfully tackles its regulatory and sales hurdles, its higher-end iPhones are likely to remain too expensive for many Indian consumers while for its older models, rivals have matched many of Apple\u2019s features at far lower prices.  \u201cThe traditional appeal of the iconic Apple logo is gradually being challenged by the wow factor of a feature-rich, premium Android smartphone with the fastest processor or the best camera,\u201d said Tarun Pathak, an associate director at tech research firm Counterpoint.","694":"TAIPEI, March 12 (Reuters) - Terry Gou, founder of Apple\u2019s major manufacturing partner Foxconn, said on Thursday the resumption of production at its factories in China had \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d after a prolonged halt due to a coronavirus outbreak that had disrupted supply chains.  Foxconn, the world\u2019s largest contract electronics maker, has most of its production in China, where many of its suppliers are also located, and as a consequence was hit hard by the virus-related curbs that have hurt demand and upended supply chains of manufacturers globally.  The Taiwan-based company, which assembles Apple\u2019s iPhones, in February suffered its biggest monthly drop in revenue in about seven years as the outbreak play havoc with its business.  Gou told reporters in Taipei that the return to work at Foxconn factories in China had \u201cexceeded our expectations and imagination\u201d and that supplies to its factories there and in Vietnam had returned to normal.  Gou, however, warned about weak consumer demand as a result of the coronavirus epidemic which the World Health Organization has now declared a pandemic, and said the U.S. market was of particular concern.  \u201cIn the United States, what we are worried about is the market. If production was resumed quickly but consumers stop spending...that would be key to the economic recovery,\u201d he said.  Apple, Foxconn\u2019s top client, rescinded its March quarter sales guidance citing a slower ramp up of manufacturing in China after travel restrictions and an extended Lunar New Year break.  Gou said he has \u201cconcerns\u201d over the electronics supply chain in Japan and South Korea, which are grappling with their own serious outbreaks of the virus, and he cited rising prices for DRAM memory and supply issues with display panels. He did not elaborate.  Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, last week warned revenue would drop 15% in first quarter, but said it would recover thereafter as production returns to normal in virus-hit China.

But if they\u2019re not, if they\u2019re quarantined, that could be bad.\u201d  While Apple uses other contract manufacturers such as Wistron Corp to make some iPhones, Taiwan\u2019s Foxconn tends to handle the introduction of new models because its capabilities are the most advanced, supply chain experts said.  Foxconn, the world\u2019s largest contract electronics maker, delayed reopening key iPhone factories in Shenzhen and Zhengzhou after the Lunar New Year holiday but hopes to resume half of its Chinese production by the end of February.  Senior Foxconn officials who have been working remotely from Taipei since the holiday have not yet returned to China on a large scale, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, speaking of company officials generally.  Apple declined to comment. Foxconn Technology Group said in an emailed statement on Tuesday that the company is following all legally required health and safety practices at its factories to protect employee welfare.  \u201cConsistent with this, we are taking a cautious approach in the implementation of our post-holiday production schedules in each of our facilities in China,\u201d the company said.  Last week, Apple warned investors it was unlikely to meet revenue targets for the first three months of 2020 and that global iPhone supplies would be limited as manufacturing sites in China were not ramping up production as quickly as expected.  Foxconn said this month that the coronavirus outbreak would lower its revenue this year.  Earlier this month, United Airlines, which has disclosed that Apple is a major customer, said it was cancelling all fights to China until late April. Apple, meanwhile, said on Jan. 28 that it was restricting employee to travel to China to \u201cbusiness-critical\u201d situations.  COLLABORATION CRITICAL  For new iPhone models, the transition from prototype to the assembly of millions of units starts in earnest when the Lunar New Year holiday in China ends in late January and early February, people familiar with the process said.  At that point, Apple has tested numerous prototypes and is in the late stages of what is called engineering validation, in which Foxconn workers assemble small numbers of devices while engineers from both firms troubleshoot.  If delays occur at this stage it would eat into the time Apple needs to finalize orders for chips and other parts, almost all of which are custom-made for the iPhone.  Because of the huge volumes needed, \u201cthey can\u2019t wait to make component selections\u201d, said Ron Keith, founder of Supply Chain Resources Group, which works with electronics makers such as Alphabet Inc\u2019s Nest.  In March and April, Apple engineers typically work with Foxconn counterparts to set up new assembly lines and do trial runs, before making final adjustments in April and May. The aim is to have production lines up and running in June so others can be added progressively to ramp up output.  \u201cIt\u2019s very complicated. There are so many variables in the environment, including small factors such as air pollution,\u201d one of the people familiar with the process said.  Anna-Katrina Shedletsky, a former Apple engineer and founder of Instrumental, a startup focused on factory automation based in Mountain View, California, said on-the-ground engineering collaboration was critical for new products.  \u201cYou can fly those engineers somewhere else but there\u2019s knowledge about how you make a product in that environment. It\u2019s not that it can\u2019t be taught but it\u2019s a hard thing to move,\u201d she said.  While supply chain experts and industry insiders say Apple still has time to keep its annual iPhone schedule on track, travel restrictions have left it in a tough spot.  \u201cThere is no face-to-face work being done,\u201d an executive at a semiconductor firm that supplies smartphone companies and works with teams in China said, speaking generally about phone production cycles.  \u201cAnd the word is, that\u2019s probably not going to change for another month at best. You\u2019re really talking about two lost months, which in the consumer electronics cycle is huge.\u201d","699":"(For a live blog on European stocks, type LIVE\/ in an Eikon news window)  LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Apple\u2019s first revenue warning in nearly 12 years sent European shares sliding on Thursday with the tech sector particularly badly bruised as chipmakers which supply to the iPhone maker fell sharply.

FILE PHOTO: Men wearing protective face masks walk past broken windows of a facility run by Wistron Corp, a Taiwanese contract manufacturer for Apple, in Narsapura near the southern city of Bengaluru, India, December 14, 2020. REUTERS\/Stringer\/File Photo  Thousands of contract workers angry over the alleged non-payment of wages, destroyed equipment and vehicles at a Wistron plant in southern India on Saturday, causing an estimated $60 million in damages.  The Taiwanese company, one of Apple\u2019s top suppliers, had been hiring in significant numbers at the plant that became operational earlier this year.  It assembled the second-generation iPhone SE there and was expected to start producing newer models, but the violence has led the company to shut the site and file a police complaint against more than 5,000 contract workers for destruction of property.  Wistron has not disclosed details, but one source familiar with the situation, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the area where smartphones are assembled and lines where delicate components, such as printed circuit boards, are mounted, have been damaged.  The company did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters. It said in a regulatory filing in Taiwan that it was doing its best to get the plant running again.  Apple also did not respond to a request for comment.  Two sources close to the situation, who asked not to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the press, said restarting could be difficult.  \u201cIt disrupts business for Wistron massively,\u201d one of the sources said.  \u201cThe company was looking to hire between 15,000 to 20,000 workers over the next one year, had plans to assemble another iPhone device but the company could take several weeks, or even months to get back on its feet again.\u201d  Wistron committed earlier this year to invest roughly 13 billion rupees ($176.74 million) for smartphone manufacturing over the next five years to qualify for the government\u2019s production-linked incentive plan.  Three sources familiar with the matter said Wistron could lose most of this year\u2019s incentives if operations stay suspended, although they did not give figures.  An Apple investigation into whether Wistron flouted supplier guidelines and a labour department enquiry into the alleged non-payment of wages could add to its problems in India.  \u2018MAKE IN INDIA\u2019 CAMPAIGN  Wistron\u2019s issues are also a setback to Apple, which has in turn committed to expanding manufacturing in India and lobbied for incentives.  Apple has used India as a base to widen assembly beyond China as it adapts to a trade war between Beijing and Washington.  In India, it uses Foxconn\u2019s unit in southern Tamil Nadu state as well as Wistron\u2019s factory to make smartphones for the domestic market and for export.  Industry executives and tech analysts said Apple may seek to deepen ties with other contract manufacturers in India.  Pegatron Corp, another of Apple\u2019s Taiwan-based global suppliers, is expected to begin India operations soon.  Apart from any inconvenience to the companies, the fall-out from Saturday\u2019s violence in the southern Indian hub for automobile and electronics production, is a blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Make In India campaign to lure international manufacturers.  Officials are already working to limit the damage.  The technology ministry said in a statement the Wistron plant was an aberration.  Officials from New Delhi and the government of Karnataka state, where the plant is located, said they have assured Wistron of their support.

REUTERS\/Fabrizio Bensch  (Reuters) - Fitbit Inc launched its cheapest smartwatch on Wednesday to defend its position as the second-largest seller of smartwatches after Apple Inc.  San Francisco-based Fitbit said the Versa Lite smartwatch will cost $160, down from $200 for the full version. While still tracking workouts and heart rate, it will lack some features such as the ability to store music directly on the watch.  In 2018, Fitbit sold 5.5 million smartwatches, behind the biggest seller Apple Inc\u2019s 22.5 million units, but just ahead of Samsung\u2019s 5.3 million units, according to data firm Strategy Analytics.  But Samsung overtook Fitbit on a quarterly basis in the last three months of 2018.  Indeed, rivalry for a greater share of the market has heated up as Apple and Samsung have added features for health tracking, Fitbit\u2019s core focus. The Apple Watch included an electrocardiogram feature last year, and Samsung this year added a blood pressure sensor to its Galaxy Active Watch.  Fitbit also announced new versions of its cheaper trackers in a bid to lure more casual users who might not be ready to fork out for the pricier devices of its rivals: The $100 Fitbit HR, capable of tracking heart rate, and the $70 Ace 2, which tracks activity in children as young as 6 years old.  Apple does not make a cheaper tracker and its watches start at $279, while Samsung\u2019s tracker and watches start at $200.  Fitbit is trying to persuade investors that it can hang on to users and sell them future devices if it gets them onto its tracking platform, which can store and share health and activity data. Chief Executive James Park said at a press event ahead of the product release that the company has nearly 28 million active users.  Last month, Fitbit forecast first-quarter revenue of between $250 million and $268 million. That was lower than analysts\u2019 average sales expectation of $272.3 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.","705":"ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss watch industry faces an increased threat from a new Apple Watch able to detect heart problems that is likely to appeal to older shoppers, industry experts said on Thursday.

Apple has rapidly gained share in the watch market, with connected technology research firm CCS Insight estimating that the tech giant will come close this year to matching worldwide sales of Swiss-made watches, which had shipments of 24 million units in 2017.  Exports of Swiss watches in the entry-price segment -- a retail price of up to around $500 -- have steadily declined over the past years, with competition from smartwatches one of the factors responsible.  Brands in that price range include Swatch Group\u2019s Swatch and Tissot, the Mondaine brand and fashion watches made by U.S. watchmaker Fossil.  \u201cThe Apple Watch continues to improve and provide additional relevant functions. I think this will represent a harder and harder challenge to entry-price Swiss-made watches, which are not in a position to stay relevant,\u201d Exane BNP Paribas analyst Luca Solca said.  The Apple Watch Series 4 is priced from $399.  The head of LVMH\u2019s watch division, which makes watches under the Zenith, Hublot and TAG-Heuer brands, Jean-Claude Biver thought the Apple Watch did not pose a threat to Swiss watches above a certain price point.  People getting into watches thanks to an Apple product were more likely to buy a Swiss timepiece later on, he said in emailed comments.  Shares in Richemont were up 0.2 percent at 1315 GMT, while those of peer Swatch Group, which is more exposed to the entry-price segment, were down 0.6 percent.

Lisa Jackson, Apple\u2019s vice president of environment, policy and social Initiatives, told Reuters the research will inform how Apple designs its products.  \u201cI absolutely think that the learnings we make there will be for all of Apple, and hopefully for all of our sector, and of course will influence designers and engineers as we go forward,\u201d Jackson said in an interview.  Apple has faced criticism in the past that its thin-and-light product designs make it hard to disassemble products so they can be recycled.  Kyle Wiens, chief executive of iFixit, which provides free repair instructions for electronics, said Apple deserves some credit for making the iPhone reasonable to recycle. But he said many other popular products in its lineup - such as its AirPods headphones - cannot be economically recycled because they are stuck together with glue.

FILE PHOTO: A motorcyclist rides past the logo of Foxconn, the trading name of Hon Hai Precision Industry, in Taipei, Taiwan, March 30, 2018. REUTERS\/Tyrone Siu\/File Photo  The comments come as U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to slap further tariffs on $300 billion worth of goods from China - where the bulk of Apple\u2019s devices are assembled. The country is also a key market for the firm.  \u201cTwenty-five percent of our production capacity is outside of China and we have enough capacity to meet Apple\u2019s demand in the U.S. market,\u201d a member of the Taiwanese firm\u2019s proposed new board, Liu Young-way, said on Tuesday. He added that if Apple needs, Foxconn could adjust its production lines accordingly.  Liu was speaking at Foxconn\u2019s first investor conference in Taipei, where the company also said it was well positioned to tackle the \u201cincreasingly tough\u201d trade war situation with its production lines across 16 countries.  The trade war \u201cwill have some impact, but it will be limited,\u201d Liu said.  He also emphasized that Foxconn\u2019s investment in Wisconsin was more important than before given the trade war. The firm is already under the spotlight for having failed so far to meet job-creation targets in the U.S. state.  LEADERSHIP OVERHAUL  Foxconn, formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, also unveiled a leadership overhaul that will see more executives involved in its daily operations, as Chairman Terry Gou seeks to run in Taiwan\u2019s 2020 presidential election.  Reuters exclusively reported last week on the overhaul, which marks a major shift in Foxconn\u2019s corporate leadership that has seen 68-year-old Gou hold a tight grip on the firm\u2019s daily operations and strategic decisions.  Gou told Reuters in April that he planned to step down from Foxconn to pave the way for younger talent to move up the ranks.  Foxconn will now get an \u201coperations committee\u201d, that will give nine senior executives from the group\u2019s subsidiaries greater control. It will meet once every week.  The committee includes most members from Foxconn\u2019s proposed new board, including Foxconn CFO Huang Chiu-lien and Foxconn Interconnect Technology Ltd Chairman Lu Sung-Ching.  The committee did not include Gou or the chairman of Foxconn\u2019s Japanese electronics unit Sharp Corp, Tai Jeng-wu, who are both members of the new proposed board.  Two people with direct knowledge of the matter said Tai had resigned from the committee to avoid possible conflict of interest between parent Foxconn and its Japanese unit.  Foxconn did not provide a reason for Tai\u2019s absence.  WISCONSIN PLANS  Investors are keen for any insight into succession plans at Foxconn and what it means for plans laid out by Gou such as the $10 billion investment to create 13,000 jobs in Wisconsin and an $8.8 billion display factory in southern China.  Liu said the Wisconsin investment, which is expected to reach $1.4-1.5 billion with up to 2,000 employees by end of 2020, was on schedule. He added the project, which includes manufacturing of displays and servers, was poised to go into production by end of next year.

The official declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to media.  \u201cAt this point, it is difficult to say this is trading based on undisclosed information,\u201d the official said.  Some retail investors expressed concern in online stock forums about the possibility of insider trading after a dozen Hyundai mid-ranking executives sold stock in the automaker on the Korea Exchange in recent weeks.  Hyundai\u2019s stock price rose sharply after domestic media reported early in January about possible cooperation between the company and the tech giant on self-driving electric vehicles.  An FSS spokesperson said the regulator was \u201cmonitoring\u201d the situation. The FSS does not officially confirm whether it is conducting probes into share trading.  Hyundai did not have comment on the matter when reached by Reuters. The Korea Exchange said it does not comment on individual company stocks.  On Monday, Hyundai said in a filing it was not now in talks with Apple on autonomous vehicles, just a month after it confirmed early-stage talks with the tech giant. Shares in Hyundai had jumped 21% between the initial confirmation and Monday\u2019s announcement that the talks were off.  Since the initial domestic media report of Hyundai-Apple cooperation on Jan. 8, a total of 12 Hyundai Motor executives traded about 3,400 shares worth about 833 million won ($747,152), according to Reuters calculations based on the company\u2019s regulatory filings.  \u2018PROFIT TAKING\u2019  Analysts said sales by executives of shares in the company they work for was standard practice.  \u201cIt\u2019s a routine procedure that company executives sell or buy their company stocks,\u201d said Kevin Yoo, an analyst at eBEST Investment & Securities.  \u201cThe amount Hyundai Motor executives have sold after the media report is not a lot of money, and executives often sell or buy company stocks to turn them into profit.\u201d  In the October-to-December period, before local media reports on Apple talks, various Hyundai Motor executives conducted transactions in the company\u2019s shares worth about 580 billion won, Reuters calculations based on regulatory filings show.  Hyundai\u2019s smaller affiliate Kia, which had been tipped in media reports as recently as last week as the likely operational partner for Apple\u2019s car project, held an investor day event on Tuesday but made no mention of Apple.  Instead, it said it aims to boost its annual electric vehicle sales to 880,000 in 2030, a huge increase from this year\u2019s sales target of 59,000 vehicles.  Chief Financial Officer Joo Woo Jeong said Kia\u2019s electric vehicle business broke even in 2020. \u201cWe expect to achieve profitability in line with that of internal combustion engine cars by 2025,\u201d Joo said during an Investor Day event.

Several insurers have offered such subsidies for using wearable devices to meet generic activity goals such as a number of steps in the past. But what is new and significant about the Attain app is the use of personal health data held by Aetna to provide customized goals and recommendations.  That health history data is tightly regulated by the U.S. government, and Apple and Aetna had to enter into what is known as a business associate agreement in order for Aetna to share it with the Apple.  Access to regulated data is necessary for some of the functions of the app, such as recommending age-appropriate exercise or a lower-cost option for scheduled lab tests or MRI imaging tests.

For its second quarter, AMS said it expected sales to drop to between $220 million and $250 million, down from the $452.7 million in sales it reported for the first three months of 2018.  The downturn was based on weaker orders and lower forecast orders in the months ahead, Gmeiner said.  AMS added that changes in upcoming products, which prevented the pre-production of parts, mean that it also expects reduced utilization of factory capacity, which will hit profit margins.  The company, which also makes sensors used in cars and industrial gear, said the problem would be temporary and that preparations for ramping up production in the second half of the year remain on track.  The Swiss-quoted company also confirmed its mid-term growth and profitability guidance, aiming for a 60 percent compound annual growth rate between 2016 and 2019, combined with an adjusted EBIT margin target of 30 percent from 2019 onwards.  First-quarter net profit rose to $99.9 million from a loss of $19.9 million a year earlier.  AMS shares have gained 8.1 percent this year, outpacing a Stoxx 600 Technology Index that has gained 0.7 percent.

REUTERS\/Darren Hauck\/File Photo  The company, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, reported net profit of T$17.49 billion ($567.25 million) late on Monday, 20 percent short of analyst expectations and slightly below the year-earlier results. Foxconn shares fell more than 3 percent on Tuesday.  Analysts said the results reflected concerns about a loss of momentum in global smartphone sales. Last week, Foxconn unit FIH Mobile Ltd posted a wider first-half loss and acknowledged that it faced a high risk of saturation in the smartphone market.  Foxconn\u2019s results showed that its gross margin narrowed in the second-quarter in part owing to the cost of carrying unsold inventory of the iPhone X. Overall global smartphone shipments fell 3 percent to 350 million units in the April-June quarter compared with a year earlier, market research firm Strategy Analytics says.  However, Vincent Chen, an analyst at Yuanta Research, predicted a brighter outlook projected by Apple would benefit Foxconn and boost its margins in the third quarter.  Apple has forecast above-consensus revenue for later in the year, when it typically launches new iPhone models. Reports suggest these models will use OLED screens, which can display colors more vividly.  \u201cWe expect Hon Hai to be the main assembler of OLED version new iPhones and we believe the OLED iPhone model will see better demand in 2H18F,\u201d Chen said in a research note.  The company\u2019s report also illustrates its moves to diversify by pushing into new areas such as display screens - it bought Sharp Corp in 2016 - autonomous car startups and investments in cancer research.  Still, Foxconn earns most of its profits from manufacturing smartphones for Apple and other brands and from Foxconn Industrial Internet, a unit that makes networking equipment and smartphone casings, among other things.  \u201cInvestment in factory automation and component price hikes capped gross margin,\u201d said Fubon Research analyst Arthur Liao.  Foxconn\u2019s operating costs jumped 18.8 percent in the quarter.  Liao noted that Foxconn absorbed some expenses this quarter related to Sharp\u2019s planned acquisition of Toshiba\u2019s PC business, as well as development costs from setting up a factory in the United States, and taking Foxconn Industrial public in June.

The iPhone maker\u2019s automotive efforts, known as Project Titan, have proceeded unevenly since 2014 when it first started to design its own vehicle from scratch. At one point, Apple drew back the effort to focus on software and reassessed its goals. Doug Field, an Apple veteran who had worked at Tesla Inc , returned to oversee the project in 2018 and laid off 190 people from the team in 2019.  Since then, Apple has progressed enough that it now aims to build a vehicle for consumers, two people familiar with the effort said, asking not to be named because Apple\u2019s plans are not public. Apple\u2019s goal of building a personal vehicle for the mass market contrasts with rivals such as Alphabet Inc\u2019s Waymo, which has built robo-taxis to carry passengers for a driverless ride-hailing service.  Central to Apple\u2019s strategy is a new battery design that could \u201cradically\u201d reduce the cost of batteries and increase the vehicle\u2019s range, according to a third person who has seen Apple\u2019s battery design.  Apple declined to comment on its plans or future products.  Making a vehicle represents a supply chain challenge even for Apple, a company with deep pockets that makes hundreds of millions of electronics products each year with parts from around the world, but has never made a car. It took Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla 17 years before it finally turned a sustained profit making cars.  \u201cIf there is one company on the planet that has the resources to do that, it\u2019s probably Apple. But at the same time, it\u2019s not a cellphone,\u201d said a person who worked on Project Titan.  It remains unclear who would assemble an Apple-branded car, but sources have said they expect the company to rely on a manufacturing partner to build vehicles. And there is still a chance Apple will decide to reduce the scope of its efforts to an autonomous driving system that would be integrated with a car made by a traditional automaker, rather than the iPhone maker selling an Apple-branded car, one of the people added.  Two people with knowledge of Apple\u2019s plans warned pandemic-related delays could push the start of production into 2025 or beyond.  Apple has decided to tap outside partners for elements of the system, including lidar sensors, which help self-driving cars get a three-dimensional view of the road, two people familiar with the company\u2019s plans said.  Apple\u2019s car might feature multiple lidar sensors for scanning different distances, another person said. Some sensors could be derived from Apple\u2019s internally developed lidar units, that person said. Apple\u2019s iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro models released this year both feature lidar sensors.  Reuters had previously reported that Apple had held talks with potential lidar suppliers, but it was also examining building its own sensor.  As for the car\u2019s battery, Apple plans to use a unique \u201cmonocell\u201d design that bulks up the individual cells in the battery and frees up space inside the battery pack by eliminating pouches and modules that hold battery materials, one of the people said.  Apple\u2019s design means that more active material can be packed inside the battery, giving the car a potentially longer range. Apple is also examining a chemistry for the battery called LFP, or lithium iron phosphate, the person said, which is inherently less likely to overheat and is thus safer than other types of lithium-ion batteries.  \u201dIt\u2019s next level,\u201d the person said of Apple\u2019s battery technology. \u201cLike the first time you saw the iPhone.\u201d  Apple had previously engaged Magna International Inc in talks about manufacturing a car, but the talks petered out as Apple\u2019s plans became unclear, a person familiar with those previous efforts said. Magna did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  To turn a profit, automotive contract manufacturers often ask for volumes that could pose a challenge even to Apple, which would be a newcomer to the automotive market.  \u201cIn order to have a viable assembly plant, you need 100,000 vehicles annually, with more volume to come,\u201d the person said.

Major technology companies are battling for dominance in U.S. schools, a market seen as important for hooking young consumers.  Apple in March 2017 lowered the price of its 9.7-inch tablet to $329, the lowest starting price ever for one of its full-sized tablets. But laptops running operating systems by Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google or Microsoft Corp can be had for less than $200.  Apple\u2019s previous price cutting, along with software changes, have been followed by an improvement in iPad sales. Analysts believe the teacher- and student-geared event on Tuesday at Lane Tech College Prep High School will include an update to its iPad lineup, including possibly a lower-priced model.  Apple made up just 17 percent of the K-12 U.S. educational market in the third quarter, according to data from Futuresource Consulting. Meanwhile 60 percent of mobile computing shipments to schools ran Google\u2019s Chrome operating system, and 22 percent had Windows.  Chromebooks sold by Dell Technologies Inc can be had for as little as $189. Microsoft last year introduced an education-focused laptop from partner Lenovo Group Ltd running Window 10 S.  Apple in recent years made changes to its operating system so that more than one student can log into an iPad, and to its software to let teachers better manage groups of students.  But it faces a tough battle in the educational market given the popularity of Google and Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based productivity suites, said Carolina Milanesi of Creative Strategies. Google\u2019s G Suite fueled Chromebook sales because it was seen as easy to use to manage assignments.  \u201cMost teachers don\u2019t look past G Suite for education,\u201d she said. Apple has iWork, which added features in recent years but remains less familiar to teachers than Google\u2019s productivity suite or Microsoft\u2019s Office.  Education sales for iPads rose 32 percent to more than 1 million units in Apple\u2019s fiscal third quarter. Sales of iPads made up just 8.3 percent of Apple\u2019s $229.2 billion total revenue last year, however, compared with the nearly 62 percent of sales generated by iPhones.  Apple needs to keep working to regain market share in schools to get children interested in its devices later on, said TECHnalysis Research founder Bob O\u2019Donnell.  \u201cIt\u2019s more about the psychology of driving long-term preference for the (Apple) platform. It\u2019s more strategic than financial,\u201d he said.","739":"FILE PHOTO - An Apple logo hangs above the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in the Manhattan borough of New York City, July 21, 2015.

Apple is locked in race for subscribers with Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and others as streaming music becomes the dominant form of paid music consumption. Apple\u2019s number compares to 71 million premium subscribers at the end of 2017 at industry leader Spotify, which plans to list shares in the coming weeks on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol SPOT.  Apple said Eddy Cue, senior vice president of internet software and services, disclosed the most recent subscriber number for Apple Music at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas.  Amazon Music Unlimited has 16 million paying subscribers, and Pandora Media Inc has 5.48 million total subscribers. Google does not release paid subscriber numbers for its service, Google Play Music.  Apple, Spotify, Google and other services charge $9.99 a month for music. Amazon offers its service to members who already pay for its Prime membership, which includes shipping, video content and other benefits, for $7.99 per month.  In addition to its paid service, Spotify also offers an free ad-supported version to help draw users into the service. Apple Music does not offer an ad-based version and instead uses a three-month free trial to lure customers. Cue said Apple has 8 million subscribers currently in the free trial period, the first time Apple has disclosed the number of trial users.","740":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window.)  * Apple up as China sales steady, upbeat on accessories  * AMD rises on strong Q1, buoys chipmakers  * CVS jumps after raising FY profit forecast  * Fed to announce interest rate decision later in the day  * Futures up: Dow 0.36%, S&P 0.34%, Nasdaq 0.71% (Updates prices, adds prices)  By Shreyashi Sanyal  May 1 (Reuters) - Wall Street\u2019s main indexes were set to open higher on Wednesday, as Apple Inc\u2019s stellar results and forecast calmed concerns over slowing growth in corporate profits in the run up to the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest policy announcement.

The new AirPods, which will have up to 20 hours battery life, will be shipped starting next Tuesday, Apple said. But less than 12 hours after Apple announced the products, shipping times for U.S. customers had stretched past a dozen weeks, according to review of Apple\u2019s website, pushing arrival times well into 2021.  Because over-ear headphones create a seal around the ear, they are capable of delivering higher audio quality than in-ear devices and remain the standard form factor in professional studios. The AirPods Max model will compete with high-end headphones such as Bose\u2019s Noise Cancelling 700 units, which retail for $340 with holiday discounts.  At $549, AirPods Max headphones are more expensive than Apple\u2019s entry-level iPhone, iPad and Watch models. The company also said Tuesday that pricing for its base, in-ear AirPods model and AirPods Pro model would remain the same at $159 and $249, respectively.  The company said the AirPods Max contains nine microphones and two of its H1 chips, Apple\u2019s custom-designed audio processor. The microphones help reduce wind noise on phone calls, provide noise cancellation and also adjust audio levels in real time using microphones inside the ear cups.  The company\u2019s last quarter results showed a rise in sales in its accessories unit, even as revenue from its flagship iPhones dropped 20.7%, the steepest quarterly drop in two years.

And now, it has taken away a closely watched performance metric that it has disclosed to investors for 20 years.  The Cupertino, California-based company on Thursday said that it will stop reporting unit sales data for its iPhone, iPad and Mac computer products, the latter of which it has given out since 1998. Analysts and investors use the figures to calculate the average selling price of Apple\u2019s devices and gauge the health of the company.  Apple said the data is less relevant to the strength of its business as customers bundle products, such as an iPhone paired with its wireless AirPods headphones, along with paid subscription services like Apple Music to listen to songs and iCloud storage for photos. Analysts were skeptical.  \u201cCompanies typically stop reporting metrics when the metrics are about to turn. This is not a good look for Apple,\u201d said analyst Walter Piecyk from BTIG Research.  The move cost Apple dearly, helping to send shares down about 7 percent in after-hours trading. They later settled at $207.81, about 6.5 percent below their previous close.  \u201cApple is a complex company with lot of moving parts,\u201d said analyst Ivan Fienseth from Tigress \u201cI think they need to give more transparency to their shareholders and not less.\u201d  But now, Apple will give cost-of-sales data for both its total product businesses and its total services business, which will let investors evaluate a gross margin for both. In the past, Apple gave only an overall gross margin figure for the company.  The new numbers are important for two reasons. First, they will show just how lucrative Apple\u2019s hardware business really is. But more importantly, for the first time they give margin information on Apple\u2019s services business, which reached $10 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter, up 17 percent.  Many of Apple\u2019s fastest-growing businesses are subscription based, like its $9.99 a month Apple Music service. And investors tend to value subscription business through a combination of their revenue growth rate and margins - information that Apple investors will now have, said Tien Tzuo, chief executive of Zuora Inc, a company that helps subscription businesses track their finances.  But one problem Apple investors will face is not knowing what the margin mix is within the services business. Some parts of it, like iCloud storage, are likely lucrative, but others, like Apple Music, are probably less so because Apple has to pay music licenses costs and competes with rival Spotify Technology SA.  \u201cYou would value the music business with one (revenue) multiple closer to Spotify, and the cloud business with a (subscription software) multiple,\u201d said Tzuo. \u201cHaving some sense of which business is growing faster would be nice.\u201d","746":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes tumbled on Monday as shares of Apple Inc AAPL.O and Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N dragged down the technology and financial sectors.

Like the Big Tech companies, the would-be intervenors question the lawfulness of the USPTO\u2019s \u201cNHK-Fintiv\u201d rule \u2013 a list of factors the agency has decided are relevant when considering whether to review the validity of a patent that is also being litigated in court.  However, the tech giants only seek to block the use of the NHK-Fintiv factors. US Inventor\u2019s motion seeks to compel the USPTO to adopt standards via formal regulation - and to shut down the agency\u2019s review of existing patents until the regulatory process is completed, Friday\u2019s ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Davila said.  Apple and the other tech companies \u201cdefined the general scope of the suit and the Proposed Intervenors cannot now by intervention radically alter that scope to create a much different case,\u201d Davila wrote.  Google attorney Daniel Shvodian of Perkins Coie declined to comment on Monday. Apple, Cisco and Intel are represented by attorneys at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, who did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The proposed intervenors\u2019 attorneys at Flachsbart & Greenspoon and Hudnell Law Group also had no immediate response.  The tech companies sued then-USPTO Director Andrei Iancu in federal court in San Jose last August, after the agency\u2019s Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) declared its 2018 decision in NHK and its March decision in Fintiv to be precedential.  In NHK, the PTAB decided it was inefficient to institute an inter partes review (IPR) when trial was imminent in a parallel patent-infringement case in federal court.  In Fintiv, the PTAB spelled out six litigation-related factors it would consider when deciding whether to institute IPR.  Apple and the other tech companies argue that the litigation-related factors are not authorized by the America Invents Act of 2011, which created the IPR process, and that the new rule creates \u201cunjustifiable and unpredictable disparities among similarly-situated IPR petitioners.\u201d The complaint also alleges that the rule is \u201cprocedurally invalid.\u201d  US Inventor \u2013 joined by 360 Heros, Larry Golden, World Source Enterprises, Dareltech, Tinnus Enterprises, Clearplay and E-Watch \u2013 filed a motion to intervene in the suit in September. They do not oppose the NHK-Fintiv factors, but argue that the USPTO should adopt standards via a formal rulemaking process after publication and a comment period.  The USPTO published a request for comments in October, as a result of an August petition by US Inventor. In addition to its motion to intervene, US Inventor sought a restraining order and injunction to block the USPTO from \u201cgranting institution in any AIA patent trial\u201d until the rulemaking process is finished.  Those collateral issues would \u201cunduly delay and prejudice the adjudication of the original parties\u2019 case,\u201d Davila held.  On Feb. 12, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is scheduled to hear an unrelated challenge to the NHK-Fintiv rule. In that case, Viatris Inc (formerly Mylan Pharmaceuticals) claims the rule was unconstitutionally applied to its petition for review of a Janssen Pharmaceutica patent.

The case, brought by Qualcomm, is part of a global patent dispute between the two U.S. companies that includes dozens of lawsuits. It creates uncertainty over Apple\u2019s business in one of its biggest markets at a time when concerns over waning demand for new iPhones are battering its shares.  Apple said on Monday that all of its phone models remained on sale in mainland China and that it had filed a request for reconsideration with the court, the first step in a long appeal process that could end up at China\u2019s Supreme Court.  \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly unlikely, I\u2019d say almost impossible (that Apple would have to stop sales),\u201d said a Beijing-based IP lawyer who is not directly connected with the Qualcomm case but has worked with large U.S. tech firms.  \u201cIn all likelihood it will drag on for some time. It\u2019s worth keeping in mind that this is just one battle in a larger rift\u201d, he said, referring to the legal fight between Qualcomm and Apple that stretches from European courts to South Korea.  Qualcomm said in a statement the Fuzhou Intermediate People\u2019s Court in China found Apple infringed two patents held by the chipmaker and ordered an immediate ban on sales of older iPhone models, from the 6S through the X.  Apple said the trio of new models released in September were not part of the case.  \u201cQualcomm\u2019s effort to ban our products is another desperate move by a company whose illegal practices are under investigation by regulators around the world,\u201d Apple said.  Reuters couldn\u2019t immediately reach the court for comment.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Qualcomm is seen during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 27, 2018. REUTERS\/Yves Herman\/File Photo  China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are Apple\u2019s third-largest market, accounting for about one-fifth of Apple\u2019s $265.6 billion in sales in its most recent fiscal year.  Qualcomm, the biggest supplier of chips for mobile phones, filed its case in China in late 2017, arguing that Apple infringed patents on features related to resizing photographs and managing apps on a touch screen.  COURT BATTLE OVER DETAILS  In July, the same court banned the import of some microchips by Micron Technology Inc into China, citing violation of patents held by Taiwan\u2019s United Microelectronics Corp (UMC).  In the provincial Chinese court, which is separate from China\u2019s specialized intellectual property courts in Beijing, one party can request a ban on an opponent\u2019s product without the opponent getting a chance to present a defense.  IP lawyers said that an appeal process could take the case up to the Fujian provincial high court and then go as far as the Supreme Court in Beijing, a process that would likely take many months given the high-profile nature of the case.  To enforce the ban, Qualcomm separately will have to file complaints in what is known as an enforcement tribunal, where Apple will also have a chance to appeal.  Yiqiang Li, a patent lawyer at Faegre Baker Daniels, said the Chinese injunction could put pressure on Apple to reach a global settlement with Qualcomm.  Apple shares rose less than 1 percent to $169.60, recovering from an early drop when it became clear phones were still on sale, and Qualcomm stock rose 2.2 percent to $57.24.  TRADE WAR IMPACT?  The ruling comes as Beijing and Washington are locked in a tense trade dispute. The two sides have agreed to trade negotiations that must be concluded by March 1.  While IP lawyers said the case wasn\u2019t directly political, most agreed it could be drawn into broader Sino-U.S. trade tensions, where technology and IP have been a core focus.  The specific iPhone models affected by the preliminary ruling in China are the iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X.  Erick Robinson, a patent lawyer in Beijing and former Qualcomm lawyer, said that while Chinese courts had become fairer in recent years, nationalism could sometimes be a factor in rulings.  Qualcomm is a key technology vendor to China\u2019s rising smart phone brands such as Xiaomi Corp, Oppo, Vivo and OnePlus, while Apple competes directly against Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], China\u2019s top homegrown maker of premium-priced smartphones, whose CFO was arrested this month for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions.  \u201cThere is probably a political play here. Apple is a direct competitor to the biggest companies in China, whereas Qualcomm is a supplier,\u201d Robinson said.  Qualcomm officials said tensions between the two nations had no bearing on the ruling. The company has had its share of troubles in China, from an unfavorable 2014 antitrust ruling to regulatory limbo that doomed its $44 billion bid for Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors.","756":"Dec 22 (Reuters) - Silicon Valley billionaire Elon Musk said on Tuesday he reached out to Apple Inc\u2019s Tim Cook \u201cduring the darkest days of the Model 3 program\u201d to discuss the possibility of Apple acquiring Tesla Inc for \u201c1\/10th of our current value.\u201d \u201cHe refused to take the meeting,\u201d said Musk replying to a Twitter chain which cited a Reuters story on Apple targeting 2024 to produce a passenger vehicle that could include its own breakthrough battery technology on Monday.

Importantly, Foxconn will be assembling the most expensive models, such as devices in the flagship iPhone X family, the source said, potentially taking Apple\u2019s business in India to a new level.  The work will take place at Foxconn\u2019s plant in Sriperumbudur town in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, said the source, who is not authorized to speak to the media and so declined to be named.  Foxconn, which already makes phones for Xiaomi Corp in India, will invest 25 billion Indian rupees ($356 million) to expand the plant, including investment in iPhone production, Tamil Nadu\u2019s Industries Minister M C Sampath told Reuters.  The investment may create as many as 25,000 jobs, he added.  Another source also said Foxconn planned to assemble iPhones in India, in a move that could help both it and Apple to limit the impact of a trade war between the United States and China.  The Hindu newspaper first reported on Dec. 24 that the Foxconn plant would begin manufacturing various models of the iPhone. Reuters is first to report the size of the investment and the kind of phones to be assembled.  Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. Foxconn said it did not comment on matters related to current or potential customers, or any of their products.  A motorcyclist rides past the logo of Foxconn, the trading name of Hon Hai Precision Industry, in Taipei, Taiwan March 30, 2018. REUTERS\/Tyrone Siu  LOWER-END PHONES  Until now, Cupertino, California-based Apple has only assembled the lower-cost SE and 6S models in India through Wistron Corp\u2019s local unit in the Bengaluru technology hub.  Its sales in India have also been focused on lower-end phones - more than half of its sales volume is driven by models older than the iPhone 8, launched last year, according to technology research firm Counterpoint.  Apple launched the pricey iPhone X last year but has cut production of that phone, according to industry analysts, since it began selling the newer versions, iPhone XS and XR, globally this year.  Still, it could potentially get Foxconn to make the older iPhone X version in India where it sells cheaper models in a bid to get a bigger share of the world\u2019s fastest growing major mobile phone market.  Full details of Apple\u2019s deal with Foxconn are not yet clear and could change.  It is not known if any of the iPhone assembly is being moved from existing Foxconn factories in China and elsewhere. It is also unclear whether the production will be confined to assembly or include any component production in India.  LOOKING BEYOND CHINA  For Apple, widening assembly beyond China is critical to mitigate the risks of the Sino-U.S. trade war.  Foxconn, the world\u2019s biggest electronics contract manufacturer, is considering setting up a factory in Vietnam, Vietnamese state media reported this month. If that goes ahead, it will be one of the biggest recent steps by a major company to secure an additional production base outside of China.  Foxconn has previously admitted the China-U.S. trade spat was its biggest challenge and that its senior executives were making plans to counter the impact.  \u201cWidening iPhone manufacturing in India through Foxconn will allow Apple to hedge the risk of any new U.S. trade policies,\u201d said Navkendar Singh, an associate research director at International Data Corporation.  Indian taxes on import of devices and components have also heightened Apple\u2019s headache in a market where it has only a 1 percent share by smartphone shipments.  Making more phones locally will help Apple save costly duties and boost Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s flagship drive to make India a manufacturing hub, Singh said.  Apple shocked investors last month with a lower-than-expected sales forecast for the Christmas quarter that jolted parts suppliers across the world.  Foxconn has previously expressed concern over demand for Apple\u2019s flagship devices.","765":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O said on Tuesday it plans to remove carbon emissions from its entire business, including its products and sprawling supply chain, over the next decade.  FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc. logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, New York, U.S., October 16, 2019. REUTERS\/Mike Segar  The iPhone maker said its global corporate operations such as offices and data centers are already carbon neutral but that it will extend its effort to the thousands of suppliers that contribute to its products.  Apple said it aims to achieve 75% of the goal by reducing emissions, with the remaining 25% coming from carbon removal or offset projects such as planting trees and restoring habitats.  For its supply chain, Apple aims to address what are termed \"scope three\" emissions, which come indirectly from a company's value chain. In Apple's case, this means contract manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd's 2317.TW Foxconn.  Apple said 74% of its overall carbon emissions are generated by product manufacturing. To address the scope three emissions from manufacturing, Apple said it will help set up a $100 million \u201cU.S.-China Green Fund\u201d to provide capital investments to suppliers for energy efficiency projects.  The company has also been working with suppliers to reduce emissions by using recycled materials, saying its iPhones now use recycled rare earth elements in a component called the taptic engine.  Rare earth elements are energy intensive to mine but are often used in amounts too small to make recycling economical. Apple said it has created a robot to recover the materials from some of its devices.  Apple said its carbon removal or offset efforts will come via a fund to assist projects such as restoring mangrove ecosystems in Colombia and savannas in Kenya. The company did not disclose a dollar figure for the fund.  Apple's nature-based carbon removal strategy contrasts with other companies such as Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, which earlier this year said it would invest $1 billion over the next four years in engineering-based carbon removal technologies.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple and Qualcomm have faced up to their mutual need. The $940 billion smartphone maker and $85 billion mobile-chip firm on Tuesday ended a two-year fight over royalties with a licensing agreement and a cash payment to Qualcomm. Apple can\u2019t risk being stuck with second-rate semiconductors in its devices, and Qualcomm has huge revenue at stake. At first blush, both sides benefit from the truce.  Their lawyers have been kept busy since 2017 by the argument over how Qualcomm charges for chips that connect smartphones to data networks. Apple accused Qualcomm of withholding parts from suppliers unless they agreed to pay high royalties, something the iPhone maker said was anti-competitive. Qualcomm said Apple had put pressure on suppliers not to pay. The numbers were pretty big, even for such huge companies: Apple was seeking as much as $27 billion in damages, while its supplier-cum-adversary wanted up to $15 billion.  The nature of the truce is hazy. Neither side is saying how big Apple\u2019s payment is, or what future royalties will be. Qualcomm did point out in a presentation to investors, however, that it expects an incremental $2 per share of earnings; details on exactly how and when that flows through are nonexistent, but with 1.2 billion shares outstanding, that probably implies a hefty payment. History suggests Apple, meanwhile, will get sweeter terms than it had before the dispute. About a decade ago, then-dominant phone maker Nokia and Qualcomm settled a similar dispute with Nokia getting a discount.  Investors seem to believe there are no losers.

REUTERS\/Elijah Nouvelage\/File Photo  Shares in the Cupertino, California firm had fallen 5 percent, or more than $40 billion in market value, in the two weeks before the report, thanks largely to a soft outlook from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 2330.TW which was read as pointing to weak demand for iPhones.  Yet while investors were bracing for weak smartphone sales, Apple sold 52.2 million iPhones, just shy of analysts\u2019 estimate of 52.3 million.  At least four brokerages raised their price targets for Apple stock. Of 43 analysts covering, 29 have a \u201cbuy\u201d or higher rating and 14 on \u201chold\u201d. No one has a \u201csell\u201d rating.  \u201ciPhone unit sales were better than feared with our recently lowered estimates, and management highlighted consistent results in every geography with the iPhone X the top selling iPhone each week of the quarter,\u201d Canaccord Genuity analyst T. Michael Walkley said.  Two other analysts estimated Apple would sell about 40 million iPhones in the current quarter, based on Apple\u2019s June quarter revenue forecast of $51.5 billion to $53.5 billion and shares in Apple parts suppliers were also broadly higher.  Shares of AMS AMS.S, which provides the facial recognition technology used in Apple's iPhones, rose as much as 8 percent on Wednesday morning.  Those in Cirrus Logic CRUS.O, Skyworks Solutions SWKS.O, Lumentum Holdings LITE.O, Broadcom AVGO.O and Qualcomm QCOM.O were all gainers.  \u201cWhile forecasted iPhone shipments of 39 million units is lower than our 42 million estimate a month ago, it\u2019s far better than our 34 million estimate which reflected the weaker June quarter outlook from suppliers like TSMC and AMS,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said.  The $999 iPhone X, which features an edge-to-edge display and facial recognition technology to unlock the phone, has been plagued by supply bottlenecks and concerns about weak sales since it went on sale in November in the United States.  While Apple\u2019s iPhone sales were marginally lower than consensus forecasts, its quarterly results still beat Wall Street targets, helped by a $9.1 billion revenue contribution from Apple\u2019s services business.  \u201cServices sales growth of 31 percent Y\/Y was robust this quarter, and well above expectations, reflecting broad strength across Apple\u2019s offerings, including App Store, Apple Music, iCloud and Apple Pay,\u201d Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner said.  Apple also promised to hike its dividend by 16 percent and to buyback $100 billion worth of additional stock, which analysts said would create a floor for shares.  After a solid quarter that quashed most concerns about a slowdown, eyes will now turn to the next generation of iPhones to be launched in September.  \u201cWith our belief Apple will launch an iPhone X plus type combined with new improved features for the current sized iPhone X product, we believe Apple\u2019s iPhone franchise will extend strong sales of higher-priced iPhones through C2019,\u201d Walkley said.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The lawsuit follows an earlier case that Intel filed against Fortress in October. Intel withdrew that lawsuit and on Wednesday filed a new version in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with Apple joining as a plaintiff.  Intel and Apple allege that Fortress and firms it either owned or whose patent portfolios it effectively controlled - and which do not make any technology products - stockpiled patents for the primary purpose of suing technology companies and did so in a manner that violated U.S. antitrust laws.  \u201cApple has suffered economic harm in the form of litigation costs and diversion of resources away from innovation to respond to these entities\u2019 serial nuisance suits,\u201d Apple wrote in the complaint.

China reported its fewest new coronavirus infections since January and its lowest daily death toll in a week, but the World Health Organization said data suggesting the epidemic had slowed should be viewed with caution.  Apple said on Monday that manufacturing facilities in China that produce its iPhone and other electronics had begun to reopen, but were ramping up more slowly than expected.  The disruption in China will result in fewer iPhones available for sale around the world, making Apple one of the largest Western firms to be hurt by the outbreak.  Gold climbed more than 1% to a two-week high as investors sought safety in the wake of Apple\u2019s warning and the price of Brent, the global crude benchmark, fell below $57 a barrel.  Forecasters, including the International Energy Agency (IEA), have cut 2020 oil demand estimates because of the virus.  Equity markets around the world fell, with MSCI\u2019s all-country world index slipping 0.72%.  The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.38% and emerging market stocks lost 1.28%.  HSBC Holdings PLC\u2019s announcement that it would shed $100 billion in assets, shrink its investment bank and revamp its U.S. and European businesses in a drastic overhaul added to concerns about the impact of the coronavirus.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Throughout the first trading day of 2019 investors piled into safe-haven investments like longer-dated Treasuries and German bunds after weak data out of China and Europe was reported overnight and a partial shutdown of the U.S. government continued.  Yields on benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR fell to their lowest since late last January. They hit a fresh 11-month low near 2.62 percent late in the day when Apple announced sales would fall well short of previous forecasts largely because of a slowdown in demand for its iPhones in China.  China\u2019s economy was already of central concern after a measure of its manufacturing activity shrank for the first time in 19 months in December, hit by the Chinese-U.S. trade war, with the weakness spilling over to other Asian economies.  \u201cChinese PMI came in weaker than expected and gave a risk-off tone to global markets. There are now mounting concerns about global growth,\u201d said Justin Lederer, Treasury analyst and trader at Cantor Fitzgerald.  The 10-year note yield was last at 2.63 percent, breaching the key technical level of 2.64 percent. Ten-year yields fell nearly 6 basis points on the day, their largest one-day fall in a month.  Other safe-haven investments also benefited in price from the flight to quality. The benchmark 10-year German government bond yield DE10YT=RR was down 7 basis points, last at 0.17 percent.  While U.S. stocks eked out modest gains on Wednesday to start the new year, after their poorest yearly showing in a decade in 2018, Apple\u2019s weak sales forecast after Wall Street closed sent equity index futures sharply lower, bringing in further support for Treasuries.  The grim readings from Asia\u2019s and Europe\u2019s purchasing manager surveys came ahead of the closely watched U.S. manufacturing survey on Thursday, payrolls data on Friday and the U.S. earnings season later this month, which is expected to show corporate profit shrank in the October-December quarter.  Oil prices rose about 4 percent in choppy trading on Wednesday, supported by gains in U.S. equity markets, but concerns remained about rising crude production and weakening global economic growth.  The yield on the two-year Treasury note US2YT=RR was supported by the rise in oil prices, last up about half a basis point to 2.504 percent.

LG Display, which supplies mobile OLED panels for Apple\u2019s iPhone 12, said an expanded supply of mobile OLED panels to an identified strategic customer in North America, helped lift its earnings and it is using its full production capacity to respond to demand from the customer.  It said it will be able to resume business with Huawei after the company along with other suppliers gain U.S. export licences.  \u201cStrategically speaking, it\u2019s a very important client for the company, but when it comes to the volume itself, we are not at the stage of providing mass volume, so when it comes to the impact on business itself, it\u2019s more than manageable.\u201d Chief Financial Officer Suh Dong-hee said during an earnings briefing.  LG Display, which said in January it would halt domestic production of LCD TV panels by year end, said there is no change to its plan to revamp its LCD business structure, but suggested that it would keep some of capacity for the time being to respond to solid demand for TVs.  It said the start of its China OLED TV display fab contributed to its earnings rise, and expected annual sales to reach around 4.5 million units this year, although this would fall short of its earlier target of 6 million, as the pandemic hit demand for high-end TVs earlier in the year.","778":"The California Supreme Court on Thursday said state law requires Apple Inc to pay retail employees for time spent having their bags and personal devices checked at the end of their shifts, in a ruling that could be costly for retailers and companies that operate factories and warehouses in California.

The change follows lawsuits by \"Fortnite\" video game maker Epic Games last month accusing Google and Apple Inc AAPL.O of anticompetitive conduct. Apps sold on the tech leaders' stores are required to use their payment systems so they can collect a portion of sales, which developers describe as a tax. The companies are defending the allegations.  App stores are a fast-growing business as sales of Google\u2019s search ads and Apple\u2019s iPhone flatten out.  Google said under 3% of developers with apps on its Play store sold digital goods over the last 12 months, and nearly 97% comply with its payment system policy.  Dating apps maker Match Group Inc MTCH.O is among the companies that have publicly said they do not pay Google's 30% fee, which decreases to 15% in subsequent years if it is for a subscription service.  Antitrust regulators in several countries are looking at the issue, including in South Korea, where several media apps anticipating Google\u2019s stricter enforcement preemptively complained to government officials recently.  Apps have said 30% is excessive compared with the 2% fees of typical credit card payments processors, while Apple and Google say the amount covers the security and marketing benefits their app stores provide.  New apps must use Google\u2019s payments tool for sales by Jan. 20, while existing apps have until Sept. 30, 2021.

Apple\u2019s quarterly results topped Wall Street forecasts, which dropped ahead of the report on growing concern over the iPhone. The Cupertino, California-based company also was more optimistic about the current quarter than most financial analysts, driving shares up 3.6 percent to $175.25 after hours.  Suppliers around the globe had warned of smartphone weakness, playing into fears that the company known for popularizing personal computers, tablets and smartphones had become too reliant on the iPhone.  Sales of 52.2 million iPhones against a Wall Street target of 52.3 million was a comfort and up from 50.7 million last year, according to data from Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Apple bought $23.5 billion of stock in the March quarter, and said it planned to hike its dividend 16 percent, compared with a 10.5 percent increase last year. Analysts believe the heavy emphasis on buybacks will bolster share prices, but some investors wished Apple had found different uses for the cash.  \u201cI\u2019d hoped for more on the dividend side or maybe a strategic investment,\u201d said Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel. \u201cI assume Apple can\u2019t find a strategic investment at the current prices that will move the needle for them. The $100 billion buyback is good for right now but it\u2019s not exactly looking to the future.\u201d  The cash Apple earmarked for stock buybacks is about twice the $50 billion market capitalization of electric car maker Tesla Inc.  Apple posted revenue for its March quarter of $61.1 billion, up from $52.9 billion last year. Wall Street expected $60.8 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Average selling prices for iPhones were $728, compared with Wall Street expectations of $742. The figure is up more than 10 percent from $655 a year ago, suggesting Apple\u2019s iPhone X, which starts at $999, has helped boost prices.  Analysts had feared the high price was muting demand for the iPhone X, but Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said it was the most popular iPhone model every week in the March quarter.  \u201cThis is the first cycle that we\u2019ve ever had where the top of the line iPhone model has also been the most popular,\u201d Cook said during the company\u2019s earnings call.  \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things like when a team wins the Super Bowl, maybe you want them to win by a few more points. But it\u2019s a Super Bowl winner and that\u2019s how we feel about it.\u201d  The iPhone X has shaped up to be \u201ca good, not a great product. There was a time prior to its introduction that investors expected it to be a great product,\u201d said Thomas Forte, an analyst with D.A. Davidson Companies.  \u201cNow that we know it is a good product, as investors have lowered expectations, that is enough, in my view, for shares to go higher from current levels.\u201d  Positive iPhone news boosted shares of chip suppliers.  Skyworks Solutions Inc rose 2.9 percent, Broadcom Inc was up 2 percent, while Cirrus Logic gained 4.3 percent.  Apple also predicted revenue of $51.5 billion to $53.5 billion in the June quarter, ahead of the $51.6 billion Wall Street expected as of Monday evening, and the share repurchases in the March quarter drove Apple\u2019s cash net of debt down slightly to $145 billion.

Profits were $2.73 per share versus expectations of $2.68 per share, as of Monday, and up from $2.10 a year ago.  Apple\u2019s services business, which includes Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud, posted $9.1 billion in revenue compared with expectations of $8.3 billion. Heading into earnings, investors were hopeful that growth in that segment could help offset the cooling global smartphone market.  Julie Ask, an analyst with Forrester, said Apple\u2019s services segment results were positive but warned that Apple needed to continue to boost subscriptions on its platforms, which reached 270 million users in the March quarter and includes people who subscribe to third-party apps on the iPhone as well as Apple\u2019s own services like iCloud.  \u201cApps are carrying most (services revenue) right now, but Apple needs to get to a place where it\u2019s mostly subscriptions and monthly fees and not just one-off downloads,\u201d Ask said.  Apple traditionally updates its share buyback and dividend program each spring, and the $100 billion it added this year compares with an increase of $50 billion last year. (Graphic: Apple Buys Back Shares - reut.rs\/2JIjkgo)  In February, Apple said it planned to draw down its excess cash, although Cook had downplayed the possibility of a special dividend.  But investors have had concerns around Apple because of brewing trade tensions with China.  Greater China sales rose 21 percent from a year earlier, Apple\u2019s best growth rate there in 10 quarters, to $13.0 billion. While there has not yet been a tariff on devices such as Apple\u2019s iPhone, Cook traveled last week to Washington to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House to discuss trade matters.  \u201cChina only wins if the U.S. wins and the U.S. only wins if China wins,\u201d Cook said on the call, when asked about a possible trade war. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer that the two countries together can both win and grow the pie, not just allocate it differently,\u201d he said.  Apple has been emphasizing its contributions to the U.S. economy in recent months, outlining a $30 billion U.S. spending plan and highlighting the tens of billions of dollars it spends each year with U.S.-based suppliers.  In recent months, Apple has been emphasizing the size of its overall user base, which includes used iPhones, rather than focusing strictly on new device sales, a sign of the increasing importance of making money off users without selling them new hardware.","783":"WASHINGTON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - A second U.S. judge late on Monday granted a preliminary injunction blocking the U.S. Commerce Department from imposing restrictions on Chinese-owned short video sharing app TikTok that the company says would have effectively barred its use in the United States.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  The ruling safeguards \u201cFortnite\u201d creator Epic\u2019s computer graphics software Unreal Engine, which it offers through an affiliate business and which hundreds of games and other apps use to power their apps on Apple\u2019s iPhones.  \u201cEpic Games and Apple are at liberty to litigate against each other, but their dispute should not create havoc to bystanders,\u201d Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers wrote in a ruling late on Monday.  The legal battle arose after Apple this month removed Epic\u2019s \u201cFortnite\u201d game from Apple\u2019s App Store and an affiliated account, effectively blocking distribution of Unreal Engine, when Epic rolled out its own method of in-game purchases in \u201cFortnite\u201d rather than using the required Apple system that charges commission of between 15% and 30%.  Epic then alleged in a lawsuit and social media campaign that Apple has engaged in anticompetitive behavior by abusing its dominance in the market for iPhone apps, marking the highest-profile challenge to app store business.  Epic had sought to reverse its punishments by Apple until the broader case could be decided.  Gonzalez Rogers said \u201cthe current predicament (with \u201cFortnite\u201d) appears of its own making\u201d and refused to order its reinstatement. But she allowed Unreal Engine to continue powering iPhone apps, saying that Apple\u2019s actions against Epic\u2019s affiliates had been too severe because they had not breached the iPhone maker\u2019s policies as \u201cFortnite\u201d had.  During a terse exchange with Apple counsel Richard Doren at a hearing on Monday, the judge said she saw \u201cno competition\u201d to Apple\u2019s App Store on the iPhone.  \u201cThe question is, without competition, where does the 30% (App Store commission) come from? Why isn\u2019t it 10? 20? How is the consumer benefiting?\u201d she asked.  Doren replied that consumers had choices when deciding to buy an Android device or an iPhone.  \u201cThe competition is in the foremarket,\u201d he said, reiterating an argument that has been central to Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook\u2019s defense during Congressional antitrust hearings.  Gonzalez Rogers replied that there was \u201cplenty of economic theory\u201d to show that switching brands imposed costs on consumers.  She at one point muted Doren in the virtual proceedings.

Bloomberg Businessweek on Thursday cited 17 unnamed intelligence and company sources as saying that Chinese spies had placed computer chips inside equipment used by around 30 companies, as well as multiple U.S. government agencies, which would give Beijing secret access to internal networks.  \u201cWe are aware of the media reports but at this stage have no reason to doubt the detailed assessments made by AWS and Apple,\u201d said the National Cyber Security Centre, a unit of Britain\u2019s eavesdropping agency, GCHQ. AWS refers to Amazon Web Services, the company\u2019s cloud-computing unit.  \u201cThe NCSC engages confidentially with security researchers and urges anybody with credible intelligence about these reports to contact us,\u201d it said.  Apple contested the Bloomberg report on Thursday, saying in a statement that its own internal investigations found no evidence to support the story\u2019s claims and that neither the company, nor its contacts in law enforcement, were aware of any investigation by the FBI into the matter.

The iPhone maker said developers will automatically get the lower 15% rate if they generate $1 million or less in proceeds - defined as the portion of store purchases that the developer keeps - in a calendar year.  Apple's App Store fees and rules have come under fire from large firms such as Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Spotify Technology SA SPOT.N, Match Group Inc MTCH.O and Epic Games as well as startups and smaller companies that allege the fees deprive consumers of choices and push up the price of apps.  \u201cThis would be something to celebrate were it not a calculated move by Apple to divide app creators and preserve their monopoly on stores and payments, again breaking the promise of treating all developers equally,\u201d Epic Games Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney said.  In reply to its critics, the iPhone maker had said its rules apply evenly to developers and that the App Store provides an easy way to reach its huge base of users without having to set up payment systems in the 175 countries where it operates.  The move will affect a broad swath of developers, but it was unclear how big the financial impact would be for Apple.  Moody\u2019s estimates that lower commissions will impact less than 1% of Apple\u2019s revenue and operating profit and it will benefit from the goodwill from thousands of small developers.  \u201cApple\u2019s announcement that it cut its commissions in half for software developers earning less than $1 million annually from its App Store is credit positive,\u201d said Raj Joshi, Moody\u2019s senior credit officer.  Based on the publishers it tracks, analytics firm Sensor Tower said 97.5% of iOS developers generated less than $1 million per year in gross consumer spending. But those same developers contributed only 4.9% of the App Store\u2019s 2019 revenue.  However, Gene Munster of Loup Ventures, a longtime Apple analyst, estimated the small developers covered under the program make up 20% of Apple\u2019s App store revenue. He lowered his estimate for Apple\u2019s store revenue in its next fiscal year to $14.2 billion, a $1.6 billion reduction from his estimate before the policy change and about 0.5% of Apple\u2019s overall revenue.  The App Association, a group sponsored by Apple, said in a statement the \u201creduced commission for small businesses will allow them to put additional resources towards scaling up and innovating new products and services.\u201d  Match Group said Apple\u2019s rules still forced developers to use its payment system even when Apple competes against those developers.  \u201cAnd if you manage to grow your revenue over $1 million, they then double their cut \u2013 arbitrarily \u2013 making it even harder for the startup to continue to grow,\u201d the company said.

But the discount window did not stay open long, with Apple\u2019s stock back at a record high above $183 on Friday after trading in the mid-$150s for part of the first quarter.  The recovery in the share prices makes it less opportune for Apple\u2019s corporate treasury to execute purchases as it proceeds with an additional $100 billion of buybacks in an effort to further winnow down its mountain of cash.  Apple bought more than $23 billion of its own shares in the first three months of the year at an average price of $171.48, the company said this week. A Buffett representative on Friday confirmed Berkshire Hathaway increased its stake in Apple by 75 million shares, for which the company looks to have paid between $12 billion and $13 billion, based on the stock\u2019s trading range during the period.  Funds from the repatriation of Apple\u2019s $252 billion overseas cash hoard arrived at an convenient time for traders working on behalf of Apple. The Cupertino, California, company\u2019s massive share purchase in the March quarter coincided with a 10 percent slump in the S&P 500 between Jan 26 and Feb 8.  That drop raised fears across Wall Street that a nine-year bull market was ending and made it easier for big players amassing shares in a company to find willing sellers.  Apple shares fell even more than the broader market, tumbling over 13 percent from their record high close. But while the S&P 500 has remained in correction territory, Apple shares quickly recovered, and it seems the company and Berkshire were there to help.  Buffett, a billionaire bargain hunter, increased his company\u2019s stake to 240.3 million shares worth $42.5 billion during first quarter.  At its low in February, the stock was available for as little as $150, an 18 percent discount to its current price.  On more than a third of the trading days during the March quarter, Apple\u2019s stock traded below its volume weighted average price, or VWAP, for the prior 60 days.  On Feb 8, when it closed at $155.15, the low for the quarter, it was at a nearly 10 percent discount from its 60-day average VWAP. The stock had not been available at such a large discount to its prevailing average since May 2016, which happens to be when Buffett bought his first-ever shares of Apple.  At its close of $183.83 on Friday, however, Apple now stands at a premium of nearly 7 percent to its 60-day VWAP of $172.11.  Prior to last quarter, Apple\u2019s largest-ever quarterly repurchase occurred in early 2014, a year after it initiated its first $210 billion buyback program. The stock traded at a discount to its 60-day VWAP through much of the quarter, and Apple spent $18 billion to buy up its own shares, according to filings.

Following a poor forecast earlier this month, analysts and investors voiced concern over the state of Apple\u2019s business, contributing to growing worries that iPhone sales were stagnating and could hurt suppliers.  Fresh warnings on Monday from screen maker Japan Display Inc 6740.T, British chipmaker IQE Plc IQE.L and Lumentum Holdings Inc LITE.O, the main supplier of the Face ID technology in the latest generation of iPhones, hurt technology stocks in Asia on Tuesday.  Taiwan-based assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn) 2317.TW dropped more than 3 percent. Rival Pegatron Corp 4938.TW fell more than 5 percent but later recouped losses.

Japan Display lowered both sales and margin outlook for the year as well.  NO CONFIDENCE  Apple warned earlier this month that holiday sales would miss Wall Street expectations due to weakness in emerging markets including India and foreign-exchange costs.  Among other Apple suppliers in Asia, Hong Kong-based acoustic components maker AAC Technologies Holdings Inc 2018.HK slumped more than 6 percent.  South Korean electronic parts suppliers Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co Ltd 009150.KS, Apple's supplier of multi-layer ceramic capacitors, dropped more than 5 percent, while LG Innotek Co Ltd 011070.KS plunged 9.5 percent.  Apple said earlier this month it would stop giving the number of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers it sold in a quarter, a closely watched metric and a key indicator of the company\u2019s success.

It faces an uphill battle when it launches its Apple TV+ streaming service on Nov. 1 for $5 a month against rivals with deeper libraries and years of experience making hit shows.  To quickly build a subscriber base, Apple is offering a year of free service for customers who purchase most Apple devices. Several Wall Street analysts said on Monday that the company could sell as many as 200 million of its latest iPhones to existing users upgrading their old phones.  Apple TV+ - which at launch will include eight original shows, including \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d featuring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon and \u201cSee,\u201d a sci-fi drama featuring Jason Momoa - will be available in over 100 markets at launch.  The big question is whether those customers will stick around after the free trial ends.  Ahead of the announcement, analysts and investors viewed Apple, which is late to the streaming war, as facing a tough fight competing with Netflix Inc and Walt Disney Co\u2019s Disney+. Apple is also trying to win out over HBO Max with its hit shows like \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201d  Apple's offerings are dwarfed by the extensive catalog of industry leader Netflix Inc, which has a reported $10 billion budget for content and 151 million paid subscribers. tmsnrt.rs\/2N6OB2j  Walt Disney Co\u2019s Disney+ - launching Nov. 12 - has helped lift the stock almost 20% in recent months. Disney, which already controls the fast-growing streaming service Hulu, boasts a deep library of Marvel\u2019s superhero hits, the Star Wars universe, \u201cToy Story\u201d creator Pixar animation and the National Geographic channel.  Disney+ has a budget of over $1 billion for original content - a figure that will grow to around $2 billion by 2024. It is priced higher than Apple TV+, at $7 monthly or $70 annually. A bundle that includes ESPN+ and Hulu will cost $13 per month.  Media executives and analysts believe that most households are willing to pay for more than one streaming service. Many believe existing Netflix subscribers are unlikely to cancel their subscription to pay for other services. IAC Chairman Barry Diller told CNBC in July that Disney has the best chance of catching up to Netflix \u201cbecause of its very, very popular content.\u201d  Apple will not directly compete with Amazon Inc\u2019s Prime Video because that service is bundled with other perks of Prime membership - most significantly, free one- or two-day delivery on most Amazon orders.  Next spring, Apple will face another significant rival in television: HBO. The forthcoming HBO Max, from AT&T\u2019s WarnerMedia, likely priced at $16 to $17 per month, has a library of HBO, Warner Bros and other content, and is investing in original content as well.  Apple, which is spending $2 billion on original content this year, is sitting on $210.6 billion in cash. \u201cApple has the firepower to outspend a company like Disney by a wide degree,\u201d said media analyst Rich Greenfield. \u201cIf Apple makes great content, people will subscribe.\u201d  For now, Apple TV+\u2019s greatest advantage is its reach and its scale. With 1.4 billion devices worldwide, free service on most new device sales and a November launch in over 100 markets, it has the potential to do what no other service has done: be everywhere on Day One.","801":"(Repeats Aug. 14 story with no changes to text)  Aug 14 (Reuters) - \u2018Fortnite\u2019 maker Epic Games has launched the most significant effort yet to advance the legal theory that Apple\u2019s iPhone ecosystem has become so \u201csticky\u201d that it is a distinct software market over which Apple exercises monopoly power.  On Thursday Epic filed a lawsuit in federal court after Apple pulled \u201cFortnite\u201d from its App Store to punish Epic for implementing a payment mechanism that bypassed Apple\u2019s practice of taking a 30% commission on in-app purchases.  The suit seeks a court order ending Apple\u2019s commission structure and forcing Apple to allow users to install software on iPhones outside the confines of the App Store. Epic also sued Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, but the case is different because Android phones allow app installs outside its Play Store.  Epic is not the first to sue over the App Store. Consumers have filed suit alleging Apple\u2019s practices raise software prices. Developers in another suit have argued that software for iOS, the iPhone\u2019s operating system, is its own market but also made extensive alternative arguments.  Epic\u2019s lawsuit relies almost completely on the one argument that Apple\u2019s iOS app distribution and in-app payment systems are their own markets. It also goes further to argue that Apple purposely created those markets by building an \u201cecosystem\u201d of devices and services meant to favor Apple products.  \u201cA customer choosing to purchase or switch to a non-Apple device loses access to these services, leading to increased costs a customer must face when choosing to leave Apple\u2019s ecosystem,\u201d Epic wrote.  Apple on Friday declined to comment on Epic\u2019s suit.  Its primary defense in the past when confronted with allegations of anticompetitive practices is that it does not have a majority share of the global smartphone market.  \u201cApple does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business,\u201d Chief Executive Tim Cook told the U.S. House Judiciary Committee during a hearing on competition in digital markets in July.  The defense is factually accurate. iPhones and Macs have much lower global market share than Android and Windows devices, and Apple executives often say that consumers can access whatever software they desire on those competing devices or via the web browser on iPhones.  But if a federal court accepts the argument that the iOS app distribution and in-app payment markets are distinct, the implications could be profound, said John M. Newman, an associate professor at the University of Miami School of Law.  The relevant market would not be \u201capps for smartphones\u201d where Apple has a small global share compared to Android, but rather \u201capps for iPhones\u201d where Apple has much more power.  A landmark case against Microsoft Corp in the 1990s established that taking actions that make it harder for consumers to get applications from developers - even if consumers can still ultimately access the applications with extra work - could be grounds for an antitrust claim, he said.  If a court agrees that Apple controls the market for iOS app distribution, that could make Apple vulnerable to Epic\u2019s claims of illegal \u201ctying\u201d of two products together by requiring the use of Apple\u2019s in-app payment system to be allowed in the App Store.  \u201cIt sounds like the weirdest and most arcane part of the case, but it actually may be the simplest from a legal perspective,\u201d Newman said.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Judge Gonzalo Curiel of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California on Thursday ruled that Qualcomm, the world\u2019s biggest supplier of mobile phone chips, was obligated to pay nearly $1 billion in rebate payments to Apple, which for years used Qualcomm\u2019s modem chips to connect iPhones to wireless data networks.  The payments were part of a business cooperation agreement between the two companies amid the peculiar patent licensing practices of the consumer electronics industry.  In general, the contract factories that built Apple\u2019s iPhones would pay Qualcomm billions of dollars per year for the use of Qualcomm\u2019s patented technology in iPhones, a cost that Apple would reimburse the contract factories for. Separately, Qualcomm and Apple had a cooperation agreement under which Qualcomm would pay Apple a rebate on the iPhone patent payments if Apple agreed not to attack in court or with regulators.  In a lawsuit filed two years ago, Apple sued Qualcomm, alleging that the chip supplier had broken the cooperation agreement by not paying nearly $1 billion in patent royalty rebates.  Qualcomm in turn alleged that it stopped paying the rebate payments because Apple had broken the agreement by urging other smartphone makers to complain to regulators and making \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d statements to the Korean Fair Trade Commission, which was investigating Qualcomm over antitrust allegations. Apple responded that it was making lawful responses to regulators in an ongoing investigation.  Judge Curiel sided with Apple, ruling that Qualcomm owed the missed rebate payments.  \u201cQualcomm\u2019s illegal business practices are harming Apple and the entire industry,\u201d Apple said in a statement.  Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, told Reuters in a statement, \u201cAlthough the Court today did not view Apple\u2019s conduct as a breach of Apple\u2019s promises to Qualcomm in the 2013 Business Cooperation and Patent Agreement, the exposure of Apple\u2019s role in these events is a welcome development.\u201d  The decision will not become final until after the trial in the case, which begins next month. And it is unlikely that Qualcomm will make a new payment to Apple.  Apple\u2019s contract factories, which under normal circumstances would pay Qualcomm for patent royalties owed on iPhones, have already withheld the nearly $1 billion in payments to Qualcomm. Qualcomm\u2019s Rosenberg said those withheld iPhone payments have already been accounted for in Qualcomm\u2019s existing financial statements.  \u201cApple has already offset the payment at issue under the agreement against royalties that were owed to Qualcomm,\u201d Qualcomm\u2019s Rosenberg told Reuters.","804":"FILE PHOTO: The Amazon logo is pictured outside the company's JFK8 distribution center in Staten Island, New York, U.S. November 25, 2020.

The investigation is the latest by the country\u2019s regulators against the tech giant after they found last year that the company may have breached antitrust rules on the way it sold its iPhones in Japan.  It also comes as Apple may face more regulatory scrutiny in the United States. Reuters reported in June that the U.S. Justice Department has jurisdiction for a potential probe of Apple as part of a broader review of whether technology giants are using their size to act in an anti-competitive manner.  Japan\u2019s FTC survey of companies showed that Apple had signed contracts forcing firms to provide free technology and know-how to its affiliates for parts manufacturing, the Mainichi said.  It also pressured some suppliers to lower components prices and prohibited them from selling parts and technology to other companies, while requiring them to shoulder the costs of any unforeseen issues, the newspaper said, citing unnamed sources.  When a company called it an infringement of intellectual property rights and demanded a revision, Apple threatened to end their business relationship, the report said.  The FTC had no immediate comment. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Last year, the FTC investigated Apple over allegations that it unfairly pressured Yahoo Japan Corp 4689.T to slow the expansion of its online games platform, which competes with Apple's App store.  The tech firm is also facing a potential U.S. investigation over allegations that App Store policies give the company too much clout over app sales and in-app purchases.","810":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window.)  * Fed expected to hold rates, statement due at 2:00 pm ET  * Apple, Boeing boost Dow after earnings  * Starbucks slips as virus prompts store closures in China  * Indexes up: Dow 0.38%, S&P 0.29%, Nasdaq 0.34% (Updates to early afternoon)  Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes rose on Wednesday, boosted by shares of Apple, Boeing and General Electric following their results, while investors assessed the economic damage of the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak.

With interest rates expected to remain on hold, market participants are keen to know the central bank\u2019s take on adjustments to its balance sheet and the impact of China\u2019s coronavirus outbreak on global growth.  Since the Fed cut rates in October, its third and final reduction in 2019, policymakers have agreed to keep their target policy rate in the current range of 1.50% and 1.75%.  \u201cInvestors will be paying close attention to Powell\u2019s comments, where I think we could get a little bit of a surprise in the assessment of inflation,\u201d said Ryan Sweet, head of monetary policy research at Moody\u2019s Analytics.  \u201cYou could start to see the Fed put more emphasis on the inflation undershoot, which would be dovish.

As earnings gather pace, analysts expect profit for S&P 500 companies to be flat in the fourth quarter, an improvement over a 0.6% decline estimated at the start of the season, according to Refinitiv data.

Stocks, which initially gained after the Fed statement, reversed course as potential U.S. restrictions on Chinese telecommunications companies reinforced investor concerns about trade relations between the United States and China.  In its statement, the Fed expressed confidence that a recent rise in inflation to near the U.S. central bank\u2019s target would be sustained, leaving it on track to raise borrowing costs in June. It also said inflation \u201con a 12-month basis is expected to run near the Committee\u2019s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.\u201d  \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any particular news to get it going other than the Fed staying the course, and that contributed to the slide in stock prices,\u201d said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist, senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.  The Fed raised rates in March and currently forecasts another two increases this year. Ahead of the statement, some investors were nervous it might sound more hawkish on policy tightening after recent concerns about rising inflation.  The U.S. dollar fell from 2018 highs set earlier in the day after the Fed statement raised concerns that monetary accommodation will stay loose even as the central bank hikes rates. But the greenback later reversed course to trade higher.  The dollar index rose 0.3 percent, with the euro up 0.02 percent to $1.1952.

U.S. President Donald Trump is considering issuing an executive order restricting certain Chinese companies from selling telecommunications equipment in the United States.  Trade relations between the United States and China have already been strained as Trump has weighed imposing tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese imports. A Trump administration delegation is scheduled to visit Beijing on Thursday and Friday for talks with top Chinese officials.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see investors willing to take increasing risk ahead of a couple more weeks of trade discussions and negotiations to come,\u201d said Matthew Miskin, market strategist at John Hancock Investments in Boston.

Fitbit said the Versa Lite smartwatch will cost $160, down from $200 for the full version. While still tracking workouts and heart rate, it will lack some features such as the ability to store music directly on the watch.  Fitbit was the second-biggest seller of smartwatches in 2018, with 5.5 million units sold, behind Apple Inc\u2019s 22.5 million units but just ahead of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd\u2019s 5.3 million units, according to data firm Strategy Analytics.

The online store for Suning, a popular Chinese electronics vendor, offers the 64GB version of the iPhone 11 for 4999 yuan ($707.54), a discount of 500 yuan from the price listed on Apple\u2019s official China Website.  The 64GB version of the iPhone 11 Pro Max, meanwhile, sells for 7499 yuan ($1,061.38), a discount of 1600 yuan from the price on Apple\u2019s China website.  Other e-commerce vendors, including JD.com, Gome, and Dangdang, as well as several authorised Apple resellers on Tmall, the popular site run by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, offer similar price cuts.  For a time, Apple granted little leeway for its Chinese third-party sellers to lower prices.  But in early 2019, several Chinese e-commerce cites dropped prices on number of iPhone models. The cuts arrived as the company faced weak demand in China, in part because of competition from domestic rivals.  Apple\u2019s Tim Cook later said the cuts played a role in helping the company recover sales in China.  The latest round of price cuts comes as Apple prepares for the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.  In February, as the virus peaked in China, Cook warned investors that the company would not meet its revenue guidance for the coming quarter amid disruption of both the Chinese supply chain and consumer demand there.  Data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), a branch of the Chinese government, revealed that Apple shipped fewer than 500,000 phones in China that month.  Mo Jia, who tracks the global smartphone industry at research firm Canalys, said that although some smartphone brands have seen sales in China recover as the virus subsides in the country, Apple is not yet one of them.  He attributes the delayed uptake to Chinese brands\u2019 swift rollout of 5G devices, as consumers who are ready to purchase new phones want models compatible with the country\u2019s upgraded telecommunications networks.  \u201cApple only offers 4G phones and they are expensive compared to their counterparts,\u201d Jia said.","816":"Feb 14 (Reuters) -  * APPLE TO REOPEN ITS STORE IN SHANGHAI ON SATURDAY - CNBC Further company coverage:","817":"FILE PHOTO: A logo of Sharp Corp is pictured at CEATEC (Combined Exhibition of Advanced Technologies) JAPAN 2016 at the Makuhari Messe in Chiba, Japan, October 3, 2016.

The Chinese commerce ministry said the two sides will meet again in the United States in September, which the White House confirmed.  Meanwhile, market participants are expecting a quarter-percentage-point cut in borrowing costs by the U.S. central bank.

Apple charges a commission of between 15%-30% for apps that use its in-app payment system and sets out extensive rules for apps in its App Store, which is the only way Apple allows consumers to download native apps to devices such as the iPhone.

You\u2019re probably thinking it\u2019s odd for a second shareholders\u2019 firm to submit a brief opposing a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss a securities fraud class action. But here\u2019s something even more peculiar: It looks like Judge Rogers is on the verge of replacing Labaton and its client with Robbins Geller and the Norfolk fund as leaders of this case. In the final paragraph of the judge\u2019s dismissal order, she said she \u201cintends to reconsider the motion for lead counsel\u201d and directed Labaton to confer with Robbins Geller on \u201cthe orderly transition of leadership.\u201d  Yep: Robbins Geller appears, in the middle of the case, to be on the verge of assuming control of a class action in which investors allege tens of billions of dollars in losses.  Robbins Geller\u2019s Shawn Williams declined to provide a statement on this quite unusual development. Carol Villegas and Christine Fox of Labaton did not respond to my email.  Judge Rogers\u2019 reconsideration of who should lead the case did not come out of the blue. The controversy actually goes back to the very beginning of the litigation. Robbins Geller\u2019s client, the Norfolk fund, filed an initial class action complaint based on Apple\u2019s alleged misrepresentations about iPhone demand. It asserted a class period beginning on the date of Cook\u2019s call with analysts in November 2018. Labaton\u2019s client, the Rhode Island fund, filed a complaint asserting that Apple\u2019s alleged deceit dated back much farther, beginning with alleged misstatements denying that software was \u201cthrottling\u201d older iPhone models.  The Rhode Island fund lost less than $50,000 in the class period proposed by Robbins Geller\u2019s client. But the longer class period it asserted allowed the Rhode Island fund to claim losses of $4 million, making it the presumptive lead plaintiff if Judge Rogers consolidated the cases. Robbins Geller argued against consolidation, but at a hearing last August, the judge said there did not seem to be a \u201clogical way\u201d to separate the two class actions.  She also said, however, that she was skeptical of the throttling claims and the longer class period asserted by Labaton\u2019s client. The solution, Judge Rogers said, was to allow a round of briefing on a motion to dismiss. If the throttling claims ended up being dismissed, she said, she would \u201cre-evaluate the appropriateness of who is leading the class and most likely appoint Norfolk.\u201d  In her order appointing Labaton\u2019s client, the judge explicitly said that Robbins Geller\u2019s client was permitted to seek leave to file its own short brief supplementing Labaton\u2019s arguments against dismissal. That\u2019s why Robbins Geller was able to brief Apple\u2019s allegedly fraudulent intent on the November 2018 analyst call even though its client was not the lead plaintiff.  Judge Rogers\u2019 decision on Tuesday suggests she\u2019s sticking to what she said at the lead plaintiff hearing last year. She did indeed toss the throttling claims, leaving only the iPhone demand allegations to be litigated. The judge did not define a class period \u2013 this was a ruling on Apple\u2019s motion to dismiss, not a class certification decision \u2013 but it\u2019s hard to see why the class should begin before November 2018, when the alleged misstatements occurred. In that shortened class period, Robbins Geller\u2019s client experienced vastly larger losses than Labaton\u2019s.  Defining the class period is an underappreciated art form, to be sure. I think I\u2019m a pretty big securities class action nerd, and even I don\u2019t usually pay much attention to the start date proposed by lead plaintiff candidates.  But thanks to the contretemps in the Apple case, I will from now on.","827":"MELBOURNE, March 22 (Reuters) - Australian department store Myer will stop selling Apple Inc products due to the sales being unprofitable, operator Myer Holdings said on Friday.

REUTERS\/Chance Chan  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Memories of Apple nearly going bankrupt in the mid-1990s scared Steve Jobs and his colleagues. Now worth some $840 billion, it has kept an absurdly conservative balance sheet for two decades. Apple returned about $50 billion to shareholders last fiscal year through share buybacks and dividends. Yet the company, whose free cash flow more than replenishes that every year, still had over $160 billion of net cash last quarter. Doubling the payout for three years would still leave current boss Tim Cook with all the cash he needs.  U.S. tax law created another balance-sheet distortion. Overseas profit was sheltered from American taxes, and because most of Apple\u2019s cash \u2013 an eye-watering $285 billion at the end of 2017 \u2013 was held offshore, it was cheaper to borrow than repatriate it. The company has $122 billion of debt outstanding, issued largely to pay for buybacks and dividends. December\u2019s changes to corporate tax means Apple must pay $38 billion over eight years but gets access to all its cash.  Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, said during the last earnings call that Apple will eventually hold equal debt and cash on its balance sheet. Suppose the company aims to get there over three years. It should generate some $165 billion of free cash flow, after capital expenditures, over the rest of the year to September 2018 and the following two fiscal years, according to estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters.  At the $50 billion pace of buybacks and dividends seen last year, the company would shell out about $135 billion more to investors over the same period. Assume a minimal $5 billion for M&A, given Apple is famously averse to big deals \u2013 the biggest it has ever done is $3 billion for Beats in 2014. Add $14 billion of tax installments. Sum it all up, and the company would still increase its cash pile by more than $10 billion, boosting net cash above $170 billion \u2013 and that\u2019s assuming no debt repayment.  Apple needed less than $30 billion tied up in working capital at the end of 2017. That means increasing buybacks or dividends by $50 billion in each of the next three years is feasible, in theory. Debt markets are always an option, too. Investors, waiting to hear Apple\u2019s plans when it reports earnings on Tuesday, may be in for a flood of cash.","830":"May 1 (Reuters) - Apple Inc shares rose almost 5 percent on Wednesday, pushing the iPhone maker\u2019s market valuation back towards $1 trillion as its quarterly report and upbeat forecast calmed investors worried about slowing growth.  Apple breached the trillion-dollar valuation in August last year, but later gave up the gains as signs emerged of weak demand for its newest iPhones, especially in China, the world\u2019s biggest smartphone market.  The company\u2019s shares were trading around $210 in early trading after closing at $200.67 on Tuesday ahead of the quarterly report and valuing the company at around $970 billion, based on 4.6 billion shares outstanding.  That leaves it trailing Microsoft in the race to be the world\u2019s biggest company by market value, substantially because the number of Apple shares has fallen steadily as it returns billions of its profits to investors by buying back its own stock.  For comparison, the company\u2019s last regulatory filing in January showed there were more than 4.715 billion shares outstanding at the end of December.  Apple said its buybacks last year amounted to more than $70 billion, or around five times its own spending on research and development.  Apple\u2019s research budget still remains one of the world\u2019s largest, with many of its Wall Street backers pointing to the risk that the iPhone may not be as popular going forward as it has been over the past decade.  For now, while iPhone sales fell again in the second quarter, the company\u2019s services revenue beat Wall Street expectations and it forecast an upbeat third quarter.  At least six brokerages hiked their price targets on the stock, with Jefferies making the most aggressive move by raising its target by $50 to $210.  \u201cApple reported a clean March quarter and bullish June quarter outlook which against a backdrop of negative investor sentiment sets up for shares to move higher,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts said.  Analysts said iPhone demand in China was getting better as Apple cut prices, upgraded its device financing program and benefited from improved trade dialogue between the United States and China.  \u201cWith a mature smartphone market, we believe Apple has locked up strong share of the premium tier market and will continue to dominate high-end smartphones sales and capture the vast majority of smartphone profits for the next several years,\u201d Canaccord Genuity analysts said.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Apple, which has kept details of its self-driving program under wraps, put in 79,745 miles (128,337 km) of testing in California in 2018, still far short of 10 million miles of testing on roads around the world by Alphabet Inc\u2019s Waymo. But the miles put in by Apple last year far surpassed the 838 miles of testing that the iPhone maker did the previous year.  The data was part of California regulators\u2019 annual so-called \u201cdisengagement reports,\u201d which track how often a human safety driver must intervene to take control from a self-driving system during testing on public roads.  In the complex world of self-driving technology where road-test data is a closely guarded secret, the number of miles between disengagements has become a key metric for industry watchers to indicate how far any player\u2019s technology has progressed.  Waymo led the industry with 11,017 miles between disengagements in 2018, a 50 percent improvement from 5,595 miles the year before. Waymo said the improvement came despite driving 1.2 million miles in California, where roads are much busier than other areas where it is testing vehicles, such as suburban Arizona.  \u201cA lower rate of disengagements shows that our cars are getting better at recognizing and handling a wide variety of driving situations, including \u2018edge cases\u2019 across the cities we\u2019ve been testing in: those unusual situations that a human driver might see only once (or never) in a lifetime of driving,\u201d Waymo said in blog post.  Apple, by contrast, came in dead last, logging just over one mile per disengagement. In a letter to regulators, Apple said its approach to reporting disengagements had been \u201cconservative\u201d and that its report was \u201cover-inclusive.\u201d  Apple said it changed how it categorized disengagements starting in July 2018. Since then, the company said it had driven about 2,000 miles between what it calls \u201cimportant disengagements,\u201d which it defined as \u201csituations that might have resulted in a safety-related event or a violation of the rules of the road.\u201d At least two of those \u201cimportant disengagements\u201d happened when other human drivers hit its test vehicles, Apple said.  Apple declined to comment beyond its public documents, but even its re-worked disengagement numbers put it below other firms testing the technology.  General Motor\u2019s Cruise said it had driven 447,621 miles in California autonomously in 2018, with a disengagement every 5,205 miles on average, an improvement over every 1,236 miles last year. Cruise has yet to meet a target it set for early 2018 of driving 1 million miles autonomously per month.  Apple, which has only talked in general terms about its interest in self-driving, is a relative latecomer to the field, having only secured a California permit to conduct testing in 2017.  Last year Apple re-hired Doug Field to work on its self-driving car project, called Project Titan, with longtime executive Bob Mansfield. Field had previously left Apple to become senior vice president of engineering at Tesla Inc.  Some companies, including Ford Motor Co , Tesla Inc, Lyft and German auto supplier Bosch, said they had performed no autonomous testing in California last year.","833":"* Apple will miss quarterly revenue target due to coronavirus  * European stocks fall 0.5-1%, S&P500 futures down 0.4%  * Euro near three-year low after bleak German ZEW survey  * Australian dollar falls; gold, benchmark bonds gain  * Oil skids more than 2%  * HSBC tumbles 6% after profit miss, to slash 35,000 jobs  LONDON, Feb 18 (Reuters) - World stocks markets were knocked off record highs on Tuesday as two of the world\u2019s mega companies and Europe\u2019s largest economy, Germany, reported damage from the coronavirus outbreak.  Apple\u2019s stock fell almost 6% in Frankfurt at one stage and Wall Street looked set for a rocky ride later after the iPhone maker warned it was unlikely to meet the March quarter sales guidance that it had set just three weeks ago.  All of Europe\u2019s main markets were down between 0.5% and 1%. China sensitive stocks led the falls but the mood had been darkened further by a far-worse-than-feared German investor sentiment survey pointing to a deepening manufacturing recession there.  HSBC announced a massive restructuring that involved shedding $100 billion of assets and slashing 35,000 jobs over three years. It also warned about the impact of the coronavirus on its Asia business. The stock fell more than 6% in London trade.  \u201cWe have been pointing out that the market reaction in past weeks was excessively constructive and this could be a wake-up call to all investors that ignored so far potential negative impact,\u201d analysts at UniCredit said.  The warning from Apple sobered investors who had hoped stimulus from China and other countries would protect the global economy from the effects of the epidemic.  China\u2019s CSI300 bluechip stocks index had given up 0.5% after gaining sharply on Monday, encouraged by a central bank rate cut and government stimulus hopes.  HSBC ensured Hong Kong Hang Seng lost 1.5%, while the global tech reaction to Apple\u2019s warning left Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei down 1.4% and South Korea down 1.5% as Samsung slid and the Seoul government declared an economic emergency.  With safety in demand again, benchmark government bonds rallied. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell 5 basis point to just above 1.5% and yields on German Bunds hit their most negative depths in two weeks.  Commodity markets, which are worried about the virus\u2019 impact on power hungry China and other major Asian markets, saw Brent oil prices tumble over 2% after five days of gains as gold jumped the other way to a two-week high.  The safe-haven Japanese yen rose 0.15% to 109.70 yen per dollar too while the risk- and China-sensitive Australian dollar lost 0.4% to $0.6686.  The yuan was steadier, trading at 6.9950 per dollar but the euro certainly was not and looked to be heading to $1.08 after Germany\u2019s gloomy ZEW survey had bashed it down for a 10th day in the last 12.  \u201cI sense that people are increasingly worried about the real world impact on the export machine that is Germany,\u201d said Allianz Global Investors strategist Neil Dwane.  TEMPTED TO SELL  Also hurting market sentiment were a reports that U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration was considering changing regulations to allow it to block shipments of chips to China\u2019s Huawei from companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker.  S&P 500 e-mini futures were down 0.5% and Nasdaq futures fell 0.6%, but TSMC had lost 2.9% overnight.  The number of new cases of the virus in mainland China fell below 2,000 for the first time since January, but it remains far from contained. The death toll in China had climbed to 1,868, the National Health Commission said, and the World Health Organization said \u201cevery scenario is still on the table\u201d in terms of the epidemic\u2019s evolution.  As China\u2019s authorities try to prevent the spread of the disease, the economy is paying a heavy price. Some cities remain locked down, streets are deserted, and travel bans and quarantine orders are preventing migrant workers from getting back to their jobs.  Many factories have yet to re-open, disrupting supply chains in China and beyond, as highlighted by Apple.  \u201cApple is saying its recovery could be delayed, which could mean the impact of the virus may go beyond the current quarter,\u201d said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.  \u201cIf Apple shares were traded cheaply, that might not matter much. But when they are trading at a record high, investors will be surely tempted to sell.\u201d","834":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A raft of profit warnings from Apple Inc AAPL.O suppliers this week has fueled investor concerns that iPhone sales, in terms of volume, have hit a wall that could spell trouble for the company's plans to make services its main pillar of growth.  For the past year, investors had largely been willing to overlook stagnating unit sales of the iPhone because average selling prices kept rising. But it now faces fierce competition from mid-priced phones from makers such as Xiaomi Corp 1810.HK.  Apple has often stated its plan to increase its revenue from paid services, such as Apple Music and iCloud. That, at least in part, requires a growing base of device owners driven by its iPhone, which analysts believe accounts for about two-thirds of the 1.3 billion Apple devices in use around the world.  Wall Street analysts have expressed concerns that slower overall smartphone sales will make it harder for Apple to hold smartphone market share as people put off buying its generally more expensive phones. That, in turn, could hurt the growth of Apple\u2019s services revenue, said Bernstein\u2019s Toni Sacconaghi.  Without volume growth in promising overseas markets such as India, Brazil and Russia, the worry among analysts and investors is that Apple has at least parts of its strategy wrong with too much emphasis on its premium brand and the high prices that go with it, more than $1,000 for its top models.  Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said phones like the OnePlus 6T are roughly comparable to Apple\u2019s high-end phones for almost half the price. \u201cYou can get a lot of phone for a lot less,\u201d he said. \u201cThe phone landscape is rapidly changing and I think manufacturers are missing a trick by going the $1,000 route.\u201d  Apple declined to comment on its strategy, or the share moves among its suppliers.  The company\u2019s executives have warned investors in the past against fixating on sparse data points from its large supply chain. Apple has for more than a decade insisted that its gadgets should not be judged on their specs alone, an argument that sales data suggests Apple made successfully.  The company also has customer satisfaction and loyalty rates that are unparalleled in the mobile phone industry, said Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies.

REUTERS\/Edgar Su\/File Photo  Nevertheless, a trio of Chinese smartphone makers - Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo - accounted for roughly a quarter of the global market in the first half of 2018, according to data from research firm IDC, up from just 8.9 percent for all of 2014 and almost 20 percent last year.  With the exception of fiscal 2015, Apple has not increased its market share. It had 13.6 percent of the world market in the first half of this year, down from 14.8 percent for 2014, although its share typically rises with full-year results due to strong sales in December.  The 1.3 billion iPhones, iPads and Macs used around the world serves as the pool of potential customers for Apple\u2019s services - a business that hit $37.1 billion in revenue for the most recent fiscal year.  That represented 14 percent of Apple\u2019s overall revenue, up from 8.5 percent in fiscal 2015 when iPhone unit sales hit their all-time high.  But IDC expects the global smartphone market to grow only 2.4 percent on a compound basis to 1.6 billion units by 2022, indicating a saturated market in which the Cupertino, California-based firm will be fighting rivals for each customer.  Xiaomi, in particular, is gaining fans rapidly. In India, where Apple has only a minor presence, Xiaomi has in some quarters beat Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS to become the country's top phone seller and is also making headway into European markets like Spain, IDC said in a report.  According to data from IDC, Xiaomi was the top smartphone seller in India in the first and second quarters of 2018, with 30.3 percent and 29.7 percent, respectively, of the market for smartphone units there.  \u201cThis is the case where it\u2019s much different in other parts of the world,\u201d said Ryan Reith, program vice president for IDC\u2019s mobile device tracking program, noting that most U.S. consumers are not familiar with Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo phones.  \u201cMany of those brands don\u2019t play (in the United States), but they\u2019re playing in places where they never played before,\u201d such as India and Europe, he said.  SUPPLIERS SUFFER  In its latest earnings this month, Apple shocked investors with a lower-than-expected sales forecast for the holiday shopping quarter and with its announcement that it would stop reporting unit sales for its hardware products as has been customary for the last 20 years.  Underscoring flattening iPhone unit sales, it also said it sold 217.7 million iPhones in its most recent fiscal year, virtually unchanged from the year before and well below a high point of 231.2 million in fiscal 2015.  Its share price, hit at the time of the forecast, has since extended losses after profit warnings from suppliers like Japan Display Inc 6740.T, British chipmaker IQE Plc IQE.L and Lumentum Holdings Inc LITE.O. The stock is now down about 8 percent since its Nov. 1 earnings.  Apple\u2019s newest models such as the iPhone XS and iPhone XR are proving popular with its most loyal fans in wealthy economies. But they range up to $1,449 in price - out of reach for many consumers in less developed markets.  Apple\u2019s strategy is to lure those consumers to its eco-system with older models at cheaper prices.  It has also emphasized that its phones are designed to last longer than the competition, expanded its repair options and crafted its most recent operating system update to speed up older devices.  But Chinese smartphone makers have been packing their phones with higher-end chips and features like under-the-glass fingerprint sensors that seek to attract consumers who might otherwise give Apple\u2019s phones a look.  Those manufacturers are increasingly adopting Qualcomm Inc's QCOM.O most powerful mobile phone chips, said Cristiano Amon, the head of chip operations at the U.S. chipmaker, which is locked in a bitter court dispute with Apple.  Those phones were initially sold in China but \u201cwe\u2019ve also seen them gaining share outside China, especially in areas such as India and Europe,\u201d Amon said.  On its home turf, too, Apple is facing new challenges from at least one Chinese maker, OnePlus, which is creeping in to the U.S. firm\u2019s traditionally high pricing territory. Though the iPhone 7\u2019s processor chip beats the OnePlus 6T in some speed tests posted by chip tracking firm Geekbench, the OnePlus phone has a contemporary design with thin bezels around the display, similar to newer iPhone models.  After years of being available in the United States only via an online store and developing a following among tech enthusiasts, the OnePlus 6T is being carried by T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.O stores.  At $549, it sits between the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 in terms of pricing. Kyle Kiang, the general manager for North America for OnePlus, said first-day sales of the new model were 86 percent higher in the United States than for the previous OnePlus released there, although he did not disclose absolute unit figures. He said sales were higher because of the T-Mobile relationship.","835":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O denied a Bloomberg Businessweek report on Thursday that said their systems had been infiltrated by malicious computer chips inserted by Chinese intelligence agents.

Super Micro Computer shares fell 38 percent to $13.26 in Pink Sheet trading.  San Jose, California-based Super Micro strongly denied that it sold servers to customers contained malicious microchips in the motherboards of those systems. It said it has never found any malicious chips, had not been informed that such chips were found by any customer, and never been contacted by government agencies on the matter.  Bloomberg reported that Amazon uncovered the malicious chips in 2015 when examining servers manufactured by a company known as Elemental Technologies which Amazon eventually acquired.  The investigation found that Elemental servers, which were assembled by Super Micro, were tainted with tiny microchips that were not part of their design, Bloomberg said. Amazon reported the matter to U.S. authorities, who determined that the chips allowed attackers to create \u201ca stealth doorway\u201d into networks using those servers, the story said.  AWS told Bloomberg it had reviewed its records related to the Elemental acquisition and \u201cfound no evidence to support claims of malicious chips or hardware modifications.\u201d  Bloomberg also reported that Apple in 2015 found malicious chips in servers it purchased from the hardware maker, citing three unidentified company insiders.  Apple denied the account, saying it had investigated Bloomberg\u2019s claims.  Representatives with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment. A U.S. National Security Agency spokeswoman said she had no immediate comment.  While the companies disputed the facts in the story, security experts noted that there is growing concern that hackers could launch cyber attacks by inserting malicious chips into hardware sold to government agencies and businesses.  \u201cExtended, complex, global supply chains create a risk for malicious cyber activity that companies must take into account,\u201d said Michael Daniel, chief executive of the non-profit Cyber Threat Alliance.","836":"FILE PHOTO - A logo of Sharp Corp is pictured at the CEATEC JAPAN 2017 (Combined Exhibition of Advanced Technologies) at the Makuhari Messe in Chiba, Japan, October 2, 2017.

The company, a unit of Taiwan\u2019s Foxconn, flagged the weak annual profit earlier this month as the coronavirus outbreak disrupted its supply chains for display panels and other components.","837":"* Apple warns of revenue shortfall due to coronavirus * Latam stocks index hits 1-week low * Citi cuts growth forecast for Brazil (Updates prices, adds analysts' comment) By Sruthi Shankar Feb 18 (Reuters) - Latin American currencies and stocks came under pressure on Tuesday as Apple Inc's sales warning underscored fears about economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak. MSCI's index of Latin American equities fell 1% to its lowest level in one week, with stocks markets in Brazil, Chile and Argentina falling between 0.5% and 2.6%. The world's most valuable technology company said it will miss its March quarter sales guidance as the fast-spreading outbreak in China disrupted supply chains. The warning sent jitters through global financial markets which were off to an upbeat start to the week after China's stimulus efforts on Monday. \"We all know Apple's supply chain is very heavily dependent on China. It's not surprising that this is coming out,\" said Jim Besaw, chief investment officer at GenTrust. \"What's probably more relevant is what everyone thinks is going to be the evolution of the epidemic over the next several weeks which seems to be a bit of a wild card.\" A Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey showed slowing economic growth and commodities demand in China as the biggest worries among Latin American fund managers by far. Demand for safer assets boosted the dollar, weakening Brazil's real for the second session as Citigroup cut its economic growth and inflation forecasts for the country. It cited fallout from the coronavirus in China, which is Brazil's largest trading partner. Argentine bonds drifted 1% lower on the penultimate day of meetings in Buenos Aires with the International Monetary Fund, with policymakers rushing to hammer out a revamp of $44 billion in loans. The IMF mission ends on Wednesday, with a statement that Argentina hopes will not only announce a postponement of loan repayments to the fund but support for its upcoming restructuring of bonds.

The central bank is expected to hold interest rates steady, but will likely further encourage expectations that it will lift borrowing costs in June on the back of rising inflation and low unemployment.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The redesigned Apple TV app aims to solve some of the headaches that have emerged in the streaming media era. A show\u2019s past seasons, for example, might be available on Hulu, Netflix Inc or iTunes, while current episodes require cable or purchase, leaving customers juggling multiple remotes.  Available in more than 100 markets, Apple\u2019s new app pulls many of those services together to show viewers where they can watch live or on-demand movies, TV shows, news and sports via a single search, or through personalized recommendations.  Apple is following cable provider Comcast Corp and others that have taken steps to simplify modern TV watching.  More important to Apple\u2019s bottom line, the app also will allow users to sign up and pay for channels they do not already subscribe to without creating new passwords or downloading additional apps. Early partner channels include HBO, Starz, Showtime and Tastemade, with more expected to join in the future, Apple said.  Apple officials would not comment on the economics of the channels, but people familiar with the matter said Apple will take a cut of the subscription fees when customers use the Apple TV app to sign up for a channel.  Apple\u2019s sales from its services business, which also includes sales from iCloud, the App Store and other businesses, reached $11.45 billion in its most recent fiscal quarter, compared with analyst estimates of $11.32 billion, according to FactSet data.  Initially, the app will be available on Apple devices plus 2019 Samsung Electronics Co Ltd smart TVs and some 2018 models. Later this year, customers with certain Vizio, LG and Sony TVs will be able to use the TV app using AirPlay 2.  Apple\u2019s television app will also aim to let users search for a show across multiple services in one shot, including by using Siri, the company\u2019s voice assistant. The app will make recommendations based on a mix of curation by human editors and a viewer\u2019s watching habits.  There will be some limitations, however. Netflix has said it will not be included in Apple\u2019s channels, which means programming on Netflix will appear in search results but viewers will need to exit the Apple TV app. And so far only three pay TV providers are supported in the Apple TV app - Charter Communications Inc\u2019s Spectrum, AT&T Inc\u2019s DirecTV Now and Sony\u2019s Playstation Vue.  The app also will serve as the home this fall for the Apple TV+ subscription service, which will include original shows from Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey and others.","841":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Demand for safe havens rose and global equity markets turned south on Friday after Apple Inc said it would temporarily shut 11 U.S. stores as coronavirus cases continue to rise, rekindling fears of a deadly second wave of the pandemic.

But it likely will not feature the New York Times Co.  FILE PHOTO: Mark Thompson, president and CEO of the New York Times Company, poses for a portrait in New York, November 26, 2013. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  Mark Thompson, chief executive of the biggest U.S. newspaper by subscribers, warned that relying on third-party distribution can be dangerous for publishers who risk losing control over their own product.  \u201cWe tend to be quite leery about the idea of almost habituating people to find our journalism somewhere else,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re also generically worried about our journalism being scrambled in a kind of Magimix (blender) with everyone else\u2019s journalism.\u201d  Thompson, who took over as New York Times CEO in 2012 and has overseen a massive expansion in its online readership, warned publishers that they may suffer the same fate as television and film makers in the face of Netflix\u2019s Hollywood insurgence.  \u201cIf I was an American broadcast network, I would have thought twice about giving all of my library to Netflix,\u201d Thompson said in response to questions about any talks with Apple to participate in the iPhone maker\u2019s new news service.  Thompson declined to comment on any conversations with Apple. But he used the tale of how Netflix made huge inroads into Hollywood to explain why the Times has avoided striking deals with digital platforms in which it had little control over relationships with customers or its content.  \u201cEven if Netflix offered you quite a lot of money. ... Does it really make sense to help Netflix build a gigantic base of subscribers to the point where they could actually spend $9 billion a year making their own content and will pay me less and less for my library?\u201d he asked.  In 2007 the answer for Hollywood was yes. In exchange for billions of dollars, studios helped Netflix launch a fledgling streaming video service by licensing their libraries of shows and movies, but that decision may have sown the seeds of their own demise.  By 2016, Time Warner Inc was forced to sell itself to AT&T Inc and Rupert Murdoch sold his 21st Century Fox film and TV studios to Walt Disney Co.  Apple is the latest company to offer a direct-to-consumer streaming video, along with a news subscription service, by leveraging the power of its more than 1 billion devices.  Through its subscription news service, Apple will charge about $10 monthly for access to a variety of magazine and newspaper content, according to media reports. Apple is expected to take 50 percent of the revenue. The Wall Street Journal has agreed to join Apple\u2019s service, according to a recent New York Times report. News Corp, owner of the Journal, was not immediately reachable for comment.  A monthly digital subscription to the New York Times costs $15, and Thompson said he has no plans to give that up to participate on other platforms such as Apple\u2019s.  Last year, the Times generated over $700 million in digital revenue, close to the company\u2019s target of $800 million in annual digital sales by 2020. Digital ad revenue surpassed print ad revenue for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Times has plowed investment back into its newsroom, which at 1,550 journalists is now at its largest ever.  Despite the company\u2019s insistence on keeping readers on its own products and platforms, Thompson said it has experimented on other services, highlighting content the Times developed just for Snap Inc\u2019s Snapchat app, which helped reach new, younger readers.  These new audiences, he said, will play a big role in helping the Times reach its new target of 10 million subscribers by 2025.","843":"(Reuters) - The plunge in Apple Inc\u2019s share price will likely cause new pain for Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, after the conglomerate suffered a big quarterly decline in its net worth that will hit its bottom line.

(GRAPHIC: Apple cuts sales forecasts - tmsnrt.rs\/2SATVKo)  The decline in Berkshire shares reflects Apple\u2019s impact on the Omaha, Nebraska-based company\u2019s book value, which measures assets minus liabilities and which Buffett uses to gauge growth.  Thursday\u2019s decline followed a fourth-quarter slump in stock prices that may have cost Berkshire 8.2 percent of its book value, according to Keefe Bruyette & Woods analyst Meyer Shields.  Much of Berkshire\u2019s roughly $219 billion of equities as of Sept. 30, including Kraft Heinz Co, suffered double-digit declines in the quarter, when the S&P 500 including dividends fell 13.5 percent.

Buffett\u2019s assistant did not respond to an email concerning whether the billionaire\u2019s view of Apple has changed.  Many investors consider Apple a technology stock, a sector Buffett normally shuns.  But he views it more as a consumer stock, reflecting the dependence of so many people on their iPhones, and said at Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting last May he would \u201clove to see Apple go down in price\u201d so he could buy more.  The slide in book value could push Berkshire to a fourth-quarter net loss, even if its dozens of operating businesses perform well.  This is because a new accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized investment losses with quarterly results. Buffett wants investors to ignore the resulting swings.  Thomas Russo, who helps invest more than $10 billion at Gardner, Russo & Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and whose largest investment is Berkshire, said investors should focus on the value of Berkshire\u2019s operating units.  \u201cThe willingness of Berkshire investors to hold shares based on the company\u2019s intrinsic value has always been a strong suit for Warren,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is being tested by the new accounting requirements.\u201d  Berkshire\u2019s businesses were a cushion during the global financial crisis in 2008, when book value per share fell just 9.6 percent.

Shazam identifies songs when a smartphone is pointed at an audio source.  The European Commission opened a full-scale investigation into the deal in April, emblematic of its recent worries that companies may buy a data-rich rival to mine it for information or drive others out of the market.

The rulings name Apple Inc\u2019s watch, several Fitbit Inc activity trackers and connected speakers from Sonos Inc. While consumer technology\u2019s biggest sellers such as mobile phones and laptops so far have faced little danger of import duties, the rulings show that gadget makers are unlikely to be spared altogether and may have to consider price hikes on products that millions of consumers use every day.  The devices have all been determined by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials to fall under an obscure subheading of data transmission machines in the sprawling list of U.S. tariff codes. And that particular subheading is included in the more than 6,000 such codes in President Donald Trump\u2019s most recent round of proposed tariffs released earlier this month.  That $200 billion list of tariffs is in a public comment period. But if the list goes into effect this fall, the products from Apple, Fitbit and Sonos could face a 10 percent tariff.  The specific products listed in customs rulings are the original Apple Watch; Fitbit\u2019s Charge, Charge HR and Surge models; and Sonos\u2019s Play:3, Play:5 and SUB speakers.  All three companies declined to comment on the proposed tariff list. But in its filing earlier this month to become a publicly traded company, Sonos said that \u201cthe imposition of tariffs and other trade barriers, as well as retaliatory trade measures, could require us to raise the prices of our products and harm our sales.\u201d  The New York Times has reported that Trump told Apple CEO Tim Cook during a meeting in May that the U.S. government would not levy tariffs on iPhones assembled in China, citing a person familiar with the meeting.  \u201cThe way the president has been using his trade authority, you have direct examples of him using his authority to target specific products and companies,\u201d said Sage Chandler, vice president for international trade policy at the Consumer Technology Association.  The toll from tariffs on the gadget world\u2019s smaller product lines could be significant. Sonos and Fitbit do not break out individual product sales, but collectively they had $2.6 billion in revenue last year. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimates that the Apple Watch alone will bring in $9.9 billion in sales this year, though that estimate includes sales outside the United States that the tariff would not touch.  It is possible that the products from Apple, Fitbit and Sonos no longer fall under tariff codes in the $200 billion list, trade experts said. The codes applied to specific products are only public knowledge because their makers asked regulators to rule on their proper classification. And some of the products have been replaced by newer models that could be classified differently.  But if companies have products whose tariff codes are on the list, they have three options, experts said: Advocate to get the code dropped from the list during the public comment period, apply for an exclusion once tariffs go into effect, or try to have their products classified under a different code not on the list.  The last option could prove difficult due to the thousands of codes covered, said one former U.S. trade official.

The bug, which also exists on iPads, was discovered by Zuk Avraham, chief executive of San Francisco-based mobile security forensics company ZecOps, while investigating a sophisticated cyberattack against a client in late 2019. Avraham said he found evidence the vulnerability was exploited in at least six cybersecurity break-ins.  An Apple spokesman acknowledged that a vulnerability exists in Apple\u2019s software for email on iPhones and iPads, known as the Mail app, and that the company had developed a fix, which will be rolled out in a forthcoming update on millions of devices it has sold globally.  Apple declined to comment on Avraham\u2019s research, which was published on Wednesday, that suggests the flaw could be triggered from afar and that it had already been exploited by hackers against high-profile users.  Avraham said he found evidence that a malicious program was taking advantage of the vulnerability in Apple\u2019s iOS mobile operating system as far back as January 2018. He could not determine who the hackers were and Reuters was unable to independently verify his claim.  To execute the hack, Avraham said victims would be sent an apparently blank email message through the Mail app forcing a crash and reset. The crash opened the door for hackers to steal other data on the device, such as photos and contact details.  ZecOps claims the vulnerability allowed hackers to remotely steal data off iPhones even if they were running recent versions of iOS. By itself, the flaw would given access to whatever the Mail app had access to, including confidential messages.  Avraham, a former Israeli Defense Force security researcher, said he suspected that the hacking technique was part of a chain of malicious programs, the rest undiscovered, which could have given an attacker full remote access. Apple declined to comment on that prospect.  Avraham based most of his conclusions on data from \u201ccrash reports,\u201d which are generated when programs fail in mid-task on a device. He was then able to recreate a technique that caused the controlled crashes.  Two independent security researchers who reviewed ZecOps\u2019 discovery found the evidence credible, but said they had not yet fully recreated its findings due to time constraints.  Patrick Wardle, an Apple security expert and former researcher for the U.S. National Security Agency, said the discovery \u201cconfirms what has always been somewhat of a rather badly kept secret: that well-resourced adversaries can remotely and silently infect fully patched iOS devices.\u201d  Because Apple was not aware of the software bug until recently, it could have been very valuable to governments and contractors offering hacking services. Exploit programs that work without warning against an up-to-date phone can be worth more than $1 million.  While Apple is largely viewed within the cybersecurity industry as having a high standard for digital security, any successful hacking technique against the iPhone could affect millions due to the device\u2019s global popularity. In 2019, Apple said there were about 900 million iPhones in active use.  Bill Marczak, a security researcher with Citizen Lab, a Canada-based academic security research group, called the vulnerability discovery \u201cscary.\u201d  \u201cA lot of times, you can take comfort from the fact that hacking is preventable,\u201d said Marczak. \u201cWith this bug, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve got a PhD in cybersecurity, this will eat your lunch.\u201d (Reporting by Christopher Bing in Washingtong and Joseph Menn in San Francisco.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Apple said the program, which should help ease heavy demand on Apple and its authorized partners to fix millions of cracked screens and fried charging ports, will launch in the United States before being rolled out to other countries.  The back flip means that independent repair shops will be offered official parts for out-of-warranty repairs at the same price offered to authorized service providers, such as Best Buy Inc BBY.N, which perform warranty work.  Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, said the move could create more opportunities for Apple to sell services or accessories if it encourages iPhone owners to hand down used phones to friends and family.  \u201cThat helps them get the product more affordably into the hands of more customers and increases the base,\u201d Bajarin said. \u201cEvery data point seems to say, if you get someone into the Apple ecosystem, they generally don\u2019t leave.\u201d  Apple\u2019s iPhone sales have declined in the past two fiscal quarters, but sales of accessories such as its AirPods wireless headphones and the Apple Watch, along with paid services like Apple Music, have helped make up for some of the revenue falls.  Independent shops have long complained that the high purchase volumes required by Apple to become an authorized service provider priced them out of the repair market.  The tech giant had previously lobbied against \u201cright-to-repair\u201d bills to supply independent businesses in several U.S. states, including New York and California, citing concerns about maintaining a high service standard. It earlier this year allowed all U.S. Best Buy stores to handle warranty work.  However, the unofficial repair industry that sprang up, using mostly aftermarket parts supplied by third parties, was sometimes unreliable.  The change only applies to iPhones, leaving out Mac laptops, whose troubled keyboards have required extensive repairs and prompted Apple to launch a special service program. And shops cannot resell parts to customers who want to do their own work.  Kyle Wiens, chief executive of repair guide company iFixit and a longtime advocate for right-to-repair laws, said \u201cthose are all reasons that right-to-repair legislation is still really necessary.\u201d  \u201cThis is Apple realizing that the market for repair is larger than Apple could ever handle themselves, and providing independent technicians with genuine parts is a great step,\u201d Wiens said. But, he said, \u201cwhat this clearly shows is that if right-to-repair legislation passed tomorrow, Apple could instantly comply.\u201d  Apple said it tested the new repair program for a year with 20 businesses across North America, Europe and Asia. It did not give a timetable for the international launches.  The program will allow independent stores to set their own prices for repairs and also offer cheaper aftermarket parts. They will be required to return any collected broken Apple parts to the company for refurbishment or recycling.  The program will be free for shops to join, but they will be required to have an Apple-certified technician who has taken a free 40-hour training course and test provided by the company.","851":"FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc. store is seen on the day of the new iPhone 7 smartphone launch in Los Angeles, California, U.S., September 16, 2016.

Apple has long hinted at a planned video service, spending $2 billion in Hollywood to produce its own content and signing major stars such as Oprah Winfrey. The TV service is expected to launch globally, a person familiar with the matter said, an ambitious move to rival services from Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Prime Video. Apple\u2019s App Store, where the service is likely to be distributed, is currently available in more than 100 countries.  But it has kept its precise plans for how it will distribute those shows a secret, even as investors have started to fixate on revenue from paid subscriptions as a replacement for growth from iPhone sales, which declined over the holiday shopping quarter for the first time ever last year.  Apple aims to bring together its own shows into one central location with content from media companies, saving iPhone and other Apple device users from having to juggle multiple apps for those channels, the sources said. Apple is aiming to resell TV channels subscriptions similar to Amazon, whose Prime Video Service resells Starz and other channels and keeps a cut of the sales.  Apple is also in discussions with HBO, part of AT&T Inc-owned WarnerMedia, to become part of the service and it could yet make it in time for the launch, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The terms of Apple\u2019s deals could not be learned. Apple has typically sought a cut of between 30 percent for apps in the App Store to 15 percent for premium channel apps such as HBO.  Apple, CBS, HBO, Starz and Viacom declined to comment. CNBC earlier reported Apple was targeting an April or May launch for its service.  The television services launch comes as Apple builds out its services segment, which brought in $37.1 billion in its fiscal 2018.  The Wall Street Journal this week reported that major publishers such as the New York Times and Washington Post balked at the proposed terms of a possible paid news service from Apple in which the iPhone maker would keep as much as half of subscription revenues. An announcement for the news service is expected in March, Buzzfeed reported.","852":"FILE PHOTO: Workers set up a Samsung display in the lobby of the Las Vegas Convention Center in preparation for the 2020 CES in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. January 5, 2020.

REUTERS\/Charles Platiau\/File Photo  But Cook said it was impossible to forecast overall results for the current quarter because of uncertainty created by the virus. Shares declined 2.4% to $286.56 in extended trading.  With its global brand, few American companies have been exposed to the spread of the coronavirus like Apple, whose iPhone sales declined in the March quarter as device sales were forced to online-only in many places. Sales of subscription services such as streaming television content rose with billions of people locked in their homes, which pushed the overall number of subscribers to paid apps and services on Apple\u2019s devices to 515 million.  China, where the virus was first detected, is both a major market for Apple, supplying about a sixth of its overall sales, and is also home to most of Apple\u2019s contract factories.  Apple saw China sales of $9.46 billion, down less than a $1 billion from a year ago, a potential sign of how the company will fare as other markets emerge from lockdowns.  Apple slowly reopened Chinese stores, with all running again by mid-March. \u201cAs compared to February, we saw a nice improvement in March and a further improvement in April. China is headed in the right direction,\u201d Cook told Reuters in an interview.  Apple reported overall sales of $58.3 billion and earnings of $2.55 per share for its fiscal second quarter ended in March, above year-ago results of $58 billion and $2.46, and above analyst estimates of $54.5 billion and $2.27, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Cook said the first five weeks of the fiscal second quarter, \u201cit was an incredible time where we were growing very fast and we were set to essentially come in at the high end of our guidance\u201d of between $63 billion and $67 billion in sales.  But the quarter changed quickly, and Apple broke with its usual practice of providing an estimated range of sales for the current quarter.  \u201cRather than pretend we can project it, we\u2019re being very straightforward and saying we lack the visibility to do it,\u201d Cook told Reuters.  Apple stores outside mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea remained shuttered. In an interview with Bloomberg Television, Cook said that Apple plans to reopen retail stores in Austria and Australia in one to two weeks and a small number of stores in the United States in the first half of May.  Lockdowns forced Apple to release its newest iPhone SE 2 mostly via online sales. Cook said that he was pleased with early sales of the new device, along with new Macs and iPads released during the fiscal second quarter. \u201cAs compared to the last part of March and the beginning of April, we\u2019ve seen a better second half of April,\u201d Cook told Reuters.  Cook declined to comment on whether Apple faces supply chain disruptions for devices that will be released later this year. He said Apple\u2019s supply chain was \u201cback up and running at full-throttle at the end of March.\u201d  Apple on Thursday also said it would buy back another $50 billion of its own stock, a smaller figure than in past updates to its capital return program, but \u201cwe expect them to use those funds aggressively,\u201d said Brian Pirri, a principal at Apple shareholder New England Investment and Retirement Group. \u201cThey also managed to do all of this with only a $14.3 billion drawdown on their cash holdings, which still sit at a whopping $192.8 billion.\u201d  Apple said iPhone sales were $29.0 billion, down from $30.9 billion the year before compared with analyst estimates of $28.4 billion, to data from FactSet.  Sales for Apple\u2019s services segment, which includes iCloud storage as well as its streaming services for music and television shows, were $13.4 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $12.9 billion, according to FactSet data. Cook said Apple had 515 million subscribers to apps and services on Apple\u2019s platform, up by 125 million from one year earlier. Cook said during a conference call with analysts that Apple News reached 125 million monthly active users, up from 100 million in January.  \u201cThe group was quiet on AppleTV+, and we wonder how many subscribers were added in the quarter, especially following updates from rivals like Netflix and Disney+,\u201d said Sophie Lund-Yates, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O on Wednesday published four new papers outlining technical details of how some of the privacy features in its most recent operating systems work.  The white papers are similar to a security guide that Apple publishes for the iOS operating system that powers iPhones. They cover Apple's photo app, its Safari web browser, the location-based services on its mobile devices and a new service for signing into third-party apps introduced this year that competes with similar services from Facebook Inc FB.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google.  Apple does not make public the code for its operating systems or software, so privacy and security researchers use the descriptions it publishes to understand how those systems work.  In the papers, Apple outlines how its new sign-in system tries to prevent the creation of fake accounts in apps, a problem for nearly all app developers that has taken on new importance with the advent of bots on social networks.  The company uses machine-learning technology that analyzes whether the device user engages in \u201cordinary, everyday behavior such as moving from place to place, sending messages, receiving emails, or taking photos,\u201d Apple said.  That yields a numerical score that Apple combines with data from its servers to produce an assessment sent to the developer of whether the account creator is a real user.  Apple also outlined steps it has taken to cut off app developers that circumvent its rules. For example, even when users have turned off location-based services that use an iPhone\u2019s GPS chips, app developers can scan for nearby Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth devices to approximate the user\u2019s location. Developers now must ask permission for Bluetooth access, for example, and explain why it is needed, Apple\u2019s guides said.  The company has sought to market its technical approach to privacy as being significantly different to those of its rivals. It has both implicitly and explicitly criticized competitors Google and Facebook, both of which rely on data gathered from users to fuel advertising businesses.  Leaders at both rivals have said that they take steps to protect user data while using it to help keep their services free or low-cost for billions of people.

The announcement follows lawsuits last month by \u201cFortnite\u201d video game maker Epic Games accusing Google and Apple Inc of anticompetitive conduct by requiring that their payment systems be used in apps, so that they can collect a portion of sales.

Google said under 3% of developers with apps on its Play store sold digital goods over the last 12 months, and nearly 97% comply with its payment system policy.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Apple is seen at a store in Zurich, Switzerland January 3, 2019. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann -\/File Photo  But Goldman is entering a crowded market for co-branded cards where retailers often have the upper hand, and analysts question how much tolerance its shareholders will have for growing the bank\u2019s fledgling consumer business through credit card lending.  Goldman has been courting consumers since the 2016 launch of its online bank Marcus, and with its first credit card it is targeting fee-conscious ones. There will be no annual or late fees, and customers will pay variable annual interest rates of between 13.24 percent and 24.24 percent, according to Apple\u2019s website.  Apple and Goldman did not disclose the economic terms of their partnership when it was announced on Monday.  But banks have been increasingly willing to take less favorable deals because post-financial crisis regulations make the credit card business attractive for lenders, which are required to hold less capital against such debt than against other assets.  \u201cAs this kind of benign credit environment continues retailers have a greater leverage than they had a few years ago,\u201d said a person involved in similar credit card deals.  Issuing banks retain control of approving customers for cards, often using data the retailer has on shoppers as part of the process, the person said.  Goldman Chief Executive David Solomon said in an email to employees on Monday that the card is a \u201cmajor step\u201d in the bank\u2019s plan to grow its consumer business.  Solomon has said the consumer business is a critical part of the bank\u2019s strategy to grow revenues and cut costs, as revenue shrinks in traditional areas of strength for Goldman like bond trading.  But many investors have been uneasy with Goldman growing its unsecured consumer debt, especially at a time when many speculate that a recession could be looming, said UBS analyst Brennan Hawken.  Marcus now has $45 billion in customer deposits in the United States and the U.K., and has issued $5 billion in personal loans, according to Solomon\u2019s email.  While the amount of loans is small compared to the bank\u2019s overall balance sheet, Hawken said investors would likely prefer Goldman stick to using its consumer business to add deposits, as opposed to personal loans or credit card debt.  \u201cPeople want Goldman to be Goldman,\u201d Hawken said. Goldman declined comment for this article.  The Apple Card\u2019s wide interest rate range indicates that some customers might have lower credit scores, said Josh Siegel, chief executive of StoneCastle Financial Corp. However, the bank may not necessarily keep that risk on its books.  \u201cThey might securitize the debt, which wouldn\u2019t be anything new for an investment bank,\u201d Siegel said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that Goldman Sachs, all of a sudden, especially with where we are in the credit cycle, is going to go long on unsecured consumer debt.\u201d  As this is Goldman\u2019s first foray into credit cards, it may take the bank a year or two to assess the quality of its credit decisions, according to an industry expert who declined to be named.  The same person said that the stated range of possible interest rates on unpaid balances was too wide to clearly show how much credit risk Goldman expects to take.  Credit risk concerns aside, analysts said that Goldman\u2019s decision to launch its first credit card in partnership with one of the world\u2019s biggest companies gives it the opportunity to gain consumer market share.  While Apple says its card is \u201ccreated by Apple, not a bank,\u201d according to its website, the Goldman Sachs logo will appear on the back of the card.  \u201cFor Goldman this is a play for massive distribution without having to contort too much,\u201d said Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy and partner at Autonomous Research.  \u201cIt makes their brand way better at least in the retail and mass affluent marketplace.\u201d","866":"* U.S. plans on 25 pct tariffs, higher than previous plan  * Dow futures down 0.11 pct; Boeing, Caterpillar fall  * S&P futures flat, Nasdaq futures up 0.23 pct  * Apple set for record high after strong Q3 results  * Fed seen keeping rates unchanged  * Akamai drops after Q3 revenue forecast disappoints (Adds comment, details; Updates prices)  By Amy Caren Daniel  Aug 1 (Reuters) - Dow futures dipped on Wednesday due to fears that the trade war between the United States and China was escalating, while Nasdaq futures got a lift from Apple\u2019s stellar results that helped ease concerns over the future growth of the tech sector.  The Trump administration plans to propose tariffs of 25 percent, instead of the initially proposed 10 percent, on $200 billion worth of imported Chinese goods. Beijing vowed to retaliate if the United States slapped further tariffs.  Shares of trade-sensitive companies fell. Boeing and Caterpillar both declined 0.6 percent in premarket trading.  \u201cThere is a big additional tariff that is being weighed and could be put into place at any moment, which is a concern,\u201d said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin.  Apple jumped 4.1 percent to $198.17, an all-time high, after posting quarterly results that far exceeded Wall Street targets, helped by its pricey iPhone X, and forecasting revenue above expectations for the fall.  The results come as disappointing reports from companies such as Facebook and Netflix \u2014 part of the so-called FAANG group stocks \u2014 have fanned worries over the growth of high-flying technology companies.  \u201cApple stock move and its results will be positive, but whether that is a long-lasting effect on the tech sector is a question that cannot be answered,\u201d Frederick said.  FAANG members Facebook, Netflix, Amazon.com and Google-parent Alphabet were trading up between 0.10 percent and 1.3 percent.  At 8:40 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 29 points, or 0.11 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were down 0.25 points, or 0.01 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 17 points, or 0.23 percent.  Oil prices fell nearly 2 percent, weighing on energy companies, due to an industry report that U.S. crude stockpiles rose unexpectedly and on higher OPEC production.  Of the 301 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far, 81 percent of them have topped profit estimates \u2013 so far the highest beat rate on record, dating back to 1994, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Among stocks, Akamai Technologies dropped 4.8 percent after its forecast for third-quarter revenue largely missed expectations.  Sprint gained 2 percent after the wireless carrier\u2019s quarterly profit topped analysts\u2019 estimates, helped by a surprise growth in wireless subscribers.  Campbell Soup was up 3.3 percent. Reuters reported activist hedge fund Third Point is meeting with some large shareholders to seek support for changes at the company.  Also in focus is the Federal Reserve, which is expected to keep interest rates unchanged in an announcement at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT) at the end of its meeting. The market expects another two rate hikes this year.

European markets were expected to follow, with bookmakers predicting London\u2019s FTSE and Frankfurt\u2019s DAX would open 0.4 percent lower and Paris\u2019 CAC40 down 0.6 percent.  Apple blamed fewer iPhone upgrades and slowing sales in China in its most recent quarter, its first such warning since 2007. Its shares tumbled in after-hours trade.  The news sparked a \u2018flash crash\u2019 in holiday-thinned currency markets as investors rushed to less risky assets, with the Japanese yen soaring against most major currencies in a matter of seconds.  U.S. stock futures pointed to another rough start on Wall Street, with Nasdaq E-mini futures down 2.6 percent and S&P 500 E-mini futures off 1.6 percent.  MSCI\u2019s broadest gauge of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.6 percent after an early attempt at a bounce. Japanese markets were closed for holidays but Nikkei futures dropped 2.2 percent.  Shares in China and Hong Kong see-sawed between gains and losses as investors waited for Beijing to roll out fresh support measures for the cooling Chinese economy.  \u201cChinese authorities have got the luxury of having control not just of the fiscal parts of the government tool case, but also the monetary parts ... and I suspect the Chinese authorities will use that,\u201d said Jim McCafferty, head of equity research, Asia ex-Japan at Nomura.  China\u2019s central bank said late on Wednesday it was adjusting policy to benefit more small firms that are having trouble obtaining financing, in its latest move to ease strains on the private sector, a key job creator.  While more fiscal and monetary policy support had been expected in coming months on top of modest measures last year, some analysts wonder if more forceful stimulus will be needed to stabilise the world\u2019s second-largest economy.  \u201cDespite a more pro-growth policy stance, effectively since mid-2018, we expect growth to continue to slow in the foreseeable future as it appears to us that the government\u2019s policy is still behind the curve,\u201d economists at BofA Merrill Lynch said in a global research repport.  \u201cIn our view, the next significant stimulus may only occur when the government senses that financial stability is in jeopardy.\u201d  Apple\u2019s surprise announcement weighed on tech shares across Asia, most notably in Taiwan and South Korea. An MSCI index of Korean shares lost 1.8 percent and Taiwan shares fell 1.4 percent.  Australia bucked the trend, with the ASX 200 bouncing 1.4 percent after the previous day\u2019s drubbing. A sudden slide in the Aussie dollar, which fell to near decade lows at one point, boosted shares of miners and other resource exporters despite the weakening China demand outlook.  The volatile day for Asia followed swings on Wall Street overnight, where shares slid in early trade on growth worries before clawing back losses as surging oil prices drove gains in energy shares.  Apple specifically highlighted slowing Chinese growth and Sino-U.S. trade tensions, exacerbating investors\u2019 concerns about the health of the global economy.  \u201cThe fall in the EM manufacturing PMI last month was fairly broad-based and supports our view that growth in the emerging world as a whole will slow this year,\u201d Gabriella Dickens, an economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.  Adding to the sour mood, a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and congressional leaders produced no agreement to end a partial government shutdown.  Trump\u2019s demand for $5 billion in funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border triggered the shutdown affecting about a quarter of the federal government and 800,000 federal workers.  \u2018FLASH CRASH\u2019  Currency markets saw a wild spike in volatility in early Asian trade, with risk aversion pushing the yen sharply higher against the U.S. dollar, breaking key technical levels and triggering stop-loss sales of U.S. and Australian dollars.  The dollar was last 1.9 percent weaker against the yen at 106.85, having earlier fallen as low as 104.96, its lowest level since March 2018. The Australian dollar at one point hit levels against the Japanese yen not seen since 2011.  The euro was up 0.2 percent, buying $1.1365, and the dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of major rivals, was 0.3 percent weaker at 96.504.  Amid the flight to perceived safety, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 2.6328 percent compared with its U.S. close of 2.661 percent on Wednesday.  The two-year yield, was at 2.4777 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.504 percent as signs of slowing growth ate away at expectations of further Federal Reserve rate hikes.  U.S. crude fell 2.1 percent to $45.57 a barrel, and Brent crude was down 1.2 percent at $54.24. Slowing global growth is expected to coincide with an increase in crude supply, depressing prices.  Gold was higher as the dollar weakened, with spot gold trading up 0.5 percent at $1,290.91 per ounce.","869":"WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Apple Inc and other technology companies must cooperate with U.S. investigators, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday, a day after President Donald Trump lashed out at Apple for refusing to unlock phones in criminal investigations.  \u201cIt is absolutely critical for our technology companies to cooperate with law enforcement,\u201d Mnuchin told CNBC in an interview.

Apple\u2019s shares sank 8.5 percent before the opening bell after the company slashed its holiday-quarter revenue forecast on slowing iPhone sales in China, the first major warning with the U.S. earnings season around the corner.  \u201cApple reiterates worries that China and trade issues have not been resolved,\u201d said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist, senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.  \u201cPeople are worried that if a big name such as Apple has to report a decline in earnings, who else can be protected from something like that.\u201d  The warning from Apple, whose stock is a member of all the three major Wall Street indexes, rocked financial markets, as investors sought safety in bonds and less risky assets.  At 8:47 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 256 points, or 1.10 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were down 25.5 points, or 1.02 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 110.5 points, or 1.73 percent.  Apple\u2019s slide is a gloomy omen for Wall Street bulls hoping for an early gift in 2019 following December\u2019s steep selloff.  Though the selloff has made stocks cheaper, with the S&P 500\u2019s valuation now at 14 times expected earnings from 18 times a year earlier, earnings estimates have also been sharply cut.  Analysts on average expect S&P 500 companies to increase their earnings per share by nearly 7 percent this year, down from a forecast of 10 percent at the start of October and far below their expectations of 24 percent EPS growth for 2018, according to Refinitiv\u2019s IBES.  Apple\u2019s warning on China has the potential to weigh heavily on a wide variety of companies, ranging from its suppliers to firms that rely on China for a major portion of their sales.  Chipmakers, which count both Apple and China as major customers, led the decliners in premarket trading, with Intel Corp, Micron Technology Inc and Nvidia Corp falling between 1.9 percent and 3.3 percent.  Trade bellwethers Boeing Co and Caterpillar Inc dropped over 1.5 percent.  Apple\u2019s warning follows data earlier this week that showed a deceleration in factory activity in China and the euro zone, indicating the ongoing trade dispute was taking a toll on global manufacturing.  The impact on U.S. activity will be clear later in the day. The Institute of Supply Management is expected to report its index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 57.9 in December from 59.3 in November.  However, U.S. futures pared some losses after the ADP National Employment Report showed private sector jobs rose far more than expected in December.  Among other stocks, Celgene Corp jumped 33.7 percent after Bristol-Myers Squibb Co offered to buy the drugmaker for about $74 billion in a cash-and-stock deal. Bristol-Myers fell 9 percent.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Beijing said last month that it would cut taxes and fees for all companies by nearly 2 trillion yuan in 2019, with the manufacturing, transportation and construction sectors set to benefit as it looks to stimulate a slowing economy.  Price tags for products listed on Apple\u2019s China website were lowered on Monday, including a discount of up to 500 yuan ($74.44) for some of its latest iPhone models.  Apple declined to comment on its prices.  But French luxury goods group Kering said on Tuesday that its Italian Gucci brand had cut prices by 3 percent, while a spokeswoman for LVMH\u2019s Louis Vuitton confirmed its China business had adjusted prices on Friday.  Louis Vuitton was \u201cfully supportive of the Chinese government\u2019s ongoing efforts to narrow the price gap between China and overseas,\u201d she said.  Birkin-bag maker Hermes also said it had passed on the VAT cuts to customers in China, with price drops of 3 percent from the beginning of April.  Luxury brands have in recent years gradually narrowed the price gap between Europe and China - where their wares could often be 50 percent more expensive - including following a cut in import taxes brought in by the Chinese government last year.  The latest price moves follow carmakers BMW and Daimler\u2019s Mercedes-Benz which both said last month that prices for several car models would drop following the Chinese tax changes.  Several Chinese electronics retailers lowered prices for iPhones in January, discounting latest models by up to $118, after weaker-than-expected sales at end-2018.  The world\u2019s second-largest economy is growing at its weakest pace in almost three decades amid lower domestic demand and a trade war with the United States.  High-end fashion and handbag brands are increasingly looking to woo Chinese clients on their home turf, even though most of the spending by these consumers still takes place in the shopping capitals like Paris, Milan or Hong Kong.  \u201cLong term, luxury consumption will happen incrementally at home,\u201d analysts at HSBC said in a note on Tuesday. \u201cA few years ago, 75 percent of Chinese luxury sales happened outside of China.

But early last year, Apple sued Qualcomm in federal court in San Diego, alleging that the chip company\u2019s practice of taking a cut of the selling price of phones as a patent license fee was illegal.  Qualcomm denied the claims and has alleged that Apple owes it $7 billion in unpaid royalties.

Qualcomm is also trying to settle an antitrust lawsuit brought against it by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission days before Apple filed its lawsuit.  But that effort suffered a setback on Tuesday, when a federal judge in San Jose, California, issued a preliminary ruling saying that Qualcomm must license some patents involved in making modem chips to rivals such as Intel Corp INTC.O, a move that could jeopardize Qualcomm's existing licensing practices.","878":"April 24 (Reuters) - ams AG:  says major consumer customer is deemphasizing current generation of its products in favour of next generation  says unnamed big consumer customer is preparing major ramp-ups in h2 2018 for its optical sensors  says q2 factory under-utlilisation to reverse in h2 with large volume ramps; analysts say delay tied to Apple winding down first generation iPhone x in favour of new models  says q2 weakness also tied to delay in pre-production of new parts as major customer has been slow to provide it with final product specifications  says whether margins rebound in q2 or q3 entirely dependent on when customer (which analysts says is Apple) releases new product plans; exact timing remains unknown, it says Further company coverage: (Reporting By Eric Auchard in London and Francois Murphy in Vienna)","879":"FILE PHOTO: U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp's logo is seen on their \"smart building\" in Petah Tikva, near Tel Aviv, Israel December 15, 2019.

The company has started to lose market share to rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O that use outside manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW.  In a pre-recorded presentation streamed on Wednesday, Intel executives focused on real-world performance. Showcasing the new chip's graphics capability, Intel executives claimed better frame-rate performance than rival chips from Nvidia Corp NVDA.O and AMD, and presented a video clip of a young gamer beating her father while his laptop lagged.  Intel announced a new co-brand for Project Athena laptops, co-engineered with manufacturers, that use Tiger Lake chips called \u201cIntel Evo.\u201d The project is aimed at boosting consumer confidence in sometimes-disappointing claims about features such as battery life.  The branding will be available to partners that make high-end machines, similar to the \u201cUltrabook\u201d branding campaign that Intel launched in 2011 after Apple introduced its MacBook Air machines. Apple, which announced in June it would quit using Intel chips and move to its own Apple Silicon chips, plans to release the first such machines this year.","880":"(Reuters) - Mobile phone chip supplier Qualcomm Inc on Friday won a legal victory against iPhone maker Apple Inc, with a jury in federal court in San Diego finding that Apple owes Qualcomm about $31 million for infringing three of its patents.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Qualcomm last year sued Apple alleging it had violated patents related to helping mobile phones get better battery life. During an eight-day trial, Qualcomm asked the jury to award it unpaid patent royalties of up to $1.41 per iPhone that violated the patents.  The $31 million penalty is small change for Apple, the second most valuable U.S. company after Microsoft Corp, with a market value of $866 billion and annual revenue totaling hundreds of billions of dollars. But the setting of a per-phone royalty rate for Qualcomm\u2019s technology gives the chip supplier a fresh line of attack in its two-year old legal battle with Apple.  The biggest case, filed by Apple in early 2017, begins in April. Apple has sought to dismantle what it calls Qualcomm\u2019s illegal business model of both licensing patents and selling chips to phone makers. Qualcomm has accused Apple of using its technology without paying.  \u201cThe technologies invented by Qualcomm and others are what made it possible for Apple to enter the market and become so successful so quickly,\u201d Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm\u2019s general counsel, said in a statement. \u201cWe are gratified that courts all over the world are rejecting Apple\u2019s strategy of refusing to pay for the use of our IP.\u201d  In a statement, Apple said it was disappointed with the outcome.  \u201cQualcomm\u2019s ongoing campaign of patent infringement claims is nothing more than an attempt to distract from the larger issues they face with investigations into their business practices in U.S. federal court, and around the world,\u201d Apple said. It declined to comment on whether it would appeal.  In other cases against Apple, Qualcomm has won sales bans on iPhones in Germany and China, though the Chinese ban has not been enforced and Apple has taken moves it believes allow it to resume sales in Germany.  Qualcomm also suffered a setback with U.S. trade regulators who found that some iPhones infringed one of the San Diego-based company\u2019s patents but declined to bar their importation into the United States, citing the damage such a move would inflict on rival Intel Corp.  The verdict on Friday could come into play in the trial in April because it puts a per-phone dollar figure on some of Qualcomm\u2019s intellectual property. Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing model relies on charging phone makers a cut of the selling price of the phone, a practice Apple has alleged is unfair and illegal.  During an earlier trial between Qualcomm and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Apple executives outlined their company\u2019s extensive negotiations to reduce those license fees to $7.50 per phone for Qualcomm\u2019s patents.  The San Diego jury valued just three of Qualcomm\u2019s patents in the company\u2019s portfolio at $1.41, a figure that the chip supplier believes bolsters its contention that its licensing practices are fair.  \u201cThe three patents found to be infringed in this case represent just a small fraction of Qualcomm\u2019s valuable portfolio of tens of thousands of patents,\u201d Rosenberg said in a statement.  Gaston Kroub, a patent lawyer in New York not involved in the case, said the verdict was clearly a win for Qualcomm. But it does not say much about the value of Qualcomm\u2019s entire patent portfolio and was unlikely to spark settlements discussions, he said.  \u201cApple is very skilled at handling appeals and taking a longer-term view. This isn\u2019t something that will bring Apple to the table with any sense of urgency,\u201d Kroub said.","881":"WASHINGTON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Friday said it was appealing a judge\u2019s decision to block the government from barring Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google from offering WeChat for download in U.S. app stores.

Unlike other technology providers, Apple previously offered rewards only to invited researchers who tried to find flaws in its phones and cloud backups.  At the annual Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas on Thursday, the company said it would open the process to all researchers, add Mac software and other targets, and offer a range of rewards, called \u201cbounties,\u201d for the most significant findings.  The $1 million prize would apply only to remote access to the iPhone kernel without any action from the phone\u2019s user.

Qualcomm, the world\u2019s biggest maker of mobile chips, alleges in federal court in San Diego that Apple violated three of its patents, and is asking for tens of millions of dollars or more in damages.  The patent case is part of a two-year series of lawsuits around the world between the companies. Apple has alleged that Qualcomm engaged in illegal patent practices to protect a dominant position in the chip market, and Qualcomm has accused Apple of using its technology without compensation.  The legal saga will reach a crescendo in April, when an antitrust case filed by Apple in early 2017 heads to trial and challenges the foundation of Qualcomm\u2019s business model.  Since then, Qualcomm has filed a series of patent actions timed to conclude before the antitrust trial and rack up smaller victories against Apple. So far, Qualcomm has won a preliminary finding of infringement by U.S. trade regulators and partial iPhone sales bans in China and Germany, although the Chinese ban has not yet been enforced and Apple has resumed shipping phones in Germany after making changes.  U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw will open an eight-day trial on Monday to determine whether Apple violated Qualcomm patents around helping phones turn on more quickly and save battery life during tasks such as playing video games. Qualcomm alleges that phones with Intel modem chips, which connect phones to wireless data networks, violated the patents.  Apple has responded in court papers that it does not believe the patents are valid and that it does not infringe them. Apple has been found to infringe one of the patents in the suit during an unrelated case before the U.S. International Trade Commission, but that decision is not final and does not bind the court in San Diego. Apple also told trade regulators it believed it had a software solution to avoid the patent.  Qualcomm is asking for up to $1.41 in damages per infringing iPhone sold between mid-2017 and the autumn of 2018. The exact number of iPhones at stake has not been disclosed because Apple has never said how many of its phones contain Intel chips. Analysts believe that half of iPhones during that period contained Intel chips.","889":"* Eikon search string for individual stock moves: * The Day Ahead newsletter: tmsnrt.rs\/2ggOmBi * The Morning News Call newsletter: tmsnrt.rs\/2fwPLTh U.S. stocks climbed on Friday as moderate jobs growth in September offered some relief from a spate of dismal economic data this week that has rankled markets and fueled concerns that the world's largest economy was sliding into a recession.

CEO Jalal Bagherli said he expected a sequential rise in revenue in the second quarter, and that the second half would be stronger than the first, as weakness in China faded towards the end of the first quarter.  Dialog completed a $600 million deal in April to transfer programmers and patents to Apple. That delivered a cash windfall and left a smaller company less reliant on the iPhone maker, which had accounted for three-quarters of revenue.  That meant first-quarter sales declined 11 percent year-on-year, according to results that had already been pre-released in late April that were above the mid-point of earlier guidance.  Dialog\u2019s non-Apple revenue was down 9 percent, year-on-year, due to the China weakness. But new Apple business not covered by the recent deal grew by 92 percent to $46 million as Dialog scored a number of design wins.  Weakness in China and mounting trade friction between Beijing and Washington have caused inventories to pile up in the semiconductor supply chain.  Dialog said its inventories rose by a sequential 4 percent to $155 million, equivalent to 94 days\u2019 forward demand. That represented a 33-day increase in days of inventory cover from the prior quarter.  Dialog expects inventory value to rise, due to seasonal factors, but sees days of inventory - a key measure of the relationship between supply and demand - remaining steady. Its shares traded 1.2 percent lower after the results.

REUTERS\/Edgar Su  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple\u2019s warning about slowing Chinese sales eroded more than $50 billion of its $750 billion market capitalization on Wednesday afternoon. It will also have taken a chunk out of confidence in the global economy. Investors don\u2019t always believe China\u2019s official economic data, but they can\u2019t brush aside news that iPhone sales in the country have rapidly decelerated, even if Apple is possibly at the sharp end of the slowdown.  Chief Executive Tim Cook said in a letter to investors that the U.S. tech firm expects $84 billion of revenue in its latest financial quarter. That\u2019s about 8 percent less than its earlier guidance. Cook said the company was surprised by the magnitude of the economic deceleration in emerging markets, \u201cparticularly in Greater China,\u201d and said that the fall in revenue relative to what was expected is all accounted for by lower iPhone revenue. Markets had already ended 2018 on a wobbly note; Apple shares fell 8 percent after Wednesday\u2019s close.  China accounted for nearly 20 percent of all Apple revenue in the last quarter, so Cook is implying a very sharp fall in Chinese demand. This could be merely one company\u2019s experience \u2013 the price of the average iPhone sold has risen by about 30 percent over the past year. There are other factors that are still impossible to quantify, like the effect of trade tensions, questions over spying and the detention of an executive from Chinese telecoms-equipment maker Huawei in December, all of which may have made iconic American goods less popular in the Middle Kingdom.  Still, Cook was careful to point out that smartphone sales overall in China have contracted. And it was already pretty clear that things weren\u2019t going great in the Chinese economy, which contributes around one-fifth of the world\u2019s output, according to the International Monetary Fund.

Qualcomm made the accusations in a motion to amend a complaint that was originally filed in November, when it alleged that Apple had broken a software license contract by sharing confidential details about Qualcomm\u2019s chips with Intel engineers. The Tuesday allegations were made in a planned legal filing seen by Reuters.  They go further than the original complaint by alleging Apple stole Qualcomm trade secrets in a \u201cmulti-year campaign of sloppy, inappropriate and deceitful conduct ... for the purpose of improving lower-quality modem chipsets, including those manufactured by Intel, a competitor of Qualcomm, to render such chipsets useable in Apple devices with the ultimate goal of diverting Qualcomm\u2019s Apple-based business to Intel.\u201d  Intel is not named as a defendant in Qualcomm\u2019s lawsuit.  The San Diego County lawsuit is unfolding amid a wide-ranging legal dispute in which Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices. Qualcomm, the world\u2019s largest mobile phone chipmaker, has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement.  Qualcomm provided modem chips for the iPhone, which helped the device connect to wireless data networks. Starting with the iPhone 7, Apple began using Intel modem chips in some of its models.  Qualcomm has told investors in July that it believes its modem chips have been completely removed from the newest generation of iPhones, which were released this month, leaving Intel as the sole supplier. Tear downs of the new devices have so far confirmed that Intel is supplying modem chips.  But during the years when Apple used Qualcomm modems, Qualcomm provided Apple access to its confidential software tools to help Apple integrate the modems into the iPhone, Qualcomm\u2019s suit alleges. Qualcomm on Tuesday alleged that, since the start of its lawsuit in November, it has discovered evidence that Apple engineers \u201crepeatedly\u201d used Qualcomm software to help Intel\u2019s engineers to \u201cimprove the sub-par performance of Intel\u2019s chipsets.\u201d  \u201cIn fact, it apparently improved Intel chipsets to the point where Apple decided to divert some of Qualcomm\u2019s Apple-based business to Intel,\u201d Qualcomm wrote in its filing.  Qualcomm in its filing asked Judge Jacqueline M. Stern to allow it to attach the new allegations to its existing complaint rather than force it to file a new lawsuit.

Bets of interest rate cuts by the Fed have surged this week after a dramatic contraction in U.S. manufacturing, cooling private sector hiring and a fall in service sector activity evidenced the fallout from a prolonged U.S.-China trade war.  Traders currently see a 77.5% chance for the central bank to lower borrowing costs at its policy meeting later this month, up from 40% on Monday.  The Fed cut rates in September for the second time this year and said future reductions would be \u201cdata-dependent\u201d.  The S&P had gapped lower on Wednesday after bleak manufacturing data, but Friday\u2019s gains have helped the index climb back to near its Tuesday close.

Boxes of iPhones purchased by customers are pictured next to an iPhone XS on display at the Apple Store in Singapore September 21, 2018. REUTERS\/Edgar Su  The studies by repair firm iFixit here and chip analysis firm TechInsights here, published this week, are among the first detailed teardowns of the phones, which reviews suggested were a subtle upgrade from the tenth anniversary iPhone X.  Supplying parts for Apple\u2019s iPhones is considered a coup for chipmakers and other manufacturers. While Apple publishes a broad list of suppliers each year, it does not disclose which companies make which components and insists its suppliers keep quiet.  That makes teardowns the only way of establishing the breakdown of parts in the phones, although analysts also recommend caution in drawing conclusions because Apple sometimes uses more than one supplier for a part. What is found in one iPhone may not be found in others.  Apple could not immediately be reached for comment.  The breakdowns listed no parts from Samsung 005930.KS and no chips from Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O.  Samsung in the past has supplied memory chips for Apple\u2019s iPhones and was believed by analysts to be the sole supplier of the costly displays for last year\u2019s iPhone X.  Qualcomm has been a supplier of components to Apple for years, but the two have been locked in a wide-ranging legal dispute in which Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices.  U.S.-based Qualcomm, the world\u2019s largest mobile phone chipmaker, has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement.  Qualcomm said in July that Apple intended to solely use \u201ccompetitor\u2019s modems\u201d in its next iPhone release.  The iFixit teardown showed iPhone Xs and Xs Max used Intel\u2019s modem and communication chips instead of Qualcomm\u2019s hardware.  The latest iPhones also had DRAM and NAND memory chips from Micron Technology MU.O and Toshiba, according to iFixit's study. Previous teardowns of the iPhone 7 had shown DRAM chips made by Samsung in some models.  TechInsights' dissection of a 256-gigabyte storage capacity iPhone Xs Max, on the other hand, revealed DRAM from Micron but NAND memory from SanDisk, which is owned by Western Digital Corp WDC.O and works with Toshiba for its supply of NAND chips.  Toshiba\u2019s chip unit Toshiba Memory was purchased by a private equity-led consortium earlier this year that Apple joined.  In the past, TechInsights found Apple used different DRAM and NAND suppliers in the same generation of phones.  \u201cFor memory \u2013 Apple obviously competes with Samsung and wants to reduce their reliance as much as possible \u2013 so totally consistent that we\u2019d see Toshiba for NAND flash storage and Micron for DRAM,\u201d Morningstar analyst Abhinav Davuluri said.  Jim Morrison, vice president of TechInsights, said in an interview that it appeared that one of Dialog Semiconductor's DLGS.DE chips had been replaced in the iPhone Xs Max by one of Apple's own chips, but it was not yet known whether that also applied to the iPhone Xs.  Dialog declined to comment. In May, the company said Apple had cut orders for its chips.  IFixit and TechInsights technicians also found components from companies including Skyworks Solutions SWKS.O, Broadcom AVGO.O, Murata 6981.T, NXP Semiconductors NXPI.O, Cypress Semiconductor CY.O, Texas Instruments TXN.O and STMicroelectronics STM.BN.","900":"(Adds more details from letter, related story link)  SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook on Thursday defended the iPhone maker\u2019s decision to remove from its app store a police-tracking app used by protesters in Hong Kong, according to a copy of a letter to employees seen by Reuters and confirmed by Apple.

Slideshow ( 4 images )  Last May, Rio and Alcoa announced a joint venture, backed by Apple, to commercialize by 2024 a process that emits oxygen and replaces all direct greenhouse gas emissions from the traditional smelting process for aluminum.  Bauxite is the raw material for aluminum, which is used in everything from beer cans to aeroplanes and is expected to gain greater use in a decarbonizing economy as a lightweight alternative to steel. However, it is still one of the most carbon-intensive metals to produce.  \u201cAt the end of the day, what we can see is the customers of our customers want to have full traceability on their products, and they want to make sure they have a carbon-friendly product,\u201d Jacques said on Friday at the unveiling of Rio\u2019s new Amrun bauxite mine in northern Australia.  \u201cThe technology that we are developing is - instead of using the carbon anodes - is to use an anode made of ceramic so you would not consume any carbon, and you would not release any CO2 into the atmosphere,\u201d he said.  Rio, which has pledged substantial decarbonization by 2050, is reshaping its aluminum division longer term to focus on supply chain transparency and lowering emissions, Jacques said.  \u201cWe are looking at the next wave of partnership with Apple,\u201d Jacques said, although he provided no further details.  If the new smelting process under development proves commercially viable, he said, Rio would retrofit its entire fleet of existing smelters with the technology.  The miner has also taken steps to have its Amrun bauxite mine certified by a scheme that signifies it is ethically sourced, given its land use, heritage and working agreements with local indigenous groups.  \u201c(We will show) that Amrun is part of the supply chain, so we can demonstrate from the bauxite to the aluminum in your iPhone or in your laptop, we fully understand the entire chain and that is consistent with what customers like Apple want,\u201d Jacques said.  Global mining majors have been highlighting their climate and community credentials as they look to repair an image tarnished by environmental disasters and overspending, amid pressure from investors with an environmental, social and governance, or ESG, agenda.  Jacques said in Melbourne last year that mining had an image problem as \u201cone of the least trusted on the planet\u201d.  Rio has several aluminum plants in Australia and is among the country\u2019s top five carbon emitters, according to combined data from the Clean Energy Regulator that counts direct emissions and indirect emissions from purchased power use.  In a climate report last month, Rio said it produced 28.6 million tonnes of such emissions last year but that it was on track to beat a target of reducing its emissions intensity by 24 percent from 2008 levels by 2020.","903":"(Reuters) - The late launch of new 5G phones caused Apple Inc's AAPL.O customers to put off buying new devices, leading the company on Thursday to report the steepest quarterly drop in iPhone sales in two years.  Apple fell over 5% at one point in after-hours trade, wiping $100 billion from its stock market value.  Since 2013, Apple has delivered new iPhones each September like clockwork. But pandemic-induced delays pushed the announcement back a month, with some devices still yet to ship.  Even as booming sales of Macs and AirPods boosted overall revenue and profit above what analysts had expected, iPhone sales dropped 20.7% to $26.4 billion. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/3ecmgCG)  Investors anticipated lower sales from the Cupertino, California company\u2019s bestselling product, but the hold-back was worse than expected, especially in China, where more consumers have access to 5G than in the United States or Europe.  Apple has mostly beaten sales expectations this year and released a slew of new products and services that its customers have embraced while largely homebound during the pandemic.  Apple said revenue and profits for the fiscal fourth quarter ended on Sept. 26 was $64.7 billion and 73 cents per share, compared with analyst estimates of $63.7 billion and 70 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  But the flagship iPhone 12\u2019s announcement was delayed until Oct. 13, several weeks later than usual, meaning no opening-weekend iPhone sales are included in the fourth-quarter results.  In an interview with Reuters, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about the iPhone 12 cycle based on the first five days of shipping data.  \u201c5G is a once-in-a-decade kind of opportunity. And we could not be more excited to hit the market exactly when we did,\u201d Cook said. \u201cAt least in the U.S., the carriers are being very aggressive.\u201d  The iPhone 12 release timing drove down sales in Greater China by 28.5% to $7.95 billion. Cook said he expects the new 5G devices to help iPhone sales recover in China.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in the early going in the first five days gives us a lot of confidence that China will return to growth in our fiscal Q1,\u201d Cook told Reuters.  Apple did not provide a revenue growth forecast, but Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said revenue from services and non-iPhone products would grow by double-digit percentages in the fiscal first quarter, in line with analyst expectations. He said iPhone revenue would also grow, implying the rate would be in the single digits. Analysts expect iPhone revenue to rise 6.45% to $59.56 billion in the first quarter, according to Refinitiv data.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Logan Purk, an analyst with Edward Jones, said that \u201cwhile iPhone sales will grow this cycle, it will be disappointing compared to elevated expectations, as we do not believe the 5G presents a compelling reason for a wave of upgrades.\u201d  Apple has offset volatile iPhone sales in recent years with steady growth in its services segment, which includes streaming music and television. Services revenue rose 16.3% to $14.5 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $14 billion. Cook told Reuters that Apple One, a bundle of Apple\u2019s paid services, will launch on Friday.  Cook told Reuters that Apple has 585 million paying subscribers across its platforms, up from 550 million the previous quarter and closer to the goal of 600 million subscribers that the company set out for the end of calendar 2020.  Apple\u2019s shares have soared in the past two years as it has diversified its revenue streams to lessen its dependence on the iPhone. The share tumble on Thursday raises the question of whether Apple is still more dependent on iPhone sales than some investors had hoped.  \u201cApple needs to be able to keep the upgrade cycle going or the share price will wobble because there\u2019s no real room for forgiveness in the current valuation,\u201d said Sophie Lund-Yates, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.  Apple said revenue from its accessories segment was up 20.8% to $7.9 billion, compared with analyst estimates of a 13.5% rise to $7.4 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Mac and iPad sales rose to $9.0 billion and $6.8 billion, compared with estimates of $7.92 billion and $6.12 billion, according to Refinitiv data.","904":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in an Eikon news window.)  * Apple tumbles on sales forecast cut, blames China  * Indexes drop: Dow 1.40 pct, S&P 1.22 pct, Nasdaq 1.72 pct  * Technology biggest drag among 11 major S&P sectors  * Chipmakers, mainly Apple suppliers lead decliners  * Trade-sensitive industrials also fall  * Celgene soars on Bristol-Myers\u2019 $74 bln offer (Updates to open)  Jan 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slumped on Thursday, after Apple Inc\u2019s rare sales warning exacerbated fears that the Sino-U.S. trade war and a slowing China economy would eat into corporate profits, with weaker-than-expected U.S. factory data adding to nerves.  Apple sank 8.5 percent, the biggest drag on the three major Wall Street indexes, after the company slashed its holiday-quarter revenue forecast on slowing iPhone sales in China, the first major warning with the U.S. earnings season around the corner.  The S&P technology sector dropped 3.47 percent, leading declines on the S&P 500.  Chipmakers, which count both Apple and China as major customers, weighed the most on the sector.

At 9:59 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 325.79 points, or 1.40 percent, at 23,020.45, the S&P 500 was down 30.55 points, or 1.22 percent, at 2,479.48 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 114.96 points, or 1.72 percent, at 6,550.98.  Apple\u2019s slide is a gloomy omen for Wall Street bulls hoping for an early gift in 2019 following December\u2019s steep selloff.  Though the selloff has made stocks cheaper, with the S&P 500\u2019s valuation now at 14 times expected earnings from 18 times a year earlier, earnings estimates have also been sharply cut.  Analysts on average expect S&P 500 companies to increase their earnings per share by nearly 7 percent this year, down from a forecast of 10 percent at the start of October and far below their expectations of 24 percent EPS growth for 2018, according to Refinitiv\u2019s IBES.  Apple\u2019s warning follows data earlier this week that showed a deceleration in factory activity in China and the euro zone, indicating the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute was taking a toll on global manufacturing.  The Institute of Supply Management data showed on Thursday that U.S. factory activity slowed more than expected in December. The ISM index of national factory activity fell to 54.1 in December, falling short of economists\u2019 estimate of 57.9.  The trade-sensitive industrials sector fell 1.4 percent, with trade bellwethers Boeing Co and Caterpillar Inc dropping over 2 percent each.  Markets had taken some comfort from the ADP National Employment Report which showed U.S. private sector jobs rose far more than expected in December.  Celgene Corp jumped 28 percent, providing the biggest boost to the S&P 500, after Bristol-Myers Squibb Co offered to buy the drugmaker for about $74 billion in a cash-and-stock deal. Bristol-Myers fell 12.6 percent.  Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.84-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 2.47-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.  The S&P index recorded no new 52-week highs and 7 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded no new highs and 15 new lows.

Apple said it had \u201cno choice\u201d but to stop using some chips from Intel Corp in iPhones headed to Germany in order to comply with a patent infringement lawsuit Qualcomm won against Apple there in December.  Qualcomm, the world\u2019s biggest supplier of mobile chips, sued Apple in Germany alleging that some older iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models violated Qualcomm patents around so-called envelope tracking, a feature that helps mobile phones save battery power while sending and receiving wireless signals. The alleged patent violation stemmed not from Intel chips but yet another Apple supplier - Qorvo Inc - whose chip was only present in older phones with Intel modems.  The court sided with Qualcomm and banned sales of some iPhone models that used Intel modem chips, leading Apple to pull the devices from its 15 retail stories in Germany and its online store in the country.  The ban was a victory in Qualcomm\u2019s legal conflict with Apple.  The iPhone maker has alleged that Qualcomm engaged in illegal patent licensing practices to protect a monopoly on so-called modem chips, which connect mobile phones to wireless data networks. Qualcomm has in turn alleged that Apple has infringed its patents. A major case between the two goes to trial in the United States in April.  Apple began phasing in Intel\u2019s modem chips in 2016 after years of using chips exclusively from Qualcomm. In last year\u2019s iPhone models, Apple dropped Qualcomm\u2019s chips completely in favor of Intel\u2019s.

With its access to world-class software and a secure ecosystem, Apple could tackle the problem individuals face acquiring crypto assets due to know-your-customer laws and other regulations with the company offering a closed system that prevents nefarious activity, improves asset security, and has instant access to buyers and sellers, the report said.

Apple has proceeded cautiously with cryptocurrencies. The company banned cryptocurrency wallets from its App Store in 2014, but later reversed the decision and now allows them. However, Apple bans mining for cryptocurrencies on iPhones and does not allow its Apple Card credit card to be used to purchase cryptocurrencies.","910":"Apple has been sued by a group of consumers alleging that its iPhone XR, released in 2018, had an inferior antenna to other iPhones.

The complaint filed on Tuesday seeks damages for investors who bought Apple stock in the two months before Chief Executive Tim Cook on Jan. 2 unexpectedly reduced Apple\u2019s quarterly revenue forecast as much as $9 billion, in part because of the intensifying U.S. trade war with China.

The lawsuit was filed in the federal court in Oakland, California by the City of Roseville Employees\u2019 Retirement System, a Michigan pension plan.  It is represented by Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, a securities class-action specialist.  The complaint said iPhone demand was falling because of U.S.-China trade tensions and customers\u2019 growing preference to replace batteries in older iPhones, prompting Apple to slash orders from suppliers for new iPhones and cut prices to reduce inventory.  But none of this was disclosed when it should have been, the complaint said, in part because of Apple\u2019s Nov. 1, 2018 decision to stop disclosing unit sales for iPhones.

Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., December 7, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Plummeting stock prices in recent months have mostly outpaced a simultaneous decline in earnings expectations, presenting potential opportunities to buy beaten down stocks. But apparent bargains could turn out to be expensive if earnings expectations take a turn for the worse next year as the United States continues its trade dispute with China.  Since Apple\u2019s November forecast for a weaker-than-expected holiday shopping quarter and other reports of sluggish demand for iPhones, analysts have cut estimates for the Cupertino, California-based company\u2019s December-quarter net income by almost $1 billion. Apple\u2019s stock last week traded at a nearly two-year low of 13 times expected earnings, even after accounting for analysts\u2019 reduced expectations.  Already, the so-called FANG group of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet shares has seen its weight within the S&P 500 dwindle to 8 percent from as much as 10 percent in July, with investors fleeing what for years was Wall Street\u2019s most popular trade.  Since the U.S. stock market abruptly dropped in early October, Apple has lost a quarter of its value, and last week it relinquished its title as Wall Street's most valuable company to Microsoft Corp MSFT.O. Since then, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon have been battling to be No. 1.  Netflix has slumped 20 percent since early October, while Facebook and Amazon are both down over 10 percent. Alphabet, the least badly performing of the group, has lost 9 percent, a little worse than the S&P 500\u2019s 8 percent decline.  Investors in recent months have become increasingly worried that an ongoing U.S.-China trade conflict may hobble U.S. multinationals just as a year-long an surge in earnings growth caused by new corporate tax cuts is set to end.  Tech investors have also become more concerned about a global smartphone market that is losing steam, but the resulting drop in Apple\u2019s stock has outpaced analysts\u2019 reduced earnings expectations. Apple and other big tech names are trading at the lowest multiples of their prices to expected earnings in years, suggesting recent selling might be overdone.  \u201cThere are some attractive buying opportunities,\u201d said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. \u201cWe are buying Microsoft, and we could add some Apple and some Alphabet at these levels.\u201d  Facebook, plagued for months by criticism of its use of people\u2019s personal data and fears that it could face more regulation, recently traded at 19 times expected earnings, its lowest ever. That compares to a multiple of 45 times after Facebook went public in 2012.  Amazon\u2019s stock is now trading at 64 times expected earnings, it lowest multiple since 2012. Netflix\u2019s price\/earnings multiple has dropped to 68, its lowest since 2015.  Newly enacted corporate tax cuts supercharged U.S. earnings this year, but their effect on profit growth will end in the December quarter, leading analysts on average to predict S&P 500 earnings per share next year will rise 8 percent, compared to 24 percent in 2018, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  \u201cThe question going into 2019 is, \u2018Are you seeing enough of a pullback in those sectors that led that would entice investors to accept the lower valuations as an opportunity?\u2019\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.","920":"SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Fortnite maker Epic Games has used a famous Apple advertisement against the iPhone maker in a social media campaign accompanying a legal battle it launched on Thursday.

The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) said that the Japanese unit of Apple had forced NTT Docomo Inc 9437.T , KDDI Corp 9433.T and SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T to offer subsidies and sell iPhones at a discount.  \u201cObliging carriers to offer subsidies (for iPhones) could have prevented the carriers from offering lower monthly charges and restricted competition,\u201d the FTC said in a statement.  The FTC, which began looking into Apple\u2019s sales practices in 2016, did not punish Apple as the U.S. company had agreed to revise its contracts with the carriers, it said.  Apple representatives in Japan were not immediately available for comment.  The U.S. company accounts for one in every two smartphones sold in Japan, according to MM Research Institute Ltd, making Japan one of its most profitable markets.  The carriers sold the iPhones at a discount, the FTC said, giving Apple an advantage over rivals such as Samsung Electronics 005930.KS.  In order to make up for the losses, they locked consumers into lucrative two- and four-year contracts, the watchdog said.  In revising the contracts, Apple has agreed to allow the carriers to offer customers a choice of buying iPhones without subsidies but paying lower monthly charges, the FTC said.","928":"BOSTON, MA.(Reuters) - U.S. technology giants are increasingly dominating the stock market in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, even as they draw accusations of unfair business practices, and some investors fear the pump is primed for a tech-fueled sell-off.  FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen placed on a keyboard in this illustration taken March 25, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The combined value of the S&P 500's five biggest companies - Apple Inc AAPL.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Facebook Inc FB.O and Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O - now stands at more than $7 trillion, accounting for almost 25% of the index's market capitalization. That compares with less than 20% pre-pandemic.  The quintet\u2019s burgeoning share prices reflect a transition to an increasingly technology-driven economy that has been accelerated by the coronavirus outbreak, as doorways fill with Amazon packages, homebound families stream movies and friends commiserate on Facebook.  Yet the companies are drawing opposition. U.S. lawmakers are accusing them of stifling competition, a charge also leveled in recent days against Apple by Epic Games, creator of the popular game Fortnite.  Some investors worry the companies powering this year\u2019s equity rally could become the market\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel if a legal assault, a shift to undervalued names or a move higher in bond yields dries up appetite for technology stocks.  \u201cPeople see these companies as winners and investors are willing to pay any price to own them,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. \u201cThat\u2019s always a risk.\u201d  LEGAL THREAT  One potential threat comes from an array of investigations and legal actions.  The latest came Monday, when a federal judge temporarily blocked Apple from cutting off all the developer accounts of Epic Games, pending a full hearing on the issue. It was a partial win for Epic, which had called Apple\u2019s rules an anticompetitive abuse of power.  The standoff centers on Apple\u2019s App Store, which forms the centerpiece of a $46.3 billion-per-year services business that has helped buoy the company\u2019s share price.  The decision \u201cis just a first battle of many on the horizon,\u201d said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. \u201cFrom a valuation perspective, there\u2019s clearly an overhang around antitrust.\u201d  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Wedbush nevertheless raised its target price for Apple on Wednesday to $700 a share in a \u201cbull case\u201d scenario, citing a \u201conce in a decade\u201d opportunity to take advantage of as many as 950 million potential iPhone upgrades worldwide.  Apple shares on Thursday closed at $500.04.  Still, this week\u2019s Apple court decision may be a taste of things to come for technology giants, whose influence has been one of the few issues capable of galvanizing bipartisan interest among lawmakers.  Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon and Apple face a series of federal government probes into allegations that they unfairly defend their market share, with litigation against Alphabet possible later this year.  \u201cThese few behemoths dominate their industry and can set the rules of the global economy,\u201d said U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat who has been outspoken about antitrust issues. \u201cThis kind of concentrated power is always dangerous.\u201d  The opposition is a worry for investors hoping the companies will continue delivering robust growth that justifies their valuations.  Amazon said it operates in a \u201cfiercely competitive\u201d market, citing U.S. Census Bureau data that only about 10% of U.S. retail sales occur online.  Apple declined comment. The company previously said it competes vigorously against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS and other Android device makers in the smart phone markets.  Alphabet declined comment. It previously said it competes with Amazon, Microsoft, Comcast Corp CMCSA.O, AT&T Inc T.N and many others.  Facebook and Microsoft had no immediate comment.  INVESTMENT DILEMMA  For some investors, the companies embody a dilemma that has dogged them at various times during the last decade. Many have found that cutting exposure to tech-related shares has limited portfolio performance over the long term.  The Big Five have seen their shares jump 22% or more to record highs this year, with Amazon soaring 86%. By comparison, the median stock performance across the S&P 500 year-to-date is a 4% drop.  The companies\u2019 \u201cincreased market share ... provides potentially huge opportunities supporting growth prospects over many years,\u201d said David Polak, equity investment director at $1.7 trillion Capital Group, which owns shares of big technology companies.  Still, some worry that a bad patch in the companies\u2019 widely owned shares could trigger violent swings in broader markets.  Goldman Sachs analysts said in a recent report that the S&P 500 \u201chas never been more dependent on the continued strength of its largest constituents.\u201d  Another risk is a broad-based economic rebound boosting earnings of companies that have underperformed during the pandemic, potentially making their shares more competitive with tech stocks, said Edwin Jager, head of fundamental equities at hedge fund firm DE Shaw & Co, which oversees more than $50 billion.  In addition, a sustained rise in bond yields could make growth stocks less attractive, Jager said. Longer-term Treasury yields hit multi-month highs on Thursday after the Federal Reserve announced a shift in monetary strategy.  A change of sentiment toward big tech could take a comparatively heavier toll on the shares of less profitable technology companies that have rallied alongside the market\u2019s giants.  Investors justify these stocks on the basis that \u201cthis time it\u2019s different,\u201d said Ed Cole, managing director of equities at $27 billion Man GLG. \u201cIt rarely ever is.\u201d","929":"NEW YORK, Feb 18 (Reuters) - The Dow and S&P fell on Tuesday while the Nasdaq ended just above the unchanged mark as a sales warning from tech bellwether Apple highlighted the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on global supply chains.

The outlook reaffirms Cook\u2019s strategy to remake a company that consistently depended on iPhone sales for well over half its revenue to one that depends on services and wearables. Since 2017, Cook has had to implement the strategy while also shepherding Apple through a trade dispute between two of its most important markets, the United States and China.  Apple said it expects $85.5 billion to $89.5 billion in sales for its fiscal first quarter that ends in December, with a midpoint of $87.5 billion that is above analyst expectations of $86.9 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  In an interview with Reuters, Cook said that the revenue guidance was based on strong sales of services and wearables, as well as promising early sales for the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max released last month. Cook said the forecast also reflects the company\u2019s belief that the United States and China will resolve their trade dispute.  \u201cI don\u2019t know every chapter of the book, but I think that will eventually happen,\u201d Cook told Reuters. \u201cI certainly hope it happens during the quarter, but we\u2019ll see about that.\u201d  The forecast comes as Apple said it generated $33.36 billion in iPhone sales for its fiscal fourth quarter ended in September, which compares with analyst expectations of $32.42 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  The results mark the fourth straight quarter of year-over-year declining iPhone sales as the Cupertino, California-based company tries to shift its business away from reliance on the flagship product and toward a broader product mix.  But the above-expectations forecast for the holiday shopping quarter - traditionally Apple\u2019s biggest sales quarter of the year - suggested that Apple\u2019s price cuts on many iPhones were helping it regain momentum.  In September, the company unveiled a lineup that included the new iPhone 11 priced at $699, $50 lower than the debut price of its predecessor, the iPhone XR. Moreover, Apple has broken with its past practice of offering few discounts by continuing to run aggressive trade-in deals that lower upgrade prices for existing iPhone owners in the United States.  \u201cThe starting price of $699 is a factor in bringing more people into the market and giving people just another reason to upgrade,\u201d Cook told Reuters. \u201cIn China specifically ... we picked locally relevant price points that were more similar to the price points that had great success with earlier.\u201d  Apple\u2019s revenue is increasingly coming from accessories such as the Apple Watch and AirPods as well as new services such as its Apple Card credit card and a streaming television service set to begin on Friday.  Apple said its services and accessories segments generated $12.51 billion and $6.52 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, respectively, topping analyst estimates of $12.15 billion and $6 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Apple now has 450 million subscribers to its own or third-party services on its devices, and sales of wearables were up 54% versus the previous year.  \u201cIt was an incredible quarter for wearables,\u201d Cook said. \u201cIt was a very broad range of services that set new all-time records, from our payment services to the search ad business to Apple Music, Apple Care, the App Store and cloud services - almost every kind of service we\u2019re in.\u201d  Apple also earlier this year lowered iPhone prices in China, which had risen beyond the reach of many buyers there because of currency fluctuations. The move helped slow mid-year sales declines for Apple in China, and Apple sales for its Greater China region dropped a relatively modest 2.4% to $11.13 billion in Apple\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter ended in September.  Apple\u2019s Cook said that iPhone sales in China ticked up toward the end of the quarter, which includes several days of sales of the new iPhone 11 models. Cook also said the company saw double-digit services revenue growth in China and wearables revenue in China grew at a higher rate than the companywide figure.  \u201cIPhone had a remarkable comeback from the way we performed earlier in the year,\u201d Cook said.  Apple\u2019s holiday-quarter forecast comes amid a trade conflict between the United States and China, where Apple assembles most of its products and where many of its suppliers are located. Tariffs on imports that would include Apple accessories took effect in September, though Apple has not said whether it has been affected or would pass the cost to consumers.  Tariffs might hit more categories of goods including Apple\u2019s iPhone on Dec. 15, though U.S. and Chinese negotiators were working to try to agree on a deal in time for U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to sign in the coming weeks.  Apple said its revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter was $64.04 billion, compared with analyst expectations of $62.99 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Earnings per share were $3.03 versus expectations of $2.84.  For the fiscal first quarter of 2020, Apple said it expects gross margins of between 37.5% and 38.5%, compared with analyst expectations of 37.55%. The company forecasted first-quarter operating expenses of $9.6 billion to $9.8 billion, compared with expectations of $9.4 billion, and an effective tax rate of 16.5%, compared to expectations of 16.49%.

The event is nearly one month later than normal and comes as the coronavirus pandemic has disrupted Apple\u2019s well-oiled machine for designing and churning out its biggest-selling product.  Wall Street analysts widely expect Apple to launch four new iPhones at the event broadcast from its Cupertino, California headquarters at 1 p.m. ET (1700 GMT). (www.apple.com\/apple-events\/)  Two will be \u201cPro\u201d models expected to have more camera sensors and a higher-quality display, with one coming in a large version for fans of big screens. In the middle is likely to sit an iPhone 12 with the broadest appeal: A big enough display and enough cameras to satisfy most of Apple\u2019s fans, with a more attractive price.  Finally, analysts expect Apple to return to offering a smaller-screened model of its flagship phone after several years of relegating fans of smaller devices to its legacy models.  The iPhones announced Tuesday will test whether Apple can keep up that streak and ride a wave of consumer excitement around 5G wireless data networks, whose speediest variants outstrip their predecessors\u2019 data rates multiple times over. Android devices from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and others have featured the new networking capabilities for months, and analysts say 5G phones are driving upgrades.  But Apple is in a delicate position of needing to excite consumers with 5G without setting them up for a disappointment: For many of its fans, it will be their first experience with 5G networks, which in the United States remain years away from delivering dramatic speed boosts for most consumers. Some analysts worry Apple will be selling a high-powered sports car while its customers remain confined to sleepy village roadways.  Ahead of the event, Apple\u2019s stock jumped 6.4% on Monday, adding $128 billion to its stock market value.  Apple in January quit giving financial guidance, citing uncertainty from the pandemic.

MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged down 0.1 percent, weighed by a fall in Chinese shares and technology stocks while Japan\u2019s Nikkei managed to gain 1.0 percent.  Shares in Asia-Pacific Apple suppliers, such as Taiwan\u2019s Hon Hai Precision Industry, eased after Apple Inc lost 2.8 percent following a report in the Nikkei newspaper that Apple had told smartphone assemblers to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to the iPhone XR.  On Wall Street, the S&P 500 gained 0.56 percent, with financials such as Berkshire Hathaway supported by strong earnings.  In oil markets, crude prices wobbled near multi-month lows after the United States granted eight countries temporary waivers allowing them to continue buying oil from Iran as Washington formally imposed punitive sanctions on the Islamic republic.  Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s U.S. elections, investors generally expect opposition Democrats to take over the House of Representatives while Trump\u2019s Republican Party is tipped to retain the Senate.  While political gridlock between the White House and Congress could hinder Trump\u2019s pro-business agenda and raise political instability, including hearings centring on the administration, some analysts say such an outcome may have already been priced in by investors.  If the Republicans retain their House majority, global stocks are likely to rally on hopes of more tax cuts.  Trump said last month his administration planned to produce a resolution calling for a 10 percent tax cut for middle-income households.  \u201cEveryone still remembers strong equity rallies after Trump was elected two years ago. So initially stock markets will gain,\u201d said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.  \u201cBut further tax cuts would boost already large fiscal deficits and push the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield above its October high almost instantly. Given rises in U.S. bond yields triggered a correction in equities last month, any rally in stocks is unlikely to last long,\u201d he added.  The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield stood at 3.203 percent , maintaining most of its gains following Friday\u2019s strong U.S. jobs and wage data and staying not far from its 7 1\/2-year peak of 3.261 percent hit on Oct. 9.  \u201cGlobal equities have recovered after their fall in February, which was triggered by rise in U.S. yields. But this time a recovery will likely be capped because now markets do not have the support they had back in February from tame inflation and the economic boost from Trump\u2019s tax cuts,\u201d said Shuji Shirota, head of macro-economic strategy at HSBC in Tokyo.  Many investors also expect Trump to continue to take a hard line on trade, regardless of the outcome of the elections.  \u201cThe impact of trade war will start to appear in U.S. economic data in coming months,\u201d Shirota added.  But some other analysts noted that U.S. equities tended to rally after midterm elections, possibly because markets tend to price in political risks ahead of the elections.  In oil markets, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures slipped 0.3 percent to $62.86 a barrel after hitting a seven-month low of $62.52 on Monday.

Berkshire has more than 90 businesses in the insurance, energy, food and retail, industrial and other sectors, and invests in companies such as Apple, Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N and Coca-Cola Co KO.N.  A buy-back policy announced in July gave Buffett, who has gone 2-1\/2 years since a major acquisition, a new way to deploy Berkshire\u2019s $111.1 billion of cash and equivalents.  Berkshire said the policy frees Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger to repurchase stock when the price was below Berkshire\u2019s \u201cintrinsic value,\u201d a determination that would be made \u201cconservatively.\u201d  The old policy allowed buybacks when Berkshire traded at below 1.2 times book value, but the Omaha, Nebraska-based company\u2019s shares have long traded above that level.  Buffett said \u201cwe\u2019ve bought back a little\u201d stock since the change, and that he and Munger need \u201ca big enough discount\u201d to ensure that long-term shareholders are better off.  Berkshire has also bought \u201cjust a little\u201d more Apple stock since June 30, he said, when it had a 252 million share stake now worth more than $56 billion.  Buffett is also a happy Apple customer.  He said he uses his iPad \u201ca lot,\u201d and that the iPhone is \u201cenormously underpriced\u201d even when it costs $1,000, given how indispensable it has become for many people.  Buffett spoke at the Smith & Wollensky steak house in Manhattan before dining with the person who in June agreed to pay $3,300,100 at an annual charity auction to join him.  At the restaurant, Buffett held court for hours, over a meal that typically includes his signature Cherry Coke and a $59 Colorado rib eye steak. Guests sang happy birthday, and Buffett was given a cake.  Auction proceeds benefit the Glide Foundation, a San Francisco charity that serves people who are poor, homeless or battling substance abuse. The winning bid was the third-highest in 19 years of auctions, which have raised $29.6 million.","942":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc on Saturday said it would shut all of its official stores and corporate offices in mainland China until Feb 9. as fears over the coronavirus outbreak mounted and the death toll more than doubled to over 250 from a week ago.  \u201cOut of an abundance of caution and based on the latest advice from leading health experts, we\u2019re closing all our corporate offices, stores, and contact centers in mainland China through February 9,\u201d Apple said in a statement. The company said looked forward to re-opening stores \u201cas soon as possible\u201d.  Earlier this week, Apple closed three stores in China due to concerns about the spread of the virus.  It\u2019s joining a handful of overseas retailers, including Starbucks Corp and McDonald\u2019s Corp to temporarily shut storefronts as a precautionary measure.  Many other companies, meanwhile, have called for employees in China to work from home and cease non-essential business travel in the first week of February.  Normally, businesses in China would be preparing to return to normal operations following the end of the week-long Lunar New Year Holiday.  Apple remains heavily reliant on China both for smartphone sales as well as for its supply chain and manufacturing. Many factories in Hubei province, including plants run by AB InBev and General Motors Co, have temporarily suspended production due to the virus.  In a recent earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company was working out mitigation plans to deal with possible production loss from its suppliers in Wuhan. The city where the virus outbreak originated is home to several Apple suppliers.","943":"FILE PHOTO: A sign to the campus offices of chip maker Broadcom Ltd is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., November 6, 2017.

Analysts expect the company to release a range of 5G iPhone models later this year, but the Nikkei Asian Review reported in March that Apple was considering delaying the launch due to product development disruptions and the economic turmoil caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic.

In a 5-4 ruling, the justices upheld a lower court\u2019s decision to allow the proposed class action lawsuit to proceed. The consumer plaintiffs claim Apple monopolized the market in violation of federal antitrust law by requiring that apps be sold through its App Store and extracting an excessive 30 percent commission on purchases.  Apple\u2019s shares fell 5.8% to $185.72. The ruling came on a day when Apple shares already were trading lower because of concerns over a full-blown U.S.-China trade war.  The Cupertino, California-based technology company, backed by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration in the case, argued that it was only acting as an agent for app developers, who set their own prices and pay Apple\u2019s commission.  Monday\u2019s ruling, written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, did not resolve the merits of the claim against Apple. But if the plaintiffs win at trial, Mark Rifkin, a lawyer representing them, said that \u201cthe overcharges paid by consumers since Apple\u2019s monopoly began will be measured in the billions of dollars.\u201d  In a statement, Apple said, \u201cWe\u2019re confident we will prevail when the facts are presented and that the App Store is not a monopoly by any metric.\u201d  The dispute hinged in part on how the justices would apply a 1977 Supreme Court precedent. In that case, the court limited damages for anti-competitive conduct to those directly overcharged rather than indirect victims who paid an overcharge passed on by others.  Kavanaugh explained from the bench that the 1977 precedent was \u201cnot a get-out-of-court-free card for monopolistic retailers,\u201d an apparent allusion to the popular board game Monopoly.  \u201cApple\u2019s theory would provide a roadmap for monopolistic retailers to structure transactions with manufacturers or suppliers so as to evade antitrust claims by consumers and thereby thwart effective antitrust enforcement,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote in the ruling.  FILE PHOTO: Customers walk past an Apple logo inside of an Apple store at Grand Central Station in New York, U.S., August 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  Apple has said the consumers were indirect purchasers, at best, because any overcharge would be passed on to them by developers. The iPhone users who sued countered that they pay Apple - not an app developer - whenever buying an app from the App Store, and were therefore direct victims of the overcharges.  Siding with the consumers, Kavanaugh, a conservative appointed by Trump, joined the court\u2019s four liberal justices to rule against Apple.  Dissenting from the decision, conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, said the decision is \u201cnot how antitrust law is supposed to work\u201d because it gives a green light to the exact type of case that the court had previously prohibited. Gorsuch also was appointed by Trump.  SERVICES BUSINESS  Apple had avoided much of the antitrust scrutiny faced by other technology firms including Facebook, largely by arguing that it does not have a dominant position in the many markets in which it operates, from smart phones and laptops to streaming music services. The lawsuit, along with complaints over App Store policies to European officials from rivals such as streaming music Spotify, could draw Apple into the broader public debate over the market power of large tech companies.  The legal setback for Apple comes as investors are looking to the company\u2019s services business, including its App Store, to fuel growth as iPhone sales slow.  Rifkin said he was gratified by the court\u2019s decision, which \u201creaffirmed the straightforward principle that consumers who purchase a monopolized product directly from the alleged monopolist may sue the monopolist to recover the full amount of the overcharge they are forced to pay by reason of the monopoly.\u201d  Apple said in its statement, \u201cDevelopers set the price they want to charge for their app and Apple has no role in that. The vast majority of apps on the App Store are free and Apple gets nothing from them.\u201d  The ruling could lead to other lawsuits against tech companies that act as platforms for other products or services. Apple had warned that this could pose a threat to e-commerce, a rapidly expanding segment of the U.S. economy worth hundreds of billions of dollars in annual sales.  The plaintiffs, including lead plaintiff Robert Pepper of Chicago, filed the suit in a California federal court in 2011, claiming Apple\u2019s monopoly leads to inflated prices compared to if apps were available from other sources. They were supported by 30 state attorneys general, including from Texas, California and New York.  Apple, also backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business group, had sought to dismiss the case, arguing the plaintiffs lacked the required legal standing to sue.  After a federal judge in Oakland threw out the suit, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived it in 2017, finding that Apple was a distributor that sold iPhone apps directly to consumers.","945":"FILE PHOTO: Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, waves to attendees during an Apple special event at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California, U.S., March 25, 2019.

Cook, speaking in an interview with CBS News that aired on Tuesday, said Apple controlled a moderate share of the market but was not too big, and disagreed with calls from some U.S. politicians that the company be broken up.  \u201cWith size, I think scrutiny is fair. I think we should be scrutinized,\u201d he said. But, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody reasonable is gonna come to the conclusion that Apple\u2019s a monopoly.\u201d  On Monday, sources told Reuters said U.S. authorities were preparing to launch what could be a wide-ranging probe with oversight divided between the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. U.S. officials must still decide whether to open formal investigations.  Shares of Apple and other tech giants - Facebook Inc, Google owner Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc - fell on Monday following news of the probe. Their shares were all up slightly in premarket trading on Tuesday.  Technology companies have faced increased scrutiny on a range of issues from privacy and their impact in the 2016 election to advertising and their effect on the marketplace.  U.S. President Donald Trump has urged closer examination of social media companies and Google, accusing them - without offering evidence - of suppressing conservative voices online. He has also repeatedly slammed Amazon, whose CEO, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post, another target of Trump\u2019s ire over its news coverage of him and his administration.  Congress has weighed in with hearings on big tech. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Monday welcomed potential federal investigations.","946":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc, Alphabet Inc\u2019s YouTube, Facebook Inc and Spotify all took down podcasts and channels from U.S. conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, saying on Monday that the Infowars author had broken community standards.  The sweeping moves are the broadest actions yet by internet companies that previously have suspended or removed some of the conspiracy-driven content produced by Infowars.  Since founding Infowars in 1999, Jones has built a vast audience. Among the theories he has promoted is that the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington were staged by the government.  Facebook said it removed Alex Jones pages \u201cfor glorifying violence, which violates our graphic violence policy, and using dehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants, which violates our hate speech policies.\u201d  The Infowars app remained available on the app stores hosted by Apple and Alphabet\u2019s Google Play, however, while Twitter Inc said that Infowars accounts were not currently in violation of its rules.  Alphabet and Apple did not immediately respond to questions about why the app remained available on their platforms.  Infowars editor-at-large Paul Joseph Watson said in a tweet here that the broad take-downs amounted to censorship and were intended to help Democrats in congressional elections due in November.

REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  \u201cInfowars is widely credited with having played a key role in electing Donald Trump. By banning Infowars, big tech is engaging in election meddling just three months before crucial mid-terms,\u201d Watson wrote on the Infowars website.  Neither Jones nor a representative for Infowars was available for additional comment. None of the companies that took down the content commented on whether they had coordinated their actions.  The Alex Jones Channel on YouTube on Monday displayed a banner saying the account had been terminated for violating community guidelines, and a spokesperson added by email that repeated violation of policies such as those prohibiting hate speech and harassment led to termination of accounts.  Apple deleted most Infowars podcasts and a spokeswoman said in a statement that the company \u201cdoes not tolerate hate speech\u201d and publishes guidelines that developers and publishers must follow.  \u201cPodcasts that violate these guidelines are removed from our directory making them no longer searchable or available for download or streaming,\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cWe believe in representing a wide range of views, so long as people are respectful to those with differing opinions.\u201d  Only one program provided by Infowars, \u201cRealNews with David Knight,\u201d remained on Apple\u2019s podcasts platforms on Monday. BuzzFeed earlier reported that Apple had removed the library for five of Jones\u2019s six Infowars podcasts, including the shows \u201cWar Room\u201d and the daily \u201cThe Alex Jones Show.\u201d  Twitter said in an email that content posted to other websites often was not put on Twitter and that tweets from Infowars typically were replied to by people rebutting and challenging it. If Infowars violates Twitter rules in the future, it will take action, it added.  Music and podcast company Spotify said on Monday that it had now removed all of Jones\u2019s Infowars programs from its platform, after last week removing some programs.  A representative said that Spotify took seriously reports of hate content. \u201cDue to repeated violations of Spotify\u2019s prohibited content policies, The Alex Jones Show has lost access to the Spotify platform,\u201d the representative said.  In late July, Facebook had suspended Jones\u2019s personal profile for 30 days for what the company said was bullying and hate speech.  Jones has also promoted a theory that the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre was faked by left-wing forces to promote gun control. The shooting left 26 children and adults dead at a Connecticut elementary school.  He is being sued in Texas by two Sandy Hook parents, seeking at least $1 million, claiming that they have been the subject of harassment driven by his programs.","947":"VIENNA (Reuters) - Apple AAPL.O supplier AMS AMS.S beat expectations with a 41% jump in third-quarter revenue on Tuesday and forecast further strong demand for its optical sensors from smartphone makers as it takes aim at a takeover of German lighting maker Osram OSRn.DE.  FILE PHOTO: Employees of Austrian sensor specialist AMS work in their factory in Unterpremstaetten, Austria October 3, 2019.

AMS\u2019 Swiss-listed shares, which gapped higher at the open, were down 0.9% at 0810 GMT.  Its adjusted EBIT margin was 28% and AMS said it expected to at least maintain this level in the fourth quarter.  Operating cash flow increased more than threefold to $299 million, and AMS\u2019s backlog stood at $253.1 million end-September.  \u201cAMS delivered even stronger results than expected and the outlook for the fourth-quarter also confirms the very solid business momentum not just with Apple but also the Android ecosystem,\u201d Vontobel analysts said in a note to clients.  AMS\u2019s main revenue source is optical sensors and Apple, its top customer, uses the Austrian firm\u2019s 3D facial recognition technology in its latest iPhones.  Apple accounts for around 40% of group revenue, analysts estimate.  CEO Alexander Everke\u2019s next aim is a takeover of Osram to combine AMS\u2019s expertise in sensors with the German firm\u2019s lighting know-how.  Everke\u2019s first attempt failed this month as AMS secured 51.6% support from Osram shareholders, short of the required 62.5%.  Under a new bid, its offer price stays at 41 euros per share, valuing Osram at 4.6 billion euros ($5.1 billion), but with a lowered acceptance rate of 55%.  Private equity groups Bain and Advent informed Osram on Friday that they would refrain from a takeover bid for the time being, and AMS hopes that will convince investors to tender their shares.  But sources familiar with the groups\u2019 thinking told Reuters on Sunday that they were waiting in the wings and could revive their approach if AMS\u2019s bid failed.  AMS plans to take on billions of new debt to take over Osram.  AMS \u201cfeels confident about the new takeover offer for Osram... as it is financially attractive, strategically compelling and the viable option for Osram shareholders,\u201d it said.  Subject to the German financial watchdog Bafin\u2019s approval, the offer period is expected to begin this month, AMS said.  Last year the company was hit by production delays and initially slow demand for Apple's iPhone X series last year, but this year has been positive with iPhone 11 models and higher demand from Android phone makers including Samsung 005930.KS, and China's Xiaomi 1810.HK and Huawei .","948":"(Repeats Friday story with no changes to text) By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are locked in a tight race to become the second publicly-listed U.S. company to reach a $1 trillion stock market value after Apple became the first to touch the 13-digit milestone. Wall Street's optimism about last year's 10th anniversary iPhone, coupled with record share buybacks, have propelled Apple's stock 34 percent higher over the past 12 months, pushing the company's stock market value above $1 trillion on Thursday. The Cupertino, California company's shares added another 0.3 percent on Friday, putting its market capitalization at $1.005 trillion. Apple's 12-month gain is far better than the S&P 500's 14 percent increase over the past year, but it pales beside Amazon's astounding 85 percent surge, propelled by the online retailer's and cloud computing heavyweight's scorchingly fast revenue and profit growth. Amazon is now the second-largest publicly-listed U.S. company, with a market capitalization of $889 billion, followed closely by Alphabet and Microsoft, at $856 billion and $830 billion respectively. Google-owner Alphabet's stock has risen 32 percent over the past 12 months, and is up nearly 18 percent in 2018. Together with Facebook, the five largest U.S. companies account for 15 percent of the S&P 500. Synovus Trust portfolio manager Dan Morgan said he owns shares of Amazon mostly because of its dominance of the cloud computing industry, a business that grew 42 percent in the June quarter and provided most of Amazon's operating profits. \"Of the three companies, I'd say Amazon will get to $1 trillion next,\" Morgan said. Average analyst price targets put Apple's stock market value at $1.05 trillion, Amazon at $1.02 trillion, Alphabet at $970 billion and Microsoft at $953 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. To be sure, past stock gains are not a reliable predictor of future performance, and the surge in Amazon shares in recent years has been exceptional by most standards. But Amazon's market capitalization would overtake Apple's later in 2018 if both companies shares were to continue their 12-month growth pace.

After becoming the first $1 trillion publicly-listed U.S. company on Thursday, Apple last traded up 0.4 percent at $208.22 after falling as low as $205.48 and rising as high as $208.74.  Daniel Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus Trust in Atlanta, said Apple\u2019s lukewarm start on Friday was a temporary pause for the stock rather than a sign it could lose ground.  \u201cIt\u2019s like the horse that crosses the finish line and says I\u2019m totally wiped out,\u201d said Morgan whose firm holds more than 200,000 shares in Apple.  \u201cThere was a strong earnings report on Tuesday. All the enthusiasm around the $1 trillion market capitalization, both those things have just exhausted the current trading in Apple. And it\u2019s Friday. The whole week was engulfed by Apple,\u201d he said.  Apple still looks relatively cheap even with a trillion dollar valuation.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc will pay $113 million to settle allegations from 33 U.S. states and the District of Columbia that it slowed down iPhones to mask battery issues and get users to purchase new devices, state officials announced on Wednesday.  FILE PHOTO: A man holds an iPhone 6 in a mobile phone shop in Moscow, Russia, September 26, 2014. REUTERS\/Maxim Shemetov\/File Photo  The deal with a coalition led by Arizona, Arkansas and Indiana is separate from a proposed settlement Apple reached in March to pay affected iPhone owners up to $500 million to stem a class action.  Apple in 2016 quietly updated software on models of the iPhone 6, 7 and SE to throttle chip speeds so that aging batteries on the devices would not send power spikes to the phone\u2019s processor and cause it to unexpectedly shut down. States contended Apple acted deceptively and should have replaced batteries or disclosed the issue.  Millions of users were affected by power shutoffs, according to an Arizona court filing.  \u201cMy colleagues and I are trying to get the attention of these big tech companies, and you would hope a multimillion-dollar judgment with more than 30 states will get their attention,\u201d Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said in an interview.  \u201cCompanies cannot be disingenuous and conceal things,\u201d he added.  Apple, which has denied wrongdoing, declined to comment on the settlement.  Apple also agreed for the next three years to provide \u201ctruthful information\u201d about iPhone power management across its website, software update notes and iPhone settings. Arizona said Apple\u2019s present disclosures and options are sufficient. The settlement with states is subject to court approval.  The multistate investigation into Apple, which Reuters first reported in July, is part of a wave of probes into the world\u2019s biggest technology providers.  Republican attorneys general in 11 U.S. states last month joined the U.S. Justice Department in an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, and large, bipartisan groups of attorneys general have ongoing investigations into Google and Facebook Inc over potentially deceptive and anticompetitive practices.  Apple acknowledged its update reduced power demands after researchers found unusual slowdowns in 2017. The company publicly apologized and slashed prices on battery replacements.  The settlement includes $5 million to Arizona, $24.6 million to Apple\u2019s home state of California and $7.6 million to Texas. The latter two states have the nation\u2019s Nos. 1 and 2 affected iPhone user bases. Brnovich said the penalty in his state would help fund more investigations into tech and other companies.","955":"(Adds gold, oil settlement prices, new comments)  * Apple temporarily closes store due to rising coronavirus cases  * Gold gains on safe-haven demand, rises above $1,750  * Dollar gains, bond yields slide on haven demand  * Oil trims gains  NEW YORK, June 19 (Reuters) - Demand for safe havens rose and global equity markets turned south on Friday after Apple Inc said it would temporarily shut 11 U.S. stores as coronavirus cases continue to rise, rekindling fears of a deadly second wave of the pandemic.  News of Apple\u2019s move involving stores in Florida, Arizona, South Carolina and North Carolina doused hopes for a quick economic recovery that had spurred risk appetite earlier in the day, driving up European and U.S. stocks about 1%.

The mayhem at the Capitol forced Congress to temporarily postpone a session to certify Biden\u2019s victory.  The chaotic scenes unfolded after Trump, who before the election refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he lost, addressed thousands of supporters near the White House, repeating unfounded claims that the election was stolen from him due to widespread fraud and irregularities.

Researchers hope the technology can assist in early detection of atrial fibrillation, the most common form of irregular heart beat. Patients with untreated AF are five times more likely to have a stroke.  Results of the largest AF screening and detection study, involving over 400,000 Apple Watch users who were invited to participate, were presented on Saturday at the American College of Cardiology meeting in New Orleans.  Of the 400,000 participants, 0.5 percent, or about 2,000 subjects, received notifications of an irregular pulse. Those people were sent an ECG (electrocardiography) patch to wear for subsequent detection of atrial fibrillation episodes.  A third of those whose watches detected an irregular pulse were confirmed to have atrial fibrillation using the ECG technology, researchers said.  Some 84 percent of the irregular pulse notifications were later confirmed to have been AF episodes, data showed.  \u201cThe physician can use the information from the study, combine it with their assessment ... and then guide clinical decisions around what to do with an alert,\u201d said Dr. Marco Perez, one of the study\u2019s lead investigators from Stanford School of Medicine.  The study also found that 57 percent of participants who received an alert on their watch sought medical attention.  For Apple, the data provides firepower as it pushes into healthcare. Its new Series 4 Watch, which became available only after the study began so was not used, has the ability to take an electrocardiogram to detect heart problems and required clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  Dr. Deepak Bhatt, a cardiologist from Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston who was not involved in the trial, called it an important study as use of this type of wearable technology is only going to become more prevalent.  \u201cThe study is an important first step in figuring out how can we use these technologies in a way that\u2019s evidence based,\u201d he said.  Researchers urged caution by doctors in using data from consumer devices when treating patients. But they also see great future potential for this type of technology.  \u201cAtrial fibrillation is just the beginning, as this study opens the door to further research into wearable technologies and how they might be used to prevent disease before it strikes,\u201d said Lloyd Minor, dean of Stanford School of Medicine.","958":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc was sued on Thursday by the creator of a once-popular app store that accused the iPhone maker of illegally monopolizing software distribution on its own operating system.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  Cydia, which was created in 2008, said Apple has \u201cillegally squashed all competition\u201d for its App Store, depriving consumers of the ability to choose where to obtain iOS apps and developers from choosing which distributors to use.  The complaint filed in the Oakland, California federal court is the latest case accusing Apple of exploiting market dominance at the expense of rivals such as Cydia, which said it is on the verge of closing and a possible bankruptcy.  Apple, based in Cupertino, California, said in an email it will review the lawsuit and does not monopolize any market.  It also said that for security reasons it discourages consumers from trying to unlock their iPhones, in a process called \u201cjailbreaking,\u201d to install unauthorized software.  The main rival to iOS is Google\u2019s Android operating system, which is used in smartphones from such rivals as Samsung Electronics Co.  Cydia, also known as SaurikIT, was created by software engineer Jay Freeman, and is seeking unspecified damages.  It is represented by the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, which has represented Samsung against Apple in patent litigation.  Apple has a market value exceeding $2 trillion.  Other antitrust challenges it faces include a lawsuit filed in August by Epic Games, which makes the Fortnite video game.  Epic accused Apple of illegally removing Fortnite from its App Store because Epic wanted to use its own payment system rather than let Apple take 30% commissions on purchases. That case could go to trial in May 2021.  Last month, Apple said it would reduce commissions to 15% from 30% for developers generating $1 million or less of proceeds from App Store sales.

Apple announced the labels, which seek to quickly convey information about several categories of data collection and somewhat resemble the nutrition labels on food products, at a developer conference in June. It started requiring developers to provide information for the labels last week as part of the review process for releasing or updating apps.  The labels will be introduced over time as developers submit their apps for approval to Apple, and users will see them before downloading or update an app. Apple will require disclosures of when apps gather data for what it deems \u201ctracking\u201d of users across unrelated apps or websites.  Developers will be able to offer explanations for the data collection, but users will have to click through two sets of links to see the explanation. Developers are responsible for the accuracy of the information, but Apple said compliance will be checked during the app review process, during random audits and in response to complaints.  The labels are part of a broader set of changes Apple rolled out this year to introduce more notifications and permission requirements for data collection on its devices.  A requirement for new notifications to users before any use of a digital advertising identifier prompted an outcry from companies such as Facebook Inc. Many digital advertisers said users would likely decline to have their data collected because of the new notification rule.  The rule was set to go into effect this year, but Apple said it would delay implementation until early 2021 to give developers more time to make changes to their apps.","960":"Sept 29 (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday granted CEO Tim Cook 333,987 restricted stock units, in his first grant since 2011.  \u201cTim has brought unparalleled innovation and focus to his role as CEO and demonstrated what it means to lead with values and integrity,\u201d Apple\u2019s board of directors said in statement. \u201cFor the first time in nearly a decade, we are awarding Tim a new stock grant that will vest over time in recognition of his outstanding leadership and with great optimism for Apple\u2019s future as he carries these efforts forward.\u201d  Apple\u2019s stock closed at $114.09 on Tuesday.

REUTERS\/Tatyana Makeyeva  AMS shares hit a 20-month low on Tuesday after some analysts questioned whether the chipmaker specializing in sensors could achieve its $2.7 billion 2019 revenue target amid signs of weakening chip demand.  \u201cFourth-quarter guidance is disappointing,\u201d UBS said in a note, while Liberum analysts said they were skeptical about AMS meeting its 2019 revenue target and 2020 operating margin goal.  AMS, which has invested heavily in research and development and in production expansion, is now tackling underutilized facilities, increasing competition and its reliance on Apple.  Analysts forecast that to reach its 2019 revenue target, AMS needs two or three significant new deals, something that the company\u2019s chief executive Alexander Everke said was achievable.  \u201cWe have multiple wins and we do see that growth that you have just described. All the investments we have done... support the growth we indicated for 2019,\u201d Everke told an analyst call.  AMS said its third-quarter EBIT (earnings before interest and taxation) rose to $60.2 million, or 13 percent of revenue, from $40.5 million last year thanks to increasing production volumes for a recently launched global smartphone platform.  While it does not identify its customers, this was taken as a reference to Apple, which analysts estimate accounts for around 40 percent of AMS sales.  After a delay of several months, production for Apple appears on track and analysts estimate that AMS\u2019s facial recognition sensors are in all three newly launched iPhones.  FACING THE WORLD  To reduce its Apple dependency, AMS has been working on selling sensors to Android customers. This has become more important after the U.S. tech giant struck a $600 million deal with German rival Dialog Semiconductors this month.  Swiss-listed AMS also announced new deals on Monday, including two with Asian smartphone producers for its Android time-of-flight solutions, a method where cameras capture a whole scene in three dimensions with a dedicated image sensor.  AMS also said it has started to produce 3D face recognition sensors for two Android customers, including China's Xiaomi 1810.HK, the fourth-biggest smartphone maker.  Huawei\u2019s [HWT.UL] new Mate20 Pro phones also use AMS sensors for facial recognition, analysts say, adding the second-biggest smartphone maker to the AMS customer list.  AMS said it had secured a deal for OLED-display sensors, which are thinner and more flexible than LEDs, with a major Asian manufacturer, and is working on sensors that are capable of scanning surroundings in 3D, so-called world-facing 3D sensors, for a major smartphone manufacturer.  After a strategic review, AMS said it plans to reduce its focus on environmental sensors, which detect temperature or moisture, but did not say whether this business would be sold.  That leaves it with three main businesses: optical sensors, such as the ones used in the new iPhones, image sensors for applications in self-driving cars and audio sensors.","962":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Taiwanese firms eyeing investment in India want government support on land and labour issues, a senior Taiwan trade official said on Tuesday, following a violent protest at Wistron Corp\u2019s iPhone manufacturing facility on the outskirts of Indian tech hub Bengaluru.

Shipments for Apple's iPhones decreased about 21% year-on-year to 27.5 million. This comes as the domestic market for smartphones shrank 15% annually, according to the report bit.ly\/2vm4z0T released on Tuesday.  Growth in smartphone sales stagnated in 2018 and 2019 as consumers postponed purchases, opting to wait for companies to release more 5G-enabled models. Huawei has already released four of these in China, while Xiaomi Corp 1810.HK has released two.  Other Chinese Android makers are racing to release 5G phones in the hope that consumers will upgrade their handsets as China rolls out its 5G network to most big cities this year.  Xiaomi\u2019s full-year shipments fell about 21% in 2019. Rivals Oppo and Vivo dropped 17% and 19%, respectively, over the same time period.  Huawei remains at the center of U.S.-China tensions. Last year, Washington imposed restrictions on the handset maker that barred American suppliers from selling goods and services to it, citing national security concerns. Huawei has denied these charges.  But the restrictions have had little impact on its ability to sell phones domestically. However, losing access to Google\u2019s services had affected the company\u2019s business overseas.  The sanctions in fact helped boost Huawei\u2019s sales in China on the back of patriotic consumer purchases. The company\u2019s aggressive marketing has helped as well.  Huawei\u2019s fortunes picked up as iPhone sales lagged in 2017 and 2018, following a peak in the previous years. Last year, Apple offered discounts on iPhones to boost sales, a move that Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook later said was successful.  Canalys estimates iPhone sales fell 12% in the quarter ended Dec. 31. In the preceding quarter, sales had fallen 28%.  However, this year could be a better one for Apple, with the company expected to launch its first 5G-enabled iPhone.  According to Nicole Peng, who tracks China\u2019s smartphone sector at Canalys, the company\u2019s latest iPhone 11 model is the best-selling 4G device in China.

The weak forecast by the world\u2019s most valuable technology company sent shares down as much as 4.3 percent to $212.46 in after-hours trading, taking roughly $40 billion off Apple\u2019s market value of more than $1 trillion at market close Thursday.  The tech sector has taken a beating on Wall Street over the last month and Apple\u2019s weak forecast fed into the same investor fears that have sent shares of Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc tumbling.  Apple said it expects between $89 billion and $93 billion in revenue for its fiscal first quarter ending in December, with a midpoint of $91 billion coming in below Wall Street expectations of $93 billion, according Refinitiv data.  For the quarter ended in September, Apple brought in $62.9 billion in revenue and $2.91 per share in profits, beating expectations of $61.5 billion and $2.79, respectively.  In an interview with Reuters, Cook said some of the forecast was explained by Apple releasing its top-end iPhone models, the XS and XS Max, in the fiscal fourth quarter. Cook also said foreign exchange rates would have a $2 billion negative impact on Apple\u2019s sales forecast.  Apple was unsure whether it can make enough new iPhones, Apple Watches, iPads and Mac models it released in recent weeks, Cook told Reuters. Apple is widely expanding the use of its facial recognition unlocking system in iPhones and iPads, which uses special lasers that are still produced by only a handful of suppliers.  Cook said that Apple is \u201cseeing some macroeconomic weakness in some of the emerging markets,\u201d without specifying which ones.  But Cook stressed that Apple was happy with its performance in China, where revenue grew 16 percent to $11.4 billion, the fifth quarter in a row the company has had double-digit growth in the region.  Apple\u2019s cautious forecast could accelerate investor fears that have in turn erased stock market gains for much of the year. At market close on Thursday, Apple shares were up more than 25 percent for the year - supported by purchases by Warren Buffett and a $100 billion share buy-back program - while the Nasdaq Composite Index is nearly flat for the year.  \u201cI think they\u2019ve always been fairly conservative with the guidance they\u2019ve given out,\u201d said Trip Miller, managing partner at Apple shareholder Gullane Capital Partners. \u201cI hope that\u2019s the case here.\u201d  Apple sold 46.9 million iPhones in the fiscal fourth quarter, missing analyst expectations of 47.5 million iPhones, according to FactSet. But the average selling price of iPhones was $793, well above analyst estimates of $750.78, according to FactSet.  Apple said revenue from services, which includes iCloud, the App Store and Apple Music, reached $10 billion, in line with analyst estimates. Apple investors have been increasingly focused on growth in the company\u2019s services business as growth in the global market for smartphones levels off in terms of unit sales.  Apple forecast a tax rate of 16.5 percent for the December quarter, above analyst expectations of 15.9 percent, according to data from Refinitiv.  \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a minimum tax on foreign earnings coming from the new tax legislation\u201d passed in the United States, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters.

With a mountain of overseas cash freed up by last year\u2019s sweeping U.S. corporate tax cuts, Apple\u2019s share repurchases in the first half of calendar 2018 exceed the stock market value of almost three quarters of the companies in the S&P 500, including Ford Motor Co, Delta Air Lines Inc and Twitter Inc .  Apple\u2019s share repurchases in the June quarter were only eclipsed in the history of the S&P 500 by Apple repurchasing $22.8 billion of its shares in the prior quarter, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices analyst Howard Silverblatt.  The recent pace of Apple\u2019s buybacks, disclosed in a quarterly report that beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations, could help support the iPhone maker\u2019s stock as investors worry that some high-flying technology companies have become too expensive.  Confidence top-shelf technology and consumer stocks has been shaken in recent days following poor results from Facebook Inc and Netflix Inc.  Apple said in May it was adding $100 billion to its budget for buybacks. Its stock is up 16 percent in 2018, compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 5 percent rise.  \u201cI see the buybacks as a major determinant of near-term price appreciation,\u201d said D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Thomas Forte.  Apple reported strong quarterly revenue and profits in its report after the bell, driven by sales of higher-priced iPhones and from services like the App Store.  Its stock rose 3.7 percent in extended trade to $197.34, a record high, putting its market capitalization at $954 billion, based on Apple\u2019s share count at the end of the quarter. Apple is tickling at becoming the first publicly listed U.S. company valued at $1 trillion.  However, Apple\u2019s quarterly filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, expected on Wednesday, might reveal that it further reduced its share count since the end of the quarter, which would mean its market capitalization is lower.  Apple also paid $3.7 billion in dividends during the quarter, bringing its total in the first half of calendar 2018 to $6.9 billion, the company said.  The decision to turn over record amounts of cash to shareholders was a direct result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed by Republican lawmakers in December.","970":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc shares AAPL.O rose 4.4% on Wednesday, after the company calmed Wall Street nerves with an improvement in sales in China and as several brokerages predicted a boost from its services business and the launch of new iPhones in the second half of 2019.

Levoff faces one count of securities fraud, carrying a maximum 20-year prison term and a $5 million fine.  He is expected to appear on Feb. 20 in a federal court in Newark, New Jersey.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil charges in the case, one of the rare instances of a senior lawyer at a major U.S. company being implicated in a crime.  \u201cLevoff\u2019s alleged exploitation of his access to Apple\u2019s financial information was particularly egregious given his responsibility for implementing the company\u2019s insider trading compliance policy,\u201d Antonia Chion, associate director of the SEC\u2019s enforcement division, said in a statement.

Apple said in a statement it had terminated Levoff after an internal probe, and that it trains employees about their legal obligations.  Authorities said Levoff reported to Apple\u2019s general counsel and has been a corporate officer of every major subsidiary of the Cupertino, California-based company.  As co-chairman of Apple\u2019s disclosure committee, Levoff helped Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and his predecessor, Steve Jobs, ensure the timeliness, accuracy and proper oversight of company disclosures, including financial results, according to authorities.  Despite this, prosecutors said Levoff bought and sold more than $14 million of Apple stock, including $10 million in July 2015 alone, after being given draft earnings materials but before the results were made public.  Authorities said Levoff knew or should have known he was breaking the law, citing a February 2011 email where he warned employees not to trade on material nonpublic information.  The charges against Levoff were filed in New Jersey, where authorities said servers were located for firms that handled Levoff\u2019s illegal trades.  The cases are U.S. v.

The so-called Phase One deal announced, but still not signed, on Friday suspends the planned imposition of new 15% tariffs on Sunday that would have hit $160 billion in Chinese consumer goods just weeks before Christmas, including $115 billion worth of iPhones, laptops and other electronics.  The deal would also see the United States reduce existing tariffs on other goods. China has agreed to boost imports of U.S. energy, pharmaceutical and agricultural products, although Chinese officials offered no details on the amount of U.S. goods Beijing had agreed to buy.  If it is signed, Trump\u2019s long-awaited deal will be a relief to Apple, among the U.S. companies with the most to lose in the trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies, along with chipmakers who make the components in its devices, which are mostly made in China.  \u201cThe Street has been laser focused on this additional 15% next round of tariffs and we believe this ultimately signals a green light for tech stocks heading into year end with the impending $160 billion tariff no longer a near-term concern,\u201d Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note on Friday.  Ives estimated that the tariffs that would have hit iPhone imports on Sunday would have clipped about 4%, or 50 cents, off of Apple\u2019s 2020 earnings per share.  Even amid trade uncertainty, Apple surged over 70% this year to all-time highs on broad investor confidence in recent months that Washington and Beijing would eventually strike a deal. Apple\u2019s stock has also benefited from progress increasing its services revenue as it diversifies from declining iPhone sales.  Confidence the trade war would be settled has also pushed the S&P 500 up 26% in 2019 and fueled a 44% rally in the information technology sub-index.  Still, Investors are divided over whether Trump\u2019s trade deal is fully priced into the market, or whether shares of Apple, its suppliers, like Qorvo and Skyworks Solutions , and other U.S. technology and trade-sensitive stocks have room to rise.  The S&P 500 edged up 0.01% on Friday to close at its second record high in two days, while Apple rose 1.36% to an all-time high. Chip stocks including Qorvo and Advanced Micro Devices sold off from recent record highs.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see some profit-taking,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, Chief Investment Strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. \u201cOn the other hand, the deal could really give corporate management better visibility into the economic outlook, and help them start spending again.\u201d  Reflecting Wall Street\u2019s mostly upbeat view toward Apple, BofA Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan on Wednesday raised his price target on the company, predicting the eventual rollout of 5G would drive three years of robust iPhone sales.  The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has surged 56% in 2019, as the rollout of 5G wireless technology appeared likely to end a downturn in global chip demand and on confidence the trade war would be resolved. The global chip market is set to recover by 5.9% in 2020 after shrinking 12.8% this year, according to a forecast by World Semiconductor Trade Statistics.  But gains in technology stocks have stretched their earnings multiples, increasing the risk should their bottom lines not grow next year as much as expected, or should Trump\u2019s trade deal sour.

REUTERS\/Moritz Hager  Apple, which analysts estimate is responsible for half of AMS revenue, is winding down production of its iPhone X line before gearing up for new products in the autumn. Although that transition was widely expected, the impact on AMS is magnified by the U.S. company\u2019s delays in finalizing parts specifications.  AMS sensors are used by Apple to deliver face-recognition features that make its flagship iPhone X stand out from rival smartphones and the Austrian company is widely expected to win follow-on contracts for the next iPhones and iPads.  \u201cDue to these product transitions and product changes in a major consumer program preventing pre-production of parts, AMS also expects a significant under-utilization of capacity,\u201d the company said.  It had reported late on Monday that first-quarter sales were toward the lower end of its previous guidance range and delivered its warning about the current quarter.  Shares in the chipmaker suffered their biggest daily decline in two years on Tuesday before mounting a partial recovery after AMS executives told investors results would bounce back in the second half once the key customer, which it declined to name, okayed new product specifications.  By 1139 GMT Zurich-listed shares in AMS were down 9.1 percent at 86.90 Swiss francs, with other Apple suppliers also taking a hit.  Dialog Semiconductor, which supplies power management chips to Apple, fell 5.4 percent while STMicro, another Apple sensor chip supplier, fell as much as 4 percent in early trading before recovering losses to trade 1 percent down.  MARGINS BLOW  AMS said it expected second-quarter sales to drop to between $220 million and $250 million, roughly half the $452.7 million in sales it posted for the first three months of 2018.  It added that the reduced utilization of capacity at its biggest plant in Singapore will hit profit margins.  AMS also confirmed its mid-term growth and profitability guidance, aiming for a 60 percent compound annual growth rate between 2016 and 2019, combined with an adjusted margin target of 30 percent from 2019 onwards.  Executives at the company emphasized that there are no plans to lay off factory employees because the key customer remains committed to using AMS products. The order shortfall is expected to reverse in the second half of 2018 as the customer ramps up its purchasing.  \u201cThe imminent end of life for iPhone X is leading to a deeper trough than the most cautious of estimates,\u201d Barclays analyst Andrew Gardiner said in a research note to clients.

A screen displaying an advertisement for iPhone 11 Pro is seen outside an Apple store in Beijing, China October 31, 2019. REUTERS\/Florence Lo  Apple said sales in greater China fell 2.4% in its fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, a far cry from the 27% drop it saw in the first quarter this year - a fact that Chief Executive Tim Cook played up on the company\u2019s post-earnings call on Wednesday.  A confluence of things helped.  The company priced the cheapest variant of its iPhone 11 at $50 less than the last generation model, even as it pulled in the launch of the new models by a month versus last year, which helped sales in the September quarter.  This followed a year of heavy discounting on older iPhone models as Apple gave resellers flexibility to cut prices, contrary to past practice. As well, the company recently introduced installment-based payment plans to push sales in a weaker economy and a contracting smartphone market.  \u201cApple\u2019s new low-price strategy in China had an extremely large impact,\u201d said James Yan, who tracks China\u2019s smartphone market at Counterpoint Research.  But the company is expected to launch a 5G-enabled smartphone only next year, which analysts say is a problem when Huawei, China\u2019s top smartphone maker, launched its first 5G phone in June - the Mate 20 X, priced at 6,199 yuan ($901).  Smaller phonemakers including Xiaomi have quickly followed suit as China\u2019s state-owned carriers are set to launch 5G services on Friday, effectively bringing ultra-fast web connectivity to the masses.  Yan expects cheaper 5G devices from these companies to flood the market in China next year, pushing down Apple\u2019s sales.  Huawei cornered the lion\u2019s share of the China market in the July-September period, according to market research firm Canalys, leaving Apple toward the bottom of the pile.  TIMING MATTERS  The September quarter was indeed an improvement for Apple in China.  Services revenue - which the company has been touting as a growth driver as iPhone volumes plateau - rose by double digits in China as more iPhone users downloaded games on the App store, after regulators continued to approve games following a months-long ban.  Chinese authorities approved 291 domestic and imported titles for in-app purchases in July-September, pushing up downloads of popular titles including Tencent\u2019s Battle Through The Heavens and NetEase\u2019s Pro Evolution Soccer.  Nicole Peng, who tracks China\u2019s smartphone industry at Canalys, said the rise in Apple\u2019s services revenue is also testament to the fact that Chinese consumers are getting more used to paying for online content.  \u201cEven on Android and WeChat, a lot more content requires users to pay membership or subscription fees,\u201d she said.  Peng also noted that an option to trade-in older models was featured more prominently on Apple\u2019s China website this year and retail staff have been pushing the service to customers.  In the past, faced with a trade-in choice, \u201cChinese consumers would ask, \u2018Why would I want to trade in my phone? Are you saying I don\u2019t have enough money to buy it?\u2019\u201d she said.  But domestic resellers such as Aihuishou, Huishoubao and Alibaba\u2019s used-goods site Xianyu, have helped consumers who might have switched to cheaper Android phones understand that the cost of an iPhone can be offset.  \u201cFor Apple, it was the right time to get these better-educated customers to use their trade-in services.\u201d","985":"* Boeing down for second session, weighs on airlines  * Apple gains after announcing March 25 event  * Dow dips 0.3 pct, S&P 500 up 0.4 pct, Nasdaq rises 0.6 pct (Updates to late afternoon)  NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose on Tuesday after tame inflation data supported the Federal Reserve\u2019s dovish stance on rate hikes, but the Dow was down as Boeing\u2019s shares extended sharp losses from the day before.

And services revenue, which includes sales from iCloud, the App Store and other businesses, reached $11.45 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $11.32 billion, according to FactSet.  Apple has wrestled with a slowdown in iPhone sales in key markets such as China and saw its first ever year-over-year decline in iPhone revenue for the holiday shopping season.  The slowdown stemmed in part from the iPhone\u2019s high cost and competition from rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, Xiaomi Corp, Oppo and Vivo - all of which sell cheaper phones with features similar to the iPhone.  But Cook said price adjustments in China, along with lower Chinese taxes on the iPhone and the trade-in and financing deals Apple offered, helped iPhone sales start to recover toward the end of the quarter.

Analysts reckon Dialog derives more than half its revenue from supplying Apple with power management integrated circuits (PMICs).  Dialog in December acknowledged that Apple could develop its own power chips. It said at the time there was no risk to its existing supply deals in 2018 and that it was in the advanced stages of working with Apple on designing \u201c2019-type products\u201d that could lead to commercial contracts by this month.  \u201cNegotiations over that chip are still ongoing.

Apple said it would appeal the watchdog\u2019s ruling, which it said was at odds with legal precedent in France.  In its decision, the French regulator said Apple imposed prices on retail premium resellers so that the prices were aligned with those charged by the California firm in its own shops, or on the Internet.  The watchdog said Apple\u2019s two wholesalers in France fully followed the U.S. company\u2019s instructions on how to allocate its products to customers, instead of freely determining their commercial policy.  \u201cApple and its two wholesalers agreed not to compete with each other and to prevent distributors from competing with each other, thereby sterilizing the wholesale market for Apple products,\u201d the watchdog said in a statement.

The mistake occurred when outsourced social media handler Sapient experienced \u201cVPN problems\u201d with a desktop computer so used an iPhone with a roaming SIM card in order to send the message on time at midnight, Huawei said in the memo.  Twitter, like several foreign services such as those from Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc, is blocked in China, where the Internet is heavily censored. To gain access, users need a virtual private network (VPN) connection.  Huawei, which overtook Apple as the world\u2019s second-largest smartphone vendor by volume in January-September, declined to comment on internal issues when contacted by Reuters.  Sapient did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent via the contact form on its website. Calls to its Beijing office went unanswered.

The pay rank of one of the employees - Huawei\u2019s digital marketing director - will also be frozen for 12 months, it said.

Four hospitals and more than a dozen other medical facilities in states including Massachusetts, California, Colorado and Michigan will receive stats including heart rate, steps taken and standing hours from patients waiting for or recovering from hip and knee replacement surgery.  The multi-year study in collaboration with Apple Inc will allow doctors and their teams to gauge better how well patients are following prescribed physiotherapy or regimes ahead of surgery or recovering afterwards.  More than a million knee and hip replacements occur every year in the United States, making them two of the most common surgeries Americans undergo.  \u201cWhen you look at what patients have to do when they undergo hip and knee replacement, in some cases they have very low support or guidance before and after surgery, which creates a lot of unnecessary fear and anxiety,\u201d Zimmer Biomet executive Dan Williamson said.  \u201cWe believe this is going to create a new ecosystem in orthopedics that ultimately drive less anxiety in patients, and more visibility from the surgeon.\u201d  The app could also help doctors monitor the health of their patients who prefer to stay at home after surgery rather than opt for nursing facilities and other care centers.

Japan Display Inc's logo is pictured at its headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, August 9, 2016. REUTERS\/Kim Kyung-Hoon  The plant would strengthen the company\u2019s position as the primary screen supplier for Apple Inc as sales of the iPhone 6 soared. And the U.S. smartphone juggernaut said it would front most of the $1.5 billion in costs, with Japan Display paying it back with a percentage of screen sales, according to two company sources.  Four years later, Apple\u2019s shifting fortunes have brought Japan Display to its knees and threaten to end Japan\u2019s long run as a leader in display technology.  A slowdown in iPhone sales, combined with a proliferation of new iPhone models - many of which use newer organic light-emitting displays (OLED) - have left Japan Display\u2019s new factory running at half capacity.  But it still owes Apple a majority of the construction cost, one of the company sources said. He declined to give the exact amount.  Desperate for capital, Japan Display is looking to an investor group, led by China Silkroad Investment Capital, for a bailout, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. The deal would give the Chinese group a near-majority stake in exchange for an investment of $500 million to $700 million, the sources said.  The group plans to build an OLED panel plant in China using Japan Display\u2019s technology, according to those two sources.  The company\u2019s woes show how weak iPhone sales and a broader slowdown in the smartphone business are causing pain across the Asian electronics supply chain.  \u201cIn retrospect, the new plant was unnecessary,\u201d one of the sources with direct knowledge of the bailout talks said. \u201cBut the decision wasn\u2019t wrong back then. Japan Display started to pick up steam thanks to Apple at the time, and Apple wanted the new plant.\u201d  Japan Display wasn\u2019t alone in betting on robust growth in iPhone sales, which looked especially attractive because of Apple\u2019s now-abandoned strategy of offering few variations in each product cycle.  \u201cWe were all thrilled to see lifetime sales of a single iPhone model reaching 100 million units,\u201d a source at another Apple parts supplier said.  \u201cSupplying components for just one model in massive volume is extremely cost-efficient,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, we exposed ourselves to huge volatility risks.\u201d  Japan Display has built relationships with other smartphone vendors, including Chinese powerhouses Huawei, Xiaomi, and OPPO.  But it is losing their orders too as sales growth softens and the Chinese players switch to domestic panel makers such as BOE Technology and Tianma Microelectronics, which have sharply improved the quality of their screens.  Japan Display supplied almost a third of Huawei\u2019s smartphone screens in 2015, but its share had plunged to 4 percent by the third quarter last year as the Chinese company turned to BOE and Tianma, according to researcher IHS Markit.  Sources at Japan Display and other Apple suppliers interviewed for the story declined to be identified as they are not authorised to talk to the media. Suppliers rarely speak about business with Apple on the record because of strict non-disclosure agreements.  NON-APPLE BUSINESSES  Japan Display was formed in 2012 in a government-backed merger of the ailing display units of Sony Corp, Toshiba Corp and Hitachi Ltd.  It boasts strength in so-called thin-film transistor technology (TFT), crucial for making high-resolution images on both LCD and OLED panels. In addition to its Apple business, which accounted for more than half the company\u2019s revenue over the last four years, it\u2019s a top supplier of dashboard panels for major automotive component companies such as Continental.  But Japan Display has struggled to navigate the fast-changing display business.  Its new LCD factory was still under construction when Apple informed Japan Display in autumn 2015 that it planned to move quickly away from LCD to the newer OLED technology, two former company officials said. It was too costly by then to abandon the half-completed plant, one of them said.  Japan Display\u2019s management at the time, led by former Sanyo Electric executive Mitsuru Homma, promised to start mass-production of OLED panels by 2018.  In the meantime, the management shut down older, unprofitable LCD lines to shift resources to OLED, but its main investor, a state-backed fund, blocked plans for drastic job cuts for fear of public backlash, one of the former officials said.  Unexpectedly weak sales of the iPhone 6s created a cash crunch in 2016, and Homma resigned early the next year after the company took a $640 million bailout from the state-backed fund.  The new chief executive, Nobuhiro Higashiiriki, declared a full-on shift to OLED. But the company was already behind rivals, notably Samsung Electronics, and still needed more cash for OLED investment. Disappointing sales of the iPhone XR, the only LCD model in Apple\u2019s 2018 lineup, were yet another blow.  \u201cThe company now looks exhausted, with many engineers leaving,\u201d one former employee said.  Some board members have expressed concerns about technology transfer that may follow the proposed Chinese investment, sources familiar with the talks said. But the government investment fund has run out of patience.  \u201cWe don\u2019t have any other option,\u201d one of the company sources said, adding that the government has been quiet about the bailout plan. \u201cThey could argue that display technologies are not something Japan must keep and protect, when Chinese panel makers are ramping up more display plants.\u201d","1004":"FILE PHOTO: People sit inside a closed Apple Store during the global outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Santa Monica, California, U.S., March 16, 2020.

The UK\u2019s other nations, whose response to the pandemic differs from that of England at times, also took action.

Qualcomm on Dec. 10 said it had won a preliminary court order in China banning Apple from selling some older iPhone models that the court found violated two Qualcomm software patents. The same day, Apple said that all of its phones remained on sale in China.  But on Dec. 14, Apple said that it would push a software update to its iPhones this week. The Cupertino, California-based company said it believed it was in compliance with the court\u2019s orders but that it would update its software \u201cto address any possible concern about our compliance with the order.\u201d  The update appeared to have been pushed to iPhones on Monday, according to user reports on Twitter, though Apple would not confirm to Reuters that it had been pushed.  \u201cDespite Apple\u2019s efforts to downplay the significance of the order and its claims of various ways it will address the infringement, Apple apparently continues to flout the legal system by violating the injunctions,\u201d Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm\u2019s general counsel, told Reuters in a statement on Monday.  Apple never publicly commented last week on why or how it believed its current iPhones for sale in China complied with the court\u2019s order, which concerned patents on software features for switching between apps on a smart phone and resizing photos before setting them as a wallpaper on a phone.  Several media outlets, including CNBC, reported that Apple believed the court\u2019s orders applied only to iPhones running older versions of its iOS operating system. But the court\u2019s orders, a copy of which Qualcomm provided to Reuters, made no mention of operating systems and focused only on software features.  \u201cApple\u2019s statements following the issuance of the preliminary injunction have been deliberate attempts to obfuscate and misdirect,\u201d Qualcomm\u2019s Rosenberg said in a statement on Monday.  Qualcomm believes Apple is still in violation of the court\u2019s orders because Apple continues to sell phones and has not received an explicit order from the Chinese court allowing it to do so.  \u201cThey are legally obligated to immediately cease sales, offers for sale and importation of the devices identified in the orders and to prove compliance in court,\u201d Rosenberg told Reuters in Dec. 14 in a statement.  Asked by Reuters about Qualcomm\u2019s statements, Apple reiterated its earlier statements that it believes it is in compliance with the court order.","1006":"NEW YORK, March 26 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc\u2019s credit card deal with Apple Inc is the latest move by the Wall Street investment bank to court mass-market consumers, potentially connecting Goldman with hundreds of millions of iPhone users.  But Goldman is entering a crowded market for co-branded cards where retailers often have the upper hand, and analysts question how much tolerance its shareholders will have for growing the bank\u2019s fledgling consumer business through credit card lending.  Goldman has been courting consumers since the 2016 launch of its online bank Marcus, and with its first credit card it is targeting fee-conscious ones. There will be no annual or late fees, and customers will pay variable annual interest rates of between 13.24 percent and 24.24 percent, according to Apple\u2019s website.  Apple and Goldman did not disclose the economic terms of their partnership when it was announced on Monday.  But banks have been increasingly willing to take less favorable deals because post-financial crisis regulations make the credit card business attractive for lenders, which are required to hold less capital against such debt than against other assets.  \u201cAs this kind of benign credit environment continues retailers have a greater leverage than they had a few years ago,\u201d said a person involved in similar credit card deals.  Issuing banks retain control of approving customers for cards, often using data the retailer has on shoppers as part of the process, the person said.  Goldman Chief Executive David Solomon said in an email to employees on Monday that the card is a \u201cmajor step\u201d in the bank\u2019s plan to grow its consumer business.  Solomon has said the consumer business is a critical part of the bank\u2019s strategy to grow revenues and cut costs, as revenue shrinks in traditional areas of strength for Goldman like bond trading.  But many investors have been uneasy with Goldman growing its unsecured consumer debt, especially at a time when many speculate that a recession could be looming, said UBS analyst Brennan Hawken.  Marcus now has $45 billion in customer deposits in the United States and the U.K., and has issued $5 billion in personal loans, according to Solomon\u2019s email.  While the amount of loans is small compared to the bank\u2019s overall balance sheet, Hawken said investors would likely prefer Goldman stick to using its consumer business to add deposits, as opposed to personal loans or credit card debt.  \u201cPeople want Goldman to be Goldman,\u201d Hawken said. Goldman declined comment for this article.  The Apple Card\u2019s wide interest rate range indicates that some customers might have lower credit scores, said Josh Siegel, chief executive of StoneCastle Financial Corp. However, the bank may not necessarily keep that risk on its books.  \u201cThey might securitize the debt, which wouldn\u2019t be anything new for an investment bank,\u201d Siegel said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that Goldman Sachs, all of a sudden, especially with where we are in the credit cycle, is going to go long on unsecured consumer debt.\u201d  As this is Goldman\u2019s first foray into credit cards, it may take the bank a year or two to assess the quality of its credit decisions, according to an industry expert who declined to be named.  The same person said that the stated range of possible interest rates on unpaid balances was too wide to clearly show how much credit risk Goldman expects to take.  Credit risk concerns aside, analysts said that Goldman\u2019s decision to launch its first credit card in partnership with one of the world\u2019s biggest companies gives it the opportunity to gain consumer market share.  While Apple says its card is \u201ccreated by Apple, not a bank,\u201d according to its website, the Goldman Sachs logo will appear on the back of the card.  \u201cFor Goldman this is a play for massive distribution without having to contort too much,\u201d said Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy and partner at Autonomous Research.  \u201cIt makes their brand way better at least in the retail and mass affluent marketplace.\u201d (Reporting By Elizabeth Dilts and Anna Irrera in New Yor.

U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington issued the preliminary injunction in a brief order late on Sunday. He declined \u201cat this time\u201d to block restrictions set to take effect on Nov. 12 on technical and business arrangements which are crucial for the app to function properly.  Nichols\u2019 detailed written opinion is expected to be released as soon as Monday.  The Commerce Department said in a statement it \u201cwill comply with the injunction and has taken immediate steps to do so.\u201d  The statement, which defended the TikTok order and Trump\u2019s executive order demanding owner ByteDance divest its TikTok U.S. operations, did not specify whether the government would appeal.  The injunction comes at a time when negotiations are underway to hammer out terms of a preliminary deal for Walmart Inc and Oracle Corp to take stakes in a new company, TikTok Global, that would oversee U.S. operations. Trump has said he had given the deal his \u201cblessing.\u201d  But key terms of the deal - including who will have majority ownership - are in dispute. ByteDance has also said any deal will need to be approved by China and Beijing has revised its list of technologies subject to export bans, in a way that gives it a say over any TikTok deal.  TikTok said it was pleased with the injunction and added it would maintain its \u201congoing dialogue with the government to turn our proposal, which the president gave his preliminary approval to last week, into an agreement.\u201d  John E. Hall, a lawyer for TikTok, argued earlier on Sunday that the ban was \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201cirrational\u201d.  \u201cHow does it make sense to impose this app store ban tonight when there are negotiations under way that might make it unnecessary?\u201d Hall asked during a 90-minute hearing. \u201cThis is just punitive. This is just a blunt way to whack the company. ... There is simply no urgency here.\u201d  Representatives for Chinese state media welcomed the ruling.  \u201cI think it is in line with morality, justice and common sense,\u201d Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of the Global Times newspaper said on Twitter on Monday.  Chinese state media have said they see no reason for China to approve the deal, describing it as based on \u201cbullying and extortion\u201d.

Any deal will also still need to be reviewed by the U.S. government\u2019s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).  The Justice Department said a preliminary injunction would be \u201cinterfering with a formal national security judgment of the president; altering the landscape with respect to ongoing CFIUS negotiations; and continuing to allow sensitive and valuable user information to flow to ByteDance with respect to all new users.\u201d  Another U.S. judge, in Pennsylvania, on Saturday rejected a bid by three TikTok content creators to block the ban, while a judge in California has blocked a similar order from taking effect that would ban Tencent Holdings\u2019 WeChat from U.S. app stores.","1016":"March 28 (Reuters) - United States Cellular Corp:  * U.S. CELLULAR TO OFFER NEW 9.7-INCH IPAD WITH APPLE PENCIL SUPPORT  * UNITED STATES CELLULAR CORP - CUSTOMERS WILL BE ABLE TO ORDER IPAD STARTING MARCH 30 IN U.S. CELLULAR STORES AND AT USCELLULAR.COM Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","1017":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O on Tuesday is expected to unveil new Mac computers using its own in-house processor chips, a move that could reignite a race to control the market for desktop and laptop chips and benefit players such as Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O.  FILE PHOTO: Flextronics International Apple factory employees work on Apple Mac Pro computer assembly in Austin, TX, U.S., November 20, 2019. REUTERS\/Tom Brenner  The market has been dominated by Intel Corp INTC.O and Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O since 2006, when Apple joined most other major computer makers in using chips based on Intel's 'x86' computing architecture.  On Tuesday Apple is expected to start a two-year process of ending its nearly 15-year relationship with Intel by introducing Mac computers with Apple-designed chips based on computing architecture technology from Arm Ltd, which Nvidia Corp NVDA.O has agreed to buy from SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T in a $40 billion deal.  Apple will design the chips using Arm technology and have them manufactured by a partner, most likely Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW, which makes processors for Apple's iPhone. UK-based Arm's technology also powers most Android phones.  Apple's forthcoming machines already have competition from Qualcomm, which since 2016 has worked with Microsoft Corp MSFT.O to adapt the Windows operating system to Qualcomm's Arm-based processors.  Qualcomm and Microsoft have worked with PC makers such as Lenovo Group Ltd 0992.HK and Asustek Computer 2357.TW to sell laptops using the new chips, and Microsoft's own Surface Pro X released last year uses a Qualcomm processor.  Those devices are niche sellers today, but Apple\u2019s entry into the market is likely to grab consumer attention around the emerging technology shift, especially if Apple begins to develop chips that rival Intel\u2019s performance.  \u201cApple diving headstrong into Arm will speed this up,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights & Strategy.  Arm-based PCs have key differences from Intel-based machines. Because the chips are derived from smartphones where power consumption is a key concern, they tend to claim better battery life than conventional machines. Like smartphones, they also turn on quickly and can remain constantly connected to cellular data networks.  \u201cWhere the connectivity has shined is the work from home situation,\u201d said Miguel Nunes, senior director for product management at Qualcomm. \u201cWe see a lot of people realizing that their WiFi at home can\u2019t keep up with everything.\u201d  But hurdles remain for Arm-based PCs. Most software written in the past 20 years was for Intel machines, and until it is rewritten, it may have to rely on \u2018emulation\u2019 that could slow down apps.  Intel\u2019s chip lineup \u201cenables people to use their favorite Windows applications without experiencing the potential performance penalties associated with running non-native apps on non-x86 architecture via Windows, or worry if their favorite applications will run on their platform,\u201d Intel said in a statement.  Ben Bajarin, principal analyst for consumer market intelligence at Creative Strategies, said the critical test for Arm-based computers will be whether developers rewrite software used by big businesses, which are still the largest purchasers of machines. Apple\u2019s entry to the market does not guarantee that will happen.  \u201cMost of Apple\u2019s hardcore developer base is going to be using Apple\u2019s proprietary developer tools,\u201d he said. But with Microsoft also providing development tools for Windows on Arm, a broader shift \u201cis not outside the realm of possibility.\u201d","1018":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google has added Apple Inc\u2019s TV app, which includes paid streaming service Apple TV+, to the latest Chromecast TV device, the search giant said on Thursday.

FILE PHOTO: Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Apple Tim Cook and Lisa Jackson arrive for the State Dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Joshua Roberts\/File photo  Cook, who has urged calm during the recent flare in U.S. trade tensions with China, held private talks with Trump in the Oval Office. He also spoke with the president\u2019s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.  Trump is preparing to send a delegation to China to try to head off a trade war that stands to harm Apple, the world\u2019s largest technology company, and other hardware makers that build products in China.  Trump has threatened a new round of $100 billion in tariffs on Chinese products that could target cellphones, computers and other consumer goods. China retaliated against an initial round of $50 billion in tariffs.  The meeting, which the White House said had been in the works for a couple of weeks, came the day after Cook sat at Trump\u2019s head table at his first state dinner, held in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron.  A White House official described the meeting as \u201cgood\u201d but neither the White House nor Apple provided details of the discussions.  Trump said earlier on Wednesday that he was looking forward to seeing Cook. \u201cWe will be talking about many things, including how the U.S. has been treated unfairly for many years, by many countries, on trade,\u201d he said on Twitter.  Cook also had strong relations with Trump\u2019s predecessor in the White House, Democratic President Barack Obama. He sat at the head table for Obama\u2019s 2015 state dinner honoring Chinese President Xi Jinping.  Cook has been to China at least three times since October, including paying a visit to Xi.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  \u2018GOOD GUY\u2019  Cook has become one of Trump\u2019s favorite CEOs to name-check in speeches. This was a surprising turn after a rocky start to their relationship. During his election campaign, Trump urged supporters to boycott Apple and criticized the company for making its products in China.  As president, Trump has called Cook a \u201cgood guy\u201d and mentioned him by name at least 10 times during public remarks, including during his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January and during several high-profile interviews.  The president frequently uses Cook and Apple as an example of how he says his tax cut package is creating jobs because it spurred the company to repatriate earnings it had held overseas.  Trump has frequently said he would not consider his presidency successful unless Apple builds manufacturing plants in the United States.  Apple has a market capitalization of $835 billion and 123,000 employees, 84,000 of whom are in the United States. The company said in January it plans to spend $30 billion in capital expenditures in the United States over the next five years, $10 billion of that on data centers.  Apple said its spending will create 20,000 new jobs through hiring at existing campuses in Cupertino and Austin as well as at a planned new campus.  Cook has also developed ties with Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, both senior advisers at the White House who work on tech training and government IT modernization issues.  His praise for Cook aside, Trump, a Republican, has had a sometimes tense relationship with the U.S. technology industry, based in Democratic strongholds such as California\u2019s Silicon Valley and in Seattle. He has clashed with the tech sector on issues including trade, immigration and the environment.  Cook has publicly objected to Trump\u2019s decision to end a program protecting from deportation young immigrants who were brought illegally to the United States as children. He was also among business leaders who criticized Trump after the president cast equal blame on white nationalists and anti-racism activists for violence last year in Charlottesville, Virginia.","1020":"SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics stands to be a major beneficiary of the China production problems announced by rival Apple Inc on Monday, reaping the rewards of a decade-long bet on low-cost smartphone manufacturing in Vietnam.  FILE PHOTO: Attendees look at a Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G smartphone during Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2020 in San Francisco, California, U.S. February 11, 2020. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam\/File Photo  Half of Samsung\u2019s smartphones are now made in Vietnam, where the coronavirus that has crippled the China operations of Apple and many other firms has so far had only a limited impact on its production.  Apple said on Monday it would not meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to the coronavirus impact on both production and sales in China, where most iPhones are made. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp last week also flagged a hit to its March quarter sales.  Huawei, another major Samsung rival, has not announced any production problems, but analysts expect it will also be hit hard due to its heavy reliance on Chinese manufacturing and parts. Many Chinese and foreign firms have begun to re-open China factories that were idled for weeks, but shortages of workers and other problems have in many cases kept output to a minimum.  Samsung has also largely ceded the China market to its rivals in recent years, meaning it won\u2019t suffer from the store closures and drop in demand that is hitting Apple and others.  \u201cSamsung is better positioned to weather the virus fallout than its formidable rivals such as Huawei and Apple,\u201d a person with knowledge of Samsung\u2019s supply chain told Reuters.  \u201cThe virus exposed China risks. We feel fortunate that we were able to escape the risks,\u201d he said.  Another person familiar with Samsung\u2019s thinking told Reuters: \u201cSamsung does not say it publicly. But it is relieved.\u201d  Still, two sources familiar with Samsung\u2019s Vietnam operations cautioned that should the virus outbreak be prolonged, Samsung would feel the impact, as the company sources many components from China.  Problems with cross-border shipments also cropped up in the early phases of the virus outbreak as Vietnam imposed stricter border controls, according to Hong Sun, vice chairman of Korea Chamber of Business in Vietnam. The issues have since been resolved, Sun said, but risks remain if Chinese parts suppliers cannot get back to work.  Samsung also relies on Chinese contract manufacturers for some low-end models.  In a statement to Reuters, the company said: \u201cWe are making our best effort to minimize any impact on our operations.\u201d  TrendForce recently cut its first quarter production forecasts for Huawei by 15% and Apple by 10%. It cut projections for Samsung Electronics by a smaller 3%.  Since starting phone production in Vietnam in 2009, Samsung has aggressively boosted output through cheaper labor and generous government incentives. A number of South Korean suppliers followed suit, powering its breakneck growth.  Samsung ended its own smartphone production in China last year as its market share plunged to nearly zero.  Apple makes most of its iPhones in China via Taiwanese company Foxconn.  Last week, Samsung unveiled a trio of flagship Galaxy s20 smartphones as well as its new foldable phone. Sources said the virus could delay new product launches by rivals.  But the woes of Apple and Chinese rivals are not necessarily good for Samsung, as the South Korean tech giant also supplies memory chips and displays for Apple\u2019s iPhones and other smartphones. Samsung counts Apple and Huawei among its top five customers.  \u201cThe virus outbreak is positive for Samsung\u2019s mobile division, but negative for Samsung\u2019s chip and display businesses,\u201d Greg Roh, an analyst at Hyundai Motor Securities, said.  \u201cSamsung will not be completely immune from the virus,\u201d he said.","1021":"FILE PHOTO: The popular video game \"Fortnite\" by Epic Games is pictured on a screen in this picture illustration August 14, 2020.

It referred to a statement issued in response to the Dec. 20 ruling in Munich, against which it is appealing.  Apple said at the time that, while a decision on the Munich appeal is outstanding, it would no longer stock the iPhone 7 and 8 at its 15 retail outlets in Germany, although its newer models would remain on sale.  All of its models remain available through carriers and resellers. Gravis, the leading Apple reseller in Germany, said on Tuesday it continued to stock the full range of iPhones.  Apart from the German order, Qualcomm has also secured a ban on the sale of some iPhones in China. Apple, which is also contesting that ruling, has continued to offer its iPhones in China but made changes to its iOS operating system following the order.  Qualcomm, meanwhile, faces a U.S. antitrust case brought by the Federal Trade Commission which accuses it of abusing a monopoly on mobile chip technology in a trial that could have a major impact on the smartphone industry.  If the government prevails in the trial that began on Jan. 4, Qualcomm could be forced to change its practices for licensing a trove of patents to device makers like Apple.

The Anglo-German chip designer struck a $600 million agreement with Apple last year to transfer people and patents involved in the design of the main power-management chips used at the heart of the iPhone.  That deal delivered its first windfall in the April-June quarter, as revenue of $482 million was buoyed by $146 million in one-off licence fees from Apple while underlying gross margins widened to 49.7%.  At the same time, Dialog\u2019s remaining business with Apple - which spans a broader range of products and technology - trebled in size, giving management the confidence to set guidance above market expectations.  \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to an even better third quarter,\u201d CEO Jalal Bagherli told Reuters in an interview, saying design wins from Apple to develop new mixed-signal integrated circuits would generate revenues over the next three years.  Dialog had pre-released its main second quarter figures on July 17. It said it now expected third-quarter revenues of $360-$400 million, ahead of a consensus estimate compiled by the company of $362 million, while its underlying gross margin was expected to be in line with the second quarter.  It narrowed its forecast for the year as a whole, saying revenue would decline by a mid-single-digit percentage as its legacy main power chip business with Apple rolls off, while margins would improve.  Markets have honoured the strategy shift, sending Dialog shares 140% higher since the Apple deal last October. They traded 1% higher at 40.42 euros, leaving some analysts ruing their earlier caution towards the stock.  \u201cThere is nothing we see in the results that is not to like,\u201d said analysts at JP Morgan, raising their target price for Dialog to 45 euros from 32 euros.  APPLE FOREVER?  Dialog, which is UK-based but listed in Frankfurt, had relied on Apple for three-quarters of its business - a level viewed by investors as risky because of the U.S. smartphone giant\u2019s history of pulling the plug on overcommitted suppliers.  In its downsized form, Dialog expects by 2022 to rely on Apple for no more than 40% of its revenue, a goal towards which Bagherli said the company was progressing well.  He pushed back against a suggestion that Dialog, in winning new business from Apple in peripheral power management applications, was once again increasing its dependence on its main customer.  The new Apple business spanned a broader range of uses, said Bagherli, including display and the audio signal chain. These were finding use in a wider range of products such as the Apple Watch, Airpods and Mac computer range.  Bagherli also highlighted a 52% sequential gain in Dialog\u2019s fast charger business in the second quarter, as demand in China recovered. He forecast continued growth in the Chinese market over the next six months.  And in the Internet of Things (IoT), Dialog saw 26% annual growth in low-energy Bluetooth products that are designed for use in connected devices with long battery lives.  On the broader outlook for the global smartphone market, Bagherli said it was mature and characterised by lengthening upgrade cycles.  But he saw the advent of 5G-enabled smartphones with broader appeal, and more energy-efficient chipsets than the early models now on the market, as a growth driver going into next year.  \u201c2020 is the year it starts to take off - and 2021 will be really high volume,\u201d said Bagherli.

Samsung Display, a unit of Samsung Electronics, was the sole supplier of OLED displays for Apple.  A spokeswoman at LG Display declined to comment.

The South Korean newspaper cited unidentified sources as saying that LG Display\u2019s flexible OLED panels recently passed a series of Apple\u2019s quality test.  If confirmed, the supply deal with a major smartphone maker could help LG Display gain a further foothold in the OLED display market. The South Korean company has high hopes for OLED business.

FILE PHOTO: Dialog semiconductor logo is pictured at a company building in Germering near Munich, Germany August 15, 2016. REUTERS\/Michaela Rehle  Shares in the Anglo-German company jumped 4 percent as investors credited the company\u2019s resilience at a time when other Apple suppliers have slashed or missed their targets.  The shares had fallen in early trade after Dialog said unaudited preliminary sales came in at $431 million in the fourth quarter, the low end of a guidance range of $430 million-$470 million, but they rebounded on the broader view that Dialog had weathered Apple\u2019s recent sales slowdown well.  \u201cDialog was one of the few Apple suppliers not to warn, stating at the time their comfort with the guidance provided,\u201d said Barclays analysts in a note.  Around 75 percent of Dialog\u2019s business is supplying power-management chips to Apple, which warned in November of slow year-end sales and on Jan. 3 issued its first sales warning in 12 years, blaming weaker iPhone sales in China.  Shares in suppliers have been hit as a result, with many forced to revise their guidance lower. Dialog, however, stood by its fourth-quarter revenue forecast and managed - just - to meet it.  CEO Jalal Bagherli said in November that Dialog was seeing less of an impact than other suppliers because its power-management chips were used across a broad range of Apple devices and not just in iPhones.  Dialog struck a $600 million deal last October to transfer people and patents to Apple as part of a push to diversify its business.  The company says the deal will buy it time to expand into new areas such as the Internet of Things that includes connected devices like home speakers, fitness trackers or smart watches.  The deal was not expected to affect revenues in 2018, but Dialog will lose out on Apple power chip deals going forward. The company, which will emerge smaller after the transaction, expects Apple to account for 35-40 percent of revenues by 2022.  Dialog said its cash on hand was $678 million at the end of 2018, up $199 million year-on-year, and that it was debt-free. It will publish audited results for 2018 on March 6.","1029":"FILE PHOTO: A motorcyclist rides past the logo of Foxconn, the trading name of Hon Hai Precision Industry, in Taipei, Taiwan March 30, 2018. REUTERS\/Tyrone Siu\/File Photo  TAIPEI (Reuters) - Apple's manufacturing partner Foxconn 2317.TW reported its biggest monthly drop in revenue in about seven years on Thursday as the coronavirus outbreak continued to play havoc with its business.  The Taiwanese company, which assembles Apple's AAPL.O iPhones, saw revenue sink 18.1% in February compared with a year earlier - the biggest monthly fall since March 2013 and the third straight month of decline. It warned the coronavirus epidemic would hit its bottom line in the first quarter.  Foxconn is among manufacturers worldwide grappling with virus-related curbs that have disrupted supply chains and dampened demand. Apple, its top client, rescinded its March quarter sales guidance, citing a slower ramp up of manufacturing in China amid travel restrictions and an extended Lunar New Year break.  Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said in a stock exchange filing that revenue fell to T$217.5 billion ($7.28 billion) in February.  The company, whose share price has dropped nearly 10% this year, warned earlier this week that revenue would fall more than 15% in businesses including consumer electronics and telecommunications products in the first quarter. But it added that revenue would recover thereafter as production returns to normal in virus-hit China.  The company said it did not expect to see any revenue growth in the first half and made a \u201cmild downward revision\u201d from its original guidance of \u201cslight growth\u201d for the year due to the coronavirus.  Foxconn has pledged to resume normal production in China, its top manufacturing base, by the end of March.  Any significant disruption at Foxconn would cloud Apple\u2019s timeline for new phones.  The flu-like virus, which originated in China, has spread to over 60 countries. There are now over 95,300 cases worldwide and more than 3,200 people have died, most of them in China, according to a Reuters tally.","1030":"NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks snapped a three-day rally on Friday as Apple shares dropped following a disappointing forecast and the White House dampened optimism over U.S.-China trade talks.

(GRAPHIC - Tech's third-quarter outlook: )  Even with the disparate forecasts for the third-quarter company results, tech stocks are outshining the market broadly in 2019.  The S&P 500 tech sector, which comprises over one-fifth of the benchmark index, has climbed more than 30% in 2019, compared to a 19% rise for the S&P 500 .SPX.  Federal Reserve easing of interest rates has helped the performance, which comes despite uncertainty about the health of the global economy and about U.S.-China trade tensions.  Tech is \u201cthe primary growth engine of the economy,\u201d said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston.  \u201cChina is an issue for them, but at the same time they continue to grow and they continue to innovate,\u201d Joy said. \u201cYou have to have exposure in technology. We just think as you look around at the market landscape, it\u2019s one of the better places to be right now.\u201d  The tech sector's strength is broad-based, including gains so far this year of about 30% or more from the four biggest industry groups by market value within the tech sector: software .SPLRCSOFW, IT services .SPLRCITCS, hardware, storage & peripherals .SPLRCCOPE and semiconductors .SPLRCSEQP.  \u201cThe IT budget continues to garner more dollars from the general budget of Corporate America,\u201d said Michael Seidenberg, portfolio manager for the global technology team at Allianz Global Investors. \u201cThere will be winners and losers within the sector, but I think generally speaking that is a trend that has persisted.\u201d  Of U.S. corporations, semiconductor makers are seen as among the most affected by the U.S.-China trade tensions, which have triggered big swings in their shares.  But the stocks still have prospered: the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index .SOX has climbed nearly 40% this year to all-time highs, while three chip stocks - KLA Corp KLAC.O, Lam Research Corp LRCX.O, Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O - are the tech sector's biggest 2019 gainers.  Despite the steep decline in third-quarter profits projected for S&P 500 semiconductor companies, analysts are optimistic there will be improvement soon, with semiconductors expected to post an 11% rise in 2020 earnings, according to Refinitiv data.  \u201cTo me, there\u2019s a huge disconnect between the performance of these names and the underlying fundamentals,\u201d said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust in Atlanta.  For software and other tech companies, the third quarter can be seasonally weak, said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh, who said she would be looking for executives to comment on whether business is being pushed back to future quarters.

But with the coronavirus pandemic spreading across the world, the urgent question for the company is how many buyers there will be both for current models and the new slate of phones expected in the fall.  A senior official at one of Apple\u2019s major contract assemblers said Apple\u2019s orders for the quarter ending in March are likely to drop 18% compared with the previous year. The production ramp-up for new phones that work with next-generation 5G networks has been postponed, this person said, though it is still possible the 5G phones could launch as scheduled in the fall.  \u201cNo one is talking about manpower or material shortage (in China) anymore. Now everyone is looking at whether demand from U.S. and Europe could keep up,\u201d said the person, who has direct knowledge of the matter. \u201cThe focus now is the demand from consumers in the U.S. and Europe.\u201d  One of Apple\u2019s key display suppliers is preparing for a similar level of contraction, according to a person familiar the matter. The company had anticipated shipping 70 million iPhone displays this year, but is now considering lowering that target by more than 17% to 58 million units.  The company is also planning to reduce the workforce at its Apple-designated production lines in its Vietnam factory, where displays are assembled before heading to China to be put into phones, this person said.  Apple declined to comment for this story.  Earlier this month, the company closed retail stores around the world even as it began to reopen outlets in China. With much of Europe and the United States on lockdown and unemployment soaring globally, there is little clarity on when demand might return.  The company could also yet face further supply chain problems as countries including Malaysia and Vietnam impose new restrictions to combat the coronavirus.  \u201cThings are changing on a day by day basis due to supply chain disruptions, so it is difficult to craft any meaningful comment at the moment about both supply and demand,\u201d said an official at one supplier in Malaysia.  FOGGY DEMAND OUTLOOK  In February, Apple retracted its sales forecast for the quarter ended in March without giving a new one. Shares have dropped more than 15% since the start of the year.  \u201cOur base case scenario assumes a shock to June quarter demand with steadily improving results\u201d in the second half of the year rather than a \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery, Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley wrote in a note to investors on March 18.  Taipei-based technology analyst Arthur Liao of Fubon Research cut iPhone shipment forecasts for this year\u2019s first quarter to 35 million units, down 17% from 41 million units a year ago. The firm lowered total iPhone shipment forecasts for 2020 to 198 million, down from an earlier forecast of 204 million.  In the United States, at least, consumers themselves seem uncertain whether they will resume spending. In a survey of more than 2,600 U.S. adults by Civis Analytics conducted March 18-20, more than half of respondents said they planned to spend about the same on consumer electronics as before the virus outbreak if the situation is contained in the coming weeks.  But if the situation worsens, the respondents were evenly split, with roughly one-third each saying they would spend less, the same or more on consumer electronics when conditions returned to normal.  Such ambiguity has made it hard for Apple suppliers to gauge how 2020 will play out.  One maker of a sensor for the iPhone said the company continues to produce and ship parts for Apple devices and that this year\u2019s first quarter ending in March was better than last year, with the second quarter also likely be higher volume than the year before.  \u201cWe were given a forecast for this quarter before the pandemic, about a month ago,\u201d a person familiar with the situation at the sensor supplier said last week. \u201cAnd now we are still producing as per the forecast given to us.\u201d (Reporting by Yimou Lee in Taipei, Heekyong Yang in Seoul, Krishna N.

Shares of AAC plunged almost 11 percent after the company said net profit dropped 39 percent from a year earlier to 653 million yuan ($95 million), the first quarterly fall since July-September 2014. The stock later recovered, closing 1.3 percent higher.  \u201cApple in terms of volumes is hitting a plateau this year, and while it has been successful in driving product prices and profits, volume stagnation affects its suppliers,\u201d said Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research.  AAC, which supplies acoustic and haptic components for Apple products such as the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch, was estimated by research and brokerage firm Sanford Bernstein to derive half of its revenues from the U.S. tech giant.  While Apple reported better-than-expected results for the June quarter, shipment volumes for iPhone and iPad were almost flat from a year earlier.  AAC\u2019s quarterly revenue fell 14.5 percent to 3.79 billion yuan, the biggest such drop since 2009, with margins also hit by a stronger yuan.  The company, which also supplies leading Chinese smartphone makers including Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], said smartphone unit sales were weaker than expected in the quarter amid a shrinking global smartphone market.  AAC competes against China\u2019s Goertek and US-based Knowles as one of the world\u2019s largest acoustic component makers. Shah at Counterpoint said the increasing number of products with microphones, such as smart speakers and TVs represent a bigger business opportunity, but competition is also tough.  AAC managing director Richard Mok told a media briefing that the company expects better profit margins in the traditionally stronger second half of the year, citing growth potential for its new optic lens business.

Some accessories have been central to Apple\u2019s efforts to diversify revenue beyond its signature iPhone, which pushed the company\u2019s market capitalization past $1 trillion in 2018 but has gone into decline this year.  The iPhone contributed less than half of Apple\u2019s revenue for the first time in seven years during its latest reported fiscal quarter. The iPhone\u2019s decline was offset by a 50% jump in sales of so-called wearables, such as the Apple Watch and AirPods, helping Apple beat Wall Street estimates and boosting its stock.  In July, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said wearables helped Apple sales in China, where iPhone sales have struggled. During the last quarter, the iPhone\u2019s market share in China declined to 5.8% from 6.4%, according to market research firm Canalys, in part because smartphone rival Huawei Technologies Co Ltd gained market share to become the country\u2019s top handset seller.  \u201cWe actually grew in mainland China,\u201d Cook told Reuters in an interview on July 30. \u201cNon-iPhone revenue grew 17%. We grew in every category outside of iPhone.\u201d  According to lists published by the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office, a broad category of items taken off a $200 billion tariff list last year will be subject to a 10% tariff as of Sept. 1.  These include popular products from Apple rivals, such as Fitbit FIT.N smart watches, smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O and Alphabet Inc's Google GOOG.O, and Bluetooth connected devices.  Fitbit, Amazon and Google did not immediately return requests for comment.","1040":"Feb 22 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway:  * INVESTMENT IN APPLE INC TOTALED $73.7 BILLION AS OF DEC 31, 2019  * INVESTMENT IN BANK OF AMERICA CORP TOTALED $33.4 BILLION AS OF DEC 31, 2019 Source: bit.ly\/2umsmhh Further company coverage:","1041":"FILE PHOTO: A motorcyclist rides past the logo of Foxconn, the trading name of Hon Hai Precision Industry, in Taipei, Taiwan March 30, 2018.

Cisco shares jumped nearly 5 percent after the network gear maker posted upbeat results and forecast, while Apple rose 1.2 percent after Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway made the iPhone maker its top investment.  The duo, along with strong gains in industrials, pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.75 percent to 25,079.59.  The S&P 500 gained 0.51 percent to trade at 2,712.32 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.47 percent to 7,177.39.  \u201cA lot of investors are looking for opportunities or pull backs to put money to work, there\u2019s still a lot of cash out there looking for something to do,\u201d said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.  \u201cI think we\u2019re back to \u2018buy the dips\u2019 mentality here.\u201d  A Labor Department report showed U.S. producer prices rose 0.4 percent in January, but only matched economists\u2019 estimates and likely helped further ease fears that inflation was picking up faster than expected.  That comes a day after strong January consumer prices data raised fears of inflation and faster interest rate hikes. A report showed an unexpected fall in retails sales last month. But after a dip, the market closed higher Wednesday.  \u201d ... The ability of the markets to spit out bad news in terms of the higher inflation, weaker sales is a pretty strong sign,\u201d Brown said.  The S&P 500 has now surged about 5 percent since last Thursday, but is still 5.5 percent below its record high on Jan. 26.  Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields hit a new four-year high of 2.9040 percent on strengthening expectations of a rate hike in March. But while yields have been on the uptick since the CPI data, they have not come at the cost of stocks.  A further boost to markets came from a continued fall in a key measure of near-term volatility. The CBOE Volatility index was at about 18-point mark on Thursday, well off the 50-point peak touched last week.  Also underpinning many investors\u2019 confidence is the view that the U.S. economy remains on strong footing as well as the expected boost of tax cuts on corporate profits.  Among the 11 major S&P sectors, the energy index and the telecoms index were in the red, falling 0.54 percent and 0.25 percent, respectively.  TripAdvisor gained about 14 percent after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,856 to 716.

The various colors of newly released Apple iPhone XR are seen following the product launch event at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  The price of the 64 GB iPhone XR has been reduced by at least 17,900 rupees ($259) due to a price cut and a credit card cashback campaign, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Thursday.  \u201cApple is going to change their game,\u201d one of the people said, adding the company could also adjust prices for other devices depending on their demand.  On Apple\u2019s India website, the price of the 64 GB iPhone XR was unchanged at 76,900 rupees, but is on sale for less than 59,000 rupees at stores, the people said.  Prices for the two other XR variants have also dropped, they said. The XR is the cheapest series among iPhones Apple launched last year.  The change in pricing of the iPhone XR is a short-term promotional offer, an industry source said.  Apple did not respond to a request for comment.  The price reduction comes after iPhone prices were lowered in China for the second time this year, as Apple wrestles with a prolonged sales slowdown in the world\u2019s largest smartphone market partly due to a slowing economy.  In India, Apple\u2019s iPhones are up against the more competitive pricing of rival handsets from South Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and China\u2019s OnePlus.  \u201cThe focus of this entire (price cut) exercise is to win customers who would have thought of going to Samsung or OnePlus, to make them think whether they can spend some extra money on an iPhone XR - it\u2019s more bang for the buck,\u201d said Rushabh Doshi of tech research firm Canalys.  Samsung\u2019s latest Galaxy S10e is priced at 55,900 rupees while the OnePlus 6T starts at 37,999 rupees.  Apple\u2019s share of India\u2019s $400-plus smartphone segment stood at 23 percent in 2018, behind both Samsung and OnePlus, showed data from Hong Kong-based tech researcher Counterpoint.  But with a share of just 1 percent of India\u2019s entire smartphone market, Apple responded last year by revamping its sales and distribution strategy.  Apple also plans to increase local production in a move that could help it limit the impact of a China-U.S. trade war. The company will soon begin assembling its top-end phones through the local unit of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn), Reuters previously reported.","1044":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc\u2019s Apple News+ service will offer content from 300 popular magazines and newspapers for just $10 a month.

The annual price of a $100 digital subscription to the New Yorker plus a $20 annual subscription for Vanity Fair alone would equal the $120 annual cost of Apple News+, which will also include hundreds of other publications.  Conde Nast said it believes its current subscribers will continue to pay for the archives and digital content, which is not included in Apple News+.  Apple did not specify what will be made available by other publishers, leaving it to the publishers themselves to explain their role in the service.

A monthly digital subscription to the Journal costs $39 per month.  A source briefed on the arrangement said all Journal content will technically be available on the Apple service, but that only certain stories would be promoted to users, mainly in the general news category. Readers will be able to find all Journal content through a search in the app, but will not be able to browse it freely, the source said.  Executives from Dow Jones, which owns the Journal, said during a company meeting on Monday that they do not believe existing subscribers will leave the paper for Apple\u2019s subscription service, and instead view the readers brought to the paper by Apple News+ as prospective customers for full subscriptions, according to a source who listened to the meeting.

Meredith said the full digital editions of its print magazines, such as People and Real Simple, will be available on Apple News+.  \u201cApple News+ subscribers can access current and past issues and individual articles from magazines,\u201d Apple said in a statement, but it will not allow advertisers to track what users read, and Apple itself will not have that data.

Slideshow ( 5 images )  The U.S. tech giant has brought about a design aesthetic with its iPhone and iPad that set it apart from rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS and Sony Corp 6758.T and helped make it the most valuable company in the world.  For Europe\u2019s biggest automaker, adopting simplicity as the guiding principle for future styling of electric vehicles (EVs) marks a departure from the era before its 2015 \u201cdieselgate\u201d emissions scandal, when vehicle design conveyed the German group\u2019s engineering prowess and technological ambitions.  \u201cWe are currently redefining the Volkswagen values for the age of electrification,\u201d Klaus Bischoff, head of VW brand design, said in an interview. \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is to be as significant, purist and clear as possible and also to visualize a completely new architecture.\u201d  With regulators slashing emissions on a fast timetable, dieselgate has also energized the costly shift to EVs that is necessary to compete in China, VW\u2019s largest market, and to avoid future fines in Europe.  Previously a laggard on electrification, VW has pledged 34 billion euros ($42.45 billion) of investment in EVs, self-driving technology and digital mobility businesses across the group by 2022.  The core namesake brand alone will spend 6 billion euros on a new modular platform dubbed MEB designed to underpin over 20 purely battery-powered models such as the I.D. hatchback, I.D.

Based on Apple\u2019s Tuesday earnings release, the magic number that gets the iPhone maker to $1 trillion right now is $206.49 - but probably not for long.  Apple\u2019s stock was up 5.4 percent at an all-time high of $200.48 on Wednesday, thanks to the company\u2019s better-than-expected results and its aggressive share buybacks.  As part of its June-quarter report late on Tuesday, Apple said it bought back $20 billion of its own stock here and that its share count as of the end of June had declined to 4,842,917,000 here, which would mean its stock price must reach $206.49 for the company to hit a $1 trillion market capitalization.  Based on the share count listed on its balance sheet on Tuesday, Apple\u2019s stock market value was at $971 billion.  However, Apple is expected on Wednesday to file its more detailed quarterly report to the Securities and Exchange Commission with an even more recent share count, which may well show a further dip due to Apple\u2019s buyback program. If that is the case, then Apple\u2019s would need to hit a higher stock price to touch a market value of $1 trillion.  \u201cOnce that 10-Q comes out, the numbers will change,\u201d said S&P Dow Jones Indices analyst Howard Silverblatt, who is currently focused on $206.49 as the number to watch. \u201cApple has been very vocal that they plan to continue their buybacks and obviously they have the resources.\u201d  Pegging a company\u2019s share count - and market capitalization - is often a moving target.  Ahead of Apple\u2019s report on Tuesday, its most up-to-date share count was 4,915,138,000. At that count, its stock would have had to hit about $203.45 for Apple\u2019s market value to reach $1 trillion.","1054":"FILE PHOTO: Silhouette of laptop user is seen next to a screen projection of Apple logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018.

Trump met Cook on Wednesday during his visit to Apple\u2019s upcoming campus in Texas, in the latest sign of a close relationship between two of America\u2019s most powerful men.  This is not the first time Trump has used his Twitter account to address Cook.

The United States has been pressing nations not to grant Huawei access to future 5G networks and alleged Huawei\u2019s equipment could be used by Beijing for spying, which the Chinese company has repeatedly denied.  The U.S. Congress has been considering legislation to authorize up to $1 billion for small and rural wireless providers to replace network equipment from companies such as Huawei.

FILE PHOTO: Japan Display's logo is seen at a display of its products at its headquarters in Tokyo, Japan October 7, 2019. REUTERS\/Kim Kyung-Hoon  The deal will give the independent Japanese investment manager effective control of the liquid crystal display (LCD) maker, replacing the Japanese government-backed INCJ fund as the top shareholder.  The bailout comes as Apple AAPL.O, which sources LCD panels for iPhones from Japan Display, has shown its commitment to financially support Japan Display, which sources said reassured other investors.  The U.S. tech giant has agreed to shorten payment periods, relax debt repayment terms and put up $200 million. Japan Display generated 61% of its revenue from Apple in the last financial year.  Apple is also leading talks on the potential sale of Japan Display's idled smartphone screen factory to Sharp Corp 6753.T, another iPhone display supplier, sources familiar with the matter said.  Japan Display owes Apple more than $800 million for the $1.5 billion cost of building the plant four years ago.  Ichigo, with more than $7 billion under management, will initially inject 50.4 billion yen into Japan Display by purchasing preferred shares upfront by late March, taking a 44.26% stake.  It is offering to buy an additional 50.4 billion yen in preferred shares for a later date, which could boost its stake up to 70.43% when converted into common shares.  Scott Callon, Ichigo\u2019s chief executive officer, would join Japan Display as the company\u2019s chairman.  Japan Display has been losing money for the past five years because of its late shift to organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens, competition from cut-price Chinese players and slowing growth in smartphone demand.  Bailout talks have been repeatedly derailed as Chinese investment firm Harvest and several other potential investors pulled out of the plan.  Japan Display was formed in 2012 when the LCD businesses of Hitachi Ltd 6501.T, Toshiba Corp 6502.T and Sony Corp 6758.T merged in a government-brokered deal.","1063":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Strong U.S. consumer holiday spending will not boost retailers across the board but instead benefit winners like Apple Inc AAPL.O that have signature products, Esplanade Capital's Shawn Kravetz said at the Reuters Global Investment 2019 Outlook Summit in New York on Wednesday.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Shares of the iPhone maker slipped 3 percent in midday trading Wednesday, sending them down more than 20 percent from their recent highs and into a bear market.  Yet Kravetz said that he added to his position in Apple Wednesday morning because the company is expanding its reach into recurring services and add-ons that are not dependent on iPhone sales growth.  \u201cWe know it is not a Facebook or a Google with eye-popping growth but we\u2019re not paying for that,\u201d Kravetz said, referring to Apple\u2019s 15.8 price to earnings multiple. At the same time, Apple is less likely to come under regulatory scrutiny into the use of data as some other Silicon Valley giants, he said.  \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t shock me to see its peers go down another 20 percent while Apple rallies,\u201d he said.  Along with Apple, Kravetz said that he has been adding to his positions in casino stocks. He believes the sell-off that has pushed down share prices in the sector by approximately a third this year is an overdone reaction to concerns about growth in China and other emerging markets.  His fund has added to its positions in Caesars Entertainment Corp CZR.O, casino video game maker International Game Technology PLC IGT.N and Penn National Gaming Inc PENN.O this year, he said, in part because of steep declines that he called \"an absolute gift.\"  \u201cWe don\u2019t think casinos will be a canary in a coal mine\u201d that signal a coming recession, he said. Instead, \u201cWe think we will see more M&A as the leaders try to get bigger and try to consolidate some of their power,\u201d he said.  Kravetz said that strong consumer spending, boosted in part by low unemployment rates and rising wages, will not translate into widespread gains across retailers due to rising costs as companies try to keep up with the fast, free shipping pioneered by Amazon.com Inc.  Off-price retailers such as Burlington Stores Inc BURL.N, TJX Companies Inc TJX.N and Ross Stores Inc ROST.O could be one casualty of shoppers becoming more sophisticated at finding deals at a time when each company has announced expansion plans, he said.  \u201cThey\u2019ve been the place to hide through thick and thin for a decade.

REUTERS\/Kim Kyung-Hoon\/File Photo  A further delay of a cash injection could raise questions about the survival of the ailing smartphone screen maker, which has been hit by Apple\u2019s slowing iPhone sales and a late shift to organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens.  Japan Display said in a statement it would make an announcement once it had received notice from the consortium, which includes Taiwanese flat screen maker TPK Holding Co Ltd and Chinese investment firm Harvest Group.  The consortium reached a basic agreement on the deal in mid-April but delayed formalising it to reassess Japan Display\u2019s prospects.  Soon after that delay, client Apple agreed to wait for money owed and the biggest shareholder, the Japanese government-backed INCJ fund, offered to forgive 44.7 billion yen in debt.  Japan Display is shrinking the smartphone display business to stop cash outflows and seeking to cut 1,200 jobs. It is also temporarily suspending a main display panel plant funded by Apple and closing one of the lines at another main panel plant.  Those restructuring measures could result in a loss of as much as 79 billion yen for this financial year ending in March, the company said this week.  The bailout deal would allow the buyers to become Japan Display\u2019s biggest shareholders with a 49.8 percent stake, replacing the Japanese government-backed INCJ fund.  Japan Display was formed in 2012 by combining the LCD businesses of Hitachi Ltd, Toshiba Corp and Sony Corp in a deal brokered by the government.

Liu of KGI said that thanks to Apple\u2019s new models, August export orders for information communication products and electronic products grew 10 percent and 9.6 percent respectively, \u201cwhich is higher than the overall export orders\u2019 year-on-year growth\u201d.  The economics ministry said it expects Taiwan\u2019s September export orders to grow in the range of 5.0-7.1 percent from a year earlier.  \u201cThe peak for export orders will be in October-November,\u201d Lin predicted.  The latest round of tariffs imposed on imports from China announced this month, encompassed some tech components, including computer servers and networking gear that power \u201ccloud\u201d data centers.  One major Taiwan supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. saw August sales slightly decrease by 0.9 percent year on year.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc on Monday launched a \u201cSign In With Apple\u201d function to rival Facebook and Google web login accounts, drawing a contrast with rivals by stressing protection of users\u2019 information.  When users sign in with their Google or Facebook Inc profiles to third-party apps, the apps often share valuable data with Google and Facebook, a practice that Apple is looking to stop. Apple announced the move at its annual software developer conference in San Jose, California, where it also showed new features for its operating systems for iPhones, iPads and Macs and said it would retire the iTunes app after 18 years in favor of separate apps for music, movies and podcasts.  Privacy themes ran throughout the event, with Apple creating a system for its users to sign up for apps with a randomly generated email to avoid revealing their true address. The iPhone maker also tightened controls on location tracking, saying it would stop apps from scanning Bluetooth and Wi-Fi networks to guess a user\u2019s location even when the user has disabled tracking.  Apple has emphasized privacy in effort to set itself from rivals such as Facebook and Google, both of whom use data to boost their advertising businesses and whose practices have come under scrutiny.  \u201cLocation-based tracking, for example, is much more nefarious than most people realize,\u201d said Bob O\u2019Donnell, head of TECHnalysis Research. \u201cYou can find out more about someone from their location than things like what they\u2019re searching for.\u201d  Apple is unlikely to make any money directly off the new services, analysts said. Instead, features like the web sign-on are likely to drive brand loyalty by making it easier for users to log into apps without having to juggle multiple passwords, said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies.  But Apple, whose iPhone sales have started to fall after nearly a decade of sustained growth, is also working to persuade consumers that its hardware is worth its higher price in part because it protects their data. Bajarin said Apple appears to be working to \u201cfirewall\u201d off its customers from data collection practices it disagrees with.  \u201cYou look at all these regulations that have come down...and the goal of them is to give consumers more control over their data. Apple is saying, if you guys aren\u2019t going to do it - and they\u2019re talking to the other big companies - we\u2019ll do it for our customers,\u201d Bajarin said.  Apple closed down 1% at $173.30. Earlier in the day, Reuters reported that the U.S. Justice Department has assumed jurisdiction for a potential probe of Apple as part of a broader review of whether technology giants are using their size to act in an anti-competitive manner.","1073":"SHANGHAI, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Asian equity markets rose on Friday as China and the United States expressed optimism about resolving their bruising trade war, though a warning from tech giant Apple Inc on holiday sales amid emerging market weakness could weigh on technology shares.  MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.46 percent, adding to the previous session\u2019s strong gains. But that came after a sharp 10.3 percent dive in October, its worst month since August 2015.  Australian shares were down 0.18 percent, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei stock index was up 1.27 percent.  The improved mood in early Asian trade followed a rise in U.S. shares overnight, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 each gaining 1.06 percent while the Nasdaq Composite rallied 1.75 percent.  A combination of bargain-hunting following steep losses in equities last month and some strong corporate earnings have helped power Wall Street\u2019s bounce. Investors also lapped up news that the leaders of the world\u2019s two largest economies may be ready to take concrete steps to resolve their bitter trade dispute - one of the major factors behind a rout in riskier assets recently.  U.S. President Donald Trump said trade discussions with China were \u201cmoving along nicely\u201d and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping expressed hopes of expanding the bilateral trade cooperation.  Trump said he planned to meet with Xi at an upcoming G-20 summit  All the same, underscoring risks around Sino-U.S. trade relations, a U.S. Justice Department indictment said companies based in mainland China and Taiwan had conspired to steal trade secrets for a U.S. semiconductor firm.  Elsewhere, there was also enough uncertainty to go around for investors, with slowing factory growth around the world adding to worries about the outlook for corporate earnings, business investment and trade.  Data from the U.S. also showed cooling manufacturing activity in October as a measure of new orders hit a 1-1\/2 year low. That came after manufacturing surveys showed factory activity and export orders weakening across Asia as the impact of the trade war deepened.  Adding to the anxiety, Apple Inc on Thursday warned that sales for the holiday quarter would likely miss Wall Street expectations due to macroeconomic weakness in emerging markets including Brazil, Russia, India and Turkey.  \u201cApple\u2019s results could set the tone for equities today,\u201d analysts at National Bank of Australia said in a note.  In currency markets, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was up 0.07 percent at 96.344 after a sharp drop on Thursday.  The dollar had fallen across the board, as the pound rallied on reports that London is close to sealing a financial services deal with Brussels, and the Bank of England hinting at slightly faster interest rate rises in future.  \u201cA corrective setup is in place for the for the USD, with overbought valuations and a series of reversals across various currency pairs arguing for a short-term pullback,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analysts said in a note.  The pound fell 0.15 percent to $1.2990.  The weaker dollar also boosted the offshore yuan, which was at 6.9242 per dollar after touching 6.9800 on Thursday, its weakest level since January 3, 2017.  The dollar rose 0.05 percent against the yen to 112.76 .  The single currency was down 0.09 percent on the day at $1.1397.  U.S. crude dipped 0.16 percent at $63.59 a barrel.

Unveiled by EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager and EU industry chief Thierry Breton in December last year, the two sets of rules are known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA).  DMA takes aim at online gatekeepers which will be subject to a list of dos such as sharing some data with rivals and regulators and don\u2019ts among them not favouring their own services on their platforms.  The DSA requires large online platforms and other internet players to do more to tackle illegal content, be more transparent about political advertising on their platforms.

On the DSA, the agency said profiling of users for content moderation purposes should be banned and that online targeted advertising should be phased out and banned in the case of pervasive tracking while some data should be shielded from targeted advertising.

Apple last year said it meets all of its needs with renewable energy such as solar farms that power data centers. But a large part of its carbon footprint comes from its supply chain, and since 2015 Apple has worked directly with those companies to use clean energy for Apple production.  Forty-four companies are now in the program, Apple said on Thursday, including Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, whose Foxconn unit makes iPhones, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, which supplies the A-series chips that power all of Apple\u2019s mobile devices. Apple had previously disclosed 23 suppliers in the program.  The company defines clean energy as coming from wind, solar or bio-gas fuel cells, as well as what it calls \u201clow-impact\u201d hydroelectric projects like a site in Oregon that captures energy from water in irrigation canals to power one of its data centers.  Apple did not specify where the new suppliers in the program would get the clean energy. It encourages suppliers to build their own renewable energy projects, such as when iPad assembler Compal last year built rooftop solar installations on its factories in China.  When those options are not available, Apple says it aims to have suppliers sign power-purchase agreements with new renewable energy projects and using purchases of renewable energy credits only when there are no other options.  In an interview, Lisa Jackson, Apple\u2019s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, said the company is also on track to pass its goal of adding 4 gigawatts of renewable energy to the grids of its supply chain by 2020 and has a \u201csight line\u201d to \u201cwell over\u201d 5 gigawatts.

Technology stocks led a selloff in Asian, European and U.S. stock markets after Apple, blaming weaker iPhone sales in China, cut its revenue forecast for the first time in nearly 12 years. Apple\u2019s U.S.-listed shares were last down 9.7 percent.  That heightened concerns that sluggish global growth may be reflected in the United States, where corporate earnings season is set to kick off in a few weeks.  Survey data from the Institute for Supply Management showed U.S. factory activity slowed more than expected in December, sending stocks on Wall Street lower.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple\u2019s new credit card is a remarkable thing. Not because of the cash back offered to users \u2013 they can get similar deals elsewhere. And not because it\u2019s made of titanium and has no numbers printed on it. The unusual thing is that in order to muscle in on a competitive industry, issuer Goldman Sachs has tossed aside many of the features that make the card business lucrative for banks in the first place.  Credit-card issuers make a return after tax of around 2.6 percent of loans outstanding, according to Accenture, more than the biggest banks make overall. Three things that contribute to those returns are interest on unpaid balances, fees for things like late payment, and complexity. Competing offerings are hard to compare cleanly, because of a dizzying array of rates and rewards, including hard-to-value freebies like air miles.  Goldman has eschewed most of that. There are no fees on the Apple Card \u2013 at all. The rewards are simple: Rather than points, users get cash back when they buy stuff, with the highest payback coming on purchases of Apple products. The Wall Street firm has also denied itself the chance to offset its generosity with high interest charges \u2013 the card\u2019s rates will be \u201camong the lowest in the industry.\u201d  In practice, Apple Card will help consumers keep the actual rates they pay even lower, advising them how much to repay and when, in order to minimize cost. They even get their cash back daily, rather than waiting until the end of the month. By being so transparent, the $69 billion Goldman is putting the customer first, and itself second.  Why do this? Goldman presumably believes it can keep its returns healthy by identifying customers who won\u2019t default on their loans, in part through smart use of data. Also Chief Executive David Solomon will, at a swoop, put the firm on the map in an industry where just four companies \u2013 Citigroup, JPMorgan, Bank of America and Capital One \u2013 hold half of all U.S. card balances.  Even at half the rate of return rivals get, Goldman\u2019s credit-card business would still beat the group\u2019s overall yield on assets, which was 1.1 percent last year. To score a landmark deal, it can afford to let Apple \u2013 and its customers \u2013 dictate the terms.","1093":"FILE PHOTO: The Apple logo is shown atop an Apple store at a shopping mall in La Jolla, California, U.S., December 17, 2019, 2019.

It said its policy was based on the United Nations\u2019 guiding principles on business and human rights.  Human rights activists have also called on Apple to cut ties with suppliers alleged to be using the forced labour of thousands of ethnic Uighurs in Chinese factories and it has faced much criticism for removing an app that helped Hong Kong protesters track police movements.  Apple argued that the app was being used to target individual police officers and to victimize individuals and property, violating Hong Kong law.","1095":"(Reuters) - Tapping factories in Brazil and India has not lessened Apple Inc's AAPL.O dependence on China, the company's supply chain data shows, raising the stakes for the iPhone maker as U.S. President Donald Trump wages a trade war and promises more tariffs.  Apple faces levies of 15% imposed by Trump\u2019s administration on major products made in China such as smartwatches and wireless headphones on Sept. 1, with a tariff on its biggest seller, the iPhone, to take effect on Dec. 15.  Interactive: Apple's dependence on China Here\u2019s how the U.S.-China trade war could take a bite out of one of America\u2019s most recognizable brands.  Few American firms are as tightly bound to Asia\u2019s largest economy as Apple. Contract factories owned by Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd\u2019s Foxconn, Pegatron Corp, Wistron Corp and others employ hundreds of thousands of workers to assemble Apple devices.  In recent years, Apple's contract manufacturers have expanded into other countries. India, for example, had no Apple contract manufacturer locations in 2015 but expanded to three assembly facilities by 2019, including a factory owned by Foxconn, which plans to make models from the iPhone X family of devices, Reuters reported last year reut.rs\/2Nw82kJ.  Apple taps the India operations to avoid steep import duties on iPhones in one of the last fast-growing mobile phone markets on the planet, similar to Apple and Foxconn's move to open a production facility in Brazil reut.rs\/2U9IuLj in 2011.  But the factories outside China are smaller and, in the case of India and Brazil, Apple only uses them to meet domestic demand. Apple\u2019s contract factories inside China, meanwhile, have added far more locations than outside, with Foxconn alone expanding from 19 locations in 2015 to 29 in 2019 and Pegatron going from eight to 12, according to Apple\u2019s data. The new locations come as Apple has added watches, smart speakers and wireless headphones to its product lineup.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Graphic:  And beyond the contract factories, the rest of Apple\u2019s suppliers - the companies that sell it chips, glass, aluminum casings, cables, circuit boards and much more - became more concentrated in China. Among all supplier locations, 44.9% were in China in 2015, a proportion that rose to 47.6% by 2019, the data showed.  Reuters analyzed five years\u2019 worth of supply chain data published by Apple. The data includes more than 750 locations each year between 2015 and 2019 for the California company\u2019s top 200 suppliers based on Apple\u2019s spending. Apple does not disclose how much it spends with each, and the companies on the list can change as different suppliers make the top-200 cutoff among Apple\u2019s thousands of suppliers.  Reuters sorted the data and calculated the overall portion of Apple\u2019s supply chain in China. In a few cases each year, Apple did not provide a specific address and Reuters excluded that location.  Apple declined to comment on Reuters\u2019 analysis. In July, Chief Executive Tim Cook told investors on the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t put a lot of stock into\u201d speculation about how the company would shift production because of U.S. tariffs.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cThe vast majority of our products are kind of made everywhere,\u201d Cook said on the call. \u201cThere is a significant level of content in the United States, and a lot from Japan to Korea to China, and the European Union also contributes a fair amount. ... I think that will carry the day in the future as well.\u201d  NO PLACE LIKE CHINA  Apple faces hurdles in diversifying beyond China, where the clustering of multiple suppliers allows it to make hundreds of millions of devices per year while holding only a few days\u2019 worth of inventory, which is critical to the free cash flow Apple investors prize.  Other phone makers ship far fewer units and have more flexibility. Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google is shifting its Pixel smartphone production to Vietnam from China starting this year as it builds a cheap supply chain in Southeast Asia, the Nikkei business daily reported on Wednesday.  But Apple\u2019s scale works against it because few other nations have workforces as large as China. Factories require highly skilled engineers to design and troubleshoot custom tools and processes. Vietnam, where Apple has manufactured accessories for years, has a population less than one-tenth the size of China.  Even if Apple can make devices in India or Vietnam, the volumes would be small compared with Apple\u2019s overall needs.  Outside of China, \u201cthere few places in the world that have the infrastructure to produce 600,000 phones a day,\u201d said Dave Evans, chief executive of San Francisco supply chain firm Fictiv.  Apple has so far been spared tariffs on major products, winning a reprieve last year on many wireless devices. And Cook has cultivated a close relationship with Trump over dinners and private meetings at the White House.  Apple has told trade officials that it generally believes tariffs will result in higher prices for U.S. consumers but has not said whether it plans to pass tariffs onto customers by raising prices.  For electronics products, where the circuit board is made can sometimes determine the product\u2019s country of origin, said George R. Tuttle III, a customs attorney who has worked with electronics firms.  That leaves open the possibility that device makers could make circuit boards or other key components outside China while still assembling devices there to avoid tariffs.  Apple has disclosed no such plans. But the India unit of Foxconn, which also performs work for HMD Global's Nokia-branded phones and Xiaomi Corp in addition to Apple, has developed the ability to make circuit boards in India, two industry sources told Reuters last year reut.rs\/2Zx6HQU.","1096":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Apple Inc said on Friday it had found some issues affecting some of its iPhone X and 13-inch MacBook Pro products and said the company would fix them free of charge.

Its top-end iPhones now sell for as much as $1,449 and its best iPad goes for as much as $1,899.  Apple said displays on iPhone X, which came out in 2017 with a starting price of $999, may experience touch issues due to a component failure, adding it would replace those parts for free. The company said it only affects the original iPhone X, which has been superseded by the iPhone XS and XR released this autumn.  The screens on affected phones may not respond correctly to touch or it could react even without being touched, the Cupertino, California-based company said.  For the 13-inch MacBook Pro computers, it said an issue may result in data loss and failure of the storage drive. Apple said it would service those affected drives.  Only a limited number of 128GB and 256GB solid-state drives in 13-inch MacBook Pro units sold between June 2017 and June 2018 were affected, Apple said apple.co\/2AXkeEw on its website.  Last year, Apple began a massive battery replacement program after it conceded that a software update intended to help some iPhone models deal with aging batteries slowed down the performance of the phones. The battery imbroglio resulted in inquires from U.S. lawmakers.  In June, Apple said it would offer free replacements for the keyboards in some MacBook and MacBook Pro models. The keyboards, which Apple introduced in laptops starting in 2015, had generated complaints on social media for how much noise they made while typing and for malfunctioning unexpectedly.

That could affect smaller technology firms such as Eero, a startup company that makes home routers and had asked to be exempted from the tariffs. Altogether about 300 product categories were given reprieves, including some non-tech consumer devices such as bicycle helmets and baby car seats.  Apple did not respond to a Reuters request for comment, and Eero declined to comment. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook had dinner with U.S. President Donald Trump last month, though neither gave details of discussions.

The liquid crystal display (LCD) maker for smartphones, which gets more than half of its revenue from Apple, reversed its forecast for a profit for the year ending in March after reporting on Thursday a net loss of 1.3 billion yen for the October-December quarter.  The quarterly loss compares with the 17 billion yen average profit estimate of three analysts, according to Refinitiv data. For the full year, nine analysts had on average estimated a profit of 8.1 billion yen, the data showed.  The losses are making the company desperate for fresh cash, as previous, publicly funded bailouts have failed to help the company reduce its dependence on Apple or to accelerate a shift to OLED panels.

The new performance-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, which offers cash-back to manufacturers for exports, will have a budget of up to 70 billion rupees ($964.5 million) over five years, the sources said. It\u2019s expected to be launched by the end of February.  Apple, along with others, is lobbying for a bigger budgetary outlay of 200 billion rupees before that plan is finalised, as India doesn\u2019t yet have the scale or the supply chain for making IT products and competes with duty-free imports of tech products, two of the sources said.  Apple\u2019s push comes at a time its iPhone supplier Wistron is just restarting operations at a southern Indian plant after angry workers went on a rampage last year. Apple is yet to take the Taiwan manufacturer off of probation.  Apple declined to comment for this story.  New Delhi is also planning another PLI, at a budget of roughly 50 billion rupees over five years, to boost domestic manufacturing of wearable devices such as smartwatches, the sources said, adding the plan could be announced within two months.  All the sources declined to be named as the plans are not public.  INDIA-MADE IPAD  Apple assembles a bulk of its iPads in China, but is fast diversifying production to markets such as India and Vietnam to minimise the impact of the U.S.-China trade war and the coronavirus crisis.  Its top supplier Foxconn is building assembly lines for iPads and MacBook laptops in Vietnam, Reuters reported late last year. Other iPad assemblers include Taiwan\u2019s Compal Electronics and China\u2019s BYD Electronic International.  In India, Apple will likely have iPad\u2019s assembled by one of its existing suppliers in the country as early as this year, two of the sources said, though its plans could get delayed as India makes the entry of BYD difficult amid its wariness to give new tech business to Chinese companies.  \u201cThe government is asking Apple to get iPads assembled by its contract manufacturers here, the non-Chinese companies\u201d one of the sources, a government official said.  It was not immediately clear which of Apple\u2019s three contractors in India - Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron - would assemble iPads.  Pegatron and Wistron did not respond to requests for comment while Foxconn said it does not comment on specific operations or work for a customer.  India\u2019s IT ministry also did not respond to a request for comment.  India last year banned more than 200 Chinese-origin mobile applications, saying they threatened the security of the country. It also announced new controls on telecoms gear purchases.  Cupertino, California-based Apple began the assembly of iPhones in India in 2017 and has since ramped up manufacturing operations via the local units of Foxconn and Wistron. Pegatron also set up a base in India last year.  Foxconn will invest up to $1 billion to expand a factory in southern India where the Taiwanese contract manufacturer assembles iPhones, Reuters reported previously.  The three Apple suppliers have also committed roughly $900 million over five years to make iPhones in India.

Apple Inc AAPL.O tumbled 6.6 percent, sending its market value below $1 trillion at the close, a day after the iPhone maker warned that sales for the crucial holiday quarter may miss expectations. Apple in August had become the first publicly listed U.S. company with a $1 trillion market value.  The forecast dragged down shares of Apple's U.S. suppliers, mostly chipmakers, and pushed the S&P technology sector .SPLRCT down 1.9 percent.  \u201cThe tone was set by Apple\u2019s earnings. That\u2019s clearly been a headwind all day,\u201d said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer, North Star Investment Management Corp, Chicago.  Kuby also cited weak earnings from Kraft Heinz as having an effect on the broader market. \u201cWith Kraft, you have two different types of companies that were disappointing,\u201d he said.  Remarks by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on CNBC about trade talks with China also dampened the mood. While President Donald Trump will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping this month, he has not asked U.S. officials to draw up a proposed trade plan, Kudlow said, contradicting a report earlier in the day that had buoyed hopes of a trade dispute resolution.  Stocks extended losses following Kudlow's comments, and the trade-sensitive S&P 500 industrial index .SPLRCI, which was up earlier in the session, closed down 0.3 percent.  \u201cThat tells you tariffs are still a factor, and from the reaction we saw there, that tells me it\u2019s a heavier weighting in the investment decision than what people were anticipating before,\u201d said Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc in San Antonio, which manages about $1.3 billion.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 109.91 points, or 0.43 percent, to 25,270.83, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 17.31 points, or 0.63 percent, to 2,723.06, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 77.06 points, or 1.04 percent, to 7,356.99.

For the week, the S&P 500 and Dow each rose 2.4 percent and the Nasdaq climbed 2.7 percent.  Economic data was healthy, with the Labor Department\u2019s payrolls report showing job growth rebounded sharply in October, pointing to further labor market tightening that could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise benchmark interest rates in December.  Shares of Kraft Heinz Co KHC.O fell 9.7 percent after the company missed quarterly earnings estimates and cited steep commodity costs, other expenses and pricing promotions that overshadowed higher-than-expected sales.  Other earnings reports were more upbeat.  Chevron Corp CVX.N gained 3.2 percent after reporting its quarterly profit doubled on record oil and gas production.  Starbucks Corp SBUX.O shares hit a record high and closed up 9.7 percent, a day after the coffee chain reported strong sales in the United States and China.  Overall, third-quarter results have been stronger than expected, with about 78 percent of the reports so far beating analysts\u2019 estimates, according to I\/B\/E\/S data from Refinitiv.  Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.07-to-1 ratio favored advancers.  The S&P 500 posted eight new 52-week highs and five new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 41 new highs and 53 new lows.  About 8.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges.

A Qualcomm sign is seen during the China International Import Expo (CIIE), at the National Exhibition and Convention Center in Shanghai, China November 7, 2018. REUTERS\/Aly Song  The International Trade Commission, a government agency empowered to hear disputes over patented technology, issued a final ruling in one case that went in Apple\u2019s favor while an ITC administrative judge made a non-binding recommendation that supported Qualcomm in another.  In both cases Qualcomm Inc sought to have imports of Apple Inc iPhone 7, 8 and X models containing chips made by Intel Corp banned. Because iPhones are made overseas, banning imports would choke Apple\u2019s sales of the phones in the United States.  The two American companies have been locked for two years in a legal dispute in which Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices. Qualcomm has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement.  \u201cQualcomm is using these cases to distract from having to answer for the real issues, their monopolistic business practices,\u201d Apple said in a statement.  After praising the first decision in its favor, Qualcomm said it would seek \u201creconsideration\u201d of the second decision because it was at odds with a jury trial that the chip supplier won earlier this month in federal court in San Diego, where jurors found Apple infringed three Qualcomm patents.  \u201cThe Commission\u2019s decision is inconsistent with the recent unanimous jury verdict finding infringement of the same patent after Apple abandoned its invalidity defense at the end of trial,\u201d Qualcomm said in a statement. \u201cWe will seek reconsideration by the Commission in view of the jury verdict.\u201d  Gaston Kroub, a patent lawyer in New York not involved in the cases, said Qualcomm\u2019s strategy at the ITC was to use the threat of an import ban to pressure Apple into reaching a settlement of all patent and antitrust claims between the companies.  \u201cQualcomm will be happy they got at least something, but at the end of day, with this final determination, Apple will be emboldened to think it can continue to ward off Qualcomm\u2019s attacks,\u201d Kroub said. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything here that would impact Apple\u2019s defense strategy.\u201d  The focus moves now to skirmishes that will likely be more important. A ruling is expected soon in an antitrust case brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission accusing Qualcomm of abusing a monopoly on mobile chip technology.  A case brought by Apple making similar claims goes to trial in April in California over allegations Qualcomm seeks inflated royalties for licensing its technology in violation of antitrust laws.  After the non-binding decision in Qualcomm\u2019s favor was announced on Tuesday, Apple shares closed down 1 percent to $186.79 in regular trading, and Qualcomm closed up 2.4 percent to $58.  But the stocks reversed direction in late trading after the announcement of the binding decision that favored Apple. Apple shares were up .73 percent and Qualcomm shares down .69 percent.  Qualcomm has filed lawsuits in the United States, China, Germany and other countries accusing iPhone of using its technology without authorization.  Qualcomm has won sales bans against Apple in China and Germany, though the China ban has not been enforced and Apple resumed sales of phones in Germany by shipping phones with only Qualcomm chips.  Apple has also racked up victories by having many of Qualcomm\u2019s patents invalidated, at least on a preliminary basis. And the chip supplier has been dealt setbacks in its FTC trial, where a pre-trial ruling forced it to license its technology to other chip firms.  Of the two cases decided on Tuesday by the ITC, the ruling favorable to Apple can only be appealed to a federal court. The ruling favorable to Qualcomm faces review by the full six-member ITC, which will make a final decision.","1111":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equities lost ground on Wednesday, snapping a three-day winning streak after the U.S. Federal Reserve held rates steady as expected but comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell cast doubt on whether the central bank\u2019s next move would be a rate cut.  FILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., February 13, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  The Fed made no move on interest rates as policymakers took heart in continued U.S. job gains and economic growth and held out hope that weak inflation will edge higher.  Stocks initially added to gains, U.S. Treasury yields fell and the dollar stayed weaker after the statement. However, all reversed course after comments from Powell suggesting a recent decline in inflation could be transitory.  Traders of U.S. short-term interest rate futures eased off on bets the Federal Reserve will cut rates before the end of the year, but are still expecting a cut by as early as the Fed\u2019s December meeting.  \u201cIn the statement the Fed worried about inflation being below their target, but in the press conference Powell said they view that weakness as transitory and they aren\u2019t leaning more towards a cut then they were before,\u201d said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Robert W.

Early gains were supported by gains in Apple, which rose more than 7% before closing up 4.91% as the top boost to each of the major indexes on Wall Street. The iPhone maker beat depressed expectations despite a record drop in phone revenue, gave an upbeat assessment of its China business, said it would buy back $75 billion in shares and hiked its dividend. The gains pushed Apple closer to $1-trillion market capitalization yet again.  (Graphic: Apple back in the $1 trillion race link: tmsnrt.rs\/2When53).

Margrethe Vestager\u2019s comments come after an EU questionnaire, seen by Reuters late last month, showed EU regulators had asked online merchants whether they had been told to use Apple Pay instead of competing services.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been asking quite a number of questions because we get many many concerns when it comes to Apple Pay for pure competition reasons,\u201d said EU Competition Commissioner Vestager, without specifying who had expressed concern.  \u201cPeople see it becomes increasingly difficult to compete in the market for easy payments,\u201d she told a news briefing at the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon.  In an interview with Reuters last year, Vestager said she might investigate Apple Pay if there were formal complaints. At least one party has gone to the European Commission with its grievance, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.  Apple Pay, which was launched in 2014 and is available in more than 50 countries including over 20 EU member states, marks Apple's AAPL.O diversification from sales of devices like iPhones and iPads.  Apple has previously said its payment system offers the safest solution in the market, as shown by the thousands of banks using it, and that iPhones offer users a choice of payment options, including credit and debit cards and bank apps.  Vestager, who retains the competition portfolio in the new Commission due to start work on Dec. 1, has gained a reputation as a tough enforcer especially against tech companies, handing out hefty fines and ordering them to change their practices.  In the next Commission she will have an expanded mandate which could see her take a more proactive role, including introducing new legislation to govern the technology sector.","1124":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window.)  * Fed keeps rates unchanged, adding to market gains  * Apple up as China sales steady, upbeat on accessories  * Indexes: Dow up 0.2%, S&P 500 off 0.2%, Nasdaq gains 0.5% (Updates to after Fed statement)  NEW YORK, May 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks added slightly to gains after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady and its policymakers said the economy was in good shape.

The benchmark S&P 500 is up about 10 percent from a 20-month low it touched around Christmas, boosted by hopes for a deal between the world\u2019s two largest economies, which eased some worries over the impact of the trade spat on global growth.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O on Monday unveiled software upgrades that would let older iPhones run faster, help parents limit their children's screen time and make its Siri voice assistant work more like a rival feature from Amazon.com AMZN.O.  Taken together, the moves announced at Apple\u2019s annual Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose amounted to focusing on keeping its base of 1.3 billion users satisfied with their devices and catching up with some competitors. Apple shares closed up 0.8 percent at $191.83 after the news, and rose to $192.40 in extended trading.  Apple faced a backlash late last year when it emerged that the company slowed down some older iPhones with flagging batteries. The latest version of Apple\u2019s operating system for the iPhone and iPad, iOS 12, will make older devices, such as the iPhone 6, work better.  Software chief Craig Federighi said iOS 12 could carry out simple tasks, such as opening apps, up to twice as fast as its predecessor, iOS 11. The new system will work on a range of products that date back to 2013.  The company also will allow broader use of in-app voice controls, which it had limited to a handful of apps, such as PayPal and Uber. Amazon, by contrast, was much more open to controlling apps with its Alexa assistant.  Apple also rolled out group video chat sessions with up to 32 users, putting it in direct competition with companies such as Cisco Systems Inc CSCO.O and Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O Skype.  In response to criticism that Apple contributed to computer overuse by children, iPhone and iPad users will now be able to limit the time children spend in apps, as well as which apps they can use.  Slideshow ( 12 images )  \u201cSome apps demand more of our attention than we might realize,\u201d Federighi said.  The parent control system sits atop a broader system that adults, too, can use to monitor and limit their screen time.  Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies, said the flexibility of Apple\u2019s system set it apart from others designed only for parental monitoring, offering the ability for teens and adults to impose their own limits.  \u201cIt\u2019s a clear admission from Apple: \u2018Our installed base is so big, and no two users are the same, so we\u2019re not going to tell you what works for you,\u2019\u201d she said.  New features help protect users\u2019 anonymity online. The company said its Safari web browser for both Macs and iPhones will keep users from being tracked without their permission by websites that use \u201clike\u201d or \u201cshare\u201d buttons from social media companies.  Apple unveiled new steps to make it hard for advertisers to distinguish among users, building on its effort, begun last year, to prevent such tracking.  Apple also rolled out new tools for augmented reality, saying users would be able to share worlds in games, for instance. LEGO, the maker of interlocking toy blocks, showed off an app in which two players using iPads could put out a virtual fire blazing on a physical house made of LEGOs.  Federighi said Apple had been working on a \u201cmulti-year\u201d effort to make it easier to move iPhone and iPad apps onto Mac computers, a significant change because Apple\u2019s iOS is often a top destination for developers, who frequently choose Android phones as the second platform.  Federighi said the tools will come out next year.","1131":"(Reuters) - A U.S. trade judge on Friday declined to block the importation of Apple Inc AAPL.O iPhones with chips from Intel Corp INTC.O, handing a major defeat to Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O in its high-stakes legal dispute with the iPhone maker.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  A U.S. International Trade Commission judge said Apple\u2019s phones infringed one Qualcomm patent related to power management technology, but denied the chipmaker\u2019s request for a ban on the import of some iPhones into the United States.  Thomas Pender, an administrative law judge at the ITC, said that \u201cpublic interest factors\u201d weighed against granting Qualcomm\u2019s request for a ban.  The determination will be reviewed by other judges. Qualcomm, the world\u2019s largest mobile phone chipmaker, has another pending patent case against Apple before the ITC.  Apple said in a statement that Qualcomm had unfairly demanded royalties for technologies it had nothing to do with.  \u201cWe\u2019re glad the ITC stopped Qualcomm\u2019s attempt to damage competition and ultimately harm innovators and U.S. consumers,\u201d Apple said.  In a statement, Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said the company was pleased the judge did find patent infringement, but \u201cit makes no sense to then allow infringement to continue by denying an import ban.  \u201cThat goes against the ITC mandate to protect American innovators by blocking the import of infringing products,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cThere are many ways Apple could stop infringing our technology without affecting the public interest.\u201d  Apple and Qualcomm are locked in a wide-ranging legal dispute in which Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices. Qualcomm has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement.  San Diego, California-based Qualcomm initiated an ITC case against Apple in July 2017, alleging that iPhones containing Intel chips infringed six patents describing technology that helps smartphones perform well without draining the battery.  Qualcomm did not allege that Intel chips violate its patents, but claimed that the way Apple implemented them in the iPhone does.  In a blog post on Friday after the ITC decision, Intel\u2019s general counsel, Steven Rodgers, said Qualcomm had \u201cpublicly disparaged Intel\u2019s products\u201d as inferior to Qualcomm\u2019s during the case.  \u201cIt is easy to say things, but Intel\u2019s track record is clear,\u201d Rodgers wrote in his post. \u201cEvery day, we push the boundaries of computing and communication technologies. And, the proof is in the pudding: last year, the U.S. Patent Office awarded more patents to Intel than to Qualcomm.\u201d  The ITC is a popular venue for patent disputes because it handles cases relatively quickly and can more easily bar an infringing product from the U.S. market than federal courts can.  Qualcomm dropped three of the six patents from the case before a trial that began in June.  Pender said in Friday\u2019s decision that Apple infringed only one of the three patents remaining in the case.","1132":"March 27 (Reuters) - Apple Inc:  * APPLE INTRODUCES NEW 9.7-INCH IPAD WITH APPLE PENCIL SUPPORT  * APPLE SAYS UPDATED ITS IPAD WITH SUPPORT FOR APPLE PENCIL PLUS EVEN GREATER PERFORMANCE, STARTING AT $329 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","1133":"June 24 (Reuters) - Apple Inc is set to shut seven of its retail locations in Houston, Texas again due to an increase in the number of novel coronavirus cases in the United States, Bloomberg News reported here on Wednesday.

FILE PHOTO: A Qualcomm sign is shown outside one of the company's many buildings in San Diego, California, U.S., September 17, 2020. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Qualcomm\u2019s shares were up 14% in extended trading.  The San Diego-based company is the biggest supplier of processors for smartphones and modem chips that connect phones to wireless data networks. It has invested heavily in developing lucrative 5G technology hoping to profit as it becomes mainstream in mobile phones, a trend poised to ramp up with the introduction of Apple\u2019s first 5G phones last month.  Revenue from the company\u2019s chip segment, its largest by sales, was $4.97 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, compared with FactSet estimates of $4.59 billion.  Qualcomm this year returned to being a major supplier for Apple, supplying chips that help the new iPhone 12 models connect to high-speed 5G networks. Apple did not give a forecast for its sales during the current quarter, making Qualcomm\u2019s chip sales one of the few proxies for investors to gauge the progress of the new iPhones.  But Qualcomm is supplying a broad swath of phone makers beyond Apple with 5G chips, which is driving revenue and profit growth. Apple\u2019s iPhone\u2019s launched a month later than usual, and, though he did not name Apple, Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf told Reuters in an interview that the contribution from new customer in the quarter was small.  \u201cThe results we just printed really include a smaller impact than you would normally see with one of the new customers that we\u2019re ramping up, just due to timing of their launch,\u201d he said.  Apple shares rose 0.6% after the announcement of Qualcomm\u2019s results.  Qualcomm said it shipped 162 million chips capable of wireless data connections during its fiscal fourth quarter, compared with FactSet estimates of 155.3 million.  Based on the shipments, the average selling price for chips was $30.9, higher than $29.3 in the previous quarter. That is in part because Qualcomm is increasingly paring its modem and processor chips with radio chips that drive up selling prices. Sales of those radio chips nearly doubled from the prior quarter to $852 million in the fourth quarter, helping drive adjusted earnings per share of $1.45 versus estimate of $1.17, according to Refinitiv data.  \u201cThis is really the 5G story showing up in a big way in our business,\u201d Mollenkopf said.  Qualcomm expects chip segment revenue in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.8 billion for the unit during the first quarter, ahead of FactSet estimates of $5.71 billion.  Qualcomm, which makes the bulk of profits from its licensing business, said revenue from the unit was $1.51 billion, above FactSet estimates of $1.30 billion.  The company said it expects overall current-quarter revenue of between $7.8 billion and $8.6 billion, compared with analysts\u2019 estimates of $7.15 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Mollenkopf told Reuters the company expects overall 5G handset shipments this calendar year to come in at the top of the company\u2019s expected range of 175 million to 225 million units. The company also raised its forecast for 5G handset shipments for 2021 to a midpoint of 500 million units.  He also said Qualcomm has applied for licenses from the United States government to ship chips to Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] but has received response yet from U.S. officials.","1137":"(Reuters) - The latest round of U.S. tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods could hit the Apple Watch, health trackers, streaming music speakers and other accessories assembled in China, government rulings on tariffs show.  The rulings name Apple Inc's AAPL.O watch, several Fitbit Inc FIT.N activity trackers and connected speakers from Sonos Inc. While consumer technology's biggest sellers such as mobile phones and laptops so far have faced little danger of import duties, the rulings show that gadget makers are unlikely to be spared altogether and may have to consider price hikes on products that millions of consumers use every day.  The devices have all been determined by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol officials to fall under an obscure subheading of data transmission machines in the sprawling list of U.S. tariff codes. And that particular subheading is included in the more than 6,000 such codes in President Donald Trump\u2019s most recent round of proposed tariffs released earlier this month.  That $200 billion list of tariffs is in a public comment period. But if the list goes into effect this fall, the products from Apple, Fitbit and Sonos could face a 10 percent tariff.  The specific products listed in customs rulings are the original Apple Watch; Fitbit\u2019s Charge, Charge HR and Surge models; and Sonos\u2019s Play:3, Play:5 and SUB speakers.  All three companies declined to comment on the proposed tariff list. But in its filing earlier this month to become a publicly traded company, Sonos said that \u201cthe imposition of tariffs and other trade barriers, as well as retaliatory trade measures, could require us to raise the prices of our products and harm our sales.\u201d  The New York Times has reported that Trump told Apple CEO Tim Cook during a meeting in May that the U.S. government would not levy tariffs on iPhones assembled in China, citing a person familiar with the meeting.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cThe way the president has been using his trade authority, you have direct examples of him using his authority to target specific products and companies,\u201d said Sage Chandler, vice president for international trade policy at the Consumer Technology Association.  The toll from tariffs on the gadget world\u2019s smaller product lines could be significant. Sonos and Fitbit do not break out individual product sales, but collectively they had $2.6 billion in revenue last year. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimates that the Apple Watch alone will bring in $9.9 billion in sales this year, though that estimate includes sales outside the United States that the tariff would not touch.  It is possible that the products from Apple, Fitbit and Sonos no longer fall under tariff codes in the $200 billion list, trade experts said. The codes applied to specific products are only public knowledge because their makers asked regulators to rule on their proper classification. And some of the products have been replaced by newer models that could be classified differently.  But if companies have products whose tariff codes are on the list, they have three options, experts said: Advocate to get the code dropped from the list during the public comment period, apply for an exclusion once tariffs go into effect, or try to have their products classified under a different code not on the list.  The last option could prove difficult due to the thousands of codes covered, said one former U.S. trade official.

Apple said in the report that the proportion of \u201clow performers,\u201d or suppliers scoring less than 59 points on its 100-point scale, fell to 1 percent in 2017 from 3 percent in 2016 and 14 percent in 2014. \u201cHigh performers\u201d with scores of more than 90 rose to a record high of 59 percent from 47 percent the year before.  Apple found 44 \u201ccore violations\u201d of its labor rules in 2017, double the previous year. Those included three instances of employees forced to pay excessive fees for a job, a practice Apple banned in 2015.  In one case, over 700 foreign contract workers recruited from the Philippines were charged a total of $1 million to work for a supplier. Apple said it forced the supplier to repay the money.  Compliance with Apple\u2019s 60-hour work week fell to 94 percent of suppliers from 98 percent in 2016. Apple said it uncovered 38 cases of falsification of working hours data in 2017, up from nine cases the year before.  When Apple finds such falsifications, it notifies the chief executive of the supplier, puts the supplier on probation until a fix is implemented and conducts reviews to make sure the fix prevents future violations.  \u201cWe\u2019re committed to raising the bar every year across our supply chain,\u201d Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, Jeff Williams, said in a release.  Apple said the increase was driven by the fact that it brought on a number of new suppliers in 2017 and started tracking the working hours data of 1.3 million supplier employees, 30 percent more than in previous years.  In the report, Apple also said it was launching a women\u2019s\u2019 health initiative at its supplier plants, with a goal of reaching 1 million women by 2020. It said it had launched a program in China to train workers to become factory line leaders, who often make 20 percent to 30 percent more than line workers.  On Wednesday, Apple also issued its conflict minerals report, which is required by United States securities regulators. The report lists suppliers of sensitive metals such as tin and gold.  Apple said 16 smelters and refiners left its supply chain in 2017, 10 of which were dropped because they would not participate in a third-party audit of their practices. Six left of their own accord.  Apple also outlined new rules on student labor after a discovery last year that some Chinese students were working more than 11 hours a day assembling the iPhone X.","1140":"FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, New York, U.S., October 16, 2019.

REUTERS\/Stephen Nellis  CAMPBELL, California (Reuters) - For over 14 years at Apple Inc, Rub\u00e9n Caballero had to include a cable with every iPhone design whose wireless engineering he oversaw, from the first prototypes in 2005 to iPhone 11 models on shelves now.  Now, as chief wireless strategist for Silicon Valley startup Keyssa Inc, Caballero hopes to cut the cord for good - for all smartphones. His new position has not been previously reported.  Every iPhone since the first released in 2007 has come with a cable as a failsafe way to transfer data, as has virtually every other brand of phone.  Keyssa wants to end that with its chip that can transfer data nearly as fast as a wire by placing two devices next to each other. Early customer LG Electronics Inc uses the chip to connect the second screen of its LG V50 smart phone.  Wireless charging has taken hold in phones, but wireless data connections like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi remain too finicky to discard cables altogether.  Keyssa has raised more than $100 million from the venture groups at Intel Corp, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Foxconn parent Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd and Future Shape, a fund run by Tony Fadell, another former Apple executive who helped create the iPod and then hired Caballero for the original iPhone team.

Camera modules connect to main circuit boards with a thin cables. Bend them enough and they break, creating an unintentional \u201cbeautiful antenna\u201d that interferes with cellular data connections, Caballero said.  With Keyssa\u2019s chips, camera modules could touch the circuit board to transmit data wirelessly. The chips use high frequencies that cause no interference inside the phone or with nearby devices.  \u201cWhat\u2019s beautiful about this is the frequency,\u201d Caballero said. \u201cIt just fixes a lot of problems.\u201d  Aside from phones, Keyssa is testing chips with video display makers and at least one maker of lidar sensors, the electronic eyes of self-driving cars.  \u201cRuben is a powerhouse when it comes to commercializing great technology,\u201d Fadell told Reuters.  Caballero brings with him experience overseeing more than 1,000 Apple wireless engineers in a department with a budget of $600 million for testing equipment alone.  Before joining Apple, Caballero worked at two startups and relished the frenzied pace there and during his early days at Apple working with Fadell.

The much anticipated titanium credit card, part of a broader effort by Apple to derive greater revenue from services after years of heavy reliance on iPhone sales, was launched in August, in partnership with Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N.  In an email, Goldman said Apple Card applicants were evaluated independently, according to income and creditworthiness, taking into account factors such as personal credit scores and personal debt.  It was possible for two family members to receive significantly different credit decisions, the bank said, but added, \u201cWe have not, and will not, make decisions based on factors like gender.\u201d  Hansson, who is the creator of web-application framework Ruby on Rails, did not disclose any specific income-related information for himself or his wife but tweeted that they filed joint tax returns and that his wife had a better credit score.  On Saturday, Wozniak chimed in with a similar experience, saying he got 10 times more credit on the card, compared with his wife.  \u201cWe have no separate bank or credit card accounts or any separate assets,\u201d Wozniak said on Twitter, in reply to Hansson\u2019s original tweet.  \u201cHard to get to a human for a correction though. It\u2019s big tech in 2019.\u201d  New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services said it was beginning an inquiry into Goldman Sachs\u2019 credit card practices.  \"New York law prohibits discrimination against protected classes of individuals,\" Linda Lacewell, the superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, wrote in a blog post. (bit.ly\/2Ny1TUA)  That barred an algorithm, like any other method of determining creditworthiness, from disparate treatment based on individual characteristics such as age, creed, race, color, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, among others, she added.  \u201cWe know the question of discrimination in algorithmic decisioning also extends to other areas of financial services.\u201d  Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Sunday.","1153":"* Apple supplier Lumentum plunges after slashing outlook  * Apple shares dip, other iPhone suppliers also hit  * GE shares fall below $8 for first time since 2009  * Goldman Sachs leads losers on the Dow  * Indexes down: Dow 2 pct, S&P 1.7 pct, Nasdaq 2.4 pct (Updates to late afternoon, changes byline, adds NEW YORK to dateline)  NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Wall Street\u2019s major indexes fell on Monday, with the S&P 500 weighed by technology and financial stocks as shares of Apple Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc came under pressure.

Under the deal, about 2,200 Intel employees will join Apple, along with intellectual property, equipment and leases. Combined with its existing portfolio, Apple will have 17,000 wireless technology patents, ranging from cellular communication standards to modems, making it a more powerful player in global licensing talks that will likely take place between major 5G patent holders such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.  Intel shares rose 5.7% to $55.05 after the news and the company\u2019s report that its earnings beat analysts\u2019 expectations. Apple shares edged up 0.1% to $207.29.  After the deal, Intel will retain the right to develop modems for non-smartphone applications, such as PCs, industrial equipment and self-driving cars.  Modem chips connect devices like the iPhone to wireless data networks, but Apple has always relied on outside suppliers for the part. Intel positioned itself as the sole source of iPhone modem chips over the past year after Apple got into a prolonged legal fight with previous supplier Qualcomm Inc over Qualcomm patent licensing practices.  Cupertino, California-based Apple reached a surprise settlement in April that called for the iPhone to once again use Qualcomm modem chips. Within hours, Intel said it would quit the smartphone modem business.  Apple\u2019s acquisitions have mostly been much smaller companies, making the Intel deal its second-largest ever after its $3.2 billion purchase of Beats Electronics in 2014.  The deal with Intel will bolster Apple\u2019s goal to make its own modem chip. Two of Apple\u2019s biggest global rivals - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Huawei - already have the ability to self-supply modem chips.  Technology news publication The Information last year reported Apple\u2019s efforts to develop its own modem, but the iPhone maker has never formally acknowledged it. In February, Reuters reported that Apple moved its modem engineering efforts into the same chip design unit that makes the custom processors for its devices, signaling a doubling down on the pursuit of self-designed modem chip.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Apple is seen at a store in Zurich, Switzerland January 3, 2019. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has also long said the company wants to control its own technological fate, what analysts have called the \u201cCook Doctrine.\u201d  \u201cWe believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products that we make,\u201d Tim Cook told investors back in 2009.  SPEEDING UP DEVELOPMENT  The purchase of Intel\u2019s assets could help Apple meet its aggressive timeline for producing a modem.  A person familiar with the matter said Apple plans to use Qualcomm\u2019s modem technology for a 5G iPhone in 2020 but wants to have an internally developed 5G modem technology ready for use in some of its products by 2021. Intel previously disclosed plans to have a 5G modem ready by 2020, so tapping the Intel assets could help Apple hit its target.  But any replacement of Qualcomm is likely to happen in phases, this person said, as Apple builds up its ability to ensure that its modems work on all the networks and countries where Apple sells phones. Ensuring worldwide compatibility is Qualcomm\u2019s historical strength, and Apple might still have to rely on Qualcomm for some modems during a transition period to its own devices.  \u201cThere\u2019s a fierce desire (at Apple) to have Independence, but they also realize it has to be done responsibly,\u201d this person said.  Apple\u2019s license deal with Qualcomm lasts six years and its accompanying chip supply agreement could also last that long, said one chip industry veteran who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters. Apple is likely to continue to use the San Diego firm\u2019s chips in its flagship models even if it phases in its own silicon for lower-end and older models, this person said.  Apple has engaged with Taiwan\u2019s Global Unichip Corp, a chip design house in which Apple supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is an investor, to explore a modem design, but the work is in early stages.  \u201cClearly Apple saw the handwriting on the wall, because they came around and did a deal with Qualcomm,\u201d this person said.  Apple declined to comment on its plans, and Qualcomm and Global Unichip did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  PATENTS AS LEVERAGE  The most valuable aspect of the Intel deal for Apple could turn out to be patents. To sell a 5G iPhone, Apple will need to strike deals with the major holders of 5G patents, including Nokia, Ericsson, Huawei and Qualcomm. Apple executed a licensing deal with Qualcomm, but it has not disclosed whether it has deals in place with the others.  Erick Robinson, a patent attorney who had worked in Qualcomm\u2019s licensing division in Asia, said the patents could give Apple better leverage in licensing talks.  \u201cI don\u2019t think Intel has quite the portfolio that Qualcomm has, but they certainly have a large enough one to impact the valuations when it comes to a cross-licensing deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll save (Apple) a huge chunk of change in cross-license deals.\u201d","1155":"* Apple will miss quarterly revenue target due to coronavirus  * European stocks seen falling 0.5-0.6%  * S&P500 futures down 0.35%  * Australian dollar falls; gold, U.S. bonds gain  * Euro near three-year low before German ZEW data  *  LONDON, Feb 18 (Reuters) - World stocks markets were knocked off record highs on Tuesday as two of the world\u2019s mega companies reported damage from the coronavirus outbreak.  Apple\u2019s stock fell almost 6% in Frankfurt and all Europe\u2019s main markets fell after the iPhone maker warned it was unlikely to meet the March quarter sales guidance it had set just three weeks ago.  HSBC announced a massive restructuring that involved shedding $100 billion of assets and slashing 35,000 jobs over three years. It also warned about the impact of the coronavirus on its Asia business.

The warning from Apple sobered investors who had hoped stimulus from China and other countries would protect the global economy from the effects of the epidemic.  Europe\u2019s 0.4% to 0.5% declines came after Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei dropped 1.4% as tech stocks globally reacted to Apple\u2019s warning. China\u2019s CSI300 gave up 0.5% after gaining on Monday, encouraged by a central bank rate cut and government stimulus hopes.  S&P 500 e-mini futures slipped 0.4% and Nasdaq futures fell 0.6%.  Bonds were in demand, with the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield falling 4 basis point to just above 1.5%. Safe-haven gold rose to its highest in two weeks and oil prices fell nearly 2% after five days of gains.  The yen rose 0.15% to 109.69 yen per dollar while the risk- and China-sensitive Australian dollar lost 0.4% to $0.6686 . The yuan was steadier, trading at 6.9950 per dollar .  The euro was near a three-year low versus the dollar at $1.0830, before Germany\u2019s ZEW survey, which is expected to fuel growing pessimism about Europe\u2019s largest economy.  Also hurting market sentiment were a reports that U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration was considering changing regulations to allow it to block shipments of chips to China\u2019s Huawei from companies such as Taiwan\u2019s Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker.

The number of new coronavirus cases in mainland China fell below 2,000 for the first time since January, but the virus remains far from contained. The death toll in China has climbed to 1,868, the National Health Commission said, and the World Health Organization said \u201cevery scenario is still on the table\u201d in terms of the epidemic\u2019s evolution.  As China\u2019s authorities try to prevent the spread of the disease, the economy is paying a heavy price. Some cities remain locked down, streets are deserted, and travel bans and quarantine orders are preventing migrant workers from getting back to their jobs.  Many factories have yet to re-open, disrupting supply chains in China and beyond, as highlighted by Apple.  \u201cApple is saying its recovery could be delayed, which could mean the impact of the virus may go beyond the current quarter,\u201d said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.  \u201cIf Apple shares were traded cheaply, that might not matter much. But when they are trading at a record high, investors will be surely tempted to sell.\u201d","1156":"May 1 (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday beat revenue and profit expectations in its March quarter as it sold 52.2 million iPhones, barely below Wall Street targets and showing some resilience as global demand for smartphones wanes.  The company also predicted a revenue range of $51.5 billion to $53.5 billion for the June quarter, with a midpoint ahead of the $51.6 billion Wall Street expected.  Apple also boosted its capital return program by $100 billion, with repurchases from the increase set to begin in the June quarter, and said it bought $23.5 billion of stock back in the March quarter, a sign that it is bringing back most of its hundreds of billions of dollars in cash to the United States.  The share repurchases in the march quarter drove Apple\u2019s cash net of debt down slightly to $145 billion.  \u201cWe are returning the cash to investors as we have promised,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters in an interview.  Apple has been at a challenging crossroads this year with sales of its flagship iPhone X disappointing many observers. Investors have watched Apple closely in recent weeks as a string of poor forecasts from the smartphone supply chain signaled that iPhone demand may be lower than previously expected. They have also been watching carefully for signs of what Apple plans to do with its hundreds of billions of dollars in cash.  Apple posted revenue for its March quarter of $61.1 billion, up from $52.9 billion last year. Wall Street expected $60.8 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S. The company sold 52.2 million iPhones versus expectations of 52.3 million, according to data from Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S, up from 50.7 million last year.  Average selling prices for iPhones were $728, compared with Wall Street expectations of $742. Maestri told Reuters that clearing channel inventory of 1.8 million iPhones - most of them iPhone X and iPhone 8 models - accounted for some of the difference.  Profits were $2.73 per share versus expectations of $2.68 per share and up from $2.10 a year ago.  The company forecasted a midpoint of $52.5 billion in revenue for the June quarter, beating analyst expectations of $51.6 billion.  Apple\u2019s services business, which includes Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud, posted $9.1 billion in revenue compared with expectations of $8.3 billion. Heading into earnings, investors were hopeful that growth in that segment could help offset the cooling global smartphone market.  Apple traditionally updates its share buy-back and dividend program each spring, and the $100 billion it added this year compares with an increase of $50 billion last year. The company also increased its quarterly dividend 16 percent, compared with a 10.5 percent increase last year.  In February, Apple said it planned to draw down its excess cash, though Chief Executive Tim Cook had downplayed the possibility of a special dividend.  But investors have had concerns around Apple because of a brewing trade tensions with China. While there has not yet been a tariff on devices such as Apple\u2019s iPhone, Cook last week traveled to Washington to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House to discuss trade matters.  \u201cWe believe tariffs at the end of the day are a tax on the consumer,\u201d Maestri said.  Apple has been emphasizing its contributions to the U.S. economy in recent months, outlining a $30 billion U.S. spending plan and highlighting the tens of billions of dollars it spends each year with U.S.-based suppliers.  In recent months, Apple has been emphasizing the size of its overall user base, which includes used iPhones, rather than focusing strictly on new device sales, a sign of the increasing importance of making money off users without selling them new hardware.  Apple shares have dropped 0.1 percent this year and closed at $169.10 on Tuesday, down 1.8 percent from their price of $172.26 at the start of the year. Their performance lags the NASDAQ Composite Index, which was up 3.3 percent for the year.","1157":"March 12 (Reuters) - Apple Inc:  * APPLE SAYS IT IS ACQUIRING DIGITAL MAGAZINE SERVICE TEXTURE Source text: apple.co\/2DlSiI4 Further company coverage:","1158":"* European shares open firmly in red; Frankfurt leads fallers  * Wall Street futures point to weak open  * Apple\u2019s Frankfurt shares down more than 8 pct  * Currency \u2018flash crash\u2019 sends yen soaring  LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Apple\u2019s rare warning on revenue rocked financial markets on Thursday, as investors sought safety in bonds and less risky assets amid renewed concerns about slowing global economic and corporate growth.  Asian and European shares fell sharply, led by a sell-off in technology stocks, and U.S. equity futures pointed to a weaker open on Wall Street after Apple cut its revenue forecast, its first downgrade in nearly 12 years, blaming weaker iPhone sales in China.  The news also jolted currency markets and German government bond yields held close to their lowest in over two years.  \u201cFor the moment, investors have reacted by going into non-risky assets,\u201d said Philippe Waechter, chief economist at Ostrum Asset Management, in Paris.  \u201cNo one wants to take any risk because none of the uncertainties we are facing have been lifted, whether it\u2019s Brexit, this trade war, or growth. Investors are putting their heads in the sand and waiting.\u201d  Apples shares tumbled in after-hours trade and those listed in Frankfurt were down 8.6 percent in early European deals.  The news sparked a \u2018flash crash\u2019 in holiday-thinned currency markets as growing concerns about the health of the global economy, particularly in China, sent investors scurrying into the safe-haven of the Japanese yen, which was poised for its biggest daily rise in 20 months.  Apple\u2019s warning came after data earlier this week showed a deceleration in factory activity in China and the euro zone, indicating the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China was taking a toll on global manufacturing.  Major European bourses were firmly in negative territory by midmorning - Frankfurt\u2019s DAX, with its exposure to Chinese trade and tech-heavy constituents, was the biggest faller and down as much as 1.2 percent, while Paris\u2019 CAC40 dropped 1.1 percent and London eased 0.4 percent.  Chipmakers who supply parts to Apple were the worst hit, sending technology stocks to their lowest since February 2017.  U.S. stock futures pointed to another rough start on Wall Street, with Nasdaq E-minis down 2.7 percent and S&P 500 E-minis off 1.6 percent.  Overnight, shares in China and Hong Kong see-sawed between gains and losses as investors braced for Beijing to roll out fresh support measures for the cooling Chinese economy.  \u201cChinese authorities have got the luxury of having control not just of the fiscal parts of the government tool case, but also the monetary parts ... and I suspect the Chinese authorities will use that,\u201d said Jim McCafferty, head of equity research, Asia ex-Japan, at Nomura.  China\u2019s central bank said late on Wednesday it was adjusting policy to benefit more small firms that are having trouble obtaining financing, in its latest move to ease strains on the private sector, a key job creator.  While more fiscal and monetary policy support had been expected in coming months on top of modest measures last year, some analysts wonder if more forceful stimulus will be needed to stabilise the world\u2019s second-largest economy.  \u2018FLASH CRASH\u2019  Currency markets saw a wild spike in volatility in early Asian trade, with the yen moving sharply higher against the U.S. dollar, breaking key technical levels and triggering stop-loss sales of U.S. and Australian dollars.  The dollar was last 1 percent weaker against the yen at 107.77, having earlier fallen as low as 104.96, its lowest level since March 2018. The Australian dollar at one point hit levels against the Japanese yen not seen since 2011.  The euro was up 0.3 percent, buying $1.1375, and the dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of major rivals, was 0.3 percent weaker at 96.52.  Germany\u2019s 10-year bond yield was most recently at 0.185 percent, after hitting a session low of 0.148 percent .  U.S. crude oil fell 0.9 percent to $46.12 a barrel, and Brent crude was down 0.2 percent at $54.82. Slowing global growth is expected to coincide with an increase in crude supply, depressing prices.

On Monday, the company led by Tim Cook raised another $8.5 billion, issuing bonds at some of the lowest interest rates it has paid in years, including three-year paper with a miserly 0.75% coupon. That\u2019s thanks to the willingness of the Federal Reserve to backstop debt markets.  The Fed\u2019s programs are designed to help companies struggling with the impact of the coronavirus top up their cash coffers, something beleaguered aircraft producer Boeing did with a massive $25 billion bond issue last week \u2013 enough to eschew government aid. Apple, though bruised by the economic and supply-chain damage wrought by the coronavirus, has no need to borrow more.

The U.S. specialty materials and chemicals outfit run by Ed Breen is battening down the hatches for a tough second quarter, particularly in its automotive segment. The $30 billion-odd company, one of the three listed groups that were part of DowDuPont until last year, has bolstered its balance sheet and liquidity and increased its cost-cutting target.  One brighter spot is in disposable gear for health workers \u2013 the personal protective equipment or PPE that\u2019s in demand around the world. DuPont sold 55% more Tyvek gowns and the like in the first quarter than a year earlier, upping output by more than 9 million per month \u2013 more than double production in any previous crisis, the company said. It won\u2019t make up for the losses elsewhere, though. The grand value-creating vision behind the merger that created DowDuPont and its three-way split is looking very fuzzy. (By Richard Beales)  NO MORE DRAMA. The U.S. Treasury Department said on Monday that it will borrow an unprecedented $3 trillion this quarter, mostly to fund virus-related aid. That\u2019s a good excuse to close the curtain on the archaic debt ceiling, which allows Congress to set the borrowing limit for money the U.S. government has already spent.  It has become a political cudgel, raising the specter of a U.S. default and a government shutdown every few years unless it has increased or, as it currently is until next year, suspended.  Some deficit hawks have tried to use the limit to impose fiscal discipline. But that charade largely ended even before the pandemic: Federal debt held by the public hit almost 80% of GDP at the end of the last fiscal year. That could jump to 101% by the end of this one. It\u2019s time to end the act. (By Gina Chon)  M&A LIFELINE. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles\u2019, plan to merge with Peugeot is throwing both carmakers a lifeline. The Italian-American maker of Jeep said on Tuesday that its adjusted operating profit fell 95% in the first quarter from a year earlier because of the collapse in car demand caused by the coronavirus. While Fiat declined to give guidance for the full year, it expects a significant loss in the second quarter.  Car production is gradually restarting in Italy and the United States. Consumers are, however, unlikely to snap up expensive items such as autos when their employment prospects are grim. The imperative to cut costs, which pre-dates the pandemic, is now crucial to survival. Fiat and Peugeot have promised to deliver 3.7 billion euros in annual savings through their tie-up. The sooner these are realised, the better. (By Lisa Jucca)  LONG-TERM GREEDY. Macquarie\u2019s boss is trying to see past the Covid-19 devastation. Shemara Wikramanayake opened the bank\u2019s annual conference for Australian companies on Tuesday arguing that trends such as urbanisation, climate change and digitisation will drive demand for infrastructure, renewable energy and technology. And on the same day the government estimated that containment efforts are costing the economy $2.4 billion a week, she said the country can emerge from the crisis in good shape, partly thanks to many successful corporate capital calls.  Funnily enough, Macquarie gets paid to help issue equity and its business model hinges on financing roads, ports, wind farms and such. With the bank\u2019s shares down by a third from their peak in February, it\u2019s no wonder Wikramanayake wants to keep the focus beyond the virus horizon. Of course, just because she\u2019s talking her book doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s wrong. (By Jeffrey Goldfarb)  PANDEMIC THRIFT. EssilorLuxottica has rediscovered the value of saving in a crisis. Faced with a 10% revenue contraction in the first quarter, the world\u2019s biggest maker of frames and optical lenses has cancelled dividends, buybacks and non-crucial investments. That\u2019s smart if it wants to carry out a planned cash acquisition of optical retailer GrandVision while also coping with severe Covid-19 disruptions.  The 7 billion euro price tag, agreed in July last year, does not look cheap given the collapse in stock markets since then. And EssilorLuxottica said on Tuesday that it expects the second quarter to be even worse than the first. Its net debt of 4.8 billion euros, now comfortably just above 1 times EBITDA, could be pushed up to 3 times that measure by year end, says Morningstar. Luckily, the French-Italian group is sitting on a 4.9 billion euro liquidity pot and has pre-funded most of the GrandVision acquisition cost. Continuing to keep a lean profile in the crisis is the right approach. (By Lisa Jucca)  LIVIN\u2019 ON A PRAIRIE. Beiersdorf\u2019s investors are down on their luck.

Chief Executive Stefan De Loecker said he will stick with the company\u2019s one-year-old investment programme but said little on its progress, suggesting he\u2019s less than even halfway there.  The multi-year scheme was supposed to help Beiersdorf access new markets, and boost innovation, digitalisation and workforce training. But so far it\u2019s failing to protect its brands. Sales of luxury skincare line La Prairie fell 36% because it couldn\u2019t be sold in airports, lagging behind L\u2019Oreal brands for which e-commerce strategies softened the blow.

AMS, known for supplying Apple AAPL.O with sensors for iPhones, wants to build a leader in integrated sensors and lights and develop systems for self-driving cars and smartphone applications.  After failing with a first offer at the same price but with a higher threshold of 62.5%, investors had been uncertain whether the second try would be successful, with hedge funds thought to hold around a third of Osram shares days before the offer period expired on Thursday.  Osram shareholders who have not yet tendered their stock, can still do so in an extended acceptance period that will last until Dec. 24. Market sources expect index funds, which they say hold around 10% in Osram, to use that window to sell their stake.  Osram, whose lightbulbs were once ubiquitous in European homes, became a takeover target after its attempt to turn itself into a specialist in the technology of generating and harnessing light using photons did not bring the hoped-for success. Hit by slow demand for car headlights, it reported a loss for the fiscal year that ended in September.  In the years to come, large job cuts seem unavoidable, even though AMS is ready to apply an employment protection scheme until end-2022 on the Osram sites in Germany.  AMS currently employs around 8,500 staff, Osram 23,500.  AMS plans to hold an extraordinary shareholders meeting in January to get approval for a 1.6 billion euro capital increase to fund the acquisition.  The final number of Osram shares tendered is expected to be published on Jan. 2, it said.","1162":"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Everyone knows that the global corporate tax system needs to be overhauled, Apple AAPL.O Chief Executive Tim Cook said on Monday, backing changes to global rules that are currently under consideration.  FILE PHOTO: Apple's CEO Tim Cook speaks with Singapore Paralympian Theresa Goh (unseen) at the OCBC Aquatic Centre, Singapore Sports Hub December 12, 2019. REUTERS\/Edgar Su  The growth of internet giants such as Apple has pushed international tax rules to the limit, prompting the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to pursue global reforms over where multinational firms should be taxed.  The reforms being examined center around the booking of profits by multinational firms in low-tax countries such as Ireland where they have bases - and where Cook was speaking on Monday - rather than where most of their customers are.  \u201cI think logically everybody knows it needs to be rehauled, I would certainly be the last person to say that the current system or the past system was the perfect system. I\u2019m hopeful and optimistic that they (the OECD) will find something,\u201d Cook said.  \u201cIt\u2019s very complex to know how to tax a multinational... We desperately want it to be fair,\u201d the Apple CEO added after receiving an inaugural award from the Irish state agency responsible for attracting foreign companies recognizing the contribution of multinationals in the country.  Apple is one of Ireland\u2019s largest multinational employers with 6,000 workers and both it and the Irish government have gone to court to fight a European Union order that Apple must pay 13 billion euros ($14.41 billion) in back taxes to Dublin.  The appeal to the EU\u2019s second-highest court began in September and could run for years. Cook said Apple\u2019s belief that \u201claw should not retrofitted\u201d was at the heart of the case and that the company had great faith in the justice system.  Apple\u2019s commitment to Ireland, which became its first European operation in 1980, was \u201cunshakable\u201d, Cook said.  The Apple chief executive also said that more regulation was needed in the area of privacy and must go further than the 2018 European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) privacy laws that handed regulators there significantly more powers.  \u201cI think more regulation is needed in this area, it is probably strange for a business person to be talking about regulation but it has become apparent that companies will not self-police in this area,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe were one of the first to endorse GDPR, we think it is overall extremely good, not only for Europe. We think it\u2019s necessary but not sufficient. You have to go further and that further is required to get privacy back to where it should be.\u201d","1163":"SEOUL, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor and Apple Inc plan to sign a partnership deal on autonomous electric cars by March and start production as early as 2024 in the United States, local newspaper Korea IT News reported on Sunday.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Apple and Google, whose operating systems power 99% of smart phones, said last month they would work together to create a system for notifying people who have been near others who have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The companies plan to allow only public health authorities to use the technology.  Both companies said privacy and preventing governments from using the system to compile data on citizens was a primary goal. The system uses Bluetooth signals from phones to detect encounters and does not use or store GPS location data.  But the developers of official coronavirus-related apps in several U.S. states told Reuters last month it was vital they be allowed to use GPS location data in conjunction with the new contact tracing system to track how outbreaks move and identify hotspots.  The Apple-Google decision to not allow GPS data collection with their contact tracing system will require public health authorities that want to access GPS location to rely on what Apple and Google have described as unstable, battery-draining workarounds.  Alternatives likely would miss some encounters because iPhones and Android devices turn off Bluetooth connections after some time for battery-saving and other reasons unless users remember to re-activate them.  But some apps said they planned to stick to their own approaches.  Software company Twenty, which developed the state of Utah\u2019s Healthy Together contact tracing app with both GPS and Bluetooth, said on Monday the app \u201coperates effectively\u201d without the new Apple-Google tool.  \u201cIf their approach can be more effective than our current solution, we\u2019ll eagerly incorporate their features into our existing application, provided it meets the specifications of current and prospective public health partners,\u201d Twenty said.  Canada\u2019s Alberta province, which does not collect GPS data, said it has no plans to adopt the Apple-Google system for its ABTraceTogether app.  Privacy experts have warned that any cache of location data related to health issues could make businesses and individuals vulnerable to being ostracized if the data is exposed.  Apple and Google also said Monday they will allow only one app per country to use the contact system, to avoid fragmentation and encourage wider adoption. The companies said they would, however, support countries that opt for a state or regional approach, and that U.S. states will be allowed to use the system.","1165":"","1166":"June 8 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes opened lower on Friday led by falls in shares of Apple and its suppliers, including Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm, following a report that the iPhone maker was planning to produce fewer new phones this year than last.

FILE PHOTO: New iPhone X phones are purchased at an Apple Store in Beijing, China November 3, 2017. REUTERS\/Damir Sagolj\/File Photo  On Tuesday evening in China, hours before Apple\u2019s earnings, China\u2019s official state broadcaster railed against the firm in a 30-minute special report, accusing it of allowing illegal content, including gambling apps, onto its platform.  The program was one of at least five reports by state media that targeted the company in the past week.  Although Beijing has criticized Apple before, the attacks highlight an increasingly fraught balancing act for the firm in the world\u2019s biggest smartphone market, where trade friction, tighter regulations and fierce competition threaten robust consumer appetite for its iPhones and other products.  Mo Jia, an analyst at industry tracker Canalys, said the reports needed to be seen as part of the U.S.-China trade conflict, noting tensions over a U.S. ban imposed on telecommunications equipment maker ZTE Corp 0763.HK000063.SZ that has yet to be lifted.  \u201cThe Chinese government is maybe trying to warn the U.S. government in a similar way by saying, your tech firm in China is not that safe either,\u201d he said.  The Trump administration has upped the ante in its trade war with Beijing - considering a 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. That prompted China on Wednesday to say \u201cblackmail\u201d wouldn\u2019t work and to threaten to hit back.  The criticism of Apple also comes ahead of a new campaign by the country\u2019s regulators to clean up spam and unsolicited calls, which are a pervasive issue in China where phone numbers are often sold on black markets.  The 18-month campaign was announced on Monday and starts in July. Apple has been specifically mentioned in some reports about such problems.  \u201cMajor communication operators in China have little ability to prevent such spam messages, since (Apple) says it has no right to monitor user messages out of privacy concerns,\u201d the People\u2019s Daily said last week.  Apple declined to comment on the state media reports while a fax to the Chinese internet regulator requesting comment did not receive a response.  BIG SPENDERS  Like its performance in other regions, much of the 19 percent revenue growth in China for the last quarter was led by the price hike for the iPhone X. It retails for 9,605 yuan ($1,415) in China - a price tag that doesn\u2019t appear to be fazing the Chinese smartphone consumer.  Apple\u2019s efforts to alter the iPhone X\u2019s appearance and new features such as facial recognition have gone down well - a contrast to the iPhone 7 which had a less substantive upgrade and led to a sharp China sales decline in 2016 for the firm.  \u201cI had to buy the X, not even the 8, because it has a better camera, a larger screen, and also for the face recognition,\u201d said an 18-year-old college student who gave her first name as Feifei.  But the question of brand loyalty always looms large in China, particularly at a time when state media has stepped up its criticism.  \u201cChances are I may have to shift to a domestic smartphone to support Chinese companies,\u201d said Michelle Huang, a 23-year old bank worker in Beijing who owns an iPhone and is thinking of getting a new phone.  Competition in China has also gotten tougher. Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] overtook Apple to become the world\u2019s second-biggest smartphone seller in the June quarter, data from market research firms showed, as it expanded its lead back home.  Canalys\u2019 Jia said, however, that he did not see too much of an immediate threat to Apple from the state media reports.  \u201cApple\u2019s fan base is quite stable in China and they are premium users so they not so easily swayed by the government and the news,\u201d he said.  In a quick Reuters survey of 24 smartphone users on the streets of Beijing on Wednesday, 17 had heard of the state media reports. Eleven said Apple\u2019s efforts to protect consumers were sufficient while six said they believed the company should increase its efforts to vet content.  Under pressure from China, Apple has bowed before. Last year it removed over a thousand apps from its app store on request from regulators, who called on all app store providers to purge unsanctioned news, messaging and other apps that would allow users to access foreign websites.  It also began migrating Chinese iCloud accounts to local servers under new laws that require it to hand over the reins to a partner firm that is overseen by a government work group.  The resulting Apple experience for Chinese iPhone users has become highly localized in the past year, with less crossover between apps and features in foreign markets.  The concessions have allowed Apple to keep its core services, unlike Facebook Inc FB.O and Alphabet Inc's Google GOOGL.O which have been relegated to the edges of China's consumer market following battles with regulators.

The devices will hit stores on Nov. 7. Counting new iPhones and Apple Watches released last month, Apple will have more than half a dozen new products on shelves for the holiday shopping season, many at higher prices than previous models.  The Cupertino, California, company introduced new versions of the iPad Pro, its higher-end tablet that competes with Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O Surface, with thinner bezels and more screen space, along with the face unlock system found on Apple's newer iPhones.  Prices for the iPad Pros increased to $799 and $999 for 11- and 12.9-inch models, though Apple plans to keep an older 10.5-inch version on sale for $649.  Apple unveiled the updates at an opera house at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, calling the venue a haven for creative activity. The company has been working to win back professionals like graphic designers targeted by Microsoft with its Surface tablets, which have gained market share this year.  Apple also played up software partnerships with Adobe Inc ADBE.O and Autodesk Inc ADSK.O, whose programs will now work on Apple's iPad Pro.  In July Apple reported its worst quarter of Mac sales since 2010, with unit volumes down 13 percent year over year, while iPad unit sales rose only 1 percent from a year earlier. Revenue for both fell 5 percent from the prior year.  Slideshow ( 14 images )  A new version of the Mac Book Air, originally released in 2011, will feature a higher-resolution display and thinner bezels and start at $1,199, up from $999.  \u201cYes, you save a bit compared to the Mac Book Pro, but that\u2019s not your main reason for buying it,\u201d which is instead power and portability, said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies. She said Apple \u201cknows they have a very loyal user base that will be willing to spend the money.\u201d  Apple said the Mac Mini, a small desktop customers provide their own display and accessories for, would add processing power and memory capacity and start at $799, also an increase.  As with previous models, the new machines rely on processors from Intel Corp INTC.O, but Apple said an increasing number of security features on the devices are being handled by its own so-called T2 chip.  Apple introduced new iPhones and Apple Watches last month, but the older product lines accounted for $45 billion in sales in the most recent fiscal quarter. In comparison, iPhones brought in revenue of $141.3 billion.  \u201cThey really wanted to show the world they haven\u2019t forgotten about the iPad and the Mac,\u201d said Mika Kitagawa, a senior principal research analyst at Gartner.  Slideshow ( 14 images )  Some of the recent dip in Mac sales can be explained by timing. Apple had waited until July to release new Macs, instead of June as in previous years.  And Mac sales growth has outpaced the PC market, while the iPad has been the most successful tablet in a market that turned out to be smaller than Apple hoped when it released the device in 2010.  Microsoft\u2019s Surface line offers a hybrid between a tablet and laptop that runs Microsoft\u2019s full Windows operating system. The iPad Pro runs the same operating system as iPhones.  The iPad Pro models have a USB-C port that allows them to work with an external monitor for the first time. When combined with the existing ability for an iPad Pro to work with a keyboard, the new port brings the devices closer to becoming a laptop competitor, Milanesi said.  \u201cWhen people are looking at using this as their main computing device, that\u2019s where you might seem the move toward the 12.9-inch\u201d iPad Pro, she said.  Apple shares last traded nearly flat at $212.39.","1178":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has jurisdiction for a potential probe of Apple Inc as part of a broader review of whether technology giants are using their size to act in an anti-competitive manner, two sources told Reuters.

REUTERS\/Kim Kyung-Hoon  TOKYO (Reuters) - Apple Inc will further help out Japan Display Inc by shortening payment periods, a source familiar with the matter said, as the panel supplier seeks to stabilize its finances.  CEO Minoru Kikuoka, who took the helm in September, told reporters on Wednesday that concerns about an immediate cash shortfall had been allayed but did not mention Apple by name.  The support, which also includes agreements from other business partners to ease payment conditions, would improve its short-term financing situation by as much as 40 billion yen ($370 million), he added.  The measures are separate from a deal worth at least 50 billion yen ($470 million) that Japan Display is seeking to clinch this month, having had to scramble after Chinese investment firm Harvest suddenly pulled out of a bailout plan.  Kikuoka said it was possible the revised bailout deal would not be finalised this month, but added the new agreements from clients and other partners were enough to ensure that the company would stay in business.  Japan Display, which depends on Apple for around 60% of its revenue, has lost money for the last five years and its liabilities now exceed its assets.  Of the planned bailout funds worth at least $470 million, Apple intends to invest $200 million, double the amount it originally planned, sources with direct knowledge of the talks have said.  Hong Kong-based Oasis Management is likely to contribute $150-180 million, Japan Display has said.  Japan Display still owes Apple nearly $900 million for the $1.5 billion cost of building a smartphone screen plant four years ago and the U.S. tech giant is also allowing the supplier to slow the pace of those repayments.","1181":"The logo of Apple is seen at a store in Zurich, Switzerland January 3, 2019.

Apple said it will used recycled rare earths in its \u201cTaptic Engine,\u201d a part that lets iPhones mimic a physical button click despite being a flat pane of glass. The part is about one-quarter of the rare earth elements inside the iPhone models.  Rare earths, a group of 17 specialized minerals, have become a flash point in trade tensions between the United States and China. The elements are used in weapons, consumer electronics and other goods.  China dominates the processing of the raw minerals, and has implied through its state-controlled media that it could restrict rare earths sales to the United States, just as it did to Japan after a diplomatic dispute in 2010.  Lisa Jackson, Apple\u2019s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, said Apple\u2019s use of recycled rare earths was \u201cnot related\u201d to trade tensions but could help it maintain a steady supply.  \u201cThis is one of those happy coincidences where what is good for the planet is really good for business at the same time,\u201d Jackson told Reuters. \u201cOne of the things we talk about a lot internally, just in general, is how much more resilient this makes our supply chain.\u201d  In consumer electronics, rare earths reside in tiny speakers and actuators. The parts are so small that collecting them for recycling is difficult and expensive.  For now, Apple will use recycled rare earths from an outside supplier, not from previously used iPhones. Apple declined to name the supplier or say what products the rare earths were recovered from.  But Jackson said that Apple\u2019s scale - new iPhone models are typically sell tens of millions of units per year - helped make the project economically viable.  \u201cWe have essentially made a market for this entrepreneur, this innovator, who found a way to recycle rare earths,\u201d Jackson said.  Apple often aims to reuse parts from its old devices.  Apple said on Wednesday that aluminum from enclosures recovered through its trade-in programs will be melted down and made into new MacBook Air laptop computers. The company previously disclosed that cobalt recovered from iPhone batteries disassembled by robots at its recycling labs in Texas is put into new iPhone batteries.  Apple is experimenting with ways to recover rare earths from its phones using its robots, which can remove tiny parts and separate them into collection bins to aggregate enough material to make recycling viable.  The company is also researching ways that conventional recyclers, who shred devices and separate out the various materials, could tweak their lines to recover the elements, information that Jackson said Apple is open to sharing.  \u201cThere are some innovations of ours that we actually want people to copy. So as much as possible - as long as it doesn\u2019t give away some of our other design and engineering innovation - we are happy to bring along the recycling industry,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe have started to be much more transparent around this technology development than we usually are.\u201d (Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Greg Mitchell and Sonya Hepinstall)","1183":"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Apple supplier Foxconn 2317.TW warned revenue would drop 15% in businesses including consumer electronics and enterprise products in the first quarter, but that it would recover thereafter as production returns to normal in virus-hit China.  Foxconn is among manufacturers worldwide who are grappling with virus-related curbs that have upended supply chains and hurt demand. Apple, its top client, rescinded its March quarter sales guidance citing a slower ramp up of manufacturing in China amid travel restrictions and an extended Lunar New Year break.  The Taiwanese firm, which assembles Apple's AAPL.O iPhones, said it does not expect to see any revenue growth in the first half and a \"mild downward revision\" from original guidance of \"slight growth\" for the year due to the coronavirus.  While it did not give any details, Foxconn noted the virus\u2019 impact would be short term and that so far the effect on its supply chain was \u201cnot that great\u201d.  \u201cPrevention of outbreak, resumption of work and production are our top priority,\u201d Chairman Liu Young-Way told an online investor conference on Tuesday.  Overall manufacturing activity has been hobbled in China by travel curbs and quarantine requirements aimed at containing the coronavirus which can be transmitted from person to person.  The flu-like virus, which originated in China, has spread to over 60 countries. It has infected more than 86,000 people and killed over 3,000 people, the majority in China.  Foxconn, however, sought to allay investor concerns about the virus\u2019 impact, saying it expects to resume normal production in China, its top manufacturing base, by the end of the March.  The company\u2019s \u201clong-term cooperation\u201d with suppliers will also help provide a cushion against the rise in prices of some components, Chairman Liu said.  APPLE OUTLOOK  Any disruption at Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, would cloud Apple\u2019s timeline for new phones.  Foxconn tends to handle the introduction of new iPhones as its capabilities are the most advanced, supply chain experts say, but the timeline could be threatened by travel curbs.  Apple engineers usually jet off to Asia in the first few months of the year to perfect the production of new models, former employees and supply chain experts said.  Liu said it has not seen \u201cgreat impact\u201d on clients\u2019 new product launches, pointing to its advanced assembly capacity.  Foxconn\u2019s Apple operations are housed under its consumer electronics business that accounts for more than half its revenue.

The world\u2019s top smartphone rivals have been in court over patents since 2011, when Apple filed a lawsuit alleging Samsung\u2019s smartphones and tablets \u201cslavishly\u201d copied its products. Samsung was found liable in a 2012 trial, but a disagreement over the amount to be paid led to the current retrial over damages where arguments ended on May 18.  Samsung previously paid Apple $399 million to compensate Apple for infringement of some of the patents at issue in the case. The jury has been deliberating the case since last week.  Because of that credit, if the verdict is upheld on appeal it will result in Samsung making an additional payment to Apple of nearly $140 million.  In a statement, Apple said it was pleased that the members of the jury \u201cagree that Samsung should pay for copying our products.\u201d  \u201cWe believe deeply in the value of design,\u201d Apple said in its statement. \u201cThis case has always been about more than money.\u201d  Samsung did not immediately say whether it planned to appeal the verdict but said it was retaining \u201call options\u201d to contest it.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  \u201cToday\u2019s decision flies in the face of a unanimous Supreme Court ruling in favor of Samsung on the scope of design patent damages,\u201d Samsung said in a statement. \u201cWe will consider all options to obtain an outcome that does not hinder creativity and fair competition for all companies and consumers.\u201d  The new jury verdict followed a trial in San Jose, California, before Judge Lucy Koh that focused on how much Samsung should pay for infringing Apple patents covering aspects of the iPhone\u2019s design. The jury awarded Apple $533.3 million for Samsung\u2019s violation of so-called design patents and $5.3 million for the violation of so-called utility patents.  Apple this year told jurors it was entitled to $1 billion in profits Samsung made from selling infringing phones, saying the iPhone\u2019s design was crucial to their success.  Samsung sought to limit damages to about $28 million, saying it should only pay for profits attributable to the components of its phones that infringed Apple patents.  Jurors in the earlier trial awarded $1.05 billion to Apple, which was later reduced.  Samsung paid $548 million to Apple in December 2015, including $399 million for infringement of some of the patents at issue in this week\u2019s trial.  Apple\u2019s case against Samsung raised the question of whether the total profits from a product that infringes a design patent should be awarded if the patent applies only to a component of the product, said Sarah Burstein, a professor of patent law at the University of Oklahoma.  The verdict appears to be a compromise between Apple and Samsung\u2019s positions and does not offer much clarity on that question, said Burstein, who predicted Samsung would appeal it to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  \u201cThis decision just means we are going to have more uncertainty,\u201d Burstein said. \u201cSmart tech industry players are waiting to see what the Federal Circuit does. This is just one jury applying one test.\u201d","1186":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq hit all-time closing highs on Tuesday, but a drop in Apple stock capped gains from positive developments in U.S.-China trade and fresh progress in the medical battle against the coronavirus pandemic.

Technology stocks led a sell-off across Asian, European and U.S. shares after Apple cut its revenue forecast, its first downgrade in nearly 12 years, blaming weaker iPhone sales in China.  The news also jolted currency markets and German government bond yields held close to their lowest in over two years.  \u201cFor the moment, investors have reacted by going into non-risky assets,\u201d said Philippe Waechter, chief economist at Ostrum Asset Management, in Paris.  \u201cNo one wants to take any risk because none of the uncertainties we are facing have been lifted, whether it\u2019s Brexit, this trade war, or growth. Investors are putting their heads in the sand and waiting.\u201d  Apple\u2019s U.S. and Frankfurt-listed shares tumbled almost 10 percent.  The alert renewed worries about corporate earnings just weeks before results season kicks off in the United States and stirred worries that it signals broader malaise in the global economy, said Peter Rutter, head of global equities at Royal London Asset Management.  \u201cThe equity market in the past three or four months has begun to bake in some form of economic slowdown and a reduction in corporate earnings expectations and there\u2019s a wrestling match between waiting for that to come through,\u201d he said.  Analysts on average expect S&P 500 companies to increase their earnings per share by nearly 7 percent this year, down from a forecast of 10 percent at the start of October and far below their expectations of 24 percent EPS growth for 2018, according to Refinitiv\u2019s IBES.  The news sparked a \u2018flash crash\u2019 in holiday-thinned currency markets as growing concerns about the health of the global economy, particularly in China, sent investors scurrying into the safe-haven of the Japanese yen, which was poised for its biggest daily rise in 20 months.  Apple\u2019s warning came after data earlier this week showed a deceleration in factory activity in China and the euro zone, indicating the trade dispute between the United States and China was taking a toll on global manufacturing.  U.S. stocks opened lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.73 percent and the Nasdaq Composite dropping 1.22 percent.  In Europe, the pan European STOXX 600 was down 0.2 percent in late afternoon trade, with major European bourses off earlier lows as better-than-expected U.S. jobs data helping soothe some concerns.  \u201cYou get Apple data today and then you get this (solid) jobs data. I think we\u2019ll be waiting for the evidence of some slowdown to justify some of this recent sell-off and rotation between sectors,\u201d said Rutter.  Chipmakers who supply parts to Apple were the worst hit, sending technology stocks to their lowest since February 2017.  Overnight, shares in China and Hong Kong see-sawed between gains and losses as investors braced for Beijing to roll out fresh support measures for the cooling Chinese economy.  \u2018FLASH CRASH\u2019  Currency markets saw a wild spike in volatility in early Asian trade, with the yen moving sharply higher against the U.S. dollar, breaking key technical levels and triggering stop-loss sales of U.S. and Australian dollars.  The dollar was last 1 percent weaker against the yen at 107.77, having earlier fallen as low as 104.96, its lowest level since March 2018. The Australian dollar at one point hit levels against the Japanese yen not seen since 2011.  The euro was up 0.3 percent, buying $1.1375, and the dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of major rivals, was 0.3 percent weaker at 96.52.

After the bell, the Cupertino, California company cut its sales forecast for its quarter ending in December, citing slowing iPhone sales in China.  That sent its stock down 7.5 percent after hours and knocked 1.3 percent off S&P 500 futures, suggesting the market was set to open weaker on Thursday as already skittish investors reconsider their earnings expectations for U.S. multinationals.  \u201cPeople are looking for a January rally effect as they place bets for the new year. Apple puts a bit of a sour tone on that,\u201d said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager of Synovus Trust Co. \u201cIt raises concerns about whether current estimates for the quarter are too high.\u201d  Including its after-hours drop on Wednesday, Apple's stock market value has tumbled to below $700 billion from over $1.1 trillion at its peak in October. Although it has fallen behind Amazon AMZN.O and Microsoft MSFT.O in value, Apple remains one of Wall Street's most widely-held companies, and its warning will affect sentiment across the stock market.  Following the S&P 500's worst December performance since the Great Depression, many investors this week returned from holidays optimistic that a correction that started last September may have run its course. The S&P 500 .SPX on Wednesday was up nearly 7 percent over five sessions from its recent low on Dec. 24.  Apple's revised fiscal first-quarter revenue estimate of $84 billion was nearly 12 percent short of the average analyst estimate, even after recent warnings about slow demand from iPhone component suppliers Skyworks Solutions SWKS.O and Qorvo QRVO.O.  With the S&P 500 recently trading at 14 times expected earnings, down from 18 times a year ago, a key argument for Wall Street bulls is that the stock market has become undervalued after its recent sell-off. But if Apple\u2019s warning is followed by many more, the S&P 500 may appear less of a bargain at current levels.  Analysts on average expect S&P 500 companies to increase their earnings per share by nearly 7 percent this year, far below their expectations of 24 percent EPS growth for 2018, according to the most recent estimate from Refinitiv\u2019s IBES. At the start of October, analysts had been forecasting 10 percent EPS growth for 2019.  Tech sector profit growth, a whopping 29 percent in the third quarter, is expected to slow to 12 percent for the fourth quarter and to dwindle to just 2 percent in the first quarter of 2019, according to the most recent IBES data.","1198":"Jan 28 (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday reported sales and profits for the holiday shopping quarter above Wall Street expectations, powered by a rise in iPhone sales for the first time in a year and soaring demand for add-ons like AirPods wireless headphones.  But even though Apple executives set a new target of 600 million paid subscribers on its platform by the end of calendar 2020, the company\u2019s closely watched services business, which includes its new Apple TV+ streaming offering, missed Wall Street\u2019s targets. Apple\u2019s total number of installed devices grew by 100 million to more than 1.5 billion over the past year.  Apple gave a revenue forecast for the quarter ending in March above Wall Street expectations. But Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters the company was using a wider-than-normal prediction range because of the uncertainty created by the coronavirus outbreak in China, where many of Apple\u2019s suppliers are based. Cook said executives plan to discuss more details of how the virus will affect Apple\u2019s supply chain on the company\u2019s conference call with investors.  Apple posted $91.8 billion in revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 28, compared with analyst estimates of $88.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company forecast $63.0 billion to $67.0 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in March, ahead of estimates of $62.4 billion, showing it believes that its phones and other devices such as AirPods wireless headphones will continue to sell well during what is often a slow time of year.  Apple\u2019s share price has more than doubled since Cook warned a year ago that the company was likely to miss financial targets for its biggest sales quarter of its fiscal 2019. In the year since, Apple slashed prices in China, one of its most important markets, to rekindle sales there. The company also made a push into paid services, rolling out a credit card with Goldman Sachs and subscription gaming and television services last year.  Apple reported services revenue of $12.7 billion, below analyst estimates of $13 billion, and up from $10.9 billion the year before. Many investors think that services revenue eventually will boost Apple\u2019s gross margins, which were 38.35% in the December quarter compared with estimates of 38.06%.  The shift toward services, however, depends on Apple continuing to grow its base of users and sign them up for recurring subscriptions that analysts view as potentially more lucrative than hardware sales, which can be inconsistent because they are large purchases that consumers make only every few years. Apple said it now has more than 1.5 billion active installed devices and 480 million subscribers to both its own and third-party paid services, compared with 1.4 billion devices and 360 million subscribers a year earlier.  Apple\u2019s Cook told Reuters the company expects surpass its previously stated goal of 500 million subscribers for 2020 during the current quarter ended in March, ahead of schedule. Cook said Apple is establishing a new goal of 600 million subscribers by the end of the calendar year.  \u201cWe\u2019re really proud of 100 million (user) growth in the installed base. That\u2019s huge. And that\u2019s a testament to the new customers we brought in, the switchers,\u201d Cook told Reuters.  Cook said the company\u2019s Apple TV+ subscription streaming video service released last fall was a \u201crousing success\u201d and that it is \u201cvery strong, both the people that are getting it in the bundle and the people that are paying for it that haven\u2019t bought a new device.\u201d  Solid iPhone sales of $55.96 billion compared with analyst estimates of $51.6 billion and year-before sales of $52 billion snapped a yearlong trend of major sales declines for Apple\u2019s biggest-selling hardware product. Cook said that the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models drove the growth and also factored into the company\u2019s forecast, calling the devices \u201cthe strongest iPhone lineup we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d  But Apple\u2019s wearables segment \u2013 which, along with AirPods, also includes the Apple Watch \u2013 hit $10.0 billion in revenue versus estimates of $9.5 billion, up sharply from $7.3 billion the year before. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a note to clients that sales of AirPods alone \u2013 a metric Apple does not disclose \u2013 may have reached $3.5 billion to $4 billion in the December quarter, a rise of 150% from the year before.  Cook told Reuters that Apple could not make enough AirPods and Apple Watch Series 3 devices to meet demand during the fiscal first quarter and continues to be short on both. Cook said Apple does not have an estimate for when it will be able to fulfill demand for each.  \u201cWe\u2019re working on both of those very hard,\u201d Cook told Reuters.  For the December quarter, Apple reported earnings per share of $4.99, compared with analyst estimates of $4.55 per share. For the quarter ending in March, Apple forecast gross margins of between 38.0% and 39.0%, compared with analyst estimates of 38.2%.","1199":"U.S. flags are seen near a TikTok logo in this illustration picture taken July 16, 2020.

U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington issued a preliminary injunction on Sept. 27 that barred the U.S. Commerce Department from ordering Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google app stores to remove TikTok for download by new users.  Nichols must now decide whether to block the other aspects of the Commerce Department order set to take effect on Nov. 12. Nichols\u2019 new hearing is scheduled for one day after the presidential election.  Talks are ongoing to finalize a preliminary deal for Walmart Inc and Oracle Corp to take stakes in a new company, TikTok Global, that would oversee U.S. operations. U.S. President Donald Trump said last month the deal had his \u201cblessing.\u201d  Key terms of the deal, including who will have majority ownership, are in dispute. TikTok owner ByteDance has also said any deal will need China\u2019s approval, and Beijing has revised its list of technologies subject to export bans, in a way that gives it a say over any TikTok deal.  The Trump administration contends TikTok poses national security concerns as personal data collected on 100 million Americans who use the app could be obtained by China\u2019s government.  Any deal is subject to review by the U.S. government\u2019s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). That panel could also decide to block the app\u2019s use in the United States.  Separately the Justice Department appealed the Sept. 19 preliminary junction issued by U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The injunction blocked the U.S. Commerce Department order, which would also bar other U.S. transactions with Tencent Holding\u2019s WeChat, potentially making the app unusable in the United States.  A schedule released by the court suggested no ruling on request is likely until late November at the earliest.","1200":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc on Wednesday warned that privacy changes coming from Apple Inc could hurt smaller developers such as gaming companies disproportionately but will likely leave its own apps mostly unscathed.  FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen placed on a keyboard in this illustration taken March 25, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  In a blog post, Facebook said it was making a change to its own apps - which in addition to its flagship app also include WhatsApp and Instagram - that would likely spare them from having to ask iPhone users for data-tracking permissions that many advertising industry insiders believe users will refuse.  Facebook shares surged 8.2% on Wednesday to close at $303.91, a record high for a second straight day.  In a blog post, Facebook said it was also making changes that could hurt smaller developers that use a Facebook tool for serving apps in third-party apps. The changes come ahead of Apple\u2019s new rules, which require increased user notifications for ad tracking and will take effect when new iPhones arrive this fall.  Facebook said it was considering discontinuing on iPhones a tool called Audience Network, which thousands of developers put into their apps to serve ads. Facebook collects data about users from the apps where it serves those ads, which it uses to inform highly tailored targeting throughout its business.  \"Apple's updates may render Audience Network so ineffective on iOS 14 that it may not make sense to offer it on iOS 14,\" Facebook said in a blog post bit.ly\/3lh5zcp. (bit.ly\/3lh5zcp)  The Audience Network business, while an important source of revenue and traffic to small developers such as gaming companies, is far from Facebook\u2019s biggest business, said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at GroupM. \u201cIt would surprise me if it was greater than $1 billion on a net basis,\u201d he said.  Apple previously provided a tool called the identifier for advertisers, or IDFA, that allowed Facebook and others to engage in such tracking of users across apps.  But in June, the iPhone maker said such activity will require a pop-up notification saying the app \u201cwould like permission to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.\u201d Digital advertising firms expect most users will decline to grant that permission.  \u201cApple is saying, we had an \u2018opt out\u2019 system before, and we\u2019re going to switch to an \u2018opt in\u2019 system,\u201d said Craig Danuloff, chief executive of The Privacy Co, which makes an app to help users assess how private their data is.  \u201cWhat do advertisers say? They immediately assume it\u2019s Armageddon. They just know nobody really wants this.\u201d  As an alternative to the tracking tools it previously provided advertisers, Apple created a new advertising network technology that was better for privacy protection of users.  Facebook on Wednesday said it would stop using Apple\u2019s older tracking tools in its own apps and adopt Apple\u2019s new offering, though it said Apple\u2019s new technology \u201climits the data available to businesses for running and measuring campaigns.\u201d  The changes Facebook announced Wednesday will fall hardest on ads that prompt users to install new mobile apps, a format that is heavily used in the video game industry.  \u201cApple\u2019s iOS 14 changes will certainly negatively affect the way that game studios and publishers currently raise revenue and gain users through sales targeted advertisements,\u201d Renee Gittins, executive director of the International Game Developers Association, said in a statement.  John Nardone, chief executive of ad serving software company Flashtalking, said Apple\u2019s move to restrict its ad business could be viewed as anti-competitive by raising prices for consumers used to free, ad-supported apps.  \u201cThere\u2019s self-interest in Apple doing this because as the advertising revenue stream becomes more difficult, then apps have to charge users and Apple, as you know from the Epic Games case, takes 30% of that,\u201d Nardone said. \u201cApple doesn\u2019t have a stake in ads but they have a stake in paid apps.\u201d  For publishers the burden may be less, said David Chavern, president of the News Media Alliance, which represents several major U.S. publishers.  Many rely on what is known as first-party data, such as which stories a user reads, to determine which ads to show, an activity which is not subject to Apple\u2019s new rules.  \u201cNews publishers aren\u2019t huge beneficiaries of cross-app tracking and, more broadly, we all see the ecosystem moving against highly targeted programmatic ads,\u201d he said. \u201cThere may end up being benefits to publishers from that, such as a some move back to contextual advertising.\u201d","1201":"FILE PHOTO: An Apple logo hangs above the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in the Manhattan borough of New York City, July 21, 2015.

On a comparable basis, the Apple Music service has 48 million subscribers, 40 million of whom are paying subscribers and 8 million of whom are on a free trial, Apple said.

He previously built up Apple\u2019s services businesses outside the U.S. in 155 markets, including China, Japan and Latin America, Apple said.  Apple\u2019s services business, which includes Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud, is becoming increasingly important to the Apple\u2019s financial outlook because the smart phone market has matured and iPhone sales growth has slowed.

Launched in October 2014, Apple\u2019s mobile payment service Apple Pay is part of the company\u2019s diversification from device sales. It is available in more than 50 countries worldwide, including in more than 20 EU countries.  The questionnaire asked if companies were under a contractual obligation to enable a certain payment method and also if such contracts included conditions for integrating Apple Pay in their apps and websites.  Regulators wanted to know if Apple has rejected merchant apps as incompatible with the terms and conditions for integrating Apple Pay in their apps.  The Commission confirmed that it had sought information from market participants.  \u201cThe Commission is actively monitoring the development of mobile payment solutions, the behaviour by operators active in the payments sector, including mobile payments,\u201d the EU competition enforcer said.  Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.  Critics have long complained about an NFC chip embedded in the Apple iPhone which means Apple Pay is automatically selected when an iPhone user pays for goods and services, barring rival payment methods.

FILE PHOTO: Japan Display Inc's logo is pictured at its headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, August 9, 2016. REUTERS\/Kim Kyung-Hoon\/File Photo  The liquid crystal display (LCD) maker for smartphones, which gets more than half of its revenue from Apple, posted a net loss of 83.27 billion yen ($786.53 million) in the April-June quarter, far wider than the 1.77 billion loss a year earlier.  The ballooning loss, including a 51.4 billion yen writedown on an LCD plant, made its net worth negative, with liabilities exceeding assets. Two consecutive years of negative net worth would mean the company would be delisted, according to rules of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Japan Display is tapping a consortium led by Chinese investment firm Harvest Group for an 80 billion yen bailout deal, which includes investments from Apple and Hong Kong-based activist investor Oasis Management.  \u201cWe are aiming to resolve the negative net worth by making best use of the planned cash injection,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Minoru Kikuoka told an earnings briefing on Friday.  The Japanese company plans to hold a shareholders\u2019 meeting on Sept. 27 to formalize the bailout plan.  The investment, to be completed by August next year at the latest, will give the Chinese group a 49.8% stake in Japan Display, replacing Japanese government-backed fund INCJ as the biggest shareholder.  But it remains unclear whether Japan Display can close the deal by the deadline, as the investment is dependent on certain conditions, such as no intervention by Chinese authorities and no major cuts in orders from Apple.  Analysts say Apple may be ditching LCD screens in favor of thinner, more flexible OLED (organic light-emitting diode) displays as early as next year, an additional blow to the Japanese company whose late shift to OLED screens has already cost it orders from its biggest customer.  Japan Display first agreed on the bailout deal with the Chinese group in April, but was forced to change the structure as some members of the group walked away after making checks on Japan Display\u2019s financials.

The iPhone XS, pronounced \u201cten S,\u201d and XS Max were launched on Sept. 12. The XS has a 5.8-inch screen, and starts at $999 while the XS Max, the largest iPhone to date has a 6.5-inch screen, with a base price of $1,099.  The phones, however, do possess an advanced chip, which makes the facial recognition feature even smoother. They also have a new image sensor and processor, incremental changes to the X that allow for better photography.  A bright spot in an otherwise low-key upgrade is the dual SIM support, a feature that the company\u2019s much-touted iPhone X did not have. Apple has also included eSIMs, a technology currently in Apple watches and cellular iPads.  \u201cThe iPhone XS and XS Max follow in the footsteps of S-year iPhones -- they\u2019re faster, with better camera hardware ... but except for dual SIM support, there isn\u2019t a brand-new feature like Touch ID or 3D Touch this time,\u201d CNET\u2019s Scott Stein said.

The complaint, led by the Employees\u2019 Retirement System of the State of Rhode Island, came after Cook on Jan. 2, 2019 unexpectedly reduced Apple\u2019s quarterly revenue forecast by up to $9 billion, in part because of U.S.-China trade tensions.

The California-based tech giant blamed fewer iPhone upgrades and slowing sales in China in warning about revenues in its most recent quarter, its first such warning since 2007. Its shares tumbled 8 percent in after-hours trade.  The news sparked a \u2018flash crash\u2019 in holiday-thinned currency markets as investors rushed to less risky assets, with the Japanese yen soaring against most major currencies in a matter of seconds.  U.S. stock futures pointed to another rough start on Wall Street, with Nasdaq E-mini futures down 2.2 percent and S&P 500 E-mini futures off 1.3 percent.  MSCI\u2019s broadest gauge of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.4 percent after an early attempt at a bounce. Japanese markets were closed for holidays but Nikkei futures dropped 1.9 percent.

China\u2019s central bank said late on Wednesday it was adjusting policy to benefit more small firms that are having trouble obtaining financing, in its latest move to ease strains on the private sector, a key job creator.  While more fiscal and monetary policy support had been expected in coming months on top of modest measures last year, some analysts wonder if more forceful stimulus will be needed to stabilise the world\u2019s second-largest economy.  \u201cDespite a more pro-growth policy stance, effectively since mid-2018, we expect growth to continue to slow in the foreseeable future as it appears to us that the government\u2019s policy is still behind the curve,\u201d economists at BofA Merrill Lynch said in a global research repport.  \u201cIn our view, the next significant stimulus may only occur when the government senses that financial stability is in jeopardy.\u201d  Apple\u2019s surprise announcement weighed on tech shares across Asia, most notably in Taiwan and South Korea. Korean shares were 1.3 percent lower and shares in Taiwan lost 1.4 percent.  Australia bucked the trend, with the ASX 200 bouncing 1.6 percent after the previous day\u2019s drubbing. A sudden slide in the Aussie dollar, which fell to near decade lows at one point, boosted shares of miners and other resource exporters despite the weakening China demand outlook.  The volatile day for Asian markets followed swings on Wall Street overnight, where shares slid in early trade on growth worries before clawing back losses, as surging oil prices drove gains in energy shares.  Apple specifically highlighted slowing Chinese growth and Sino-U.S. trade tensions, exacerbating investors\u2019 concerns about the health of the global economy.  \u201cThe fall in the EM manufacturing PMI last month was fairly broad-based and supports our view that growth in the emerging world as a whole will slow this year,\u201d Gabriella Dickens, an economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.  Adding to the sour mood, a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and congressional leaders produced no agreement to end a partial government shutdown.  Trump\u2019s demand for $5 billion in funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border triggered the shutdown affecting about a quarter of the federal government and 800,000 federal workers.  \u2018FLASH CRASH\u2019  Currency markets saw a wild spike in volatility in early Asian trade, with risk aversion pushing the yen sharply higher against the U.S. dollar, breaking key technical levels and triggering stop-loss sales of U.S. and Australian dollars.  The dollar was last 1.6 percent weaker against the yen at 107.15, while the Australian dollar at one point hit levels against the Japanese yen not seen since 2011.  The euro was up 0.2 percent, buying $1.1365, and the dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of major rivals, was 0.3 percent weaker at 96.503.  Amid the flight to perceived safety, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell to 2.6328 percent compared with its U.S. close of 2.661 percent on Wednesday.  The two-year yield, was at 2.4777 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.504 percent as signs of slowing growth ate away at expectations of further Federal Reserve rate hikes.  U.S. crude fell 1.8 percent to $45.71 a barrel after a sharp rise on Wednesday. Brent crude was down 1 percent at $54.38.

Apple also introduced a new Apple Watch Series 6 that monitors blood oxygen and will cost $399 and a more basic Apple Watch SE for $279.  But the bevy of incremental updates to existing hardware and subscription price tinkering disappointed investors, with Apple shares closing up 0.2%.  The Apple One bundle will cost $15 per month for an individual plan or $20 per month for a family plan and include television, music and games. Apple is also offering a bundle for $30 per month that adds news, the fitness service and more storage.  \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more aggressive pricing than I thought,\u201d said Ben Bajarin, principal analyst for consumer market intelligence at research firm Creative Strategies, adding that Apple customers already paying $15 a month for family plans to some of the company\u2019s content servers would likely find the largest bundle a \u201cno-brainer.\u201d  Apple's top streaming music rival Spotify Technology SPOT.N criticized the bundle, saying Apple was abusing its dominant market position to favor Apple Music. Spotify, which is pursuing an antitrust case against Apple in the European Union and has spoken with U.S. authorities probing the iPhone maker, charges $10 a month for its streaming service that competes with Apple but will not be eligible for Apple's bundle.  In a statement responding to Spotify\u2019s criticism, Apple said the bundle was aimed at existing users of its services and that \u201ccustomers can discover and enjoy alternatives to every one of Apple\u2019s services.\u201d  Slideshow ( 6 images )  Apple said both new watches and a new eighth-generation iPad can be pre-ordered starting Tuesday and will be available on Friday. Apple also introduced the Apple Fitness+ service, powered by its watches, that will deliver virtual workouts for $10 per month or $80 per year and be available before the end of the year.  Apple's fitness service puts it closer to competition with Peloton Interactive Inc PTON.O, which makes connected exercise gear and sells subscriptions to online fitness classes. Apple said that most of its workouts were designed to be conducted with either no equipment or minimal gear such as a set of dumbbells. Peloton's workouts typically require either a bike or a treadmill. Shares of Peloton closed up 4%.  The ability of the Apple Watch to monitor blood oxygen seeks to beat a similar feature already available on watches from rival Fitbit Inc FIT.N, which Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google is buying for $2.1 billion. Apple said its watch will be able to take absolute blood oxygen measurements on-demand while the user is still, while Fitbit's devices currently show either variations in blood oxygen levels or a set of measurements taken while the user is sleeping.  Apple also for the first time offered a way to use an Apple Watch without pairing it one-to-one with an iPhone, offering what it calls \u201cFamily Setup.\u201d  FASTER IPAD CHIP  Apple added a faster chip to its base model iPad, which it priced at $329 for consumers and $299 for education customers. Apple\u2019s new iPad Air will cost $599 and look more like its iPad Pro models and a new A14 processor chip that Apple says will be the first to use a 5-nanometer chip manufacturing process.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  An update of Apple\u2019s biggest seller - the iPhone - is expected to be announced next month after executives have said its launch will be delayed by several weeks because of pandemic-related disruptions.  Apple said flu investigators in Washington state will study heart rate and blood oxygen data from Apple Watch for potential early signs of respiratory conditions like influenza and COVID-19.  Doctors in India and other countries have used pulse oximeters to remotely check on COVID-19 patients and ensure their oxygen saturation level does not fall too low.  Apple shares have soared this year even as the virus has crippled economies around the world, thanks in large part to booming sales of work-from-home items.  Apple shares gave up gains to trade flat on Tuesday after climbing more than 50% for the year, well ahead of the 23% gain for the Nasdaq. Even though Apple stock has fallen from a record high earlier this month, it remains near a $2-trillion stock market valuation.","1215":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's limited trade deal with China removes a major hurdle for Apple AAPL.O and other technology stocks that have already surged this year to record highs.  The so-called Phase One deal announced, but still not signed, on Friday suspends the planned imposition of new 15% tariffs on Sunday that would have hit $160 billion in Chinese consumer goods just weeks before Christmas, including $115 billion worth of iPhones, laptops and other electronics.  The deal would also see the United States reduce existing tariffs on other goods. China has agreed to boost imports of U.S. energy, pharmaceutical and agricultural products, although Chinese officials offered no details on the amount of U.S. goods Beijing had agreed to buy.  If it is signed, Trump\u2019s long-awaited deal will be a relief to Apple, among the U.S. companies with the most to lose in the trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies, along with chipmakers who make the components in its devices, which are mostly made in China.  \u201cThe Street has been laser focused on this additional 15% next round of tariffs and we believe this ultimately signals a green light for tech stocks heading into year end with the impending $160 billion tariff no longer a near-term concern,\u201d Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note on Friday.  Ives estimated that the tariffs that would have hit iPhone imports on Sunday would have clipped about 4%, or 50 cents, off of Apple\u2019s 2020 earnings per share.  Even amid trade uncertainty, Apple surged over 70% this year to all-time highs on broad investor confidence in recent months that Washington and Beijing would eventually strike a deal. Apple\u2019s stock has also benefited from progress increasing its services revenue as it diversifies from declining iPhone sales.

Still, Investors are divided over whether Trump's trade deal is fully priced into the market, or whether shares of Apple, its suppliers, like Qorvo QRVO.O and Skyworks Solutions SWKS.O, and other U.S. technology and trade-sensitive stocks have room to rise.  The S&P 500 edged up 0.01% on Friday to close at its second record high in two days, while Apple rose 1.36% to an all-time high.

The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index .SOX has surged 56% in 2019, as the rollout of 5G wireless technology appeared likely to end a downturn in global chip demand and on confidence the trade war would be resolved. The global chip market is set to recover by 5.9% in 2020 after shrinking 12.8% this year, according to a forecast by World Semiconductor Trade Statistics.  But gains in technology stocks have stretched their earnings multiples, increasing the risk should their bottom lines not grow next year as much as expected, or should Trump\u2019s trade deal sour. The S&P 500 information technology sector is trading at over 20 times expected earnings, its highest multiple since 2005, according to Refinitiv.  Earnings for the tech sector are expected to grow by about 10% next year after falling 1% in 2019, according to Refinitiv\u2019s I\/B\/E\/S data. That is mostly in line with broader expectations for the S&P 500, with analysts predicting around 10% profit growth next year, up from 1% in 2019.  \u201cMarkets are clearly seeing through this year\u2019s flat S&P earnings and expect much better results in 2020,\u201d Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek, wrote in a note.  (Graphic: U.S.-China trade timeline (with Apple share price) Image )","1216":"Oct 29 (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Thursday reported revenue and profits that beat Wall Street expectations, with a continued boom in sales of Macs and accessories such as AirPods helping offset a decline in iPhone sales as customers waited for new models.  Despite delays with its best-selling iPhones, the Cupertino, California-based company has consistently beaten sales expectations this year and released a slew of new products and services that its customers have embraced while largely homebound during the pandemic.  Apple said revenue and profits for the fiscal fourth quarter ended on Sept. 26 was $64.7 billion and 73 cents per share, compared with analyst estimates of $63.7 billion and 70 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Sales of iPhones declined 20.7% to $26.4 billion, a sharper fall than the analyst expectations of a 16.2% drop, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Apple did not announce the iPhone 12 until Oct. 13, several weeks later than usual, meaning no opening-weekend iPhone sales are included in the fourth-quarter results.  Analysts anticipated consumers would hold off on iPhone purchases ahead of new iPhone 12 models. Those devices feature 5G networking connectivity and are expected to be strong sellers as mobile carriers jump back into subsidizing device purchases to lure consumers into new 5G data plans.  In an interview with Reuters, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about the iPhone 12 cycle based on the first five days of shipping data.  \u201c5G is a once-in-a-decade kind of opportunity. And we could not be more excited to hit the market exactly when we did,\u201d Cook said. \u201cAt least in the U.S., the carriers are being very aggressive.\u201d  The iPhone 12 release timing drove down sales in Greater China to $7.95 billion from $11.13 billion the year before. Cook said all of Apple\u2019s non-iPhone products grew in China and Apple expects sales to pick up there again.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in the early going in the first five days gives us a lot of confidence that China will return to growth in our fiscal Q1,\u201d Cook told Reuters.  Apple has offset volatile iPhone sales in recent years with steady growth in its services segment, which includes streaming music and television. Services revenue rose 16.3% to $14.5 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $14 billion. Cook told Reuters that Apple One, a bundle of Apple\u2019s paid services, will launch on Friday.  Cook told Reuters that Apple has 585 million paying subscribers across its platforms, up from 550 million the previous quarter and closer to the goal of 600 million subscribers that the company set out for the end of calendar 2020.  Apple did, however, announce a range of new Apple Watches and iPads that went on sale during the quarter. The pandemic-driven shift toward working, learning and consuming entertainment from home helped Apple post double-digit revenue increases in every non-iPhone product category as well as its services business, which includes its streaming television offering and forthcoming paid fitness service. It was the second straight quarter of growth across the non-iPhone hardware categories, some of which had experienced declines until a pandemic sales boom. Apple faces an uncertain fiscal first quarter with new lockdown orders issued in major European markets such as France and Germany on Wednesday. While the company has so far managed to keep sales booming with its retail stores in a state of flux, analysts have raised concerns that the lockdowns or their economic fallout could mute holiday iPhone sales.  Apple\u2019s Cook said the company gets a \u201ctailwind\u201d boost from having four new phone models at different price points - the most it has ever released in one fall season - that appeal to a variety of customers, and a \u201cheadwind\u201d from having fewer weeks in the quarter to sell them.  \u201cCOVID I would classify as kind of an unknown,\u201d Cook said.  Apple said revenue from its accessories segment was up 20.8% to $7.9 billion, compared with analyst estimates of a 13.5% rise to $7.4 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Mac and iPad sales rose to $9.0 billion and $6.8 billion, compared with estimates of $7.92 billion and $6.12 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  \u201cMac had its best quarter ever in the history of the company,\u201d Cook said.  The company also said it had returned nearly $22 billion to shareholders in the quarter as it kept its target of reaching a new cash neutral position.","1217":"April 30 (Reuters) - Apple Inc reported sales and profits that beat Wall Street expectations Thursday, with Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook saying China sales were \u201cheaded in the right direction\u201d as that country reopens from the novel coronavirus.  But Cook said it was impossible to forecast overall results for the current quarter because of uncertainty created by the virus.  With its global brand, few American companies have been exposed to the spread of the coronavirus like Apple, whose iPhone sales declined in the March quarter as device sales were forced to online-only in many places. Sales of services such as streaming television content rose with billions of people locked in their homes. China, where the virus was first detected, is both a major market for Apple, supplying about a sixth of its overall sales, and is also home to most of Apple\u2019s contract factories.  Apple saw China sales of $9.46 billion, down less than a $1 billion from a year ago, a potential sign of how the company will fare as other markets emerge from lockdowns.  \u201cWhen the lockdown went into effect at the end of January, we saw a very steep falloff in demand for the month of February,\u201d Cook told Reuters. Apple slowly reopened Chinese stores, with all running again by mid-March. \u201cAs compared to February, we saw a nice improvement in March and a further improvement in April. China is headed in the right direction.\u201d  Apple reported sales of $58.3 billion and earnings of $2.55 per share for its fiscal second quarter ended in March, above year-ago results of $58 billion and $2.46, and above analyst estimates of $54.5 billion and $2.27, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Cook said that during the first five weeks of the fiscal second quarter, \u201cit was an incredible time where we were growing very fast and we were set to essentially come in at the high end of our guidance\u201d of between $63 billion and $67 billion in sales. The quarter quickly changed when the virus spread in China, hitting Apple\u2019s supply chain and sales there, and then hit the rest of the world as Apple\u2019s stores and contract factories came back online. Apple broke with its usual practice of providing an estimated range of sales for the current quarter.  \u201cThe question is: When do stores reopen, when do the shelter-in-places come off, when is it comfortable to go back to working in stores and having consumers come out?\u201d Cook said. \u201cRather than pretend we can project it, we\u2019re being very straightforward and saying we lack the visibility to do it.\u201d  In February, Apple warned investors that it was unlikely to meet its financial guidance for the March quarter and could face iPhone shortages as lockdown orders in China kept factories closed and forced Apple to shutter its stores there.  Apple reopened its stores in China in mid-March and factories resumed production - but by that time, the pandemic had spread to Europe and the rest of the world, which have left Apple stores outside mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea shuttered.  The closures, along with lockdown orders in many major Apple markets such as the United States and Europe, have forced Apple and its biggest sales partners in the retail and mobile carrier industries to conduct most sales online or via curbside pickup, including of the newly launched iPhone SE 2.  Cook declined to comment on whether Apple faces supply chain disruptions for devices that will be released later this year, saying the company does not comment on future products. He said Apple\u2019s supply chain was \u201cback up and running at full-throttle at the end of March.\u201d  Cook said that he was pleased with early sales of the new device, along with new Macs and iPads released during the fiscal second quarter, but that Apple would be subject to broader market forces in the coming months.  \u201cWe\u2019re clearly not immune to the macreconomic environment - I\u2019m not sure hardly anybody is immune at this point,\u201d Cook told Reuters. \u201cWe\u2019re primarily focused on doing what we can to help the situation that the world is in, and we\u2019ll let the economy take care of itself. As compared to the last part of March and the beginning of April, we\u2019ve seen a better second half of April.\u201d  Apple said iPhone sales were $29.0 billion, down from $30.9 billion the year before compared with analyst estimates of $28.4 billion, to data from FactSet.  Sales for Apple\u2019s services segment, which includes iCloud storage as well as its streaming services for music and television shows, were $13.4 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $12.9 billion, according to FactSet data. Cook said Apple had 515 million subscribers to apps and services on Apple\u2019s platform, up by 125 million from one year earlier.  Apple\u2019s wearables and accessories segment, which includes Apple\u2019s AirPods and Apple Watch, were $6.3 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $6.7 billion, according to FactSet data.","1218":"CHICAGO\/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday rolled out a new iPad and classroom software aimed at grabbing more of the U.S. education market, but did not cut the price of its entry-level tablet despite schools flocking to laptops costing a third less.  Apple is looking to reassert dominance in U.S. schools, where inexpensive laptops running software from Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Microsoft Corp now top iPad by sales, offering a cheap way to get to cloud-based productivity tools.  The new iPad has a more powerful computing chip and an extensive set of new, free software for teachers to manage students and schoolwork. But the unchanged starting price of $299 for students and $329 for the general public, without a keyboard or case, compares with less than $200 for some Windows and Google Chrome models.

Some analysts had believed Apple might cut prices, but the company stuck with its more traditional approach of packing more features into a device.  Despite the new software, Apple faces a tough battle in the educational market given the popularity of Google and Microsoft\u2019s productivity suites, said Carolina Milanesi of Creative Strategies. Google\u2019s G Suite fueled Chromebook sales because it was seen as easy to use to manage assignments.  \u201cMost teachers don\u2019t look past G Suite for education,\u201d she said.  Apple, as part of its response, on Tuesday announced improvements in its iWork suite at an event in Chicago, where school bells and announcements over a public address system directed press and more than 300 teachers into an auditorium at Lane Tech College Prep High School.  The event came during a spring buying season when many schools are making purchasing decisions for the upcoming school year.  Slideshow ( 13 images )  \u201cWe\u2019ve been at this for 40 years and we care deeply about education,\u201d Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said at the event.  Apple executives said the new iPad works with its pencil accessory and features an upgraded A10 Fusion chip, the same CPU that powers the iPhone 7. It is available immediately.  The Apple Pencil remains priced at $99 for the public and $89 for schools, though Lenovo will release a device called Crayon for $49, the first third-party stylus to work with the iPad.  Apple made up just 17 percent of the K-12 U.S. educational market in the third quarter, according to data from Futuresource Consulting. Meanwhile 60 percent of mobile computing shipments to schools ran Google\u2019s Chrome and 22 percent had Windows.  Chromebooks sold by Dell Technologies Inc cost as little as $189. Microsoft last year introduced an education-focused laptop from Lenovo Group Ltd running Windows 10 S for a similar price.  Acer Inc announced a tablet that runs Chrome OS for $329 on Monday that comes with a built-in stylus.  Apple in recent years made changes to its operating system so that more than one student can log into an iPad, and to its software to let teachers better manage students.  On Tuesday it updated iWork - which includes word processing, spreadsheet and presentation software - to allow students to take handwritten notes more easily, along with adding more free storage on its iCloud service.  Slideshow ( 13 images )  Apple also released a new app called Schoolwork to help teachers create assignments and track student progress. Google has a similar app for managing student profiles, but analysts highlighted Apple\u2019s Schoolwork app as unique in helping teachers manage assignments and progress.  The previously iPad-focused Classroom teacher administration app would start working on Mac computers in June, Apple said.  In the fall Apple will roll out \u201cEveryone Can Create\u201d lessons on video, photography, music, and drawing, joining existing \u201cEveryone Can Code\u201d guides for computer programming skills.  The new courses highlight features that some low-priced laptops do not have, such as a camera and microphone.  \u201cIf you look at it as a Chromebook competitor, it\u2019s expensive. But if you look at it and say, I can do music with GarageBand, I can take pictures or use it as a video camera and now I can do (augmented reality) ... it appeals to teachers and schools that want to push the envelope on education,\u201d Milanesi said.  Sales of iPads made up just 8.3 percent of Apple\u2019s $229.2 billion total revenue last year, compared with the nearly 62 percent of sales generated by iPhones.","1219":"BRUSSELS, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Fortnite creator Epic Games has taken its fight against Apple to EU antitrust regulators after failing to make headway in a U.S. court in a dispute over the iPhone maker\u2019s payment system on its App Store and control over apps downloads.  The two companies have been locked in a legal dispute since August last year when the game maker tried to get around Apple\u2019s 30% fee on some in-app purchases on the App Store by launching its own in-app payment system.  That prompted Apple to kick Epic\u2019s Fortnite game off the App Store and threaten to terminate an affiliated account that would have effectively blocked distribution of Unreal Engine, a software tool used by hundreds of app makers to create games.  Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney said Apple\u2019s control of its platform has tilted the level playing field.  \u201cThe 30% they charge as their app tax, they can make it 50% or 90% or 100%. Under their theory of how these markets are structured, they have every right to do that,\u201d he told reporters.  \u201cEpic is not asking any court or regulator to change this 30% to some other number, only to restore competition on IOS,\u201d he said, referring to Apple\u2019s mobile operating system.  The company also accused Apple of barring rivals from launching their own gaming subscription service on its platform by preventing them from bundling several games together - when its own service, called Apple Arcade, does that.  Apple said its rules apply equally to all developers and that Epic had violated them.  \u201cIn ways a judge has described as deceptive and clandestine, Epic enabled a feature in its app, which was not reviewed or approved by Apple, and they did so with the express intent of violating the App Store guidelines that apply equally to every developer and protect customers,\u201d the company said in a statement.  \u201cTheir reckless behaviour made pawns of customers, and we look forward to making this clear to the European Commission,\u201d it said.  The Commission, which is investigating Apple\u2019s mobile payment system Apple Pay and the App Store, declined to comment on the complaint, saying it was aware of the concerns regarding Apple\u2019s App Store rules.  Epic Games has also complained to the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal and to the Australian watchdog, at the same time seeking damages. It has not asked the EU enforcers for damages.

The Cupertino, California company\u2019s struggle to break through with India\u2019s 1.3 billion consumers swung more sharply into focus this week after Apple blamed a disappointing set of sales forecasts on a handful of big emerging markets.  Chief Executive Tim Cook said after publishing third quarter results that sales were flat in India in the fourth quarter, which includes a month-long festive season culminating this week in Diwali - a bumper period for electronics sales.  Neil Shah, research director at HongKong-based Counterpoint Research, said on Saturday its channel checks pointed to numbers for the quarter in the range of 700,000 to 800,000 units, down from about a million a year ago.  For the whole of 2018, Apple was set to sell about 2 million phones - a drop of about a million from last year, he said, as Indians balk at high prices for the devices, driven by trade tariffs and a weak rupee.  \u201cSales are set to drop for the first time in four years,\u201d Shah said. \u201cIf you look at Q3 - it was 900k last year and this (year) is almost 450k.  \u201cIphones have gone costlier and the features and specs aren\u2019t that compelling.

The Fed on Wednesday also left its monetary policy outlook for the coming years largely unchanged and while Wall Street initially rose on the day, the rally quickly fizzled as investors digested the implications of the end of an era of \u201caccommodative\u201d monetary policy.  \u201cWe had a good flush in the last few hours of yesterday, so today we are going to catch a little bit of a bounce,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York.  Apple rose 2.5 percent and was the biggest boost to the three main indexes after JP Morgan started coverage of the stock with an \u201coverweight\u201d rating, citing the iPhone maker\u2019s quicker-than-expected move to a services business.  Amazon.com rose 1.5 percent after brokerage Stifel talked up the company\u2019s retail, cloud, and advertising businesses, even as the online retailer was set to open a brick-and-mortar store in New York City.

Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by the technology sector\u2019s 0.85 percent jump.  While Apple boosted techs, one of the drags was Accenture , which fell 1.9 percent as the consulting and outsourcing services company\u2019s full-year profit fell short of analysts\u2019 estimates.  Cruise operator Carnival Corp tumbled 8.5 percent after its fourth-quarter forecast missed estimates. Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean slid 4.5 percent each, anchoring the bottom of the S&P.  Joining them was Conagra, which dropped 6 percent after posting quarterly revenue that missed analysts\u2019 estimates.

(Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Chris Reese)","1227":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc on Thursday warned that sales for the crucial holiday quarter would likely miss Wall Street expectations, which Chief Executive Tim Cook blamed on weakness in emerging markets and foreign exchange costs.  The disappointing forecast by the world\u2019s most valuable technology company helped send shares down as much as 7 percent, taking roughly $70 billion off Apple\u2019s market value and forcing that value below $1 trillion. The forecast could also deepen concerns for technology companies that saw a sell-off after misses by Amazon.com Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc.  Apple said it expects between $89 billion and $93 billion in revenue for its fiscal first quarter ending in December, with a midpoint of $91 billion coming in below Wall Street expectations of $93 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Cook in an interview with Reuters said that Apple is \u201cseeing some macroeconomic weakness in some of the emerging markets.\u201d He later told investors on a conference call that weak markets included Brazil, India, Russia and Turkey. Sales were flat in the fourth quarter in India, Cook said.  \u201cObviously, we would like to see that be a huge growth,\u201d Cook said on the call.  Executives said they also would quit giving the number of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers, leading to a further drop in the share price, since iPhone unit sales were long the key indicator of quarterly success.  Withholding that number will make it impossible to calculate the average selling price of phones, another key measure.  Apple executives said unit sales are becoming less relevant as customers buy bundled products that include subscription services like Apple Music.  Apple said it would start giving cost-of-sales data for its services business, an important metric for subscription businesses. But investors reacted negatively.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cCompanies typically stop reporting metrics when the metrics are about to turn. This is not a good look for Apple,\u201d said analyst Walter Piecyk from BTIG Research.  For the quarter ended in September, Apple brought in $62.9 billion in revenue and $2.91 per share in profits, beating expectations of $61.5 billion and $2.79, respectively.  Apple sold 46.9 million iPhones in the fiscal fourth quarter, missing analyst expectations of 47.5 million iPhones, according to FactSet. But the average selling price of iPhones was $793, well above analyst estimates of $750.78, according to FactSet.  \u201cOur worry is there must be a limit to Apple\u2019s pricing power,\u201d said George Salmon, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cThe group is now charging close to $800 per phone, and while that\u2019s helping revenues climb despite flat sales volumes, one has to wonder how the strategy to shimmy up the price ladder fares in a downturn. If consumers start feeling the pinch, those price tags could put the punters off.\u201d  In an interview with Reuters, Cook said his caution on holiday sales was in part due to Apple\u2019s earlier-than-normal launch of its top-end iPhone models, the XS and XS Max.  Cook also said foreign exchange rates would have a $2 billion negative impact on Apple\u2019s sales forecast.  Apple was unsure whether it can make enough new iPhones, Apple Watches, iPads and Mac models it released in recent weeks, Cook told Reuters. Apple is widely expanding the use of its facial recognition unlocking system in iPhones and iPads, which uses special lasers that are produced by only a handful of suppliers.  Elazar Advisors analyst Chaim Siegel said that China trade issues could be making it difficult for Apple to get the supplies it needs. \u201cAs for emerging markets slowing, that\u2019s also contagion from China. Both trade war issues coming to reality,\u201d he said.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  But Cook stressed that Apple was happy with its performance in China, where revenue grew 16 percent to $11.4 billion, the fifth quarter in a row the company has had double-digit growth in the region.  Apple\u2019s cautious forecast could accelerate investor fears that have in turn erased stock market gains for much of the year. At market close on Thursday, Apple shares had been up more than 25 percent for the year - supported by purchases by Warren Buffett and a $100 billion share buy-back program - while the Nasdaq Composite Index is nearly flat for the year.  Apple said revenue from services, which includes iCloud, the App Store and Apple Music, reached $10 billion, in line with analyst estimates. Apple investors have been increasingly focused on growth in the company\u2019s services business as consumer markets become saturated with smartphones.  Apple forecast a tax rate of 16.5 percent for the December quarter, above analyst expectations of 15.9 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  For its full fiscal 2018 ended in September, Apple reported revenue of $265.6 billion and profits of $11.91 per share, beating analyst estimates of $264 billion and $11.79 per share.","1228":"(Reuters) - The staff of the U.S. International Trade Commission on Friday recommended that a trade judge find that Apple Inc AAPL.O infringed at least one of Qualcomm Inc's QCOM.O patents, a move that could lead to blocking the import of some iPhones.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The San Diego chipmaker filed a complaint against Apple nearly a year ago, asking the commission to ban the import of iPhones containing rival chipmaker Intel Corp's INTC.O so-called modem chips, which help mobile phones connect to wireless data networks.  At a trial in Washington that started on Friday, the ITC staff said Apple violated one of Qualcomm\u2019s patents around battery-saving technology.  The ITC staff acts as a third party in such trade cases. The staff lawyers\u2019 opinions are not binding, but judges often follow them.  In previous filings in the ITC case, Apple has argued that Qualcomm\u2019s patents are invalid and that, regardless, the judge should not ban Intel-based iPhones because it would give Qualcomm a monopoly on modems in the United States and drive Intel out of the modem business.  \u201cQualcomm is selectively asserting its patents to target only Apple products containing Intel chipsets \u2014 even though its patent infringement allegations would apply equally to Apple products containing Qualcomm chipsets \u2014 in an attempt to use the ITC as another mechanism for perpetuating its ill-gotten monopoly position,\u201d Apple wrote.  The ITC case is the first to go to trial out of more than a dozen legal fights between Apple and Qualcomm over patents, licensing practices and contracts between the two. A decision is expected by January.  If the ITC judge decides to ban some iPhone imports, Qualcomm could use that to try to persuade Apple to settle or drop several of the other patent and contract cases, legal experts have said.  Apple has argued that some of Qualcomm\u2019s practices are illegal, and the chipmaker has paid billions of dollars in fines from antitrust regulators in several countries, though it is still appealing some of those rulings.  Qualcomm says its practices are legal and were accepted by customers for many years as the smartphone industry boomed, but it has made some changes to its licensing model of taking a cut of the selling price of a device in a bid to ease tensions with customers and regulators.","1229":"(Updates to add Apple, MetLife, Baxter, Petsmed and Factset) May 5 (Reuters) - A small but diverse list of companies including Apple Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp, Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble have all raised their quarterly dividends over the last few weeks, bucking the wider trend of companies across the globe cutting dividend to preserve cash and be better prepared to deal with the financial fallout of the coronavirus crisis.

The iPhone maker is establishing two grant programs to help design curriculum in silicon and hardware engineering for historically Black schools.  Apple will also establish an app development academy in Detroit, its first in the United States. The academy provides a free 10-to-12-month course and will aim to teach 1,000 students a year skills in coding, design and marketing. The facility in Detroit will work with Michigan State University.  \u201cWe wanted to see more Black and brown developers,\u201d Jackson said, noting that Apple has long worked with historically Black schools. \u201cThey tend to be focusing on the southeastern part of the United States. But Detroit has over 50,000 small businesses that are owned by Black and brown people. And so it seemed to us that there was an entrepreneurial opportunity.\u201d","1235":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc is preparing to release three new smartphones later this year, including the largest iPhone ever, a device that may have a bigger display than arch-rival Samsung\u2019s flagship phone, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the products.  FILE PHOTO: Boxes of iPhone X are pictured during its launch at the Apple store in Singapore, November 3, 2017. REUTERS\/Edgar Su\/File Photo  The trio also includes an upgraded handset the same size as the current iPhone X and a less expensive model with some of the X\u2019s key features.  The new phones could revive the screen size wars of years past at a time when smartphone makers are straining to come up with new features to lure buyers in a saturated market. Global smartphone sales were down 0.1 percent last year, according to research firm IDC, with Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd expanding shipments only 1.9 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively.  The iPhone maker is already running production tests with suppliers and is expected to announce the new phones this fall. However, the plans could still change, the report said. (bloom.bg\/2HNO4wg)  Apple declined to comment. Its shares were up almost 2 percent at $178.95 in midday trade. Earlier in the day, billionaire Warren Buffett talked up his company\u2019s stake in the iPhone maker, which also helped boost shares.  Bloomberg reported the largest iPhone could have a screen of close to 6.5 inches (16.5 cm), larger than the 6.2-inch (15.75 cm) Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus announced on Monday in Barcelona, Spain, and larger than the current Samsung Note 8\u2019s 6.3-inch screen. Samsung traditionally announces new Note series devices in the fall, so it is possible it might launch a larger screen around the same time Apple\u2019s new models hit the market.  But Bob O\u2019Donnell, head of Technalysis Research, said the reported trio of new iPhones was \u201ca very logical extension of the product line\u201d for Apple: \u201cOne bigger, one cheaper, and one upgrade to the existing iPhone X.\u201d  The Cupertino-based company earlier this month forecast disappointing revenue of $60 billion to $62 billion for its fiscal second quarter ending in March, with a number of media reports pointing to slack demand for iPhone X after unit sales failed to meet expectations in the run-up to Christmas.  With global smartphone sales roughly flat, vendors are focusing on features designed to encourage consumers to ditch their old phones earlier than they would have previously.  \u201cThe whole nature of smartphone purchase decisions have changed,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about what is the newest, greatest model. It\u2019s about when is my phone so old I need to upgrade, and what\u2019s available when I need a new one.\u201d  Samsung on Sunday unveiled its flagship Galaxy S9 smartphone with an emphasis on visual applications for social media, improved cameras, and an artificial intelligence-powered voice tool.  Bloomberg said the body of the larger phone will be about the same size as the iPhone 8 Plus, but the screen will be about an inch larger than 8 Plus\u2019s, thanks to edge-to-edge design. Apple also plans a gold-colored device to help boost sales in Asia, Bloomberg reported.  Apple is also preparing an update to the regular-sized iPhone X, Bloomberg said, adding that the phones are expected to use next-generation A12 processors and will continue to include stainless steel edges and will be Apple\u2019s high-end smartphone offerings.  What remains unclear is whether Apple will also cut any current iPhone models from its lineup. The company has kept older models like the iPhone SE - essentially an updated iPhone 5 - on shelves to an unprecedented degree, providing lower-priced offerings for developing markets like India.  Apple has also embraced the used iPhone market as a way to expand its share of smartphone users. When customers sell their old iPhone for a new one, the old iPhone \u201cwinds up with another customer somewhere else that is perfectly fine with having a previously owned iPhone,\u201d CEO Tim Cook told investors on an earnings call earlier this month.","1236":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O on Tuesday introduced a MacBook Air notebook and other machines with its first central processor designed in-house for Macs, a move that will tie its computers and iPhones closer together technologically.  The new chip, called the M1, marks a shift away from Intel Corp INTC.O technology that has driven the electronic brains of Mac computers for nearly 15 years.  It is a boon for Apple computers, which are overshadowed by the company\u2019s iPhone but still rack up tens of billions of dollars in sales per year. Apple hopes developers now will create families of apps that work on both its computers and phones.  The MacBook Air will start at $999, the same as its predecessor, and have up to twice the battery life, Apple said. The M1 will also power the MacBook Pro notebook, which starts at $1299, and its $699 Mac Mini computer, which comes without a monitor.  The new products will be available from next week, executives said.  Shares of Apple were up about 0.2% as the event ended.  Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights & Strategy, estimated Apple will save between $150 and $200 per chip in costs by using its own central processors. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see Apple add any expensive features,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going with a much higher margin.\u201d  EFFICIENT AND FAST  In June, Apple said it would begin outfitting Macs with its own chips, building on its decade-long history of designing processors for its iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches.  Apple executives said on Tuesday that the M1 was intended to be efficient as well as fast, to improve battery life, and that Apple\u2019s newest version of its operating system was tuned to the processor.  \u201cThis announcement underscores how important high-performance, custom processor designs will be to leading the next generation of client computing,\u201d said Jon Carvill, vice president of Nuvia, a data center chip firm founded by former Apple executives. \u201cWe think a similar trend is playing out in the future of the data center as well.\u201d  Apple executives made numerous performance claims against prior generations of Macs and Windows-based laptops, virtually all of which are based on Intel chips, though Apple did not directly name Intel.  \u201cWe believe Intel-powered PCs \u2014 like those based on 11th Gen Intel Core mobile processors \u2014 provide global customers the best experience in the areas they value most, as well as the most open platform for developers, both today and into the future,\u201d Intel said in a statement.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Apple's phone chips draw on computing architecture technology from UK-based Arm Ltd, manufactured by outside partners such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp 2330.TW.  Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Qualcomm Corp QCOM.O have been working together for four years to bring Arm-based Windows laptops to market, with major manufacturers such as Lenovo Group Ltd 0992.HK, Asustek Computer 2357.TW and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS offering machines.  But for both Microsoft and Apple, the true test will be software developers. Apple is hoping that the massive group of iPhone developers will embrace the new Macs, which will share a common 64-bit Arm computing architecture with the iPhone and be able to use similar apps.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Apple software chief Craig Federighi said Adobe Inc ADBE.O would bring its Photoshop software to the new M1-based Macs early next year.  \u201cThe app ecosystem and the battery life are probably the two things people will gravitate to,\u201d said Ben Bajarin, principal analyst for consumer market intelligence at Creative Strategies.  Apple has seen a boom in Mac sales due to the coronavirus pandemic, notching record fiscal fourth quarter Mac sales of $9 billion earlier this month - all of them Intel-based. In June, Chief Executive Tim Cook said Apple would continue to support those devices for \u201cyears to come\u201d but did not specify an end-of-life date.","1237":"FILE PHOTO: A salesman uses his iPhone at a mobile phone store in New Delhi, India, July 27, 2016.

The chief executive of developer Mobicip, Suren Ramasubbu, told Reuters he was interviewed in November by a U.S. investigator who asked about the company\u2019s interactions with Apple. The app, which has nearly a million users worldwide, allows parents to control what their children see on their iPhones.  Ramasubbu said the Mobicip app was temporarily removed from the iPhone app store last year for a failure to meet requirements imposed by Apple.  A source familiar with the Justice Department\u2019s investigation said a handful of app developers had been contacted in what is the first indication of what officials are pursuing involving Apple since the investigation was revealed by Reuters in June.  U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized Apple\u2019s Silicon Valley neighbors for other reasons, calling for closer scrutiny of social media companies and Google and accusing them of suppressing conservative voices online, without presenting any evidence.  U.S. Attorney General William Barr said in December that he hoped to have the Justice Department investigations into the big tech platforms - Facebook Inc FB.O, Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Apple - wrapped up this year.  Apple declined comment, but pointed to a statement on its website that says its app store was designed to hold apps \u201cto a high standard for privacy, security and content.\u201d  Slideshow ( 2 images )  \u201cSince 2016, we have removed over 1.4 million apps from the App Store because they have not been updated or don\u2019t work on our most current operating systems,\u201d the site says.  Apple\u2019s ability to do just that has been a point of contention in the courtroom. The company was accused in lawsuits last year of abusing its clout in the app market. In one case, the U.S. Supreme Court gave the go-ahead last May to an antitrust lawsuit that accused Apple of forcing consumers to overpay for iPhone software applications.  SCREEN TIME CONTROL  Apple introduced its Screen Time app, which includes parental controls, in June 2018. At the start of 2019, Ramasubbu told Reuters, his company was contacted by Apple and warned that Mobicip\u2019s app violated the iPhone-maker\u2019s rules relating to technical elements that had previously been acceptable.  The app was removed from the app store for about six months, during which time it was updated to be compliant with Apple rules, Ramasubbu said. It was reinstated in October 2019, but he estimates his company\u2019s business has shrunk by half.  Six executives of parental control app companies interviewed by Reuters said they had a comfortable relationship with Apple until mid-2018. That is when Apple introduced its own, similar software giving parents oversight of their children\u2019s phone screen time and searches.  Apple has said that it had been concerned about parental control apps using technology which gave developers access to sensitive data, and that they declined to approve apps that used the technology if they did not also commit to not sharing data on children.  As the arbiter of who is allowed to sell in the app store, Apple says it has the power to ensure that only the highest quality apps are sold there.  But some developers say it also allows Apple to push out apps that compete with its own products, thus strengthening its profits at a time with its device sales have stagnated and it is seeking new sources of revenue.","1240":"TAIPEI\/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Apple's AAPL.O top iPhone assembler, Taiwan-based Foxconn, has set up a task force to fend off the growing clout of Chinese electronics manufacturer Luxshare, which it believes poses a serious threat to its dominance, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.  FILE PHOTO: Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way speaks at an event presenting the company's new technologies in Taipei, Taiwan October 16, 2020. REUTERS\/Yimou Lee\/File Photo  The project was initiated by Foxconn's founder Terry Gou, according to one of the sources, to target Dongguan-based Luxshare 002475.SZ, which is little-known internationally but is poised to become the first mainland China-headquartered firm to assemble iPhones - a turf until now dominated by Taiwanese manufacturers.  The task force, which the sources say was created last year, has been looking into Luxshare\u2019s technology, expansion plan, hiring strategy and whether the company - which currently makes only 5% of Foxconn\u2019s revenue - is supported by any Chinese government entity.  While the U.S.-China trade war and the coronavirus crisis have intensified pressure on global supply chains, an increasingly acrimonious tech feud between the economic giants has also prompted Beijing to strengthen efforts on creating world-leading local tech firms - and Luxshare\u2019s growth trajectory fits into that mould.  \u201cLuxshare is set to rise ... it\u2019s just a matter of how fast it could be,\u201d one of the sources said.  \u201cIt makes sense for China to build up its own supply chain and Luxshare is in line with that state policy.\u201d  RED SUPPLY CHAIN  That state policy, analysts say, is gaining traction with the rise of China\u2019s \u201cred supply chain\u201d, where Chinese firms with apparent government support increasingly take on the work of manufacturing products for Apple and other global firms.  \u201cFacing the rise of the red supply chain, the threat of Taiwan manufacturers being replaced continues to increase,\u201d Market Intelligence & Consulting Institute, a think tank backed by Taiwan government, wrote in a September report.  Luxshare, whose chairwoman was once a worker at Taiwanese Apple supplier Foxlink 2392.TW, acquired two smaller factories belonging to Taiwanese iPhone assembler Wistron in China in July. Previously, Luxshare was best known for making Apple's AirPods.  One of the sources called it a \u201cformidable opponent\u201d, and said Foxconn has been conducting extensive research on Luxshare, aiming to \u201cdefeat it completely.\u201d  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The sources, who have direct knowledge of the matter and are familiar with Foxconn\u2019s thinking, declined to be named citing the sensitivity of the issue.  Public records reveal that while Luxshare is majority-owned by Grace Wang and her brother Wang Laisheng, its minority shareholders include state-owned Chinese investment company Central Huijin Investment Ltd, which has a 1.38% stake.  Luxshare has also received over 1 billion yuan ($148.80 million) in government subsidies since 2016 to the first half of this year, a Reuters calculation of its financial reports shows. Roughly half of that sum came in 2019 alone.  Foxconn told Reuters in a statement the task force described in this story is \u201cnot grounded in facts\u201d and there were \u201cno meetings or any other contact.\u201d  \u201cThere have also been no other extraordinary actions taken by the management team.\u201d It did not elaborate.  Luxshare declined to comment. Apple did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.  \u2018BLOOD IN THE WATER\u2019  Luxshare was founded in 2004 by Grace Wang, who told Taiwan\u2019s Business Today in July that she was once a worker at Foxlink, owned by Gou\u2019s brother, T.C. Gou.  Its journey up Apple\u2019s value chain has been driven in part by acquiring smaller components makers, starting with the manufacturing of connector cables for the iPhone and Macbook through a 2011 acquisition of its Dongguan neighbour Lanto Electronics, then by making acoustic components for the iPhone, and eventually by manufacturing airpods.  The company\u2019s revenue has risen in tandem with its advance up Apple\u2019s value chain - sales in 2019 hit 62.5 billion yuan, up 75% year-on-year.  That\u2019s roughly 5% of Foxconn\u2019s revenue, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry, although investor bets on the company\u2019s prospects have lifted its market value to roughly $20 billion above the Taiwan firm\u2019s $39 billion market capitalisation.  Luxshare now gets 58% of its revenue from Apple, according to Morningstar Research  The company\u2019s July acquisition of Wistron\u2019s iPhone plants in Kunshan marks its most significant deal yet, which Fubon Research said could help Luxshare capture up to 30% of iPhone production within the next five years.  Two of the sources familiar with Foxconn said Luxshare had also been actively poaching from Foxconn. In one case, one of the sources said, Luxshare offered 500,000 yuan ($75,009) cash upfront as a relocation subsidy for a senior Foxconn employee to move family from Taiwan to China.  David Collins, a manufacturing consultant based in Taipei and Kunshan, says that Chinese firms see both Foxconn\u2019s legacy status, coupled with its move away from China, as prime opportunity to usurp it.  \u201cFoxconn\u2019s share price is down roughly 50% from two years ago. They see blood in the water.\u201d  ($1 = 6.6658 Chinese yuan renminbi)","1241":"PARIS (Reuters) - STMicroelectronics on Wednesday delivered an upbeat assessment on second-half demand for its smartphones-focused products in second-half, brushing off investor anxiety over the soft takeoff of Apple\u2019s iPhone X.

With the card, Apple aims to draw in iPhone owners with 2% cash back on purchases with the Apple Pay service, no fees and an app to manage related finances.  For Goldman, the card will enhance the bank\u2019s focus on its Marcus consumer banking brand, which it started in 2015 to even out volatile results from businesses such as trading and investment banking.  Apple shares were up about 1 percent at $195.30 in trading before the bell.  The company said a limited number of the people who had expressed interest in Apple Card would start receiving sign-up invitations on Tuesday.  \u201cThe Apple Card doesn\u2019t play in the same league as premium rewards credit cards like the Chase Sapphire Reserve or AmEx Platinum,\u201d said Sara Rathner, an expert on credit cards at NerdWallet.  \u201cThose cards charge ultra-high fees, but in return you get some pretty sweet perks: massive sign-up bonuses, annual statement credits, free Global Entry, and a higher point-earning rate for travel expenses.\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Apple will offer an option for a physical card made of titanium, but with no visible number. Instead, the card\u2019s number is stored on a secure chip inside the iPhone, which will generate virtual numbers for online or over-the-phone purchases that require a number.  Apple said purchase information would be stored on the user\u2019s iPhone and that it cannot see the data. Goldman will not be allowed to use data for marketing purposes, even for selling its other products.  Gene Munster, managing partner with Loup Ventures and a longtime Apple watcher, said the card\u2019s adoption is likely to be low in the first year, but it could generate about $1.4 billion of high-margin revenue by 2023.  That would add about 1.8% to Apple\u2019s overall earnings and complement the much larger Apple Pay business for total payments revenue of $5.38 billion by 2023. Apple has roughly 50 million U.S. Apple Pay users now.  But at Apple\u2019s size - $265.6 billion in sales for fiscal 2018 - the revenue matters less than the effect on keeping Apple customers tied to its brand, said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies.  \u201cIf it works, it\u2019s one more thing that causes you to stay deeply loyal and entrenched in the Apple ecosystem, even if something better comes along,\u201d he said.","1246":"TOKYO, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Japan Display Inc dismissed an accounting executive last December for embezzling about 570 million yen ($5.25 million) of the company\u2019s money over four years since the Apple Inc supplier went public, the Asahi daily reported on Thursday.

The Apple Card customer agreement said the card cannot be used to purchase cash advances or cash equivalents that include cryptocurrencies, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or lottery tickets. Goldman declined to comment and Apple did not immediately respond to request for comment.  The Apple Card is part of a broader effort by Apple to derive more of its revenue from services after years of heavily reliance on iPhone sales, which declined 12% in the most recent quarter.  For Goldman\u2019s part, the Apple partnership is part of the longtime investment bank\u2019s effort to build out a consumer-facing business.  Apple and Goldman are not alone in banning the purchase of cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin with credit cards. Major American and British banks Lloyds Banking Group Plc LLOY.L and Virgin Money VM.L banned such purchases here last year, following the lead of U.S. banking giants JP Morgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Citigroup C.N.

The tech giant, which is known for its long-serving top executives, did not give a reason for the departure. It comes as Apple tries to reverse a slide in sales of its iPhones.  Ahrendts, who is among Apple\u2019s highest-paid executives, came to the company in 2014 after being chief executive of fashion retailer Burberry Group Plc .  During her tenure, the company redesigned its retail stores with an emphasis on Apple\u2019s appeal as a luxury brand and opened locations in pricy districts such as a glass-walled store on Chicago\u2019s Michigan Avenue last autumn.  Ahrendts undertook some controversial moves, such as removing the formal Apple \u201cGenius Bar\u201d for technical service from stores and setting up more casual service centers instead. The introduction of a \u201cGenius Grove\u201d of potted plants at Apple\u2019s flagship San Francisco location generated some complaints about customer service.  She also cut the number of outside companies selling accessories such as phone cases in Apple\u2019s stores, dedicating the space to Apple\u2019s own, generally more expensive, accessories.  Apple has long leaned on outsiders for help running its stores since former CEO Steve Jobs tapped Ron Johnson in 2000 to build Apple\u2019s retail operations. By the time of his departure a decade later, Apple had a string of stores that were the envy of the shopping industry, generating sales per square foot that rivaled luxury jewelers.  Apple briefly tapped British retail executive John Browett to run its stores before hiring Ahrendts. In her five years in the post, she presided over only modest growth in the number of locations, expanding from 437 stores in Apple\u2019s fiscal 2014 to slightly more than 500 today, but she renovated many older locations.  Ahrendts made $26.6 million in Apple\u2019s fiscal 2018, more than Apple CEO Tim Cook but on par with the compensation of other senior executives. Her tenure was relatively short compared to executives such as services chief Eddy Cue, Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams or marketing chief Phil Schiller, each of whom has worked at Apple more than 20 years.  Apple named human resources chief Deirdre O\u2019Brien as senior vice president of \u201cRetail + People\u201d to replace Ahrendts. O\u2019Brien has worked at Apple for more than 30 years.  Last month, Apple disclosed the first-ever decline in holiday season sales of the iPhone since the device\u2019s introduction more than a decade ago. It also warned investors that sales for the current quarter were likely to be lower than Wall Street expected.","1249":"FILE PHOTO: Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks during an Apple special event at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California, U.S., March 25, 2019.

Apple in March said it will launch a streaming service with original content from big names including Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg. It plans to spend $2 billion on programming but has not said how much the service will cost.  Investors are keeping a close eye on Apple\u2019s television efforts because subscription services are an increasingly important part of its financial results as iPhone sales decline.  Apple is entering a crowded field, including Walt Disney Co\u2019s $6.99 per month service launching this fall. At the other end of the price spectrum, Alphabet Inc\u2019s YouTube this month said that it was raising the price of its YouTube TV online service, a cable-like bundle of more than 70 channels, to $49.99 per month.  On a conference call with investors on Tuesday, Cook indicated that Apple will not try to give viewers everything they want.  \u201cThere\u2019s a huge move from the cable bundle to over-the-top,\u201d Cook told investors during a call on Tuesday, referring to streaming television services delivered over the internet rather than a traditional cable service.  \u201cWe think that most users are going to get multiple over-the-top products, and we\u2019re going to do our best to convince them that the Apple TV+ product should be one of them.\u201d","1250":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended lower on Friday after an up-and-down session as investors weighed spiking cases of COVID-19 and Apple Inc\u2019s announcement of fresh store closures against anticipated stimulus and continued economic recovery.

Apple Inc announced it is temporarily shutting some stores again in Florida, Arizona, South Carolina and North Carolina, which have seen a spike in coronavirus cases in recent days.  \u201cApple is the canary in the coalmine with respect to other businesses,\u201d Keator added.

New cases of COVID-19 set records across at least six U.S. states, and mandated mask use is becoming more common as economies continue reopening. China, where the pandemic originated but had been contained, also reported an uptick in new cases of the disease.  Still, for the week, the S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq posted solid percentage gains.  The S&P 500 and the Dow are now at 8.5% and 12.5% shy of their respective all-time highs reached in February.

Of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500, 10 lost ground, with healthcare the sole gainer.

AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc, the world\u2019s largest movie theater operator, dipped 2.0% after its announcement that it would reopen theaters at about 450 locations in the United States next month was tempered by renewed shutdown fears.  Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.66-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.15-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

If a phone user is found to be infected, people who spent more than 15 minutes within a radius of one meter (3.3 feet) of that individual sometime over the previous 14 days will be notified that they were in close contact with a coronavirus-infected person, and be prompted to seek medical consultation.

The drop in Apple\u2019s stock is set to wipe nearly $30 billion off its market capitalization, just as it was inching closer to $1.5 trillion in value. The stock was trading down at $318.74.  However, several Wall Street brokerages dubbed Apple\u2019s update forecast as a \u201cnear-term headwind,\u201d saying the company is performing strongly outside China and the launch of 5G phones later this year would further boost sales.  \u201cWe believe any material weakness in Apple shares as a result of the March 20 quarter revenue shortfall will prove to be a buying opportunity,\u201d analysts at Piper Sandler wrote in a client note.  \u201cThe iPhone supply constraints in the current quarter could result in pent-up demand for future quarters,\u201d they said.  In late January, Apple had forecast $63 billion to $67 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in March. It did not provide a new revenue estimate or a profit forecast on Monday.  Venture capital firm Loup Ventures expects March quarter revenue to be in the range of between $58 billion and $60 billion, with a 12% contribution from Greater China.  Manufacturing plants in China that produce Apple\u2019s iPhone and other electronics have begun to reopen, but they are ramping up more slowly than expected, Apple said on Monday. That will mean fewer iPhones available for sale.  One of the primary iPhone manufacturing facilities in China is operating at a 25% factory utilization rate as many workers remain absent, Cowen analysts estimated.  \u201cWe believe utilization rates will improve linearly over the next several weeks to ~50% by mid-March and followed by a big improvement in late March to normal levels.\u201d  Brokerage Canaccord Genuity expects Apple to sell 38 million iPhone units during the current quarter, eight million less from its earlier estimate.

The iPhone maker\u2019s automotive efforts, known as Project Titan, have proceeded unevenly since 2014 when it first started to design its own vehicle from scratch. At one point, Apple drew back the effort to focus on software and reassessed its goals. Doug Field, an Apple veteran who had worked at Tesla Inc, returned to oversee the project in 2018 and laid off 190 people from the team in 2019.  Since then, Apple has progressed enough that it now aims to build a vehicle for consumers, two people familiar with the effort said, asking not to be named because Apple\u2019s plans are not public. Apple\u2019s goal of building a personal vehicle for the mass market contrasts with rivals such as Alphabet Inc\u2019s Waymo, which has built robo-taxis to carry passengers for a driverless ride-hailing service.  Central to Apple\u2019s strategy is a new battery design that could \u201cradically\u201d reduce the cost of batteries and increase the vehicle\u2019s range, according to a third person who has seen Apple\u2019s battery design.  Apple declined to comment on its plans or future products.  Making a vehicle represents a supply chain challenge even for Apple, a company with deep pockets that makes hundreds of millions of electronics products each year with parts from around the world, but has never made a car. It took Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla 17 years before it finally turned a sustained profit making cars.  \u201cIf there is one company on the planet that has the resources to do that, it\u2019s probably Apple. But at the same time, it\u2019s not a cellphone,\u201d said a person who worked on Project Titan.  It remains unclear who would assemble an Apple-branded car, but sources have said they expect the company to rely on a manufacturing partner to build vehicles. And there is still a chance Apple will decide to reduce the scope of its efforts to an autonomous driving system that would be integrated with a car made by a traditional automaker, rather than the iPhone maker selling an Apple-branded car, one of the people added.  Two people with knowledge of Apple\u2019s plans warned pandemic-related delays could push the start of production into 2025 or beyond.

Apple has decided to tap outside partners for elements of the system, including lidar sensors, which help self-driving cars get a three-dimensional view of the road, two people familiar with the company\u2019s plans said.  Apple\u2019s car might feature multiple lidar sensors for scanning different distances, another person said. Some sensors could be derived from Apple\u2019s internally developed lidar units, that person said. Apple\u2019s iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro models released this year both feature lidar sensors.  Reuters had previously reported that Apple had held talks with potential lidar suppliers, but it was also examining building its own sensor.  As for the car\u2019s battery, Apple plans to use a unique \u201cmonocell\u201d design that bulks up the individual cells in the battery and frees up space inside the battery pack by eliminating pouches and modules that hold battery materials, one of the people said.  Apple\u2019s design means that more active material can be packed inside the battery, giving the car a potentially longer range. Apple is also examining a chemistry for the battery called LFP, or lithium iron phosphate, the person said, which is inherently less likely to overheat and is thus safer than other types of lithium-ion batteries.  \u201dIt\u2019s next level,\u201d the person said of Apple\u2019s battery technology. \u201cLike the first time you saw the iPhone.\u201d  Apple had previously engaged Magna International Inc in talks about manufacturing a car, but the talks petered out as Apple\u2019s plans became unclear, a person familiar with those previous efforts said. Magna did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  To turn a profit, automotive contract manufacturers often ask for volumes that could pose a challenge even to Apple, which would be a newcomer to the automotive market.  \u201cIn order to have a viable assembly plant, you need 100,000 vehicles annually, with more volume to come,\u201d the person said.  Some Apple investors reacted to the Reuters report on the company\u2019s plans with caution. Trip Miller, managing partner at Apple investor Gullane Capital Partners, said it could be tough for Apple to produce large volumes of cars out of the gate.  \u201cIt would seem to me that if Apple develops some advanced operating system or battery technology, it would be best utilized in a partnership with an existing manufacturer under license,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAs we see with Tesla and the legacy auto companies, having a very complex manufacturing network around the globe doesn\u2019t happen overnight.\u201d  Hal Eddins, chief economist at Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said Apple has a history of higher margins than most automakers.  \u201cMy initial reaction as a shareholder is, huh?\u201d Eddins said. \u201cStill don\u2019t really see the appeal of the car business, but Apple may be eyeing another angle than what I\u2019m seeing.\u201d","1255":"FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc. store is seen in Los Angeles, California, U.S., September 16, 2016.

In other recent actions against Jones, Facebook suspended the radio and Internet host\u2019s personal profile for 30 days in late July from Facebook\u2019s site for what the company said was bullying and hate speech.  Also, Spotify, a music and podcast streaming company, removed some specific episodes of Jones\u2019s programs last week.  \u201cWe take reports of hate content seriously and review any podcast episode or song that is flagged by our community,\u201d a spokesperson said late on Sunday.  \u201cSpotify can confirm it has removed specific episodes of \u2018The Alex Jones Show\u2019 podcast for violating our hate content policy,\u201d the spokesperson said.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Sandra Rivera, who oversees Intel\u2019s networking chip business, said at a media event in Palo Alto, California, that sample 5G modem chips will ship to customers this year but that Intel does not expect consumer \u201cproducts in the market\u201d until 2020.  Intel has said its 5G modem chip will be available later this year, but it never indicated when it believed products will arrive for consumers. Rivera said non-consumer 5G products, such as networking gear, will appear later this year.  It was unclear whether Intel\u2019s timing on modem chips means that Apple will not have an iPhone with 5G capabilities in 2019. Bloomberg previously reported that Apple would not have a 5G iPhone ready until 2020.  Apple executives have held talks with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and MediaTek Inc over 5G modem chips for iPhones to be released this year, but the outcome of those talks is unknown.  Reuters reported on Feb. 7 that Apple earlier this year moved its modem engineering efforts into the same division that makes its proprietary processor chips.  Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  While Apple remains Intel\u2019s only major modem chip customer now, Intel Chief Executive Bob Swan said the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker plans to pursue other lines of business, such as selling modems to carmakers.  He also said that modems could appear in a range of other devices, such as network gear, alongside Intel\u2019s computing chips as 5G networks proliferate. But Intel executives declined to comment on whether Intel would combine its modem and processors into a single chip the way that rivals such as San Diego-based Qualcomm Inc have done.  Swan said Intel did not plan to generate patent licensing revenue from its 5G technology like its Southern California competitor does.  \u201cOur model relative to other California-based players is just completely different,\u201d Swan said. \u201cOurs is not a licensing based model.  \u201cRoyalty streams that are charged against the cost of the entire device, that\u2019s a model that as you know has caused quite a bit of friction in the market,\u201d Swan continued, alluding to Qualcomm\u2019s legal battles with Apple and other phone makers over the San Diego firm\u2019s patent practices. \u201cFriction for others is opportunity for us.\u201d  (The story is refiled to add missing \u201cs\u201d from \u201ctalks\u201d in paragraph five.)","1261":"April 17 (Reuters) -  * APPLE PLANS TO INTEGRATE MAGAZINE APP TEXTURE INTO APPLE NEWS AND DEBUT ITS OWN PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION OFFERING - BLOOMBERG, CITING SOURCES Source text - bloom.bg\/2qCGVIb Further company coverage:","1262":"* Boeing, Caterpillar, 3M down roughly 1 pct  * Tesla jumps after cash burn worries abate  * Dow down 0.47 pct, S&P dips 0.07 pct  * Nasdaq up 0.31 pct, lifted by gains in tech stocks (Changes comment, adds details, updates prices)  By Amy Caren Daniel  Aug 2 (Reuters) - Apple became the first U.S. company to top $1 trillion in market value on Thursday, leading a rebound in technology stocks that helped Wall Street pare losses and turned the Nasdaq positive.

(Reuters) - Authorities in 23 countries across five continents have sought access to contact tracing technology from Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, the companies announced on Wednesday as they released the initial version of their system.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  But authorities would have to stop requiring phone numbers from users under the companies\u2019 rules, one of several restrictions that have left governments fighting the novel coronavirus frustrated that the world\u2019s top two smartphone software makers undercut the technology\u2019s usefulness by prioritizing user privacy.  Apple and Google said several U.S. states and 22 countries have sought access to their technology, but it is unclear how many will end up publishing mobile apps that use it.  Using apps to accelerate contact tracing, in which authorities identify and test people who were recently near a virus carrier, has emerged as a tool to stem new outbreaks. It could help authorities test more potentially infected individuals than they would normally be able to based on patients recalling recent interactions from memory.  But some governments contend their app-based efforts would be more effective if they could track users\u2019 locations to identify hot spots for virus transmission and notify them about possible exposure through calls or texts, rather than a generic push notification.  Apple and Google have barred authorities using their technology from collecting GPS location data or requiring users to enter personal data.  \u201cWe have a collision of tech, privacy and health professionals and the Venn diagram doesn\u2019t really have a spot where they all overlap,\u201d said Chester Wisniewski, a principal research scientist at cybersecurity company Sophos.  Australia, the United Kingdom and other countries that have sought to develop their own technology are experiencing glitches, draining device batteries and seeing limited adoption.  Apple and Google have said their system will more reliably use Bluetooth connections between devices to log users who are in physical proximity for at least five minutes.  Developers of contact tracing apps for Austria, Germany and Switzerland told Reuters this week they were moving forward with the Apple-Google technology and were fine not knowing users\u2019 phone numbers.  Other governments are hedging their bets. Norway plans to compare the effectiveness of its Smittestopp app with an Apple-Google-based app, Gun Peggy Knudsen, acting deputy director of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said in an interview.  Smittestopp, which has a development budget of about $5 million, accesses GPS location and requires phone numbers. But it has seen limited use because of a low number of new infections.  \u201cIf the tracing is so much better with the Apple-Google tool, then perhaps we should switch and we would consider what we need to do to do the switch,\u201d Knudsen said.  North Dakota, which offered the first U.S. contact tracing app, told Reuters on Wednesday it will leave its initial Care19 app as a location-tracking \u201cdiary\u201d tool to help patients jog their memories. But it also will release a new Care19 Exposure app based on the Apple-Google technology.

Apple said earlier this month that an internal investigation had found that a \u201csmall number of our users\u2019 accounts were accessed through phishing scams where two-factor authentication was not enabled\u201d.  The U.S. company, which makes and sells huge numbers of its products in China, added the issue had also led to a rise in \u201cfalse and fraudulent refund claims trying to take advantage of this incident.\u201d  The China Consumer Association said in a statement on its website that Apple should not shirk its responsibility and should compensate consumers in full.  \u201cApple should not shift the blame, play down its own safety issues and divert consumers\u2019 attention,\u201d the association said. The case was trending in the top 10 most-read topics on China\u2019s Twitter-like social media platform Weibo on Friday.  The issue is a potential headache for Apple in the world\u2019s second-largest economy, with the U.S. firm already facing a potentially tough balancing act in the country amid a whipsawing trade war between the United States and China.  Chinese mobile payment platform Alipay said last week that hackers had taken an unknown amount of money from user accounts using stolen Apple IDs and the issue remained unresolved despite reaching out to the U.S. firm.  Apple declined to comment further on Friday, referring back to its earlier statement on the matter.  \u201cWe regret the inconvenience caused to our customers by these phishing scams,\u201d the firm said in that statement.  \u201cWe are proactively identifying suspicious activities and reaching out to affected customers.

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - The victor of a battle can still end up losing the war. But Apple\u2019s win in a legal case over $15 billion of back taxes that the European Commission ordered the tech giant to pay to Ireland flags the problems that Europe\u2019s antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, faces in a bigger fight over corporate tax reform.  The European Union\u2019s second-highest court on Wednesday rejected the commission\u2019s order. It said that the EU executive did not clear the legal bar required to show that Apple had benefited from illegal state aid via two Irish tax rulings that artificially reduced its tax burden for over two decades \u2013 to as low as 0.005% in 2014. Vestager has yet to decide whether to appeal the ruling, but there was a lot riding on this case, especially because Ireland was fighting at Apple\u2019s side and against her.  The alliance between the company and the country may seem odd given the coronavirus pandemic has blown a gaping hole in Ireland\u2019s finances. The budget deficit is expected to soar to as much as 30 billion euros, or 10% of GDP, this year. But Ireland\u2019s 12.5% corporate tax rate is a draw for foreign companies like Apple, Facebook and Twitter. They employ one in 10 people in the country, often in high-paid jobs that have so far proved more resilient to the crisis. The side that Dublin picked shows that low-tax EU countries will be loath to jeopardise employment and their long-term appeal to foreign companies.  This means that Vestager will face stiff internal resistance from within the EU to any attempt to impose a region-wide digital tax, as well as fierce pushback from U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Washington last month suggested a pause in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development talks to reach a global accord on taxing digital services. While an EU-level proposal would allow European countries to push ahead regardless, Ireland may make even a regional accord difficult to achieve. With allies likes these, Apple and other tech giants have a hope of winning the war as well as the battle.","1271":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple won back its crown as the most valuable publicly listed U.S. company on Wednesday, ending the session with a market capitalization above recent leaders Microsoft and Amazon.com.

Apple\u2019s shares slumped 9.2 percent after the company slashed its holiday-quarter revenue forecast saying sales in China slowed more than expected, the first major warning with the U.S. earnings season around the corner.  Meanwhile, Institute of Supply Management data showed U.S. manufacturing activity slowed more than expected in December, with the index of national factory activity dropping to 54.1 last month and missing economists\u2019 estimate of 57.9.  That comes after data earlier this week showed a deceleration in factory activity in China and the euro zone, indicating the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute was taking a toll on global manufacturing.  \u201cWe are seeing markets extrapolate Apple\u2019s news throughout several sectors and equate it to a deceleration in the global economy,\u201d said Christopher Anselmo, director at Nasdaq IR Intelligence in New York City.  \u201cA lot of data in the past few days, including U.S. factory activity is pointing to a global economic slowdown.

Within tech, chipmakers, which count both Apple and China as major customers, were hit the hardest. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index slumped 4.36 percent.  The trade-sensitive industrials dropped 2.75 percent, while materials fell 2.39 percent and three other sectors were logging declines of roughly 2 percent.  At 11:01 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 569.72 points, or 2.44 percent, at 22,776.52, the S&P 500 was down 49.31 points, or 1.96 percent, at 2,460.72 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 148.41 points, or 2.23 percent, at 6,517.53.  The grim reading rocked financial markets, sending investors to the relative safety of government Treasuries and bond-proxies stock sectors. Even among them only real estate gained, while utilities and consumer staples nursed slight losses.  While the recent selloff has made stocks cheaper, with the S&P 500\u2019s valuation falling to 14 times expected earnings from 18 times a year earlier, earnings estimates have also been cut sharply.  Analysts on average expect earnings per share at S&P 500 companies to rise nearly 7 percent this year, down from a 10 percent forecast at the start of October and far below their expectations of 24 percent EPS growth for 2018, according to Refinitiv\u2019s IBES.  \u201cAs we head towards the earnings season, investors are getting more and more concerned about how the global economic slowdown and the trade war are impacting U.S. companies,\u201d said Anselmo.

Modems are an indispensable part of phones and other mobile devices, connecting them to wireless data networks. Apple once used Qualcomm Inc chips exclusively but began phasing in Intel Corp chips in 2016 and dropped Qualcomm from iPhones released last year.  Johny Srouji, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of hardware technologies, took over the company\u2019s modem design efforts in January, the sources said. The organizational move has not been previously reported.  Srouji joined Apple in 2008 to lead chip design, including the custom A-series processors that power iPhones and iPads and a special Bluetooth chip that helps those devices pair with its AirPods wireless headphones and other Apple accessories.  The modem efforts had previously been led by Rub\u00e9n Caballero, who reports to Dan Riccio, the executive responsible for iPad, iPhone and Mac engineering, much of which involves integrating parts from the company\u2019s vast electronics supply chain.  Apple declined to comment. Technology publication The Information previously reported that Apple was working to develop its own modem chip.  The Cupertino, California-based company has posted job listings for modem engineers in San Diego, a hub for wireless design talent because of Qualcomm\u2019s longtime presence there and a place where Apple has said it plans to build up its workforce.  Apple\u2019s effort to make its own modem chips could take years, and it is impossible to know when, or in what devices, such chips might appear.  \u201cWhen you\u2019re Apple, everything has to be good,\u201d said Linley Gwennap, president of chip industry research firm The Linley Group. \u201cThere\u2019s no room for some substandard component in that phone.\u201d  5G ON HORIZON  Apple\u2019s investment in modem chips comes as carriers and other phone makers are rolling out devices for the next generation of faster wireless networks known as 5G.  Rival handset makers Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd already make their own modems.  Making its own modem chips would likely cost Apple hundreds of millions of dollars or more per year in development costs, analysts said, but could save it money eventually.  Modem chips are a major part of the cost of Apple devices, worth $15 to $20 each and likely costing Apple $3 billion to $4 billion for the 200 million or so iPhones it makes a year, said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.  Apple may also benefit by combining its modem chips with its processor chips, as Samsung, Huawei and most other phone makers do. That saves space and battery life, two important considerations if Apple introduces augmented reality features into future products.

Apple offers what are known as certificates that let businesses have deep controls over iPhones, with the potential to remotely install apps, monitor app usage and access, and delete data owned by a business on an iPhone. Apple designed the program for organizations whose staff use iPhones for official duties, when privacy needs are different from phones for personal use.  On Tuesday, technology news site TechCrunch reported that Facebook was paying users as young as 13 years old to install an app called Facebook Research. The app used Apple\u2019s business tools to ask for an iPhone user\u2019s permission to install so-called virtual private network software that can track browsing habits.  Apple ejected Facebook from the business app program, saying in a statement on Wednesday the program was \u201csolely for the internal distribution of apps within an organization.\u201d  \u201cFacebook has been using their membership to distribute a data-collecting app to consumers, which is a clear breach of their agreement with Apple,\u201d Apple said in the statement.  The ban does not affect Facebook\u2019s apps in Apple\u2019s App Store, which Facebook depends on to distribute Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram apps to iPhone users. But it does mean that Facebook will not be able to distribute internal apps to its own employees.

Cook wants to wean Apple off stagnating iPhone sales that make up over half its revenue and switch to generating income from services and wearables. Cook is implementing the strategy while also shepherding Apple through a trade dispute between two of its most important markets, the United States and China. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/34qdgDV)  Apple said it expects $85.5 billion to $89.5 billion in sales for its fiscal first quarter that ends in December, with a midpoint of $87.5 billion that is above analyst expectations of $86.9 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Apple shares rose about 2% to $247.50 in after-hours trading on the news.  In an interview with Reuters, Cook said he anticipated strong sales of services and wearables, as well \u201ca very, very good start\u201d for sales of the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max released last month. Cook said the forecast also reflects the company\u2019s belief that the United States and China will resolve their trade dispute.  \u201cI don\u2019t know every chapter of the book, but I think that will eventually happen,\u201d Cook told Reuters. \u201cI certainly hope it happens during the quarter, but we\u2019ll see about that.\u201d  The forecast comes as the Cupertino, California-based company said it generated $33.36 billion in iPhone sales for its fiscal fourth quarter ended in September, which compares with analyst expectations of $32.42 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  The results mark the fourth straight quarter of year-over-year declining iPhone sales. At the same time, hardware is getting less profitable on a gross margin basis, with Apple\u2019s net product sales falling while the cost of sales rose slightly.  But Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said part of Apple\u2019s rising stock price came from interest rate cuts by U.S. officials and other indicators of slowing economic growth. \u201cInvestors feel emboldened to pay up for what they feel is \u2018guaranteed growth\u2019 with big tech,\u201d Eddins said.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  In September, Apple unveiled a lineup that included the new iPhone 11 priced at $699, $50 lower than the debut price of its predecessor, the iPhone XR.  \u201cThe starting price of $699 is a factor in bringing more people into the market and giving people just another reason to upgrade,\u201d Cook told Reuters. \u201cIn China specifically ... we picked locally relevant price points that were more similar to the price points that had great success with earlier.\u201d  Apple\u2019s revenue is increasingly coming from accessories such as the Apple Watch and AirPods as well as new services such as its Apple Card credit card and a streaming television service set to begin on Friday. Customers will be able to buy iPhones using the Apple Card with no interest for 24 months, Cook said on the conference call.  Apple said its services and accessories segments generated $12.51 billion and $6.52 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, respectively, topping analyst estimates of $12.15 billion and $6 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  Apple now has 450 million subscribers to its own or third-party services on its devices, and sales of wearables were up 54% versus the previous year.  \u201cIt was an incredible quarter for wearables,\u201d Cook said. \u201cIt was a very broad range of services that set new all-time records, from our payment services to the search ad business to Apple Music, Apple Care, the App Store and cloud services - almost every kind of service we\u2019re in.\u201d  Apple sales for its Greater China region dropped a relatively modest 2.4% to $11.13 billion in Apple's fiscal fourth quarter ended in September.

Cook also said the company saw double-digit services revenue growth in China and wearables revenue in China grew at a higher rate than the companywide figure.  \u201cIPhone had a remarkable comeback from the way we performed earlier in the year,\u201d Cook said.  Apple\u2019s holiday-quarter forecast comes amid a trade conflict between the United States and China, where Apple assembles most of its products and where many of its suppliers are located. Tariffs on imports that would include Apple accessories took effect in September.  Tariffs might hit more categories of goods including Apple\u2019s iPhone on Dec. 15, though U.S. and Chinese negotiators were working on a deal.  Apple said its revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter was $64.04 billion, compared with analyst expectations of $62.99 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Earnings per share were $3.03 versus expectations of $2.84. On an absolute basis, earnings dropped from $14.13 billion to $13.69 billion, with the per-share results driven by a smaller base of outstanding shares due to repurchases.","1280":"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Thursday said he could not predict the success of Apple Inc\u2019s new suite of services but was confident the public would benefit as content providers vie for their wallets.

Apple warned earlier this month that holiday sales would miss Wall Street expectations due to weakness in emerging markets including India and foreign-exchange costs.  Shares in Foxconn and other Asian suppliers and assemblers for Apple fell on Tuesday after several component makers warned of weaker than expected results, leading some market watchers to call the peak for iPhones in several key markets.  Last week, Hon Hai reported that its October sales were up 21.5 percent year on year, the slowest year-on-year growth rate for any month since April.  Analysts said Apple changing the bottom cover of the iPhone 8 and iPhone X from metal to glass hurt profits at Foxconn, which had supplied the metal component.  Foxconn\u2019s gross margin this year is unlikely to return to the 7 percent it enjoyed in the 2015-2016 fiscal years due to weakening iPhone shipment growth and lower prices for metal casings, Fubon Research analyst Arthur Liao said in a research note ahead of the company\u2019s earnings.  Foxconn is a key assembler of the iPhone XR model, according to analysts, the cheapest of this year\u2019s new launches and a model that is likely seeing very little traction with customers.

It was not clear what Trump and Cook planned to discuss, and representatives for Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Representatives for the White House also did not immediately reply.  Apple and other hardware makers have deep ties with China, where they build most of their products for export around the world. Cook urged calm and called for more open trade after Trump announced he would impose tariffs on certain Chinese imports, and China retaliated with tariffs on U.S. imports.  Trump has a tense relationship with the U.S. technology industry, based in Democratic strongholds such as California\u2019s Silicon Valley and Seattle. He has clashed with the tech sector on a wide variety of issues including trade, immigration and the environment.  Cook, who attended Trump\u2019s first state dinner at the White House on Tuesday night, has publicly objected to the president\u2019s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, and criticized the U.S. president\u2019s comments after last year\u2019s violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.

The two-year Treasury yield briefly dropped below 2.4 percent to reach parity with the federal funds effective rate for the first time since 2008. The market move indicated that investors believe the Federal Reserve\u2019s plans to continue tightening monetary policy may be too aggressive given signs of an economic slowdown.  \u201cWhen the two-year yield is up, it\u2019s constructive for equities, because it\u2019s signaling that the economy is doing well, that the market can absorb the Fed moving toward rate normalization,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. \u201cThe two-year yield is telling you a different story now.\u201d  Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 31\/32 in price to yield 2.5517 percent, from 2.661 percent late on Wednesday.

Shortly afterward, Intel Corp said it will exit the smartphone modem chip business.  The entire drama played out as the mobile phone industry prepares to shift to a technology called 5G.  Echoing complaints from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Apple had alleged that Qualcomm used its patent licensing business to keep a monopoly on modem chips that connect devices like the iPhone to wireless data networks. Qualcomm insisted that Apple was using its valuable technology without proper payment, and Apple later dropped Qualcomm\u2019s chips in favor of those from Intel.  In the end, Apple and Qualcomm ceased all litigation, with Apple signing a six-year licensing deal with Qualcomm and also agreeing to buy Qualcomm chips. Hours later, Intel said it was getting out of the modem chip business.  WHAT IS 5G?  5G is a new network technology for wireless communications that could be up to 100 times faster than current 4G networks. The networks are coming on line in the United States, China, South Korea and other places this year, but probably will not be widespread until 2020. Modem chips connect devices like phones to these networks.  WHO ARE THE PLAYERS IN 5G?  Prior to Tuesday, five companies had disclosed 5G modem chips or plans to make them: Qualcomm, Intel, MediaTek Inc , Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Samsung and Huawei, however, only make chips for their own mobile phones.  WHY DOES APPLE CARE ABOUT 5G?  Some of Apple\u2019s rivals in the smartphone market - notably Samsung - plan to release 5G devices this year, which could put pressure on Apple to match the feature. Many carriers that are investing heavily to build 5G networks are also likely to put their marketing efforts behind 5G phones.  WILL APPLE HAVE A 5G PHONE THIS YEAR?  It would require an extraordinary effort from both companies. New modems take months of testing to ensure phones will work on carrier networks. Under traditional time lines, Apple would have needed to start testing a 5G iPhone last year, but its supplier Intel did not have a chip ready.  WILL APPLE LOSE MARKET SHARE WITHOUT A 5G PHONE?  Apple was slow to 4G too and did not pay a price. Samsung and others released 4G phones in 2011 as the networks were rolling out. Apple waited until 2012, when 4G networks become widely accessible. Many analysts believe Apple is making the same bet with 5G.  WHY DOES APPLE NEED QUALCOMM\u2019S CHIPS?  Apple\u2019s only current modem supplier, Intel, said that it would not have a 5G chip ready until 2020, which could have pushed Apple\u2019s launch of a 5G iPhone into 2021 - a long enough delay that it could hurt sales. Qualcomm, on the other hand, is preparing to ship its second generation 5G chip and can meet Apple\u2019s needs with its current products.  WILL APPLE EXCLUSIVELY USE QUALCOMM\u2019S CHIPS?  Not necessarily. While Apple and Qualcomm signed a supply agreement, Apple is working on developing its own modems and disclosed in court earlier this year that it has held talks with MediaTek and Samsung around modems.  WHY DID INTEL SHARE RISE AFTER IT EXITED THE MODEM BUSINESS?  Intel Chief Executive Bob Swan has told investors in the past that modem chips are not likely to fetch the same high margins as its CPU chips. Intel has plenty of other ways to make money from 5G, like selling CPUs to makers of base stations and so-called programmable chips to makers of networking gear.","1290":"SEOUL\/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Executives in Hyundai Motor Co Group are divided over a potential tie-up with Apple Inc, with some raising concerns about becoming a contract manufacturer for the U.S. tech giant, dimming the outlook for a deal.  FILE PHOTO: The Hyundai booth displays the company logo at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, U.S. January 16, 2018. REUTERS\/Jonathan Ernst  Hyundai said earlier this month it was in preliminary talks with Apple, but gave no details. Local media said the firms were discussing an electric car and battery tie-up.  Hyundai declined to comment for this story. Apple declined to comment.  Apple has never acknowledged talks with the automaker about building vehicles, and it was unclear whether any such talks are still active. The iPhone maker typically insists on strict secrecy from its potential partners and suppliers about future plans or unreleased products.  In an earnings call on Tuesday in which it reported its best quarterly profit in over three years, Hyundai did not give any updates on talks with Apple or indicate whether they remain active.  \u201cWe are agonizing over how to do it, whether it is good to do it or not,\u201d said a Hyundai executive aware of the internal discussions on the tie-up with Apple. \u201cWe are not a company which manufactures cars for others. It is not like working with Apple would always produce great results.\u201d  Few details are known about the talks between the two companies. But people close to the discussions say the options considered included Hyundai or Kia acting as a manufacturer for vehicles designed by Apple and sold under its powerful, ubiquitous brand.  Hyundai is traditionally known for its reluctance to work with outsiders, making engines, transmissions and even its own steel in-house under its vertically integrated supply chain as South Korea\u2019s second-largest conglomerate. Although shares in Kia and Hyundai have surged because of the talks, there is considerable opposition to becoming an Apple contract manufacturer, which could hold up any deal with the American giant, these people said.  Apple and Hyundai first started talks over a car partnership in 2018, when Apple\u2019s effort, known as \u201cProject Titan,\u201d was headed by Alexander Hitzinger, who is now a Volkswagen executive, said a person familiar with the matter. But progress was hampered by the South Korean automaker\u2019s reluctance to work with outsiders, the person said.  These talks have not been previously reported.  \u201cIt is really difficult (for Hyundai) to open up,\u201d this person said, adding that the South Korean company would likely to have to replace some executives to avoid a culture clash under any partnership with Apple.  \u201cApple is the boss. They do their marketing, they do their products, they do their brand. Hyundai is also the boss. That does not really work,\u201d the person said.  The South Korean car manufacturer, however, has excess capacity. Contract manufacturing would help it secure production volume.  NOT LIKE FOXCONN  Another person familiar with the matter said Apple would prefer to source major components of its own design - frames, bodies, drive trains, and other parts - from a variety of places and rely on Hyundai or Kia for a final assembly site.  \u201cThey would want this to be in the United States,\u201d the second person said.  While the talks are at an early stage, Hyundai Motor Group has \u201ctentatively decided\u201d that it would want Kia to partner with Apple, not Hyundai Motor, a Hyundai insider said.  \u201cThe Group is concerned that the Hyundai brand would become just Apple\u2019s contract manufacturer, which would not help Hyundai in its effort to build a more premium image with its Genesis brand,\u201d the insider said. Kia is also moving faster in terms of electric cars, and it has available production capacity at its Georgia factory in the United States.  Another executive at Hyundai said: \u201cTech firms like Google and Apple want us to be like (contract phone maker) Foxconn.  \u201cA cooperation may initially help raise the brand image of Hyundai or Kia. But in the mid- or longer-term, we will just provide shells for the cars, and Apple would do the brains.\u201d  Nevertheless, there are broad areas where the two companies could benefit, including access to Hyundai\u2019s electric car platform and its suppliers, such as battery makers, as well as access to Apple\u2019s autonomous vehicle stack and software, said Park Chul-wan, a South Korean battery expert and a professor at Seojeong University.  \u201cHyundai would be more than just a Foxconn,\u201d he said.","1291":"FILE PHOTO: An Apple company logo is seen behind tree branches outside an Apple store in Beijing, China December 14, 2018.

Apple said on Monday it would fix a flaw in its FaceTime chat software that allowed users to hear the audio of a person they were calling before that person answered the call.  The bug was discovered by 14-year-old Grant Thompson, who, along with his mother, Michele, tried to report the bug to Apple but said they struggled to get the company\u2019s attention until the problem gained traction on social media.  Apple turned off the FaceTime group chat feature on Monday as its engineers worked to fix the issue.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased to 963,000 for the week ended Aug. 8, the lowest level since mid-March but the expiration of a $600 weekly jobless supplement at the end of July likely contributed to the decline.  Data last week showed the economy has regained only 9.3 million jobs of the 22 million jobs lost between February and April, indicating that it faces a long road to reach pre-pandemic levels.

Chief Executive Tim Cook, who is in regular contact with U.S. President Donald Trump, told Reuters he sees some hope that trade tensions between the United States and China have eased, and that the company is considering pricing its phones in local currency in China and other international markets, which may spur sales.  Apple said it expects revenue between $55 billion and $59 billion for the current quarter ending in March, largely below analysts\u2019 average estimate of $58.83 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  For the quarter ending in December, Apple\u2019s busiest due to the holiday shopping season, Apple reported revenue of $84.3 billion, slightly above analysts\u2019 average estimate of $84 billion. Apple warned in early January that the quarter\u2019s sales would miss targets it gave in November.  Apple reported earnings per share of $4.18 for the December quarter, compared with Wall Street\u2019s average estimate of $4.17, according to Refinitiv data.  The company said revenue from services such as Apple Music, the App Store and others - which investors are counting on to fuel growth - reached $10.8 billion, in line with Wall Street estimates. Services gross margin hit 63 percent.  The company said it now has 360 million subscribers to both its own and third party services, and set a goal to expand that to 500 million by the end of 2020. It said it now has 1.4 billion active devices, an increase of 100 million from last year, and that 900 million of those are iPhones.  Apple\u2019s iPhone revenue declined 15 percent year over year to $51.9 billion. Cook said China\u2019s economic weakness hurt iPhone sales there.  He said Apple is rethinking how it prices the iPhone outside the United States after largely setting the price in U.S. dollars, which made the phones more expensive in local currencies.  \u201cWhen you look at foreign currencies and then particularly those markets that weakened over the last year those (iPhone price) increases were obviously more,\u201d Cook told Reuters. \u201cAnd so as we\u2019ve gotten into January and assessed the macroeconomic condition in some of those markets we\u2019ve decided to go back to more commensurate with what our local prices were a year ago in hopes of helping the sales in those areas.\u201d  Cook said he was optimistic that the United States and China can resolve trade tensions that have weighed on the Chinese economy and that the situation seemed to improve this month.  \u201cAs we\u2019ve gotten down in to January, January looks better than December looked. And I think if you were to graph up trade tension it\u2019s clearly less in January than it was in December,\u201d Cook told Reuters. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that the two countries will be able to work things out.\u201d (Reporting by Stephen Nellis Editing by Bill Rigby)","1294":"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear a due-process challenge to the one-line summary affirmances used by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, letting stand a win for Apple Inc and Cisco Systems in a patent-infringement case by SPIP Litigation Group, formerly known as Straight Path IP.

The company told Reuters it was aiming to protect all customers, especially in countries where phones are readily obtained by police or by criminals with extensive resources, and to head off further spread of the attack technique.  The privacy standard-bearer of the tech industry said it will change default settings in the iPhone operating system to cut off communication through the USB port when the phone has not been unlocked in the past hour.  That port is how machines made by forensic companies GrayShift, Cellebrite and others connect and get around the security provisions that limit how many password guesses can be made before the device freezes them out or erases data. Now they will be unable to run code on the devices after the hour is up.  These companies have marketed their machines to law enforcement in multiple countries this year, offering the machines themselves for thousands of dollars but also per-phone pricing as low as $50.  Apple representatives said the change in settings will protect customers in countries where law enforcement seizes and tries to crack phones with fewer legal restrictions than under U.S. law. They also noted that criminals, spies and unscrupulous people often use the same techniques. Even some of the methods most prized by intelligence agencies have been leaked on the internet.  \u201cWe\u2019re constantly strengthening the security protections in every Apple product to help customers defend against hackers, identity thieves and intrusions into their personal data,\u201d Apple said in a prepared statement. \u201cWe have the greatest respect for law enforcement, and we don\u2019t design our security improvements to frustrate their efforts to do their jobs.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: A customer views the new iPhone 7 smartphone inside an Apple Inc. store in Los Angeles, California, U.S., September 16, 2016. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  Apple began working on the USB issue before learning it was a favorite of law enforcement.  The setting switch had been documented in beta versions of iOS 11.4.1 and iOS12, and Apple told Reuters it will be made permanent in a forthcoming general release.  Apple said that after it learned of the techniques, it reviewed the iPhone operating system code and improved security. It decided to simply alter the setting, a cruder way of preventing most of the potential access by unfriendly parties.  With the changes, police or hackers will typically have an hour or less to get a phone to a cracking machine. That could cut access by as much as 90 percent, security researchers estimated.  This also could spur sales of cracking devices, as law enforcement looks to get more forensic machines closer to where seizures occur. Undoubtedly, researchers and police vendors will find new ways to break into phones, and Apple will then look to patch those vulnerabilities.  The setting change could also draw criticism from U.S. law enforcement officials who have been engaged in an on-again, off-again campaign for legislation or other ways to force technology companies to maintain access to users\u2019 communications.  Apple has been the most prominent opponent of those demands. In 2016, it went to court to fight an order that it break into an iPhone 5c used by a killer in San Bernardino.  Then-FBI Director James Comey told Congress that without compelling Apple to write new software to facilitate the digital break-in, there would be no way to learn if the shooter\u2019s device contained evidence of a conspiracy. The FBI ultimately found a contractor that broke into the phone without Apple\u2019s cooperation.  Apple and most private security experts argue that government contractors and others can usually find means of cracking devices. They also say that weakening encryption by design would lead to more hacking by those outside of government.  Until recently, current FBI Director Christopher Wray repeatedly claimed that the Bureau had been unable to get into more than 7,000 phones in 2017.

Telecom companies across the world have been ramping up their efforts to build high-speed next-generation 5G network, driving up demand for optical fiber.  Net sales from Corning\u2019s optical communications division surged 26 percent to $1.17 billion in the fourth quarter, as the company secured more contracts from companies upgrading their networks. The division is on track to surpass its 2020 sales goal of $5 billion, Corning said.  Corning\u2019s net sales from its specialty materials unit, which makes Gorilla Glass used in smartphones, tablets and notebook PCs, rose just 2 percent to $399 million after several quarters of rapid growth.  Smartphone makers Apple and Samsung have warned investors about weakening demand from China, with several mobile component suppliers following their suit.  Corning reported net income of $292 million, or 32 cents per share, compared with a loss of $1.41 billion, or $1.66 per share, a year earlier.  Net sales rose to $3.04 billion from $2.64 billion.

Trump\u2019s meeting with Cook was disclosed by daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump during an event that Trump held with governors on skills development.  Cook is a frequent visitor to the White House and has worked with Ivanka Trump on her job training and education initiatives. The president often name-checks Cook as a business leader who has brought jobs and investment back to the United States.  On Thursday, Trump spoke with Cook about \u201ctrade, U.S. investment, immigration and privacy,\u201d White House spokesman Judd Deere said. A spokesperson for Apple could not be immediately reached for comment.  The meeting comes as Trump weighs whether to go ahead with proposed increases to tariffs in his trade war with China. He has said he will make a decision some time after the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan at the end of June, where he hopes to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping.  Trump is using tariffs to push Xi to change a host of Chinese trade practices, but negotiations have flagged. Makers of consumer electronics like phones and tablets have escaped the brunt of tariffs to this point but likely would be affected by the next hike.  U.S. authorities are also preparing to probe market power of large technology companies, according to sources. Cook has defended his company, saying it has a moderate share of the market and is not too large.","1304":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc's AAPL.O news service has reached 100 million monthly active users and customers spent more than $1.4 billion in the App Store between Christmas and New Year, the latest signs of growing revenue from the iPhone maker's services business.

On Sunday, in a stock market filing, the company said it had been informed of two notices issued by the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) regarding a Section 337 investigation filed against it by U.S.-based Amphenol Corp, alleging IP infringement.  Luxshare said it had hired a team of lawyers to respond and would \u201cfollow procedure\u201d on the investigation, without elaborating, but re-iterated that the case \u201cwill not have a material impact\u201d on its current operations and production.  Amphenol filed a section 337 complaint against Luxshare and its subsidiaries in December, alleging that certain electric components imported into the United States from Luxshare infringe on Amphenol\u2019s patents for connector cables.  Days later, Luxshare issued a statement saying it had learned of the complaint via USITC\u2019s website, and added it had established an internal working group to investigate the claims.  Founded in 2004, Luxshare has in recent years become a fast-rising supplier for Apple. It has steadily moved up the hardware giant\u2019s value chain, from making connector cables for the iPhone and Macbook to manufacturing Airpods.  Last year the company acquired two iPhone assembly plant from Taiwan-based Wistron Corp.  That move unnerved some executives at Foxconn, the dominant maker of the handsets, and is seen by analysts as a sign of more indigenous Chinese companies making deeper inroads into Apple\u2019s supply chain.","1312":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc\u2019s new iPhones will use recycled rare earth elements in a key component, the company said on Wednesday.  FILE PHOTO: Apple company logos are reflected on the glass window outside an Apple store in Shanghai, China January 3, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song  Apple said it will use recycled rare earths in its \u201cTaptic Engine,\u201d a part that lets iPhones mimic a physical button click despite being a flat pane of glass. The part is about one-quarter of the rare earth elements inside the iPhone models.  Rare earths, a group of 17 specialized minerals, have become a flash point in trade tensions between the United States and China. The elements are used in weapons, consumer electronics and other goods.  China dominates the processing of the raw minerals, and has implied through its state-controlled media that it could restrict rare earths sales to the United States, just as it did to Japan after a diplomatic dispute in 2010.  Lisa Jackson, Apple\u2019s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, said Apple\u2019s use of recycled rare earths was \u201cnot related\u201d to trade tensions but could help it maintain a steady supply.  \u201cThis is one of those happy coincidences where what is good for the planet is really good for business at the same time,\u201d Jackson told Reuters. \u201cOne of the things we talk about a lot internally, just in general, is how much more resilient this makes our supply chain.\u201d  In consumer electronics, rare earths reside in tiny speakers and actuators. The parts are so small that collecting them for recycling is difficult and expensive.  For now, Apple will use recycled rare earths from an outside supplier, not from previously used iPhones. Apple declined to name the supplier or say what products the rare earths were recovered from, though the company did say the source was post-industrial, meaning material generated during manufacturing processes rather than from discarded consumer products.  Jackson said that Apple\u2019s scale - new iPhone models are typically sell tens of millions of units per year - helped make the project economically viable.  \u201cWe have essentially made a market for this entrepreneur, this innovator, who found a way to recycle rare earths,\u201d Jackson said.  Kyle Wiens, the chief executive of iFixit, a company focused on repairing and reusing electronics, said Apple\u2019s move was a first for the industry.  \u201cRare earth elements aren\u2019t being recycled from electronics right now, and that\u2019s a huge problem \u2014 China has a stranglehold on the virgin material supply,\u201d Wiens said. \u201cThis is a great idea \u2014 Apple could single-handedly create a hugely needed market for recycled rare earths.\u201d  Apple often aims to reuse parts from its old devices.  Apple said on Wednesday that aluminum from enclosures recovered through its trade-in programs will be melted down and made into new MacBook Air laptop computers. The company previously disclosed that cobalt recovered from iPhone batteries disassembled by robots at its recycling labs in Texas is put into new iPhone batteries.  Apple is experimenting with ways to recover rare earths from its phones using its robots, which can remove tiny parts and separate them into collection bins to aggregate enough material to make recycling viable.  The company is also researching ways that conventional recyclers, who shred devices and separate out the various materials, could tweak their lines to recover the elements, information that Jackson said Apple is open to sharing.  \u201cThere are some innovations of ours that we actually want people to copy. So as much as possible - as long as it doesn\u2019t give away some of our other design and engineering innovation - we are happy to bring along the recycling industry,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe have started to be much more transparent around this technology development than we usually are.\u201d","1313":"(Adds context on previous attempt at AirPods tariff)  SAN FRANCISCO\/WASHINGTON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Apple Inc\u2019s AirPods, Apple Watch and HomePod, which have helped the company offset waning sales of its bestselling iPhone this year, are not included in a temporary reprieve on tariffs by the Trump administration and will face a 10% levy on Sept 1.  The administration said on Tuesday that some major items, such as laptops and cellphones, including Apple\u2019s MacBooks and iPhones, will not face tariffs until Dec. 15. President Donald Trump said the change was to avoid an impact on U.S. customers during the Christmas shopping season. The tariff delay that affects some of Apple\u2019s biggest-selling products helped send its shares up more than 4% in late trading.  Trump and his administration did not say why some electronics received a reprieve and others did not. Many of the products set to face tariffs on Sept. 1, such as smart watches, fitness trackers, smart speakers and Bluetooth headphones, had been spared once before.  These include popular products from Apple rivals, such as Fitbit smart watches and smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google. The Trump administration had proposed tariffs on those devices to take effect last September, but they were spared at the last moment after Apple, among other companies, told the government that the levies would \u201cresult in lower U.S. growth and competitiveness and higher prices for U.S. consumers.\u201d  Some accessories have been central to Apple\u2019s efforts to diversify revenue beyond its signature iPhone, which pushed the company\u2019s market capitalization past $1 trillion in 2018 though the market cap has slipped this year.  In Apple\u2019s latest reported fiscal quarter, the iPhone contributed less than half of company revenues for the first time in seven years. The iPhone\u2019s decline was somewhat offset by a 50% jump in sales of so-called wearables, such as the Apple Watch and AirPods, helping Apple beat Wall Street estimates and boosting its stock.  Apple does not break out by geographic region the sales of products such as wearables.  \u201cWe\u2019ve really put large strategic investments and resources and interest into wearables and services,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told Reuters on July 30. \u201cAnd if you take those two and add them together, they\u2019re now the size of a Fortune 50 company, and they were essentially nascent businesses not that long ago.\u201d  Apple, Fitbit, Amazon and Google did not immediately return requests for comment.

Spotify, which launched a year after the 2007 launch of the iPhone, said on Wednesday that Apple\u2019s control of its App store deprived consumers of choice and rival providers of audio streaming services to the benefit of Apple Music, which began in 2015.  Central to Spotify\u2019s complaint, filed to the European Commission on Monday, is what it says is a 30 percent fee Apple charges content-based service providers to use Apple\u2019s in-app purchase system (IAP).  Horacio Gutierrez, Spotify\u2019s general counsel, said the company was pressured into using the billing system in 2014, but then was forced to raise the monthly fee of its premium service from 9.99 to 12.99 euros, just as Apple Music launched at Spotify\u2019s initial 9.99 price.  Spotify then ceased use of Apple\u2019s IAP system, meaning Spotify customers could only upgrade to the fee-based package indirectly, such as on a laptop.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Under App store rules, Spotify said, content-based apps could not include buttons or external links to pages with production information, discounts or promotions and faced difficulties fixing bugs. Such restrictions do not apply to Android phones, it said.  \u201cPromotions are essential to our business. This is how we convert our free customers to premium,\u201d Gutierrez said.  Voice recognition system Siri would not hook iPhone users up to Spotify and Apple declined to let Spotify launch an app on its Apple Watch, Spotify said.  Spotify declined to say what economic damage it believed it had suffered.  \u201cWe feel confident in the economic analysis we have submitted to the Commission that we could have done better than we have done so far,\u201d Gutierrez said.","1315":"(Reuters) - Wall Street rallied on Friday, led higher by Apple and Microsoft as investors finished a turbulent week of trading and some states prepared to relax coronavirus-related lockdowns.

FILE PHOTO: Japan Display Inc's logo is pictured at its headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, August 9, 2016. REUTERS\/Kim Kyung-Hoon\/File Photo  The rescue comes after previous, publicly funded bailouts failed to help the company cut its dependence on Apple, whose slowing iPhone sales have badly hit Japan Display.  The deal will make the buyers Japan Display\u2019s biggest shareholders - with a 49.8 percent stake - replacing the Japanese government-backed INCJ fund and effectively ending the government\u2019s efforts to keep the last remaining domestic display maker out of foreign hands.  The buyer group, which includes Taiwanese flat screen maker TPK Holding and Chinese investment firm Harvest Group, will inject up to 80 billion yen into Japan Display by buying shares and bonds.  INCJ will also join the bailout by accepting a debt-to-preferred equity swap totaling 75 billion yen and extending senior loans worth 77 billion yen. After the deal its stake will fall to 12.7 percent from 25.3 percent.  The deal could potentially be subject to a U.S. national security review at a time when Washington is stepping up its scrutiny on Chinese investment in the United States.  Japan Display has a subsidiary in San Jose, a U.S. business that could give the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) jurisdiction over the deal.  Displays may not necessarily be critical technologies that are export controlled, but some of Japan Display\u2019s technologies such as fingerprint sensors could raise a national security concern, said Nancy Fischer and Matthew Rabinowitz, partner and senior associate, respectively, at U.S.-based law firm Pillsbury.  Minoru Kikuoka, Japan Display\u2019s finance division head, told reporters at a briefing that the company\u2019s legal advisors have said a CFIUS filing would not be necessary. CFIUS, however, retains indefinite jurisdiction to request a filing and review the transaction, even after it closes.  NEW BEGINNINGS  The bailout comes as sales of new iPhone models - many of which use newer organic light-emitting displays (OLED) - have left Japan Display\u2019s new factory that makes liquid crystal display (LCD) panels running at half capacity.  Japan Display expects to post its fifth straight year of net losses in the year ending this month, as disappointing sales of Apple\u2019s iPhone XR, the only model with an LCD screen, dashed hopes for a turnaround.  The Apple business accounted for more than half of Japan Display\u2019s revenue over the last four years.  Kikuoka said at the briefing, without naming Apple, that Japan Display still owes its client about 100 billion yen. The U.S. tech giant fronted most of the $1.5 billion construction costs for a new LCD factory three years ago.  \u201cWe discussed with our client, including that (repayment) issue as well, before we reached the agreement,\u201d Kikuoka said.  Under the latest deal, Japan Display and Harvest Tech, part of the buyout group, are planning to jointly produce OLED panels, used in top-end iPhones, Japan Display said.  Reuters reported earlier this month that Japan Display will begin supplying OLED screens for the Apple Watch later this year.  Japan Display was formed in 2012 by combining the LCD businesses of Hitachi Ltd, Toshiba Corp and Sony Corp in a deal brokered by the government.  It went public in March 2014 and was worth more than 400 billion yen then. It is now worth 67 billion yen.","1317":"Aug 28 (Reuters) - Apple Inc said on Friday it had terminated \u201cFortnite\u201d creator Epic Games\u2019 account on its app store, following a legal battle between the two over the iPhone maker\u2019s in-app payment guidelines.

It was the kind of technical digression that, in years past, might have been reserved for design chief Jony Ive\u2019s narration of a precision aluminum milling process to produce the iPhone\u2019s clean lines. But in this case, Schiller, the company\u2019s most enthusiastic photographer, was heaping his highest praise on custom silicon and artificial intelligence software.  The technology industry\u2019s battleground for smartphone cameras has moved inside the phone, where sophisticated artificial intelligence software and special chips play a major role in how a phone\u2019s photos look.  \u201cCameras and displays sell phones,\u201d said Julie Ask, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester.  Apple added a third lens to the iPhone 11 Pro model, matching the three-camera setup of rivals like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], already a feature on their flagship models.  But Apple also played catch-up inside the phone, with some features such as \"night mode,\" a setting designed to make low-light photos look better. Apple will add that mode to its new phones when they ship on Sept. 20, but Huawei and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google Pixel have had similar features since last year.  In making photos look better, Apple is trying to gain an advantage by way of the custom chip that powers its phone. During the iPhone 11 Pro launch, executives spent more time talking its processor - dubbed the A13 Bionic - than the specs of the newly added lens.  A special portion of that chip called the \u201cneural engine,\u201d which is reserved for artificial intelligence tasks, aims to help the iPhone take better, sharper pictures in challenging lighting situations.  Samsung and Huawei also design custom chips for their phones, and even Google has custom \u201cVisual Core\u201d silicon that helps with its Pixel\u2019s photography tasks.  Ryan Reith, the program vice president for research firm IDC\u2019s mobile device tracking program, said that has created an expensive game in which only phone makers with enough resources to create custom chips and software can afford to invest in custom camera systems that set their devices apart.  Even very cheap handsets now feature two and three cameras on the back of the phone, he said, but it is the chips and software that play a huge role in whether the resulting images look stunning or so-so.  \u201cOwning the stack today in smartphones and chipsets is more important than it\u2019s ever been, because the outside of the phone is commodities,\u201d Reith said.  The custom chips and software powering the new camera system take years to develop. But in Apple\u2019s case, the research and development work could prove useful later in products such as augmented reality glasses, which many industry experts believe Apple has under development.  \u201cIt\u2019s all being built up for the bigger story down the line - augmented reality, starting in phones and eventually other products,\u201d Reith said.","1319":"* Apple jumps on results as services business grows  * Boeing gains after upbeat earnings, 2019 deliveries forecast  * U.S. private sector jobs additions more-than-expected in Jan  * Fed meeting, U.S.-trade talks eyed  * Futures up: Dow 0.88 pct, S&P 0.43 pct, Nasdaq 0.90 pct (Adds comment, details, updates prices)  Jan 30 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set for a strong open on Wednesday as results from Apple Inc and Boeing Co calmed nerves ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s update on monetary policy and fresh U.S.-China trade talks.

Both the rivals have deeper libraries and years of experience in making hit shows, but have taken varying approaches to how they release content.  Netflix last year started debuting original films like \u201cRoma\u201d, \u201cBird Box\u201d and \u201cThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs\u201d for limited runs in theaters, before bringing them on to the streaming service.

A lawyer provisionally appointed to represent Zhang did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. Zhang\u2019s arraignment is set for July 27 and he has not yet entered a plea.  But the complaint also for the first time gave an official account of some details of the self-driving car program. About 5,000 employees were authorized to access information about the program, including about 2,700 \u201ccore\u201d employees with access to secret databases.  It also said Zhang was shown a \u201cproprietary chip\u201d by his co-workers and designed circuit boards to analyze sensor data, suggesting Apple may be designing its own chips for self-driving systems and working on technologies such as \u201csensor fusion,\u201d in which data from multiple sensors is combined to make it more accurate.  The technical detail in the complaint \u201cwould only have been possible if Apple complied\u201d with investigators, said Bryant Walker Smith, an assistant professor of law at the University of South Carolina who has studied issues around autonomous vehicles. Given the fact that even more technical details could come out at trial, \u201cthat\u2019s striking in its own right\u201d and shows the importance Apple places on protecting its technology, he said.  Apple has kept tight wraps on its ambitions for self-driving cars, declining to acknowledge them at all publicly until it wrote a letter to U.S. transportation regulators in late 2016 urging them not to restrict testing of the vehicles. And then last year, Apple secured a permit to test autonomous vehicles in California.  But aside from filing a mandatory government training plan for the permitted Lexus model RX450h vehicles that outlined how drivers could take back manual control of the car, Apple has given few clues which aspects of the technology it\u2019s working on. Last year, Apple researchers published their first public research on cars, a software system that could help spot pedestrians more readily.  Apple did not immediately return a request for comment on the technical aspects of the complaint.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  That means that Apple will order 30 percent fewer of the chips from Dialog this year than it had initially expected, Dialog said in a statement on Thursday.  The news sent its shares 3.9 percent lower in late Frankfurt trade. Dialog\u2019s stock has lost more than half of its value over the past year on investor concerns that Apple is working on its own battery-saving chips for iPhones.  Analysts reckon Dialog derives more than half its revenue from supplying Apple with PMICs.  The reduced order volume for the PMICs will shave 5 percent off the chipmaker\u2019s 2018 revenues, but Dialog said it still expected its 2018 revenues to grow year-on-year.  The impact on 2019 revenues is likely to be similar, Chief Executive Jalal Bagherli told analysts on a conference call.  He said Apple had not provided a reason for the change in its sourcing of chips.  \u201cIf you think about the fact that we are qualified for all three phones, that means there is no performance-related issue. It might be a statement of intent to reduce risk on having one supplier and have an alternative source,\u201d he said.  He also said Apple had not told him who the second, new supplier of the main PMICs was but said he saw it as very likely that it was an in-house source at Apple.  Apple did not change the projected order volume for the other power management chip that Dialog is supplying for the new iPhone models - the sub-PMIC - nor for all other PMICs, including those for tablets, wearables and notebooks.  Dialog said it would continue to explore new mixed-signal opportunities outside of power management for future Apple products.","1331":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O unveils its streaming entertainment service, Apple TV+, in more than 100 markets on Friday.

FILE PHOTO: CEO Tim Cook presents the new iPhone 11 at an Apple event at their headquarters in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 10, 2019. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam\/File Photo  The iPhone 11, launched on Tuesday for $50 less than last year's base XR model, was met with a limp response from social media users in Asian markets that are dominated by Huawei Technologies and Samsung Electronics 005930.KS.  Lowering the entry price point, a rare move from Apple, was likely an effort to attract buyers in China, where Apple has ceded ground to Huawei due to a surge in support from patriotic Chinese consumers after the Chinese brand was caught in the U.S.-China trade standoff, said analysts.  Despite the reduction, the iPhone 11, and even the higher-end models with more camera lenses, are set to come up short in Asia.  \u201cApple\u2019s new phones were no surprise at all. Only tangible change is having an additional camera on their premium model,\u201d said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Seoul-based Cape Investment & Securities.  \u201cHowever, it is noticeable that Apple has made a price cut for the newest iPhone for about $50, which is a very rare move for the company. The move might be aiming to manage and reduce potential risks drawn by the U.S.-China trade war.\u201d  The iPhone 11 will have two back cameras and is priced starting at $699, down from $749 for the XR last year. On Tuesday, Apple also dropped the price of the XR by $150.  The more expensive iPhone 11 Pro will have three cameras on the back and starts at $999. The bigger screen iPhone 11 Pro Max starts at $1,099.  (Graphic: Apple unveils new iPhones - )  \u201cSince we still have to wait a year for 5G, why not just buy Huawei on Monday,\u201d said one user on China\u2019s Twitter-like service Weibo. Huawei and smaller rival Vivo have already released 5G models in China, and Samsung in South Korea.  A meme doing the rounds on Chinese social media featured Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook bragging about the new features and Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei\u2019s consumer business group, shutting him down by pointing out that Huawei has had those features for years.  \u201c(Apple) just added one more camera lens and called it a new feature, meanwhile it is still too pricey,\u201d said a user on South Korea\u2019s Naver.com web portal.  One of the main draws of the new launch for U.S. buyers - a $5 per month Netflix-like streaming service - will not be available in China.  FEATURES VS PRICE  Counterpoint analyst Neil Shah said the entry price, while lowered by Apple, remains high compared to local rivals. Combined with the lack of 5G, that made the new iPhones \u201cless attractive and future-proof\u201d for Chinese consumers, Shah said, forecasting that Apple will sell 30-35 million iPhones in China this year, down from 63 million phones in 2015.  Apple\u2019s share of the China market in the June quarter fell to 5.8% from 6.4% in the year earlier period, according to research firm Canalys. It has also lost ground in South Korea, with market share dropping to 11.2% from 12.5%, according to research firm Strategy Analytics.  In India, a market that Apple has said is key for growth, reaction to the new phones was muted as well.  \u201cI don\u2019t believe customers will buy more iPhones now because the new models sport more cameras, it will not move the needle much for them,\u201d said Navkendar Singh, research director at IDC India.  Customers in India who care more about owning Apple-branded phones over the latest model are now likely to buy the discounted XR instead, Singh said.  Still, some analysts said that Apple\u2019s decision to lower the entry price for the new iPhone, one of the most discussed topics on Weibo on Wednesday, was a positive sign.  \u201cWe think the lower iPhone 11 price point and trade-in program will help promote upgrades, specifically in China, while the Apple Arcade and TV+ offerings will help accelerate services growth,\u201d CFRA analyst Angelo Zino said in a research note.  The new phones will be available to order on Friday and start shipping Sept. 20.","1335":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O on Monday said it will switch to its own chips for its Mac computers, saying the first machines will ship this year and ending a nearly 15-year reliance on Intel Corp to supply processors for its flagship laptops and desktop.  Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said it marked the beginning of a major new era for a product line that powered the company\u2019s rise in the 1980s and its resurgence in the late 1990s.  \u201cSilicon is at the heart of our hardware,\u201d Cook said during a virtual keynote address recorded at the company\u2019s Cupertino, California headquarters for its annual developer conference. \u201cHaving a world class silicon design team is a game changer.\u201d  The silicon switch brings the Mac into line with the company\u2019s iPhone and iPads, which already use Apple-designed chips. Cook said that Apple expects the Mac transition to take about two years and that Apple still has some Intel-based computers in its pipeline that it will support for \u201cmany years.\u201d  But the move will give software developers for Apple\u2019s largest pool of third-party apps - those built for iPhones and iPads - new access to its laptops and desktop for the first time. Apple software chief Craig Federighi said that for those offerings, \u201cmost apps will just work, with no changes from the developer\u201d on the new Macs. He also said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of existing apps for Intel-based machines can be modified to work in \u201cjust a few days.\u201d  But analysts said Intel would likely to continue to supply Apple with data center chips that power services such as iCloud. In a statement, Intel said Apple remained a customer \u201cacross several areas of business\u201d and that it was still focused on the PC market.  \u201cWe believe Intel-powered PCs \u2014 like those based on our forthcoming Tiger Lake mobile platform \u2014 provide global customers the best experience in the areas they value most, as well as the most open platform for developers, both today and into the future,\u201d Intel said.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, said Apple\u2019s two-year window at moving to its own chips was likely aimed at holding on to Mac sales to corporations, where Apple has double-digit market share.  \u201cThere are just standards there (in corporate software) that run on x86\u201d chips from Intel, he said. Apple \u201ccannot abandon that as quickly as they want if they want to maintain the enterprise and commercial share for Mac, which is one of their major segments.\u201d  As with previous Macs, the new Apple-chipped machines will remain able to download software from outside Apple\u2019s official app stores, in contrast to iPhones and iPads, which for the most part can only run software from Apple\u2019s stores.  Apple shares gained 2.7% to a record high, helping the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC to a record close of its own.  FOCUS ON THE APP STORE  Apple announced the moves at its Worldwide Developer Conference. The conference has gained new prominence since paid services sold through the App Store have become central to the company\u2019s revenue growth as consumers have slowed the growth of iPhone upgrades. Apple takes a 15% to 30% cut of the sales developers make through the App Store, which is the only way to distribute software onto Apple\u2019s mobile devices.  Those fees, and Apple\u2019s strict app review process, have come under antitrust scrutiny in the United States and Europe, where regulators last week unveiled a formal probe into the company. In what appeared to be an acknowledgement of some critics, Apple said it would let users select non-Apple apps as default apps for tasks like email and web browsing on iPhones and iPads.  Apple this year added privacy protections, saying it would let users only share their approximate location with app developers and would require those developers to seek permission before sharing user data with other apps and websites. Apple also said it would require a privacy and security label, akin to a food nutrition label, to be shown to users before they download apps.","1336":"Feb 26 (Reuters) - Apple Inc is preparing to release three new smartphones later this year, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the products.

FILE PHOTO: A salesman checks a customer's iPhone at a mobile phone store in New Delhi, India, July 27, 2016. REUTERS\/Adnan Abidi  Foxconn 2317.TW, Wistron 3231.TW and Pegatron 4938.TW all plan to make investments under the scheme, said the sources, who asked not to be named as the discussions are private.  India\u2019s new $6.65 billion production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme offers companies cash incentives on any increase in sales of locally-made smartphones over the next five years, compared with 2019-20 levels. The scheme aims to help transform India into an export manufacturing hub.  Foxconn has applied to invest about 40 billion rupees ($542 million), while Wistron and Pegatron have committed to invest close to 13 billion rupees and 12 billion rupees, respectively, under the PLI plan, the sources said.  It is unclear whether all of the investment will be targeted at boosting manufacturing of Apple devices in India, but the sources and industry insiders said the vast majority would be focused on expanding iPhone manufacturing in the country.  Foxconn said that as a matter of policy it did not comment on specific operations or work for any customer. Apple, Wistron, Pegatron and India\u2019s technology ministry, which formulated the PLI scheme, did not respond to emails seeking comment.  While Foxconn, Pegatron and Wistron make devices for companies other than Apple globally, Wistron\u2019s arm in India currently assembles only iPhones.  Wistron, which assembles roughly 200,000 second-generation iPhone SEs per month in India, plans to scale that up to 400,000 a month by the end of the year, one of the sources said, as it looks to cater to export demand for the device.  That plan is expected to create roughly 10,000 jobs, the source added.  Pegatron is yet to start Indian operations, but has been in talks with several states, with Tamil Nadu in the south emerging as a frontrunner for a planned plant to manufacture Apple devices, a third source said.  Foxconn, which also assembles devices for Xiaomi 1810.HK in India, already has enough capacity to meet Xiaomi's needs and is likely to use the PLI plan largely to boost iPhone production, a fourth source said.  The commitments would help Apple diversify its supply chain beyond China, which is locked in a trade war with the United States.  Apple started assembling in 2017 a low-cost iPhone model in India through Wistron\u2019s local unit in the tech hub of Bengaluru. It later ramped up production, with Foxconn beginning to assemble iPhones last year and Wistron widening operations.  \u201cIndia is key to Apple\u2019s global ambitions as it expands beyond China,\u201d said Tarun Pathak, an associate director at tech researcher Counterpoint. \u201cIt offers a strategic market to them where skilled labour is cheaper as compared to other manufacturing destinations, the size of the internal market is huge and the export potential is enormous.\u201d  Local manufacturing helps Apple save costly duties levied on imports of fully-built phones and components in India, where the Cupertino, California-headquartered tech giant accounts for just 1% of smartphone shipments.  Apple is looking to change that. It launched its online store in India last week, and is building its first company-run retail store in the financial hub of Mumbai.","1349":"March 13 (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Friday called off the in-person portion of its annual developers conference scheduled to be held in San Jose and said it would run the program entirely online in June because of coronavirus fears.

Since 2012 Apple says it has reduced the number of underage workers in its extended supply chain, which includes locations where rare earth minerals are mined for use in smartphones.  Labour rights groups had previously criticised Apple and its biggest manufacturing partner Foxconn for excessive overtime, hiring underage workers and failing to provide health insurance.  \u201cOne of the deepest commitments that Apple has a company is to leave the world better than we found it,\u201d Angela Ahrendts, head of retail at Apple, said during Trust Conference in London, which is hosted by the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  \u201cAs a company whose work touches the lives of so many people, we feel we have an enormous responsibility, and an enormous opportunity, to turn our values into action,\u201d she said, receiving the prize designed by British sculptor Anish Kapoor.  The Thomson Reuters Foundation Stop Slavery Award recognises efforts by companies to identify, investigate and eradicate forced labour from their supply chains.  Consumer goods giant Unilever was the other winner of the annual award, while financial services firm Standard Chartered and Thailand-based seafood producer Thai Union were highly commended for their work.  More than 40 million people are estimated to be trapped as slaves in forced labour and forced marriages, most of them women and girls, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO) and rights group Walk Free Foundation.  Nearly 25 million work in factories, on construction sites, farms, fishing boats and as domestic or sex workers, says ILO.  With slavery now considered a major global issue, there is growing scrutiny on initiatives to meet a U.N. goal to end by 2030 a trade estimated to raise annual illicit gains of $150 billion for traffickers.  Businesses are under increased pressure from both governments and consumers to disclose what actions they are taking to ensure their supply chains are free from slavery.  The world\u2019s largest canned tuna company, Thai Union Group PCL, has also pledged to tackle potential labour abuse and overfishing, seeking to clean up the Thai seafood industry.  Thailand\u2019s multibillion-dollar seafood sector has come under fire in recent years after investigations showed widespread slavery, trafficking and violence on fishing boats and in onshore food processing factories.  The company said in 2016 it would eliminate recruitment fees for its workers to prevent labourers from racking up debts to job brokers and from being exploited and abused.  The Stop Slavery Award was won last year by sports giant German sportswear giant Adidas, global fashion retailer C&A, U.S. technology company Intel, and British retail and services group The Co-operative Group.","1352":"HONG KONG (Reuters) - China\u2019s Huawei Technologies said on Tuesday it has not held talks with Apple Inc about supplying 5G chipsets, a day after its founder said it was open to selling such chips to the U.S. firm which has yet to unveil dates for a next-gen iPhone.  FILE PHOTO: A Huawei logo is pictured during the media day for the Shanghai auto show in Shanghai, China April 16, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song  Apple is behind rivals such as South Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics Co and Huawei in delivering a phone equipped with fifth-generation (5G) modems that is expected to provide fresh momentum in a slumping global smartphone market.  Intel Corp, the sole supplier of modem chips for iPhones, has said its 5G chips will not appear in mobile phones until 2020, raising the possibility that Apple, its biggest customer, will be more than a year behind rivals in delivering a device that uses the faster 5G networks.  Samsung started selling 5G phones in South Korea this month ahead of the global introduction of 5G networks, and Huawei, whose smartphones outsold iPhones in the fourth quarter, plans to launch a 5G phone in June.  \u201cWe have not had discussions with Apple on this issue,\u201d Huawei\u2019s rotating Chairman Ken Hu said on Tuesday, adding he looked forward to Apple\u2019s competition in the 5G phone market.  His comment comes a day after CNBC published here an interview with Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei that the firm was \"open\" to selling its 5G chips to Apple.  Uncertainty over the availability of a 5G-equipped iPhone has weighed on the world\u2019s most valuable company - at $939 billion - as rivals unveil products such as foldable phones in a bid to revive stalling smartphone sales.  Brokerage UBS earlier this month said Apple, also battling falling iPhone sales, is increasingly in jeopardy of being unable to ship a 5G iPhone in 2020 which could cause near-term headwind for the company.  Apple held talks with Samsung, Intel and Taiwan\u2019s MediaTek Inc to supply 5G modem chips for 2019 iPhones, according to an Apple executive\u2019s testimony at a trial between Qualcomm Inc and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission earlier this year.  MORE 5G EQUIPMENT DEALS  Huawei, also the world\u2019s biggest telecoms equipment maker, said on Tuesday the number of contracts it has won to provide 5G telecoms gear increased further, in defiance of a U.S. campaign to squeeze the Chinese maker out of international markets on security grounds.  The comments come a day after Reuters reported, citing sources and documents, that the United States will push allies at a meeting in Prague next month to adopt shared security and policy measures that will make it more difficult for Huawei to dominate fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications networks.  Washington\u2019s concerns center around a Beijing directive that all Chinese companies cooperate with state intelligence work. Huawei has said it would never share data with the government.  Still, Huawei has secured 40 contracts to supply 5G gear as at March-end, from 30-plus disclosed last month, Hu said on Tuesday at the firm\u2019s annual global analyst summit at its Shenzhen headquarters in southern China.  Of the new total, Huawei signed 23 contracts in Europe, six in Asia-Pacific, 10 in the Middle East and one in Africa. Huawei also said has shipped over 70,000 5G base stations and expects to have shipped 100,000 by May.","1353":"* Dollar climbs to 16-month peak; pound falls on Brexit fears  * U.S. stock indexes sink; Apple, tech sector hit on weak views  * Global stocks gauge on track for 3rd straight drop  * Oil rises as Saudi Arabia seeks to tackle oversupply (Updates with opening of U.S. markets, changes dateline from London)  NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar surged on Monday to its highest point in 16 months against a basket of currencies and world stocks fell broadly amid concern about political risks in Europe, while a drop in Apple shares added pressure to U.S. equities and tech shares.

The company expects to roll out the feature to other Android smartphones at an unspecified time, it said in a blog post on Thursday, but plans for iPhones are unclear.  Apple\u2019s Watch, Google\u2019s Fitbit and other wearables have greatly expanded the reach of continuous heart rate sensing technologies to a much larger population.  The smartphone camera approach is more ad hoc - users who want to take a pulse place their finger over the lens, which catches subtle color changes that correspond to blood flow. Respiration is calculated from video of upper torso movements.  Google Health product manager Jack Po said that the company wanted to give an alternative to manual pulse checks for smartphone owners who only want to monitor their condition occasionally but cannot afford a wearable.  Po said the technology, which can mistake heart rates by about 2%, requires further testing before it could be used in medical settings.  The new feature will be available as an update to the Google Fit app.  Google consolidated its health services about two years ago, aiming to better compete with Apple, Samsung Electronics Co and other mobile technology companies that have invested heavily in marketing wellness offerings.","1364":"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean automaker Kia Corp said on Wednesday it\u2019s reviewing cooperation on self-driving electric cars with multiple foreign firms, making no mention of a report linking it to a project with tech giant Apple Inc.  Kia\u2019s comment, issued in a regulatory filing as its shares surged nearly 20% in Seoul, came after domestic online publication Edaily reported late on Tuesday that Kia\u2019s parent, Hyundai Motor Group, had decided Kia would be in charge of proposed cooperation with Apple on electric cars. The report cited unnamed industry sources.  Hyundai Motor declined to comment. Apple was not immediately available for comment outside of U.S. business hours.  Kia\u2019s listed sister company Hyundai Motor Co said earlier this month it was in early talks with Apple, after local media reported the firms were discussing an electric car and battery-tie up, sending Hyundai shares up nearly 25%. Apple declined to comment at the time.  In December, Reuters reported that Apple was moving forward with self-driving car technology and was aiming to produce a passenger vehicle that could include its own breakthrough battery technology as early as 2024.  Kia last week changed its corporate brand to simply \u2018Kia\u2019 from \u2018Kia Motors\u2019 in what it said was part of a new strategy aimed at taking the company \u201cbeyond vehicle manufacturing to create sustainable mobility solutions\u201d, without providing specific details of new projects.  \u201cChanging our corporate name and logo is not only a cosmetic improvement,\u201d said Kia President Song Ho-sung. \u201cIt represents us expanding our horizons and establishing new and emerging businesses that meet and exceed the diverse needs of our customers worldwide.\u201d  Shares in Kia were up 8.2%, while shares in Hyundai Motor were down 0.6% of 0254 GMT, compared with a 0.3% rise in the wider market.","1365":"(In paragraph 6, corrects day of week on Apple warning to Monday, not Tuesday)  WASHINGTON, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymakers were cautiously optimistic about their ability to hold interest rates steady this year, minutes of the central bank\u2019s last policy meeting showed, even as they acknowledged new risks caused by the coronavirus outbreak.  The readout on Wednesday of the policy discussion, at which policymakers unanimously voted to keep interest rates unchanged in a target range of between 1.50% and 1.75%, also showed Fed officials were skeptical about any big rethink of the central bank\u2019s inflation target.  \u201cParticipants generally saw the distribution of risks to the outlook for economic activity as somewhat more favorable than at the previous meeting,\u201d the Fed said in the minutes of the Jan. 28-29 meeting. It went on to say the current stance of monetary policy was likely to remain appropriate \u201cfor a time.\u201d  Coming into this year the Fed had made clear that, after three interest rate cuts in 2019, it plans to hold interest rates steady, barring a significant change in the U.S. economic outlook.  Policymakers have pointed to U.S. consumer spending levels, dissipating U.S-China trade tensions and loose financial conditions as supporting their view, but how long such an upbeat assessment can last has already been tested by escalating concern about the global economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak that started in China.  On Monday Apple Inc issued a revenue warning due to the disruption the epidemic is causing to its supply chain. China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, is still struggling to get its manufacturing sector back up and running after imposing severe travel restrictions to contain the flu-like virus.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week that it was too early to tell if the knock-on economic impact on the United States would be severe or sustained enough to cause the Fed to change its current path.  Since the outbreak began investors have brought forward their bets of when the Fed will cut interest rates again, to around June of this year. In the minutes, policymakers said the threat \u201cwarranted close watching.\u201d Despite that Fed officials offered a fairly upbeat assessment of the economy, expecting consumer spending to \u201clikely remain on a firm footing,\u201d job gains to expand at a healthy pace, continued moderate economic expansion and inflation returning to its 2% goal. The Fed is forecasting the economy growing 2.0% this year. That is at odds with some economic data released since the meeting. The Commerce Department reported last week a slowdown in consumer spending in January. Business investment has also experienced a deepening downturn and the U.S. manufacturing sector remains weak.  As part of a discussion on rethinking the Fed\u2019s inflation goal as part of the central bank\u2019s review of its main policy tools, there were vocal doubts about adopting an inflation range.  \u201cMost participants expressed concern that introducing a symmetric inflation range...could be misperceived as a signal that the Committee was comfortable with continued misses below its symmetric inflation objective,\u201d the Fed said. BALANCE SHEET Elsewhere in the minutes, Fed policymakers discussed how to handle its growing balance sheet. The Fed has been buying $60 billion monthly of U.S. Treasury bills since October to increase the level of reserves in the banking system in response to a liquidity crunch. Powell has said the Fed would likely begin scaling back that amount sometime in the April-June period, when the level of reserves in the banking system would likely be deemed adequate.  After that, \u201cregular open market operations would be required over time in order to accommodate trend growth in the Federal Reserve\u2019s liabilities and maintain an ample supply of reserves,\u201d Fed policymakers noted in the minutes.  Several policymakers asked for more discussion \u201cbefore long\u201d on the possibility of creating a standing repo facility, which would allow banks to borrow cash as needed at a fixed rate.

Thousands of contract workers in India\u2019s tech hub of Bengaluru gathered on Saturday outside a factory owned by Taiwanese firm Wistron Corp - a supplier for Apple Inc - to demand unpaid wages and better working hours.  As police arrived, the crowd turned violent and video from the scene showed people armed with rods and sticks smashing equipment and vandalising cars, causing up to $7.1 million in damage according to an estimate by the company.  The All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU) said the incident in the southern state of Karnataka was a result of workers being subjected to \u201cextremely exploitative sweatshop-like working conditions in gross violation of labour laws\u201d.  The workers earned far less than the promised 22,000 rupees ($299) monthly salary and were not paid wages for November, according to the AICCTU, which said government officials and the management at Wistron had not responded to their complaints.  \u201cThese workers are from very poor families and not getting their wages was pushing them to the brink,\u201d said Clifton D Rosario, national secretary at the AICCTU.  Apple said on Monday it was sending staff and auditors to the site and was cooperating with police. Wistron said in a regulatory filing in Taiwan it \u201calways abides by the law, and fully supports and is cooperating with relevant authorities\u201d.  A labour department official in Karnataka, who requested anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media, said on Tuesday that the issue was being resolved and workers would receive their dues. The factory would re-open soon, he added.  Labour rights experts warned that worker unrest in Indian manufacturing hubs could increase as new laws, which were passed in September, deny labourers the right to strike or receive social benefits if working for smaller companies.  \u201cThese flashpoints will continue,\u201d said P.K. Anand, a visiting researcher at the Delhi-based Institute of Chinese Studies, who works on labour issues in China and India.  \u201cIt is the only way for workers to be heard in the absence of legal safeguards and proper grievance redress mechanisms,\u201d Anand told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone.  FURTHER VIOLENCE FEARED  Wistron has been making iPhones in India for nearly four years and its operation has been seen as a success story for Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government that is looking to boost manufacturing under its \u201cMake in India\u201d slogan.  Several major tech brands including South Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics Co and China\u2019s Xiaomi Corp have outsourced production to or set up factories in India in recent years.  Wistron\u2019s Narasapura factory in Bengaluru employs about 1,300 permanent workers and at least 8,000 contract workers who were hired through various contractors, the AICCTU said.  Police said on Monday they had arrested 149 people over the violence, and were looking to find and arrest more perpetrators.  Rosario of the AICCTU said many of the other workers were \u201cpetrified\u201d and had switched off their phones to avoid contact.  While the government has said the new labour legislation - aimed at streamlining complex regulations - would protect workers, six states have this year relaxed or suspended labour laws to help industry recover from the coronavirus pandemic.  The changes mean workers could face longer days and lower pay, and risk fuelling more protests, according to researchers.  \u201cThis (Wistron incident) should purely be seen as a case of wage theft,\u201d said Rajesh Joseph, a professor teaching labour issues at the Azim Premji University in Bengaluru.  \u201cThere was no union to negotiate on behalf of the workers, inspections are non-exsistent and there is no mechanism for anonymous complaints. So where should a worker complain?

That rare forecast cut exposed weakening iPhone demand in China, the world\u2019s biggest smartphone market, where a slowing economy has also been buffeted by a trade war with the United States.  Many analysts and consumers have said the new iPhones are overpriced.  Apple asked its suppliers late last month to produce fewer-than-planned units of its XS, XS Max and XR models, the Nikkei reported, citing sources with knowledge of the request. (s.nikkei.com\/2TEJ02G)  The request was made before Apple announced its forecast cut, the Nikkei said. The bleaker sales outlook, which Apple attributed to weak China demand, triggered a broad sell-off in global stock markets.  Market research firm Canalys estimates shipments fell 12 percent in China last year and expects smartphone shipments in 2019 to dip another 3 percent, to below 400 million for the first time since 2014.  Overall planned production volume of both old and new iPhones is likely to be cut to a range of 40 million to 43 million units for January-March, from an earlier projection of 47 million to 48 million units, the Nikkei reported, citing one source familiar with the situation.  Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.  The report comes after chip suppliers Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Skyworks Solutions Inc flagged weak first-quarter chip demand for smartphones.  Apple\u2019s iPhone suppliers include Taiwanese assemblers Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn) and Pegatron Corp. Pegatron declined to comment on the report when contacted by Reuters, while Foxconn did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  There was little reaction to the report among shares of major Apple suppliers, as the market has already digested production cuts after the iPhone maker\u2019s forecast cut, analysts said.  Shares of Foxconn, the world\u2019s biggest electronics contract manufacturer, were up 1.6 percent while Pegatron was up 1.3 percent.  Among iPhone component suppliers in Asia, South Korea\u2019s LG Display Co Ltd was up 0.5 percent, while Japan Display Inc was flat.  As Chinese demand has faltered, Apple has increased focus on India, which recently overtook the United States as the world\u2019s second-largest smartphone market.  Chief Executive Tim Cook reiterated in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday that India was a major focus for Apple.  Reuters reported last month that Apple will begin assembling its top-end iPhones in India through the local unit of Foxconn this year, citing a person familiar with the matter.","1373":"* April nonfarm payrolls miss estimates  * Tepid wage growth eases inflation fears  * Apple hits record after Berkshire raises stake  * Indexes up: Dow 1.03 pct, S&P 0.89 pct, Nasdaq 1.29 pct  * Market had opened lower, before reversing course (Changes comment, adds details, updates prices)  By Sruthi Shankar  May 4 (Reuters) - Apple and other technology shares led a rally on Wall Street on Friday morning, helping it shrug off a choppy start following the April jobs report.  Apple jumped 3.8 percent to a record high of $183.65 after Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway raised its stake in the iPhone maker.

Pandora Media jumped 24.2 percent after the music streaming service provider reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 2.41-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq and for a 2.67-to-1 ratio on the NYSE.

Analysts believe it will be the technology company\u2019s first splashy launch event that will not feature new gadgets or hardware.  Hollywood celebrities are likely to trek to Apple\u2019s Cupertino home to greet the debut of a revamped Apple TV digital storefront. Apple has commissioned programming from A-list names such as Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg.  The Apple original shows are expected to be offered alongside the option to subscribe to content from Viacom Inc and Lions Gate Entertainment Corp\u2019s Starz, among others, sources have told Reuters.  Apple will join a crowded field where rivals such as Amazon.com\u2019s Prime Video and Netflix Inc have spent heavily to capture viewer attention and dollars with award-winning series and films.  The big tech war for viewers ignited a consolidation wave among traditional media companies preparing to join the fray. Walt Disney Co, which bought 21st Century Fox, and AT&T Inc, which purchased Time Warner Inc, plan to launch or test new streaming video services this year.  Apple\u2019s jump into original entertainment signals a fundamental shift in its business. Sales of hardware money-makers the iPhone, iPad and Mac were either stagnant or flat in its most recent fiscal year. Without another category-defining new gadget announced to the public, Apple is expected to rely on selling subscriptions and services like video, music and hardware insurance.  Revenue from its \u201cservices\u201d segment - which includes the App Store, iCloud and content businesses such as Apple Music - grew 24 percent to $37.1 billion in fiscal 2018.  The services segment accounted for only about 14 percent of Apple\u2019s overall $265.6 billion in revenue, but investors have pinned their hopes for growth on the segment.  Apple\u2019s TV push has been cloaked in mystery. Even producers of Apple\u2019s shows are unsure about many of the details about when and how audiences will be able to see their work.  On Monday, Apple also is expected to unveil an Apple News subscription option featuring content from major publishers and a new credit card with Goldman Sachs to bolster Apple Pay.  NOT TAKING ON NETFLIX  While Apple plans to spend $2 billion on original shows this year and has hired Hollywood veterans to oversee them, it is unlikely to take on Netflix or Amazon directly by including libraries of older shows. Instead, its model is expected to more closely resemble the App Store, offering paid subscriptions to other media companies\u2019 programming and keeping a cut of sales.  Ahead of the launch, Apple negotiated deals that would let Apple bundle and sell networks at a discount, replicating a business model from the cable TV industry, one source familiar with the matter said.  Apple\u2019s goal, other sources have told Reuters, is to bring together television shows in one place to make it easier to find, buy and watch them. Apple has worked to make it easier to watch the shows on traditional television from manufacturers such as Sony Corp, VIZIO Inc, LG Electronics Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.  Apple\u2019s pitch to Hollywood is that it has the potential to reach hundreds of millions of viewers. The company said in January there were 1.4 billion active Apple devices, 900 million of which are iPhones. It has positioned that as leverage against Netflix\u2019s 139 million global customers and the 100 million subscribers to Amazon\u2019s Prime shipping program, which includes the video service.  But the Silicon Valley company has a history of making quick progress when coming from behind: It launched its Apple Music streaming service years after rival Spotify Technology SA but has garnered 50 million listeners, nearly half of Spotify\u2019s 96 million premium subscribers. And Apple in January said its Apple News service had 85 million active users after being released less than four years ago.","1379":"NEW DELHI\/TAIPEI (Reuters) - Foxconn 2317.TW plans to invest up to $1 billion to expand a factory in southern India where the Taiwanese contract manufacturer assembles Apple AAPL.O iPhones, two sources said.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The move, the scale of which has not previously been reported, is part of a quiet and gradual production shift by Apple away from China as it navigates disruptions from a trade war between Beijing and Washington and the coronavirus crisis.  \u201cThere\u2019s a strong request from Apple to its clients to move part of the iPhone production out of China,\u201d one of the sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.  Foxconn said it does not comment on matters related to customers, while Apple did not respond to a request for comment.  Foxconn\u2019s planned investment in the Sriperumbur plant, where Apple\u2019s iPhone XR is made some 50 km west of Chennai, will take place over the course of three years, the second source said.  Some of Apple\u2019s other iPhones models, made by Foxconn in China, will be made at the plant, said both sources, who declined to be identified as the talks are private and details have yet to be finalised.  Taipei-headquartered Foxconn will add some 6,000 jobs at the Sriperumbur plant in Tamil Nadu state under the plan, one of the sources said. It also operates a separate plant in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, where it makes smartphones for China's Xiaomi Corp 1810.HK, among others.  Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way last month said it would ramp up its investment in India, without giving details.  STATUS SYMBOL  Apple accounts for about 1% of smartphone sales in India, the world\u2019s second-biggest smartphone market, where its pricey iPhones are often seen as a status symbol.  Building more phones in India will also help Apple save on import taxes that further push up its prices.  Apple assembles a few models through Taiwan's Wistron Corp 3231.TW in the southern tech hub of Bengaluru. Wistron is also set to open a new plant, where it plans to make more Apple devices, Reuters previously reported.  \u201cWith India\u2019s labour cheaper compared with China, and the gradual expansion of its supplier base here, Apple will be able to use the country as an export hub,\u201d Neil Shah of Hong Kong-based tech researcher Counterpoint said.  India is also working to boost electronics manufacturing by firms such as Foxconn and last month launched a $6.65 billion plan, offering five global smartphone makers incentives to establish or expand domestic production.  Having Apple widen its local presence is likely to be a boost for Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s flagship \u201cMake In India\u201d drive, aimed at creating new jobs.

Overall smartphone shipments in China totalled 97.6 million units, a 7% decrease from the year prior.  The contraction suggests that despite China\u2019s economic resumption following coronavirus-related lockdowns, consumers are tightening their belts and holding off purchases of new phones.

Shares of the iPhone maker jumped 6.37% after the company said sales in China were steadying and touted how rising demand for its services and accessories helped offset a record drop in iPhone revenue.  The company also announced plans for a new $75 billion share buyback and bumped up its cash dividend by 5%.

Global financial markets felt the shockwaves as Apple shares logged their biggest intra-day percentage fall in six years, sending the company\u2019s stock market value to under $700 billion, well below its $1.1 trillion October peak.  After Apple\u2019s first revenue warning in nearly 12 years, investors also dumped chipmakers and tech stocks and flocked to perceived safe havens like U.S. Treasuries and the Japanese yen. Developments in a patent dispute between Apple and Qualcomm in Germany also rattled investors.  A senior White House economic adviser said he expected trade uncertainty to hit earnings at many U.S. companies, but that sales at Apple and others with large exposure to China would recover once Washington and Beijing strike a trade deal.  \u201cThat is having an impact on earnings and it\u2019s not going to be just Apple,\u201d White House Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers Kevin Hassett said in an interview with CNN.  \u201cI think there are a heck of a lot of U.S. companies that have a lot of sales in China that are basically going to be watching their earnings be downgraded next year.\u201d  Economic deceleration in China had caught Apple off guard and trade tensions between Washington and Beijing were starting to hurt consumer spending on smartphones in China, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said on Wednesday.  Cook in November had cited slowing growth in emerging markets such as Brazil, India and Russia when Apple gave first-quarter sales estimates that were lower than expected. But he said then that he \u201cwould not put China in that category\u201d of countries with troubled growth.  The China slowdown comes as Apple faces other obstacles in some of its biggest markets.  Qualcomm Inc said it had posted security bonds to enforce a court order banning sale of some iPhone models in Germany, meaning Apple would likely have to pull iPhone 7 and 8 models from its 15 stores in the country.  The German case, part of a global patent spat between the two companies, is Qualcomm\u2019s third major effort to secure a ban on iPhones over patent-infringement allegations after similar moves in the United States and China.  Wall Street analysts scrambled to cut their price targets on Apple, with at least 27 lowering their estimates. The current median price target is $186.  Shares of U.S.-based Apple suppliers and chipmakers including Cirrus Logic Inc, Skyworks Solutions Inc , Analog Devices, Broadcom Inc, NXP Semiconductors NV and Micron Technology Inc all tumbled.  Many analysts and investors had worried about a slowdown in iPhone sales since the company said in November it would stop disclosing unit sales data for its phones and other hardware products.  Apple\u2019s latest comments fueled worries that its relatively high-priced devices may be falling out of favor in China, where rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd offer cheaper options.  Peter Richardson, a research director at Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Research, said it was difficult to see a catalyst that would help Apple recover lost ground in China.  \u201cUntil it changes this pricing strategy, it is unlikely to see market share growth and will most likely see a gradual contraction as iPhone users upgrade at slower rates,\u201d said Richardson.  Apple on Wednesday lowered its revenue forecast to $84 billion for its first quarter ended Dec. 29, below analysts\u2019 estimate of $88.05 billion. Apple originally forecast revenue of between $89 billion and $93 billion.  Apple shares were down 9.8 percent at $142.40. The stock has fallen about 30 percent since Cook said in November that the company may miss its holiday quarter sales estimate.","1391":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc's AAPL.O plan to ramp up iPhone production by 10% in the first half of this year may hit a roadblock as the coronavirus outbreak spreads across China, the Nikkei Asian Review reported on Tuesday.

Apple said at the time that the Infowars app remained in its store because it had not been found to be in violation of any content policies, although it had removed access to some podcasts by Jones.  The podcasts differ from the Infowars app by allowing access to an extensive list of previous episodes, subjecting all of those past episodes to Apple\u2019s content rules.  The Infowars app contains only rebroadcasts of the current day\u2019s episodes, subjecting a much smaller set of content to the rules.

Apple Inc rose 0.9% after U.S. trade regulators approved 10 out of 15 requests for tariff exemptions by the iPhone maker.  Micron Technology Inc, which supplies components to Apple, rose about 1.8%. The chipmaker is set to post its fourth quarter results on Thursday.  Meanwhile, U.S. employment in the services sector shrank for the first time in nine-and-a-half years in September, IHS Markit\u2019s Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index (PMI) showed on Monday. At 50.9, the services sector PMI was below expectations of 51.3.  The data also showed manufacturing activity rose in September, topping expectations.  Earlier in the day, a survey showed a manufacturing recession deepening in Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest economy.  Investors have been cautious about progress in Sino-U.S. trade talks after a Chinese agriculture delegation canceled a visit to Montana.

Sharp, a unit of Taiwan's Foxconn 2317.TW, has been operating its own smartphone panel plant almost at full capacity, in part due to the popularity of Apple's new lower cost iPhone SE.

The letters seek by Oct. 14 internal emails over the last decade from Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Alphabet CEO Larry Page, among others, about acquisitions.  Apple shares fell about 1.8% after the market opened. While Apple had been mentioned as a potential target, the House letter offered the first concrete evidence of a wide-ranging antitrust investigation.  Apple has faced criticism that its App Store\u2019s policies and algorithms support its own products and stifle third-party applications.  On Monday, the Texas attorney general led a group of 50 attorneys general from U.S. states and territories in a probe of whether Google abuses its market power in advertising.  \u201cThere is growing evidence that a handful of corporations have come to capture an outsized share of online commerce and communications,\u201d said House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat, who signed the letters along with Ranking Republican Representative Doug Collins and Representative David Cicilline, who chairs the antitrust subcommittee and ranking Republican Jim Sensenbrenner.  \u201cThis information is key in helping determine whether anticompetitive behavior is occurring, whether our antitrust enforcement agencies should investigate specific issues and whether or not our antitrust laws need improvement to better promote competition in the digital markets,\u201d Collins said in a statement.  The lawmakers seek emails from senior executives on topics including acquisitions like Amazon\u2019s purchase of AbeBooks, PillPack, Eero, Ring, Zappos and Whole Foods; and Google\u2019s acquisition of AdMob, YouTube, Android and DoubleClick.  They also seek information on various policies including Google\u2019s decision to automatically sign into Chrome any user to logs into any Google service.  Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Amazon and Facebook declined to comment. Google referred to a blog post this week that said its services \u201ccreate choice for consumers.\u201d  The committee requested information from the companies\u2019 executives on market share, competitors, their largest customers for specific products and documents from other investigations.  It asked Apple for information on App Store concerns such as the decision to remove some parental control apps and its policy regarding whether iPhone users can set non-Apple apps as defaults.  The committee seeks communications on Facebook\u2019s purchase of Instagram, WhatsApp and Onavo and its decisions to integrate Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp and to cut off apps from its social graph.  The U.S. Justice Department said in July it is investigating \u201cwhether and how\u201d large tech companies in \u201csearch, social media, and some retail services online\u201d are engaging in anticompetitive behavior.

Foxconn, which has a big facility in Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus outbreak, said its plants in China were following holiday schedules and would continue to do so until all businesses have resumed standard operating hours.  The outbreak has led countries including the United States to advise against all but necessary travel to China, forced food chains such as Starbucks to close stores and airlines to cancel flights.

II-VI will pay Finisar shareholders $26 per share, in cash and stock, a premium of 37.7 percent to Finisar\u2019s closing share price on Thursday.  Finisar\u2019s shares rose 18.5 percent, while those of II-VI fell 16.5 percent to $39.16.  The combined company would make a range of transceivers to help transfer high-speed data traffic through undersea cables and 5G networks.  Global telecom companies are spending billions to develop 5G networks, which will rely on denser arrays of small antennas to offer data speeds up to 50 or 100 times faster than current 4G networks.  II-VI, pronounced as two-six, was founded in 1971 to make optical compounds used to make solar cells, lasers and transistors.  The company is also targeting the fast-growing market for 3D sensing technology used for facial recognition in smartphones and detecting obstacles by self-driving cars.  Both the companies supply parts to Apple AAPL.O, but Finisar, which makes lasers that power iPhone Face ID, has an edge following an investment of $390 million from Apple in December.  The deal could give II-VI the scale and products needed to woo new customers as demand for 3D sensing technology grows among smartphone manufacturers.  II-VI\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Vincent Mattera Jr told Reuters that the company has been engaged in talks with a large number of potential new customers but did not disclose any names.  \u201cWe are being selective and they would not be surprises to most people who are in this space,\u201d Mattera said.

II-VI, which has a market value of about $3 billion, said it intends to fund the deal with cash reserves of both companies, a $2 billion debt raise and $1.4 billion of new equity issued to Finisar shareholders.

After the bell, the Cupertino, California company cut its sales forecast for its quarter ending in December, citing slowing iPhone sales in China.  That sent its stock down 7.5 percent after hours and knocked 1.3 percent off S&P 500 futures, suggesting the market was set to open weaker on Thursday as already skittish investors reconsider their earnings expectations for U.S. multinationals.  \u201cPeople are looking for a January rally effect as they place bets for the new year. Apple puts a bit of a sour tone on that,\u201d said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager of Synovus Trust Co. \u201cIt raises concerns about whether current estimates for the quarter are too high.\u201d  Including its after-hours drop on Wednesday, Apple\u2019s stock market value has tumbled to below $700 billion from over $1.1 trillion at its peak in October. Although it has fallen behind Amazon and Microsoft in value, Apple remains one of Wall Street\u2019s most widely-held companies, and its warning will affect sentiment across the stock market.  Following the S&P 500\u2019s worst December performance since the Great Depression, many investors this week returned from holidays optimistic that a correction that started last September may have run its course. The S&P 500 on Wednesday was up nearly 7 percent over five sessions from its recent low on Dec. 24.  Apple\u2019s revised fiscal first-quarter revenue estimate of $84 billion was nearly 12 percent short of the average analyst estimate, even after recent warnings about slow demand from iPhone component suppliers Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo .  With the S&P 500 recently trading at 14 times expected earnings, down from 18 times a year ago, a key argument for Wall Street bulls is that the stock market has become undervalued after its recent sell-off. But if Apple\u2019s warning is followed by many more, the S&P 500 may appear less of a bargain at current levels.  Analysts on average expect S&P 500 companies to increase their earnings per share by nearly 7 percent this year, far below their expectations of 24 percent EPS growth for 2018, according to the most recent estimate from Refinitiv\u2019s IBES. At the start of October, analysts had been forecasting 10 percent EPS growth for 2019.  Tech sector profit growth, a whopping 29 percent in the third quarter, is expected to slow to 12 percent for the fourth quarter and to dwindle to just 2 percent in the first quarter of 2019, according to the most recent IBES data.

The core of the line-up, the iPhone 12 with a 6.1-inch display, will sell for $799, while a \u2018Mini\u2019 version with a 5.4-inch screen will be slightly cheaper at $699. A \u2018Pro\u2019 version with three cameras and a new 3-D \u2018lidar\u2019 sensor starts at $999, with the largest \u2018Pro Max\u2019 starting at $1,099 and going up to $1,399.  The new products will test whether Apple can ride a wave of consumer excitement around 5G wireless data networks, whose speediest variants outstrip their predecessors\u2019 data rates multiple times over.  But whether iPhone buyers see a dramatic speed boost will depend heavily on where they are and which carrier they use - what Bob O\u2019Donnell, head of TECHnalysis Research, called \u201clots of little niggly details that get in the way of delivering on the promise of 5G.\u201d  He said Apple may be setting some customers up for disappointment when phones ship but offer only modest speed increases until carriers build out networks.  \u201cI don\u2019t feel like Apple clarified that as much as they could have,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.  Apple said all iPhone 12 models in the United States will support millimeter wave 5G, the fastest variant of the technology, as well as lower-frequency bands.  Outside of the United States, however, iPhones will lack millimeter wave compatibility, even in countries like Australia and South Korea where carriers are planning to roll out versions of the millimeter wave technology. Like some cheaper Android devices, iPhone 12 models in those countries will only support lower-frequency versions of 5G.  Apple said it had tested 5G on more than 800 carriers in 30 regions globally. Verizon Communications Inc CEO Hans Vestberg appeared on Apple\u2019s livestream presentation to announce that the phones would work with the U.S. carrier\u2019s \u2018ultrawideband\u2019 5G network, designed to alleviate bottlenecks in major cities like New York and Los Angeles, as well as in crowded areas like NFL stadiums.

Pre-orders for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro in the United States, Britain, China and some other countries begin Oct. 16 and deliveries start Oct. 23. The iPhone Mini and Pro Max will be available for pre-order Nov. 6 and in stores Nov. 13.

Shares of Apple fell over 3% during the event, erasing $77 billion worth of stock market value, and closed down 2.7%.  HOMEPOD MINI  Apple also announced a HomePod Mini smart speaker that will cost $99 and be shipped from Nov. 16. Many of the features serve as a catch-up to similar offerings from Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google.  But Ben Bajarin, principal analyst for consumer market intelligence at research firm Creative Strategies, said Apple had fleshed out its vision for how its devices could interact more directly with its own speakers than rivals had. For example, Apple customers can speak into their iPhone or iPad to use the HomePod Minis like an intercom system.  \u201cThat\u2019s not something that Google or Amazon, particularly Amazon, can do so cleanly,\u201d said Bajarin. \u201cThe advantage Apple has that they pressed on is that a good portion of those (Google and Amazon) customers have iPhones.

Brent crude was at $57.30 a barrel, down 37 cents, or 0.6%, by 0126 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 15 cents, or 0.3%, to $51.90 a barrel.  \u201cWhile it\u2019s more comfortable to call oil higher, given the likely pent-up demand to lead to a recovery from second quarter, it\u2019s far too early to suggest oil market concerns have dissipated,\u201d said Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiCorp.  U.S. stock futures slipped from record levels on Tuesday after Apple Inc, the most valuable company in the United States, said it will not meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter as the coronavirus outbreak slowed production and weakened demand in China.  The number of new coronavirus infections in mainland China fell below 2,000 on Tuesday for the first time since January, Chinese health officials said, although global experts warn it is too early to say the outbreak is being contained.  The International Energy Agency (IEA) said last week the virus was set to cause oil demand to fall by 435,000 barrels per day (bpd) year-on-year in the first quarter, in what would be the first quarterly drop since the financial crisis in 2009.  Still, with some Chinese independent refineries snapping up crude supplies after being absent from the market for weeks, traders held out hopes that China\u2019s demand could recover in coming months.  Investors are also anticipating that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, including Russia, will approve a proposal to deepen production cuts to tighten global supplies and support prices.  The group, known as OPEC+, has an agreement to cut oil output by 1.7 million bpd until the end of March.  Oil output from Libya has fallen sharply since Jan. 18 because of a blockade of ports and oil fields by groups loyal to eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar.  Libya\u2019s national oil corporation, NOC, said on Monday that oil production was at 135,745 barrels per day as of Monday, compared with 1.2 million bpd before the stoppage.

The iPhone maker\u2019s Chinese website listed the opening time for all stores, which varies from 10:00 am to 11:00 am local time. The website had previously carried an advisory saying not all stores were open.  Apple had announced the shuttering of its branded stores in early February.  China placed curbs on travel and asked residents to avoid public places in late January, just ahead of the Lunar New Year festival, a major gift-giving holiday. Those restrictions stayed largely in place through most of February.  The company sold fewer than half a million iPhones in China in February, government data showed on Monday, as the outbreak halved demand for smartphones.","1417":"(Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers have requested information from Apple critic Spotify as part of an antitrust probe, according to two sources briefed on the investigation into allegations the iPhone maker engages in anti-competitive behavior to support its own apps.  FILE PHOTO: A screen displays the company logo and trading info for Spotify on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 13, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee reached out to the music streaming service with broad requests for information, according to one source, who added the request to the company was narrowed in follow up telephone calls.  Spotify Technology SA filed an antitrust complaint against Apple in the European Union in March, but the contact with the committee marks its first known participation in congressional inquiries into the iPhone maker, whose Apple Music streaming service is Spotify\u2019s biggest rival.  Spotify and other developers have alleged that Apple engages in anticompetitive behavior by imposing rules that hamper distribution via its App Store, the only way for third-party developers to reach more than 900 million iPhone users.  At the same time, Apple sometimes copies the features of their apps for its own offerings, developers have said. Multiple apps in the App Store offered female cycle tracking before Apple added the same feature to its own health tracking app this fall, for example.  Apple has said it acts in the best interests of its users and treats all developers equally. It has denied Spotify\u2019s claims and says its streaming music rival is seeking to pay it nothing and play by a different set of rules than the millions of other apps on its App Store.  Spotify has been pressing for antitrust action against Apple for several years.  Its representatives have met with Justice Department officials, as well as members of the FTC\u2019s Technology Task Force, a group of some 17 attorneys that was set up in February to focus on online platforms and other Internet competition issues, according to one source.  App developers also complain that Apple\u2019s Siri, which responds to verbal commands and can control Apple\u2019s own apps, has long had limited functionality with the vast majority of non-Apple apps, including Spotify.  Apple announced an update to its software in June that would allow Siri to access Spotify and other music services.  Beyond Spotify, the congressional probe has tapped many companies for details on the four big tech firms.  In addition to the Judiciary Committee probe, the big tech companies face a plethora of other antitrust investigations.  The Justice Department is probing Alphabet\u2019s Google, Facebook and Apple while the Federal Trade Commission is investigating Facebook and Amazon.com. Groups of state attorneys general have also been formed to probe Google and Facebook.  Spotify has complained also about the 30 percent fee that Apple charges outside app developers who sell so-called digital goods such as music or e-books on the App Store, using Apple\u2019s in-app billing system. Apple bars app makers for collecting payment any other way on the App Store or showing users links or buttons to other ways to pay.  At one point, Apple told Spotify to stop sending emails to users who had just signed up for a free version of its streaming music prompting them to upgrade to the paid service, Spotify has said. Apple has said those emails were a workaround strategy to solicit payments outside its App Store system, violating the spirit of rules that all other app makers must follow.  Spotify has said the shifting rules, and Apple\u2019s threats to block routine app updates, have made it difficult to compete with Apple\u2019s own music service on a level playing field.  Asked for comment, Apple referred to its previous responses, published in March, to Spotify\u2019s claims. The company says it enforces its App Store rules evenly among all developers and that more than eight out of every 10 apps are free and pay nothing to Apple. Apple has said Spotify pays nothing for users of its free service or for paid Spotify members who signed up outside the App Store.  Apple has said Spotify pays a revenue share on about half a percent of its 108 million premium users, paying 15% fees on roughly 680,000 customers that Spotify acquired between 2014 and 2016 when it used Apple\u2019s payment systems.  \u201cEven now, only a tiny fraction of their subscriptions fall under Apple\u2019s revenue-sharing model. Spotify is asking for that number to be zero,\u201d Apple said in response to Spotify\u2019s claims it published in March.","1418":"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Apple Inc's AAPL.O new iPhone SE for the budget-conscious is unlikely to be a major driver of sales in China, a Weibo survey suggested, with analysts noting its lacks of 5G capability.  In a poll conducted on social media site Weibo, 60% of roughly 350,000 respondents said they would not buy the new $399 model, the cheapest iPhone available.  But roughly a fifth said they would buy it, while the rest said they would consider a purchase. Though respondents were not asked for reasons for their choices in the poll, many commented that they would be interested if the price drops further.  \u201cIf you don\u2019t buy it and I don\u2019t buy it, tomorrow the price will drop another 200 yuan ($28),\u201d said one Weibo user whose comment got more than 10,000 likes.  Apple\u2019s market share in China - its third-biggest market, accounting for roughly 15% of its sales - has shrunk over the past several years as Chinese Android brands increasingly release higher-end phones.  The reception for the iPhone SE was similarly muted in Europe, where almost 1 million people have caught the coronavirus and many countries have closed shops or ordered people to stay at home.  Despite the inauspicious backdrop, the new Apple device will offer owners of the ageing iPhone 6 an affordable way to get onto the latest and most secure version of Apple\u2019s iOS smartphone operating system, one industry analyst said.

REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  \u201cThese are people who keep their phones for four or five years, until they either break or the battery dies,\u201d said Annette Zimmermann at consultancy Gartner.  5G RACE  Competition has intensified in China as rivals are now releasing 5G devices compatible with the country\u2019s upgraded telecoms networks while Apple has yet to launch an iPhone with 5G capability.  Last week several Chinese online retailers reduced iPhone 11 prices by as much as 17%. Apple occasionally lets its Chinese seller partners cut prices to spur demand, though it seldom allows pricing leeway for vendors overseas.  Three China-based analysts said the iPhone SE would mainly appeal to Apple brand loyalists who don\u2019t want to spend about $700 for the high-end iPhone 11.  \u201cThe new iPhone SE will, for sure, attract mid-range users who don\u2019t take 5G connectivity as a necessity,\u201d said Mo Jia, who tracks the global smartphone industry at research firm Canalys.  Tech investors will nevertheless be watching its reception in China to gauge how demand for consumer devices may rebound once the coronavirus pandemic subsides and whether iPhone sales in China can soften the blow of lost purchases elsewhere.  China is the only major market where Apple\u2019s stores have reopened as the spread of the virus prompts governments around the world to impose lockdowns and other social distancing measures.  Government data showed that Apple shipped 2.5 million iPhones to Chinese vendors in March, nearly a fifth higher than the same month a year earlier and a sharp jump from only 500,000 in February, when the virus outbreak was at its peak in China.  The company will start taking orders for the phone on its website on Friday, with deliveries expected from April 24.","1419":"FRANKFURT, July 30 (Reuters) - Dialog Semiconductor forecast revenues of $360-$400 million in the third quarter after confirming a second-quarter profit beat thanks to a deal to transfer people and patents to iPhone maker Apple .

REUTERS\/Benoit Tessier  Countries are rushing to develop smartphone apps, which are seen as a way to help keep the novel coronavirus epidemic in check while reopening the economy.  The apps would use the Bluetooth feature that allows phones to interact with nearby devices to help detect when users come into contact with people who potentially carry the virus.  Apple\u2019s iPhones normally block access to Bluetooth unless the user is actively running an app. French officials want Apple to change the settings to let their app access Bluetooth in the background, so it is always on. So far, they say, Apple has refused.  \u201cApple could have helped us make the application work even better on the iPhone.

A spokesman for Apple in France declined to comment.  The issue of Bluetooth access on iPhones is one of several security-related questions that have arisen as countries try to roll out smartphone apps to fight the coronavirus.  France, along with some other countries, wants to keep contact data in a central database, arguing this would make it easier for the authorities to track suspected coronavirus cases.  Apple and Alphabet's GOOGL.O Google, between them responsible for the operating systems on nearly all smartphones, want data to be stored on the phones themselves, out of government reach, saying this would better protect the privacy of users.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc introduced its largest-ever iPhone and a watch that detects heart problems on Wednesday in an attempt to get customers to upgrade to more expensive devices in the face of stagnant global demand for smartphones.  The relatively small changes to its lineup, following last year\u2019s overhauled iPhone X, were widely expected by investors and the company\u2019s shares ended down 1.2 percent at $221.07.  The strategy has been successful, helping Apple\u2019s stock to rise more than 30 percent this year and making it the first publicly traded U.S. company to hit a market value of more than $1 trillion.  Apple\u2019s new iPhone XS, pronounced \u201cten S,\u201d has a 5.8-inch (14.7-cm) screen, and will be sold at a starting price of $999. The XS Max, the largest iPhone to date and one of the biggest on the market, has a 6.5-inch (16.5-cm) screen, and will start selling at $1,099.  \u201cThey have finally added a larger-screen phone so that they can directly compete with the Galaxy Note 9 products,\u201d Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann said at the event at Apple\u2019s Silicon Valley headquarters, referring to rival Samsung Electronics which has led the trend toward big-screen phones.  \u201cThe larger screen will be very important in China to turn around the trend there, because they have lost some share in the last few years, partly because of screen size,\u201d she added.  In China, the launch was the top trending topic on social media, with one conversation about it being read more than 890 million times on popular microblogging website Sina Weibo.  While online sentiment was mixed, an obvious key focus was the high price tag - also a target of criticism around the launch of the iPhone X last year.  \u201cBefore the launch I was thinking which kidney I should sell off, the left or the right. Now the decision is made up. I\u2019ll have to sell off both,\u201d joked one user on the platform.

This year\u2019s three top phones are all more expensive than last year\u2019s models.

It is positioning the new watch as a more comprehensive health device, able to take an electrocardiogram to detect an irregular heartbeat and start an emergency call automatically if it detects a user falling down, potentially appealing to older customers.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it worked with Apple to develop apps for the Apple Watch and has been taking steps to ease the regulatory pathway for companies seeking to create digital healthcare products.  As many as 6.1 million Americans have atrial fibrillation, a heart disease involving irregular heart rhythm for which the Watch could offer an early warning. That number is expected to double by 2050 as the population gets older, according to the American Heart Association.  \u201cThis does have a lot of potential for patients,\u201d said Dr. Michael Valentine, president of the American College of Cardiology and a cardiologist at Central Health in Lynchburg, Virginia. \u201cClinicians face patients every day with palpitations, rapid heart rates, and other symptoms,\u201d and the doctors want a more portable monitoring and recording system.

The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) is looking at whether Apple interfered in Yahoo Japan\u2019s operations by pressuring it to cut back on developing its Game Plus web-based service which enables users to stream games without downloading apps, the Nikkei newspaper reported.  Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman at Yahoo Japan, one of the country\u2019s most successful internet companies, declined to comment on the report, but said that the site continued to add game titles.  Shares in Yahoo Japan fell around 2.5 percent in early trade, while the broader market slipped 0.5 percent.  Last month, the FTC said Apple could have breached antitrust rules by forcing Japanese mobile service providers to sell its iPhones cheaply and charge higher monthly fees, denying consumers a fair choice.  Game Plus offers free and fee-based games developed by Square Enix Holdings Co and other game publishers, some of which are also available on the App Store for Japan-registered users. Yahoo Japan\u2019s gaming site has more than 60 million monthly users, which the company and game publishers can tap for usage history and other data.

But below the surface, the estimates reveal a wide range among the companies that comprise the S&P 500 information technology sector, which includes Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp as well as communications equipment, hardware and IT services companies.  The overall sector\u2019s earnings performance is being dragged down by semiconductors, which are expected to post a nearly 27% plunge in quarterly profits, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, as analysts point to impact from the U.S.-China tariff conflict and generally weak demand.  Growing business IT spending continues to support other pockets of tech, according to investors. Software firms are poised for a nearly 11% gain in profits from a year ago, according to the IBES data from Refinitiv.  \u201cYou may have two dynamics going on in tech in the opposite direction,\u201d said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio. \u201cCan software live up to the numbers and will semis beat the numbers?\u201d  Among software companies, Microsoft, the largest U.S. company by market value, reports results on Wednesday, while earnings are also due next week from semiconductor stalwarts Intel Corp and Texas Instruments Inc.  Other tech earnings next week include payment processors PayPal Holdings Inc and Visa Inc, with iPhone maker Apple, whose results ripple through its supply chain, expected to post a 2.7% drop in earnings when it reports the following week.  One of the early reporters, International Business Machines Corp, kicked off the season on a sour note on Wednesday, with quarterly revenue that missed estimates.  Even with the disparate forecasts for the third-quarter company results, tech stocks are outshining the market broadly in 2019.  The S&P 500 tech sector, which comprises over one-fifth of the benchmark index, has climbed more than 30% in 2019, compared to a 19% rise for the S&P 500.  Federal Reserve easing of interest rates has helped the performance, which comes despite uncertainty about the health of the global economy and about U.S.-China trade tensions.  Tech is \u201cthe primary growth engine of the economy,\u201d said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston.  \u201cChina is an issue for them, but at the same time they continue to grow and they continue to innovate,\u201d Joy said. \u201cYou have to have exposure in technology. We just think as you look around at the market landscape, it\u2019s one of the better places to be right now.\u201d  The tech sector\u2019s strength is broad-based, including gains so far this year of about 30% or more from the four biggest industry groups by market value within the tech sector: software , IT services, hardware, storage & peripherals and semiconductors.  \u201cThe IT budget continues to garner more dollars from the general budget of Corporate America,\u201d said Michael Seidenberg, portfolio manager for the global technology team at Allianz Global Investors. \u201cThere will be winners and losers within the sector, but I think generally speaking that is a trend that has persisted.\u201d  Of U.S. corporations, semiconductor makers are seen as among the most affected by the U.S.-China trade tensions, which have triggered big swings in their shares.  But the stocks still have prospered: the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index has climbed nearly 40% this year to all-time highs, while three chip stocks - KLA Corp , Lam Research Corp, Advanced Micro Devices Inc - are the tech sector\u2019s biggest 2019 gainers.  Despite the steep decline in third-quarter profits projected for S&P 500 semiconductor companies, analysts are optimistic there will be improvement soon, with semiconductors expected to post an 11% rise in 2020 earnings, according to Refinitiv data.  \u201cTo me, there\u2019s a huge disconnect between the performance of these names and the underlying fundamentals,\u201d said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust in Atlanta.  For software and other tech companies, the third quarter can be seasonally weak, said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh, who said she would be looking for executives to comment on whether business is being pushed back to future quarters.  But the strong employment market has supported tech stocks, Forrest said.  \u201cThis a phenomenon you see in the late stages of an expansion,\u201d Forrest said. \u201cHiring is up and to support all the new people that you\u2019ve hired, you to add to your technology.\u201d","1432":"May 23 (Reuters) - Apple Inc:  * APPLE OFFERING $50 CREDIT TO CUSTOMERS WHO PAID FOR OUT-OF-WARRANTY BATTERY REPLACEMENT FOR IPHONE 6 OR LATER DEVICES BETWEEN JAN 1, 2017 AND DEC 28 Source text :(apple.co\/2x5pTZ8) Further company coverage:","1433":"Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple is bumping up against its iPhone limits. The smartphone market is mature, and soft demand for the $1,000-plus X model suggests the company led by Tim Cook has maxed out on pricing. The company\u2019s just-ended quarter - revenue rose 16 percent to $61.1 billion - shows Apple can still sell a lot of phones and more accessories and services. And a robust balance sheet means it plans to repurchase another $100 billion in shares and increase the dividend. But the lack of a hot product could start to test investors\u2019 patience.  The smartphone race is largely over, with Apple and Google\u2019s Android operating system the winners. Global handset shipments declined 0.5 percent last year, estimates market-research firm IDC, and should grow less than 3 percent annually over the next five years. Apple might steal customers, but that\u2019s a difficult task, and one that grows harder as the pace of technological progress slows. Apple sold only 3 percent more phones in the quarter compared with a year earlier, despite what it said were major improvements.  Apple has used design and branding to raise prices. The average price of an iPhone rose 11 percent from a year earlier in the latest quarter. That\u2019s unusual in tech, as hardware prices tend to fall. But it\u2019s questionable whether the Cupertino-based giant can go much higher. Average sales prices fell 9 percent from the preceding quarter, undershooting analysts\u2019 estimates, presumably implying a lower ratio of Xs sold.  The company can still wring more dollars out of buyers. Service revenue, which includes the app store, streaming music and online storage, rose 31 percent to $9.1 billion. Sales of \u201cother products\u201d also rose 38 percent to $4 billion, thanks at least in part to increased sales of things like headphones to iPhone users.  The shares jumped more than 3 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday, yet excitable tech investors could lose interest in Apple\u2019s comfortable \u2013 if capped \u2013 immediate future. Back in 2016, disappointment with the iPhone 6S sparked talk that Apple had lost its edge, and the stock underperformed the S&P 500 multiple for several quarters. Apple\u2019s more generous payout to shareholders should take some of the sting out of any similar disenchantment today. But the company will face increasing pressure to show it has more tricks up its sleeve.","1434":"FILE PHOTO: The Apple logo is shown atop an Apple store at a shopping mall in La Jolla, California, U.S., December 17, 2019, 2019.

The Franco-Italian chipmaker, whose customers range from carmakers to industrial groups and makers of new connected devices, said sales should grow in the first half, offsetting a seasonal smartphone dip in the first three months of the year.  STMicro\u2019s shares were up by more than 4 percent at 0919 GMT, making the stock one of the top ten performers in the pan-European STOXX 600 index.  The Geneva-based group forecasts come as investor concerns about a potential stagnation of smartphone demand intensified after South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc Inc\u2019s warned of a slower growth in smartphone chip sales on Tuesday.  SK Hynix Inc outlook echoed a warning last week from Apple supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and European rival AMS of a downturn owing to weak orders.  Analysts estimate that Apple represents about 10 percent of STMicro\u2019s revenues. The group makes imaging and proximity sensor products used in the iPhone X, according to analysts.  \u201cWe expect STMicro to benefit from a strong second-half due to continuing strength in the automotive and IoT (Internet of Things) segments, and the ramp of multiple new iPhone models with 3D sensing later in the year,\u201d Liberum said in a note.  STMicro does not name its customers, but chief executive Carlo Bozotti said he expected \u201chealthy demand\u201d across all its products in the second-half, including smartphones.  The veteran STMicro boss, who is expected to make way for his deputy Jean-Marc Chery to take over in June, said demand from the automotive industry was particularly high.  \u201cWe see a strong demand on automotive everywhere,\u201d he said during a call with analysts. \u201cWe don\u2019t see any sign of accumulation of inventories.

FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc. logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, New York, U.S., October 16, 2019.

Supplies and donations have come in from wealthy executives and corporates around the world to fight the coronavirus, which has killed more than 42,000 people globally.  Chinese billionaire and Alibaba BABA.N co-founder Jack Ma has pledged similar medical supply donations including masks and testing kits, as have other Chinese tech giants such as Baidu BIDU.O, Tencent 0700.HK, Huawei and ByteDance, according to Chinese media reports.  Apple has already donated 20 million yuan of its promised amount through Beijing-based China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation to support six hospitals in Hubei, including the makeshift Leishenshan hospital in Wuhan, Cook said.  Apple will contribute the rest of the money to support longer-term public health recovery efforts, he said.  \u201cChina has shown incredible spirit and resilience during the COVID-19 outbreak and we are grateful to our teams, partners and customers for their support during these challenging times,\u201d Cook said in a message on China\u2019s Twitter equivalent Weibo.  COVID-19 is the name of the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.  Apple warned last month it was unlikely to meet its March-quarter sales guidance as the ramp-up of Chinese factories that produce iPhones was slower than expected after weeks of closures.  The flu-like virus originated in China last year and has since spread across 205 countries and territories. Globally it has infected more 850,000 people, according to a Reuters tally.","1437":"(Reuters) - Shares in Apple Inc AAPL.O fell 6 percent on Friday, cutting its market value back to less than $1 trillion after it forecast softer-than-expected sales for the holiday quarter and fueled nerves over iPhone sales by saying it would no longer release the figures.  The dip in Apple's shares to $208.50 knocked around $67 billion off its value, and put Amazon and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O back in the mix in the race among the United States' big tech players to be the world's most valuable company.  The Cupertino, California-based company blamed weakness in emerging markets and foreign exchange costs for a disappointing forecast for sales in the run-up to Christmas that are crucial to results for consumer electronics producers.  Most analysts were still upbeat on fourth-quarter results, and there was no obvious fallout for rest of the FAANG group of major U.S. tech stocks.

Apple said the program, which should help ease heavy demand on Apple and its authorized partners to fix millions of cracked screens and fried charging ports, will launch in the United States before being rolled out to other countries.  The back flip means that independent repair shops will be offered official parts for out-of-warranty repairs at the same price offered to authorized service providers, such as Best Buy Inc, which perform warranty work.  Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, said the move could create more opportunities for Apple to sell services or accessories if it encourages iPhone owners to hand down used phones to friends and family.  \u201cThat helps them get the product more affordably into the hands of more customers and increases the base,\u201d Bajarin said. \u201cEvery data point seems to say, if you get someone into the Apple ecosystem, they generally don\u2019t leave.\u201d  Apple\u2019s iPhone sales have declined in the past two fiscal quarters, but sales of accessories such as its AirPods wireless headphones and the Apple Watch, along with paid services like Apple Music, have helped make up for some of the revenue falls.  Independent shops have long complained that the high purchase volumes required by Apple to become an authorized service provider priced them out of the repair market.  The tech giant had previously lobbied against \u201cright-to-repair\u201d bills to supply independent businesses in several U.S. states, including New York and California, citing concerns about maintaining a high service standard. It earlier this year allowed all U.S. Best Buy stores to handle warranty work.  However, the unofficial repair industry that sprang up, using mostly aftermarket parts supplied by third parties, was often unreliable.  Apple said it trialled the new repair program for a year with 20 businesses across North America, Europe and Asia. It did not give a timetable for the international launches.  The program will allow independent stores to set their own prices for repairs and also offer cheaper aftermarket parts. They will be required to return any collected broken Apple parts to the company for refurbishment or recycling.  The program will be free for shops to join, but they will be required to have an Apple-certified technician who has taken a free 40-hour training course and test provided by the company.","1439":"SAN FRANCISCO\/TAIPEI (Reuters) - Travel restrictions to China because of the coronavirus have come just as Apple Inc's AAPL.O engineers usually jet off to Asia to perfect the production of this fall's new iPhones, former employees and supply chain experts told Reuters.  FILE PHOTO: People wearing protective masks wait for checking their temperature in an Apple Store, in Shanghai, China, as the country is hit by an outbreak of the novel coronavirus, February 21, 2020. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  High-volume manufacturing is not scheduled until summer, but the first months of the year are when Apple irons out assembly processes with partners such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co's 2317.TW Foxconn, two former Apple employees said.  \u201cThey probably have one assembly line they\u2019re trying things out on,\u201d said one of the former employees who asked not to be named discussing production matters.  \u201cAre Apple\u2019s engineers with the Foxconn engineers? If they are, they\u2019re probably making progress. But if they\u2019re not, if they\u2019re quarantined, that could be bad.\u201d  While Apple uses other contract manufacturers such as Wistron Corp 3231.TW to make some iPhones, Taiwan's Foxconn tends to handle the introduction of new models because its capabilities are the most advanced, supply chain experts said.  Foxconn, the world\u2019s largest contract electronics maker, delayed reopening key iPhone factories in Shenzhen and Zhengzhou after the Lunar New Year holiday but hopes to resume half of its Chinese production by the end of February.  Senior Foxconn officials who have been working remotely from Taipei since the holiday have not yet returned to China on a large scale, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, speaking of company officials generally.  Apple declined to comment. Foxconn did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Last week, Apple warned investors it was unlikely to meet revenue targets for the first three months of 2020 and that global iPhone supplies would be limited as manufacturing sites in China were not ramping up production as quickly as expected.  Foxconn said this month that the coronavirus outbreak would lower its revenue this year.  Earlier this month, United Airlines UAL.O, which has disclosed that Apple is a major customer, said it was cancelling all fights to China until late April. Apple, meanwhile, said on Jan. 28 that it was restricting employee to travel to China to \"business-critical\" situations.  COLLABORATION CRITICAL  For new iPhone models, the transition from prototype to the assembly of millions of units starts in earnest when the Lunar New Year holiday in China ends in late January and early February, people familiar with the process said.  At that point, Apple has tested numerous prototypes and is in the late stages of what is called engineering validation, in which Foxconn workers assemble small numbers of devices while engineers from both firms troubleshoot.  If delays occur at this stage it would eat into the time Apple needs to finalise orders for chips and other parts, almost all of which are custom-made for the iPhone.  Because of the huge volumes needed, \"they can't wait to make component selections\", said Ron Keith, founder of Supply Chain Resources Group, which works with electronics makers such as Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Nest.  In March and April, Apple engineers typically work with Foxconn counterparts to set up new assembly lines and do trial runs, before making final adjustments in April and May. The aim is to have production lines up and running in June so others can be added progressively to ramp up output.  \u201cIt\u2019s very complicated. There are so many variables in the environment, including small factors such as air pollution,\u201d one of the people familiar with the process said.  Anna-Katrina Shedletsky, a former Apple engineer and founder of Instrumental, a startup focussed on factory automation based in Mountain View, California, said on-the-ground engineering collaboration was critical for new products.  \u201cYou can fly those engineers somewhere else but there\u2019s knowledge about how you make a product in that environment. It\u2019s not that it can\u2019t be taught but it\u2019s a hard thing to move,\u201d she said.  While supply chain experts and industry insiders say Apple still has time to keep its annual iPhone schedule on track, travel restrictions have left it in a tough spot.  \u201cThere is no face-to-face work being done,\u201d an executive at a semiconductor firm that supplies smartphone companies and works with teams in China said, speaking generally about phone production cycles.  \u201cAnd the word is, that\u2019s probably not going to change for another month at best. You\u2019re really talking about two lost months, which in the consumer electronics cycle is huge.\u201d","1440":"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Apple will employ trafficking survivors to work in its retails stores, the technology giant said, after winning an international award for making details of its supply chains public in a bid to help end modern slavery.  Since 2012 Apple says it has reduced the number of underage workers in its extended supply chain, which includes locations where rare earth minerals are mined for use in smartphones.  Labour rights groups had previously criticized Apple and its biggest manufacturing partner Foxconn for excessive overtime, hiring underage workers and failing to provide health insurance.  \u201cAs a company whose work touches the lives of so many people, we feel we have an enormous responsibility ... to turn our values into action,\u201d Angela Ahrendts, head of retail at Apple, said during Trust Conference in London on Wednesday, which is hosted by the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  \u201cThough we\u2019ve only just started, we see a tremendous opportunity to be a beacon of hope for trafficking survivors by integrating them into our worldwide retail teams,\u201d she said, receiving the prize designed by British sculptor Anish Kapoor.  The Thomson Reuters Foundation Stop Slavery Award recognizes efforts by companies to identify, investigate and eradicate forced labor from their supply chains.  Apple said it has also returned over $30 million to 35,000 foreign contract workers who were coerced by unscrupulous recruiters to pay excessive fees to be employed by the company.  Consumer goods giant Unilever was the other winner of the annual award, while financial services firm Standard Chartered and Thailand-based seafood producer Thai Union were highly commended for their work.  More than 40 million people are estimated to be trapped as slaves in forced labor and forced marriages, most of them women and girls, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO) and rights group Walk Free Foundation.  Nearly 25 million work in factories, on construction sites, farms, fishing boats and as domestic or sex workers, says ILO.  With slavery now considered a major global issue, there is growing scrutiny on initiatives to meet a U.N. goal to end by 2030 a trade estimated to raise annual illicit gains of $150 billion for traffickers.  Businesses are under increased pressure from both governments and consumers to disclose what actions they are taking to ensure their supply chains are free from slavery.  The world\u2019s largest canned tuna company, Thai Union Group PCL, has also pledged to tackle potential labor abuse and overfishing, seeking to clean up the Thai seafood industry.  Thailand\u2019s multibillion-dollar seafood sector has come under fire in recent years after investigations showed widespread slavery, trafficking and violence on fishing boats and in onshore food processing factories.  The company said in 2016 it would eliminate recruitment fees for its workers to prevent laborers from racking up debts to job brokers and from being exploited and abused.  The Stop Slavery Award was won last year by sports giant German sportswear giant Adidas, global fashion retailer C&A, U.S. technology company Intel, and British retail and services group The Co-operative Group.","1441":"June 29 (Reuters) - Apple Inc is rebuilding the widely used mapping application on its iPhones from the ground up with its own dataset, but Amsterdam-based TomTom NV will continue to be a data provider for Apple\u2019s maps app, Cupertino, California-based Apple told Reuters on Friday.

REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple\u2019s pricey strategy carries risk. Making its new iPhones more expensive helped boost the tech giant\u2019s revenue 20 percent in the latest quarter. Now Tim Cook is applying the same formula to the company\u2019s Macs, iPads and accessories. But a growth warning suggests even Apple fans may have sticker shock.  The $1 trillion company generates roughly 60 percent of its sales, and most of its profit, from the iPhone. While handset volume was flat in the latest quarter compared with the same period a year earlier, at 46.9 million, these yielded over $37 billion of revenue, thanks to a nearly 30 percent jump in the average sales price, to $793 per phone.  Apple\u2019s customer loyalty, design, penchant for security, incremental improvements and customer privacy ensure that most people and companies replacing old iPhones have been willing to pay a higher price for a new one.  The company also continued to squeeze more dollars out of iPhone users. Services revenue shot up 17 percent to $10 billion as users bought more apps from Apple\u2019s online store and storage, and used their phones for more payments. Perhaps $2 billion of this \u2013 the company doesn\u2019t break out the figure \u2013 came from Alphabet\u2019s Google in return for Apple making it the default search engine on iPhones, according to a recent Goldman Sachs estimate.  That leaves Apple\u2019s other gadgets. Demand for Macs and iPads is mature. Other items such as watches and earphones are growing faster, but in total these businesses account for only about a quarter of revenue. So Apple is replicating its iPhone strategy and raising prices on new models it rolled out this week in time for the holiday quarter.  It\u2019s not clear this formula will work, though. Apple warned that revenue in the current quarter, its busiest of the year, would be between $89 billion and $93 billion. The midpoint would represent growth of only about 3 percent, which would be a big step down from the previous quarter\u2019s 17 percent pace. Its shares tumbled nearly 5 percent in after-hours trading.

Facebook FB.O, which has long been at odds with Apple over privacy issues, seized on the backlash to attack the commissions too. It said Apple had declined a request to waive the fees for the social network's new online events product, framing the decision as a refusal to assist small businesses.  Analysts believe users of Apple devices spend the most on gaming through their purchases on the App Store, which is the largest component of the company\u2019s services segment revenue of $46.3 billion per year.  \u201cWe are somewhat surprised that Epic is the one that has chosen to mount the challenge as Epic also operates a digital store where they take a cut of third-party sales,\u201d Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani said.  Apple, Google and Facebook are among major American technology companies that have come under fire for their alleged abuse of market power and just last month their chief executives were grilled by lawmakers in a five-hour long congressional hearing.  Companies, including music streaming service provider Spotify Technology SA SPOT.N and the owner of Hinge and other dating apps Match Group Inc MTCH.O, issued statements supporting Epic, with Match accusing Apple of using its \"unfair policies to hurt consumers, app developers and entrepreneurs.\"  Gene Muster, a managing partner at Loup Ventures, said developer benefits have enabled the App Store to be a trusted source of software and content for nearly 1.4 billion active Apple devices.  \u201cLowering or eliminating the fee would jeopardize the integrity of the App Store,\u201d he added.  Launched in 2017, \"Fortnite\" has amassed a huge following among young gamers and its popularity has pushed the valuation of Epic Games to over $17 billion in a funding round earlier this year. The free-to-play battle-royal videogame competes with Tencent Holdings Ltd's 0700.HK \"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds\".  In both Apple\u2019s App Store and Google\u2019s Play Store, \u201cFortnite\u201d had about 2 million downloads in July 2020, according to mobile analytics firm SensorTower. But Apple users spent about $34 million, while Android users spent only $2 million, according to its data.","1444":"(Reuters) - The following are some hot stocks including the so-called FAANG technology stocks - Facebook Inc FB.O, Amazon.com AMZN.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O - as well as other companies in which hedge fund managers either took new stakes, adding to or exiting existing positions in the first quarter, filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed on Tuesday.

Taiwan-based assembler Pegatron Corp 4938.TW fell 5 percent and rival Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn) 2317.TW dropped 3.6 percent. Apple is widely considered the biggest customer for Foxconn.  Apple shares fell nearly 4 percent on Monday after the report by the Nikkei financial daily, which fueled concerns that the iPhone XR - the cheapest of three iPhones unveiled in September - was facing weak demand just days after it went on sale.  The Nikkei, citing supply chain sources, said Apple had also asked smaller iPhone assembler Wistron Corp 3231.TW to stand by for rush orders, but the firm would receive no planned orders for the iPhone XR this season.  Wistron shares were down 0.8 percent on Tuesday.  \u201cFoxconn\u2019s proportion of orders is bigger than Pegatron\u2019s with a ratio of about 6 to 4.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Apple is seen at a store in Zurich, Switzerland January 3, 2019. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann\/File Photo  Qualcomm, for its part, alleges that Apple forced its longtime business partners to quit paying some royalties and is seeking up to $15 billion.  Filed by Apple in early 2017, the lawsuit in federal court revolves around the modem chips that connect devices like the iPhone or Apple Watch to wireless data networks. Qualcomm has spent the past two years mounting a pressure campaign of smaller legal skirmishes against Apple, seeking - and in some cases obtaining - iPhone sales bans for violating its patents.  The trial before Judge Gonzalo Curiel will play out on Qualcomm\u2019s home turf of San Diego, where for decades the city\u2019s National Football League team played in Qualcomm Stadium and nearly every business district hosts the mobile chip firm\u2019s logo.  For Apple, the trial is about the freedom to determine its own technology path for blockbuster products by buying chips without having to pay what it calls a \u201ctax\u201d on its innovations in the form of patent licensing fees to Qualcomm that take a cut of the selling price of its devices.  For Qualcomm, the trial, along with similar allegations from U.S. regulators in a January court hearing, will determine the fate of its unique blend of selling chips and licensing more than 130,000 patents.  Licensing generates most of Qualcomm profits. The model propelled Qualcomm from a small contract research and development shop when founded in 1985 to a global chip powerhouse important enough to U.S. national security that President Donald Trump personally intervened to prevent a hostile takeover of the company last year.  \u201cThis is the day of reckoning that Qualcomm has been very fortunate to avoid for many years,\u201d said Gaston Kroub, a patent attorney with Kroub, Silbersher & Kolmykov who is not involved in the case. \u201cIn Apple, they\u2019ve finally come up against a potential licensee that has the resources and the will to put Qualcomm\u2019s business model and licensing practices on trial.\u201d  Qualcomm requires device makers to sign a license to its patents before it will supply chips, which it views as a commonsense measure to ensure it does not do business with companies violating its patents. But Apple and other device makers around the world have called the \u201cno license, no chips\u201d policy a form of \u201cdouble dipping\u201d - that is, charging for the same intellectual property once during licensing discussions, and then again in the price of the chips where the patents are embodied.  Apple and allies are asking for an end to that practice and a refund of about $9 billion - an amount that could be tripled if a jury finds in Apple\u2019s favor for antitrust allegations - for contract factories such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd\u2019s Foxconn, who paid the royalties and were reimbursed by Apple. Apple alleges the practices kept rivals like Intel Corp out of the market for years.  \u201cEven very big companies like Intel have felt at a disadvantage,\u201d said Michael Salzman, an antitrust attorney with Hughes Hubbard & Reed not involved in the case.  Qualcomm will argue that it had been working successfully with contract factories for years before Apple introduced its iPhone. But Apple used its heft in the industry to get those factories to break their longstanding contracts with Qualcomm, depriving it of at least $7 billion in royalties it was due, the chip supplier alleges.

The OLED display market is dominated by Samsung Electronics unit Samsung Display and LG Display, with Chinese players quickly catching up. OLED displays are generally thinner and allow more flexibility than LCD screens.  Samsung Display is currently the exclusive supplier of OLED panels for iPhones, while LG Display provides a majority of panels for the Apple Watch.

FILE PHOTO: A Qualcomm sign is seen during the China International Import Expo (CIIE), at the National Exhibition and Convention Center in Shanghai, China November 6, 2018. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  Qualcomm is seeking the ban in hopes of dealing Apple a blow before the two begin a major trial in mid-April in San Diego over Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing practices. Qualcomm has sought to apply pressure to Apple with smaller legal challenges ahead of that trial and has won partial iPhone sales bans in China and Germany against Apple, forcing the iPhone maker to ship only phones with Qualcomm chips to some markets.  Any possible ban on iPhone imports to the United States could be short-lived because Apple last week for the first time disclosed that it has found a software fix to avoid infringing on one of Qualcomm\u2019s patents. Apple asked regulators to give it as much as six months to prove that the fix works.  Qualcomm brought a case against Apple at the U.S International Trade Commission in 2017 alleging that some iPhones violated Qualcomm patents to help smart phones run well without draining their batteries. Qualcomm asked for an import ban on some older iPhone models containing Intel Corp chips.  In September, Thomas Pender, an administrative law judge at the ITC, found that Apple violated one of the patents in the case but declined to issue a ban. Pender reasoned that imposing a ban on Intel-chipped iPhones would hand Qualcomm an effective monopoly on the U.S. market for modem chips, which connect smart phones to wireless data networks.  Pender\u2019s ruling said that preserving competition in the modem chip market was in the public interest as speedier 5G networks come online in the next few years.  Cases where the ITC finds patent violations but does not ban the import of products are rare. In December, the full ITC said it would review Pender\u2019s decision and decide whether to uphold or reverse it by late March.  In filings that became public late last week ahead of the full commission\u2019s decision, Apple for the first time said that it had developed a software fix to avoid running afoul of Qualcomm\u2019s patent. Apple said it did not discover the fix until after the trial and that it implemented the new software \u201clast fall.\u201d  But Apple said that it would need six months to verify that the fix will satisfy regulators and to sell its existing inventory. Apple asked the full commission to delay any possible import ban by that long if the commission reverses the judge\u2019s decisions.  In a filing late on Friday, Qualcomm argued that Apple\u2019s disclosure of a fix undermined the reasoning in Pender\u2019s decision and that the Intel-chipped phones should be banned while Apple deploys its fix.  \u201cPender recommended against a remedy on the assumption that the (Qualcomm) patent would preclude Apple from using Intel as a supplier for many years and that no redesign was feasible,\u201d Qualcomm wrote. \u201cApple now admits\u2014more than seven months after the hearing\u2014that the alleged harm is entirely avoidable.\u201d","1464":"FILE PHOTO: Apple logo is seen on the Macbook in this illustration taken taken April 12, 2020.

The Google Pixel 3 third generation smartphones are seen on display after a news conference in Manhattan, New York, U.S., October 9, 2018. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  The company\u2019s Android software has gone from being an also-ran to the brains of most of the world\u2019s smartphones and Google topped Amazon.com Inc in smart speaker sales in recent quarters.  Pixel phones, though, have been a tougher sell, launching with glitches and garnering less than 1 percent of the global market by shipments in Google\u2019s first two years of trying, according to research firm Strategy Analytics.  The Pixel 3, priced at $799, and a larger Pixel 3 XL, priced at $899, mark Google\u2019s latest entries for a phone lineup it hopes will someday be as popular as Apple Inc\u2019s iPhone.  The Pixel Slate tablet runs Google\u2019s beefier Chrome OS laptop operating system rather than Android. It is priced at $599, aimed at competing with Apple\u2019s iPad Pro.  Shares of Alphabet barely moved on the announcements. Financial analysts said it is difficult to evaluate Google\u2019s hardware business as it is overshadowed by profits from search ads.  Google branched into hardware three years ago so that, like Apple, it could have full control of the performance of its applications and the revenue they generate. Other phone makers sometimes crowd out Google\u2019s apps with their own or take a share of ad revenue, hurting Alphabet\u2019s profits.  Expanding geographic distribution should provide a small boost to the Pixel line-up. The Pixel 3 will launch in 10 countries, up from six for the Pixel 2 a year ago. New additions include France, Ireland, Japan and Taiwan.  The Slate is available in the United States, the U.K. and Canada.  Slideshow ( 13 images )  A new artificial intelligence tool sure to generate buzz among consumers also could be helpful. The software, launching on U.S. Pixels only, answers calls, requests information about the nature of the calls and shares it as text with the recipient.  \u201cWe\u2019ve built the first phone that can answer the phone,\u201d Rick Osterloh, Google\u2019s senior vice president for hardware, told media on Tuesday.  Ryan Reith, who leads device research at tech consulting firm IDC, said Google did not change enough in the Pixel 3 for it to stand apart from more well-known competitors.  \u201cSome of the stuff they are doing with software and artificial intelligence is certainly leading edge,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as a lot of the technology advancements become more naked to the eye, it becomes that much tougher to sell.\u201d  Google shipped 2.53 million Pixel 2 and 2 XL devices through the nine months ended June 30, Strategy Analytics said. The first Pixel devices hit 2.4 million shipments in the nine months ended June 30, 2017, the firm said.  Limited adoption has reflected Google\u2019s hesitancy to go as wide and big in distributing and marketing the Pixel as Apple, which launched its last two iPhone line-ups in about 50 countries.  Going from a small experiment to a polished product that works in various languages and is backed by large sales, support and technical teams has been part of Google\u2019s challenge.  Last year\u2019s Pixel 2 arrived with bugs that prompted user complaints about unwanted noises during calls, a crashing camera app and an unexpected screen tint. In response, Google doubled warranties to two years.  The Pixel 3 faces continued limited sales in the United States since Google again signed an exclusive distribution deal with wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc that means the device will get little marketing from other carriers.  Google said it would augment distribution by opening two temporary stores in popular neighborhoods of Chicago and New York on Oct. 18 and putting up displays at U.S. tech retailer B8ta and Goop.  Google\u2019s new smart speaker, which has a display to show visual responses to voice commands, mostly matches offerings from Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc.  Unlike its competitors, Google said its Home Hub, priced at $149, does not have a video conferencing camera. Home Hub is launching in the United States, the U.K. and Australia.  The nod to privacy concerns comes as Google and other big U.S. tech companies try to bounce back from recent data breach scandals.  Amazon shipped 21.5 million smart speakers, including those with displays, in the year ended June 30, compared with 18.3 million for Google, according to research firm Canalys.

The conflict is but one aspect of the global legal battle between regulators, Apple and Qualcomm, which supplies modem chips that help phones connect to wireless data networks.  Last week, Qualcomm secured a preliminary victory in a patent lawsuit in China that forced Apple to change its software for iPhones in that country or else face a ban on selling phones there.  But Qualcomm was also handed another setback in an antitrust lawsuit brought against it by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission when a judge said it will not be able to mention that Apple ditched Qualcomm chips for competing ones from Intel Corp when the case goes to trial next month.  The group of contract manufacturers - which includes Foxconn parent Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, Pegatron Corp, Wistron Corp and Compal Electronics Inc - became embroiled in the dispute between Apple and Qualcomm last year.  In the supply chain for electronics, it is the contract manufacturers who buy Qualcomm\u2019s chips and pay royalties when they build phones, and they are in turn reimbursed by companies like Apple. Qualcomm sued the group last year, alleging they had stopped paying royalties related to Apple products, and Apple joined their defense.  The contract manufacturers have since filed claims of their own against Qualcomm, alleging the San Diego company\u2019s practice of charging money for chips but then also asking for a cut of the adjusted selling price of a mobile phone as a patent royalty payment constitutes an anticompetitive business practice. The manufacturers are seeking $9 billion in damages from Qualcomm for royalties they allege were illegal. That figure could triple if the manufacturers succeed on their antitrust claims.  Ted Boutrous, a high-profile partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP who is representing the contract manufacturers, said statements from Qualcomm executives suggesting there were meaningful settlement talks with the contract manufacturers were \u201cfalse.\u201d  \u201cTo the extent Qualcomm has indicated there have been licensing discussions with the contract manufacturers, they\u2019ve basically made the same sort of unreasonable demands that got them to where they are right now, which impose significant preconditions to even discuss a new arrangement,\u201d Boutrous told Reuters on Sunday.  In July, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, told investors on the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call that Qualcomm and Apple itself were in talks to resolve the litigation. Last month, a source familiar with Apple\u2019s legal strategy told Reuters there were \u201cabsolutely no meaningful discussion taking place between us and Qualcomm, and there is no settlement in sight.\u201d (Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; editing by Chris Reese)","1471":"FILE PHOTO - A police officer is silhouetted against the Apple logo in Grand Central Terminal in the Manhattan borough of New York January 13, 2015.

The tech firm said in a filing with state regulators that it planned to lay off people from eight different Santa Clara County facilities near its Cupertino, California, headquarters, as of April 16. A company spokesman confirmed that the reduction was from the self-driving car program.  While the iPhone maker has acknowledged its interest in self-driving cars in broad terms, it has never detailed precisely which technologies it is working on and whether it seeks to build a whole vehicle or the sensors, computer system and software to control one.  The public documents filed with regulators provide some previously undisclosed clues.  Among those laid off were at least two dozen software engineers, including a machine learning engineer, and 40 hardware engineers, according to a letter sent by Apple to California employment regulators earlier this month.  Some of the positions hint at physical products for consumers: three product design engineers and an ergonomics engineer face layoffs. A machine shop supervisor was among the reductions, though it is unclear how many machinists reported to the supervisor and whether the shop fabricates automotive parts or smaller parts for electronics and sensors.  The layoffs appear to be the first major shake-up of Project Titan under Doug Field, who returned to Apple last year as Vice President of Special Projects after a stint at electric car maker Tesla Inc.  Apple operates the car project on a \u201cneed-to-know\u201d basis, with only about 5,000 of Apple\u2019s 140,000 full-time workers included, according to court documents in a theft of trade secrets criminal case filed this year against an ex-Apple employee.  About 1,200 of those are \u201ccore\u201d employees that are \u201cdirectly working on the development of the project,\u201d according to the complaint, which was unsealed in January.  Despite the headcount changes, the company appears to have ramped up its testing on California roads. In a filing with regulators earlier this month, Apple said it had logged nearly 80,000 miles of testing in its home state in 2018, far surpassing the less than 1,000 miles it had logged the year before.  It was, however, far fewer than Alphabet Inc\u2019s Waymo unit, which logged 1.2 million miles in California last year.

Apple announced the card in March, aiming to draw in iPhone owners by offering a card with 2% cash back on purchases with the Apple Pay service, no fees, an app to manage related finances, and a focus on data privacy.  For Goldman, the issuing bank, the card builds on a foray into its Marcus consumer banking brand, started in 2015.  Apple said a limited number of consumers who expressed interest in the card will start to receive sign-up invitations on Tuesday.  The card is designed to work with the iPhone, where users sign up for the card and can start using it immediately if approved via the Apple Wallet app and Apple Pay system.  Apple offers an option for a physical card made of titanium, but the physical card has no visible number. Instead, the card\u2019s number is stored on a secure chip inside the iPhone, which generates virtual numbers for online or over-the-phone purchases requiring a number.  Apple has focused on privacy, saying that purchase information is stored on the user\u2019s iPhone and that it cannot see the information. Goldman will not be allowed to use data for marketing purposes, even for selling other Goldman products.  Gene Munster, managing partner with Loup Ventures and a longtime Apple watcher, said Apple Card adoption is likely to be low in the first year, but that Apple Card could generate about $1.4 billion of high-margin revenue by 2023, adding about 1.8% to Apple\u2019s overall earnings and complementing the much larger Apple Pay business for total payments revenue of $5.38 billion by 2023. Apple has roughly 50 million U.S. Apple Pay users now.  But at Apple\u2019s size - $265.6 billion in sales for fiscal 2018 - the revenue matters less than the effect on keeping Apple customers tied to its brand, analysts said, said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies.  \u201cIf it works, it\u2019s one more thing that causes you to stay deeply loyal and entrenched in the Apple ecosystem, even if something better comes along,\u201d he said (Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; editing by Greg Mitchell, Peter Henderson and Sandra Maler)","1475":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc iPhone sales in China fell 20 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2018, while sales for smartphones made by home-grown rival Huawei soared by 23 percent, data from industry research firm IDC showed on Monday.

Shares of Qualcomm jumped 23 percent to $70.45 in regular trading, their biggest gain in more than 19 years, then hit $75.25 in after-hours trading.  Intel Corp, which had been Apple\u2019s sole iPhone chip supplier for the past year amid intensifying conflict with Qualcomm, said hours after the settlement was announced that it would exit the modem chip business.  The Qualcomm settlement also incorporates a six-year patent license and a payment from Apple to Qualcomm, but the companies did not disclose the amount.  Because Qualcomm is already shipping 5G chips while Intel was still developing them, the deal helps Apple in its battle with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and other manufacturers whose phones already work on the faster networks.  \u201cThis is a big win\u201d for Qualcomm, said Christopher Rolland, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group.  The settlement followed two years of increasingly bitter legal battles between the two companies and came as opening arguments took place at a trial in federal court in San Diego.  Intel said Tuesday it was exiting the phone modem business and would focus its 5G efforts on other devices such as networking gear.  Shares of Intel were up 2.7 percent at $58.25 in after hours trade. Apple was barely changed after hours.  \u201cIntel isn\u2019t trading lower because modems represent such a small portion of revenues for the company,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy.  The deal could help Qualcomm return to the preeminent position it held in the early 2010s when it dominated the transition to 4G mobile networks and expanded revenues dramatically.  Apple had accused Qualcomm of using illegal patent practices to keep a monopoly on modem chips that connect phones to mobile data networks. Qualcomm had said Apple was using its technology without paying for it.  Qualcomm and Apple did not say when their new supply agreement would start. Because Intel does not expect to have a 5G chip ready for phones until next year, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said Apple is most likely tapping Qualcomm for its 5G chip.  FILE PHOTO: An employee of German Apple retailer Gravis displays an iPhone 7 and 8 in a store in Berlin, Germany, January 3, 2019. REUTERS\/Fabrizio Bensch\/File Photo  Intel\u2019s exit from the modem business does not necessarily mean Qualcomm will become Apple\u2019s sole supplier. Apple executives testified in January at a trial between the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Qualcomm that Apple\u2019s policy is always seek several suppliers.  Moreover, during the FTC trial Apple executives disclosed they had held talks with Samsung and MediaTek Inc about possibly using their 5G modems for 2019 iPhones.  Apple this year also moved its modem engineering efforts into the same group that makes its proprietary chips, signaling that the iPhone maker is also seriously pursuing its own modem.  BOOST TO EARNINGS  Qualcomm said the arrangements are expected to generate $2 per share in additional earnings, though analysts cautioned it was not clear how much of that was coming from the license deal versus the supply agreement.  Analysts were also unsure whether Apple\u2019s a onetime payment under the deal represented unpaid royalties from the past two years or a down payment on future royalties.  The settlement could also have an impact on China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, which is also in a licensing dispute with Qualcomm. Analysts widely believe that Huawei was watching the outcome of the Apple case to gauge its bargaining position.  Finally, the U.S. FTC case against Qualcomm that makes many of the same claims of anticompetitive behavior remains unresolved, with a decision expected at any time.  A jury of six men and three women was in the process of hearing opening arguments from Apple and Qualcomm when news of the settlement broke.  In addition to the federal lawsuit, the companies had lodged litigation in dozens of jurisdictions around the world, including Qualcomm efforts to ban iPhone sales in Germany and China and a state court case in San Diego where Qualcomm accused Apple of helping steal its chip secrets to benefit Intel.  Apple filed a $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm in January 2017, accusing the chipmaker of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates.  Later Qualcomm hit back with its own lawsuit, alleging that Apple used its heft in the electronics business to wrongly order contract factories such as Hon Hai Precision Co Ltd\u2019s Foxconn to withhold royalty payments from Qualcomm that Apple had historically reimbursed to the factories.  As part of the settlement, Qualcomm will also end litigation with Apple\u2019s contract manufacturers.  Intel did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.","1482":"FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc. logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, New York, U.S., October 16, 2019. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  (Reuters) - A group of European digital advertising associations on Friday criticized Apple Inc's AAPL.O plans to require apps to seek additional permission from users before tracking them across other apps and websites.  Apple last week disclosed features in its forthcoming operating system for iPhones and iPads that will require apps to show a pop-up screen before they enable a form of tracking commonly needed to show personalized ads.  Sixteen marketing associations, some of which are backed by Facebook Inc FB.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, faulted Apple for not adhering to an ad-industry system for seeking user consent under European privacy rules. Apps will now need to ask for permission twice, increasing the risk users will refuse, the associations argued.  Facebook and Google are the largest among thousands of companies that track online consumers to pick up on their habits and interests and serve them relevant ads.  Apple said the new feature was aimed at giving users greater transparency over how their information is being used. In training sessions at a developer conference last week, Apple showed that developers can present any number of additional screens beforehand to explain why permission is needed before triggering its pop-up.  The pop-up says an app \u201cwould like permission to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies\u201d and gives the app developer several lines below the main text to explain why the permission is sought. It is not required until an app seeks access to a numeric identifier that can be used for tracking, and apps only need to secure permission once.  The group of European marketing firms said the pop-up warning and the limited ability to customize it still carries \u201ca high risk of user refusal.\u201d  Apple engineers also said last week the company will bolster a free Apple-made tool that uses anonymous, aggregated data to measure whether advertising campaigns are working and that will not trigger the pop-up.  \u201cBecause it\u2019s engineered to not track users, there\u2019s no need to request permission to track,\u201d Brandon Van Ryswyk, an Apple privacy engineer, said in a video session explaining the measurement tool to developers.","1483":"Feb 27 (Reuters) - Apple Inc said on Wednesday it plans to lay off 190 employees in its self-driving car program, Project Titan.

Apple\u2019s fourth-quarter revenue drop and the ensuing sell-off in global equities suggested that an economic slowdown in China was worse than many expected, casting a shadow over the outlook for corporate profit growth this year.  The yield on Germany\u2019s 10-year government bond hit its lowest in over two years on Wednesday as investors began pricing in much less chance the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserves would raise interest rates. Business surveys in China and the euro zone underlined worries about global growth.  Germany\u2019s 10-year bond yield was most recently at 0.177 percent, up about half a basis point on the day, from a low of 0.148 percent earlier in the session. Other high- grade euro zone bond yields also turned positive, having started the session lower.,.  \u201cThe market is pushing back even further the rate hike for the European Central Bank, now to the middle of 2020, and this is backed up by the latest run of data,\u201d said Rainer Guntermann, rates strategist at Commerzbank.  Money markets are now pricing in less than a 30 percent chance of a 10-basis-point rate increase in 2019.  Guntermann said he did not expect the rally to continue, but said the downside risk of weak data would not lead to an \u201cimminent reversal\u201d in bund yields.  In the periphery, Italian government bond yields rose the most, gaining 12 basis points. Portugese and Spanish yields were up to three basis points higher.  Analysts said the rise in Italian yields was caused by several factors, including the equity-led weakness, a Spanish bond auction and improving liquidity.  \u201cThe past few sessions have been very low liquidity and that is now picking up,\u201d said Jan von Gerich, rates strategist at Nordea. \u201cThe euro area is struggling even more than it looked, and Italy should suffer more.\u201d  Italy\u2019s 10-year government bond yield was on track for its biggest one day rise in almost a month, up 13 basis points on the day to 2.817 percent, though still far off the mid-November highs of 3.71 percent.  Analysts are also looking to Italian preliminary inflation data on Friday for evidence as to the rate of Italian growth.  \u201cIf we see another contractory print, it would underline the significant possibility that GDP growth was negative in Q4, which means Italy was in recession of the second half of last year,\u201d said Richard McGuire, rates strategist at Rabobank.

Samsung Display, the panel-making unit of Samsung Electronics, now plans to make OLED panels for 20 million or fewer iPhones at the South Chungcheong plant in the January-March quarter, significantly lower than its initial goal of supplying panels for 45 million to 50 million iPhones, the Nikkei reported.

Samsung Display has yet to set a production target for the April-June period, but a further cutback is possible, the Nikkei reported, without citing sources.  A spokesman for Samsung Display declined to comment.  Apple will halve its iPhone X production target for the first three months of the year to around 20 million units, the Nikkei reported last month, adding to growing concerns about weak sales of the $999 phone.  The iPhone X was the first phone to get a major design overhaul since the launch of the iPhone 6 in 2015, and many expected it to lead to blockbuster sales.","1487":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc has held talks with iHeartMedia Inc to take a stake in the U.S. radio company, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The Omaha, Nebraska-based financial firm said on Tuesday it was allowing customers to fund their accounts with a debit card in their Apple Pay digital wallets. Using the wallet and a system called Apple Business Chat, TD Ameritrade customers with Apple devices can transfer up to $10,000 a day to their accounts and have access to it immediately, a feature the brokerage says is a first in its industry.  Apple confirmed the arrangement.  Previously, customers had to either use a wire transfer, which can be complex, or wait for several days before being able to access transferred funds. Sunayna Tuteja, head of strategic partnerships and emerging technologies at TD Ameritrade, said the wait was one of the top-five drivers of customer service calls.  \u201cWhen a customer wants to put money into a TD Ameritrade account, we gave them the same choices they had in the 1970s and 1980s,\u201d she said. \u201cWe knew it was a persistent client irritant.\u201d  The key, Tuteja said, was accepting debit cards to handle funding the accounts.  Many consumer transfers still happen over the so-called Automated Clearing House, or ACH, system, which traditionally took several days to clear. While the group that oversees the ACH system has worked to speed it up, debit card infrastructure in the U.S. provides nearly instant payments and is widely used.  But TD Ameritrade had not been sure debit cards complied with all the legal rules around funding brokerage accounts.  \u201cThere was a myth that we could never do this because cards are a no-no,\u201d Tuteja said. The firm\u2019s regulatory experts \u201clocked themselves in a room for two or three days and read through every regulatory document to see what is doable, and the only real no-no is credit cards.\u201d  Tuteja said TD Ameritrade chose Apple Pay to start with because of its ease of use, security and the fact that about three-quarters of the brokerage\u2019s clients use the iOS operating system. In the future, the brokerage hopes to extend the system to other digital wallets, such as those offered by Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google or Tencent Holdings Ltd\u2019s WeChat.  \u201cAll the regulatory work we did, and all of the back-end work, all of that is built in a way we can extend it,\u201d she said.","1489":"(Reuters) - Arm Ltd, the semiconductor firm owned by Japan\u2019s Softbank Group Corp, on Tuesday released new technology aimed at helping Android devices catch up to Apple Inc\u2019s iPhones for certain computing tasks such as video games.  Arm\u2019s technology powers the processors in both iPhones and Android devices. But Apple extensively customizes what are called computing \u201ccores\u201d on its chips, while many Android devices hew more closely to designs developed and sold by Arm itself.  In recent years, mobile phones have used a mix of high-performance cores that are speedy at computing but drain a phone\u2019s battery and power-efficient cores that are slower but preserve battery.  Apple\u2019s iPhones, however, are believed to have at least one high-performance core that is larger than others, helping it beat out Android competitors\u2019 peak speeds on single-threaded computing tasks. That can help with video games, web scrolling and faster app launches.  Arm on Tuesday announced a new design called the Cortex-X1. Paul Williamson, the vice president and general manager of the client line of business at Arm, said the company will work with the chip suppliers to high-end Android phones to provide cores that are capable of giving a boost of performance, even if it burns a bit of battery power.  He said Arm will also give game developers tools to take advantage of the new computing power when they make apps for Android devices.  \u201cWe\u2019re lifting off the constraints around efficiency,\u201d Williamson told Reuters in an interview. \u201cThis is a bit like the AMG tuning shop for Mercedes engines.\u201d","1490":"BERLIN (Reuters) - Apple has become embroiled in a publishing row in Germany after it tried to halt sales of a book written by a former executive, saying it disclosed secrets about the App Store.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  \u2018App Store Confidential\u2019, by self-styled German rapper, ski instructor and marketing manager Tom Sadowski, is part autobiography and part self-help guide for Generation Z readers looking to navigate their way into the tech scene.  Until late last year, Sadowski was the head of Apple App Store in Germany. After his book was published in Germany this week, Apple wrote to Hamburg publishers Murmann Verlag demanding a halt to sales and a recall of copies already sold, according to extracts of a letter shared with Reuters by Murmann\u2019s lawyer Ralph Oliver Graef.  \u201cThe operation of the App Store encompasses a multitude of business secrets,\u201d the iPhone maker said in its letter.  Yet, apart from a brief account of a visit by CEO Tim Cook to Berlin and tips on how app developers should pitch their wares to Apple, the book betrays few - if any - details over how the $1.4 trillion U.S. company does business.  \u201cApple is trying to obstruct the publication of a book that addresses its business practices, but is written very sympathetically,\u201d Graef said.  Murmann said a first print run of 4,000 copies was selling well and, rather than pulling the book, it was rushing out a second print run. \u201cIt\u2019s No. 2 on the Amazon best-seller list in Germany - everyone is talking about it,\u201d said Peter Felixberger, an executive at Murmann.  Apple, meanwhile, has not yet sought a court injunction on sales of the book. \u201cIt looks like Apple has gone a bit far tactically, building up pressure and issuing threats but then lacking the courage actually to go to court,\u201d Graef said.  Apple said it had fired Sadowski for writing the book, although Sadowski said he left Apple last November and that his plans to publish the book only became known in December.  PUBLICLY AVAILABLE  The 180-page book states at the outset that all the facts it contains are publicly available.  It then embarks on a chatty account of how Sadowski landed a job in 2010 at Apple to market its iTunes music service, before moving to become head of the App Store for Germany, Austria and Switzerland, a role he held from 2014 until he left the company.  Each chapter of Sadowski\u2019s book opens with words of wisdom from Apple\u2019s late founder, Steve Jobs, while the text is anything but revelatory. One highlight, the account of Cook\u2019s visit to a Berlin startup in 2017, contains no details of what was said at the meeting.  Sadowski said that a manuscript of his book was submitted to Apple in January.  \u201cI really enjoyed working for Apple ... I never had any intention of betraying any secrets or harming Apple, as anyone who has read the book will tell you,\u201d Sadowski said in a written reply to a Reuters request for comment.  \u201cBut I also believe in the freedom of the press and freedom of speech and that every person and every company is equal before the law, and therefore I resist Apple\u2019s demands.\u201d  Graef said powerful companies like Apple ought not to be untouchable and should accept reporting about their business practices, referring to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling dating back to 1882 that no man should be above the law.  Apple said in a statement on Thursday that while it promoted a free press and supported authors, it had been left with no alternative but to terminate Sadowski over his first foray into book writing.  \u201cAll workers should have the reasonable expectation that employment policies will be equally and fairly applied and all companies should have the reasonable expectation that their business practices will be kept confidential,\u201d Apple said.  It declined further comment on the circumstances of Sadowski\u2019s departure.  Murmann, a 15-year-old publisher, specialises in issues like the impact of digital technology on society and environmental affairs.","1491":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window.)  * Medtronic up on improving demand for medical devices  * Best Buy warns of slowing sales growth, shares fall  * U.S. consumer confidence hits six-year low  * Indexes: Dow dips 0.43%, S&P flat, Nasdaq up 0.21% (Adds comment, details; updates prices)  Aug 25 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 was little changed on Tuesday following a three-day rally as a drop in Apple shares overshadowed optimism from remarks made by U.S. and China officials in pledging firm commitment to a Phase One trade deal.

While President Donald Trump would meet China President Xi Jinping later this month, he has not asked U.S. officials to draw up a proposed trade plan, Kudlow told CNBC, contradicting a report earlier in the day that had buoyed hopes of a trade dispute resolution.  The trade-sensitive industrial sector, which was up as much as 1.13 percent earlier, dropped 0.59 percent to its session low.  Apple Inc tumbled 7.3 percent, taking its market value below $1 trillion, after the iPhone maker warned sales for the crucial holiday quarter may miss expectations.  That dragged down shares of its U.S. suppliers, mostly chipmakers, and pushed the S&P technology sector 2.66 percent lower, putting it on track to snap a three-day rally.  \u201cInvestors are looking at risk on, but they are doing it in a cautionary approach. They aren\u2019t rushing back into big FAANG type names,\u201d said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.  \u201cIt\u2019s something to watch, because you need those names to participate in the overall market if it\u2019s going to move much higher as they are big dollar prices.\u201d  At 13:00 ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 261.57 points, or 1.03 percent, at 25,119.17, the S&P 500 was down 35.75 points, or 1.30 percent, at 2,704.62 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 124.06 points, or 1.67 percent, at 7,310.00.  Economic data was healthy, with the Labor Department\u2019s closely watched report showing job growth rebounded sharply in October, pointing to further labor market tightening that could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise rates in December.  Apple aside, most earnings reports were strong.  Chevron Corp gained 2.2 percent after reporting its quarterly profit doubled on record oil and gas production.  Starbucks Corp jumped as much as 8.5 percent to a record high after the coffee chain reported strong sales in the United States and China.  \u201cYou have other areas of the market that are acting well, but not well enough to counterbalance the effects of Apple today,\u201d SlateStone Wealth\u2019s Pavlik said.  Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.84-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.29-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The proposal highlighted Apple's 2017 removal here of virtual private network apps from its App Store in China. Such apps allow users to bypass China\u2019s so-called Great Firewall aimed at restricting access to overseas sites, and Apple's action was seen as a step to preserve access to the country's vast market.  Wednesday\u2019s vote stood in contrast to previous years when critics made little headway with big investors on the issue.  \u201cA total this high is a striking warning \u2014 and it must have come from big institutional investors, not just retail shareholders \u2014 that Apple\u2019s human rights policy in China has become a material risk for the company\u2019s reputation,\u201d said Stephen Davis, a senior fellow at Harvard Law School\u2019s Program on Corporate Governance.  \u201cApple will be under great pressure to respond rather than ignore this vote,\u201d Davis said.  An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the results. Apple had opposed the proposal, saying it already provides extensive information about when it takes down apps at the request of governments around the world and that it follows the laws in countries where it operates.  SumOfUs, the group that put the measure on the ballot, celebrated the totals.  \u201cApple\u2019s investors have sounded the alarm that Tim Cook needs to listen to the concerns raised by frontline communities such as Tibetans and Uighurs who have long suffered under a tech dystopia,\u201d said Sondhya Gupta, a campaign manager for the group.  Cook is Apple\u2019s chief executive.  In the past, Apple shareholders have voted down human rights measures related to China by much larger margins. A 2018 proposal here' that urged Apple to create a human rights panel to oversee issues such as workplace conditions and censorship in China was defeated, with 94.4% of votes cast against it.  Sentiment appears to have shifted, experts said.  \u201cGiven the high level of support received for the proposal, we expect to see the company engage with its shareholders on the issue and report to shareholders about what happened in the engagements, including any potential actions it intends to take as a result,\u201d said Kern McPherson, vice president of research and engagement for proxy advisory firm Glass, Lewis & Co, which supported the measure.  Apple has signaled it is considering action. In a letter earlier this month to Access Now, an open-internet advocacy group, Apple\u2019s senior privacy director, Jane Horvath, wrote: \u201cApple has and always will consider freedom of expression a fundamental human right.\u201d The company, she said, \u201cwill consider providing additional details on our commitment in the future.\u201d  The proposal was one of six topics to be voted on at Wednesday\u2019s shareholder meeting. By wide margins, shareholders approved Apple\u2019s executive pay, existing board of directors and the retention of Ernst & Young as its accounting firm, results that were widely expected.  A \u201cproxy access\u201d proposal to allow shareholders to nominate more than one director to Apple\u2019s board was defeated, with 68.9% of votes cast against.

Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange ended down 1.8 percent at $5,736 a tonne.  Prices of the metal used widely in power and construction earlier touched $5,725, the lowest since June 2017, as U.S. funds sold after the New York open on worries about growth in both China and the United States.

The Caixin\/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index for December fell to 49.7 from 50.2 in November, marking the first contraction since May 2017. Manufacturing is a key source of jobs in China\u2019s economy.  CONSUMPTION: China accounts for half of global copper consumption estimated at 24 million tonnes this year.  SUPPORT: China will ratchet up support for the economy this year by cutting taxes and keeping liquidity ample, the official Xinhua news agency said after an annual meeting of Chinese leaders and policymakers.  The government has launched a number of measures, including reductions in reserve requirements for banks, tax cuts and more infrastructure spending, to ward off sharp growth deceleration. Further policy steps are expected.  U.S. DATA: Traders said weaker than expected weekly jobs and manufacturing data from the United States helped fuel momentum for the copper price sell-off.

The EU investigations were prompted by a complaint by Swedish music streaming service Spotify and an e-book rival.

The group, led by campaigner Max Schrems, filed complaints with data protection watchdogs in Germany and Spain alleging that the tracking tool illegally enabled the $2 trillion U.S. tech giant to store users\u2019 data without their consent.  Apple directly rebutted the claims filed by Noyb, the digital rights group founded by Schrems, saying they were \u201cfactually inaccurate and we look forward to making that clear to privacy regulators should they examine the complaint\u201d.  Schrems is a prominent figure in Europe\u2019s digital rights movement that has resisted intrusive data-gathering by Silicon Valley\u2019s tech platforms. He has fought two cases against Facebook, winning landmark judgments that forced the social network to change how it handles user data.  Noyb\u2019s complaints were brought against Apple\u2019s use of a tracking code, known as the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), that is automatically generated on every iPhone when it is set up.  The code, stored on the device, makes it possible to track a user\u2019s online behaviour and consumption preferences - vital in allowing companies to send targeted adverts.  \u201cApple places codes that are comparable to a cookie in its phones without any consent by the user. This is a clear breach of European Union privacy laws,\u201d Noyb lawyer Stefano Rossetti said.

REUTERS\/Lisi Niesner  Rossetti referred to the EU\u2019s e-Privacy Directive, which requires a user\u2019s consent before installation and using such information.  NO ACCESS  Apple said in response that it \u201cdoes not access or use the IDFA on a user\u2019s device for any purpose\u201d.  It said its aim was to protect the privacy of its users and that the latest release of its iOS 14 operating system gave users greater control over whether apps could link with third parties for the purposes of targeted advertising.  The Californian tech giant said in September it would delay plans to launch iOS 14 until early next year.  Apple accounts for one in every four smartphones sold in Europe, according to Counterpoint Research.  The claims were made on behalf of a German and a Spanish consumer and handed to the Spanish data protection authority and its counterpart in Berlin, said Noyb.  Spain\u2019s privacy protection agency confirmed it received a complaint from Noyb against Apple but declined to comment.  The Berlin agency had no comment. In Germany, each federal state has its own data protection authority.  Noyb said its claims were based on the 2002 e-Privacy Directive that allows national authorities to impose fines autonomously, avoiding lengthy proceedings it faced in its case against Facebook that was based on the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  The GDPR regime launched in 2018 included a mandatory cooperation mechanism among national authorities, which Noyb says has slowed progress.  Rossetti said the action aimed to establish a clear principle that \u201ctracking must be the exception, not the rule\u201d.

Intel made the claims in a brief filed with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where Qualcomm is seeking to overturn a sweeping antitrust decision against it after losing a lawsuit by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Intel, whose executives testified at the trial, argued on Friday that the ruling should stand. Appeal proceedings are expected to begin in January.  In a 233-page decision issued in May, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose wrote that Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing practices \u201cstrangled competition\u201d in parts of the market for modem chips that connect smartphones to mobile data networks. She ordered the San Diego-based company to renegotiate licensing agreements at reasonable prices.  Qualcomm appealed Koh\u2019s ruling and won a pause in enforcement while the appeal unfolds.  Intel was Qualcomm\u2019s chief rival in modem chips, and sold the components to Apple for the iPhone. But Apple signed a chip supply agreement with Qualcomm after they settled a major legal battle in May. Hours later, Santa Clara, California-based Intel said it would sell its modem chip business.  In July, Apple bought the Intel unit in deal valued at $1 billion.  In its court filing and an accompanying blog post published on Friday, Intel said it was forced out of the market because of Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing practices and supported the FTC\u2019s case against Qualcomm.  \u201cWe invested billions, hired thousands, acquired two companies and built innovative world-class products that eventually made their way into Apple\u2019s industry-leading iPhones, including the most recently released iPhone 11,\u201d Steven R.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The company\u2019s shares, which closed up 23 percent on Tuesday after the announcement, rose as much as 17 percent on Wednesday, hitting their highest in nearly two decades.  The deal with Apple, coming at the cusp of the rollout of high-speed 5G network, could help Qualcomm return to the preeminent position it held in the early 2010s when it dominated the transition to 4G mobile networks and expanded revenues dramatically.  Qualcomm\u2019s fortunes are also looking up since Intel Corp, which had been Apple\u2019s sole iPhone chip supplier for the past year, decided to exit the modem chip business following Qualcomm\u2019s settlement with Apple.  \u201cIn the US, around 5G it\u2019s Qualcomm\u2019s world and everyone else is just paying rent,\u201d said Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.  \u201cThis was a game changing settlement for Qualcomm and was also a smart move by Apple to clear this noise and focus on 5G smartphones for 2020.\u201d  Wall Street analysts scrambled to raise their recommendations and price targets on Qualcomm\u2019s stock following the settlement.  At least three brokerages raised their ratings and nine ratcheted up their price targets. Stifel made the most aggressive move by raising its target by $43 to $100 - well above the median price target of $75.85.  Of the 25 brokerages covering the stock, 14 rate it \u201cbuy\u201d or higher and the rest have a \u201chold\u201d rating, according to Refinitiv data.  Bond investors also joined in, with Qualcomm\u2019s 4.3 percent 2047 issuance becoming one of the most heavily traded bonds in the U.S. corporate space on Wednesday, according to capital markets publication IFR.  The company could make $2 billion annually by taking Intel\u2019s market share and regain the dominant position it enjoyed during the rollout of 4G, analysts said.  The settlement also helps Apple close the gap with rivals such as South Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics Co and Huawei in delivering a 5G phone.  Both Apple and Huawei had been at odds with Qualcomm over patents and royalties over modems. While Qualcomm did not close the terms of the deal, analysts estimated that Apple withheld $5 billion, or about $2 per share, under its previous royalty payment agreement.  \u201cWe now expect an imminent settlement with Huawei which has also been withholding royalty payments, which we estimate will add another $0.50-$0.75 of EPS,\u201d Cowen and Company analysts said.

Qualcomm, the world\u2019s biggest supplier of mobile chips, sued Apple in Germany alleging that some older iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models violated Qualcomm patents around so-called envelope tracking, a feature that helps mobile phones save battery power while sending and receiving wireless signals. The alleged patent violation stemmed not from Intel chips but yet another Apple supplier - Qorvo Inc - whose chip was only present in older phones with Intel modems.  The court sided with Qualcomm and banned sales of some iPhone models that used Intel modem chips, leading Apple to pull the devices from its 15 retail stories in Germany and its online store in the country.  The ban was a victory in Qualcomm\u2019s legal conflict with Apple.  The iPhone maker has alleged that Qualcomm engaged in illegal patent licensing practices to protect a monopoly on so-called modem chips, which connect mobile phones to wireless data networks. Qualcomm has in turn alleged that Apple has infringed its patents. A major case between the two goes to trial in the United States in April.  Apple began phasing in Intel\u2019s modem chips in 2016 after years of using chips exclusively from Qualcomm. In last year\u2019s iPhone models, Apple dropped Qualcomm\u2019s chips completely in favor of Intel\u2019s.  But Qualcomm has continued to supply Apple with chips for older models, and Apple on Thursday said it would use only those for German iPhone 7 and 8 models.  \u201cQualcomm is attempting to use injunctions against our products to try to get Apple to succumb to their extortionist demands,\u201d Apple said in a statement to Reuters.  Qualcomm and Qorvo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Newer iPhones with Intel chips remain on sale in Germany.  \u201cIntel\u2019s modem products are not involved in this lawsuit and are not subject to this or any other injunction,\u201d Steven Rodgers, Intel\u2019s general counsel, said in a statement.","1519":"SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Amazon.com briefly became the most valuable company on Wall Street in intraday trade on Monday, days after Microsoft Corp dethroned long-time leader Apple.  Amazon rose as much as 4.7 percent, putting its market capitalization at $865.0 billion. Apple was up 2.1 percent, giving it a market capitalization of $864.8 billion.  Microsoft, which on Friday closed above Apple\u2019s market capitalization for the first time in eight years, was up 0.9 percent, leaving its stock market value at $859.0 billion, third in the group.  The tight race between the trio of high-powered technology stocks coincided with a broad stock market rally after the United States and China agreed on a temporary trade truce.  Apple in August became the first U.S. publicly-listed company to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization, but the iPhone maker has fallen sharply in recent months as investors worried that demand for iPhones was losing steam.  Amazon\u2019s stock has recovered most of the ground it lost after the online retailer in October forecast disappointing sales for the holiday quarter, but it is still down about 13 percent from its Sept. 4 record-high close.  Apple\u2019s market capitalization overtook Microsoft\u2019s in 2010 as Microsoft struggled with slow demand for personal computers, due in part to the explosion of smartphones like the iPhone.

Russia and Ukraine have both been highly sensitive to the way global companies identify Crimea, since Russian troops seized the territory and Moscow annexed it in March 2014 after a referendum that Kiev and its Western allies say was illegal.  Russian and Ukrainian embassies in the United States did not immediately return requests for comment on Friday.  Apple appeared to have changed the way it displays locations in Crimea in its software, in a nod to Russian politicians who have demanded the peninsula be referred to as part of Russia.  Reuters reporters in Moscow who typed the name of the Crimean provincial capital Simferopol into Apple\u2019s Maps and Weather apps on Wednesday saw it displayed as \u201cSimferopol, Crimea, Russia\u201d.

Intel shares closed down 6.1 percent at $48.92, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq .IXIC ended down 2.7 percent.  Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy said in a note he believed the market was \u201cover reacting\u201d to the report on Apple\u2019s plans and that Intel\u2019s prospects remained good. \u201cWe do not expect any other PC manufacturers will consider designing its own CPUs,\u201d he wrote in the note.  Other analysts said Apple would likely phase Intel\u2019s chips out over time.  \u201cWhile it\u2019s possible that Apple may replace Intel in some of its lower-end product lines, we think it will be difficult for Apple to completely replace Intel by 2020, especially on its higher-end offerings,\u201d said Summit Insights group analyst Kinngai Chan.  The Mac plays a small part in Apple\u2019s overall financial picture, with sales of 19.2 million units last year and accounting for 11 percent of Apple\u2019s $229.2 billion in revenue for fiscal 2017.  But while the laptop and desktop computer market has been in a years-long slump amid the rise of smartphones and tablet computers, Mac sales rose 4 percent in 2017. The growth came even as PC sales declined slightly to 259.5 million units, the smallest drop since 2011, according to data from research firm IDC.  While Apple\u2019s reported move away from Intel would be a major shift for its Mac lineup, it follows years of increasing focus on designing its own chips for its devices. The company has been designing its own iPhone processors since the release of the iPhone 4 in 2010 and has steadily increased the amount of chip work it handles itself.  \u201cWe can push the envelope on innovation.

First-quarter sales in China, reflecting that country\u2019s store closings and lockdown, were $9.46 billion, about $1 billion less than for the same period a year earlier.  Last week, Apple reopened its first five stores in the United States, requiring customers and employees to undergo temperature checks and wear masks before entering the premises.

In a report on supplier responsibility progress earlier this month it said it provides waste management training and has also introduced women\u2019s health programs at the existing Bengaluru plant.  Boosting local assembly or manufacturing will also help Apple cut escalating labor costs in China, where its biggest contract manufacturer Hon Hai Precision Industry Co 2317.TW, widely known as Foxconn, makes a bulk of iPhones and iPads.  Reuters reported in January that Wistron was weeks away from finalizing a land deal in Bengaluru and may soon begin assembly of another Apple model.

The filing came in a dispute between Apple and Epic Games. Apple removed Epic\u2019s titles from its App Store after the game maker violated the iPhone maker\u2019s in-app payment rules.  Epic says that Apple has also threatened to cut off its access to Apple tools needed to maintain \u201cUnreal Engine,\u201d software that many game developers license to create better graphics.

Apple has no way of tracking the real-time distribution of these certificates, or the spread of improperly modified apps on its phones, but it can cancel the certificates if it finds misuse.  \u201cDevelopers that abuse our enterprise certificates are in violation of the Apple Developer Enterprise Program Agreement and will have their certificates terminated, and if appropriate, they will be removed from our Developer Program completely,\u201d an Apple spokesperson told Reuters. \u201cWe are continuously evaluating the cases of misuse and are prepared to take immediate action.\u201d  A 3D printed Apple logo is seen in front of a displayed cyber code in this illustration taken March 22, 2016. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  After Reuters initially contacted Apple for comment last week, some of the pirates were banned from the system, but within days they were using different certificates and were operational again.  \u201cThere\u2019s nothing stopping these companies from doing this again from another team, another developer account,\u201d said Amine Hambaba, head of security at software firm Shape Security.  Apple confirmed a media report on Wednesday that it would require two-factor authentication - using a code sent to a phone as well as a password - to log into all developer accounts by the end of this month, which could help prevent certificate misuse.  Major app makers Spotify Technology SA, Rovio Entertainment Oyj and Niantic Inc have begun to fight back.  Spotify declined to comment on the matter of modified apps, but the streaming music provider did say earlier this month that its new terms of service would crack down on users who are \u201ccreating or distributing tools designed to block advertisements\u201d on its service.  Rovio, the maker of Angry Birds mobile games, said it actively works with partners to address infringement \u201cfor the benefit of both our player community and Rovio as a business.\u201d  Niantic, which makes Pokemon Go, said players who use pirated apps that enable cheating on its game are regularly banned for violating its terms of service. Microsoft Corp, which owns the creative building game Minecraft, declined to comment.  SIPHONING OFF REVENUE  It is unclear how much revenue the pirate distributors are siphoning away from Apple and legitimate app makers.  TutuApp offers a free version of Minecraft, which costs $6.99 in Apple\u2019s App Store. AppValley offers a version of Spotify\u2019s free streaming music service with the advertisements stripped away.  The distributors make money by charging $13 or more per year for subscriptions to what they calls \u201cVIP\u201d versions of their services, which they say are more stable than the free versions. It is impossible to know how many users buy such subscriptions, but the pirate distributors combined have more than 600,000 followers on Twitter.  Security researchers have long warned about the misuse of enterprise developer certificates, which act as digital keys that tell an iPhone a piece of software downloaded from the internet can be trusted and opened. They are the centerpiece of Apple\u2019s program for corporate apps and enable consumers to install apps onto iPhones without Apple\u2019s knowledge.  Apple last month briefly banned Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc from using enterprise certificates after they used them to distribute data-gathering apps to consumers.  The distributors of pirated apps seen by Reuters are using certificates obtained in the name of legitimate businesses, although it is unclear how. Several pirates have impersonated a subsidiary of China Mobile Ltd. China Mobile did not respond to requests for comment.  Tech news website TechCrunch earlier this week reported that certificate abuse also enabled the distribution of apps for pornography and gambling, both of which are banned from the App Store.  Since the App Store debuted in 2008, Apple has sought to portray the iPhone as safer than rival Android devices because Apple reviews and approves all apps distributed to the devices.  Early on, hackers \u201cjailbroke\u201d iPhones by modifying their software to evade Apple\u2019s controls, but that process voided the iPhone\u2019s warranty and scared off many casual users. The misuse of the enterprise certificates seen by Reuters does not rely on jailbreaking and can be used on unmodified iPhones.

In the past, Apple used Qualcomm\u2019s modem chips in its flagship iPhone models to help them connect to wireless data networks. But early last year, Apple sued Qualcomm in federal court in San Diego, alleging that the chip company\u2019s practice of taking a cut of the selling price of phones as a patent license fee was illegal.  Qualcomm denied the claims and has alleged that Apple owes it $7 billion in unpaid royalties.  The case is to go to trial early next year and has spawned related legal actions in other courts around the world. In July, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, told investors on the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call that the two companies were in talks to resolve the litigation.  \u201cWe continue to talk. We also have a number of ... legal strategies that are in flight,\u201d Mollenkopf said on the call. \u201cAnd we hope that through the combination of either those paths, we could get to a resolution, and we\u2019re confident that we will.\u201d  But a source familiar with the situation said this week that there are no settlement talks between Apple and Qualcomm.  \u201cThere is absolutely no meaningful discussion taking place between us and Qualcomm, and there is no settlement in sight,\u201d the person said. \u201cWe are gearing up for trial.\u201d  In addition to its dispute with Apple, Qualcomm is in a dispute with another phone maker, widely believed by analysts to be China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, that is withholding payments. But talks with Huawei appear to be progressing.  In July, Qualcomm received what its patent licensing chief, Alex Rogers, called a \u201cgood faith partial payment\u201d of $500 million from the non-paying phone maker, which Qualcomm executives said was a sign of progress in the talks. Qualcomm is slated to receive $200 million more in such payments, the executives have said.  Qualcomm is also trying to settle an antitrust lawsuit brought against it by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission days before Apple filed its lawsuit.  But that effort suffered a setback on Tuesday, when a federal judge in San Jose, California, issued a preliminary ruling saying that Qualcomm must license some patents involved in making modem chips to rivals such as Intel Corp, a move that could jeopardize Qualcomm\u2019s existing licensing practices.

The regional court in the city of Mannheim dismissed the Qualcomm suit as groundless in an initial verbal decision, saying the patent in question was not violated by the installation of its chips in Apple\u2019s smartphones.  Qualcomm, waging a worldwide patent battle with Apple, said it would appeal after winning a separate case before a court in Munich in December that enabled it to enforce a ban on the sale of older iPhones in Germany.  \u201cApple has a history of infringing our patents,\u201d said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm\u2019s executive vice president and general counsel.  \u201cWhile we disagree with the Mannheim court\u2019s decision and will appeal, we will continue to enforce our (intellectual property) rights against Apple worldwide.\u201d  Apple declined to comment on the Mannheim decision. It referred to a statement issued in response to the Dec. 20 ruling in Munich, against which it is appealing.  Apple said at the time that, while a decision on the Munich appeal is outstanding, it would no longer stock the iPhone 7 and 8 at its 15 retail outlets in Germany, although its newer models would remain on sale.  All of its models remain available through carriers and resellers. Gravis, the leading Apple reseller in Germany, said on Tuesday it continued to stock the full range of iPhones.  Apart from the German order, Qualcomm has also secured a ban on the sale of some iPhones in China. Apple, which is also contesting that ruling, has continued to offer its iPhones in China but made changes to its iOS operating system following the order.  Qualcomm, meanwhile, faces a U.S. antitrust case brought by the Federal Trade Commission which accuses it of abusing a monopoly on mobile chip technology in a trial that could have a major impact on the smartphone industry.  If the government prevails in the trial that began on Jan. 4, Qualcomm could be forced to change its practices for licensing a trove of patents to device makers like Apple.  Apple is closely watching the FTC case, as it has its own pending lawsuit making similar claims against Qualcomm.

But Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended his company\u2019s ad-based business model said users were aware of a trade-off for free services.  Cook, speaking at the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, said Apple would support a U.S. privacy law and also touted the iPhone maker\u2019s commitment to protect users\u2019 data and privacy.  Apple, which designs many of its products so that it cannot see users\u2019 data, has largely avoided the data privacy scandals that have enmeshed its rivals Google and Facebook this year.  \u201cThe desire to put profits over privacy is nothing new,\u201d Cook told a packed audience of privacy regulators, corporate executives and other participants.  Issues over how data is used and how consumers can protect their personal information are under the spotlight after big breaches of data privacy involving millions of internet and social media users in Europe and the United States.  Cook in his speech cited former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis who in a Harvard Law Review article in 1890 warned that gossip was no longer the resource of the idle and the vicious but had become a trade.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  \u201cToday that trade has exploded into a data industrial complex. Our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency,\u201d Cook said.  \u201cThese scraps of data ... each one harmless enough on its own ... are carefully assembled, synthesized, traded, and sold,\u201d Cook said.  \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t sugarcoat the consequences. This is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them,\u201d he said.  FACEBOOK\u2019S AD-BASED MODEL  Zuckerberg, speaking via video message, said Facebook users were aware of the trade-off between a free service and advertisements.  \u201cInstead of charging people, we charge advertisers to show ads. People consistently tell us that they want a free service and that if they going to see ads to get it, then they want those ads to be relevant,\u201d he said.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Facebook was investing heavily in both security and privacy even as this impacts on its profitability, Zuckerberg said.  Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai welcomed the global focus on privacy, saying that the company was doing its part by taking measures to allow users more control over their data.  \u201cUser trust is the foundation for everything we do, and privacy and security are fundamental tenets of that,\u201d he said by video message. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working for years to provide more transparency and control for our users, and we appreciate the input and partnership from data protection authorities.\u201d  Cook also warned about governments abusing users\u2019 data and their trust, a concern for many with elections coming up in several countries.  \u201cRogue actors and even governments have taken advantage of user trust to deepen divisions, incite violence, and even undermine our shared sense of what is true and what is false.\u201d  Cook said Apple fully backed a federal privacy law in the United States, something Europe has already introduced via its General Data Protection Regulation.  \u201cUsers should always know what data is being collected and what it is being collected for,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the only way to empower users to decide what collection is legitimate and what isn\u2019t.

The company, which recently became a plastic-OLED display vendor for Apple Inc\u2019s latest iPhones, has said it expects to kick off mass production at its China OLED factory some time in the March quarter.  LG Display has not yet closed any of its Chinese factories since the outbreak of a new coronavirus which has killed over 200 people in the country and infected thousands, the company said, adding the matter increased uncertainty on the LCD supply side.  The company posted a loss of 422 billion won ($361.6 million) in the October-December quarter, compared with an operating profit of 279 billion won a year earlier.  Analysts expected a 578 billion won loss, according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate.  LCD panel prices have been falling for two-and-a-half years in a market crowded with Chinese makers. The glut has forced LG Display and rival Samsung Display - a unit of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd - to cut output, a move analysts said could take some pressure off prices this year.  Prices have risen slightly since late December, but on Thursday, Samsung Electronics said it nevertheless expected the business to remain weak in 2020.  \u201cSouth Korean display makers including LG Display could benefit from a recent uptick in LCD prices, but LG Display will likely speed up its transition to OLED business as the global LCD market has long been suffering from a supply glut,\u201d said analyst Kim Chul-joong at Mirae Asset Daewoo Research.

The factory was shut after contract workers angry over unpaid wages destroyed property, equipment and iPhones on Dec. 12, causing millions of dollars worth of damage.  An Apple audit found violations of its \u2018Supplier Code of Conduct\u2019 at the plant.  Separately, Wistron said it was working hard to raise standards and fix issues at the factory. It said it had paid all workers and introduced new hiring and payroll systems.  \u201cWe are looking forward to restarting our operations and welcoming back team members,\u201d Wistron said, without giving a timeline.  Neither Apple nor Wistron said when iPhone production would resume at the plant, but three government officials, who declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media, told Reuters operations could begin as early as next week.  Wistron would gradually ramp up production at the factory over the next few weeks, two of the sources said.  Apple began the assembly of its first iPhone model in India via Wistron in 2017.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Epic Games filed for a preliminary injunction that would put its game back in the App Store and restore its developer account. The filing was made in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.  It argued that Epic Games is \u201clikely to suffer irreparable harm\u201d in the absence of a preliminary injunction and that \u201cthe balance of harms tips sharply in Epic\u2019s favor\u201d.  The filing described the iPhone maker as a \u201cmonopolist\u201d that maintains its monopolies by \u201cexplicitly prohibiting any competitive entry\u201d.  Late last week, Apple terminated Epic Games\u2019 account on its App Store amid a legal battle over the iPhone maker\u2019s in-app payment guidelines and accusations they constitute a monopoly.  Apple said last week its move will not affect Epic Games\u2019 Unreal Engine, a software tool relied on by hundreds of other app makers.  But the move meant iPhone users will not be able to download \u201cFortnite\u201d or other Epic titles through the Apple App Store.  \u201cThis was a clear warning to any other developer that would dare challenge Apple\u2019s monopolies: follow our rules or we will cut you off from a billion iOS consumers - challenge us and we will destroy your business,\u201d Epic Games said in Friday\u2019s filing.  Apple pulled Epic Games after the popular games creator implemented a feature to let iPhone users make in-app purchases directly, rather than using Apple\u2019s in-app purchase system, which charges commissions of 30%.  Apple had said it would allow \u201cFortnite\u201d back into the store if Epic removed the direct payment feature. But Epic refused to do so, saying complying with Apple\u2019s request would be \u201cto collude with Apple to maintain their monopoly over in-app payments on iOS.\u201d","1553":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Apple is seen at a store in Zurich, Switzerland January 3, 2019.

The program, or accelerator, will hold lectures, workshops and networking sessions for developers regularly, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. More than 2.5 million developers for Apple\u2019s platforms are from greater China, a region that includes Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China.  The launch comes at a time when iPhone sales in China - and the world - have slowed and CEO Tim Cook has talked up Apple\u2019s services business in the country as a bright spot. The services business gets revenue from apps, media, and other software.  On Tuesday, a report from research firm Evercore ISI said that Apple\u2019s services revenue had likely risen over the quarter ended June, driven in part by growth in China.  Apple opened a similar accelerator in 2017 in Bengaluru, India. Both the Indian and Chinese smartphone markets are dominated by companies who make Android-based devices, such as Xiaomi 1810.HK and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS.  To tackle competition, Apple launched several financing schemes earlier this year to make iPhones more affordable for Chinese consumers. Chinese electronics retailers also reduced the price of some iPhone models.  To add to slowing sales, Apple has also been caught up in a trade war between Washington and Beijing.  According to Japan's Nikkei, Apple has asked suppliers to assess the cost implications of moving some production capacity out of China. Foxconn 2317.TW, a major contractor for Apple, has said it is prepared to move Apple manufacturing out of China if needed.  In June, Tim Cook told CBS news he does not anticipate China targeting Apple amid the trade tensions.","1554":"FILE PHOTO: An Apple logo hangs above the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in the Manhattan borough of New York City, July 21, 2015.

Apple\u2019s service had 28 million subscribers as of the end of February compared with Spotify\u2019s 26 million paid subscribers, the person said.  Both companies charge $9.99 a month for subscriptions, though Spotify still has more total U.S. listeners than an Apple thanks to an ad-supported free tier of its service with fewer features. Analysts also believe Spotify has a stronger subscriber position than Apple outside the United States.  Neither Apple nor Spotify disclose country-level listener data, and both firms declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Apple has overtaken Spotify on the metric.  Apple\u2019s streaming service is part of a broader push at the company to make money off subscriptions and services as iPhone sales slow. Last month the company announced a news, television and gaming subscriptions, as well as a credit card partnership with Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Spotify likely still has more paying users than Apple Music, with 96 million premium subscribers and 207 million month active users as of its most recent earnings report in February. The company said in its report that it has 28.8 million premium subscribers and 62.1 million monthly active listeners in its North American region, which includes Canada but not Mexico.  Apple does not regularly disclose how many subscribers it has, and the last official count - 50 million - came almost a year ago in May of 2018.  About 67 million of Spotify\u2019s premium subscribers are outside of North America, the company said in its most recent quarterly report.","1555":"Oct 8 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Thursday said it would adopt a set of 10 principles for running its app store for Windows devices that could lower the commissions it charges, aligning itself with practices promoted by a group of Apple Inc critics.  Microsoft and scores of other companies have criticized the iPhone maker\u2019s app store practices, which require developers to use Apple\u2019s official store to reach its hundreds of millions of users and to pay commissions of up to 30% for purchases made in Apple\u2019s store.  Last month, a number of those critics including Spotify Technology SA and Match Group Inc formed a group called the Coalition for App Fairness to challenge Apple\u2019s practices. The group laid out 10 principles - including barring \u201cunfair, unreasonable or discriminatory fees or revenue shares\u201d - that it urged all app stores to follow.  Microsoft runs an app store for PCs, laptops and tablets that use Windows 10 called the Microsoft Store. In a blog post Thursday, Microsoft said it would adopt 10 principles that closely mirrored the group\u2019s demands but did not formally join the group.  Some of the principles will have no immediate effect other than codifying existing Microsoft practices. For example, Microsoft already allows third-party app stores and downloads from the internet on Windows devices.  But other principles - such as a commitment to \u201ccharge reasonable fees that reflect the competition we face from other app stores on Windows\u201d - could mean changes to Microsoft\u2019s commissions of between 15% and 30% of store purchases. Microsoft said it might revise the principles in the future.  In a statement, Spotify said that Microsoft\u2019s new position \u201cwill help create a level playing field for developers both large and small, provide consumers with greater choice, and hopefully encourage other platforms to do the same.\u201d (Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; editing by Richard Pullin)","1556":"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O faces more regulatory woes in Europe as EU antitrust regulators ask online sales companies whether they have been told to use its mobile payment service instead of rival services, an EU document seen by Reuters showed.

Launched in October 2014, Apple\u2019s mobile payment service Apple Pay is part of the company\u2019s diversification from device sales. It is available in more than 50 countries worldwide, including in more than 20 EU countries.  The questionnaire asked if companies were under a contractual obligation to enable a certain payment method and also if such contracts included conditions for integrating Apple Pay in their apps and websites.  Regulators wanted to know if Apple has rejected merchant apps as incompatible with the terms and conditions for integrating Apple Pay in their apps.  The Commission confirmed that it had sought information from market participants.  \u201cThe Commission is actively monitoring the development of mobile payment solutions, the behaviour by operators active in the payments sector, including mobile payments,\u201d the EU competition enforcer said.  Apple said its payment system offers the safest and most secure solution in the market as evidenced by the thousands of banks using it.  \u201cIPhone has completely transformed mobile payments by providing customers with a choice of how to pay including cash, credit card and debit card, as well using apps from the major banks and financial institutions,\u201d it said.  Critics have long complained about an NFC chip embedded in the Apple iPhone which means Apple Pay is automatically selected when an iPhone user pays for goods and services, barring rival payment methods.  Recent alerts on iPhones asking users if they want to set up Apple Pay on their devices have also triggered protests from some.  In an interview with Reuters last year, European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said she might investigate Apple Pay if there are formal complaints.

REUTERS\/Loren Elliott  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple\u2019s replacement for its iPhone cash cow is arguably its services business. The $2.4 trillion technology firm hauled in nearly $16 billion in revenue last quarter from charging customers for cloud storage and taking cuts from payments in its App Store.  The iPhone, the creation of former boss Steve Jobs, paved the way to a groundbreaking market value of $1 trillion, now in the rear-view mirror. The company led by Tim Cook on Wednesday reported a record $111 billion in total sales for the quarter ending Dec. 26, up 21% year-on-year. The growth spurt was partly due to a 24% rise in services revenue. The holidays, new 5G handsets and a spark in sales in China boosted demand for the iPhone as well.  It\u2019s not a slick, revolutionary new gadget, but hooking people up with recurring subscriptions and such is a good way to keep the money machine humming. Say services revenue increases 11% annually from Apple\u2019s last full year, a slowdown from the current pace as suggested by research firm Trefis. Give the mobile phone unit the benefit of 5% growth, weaker than last quarter but stronger than recent full years. Assume a gross margin of some 66% for services versus just over 30% for handsets. On those estimates, services could be making more gross profit for Apple than iPhones by 2024.  Unfortunately, though, lawmakers are circling Apple\u2019s dominance over its App Store. There\u2019s also pressure from third parties like Spotify Technology and \u201cFortnite\u201d producer Epic Games over the tech giant\u2019s cut of payments. And the revenue it gets from Alphabet\u2019s Google unit to make it the default search engine on the iPhone is an antitrust target, too.

FILE PHOTO: Berkshire Hathaway shareholders attends a cocktail reception hosted by Berkshire-owned Borsheim's jewelry store on the weekend of the company's annual meeting in Omaha May 3, 2013. REUTERS\/Rick Wilking  Some Berkshire operating businesses have rebounded from their spring depths, and analysts were encouraged that revenue fell just 3% from a year earlier.  But COVID-19, hurricanes and low interest rates hurt profit from insurance businesses, which include the Geico auto insurer, and the Precision Castparts aircraft parts unit projected thousands of additional job losses.  Berkshire also repurchased a record $9.3 billion of its underperforming stock in the third quarter, as Buffett remained unable to find the huge acquisitions the 90-year-old billionaire wants to spur growth.  Buybacks totaled $16 billion from January to September, and appeared to total at least $2.3 billion in October because Berkshire\u2019s share count dropped.  \u201cThe market will be encouraged by the buybacks,\u201d said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research with a \u201chold\u201d rating on Berkshire. \u201cMany companies halted buybacks to preserve resources during the pandemic, though because Berkshire doesn\u2019t pay a dividend the amount it is returning to shareholders pales bit.\u201d  Third-quarter operating profit fell 32% to $5.48 billion, or about $3,488 per Class A share, from $8.07 billion a year earlier.  Net income rose 82% to $30.1 billion, or $18,994 per Class A share, from $16.5 billion, or $10,119 per share. Revenue totaled $63 billion.  NEW USES FOR CASH  Berkshire reported $24.8 billion of gains from investments such as Apple, whose stock rose 27% in the quarter and at $111.7 billion is by far Berkshire\u2019s biggest stock holding, comprising 46% of its portfolio.  Nevertheless, it appears Berkshire may have sold some Apple stock because the stake should have been a few billion dollars higher, based on previously disclosed stakes, if none was sold.  Net results are volatile because an accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized gains and losses on its stocks. The company posted a $26.3 billion second-quarter profit, but lost nearly $50 billion in the first quarter.  Despite the buybacks, Berkshire ended the quarter with $145.7 billion of cash and equivalents.  The Omaha, Nebraska-based company has also found new ways to spend cash, investing $6 billion in five Japanese trading houses and backing the initial public offering of data storage company Snowflake Inc.  \u201cIt\u2019s a good quarter, and I\u2019m pleased by the level of cash deployment,\u201d said Jim Shanahan, an Edward Jones analyst with a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on Berkshire. \u201cIf we have a second wave of the pandemic, Buffett is still positioned to take advantage.\u201d  JOB LOSSES  Precision, which Berkshire bought in 2016 for $32.1 billion in its largest-ever acquisition, has been hit hard by the downturn in the aerospace industry, including in the second quarter when Berkshire took a $9.8 billion writedown.  Third-quarter pretax profit fell 80%, and Berkshire expects the unit will by year end have shed 40% of its workforce from the end of 2019.  That equates to roughly 13,400 jobs, or 3,400 more than Berkshire previously disclosed had been lost.  While Berkshire took no major third-quarter writedowns, it said the pandemic could force additional writedowns.  Insurance profit fell 58% to $802 million, reflecting lower premiums at Geico, COVID-19, Hurricanes Laura and Sally, and lower income from investments as interest rates tumble.  Geico awarded drivers $2.5 billion of credits on policy renewals this year, and Berkshire said its accounting for those credits should hurt underwriting results through March 2021.  Profit fell just 8% at the BNSF railroad, as cost-cutting helped offset lower shipping volumes. \u201cThat positions it well for when revenue and volumes recover,\u201d Shanahan said.  Results improved in Berkshire\u2019s energy businesses, and profit at its real-estate brokerage more than doubled as low interest rates drove more people to buy homes.","1560":"FILE PHOTO: 3D printed coronavirus model and Google logo are placed near an Apple Macbook Pro in this illustration taken April 12, 2020.

Vestager said so far she has not received any complaint about Apple\u2019s changes.  She said the privacy move is also similar to her proposal unveiled last year to curb the powers of U.S. tech giants and allow consumers to have more control of their personal data.  \u201cIt is a very good thing to have a clear opt-out option. If you look at the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act, these are some of the solutions we are looking at there.\u201d  Apple was not immediately available for comment.

Analysts believe games are the biggest contributor to spending inside the App Store, which is in turn the largest component of Apple\u2019s $46.3 billion-per-year services segment.

The title\u2019s removal from the App Store means that new players will not be able to download it and that existing players cannot receive updates, but the game should continue to work on devices where it is already installed.  Epic Games does not disclose how many iOS users \u201cFortnite\u201d has. Many fans play the game primarily on PCs or gaming consoles while using their mobile phones as a backup, but iPhone users generate far more revenue for Epic.  In both Apple\u2019s App Store and Google\u2019s Play Store, \u201cFortnite\u201d had about 2 million downloads in July 2020, according to mobile analytics firm SensorTower. But Apple users spent about $34 million while Android users spent only $2 million, according to SensorTower data.  Because Android functions differently from iOS, users can still download \u201cFortnite\u201d from Epic\u2019s website and other non-Google stores such as the one run by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and install it on their devices, Epic said in a blog post on Thursday.  \u201cEpic is not seeking any monetary relief, but rather only an order enjoining Google from continuing to impose its anti-competitive conduct on the Android ecosystem,\u201d it said in its lawsuit.  In a statement, Spotify Technology SA, a streaming music rival to Apple that has filed an antitrust complaint against the iPhone maker in Europe, applauded Epic\u2019s move.  \u201cApple\u2019s unfair practices have disadvantaged competitors and deprived consumers for far too long,\u201d Spotify said.","1566":"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Apple Inc and Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] each captured a higher share of China\u2019s smartphone market in the first quarter, according to data from research firm Canalys released on Friday.

REUTERS\/Aly Song  Total smartphone shipments in the country in the three months ended March fell 18% from a year earlier to 72.6 million, the data showed, as the coronavirus outbreak took a toll on Chinese supply chains and consumer demand.  China\u2019s Huawei, the No.2 smartphone seller in the world by volume, grabbed 41.4% of the domestic market, up from 33.9% a year earlier. Its overall unit shipments rose about 1% to 30.1 million.  That growth came at the expense of Android rivals Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi Corp. The three companies saw shipments plunge by 26%, 19%, and 26%, respectively.  All four companies rely significantly on overseas sales for revenue, although Huawei will depend on the domestic market increasingly as its latest devices do not run the complete suite of Google Mobile Services due to restrictions placed on it by the U.S. government.  Apple shipments sank more than 4%, marking a significant dip but below the industry average. However, its share of the market grew, hitting 8.5% from 7.3% last year.  Apple reported sales and profits that beat Wall Street expectations on Thursday, with Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook saying China sales were \u201cheaded in the right direction\u201d as the country reopens from restrictions imposed to curb the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.  Apple is expected to release its first 5G phone later this year. Online retailers in China recently slashed prices of the iPhone 11, and analysts said the company\u2019s new, mid-range iPhone SE was selling better than expected in the country.  After enduring years of market contraction, Chinese Android smartphone players were hoping that releasing new 5G models would prompt consumers to purchase new devices.  But analysts now expect consumers will delay purchasing 5G phones, opting instead for cheaper, still serviceable 4G devices as a coronavirus-induced recession looms.  \u201cLooking ahead, we remain cautious about the speed of recovery in China\u2019s smartphone market this year, and maintain our best-case scenario of 326 million shipments for 2020, including 137 million 5G smartphones,\u201d said Nicole Peng, vice president of mobility at Canalys.  \u201cThe macroeconomic situation is a huge red flag for China\u2019s market players this year.\u201d  Market research firm TrendForce said on Thursday it expects 2020 smartphone output globally to slump 11.3% to 1.24 billion.","1567":"(Reuters) - Shares of audio device makers Sonos Inc and Logitech fell on Tuesday after their speakers were removed from Apple Inc\u2019s online stores.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Japan Display said it was considering all options for its plant in Hakusan City, Ishikawa prefecture in western Japan, but that nothing has been decided.  The maker of advanced LCD screens owes Apple more than $800 million for the $1.5 billion cost of building the plant four years ago.  A sale of the entire factory would represent a shift from Japan Display\u2019s statement this month that $200 million promised by a customer, which sources said was Apple, may come in the form of purchasing equipment at the plant.  The Nikkei put the potential sale price at 80 billion yen to 90 billion yen ($730 million to $820 million).  A separate report in the Asahi newspaper said Sharp aims to purchase the plant, which has been idle since July, by March of next year and that details would be worked out with Apple.  Japan Display\u2019s shares rose as much as 8.2% in Tokyo trade on the reports, valuing the company at around 67 billion yen.  It said this month that it plans to receive up to 90 billion yen in financial support from Ichigo Asset Management, giving the Japanese asset manager effective control.  Taiwanese contract electronics manufacturer Wistron Corp 3231.TW is also set to take part in the bailout.  Japan Display has lost money for the past five years and reported its 11th consecutive quarterly net loss last month on sluggish display sales and restructuring costs.  Although a late shift to OLED screens has cost it orders from Apple and is responsible for much of Japan Display\u2019s financial woes, the U.S. tech giant still accounted for about 60% of its revenues in the last financial year ended March.","1569":"Aug 31 (Reuters) - The high-flying shares of Apple Inc and Tesla Inc gained more ground on Monday, ahead of their first official trading following a split into smaller portions that makes it easier for retail investors to own the shares.  It will be Apple\u2019s latest stock split since a 7-for-1 move in 2014 and its fifth since going public in 1980.  Splitting stocks is a way for companies to make it less expensive to buy individual shares although moves by some retail brokerages to offer slices or fractions of shares to smaller investors has made the impact increasingly marginal.  Shares of the Cupertino-California-based company, which have rallied nearly 30% since it announced its surprise 4-for-1 stock split and blockbuster quarterly results on July 30, were priced at $126.56, up 1.4% when compared to Friday\u2019s split-adjusted close, in pre-market trade.  The rally helped the iPhone maker overtake Saudi Aramco as the world\u2019s most valuable publicly listed company and become the first publicly listed U.S. company to breach $2 trillion in market capitalization.  Apple shares closed at $499.23 before the split on Friday, up 70% this year.  TESLA IN HOT PURSUIT  The electric carmaker followed suit earlier this month by announcing a 5-for-1 split to portion its richly valued stock into smaller chunks, which also takes effect on Monday.  Tesla\u2019s stock has surged more than five-fold this year, while shares of General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co declined on fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Shares of Tesla, up 61% since it announced what is its first stock split in mid-August, closed at $2,213.4 on Friday. They were priced up 2.33% at $453 when counted at their post-split value in pre-market on Monday.  Online brokerages Robinhood, Charles Schwab Corp and Fidelity, along with several smaller shops, have begun offering slices of individual shares.  Stock splits have become rare on Wall Street in recent years, with just three S&P 500 members announcing splits in 2020, compared to an average of ten a year over the past decade, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.","1570":"Sept 19 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended mixed on Thursday, with a dip in Apple Inc shares offsetting a gain in Microsoft Corp shares a day after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates as expected and left the door open for further monetary easing.

Apple initially launched the program last year, but it only covered iPhones, the company\u2019s biggest-selling product. Mac users previously either had to use Apple or an authorized warranty service provider to get fixes with parts directly from Apple.  Apple last month reported an uptick of 21.6% in quarterly Mac sales to $7 billion as many employees shifted to working from home. Its market share grew to 7.3% in the second quarter from 6.3% a year earlier, according to research firm IDC.  Apple\u2019s shift in repair practices came after years of calls from right-to-repair groups who had criticized the company for, among other things, only providing genuine parts and training manuals to firms such as Best Buy Inc that were to do warranty-related work on its devices. Smaller shops argued that program was too costly to join due to volume commitments.  With the independent repair program, Apple began offering to sell parts and provide free training courses to independent shops to perform out-of-warranty work.  After starting in the United States, Apple expanded the program to 32 countries in Europe as well as Canada last month, saying 140 businesses with a total of 700 locations had signed up.

Qualcomm on Dec. 10 said it had won a preliminary court order in China banning Apple from selling some older iPhone models that the court found violated two Qualcomm software patents. The same day, Apple said that all of its phones remained on sale in China.  But on Dec. 14, Apple said that it would push a software update to its iPhones this week.

Apple never publicly commented last week on why or how it believed its current iPhones for sale in China complied with the court\u2019s order, which concerned patents on software features for switching between apps on a smart phone and resizing photos before setting them as a wallpaper on a phone.  Several media outlets, including CNBC, reported that Apple believed the court\u2019s orders applied only to iPhones running older versions of its iOS operating system. But the court\u2019s orders, a copy of which Qualcomm provided to Reuters, made no mention of operating systems and focused only on software features.  \u201cApple\u2019s statements following the issuance of the preliminary injunction have been deliberate attempts to obfuscate and misdirect,\u201d Qualcomm\u2019s Rosenberg said in a statement on Monday.  Qualcomm believes Apple is still in violation of the court\u2019s orders because Apple continues to sell phones and has not received an explicit order from the Chinese court allowing it to do so.  \u201cThey are legally obligated to immediately cease sales, offers for sale and importation of the devices identified in the orders and to prove compliance in court,\u201d Rosenberg told Reuters in Dec. 14 in a statement.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Japan Display is facing a funding crunch due to Apple\u2019s recent shift away from liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) and disappointing sales of the iPhone XR, the only LCD model in Apple\u2019s 2018 line-up.  Apple, which accounted for 60.6% of Japan Display\u2019s revenue in the last financial year ended March, will join a consortium led by China\u2019s Harvest Group in investing up to 80 billion yen ($743 million), said a person briefed on the matter.  Apple declined to comment.  Japan Display said in a statement Harvest had formalized its decision to inject nearly $500 million, including the $100 million investment from the unidentified customer.  In a separate statement later on Friday, the Japanese company said another consortium member, Hong Kong-based activist investor Oasis Management, has decided to invest $150 million to $180 million. The investment is dependent on conditions including no major cuts in orders from a main customer.  The total investment from Harvest, Apple and Oasis will be still short of Japan Display\u2019s $743 million target. The company said it is in talks with other potential investors to join the deal.  The Asahi newspaper first reported on Apple\u2019s planned investment on Thursday, sending Japan Display shares up as much as 32%. On Friday, the stock was flat.  Japan Display had been pursuing a bailout deal with a Chinese-Taiwanese consortium, but the suitors repeatedly delayed making a formal decision in order to reassess the company\u2019s prospects.  Taiwanese screen maker TPK Holding Co Ltd 3673.TW and financial firm CGL Group dropped out of the process earlier this month.

To help stabilize Japan Display\u2019s finances, Apple has agreed to slow the pace of repayment for two years and to consider increasing orders from Japan Display.  The U.S. tech giant will also procure some organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens from Japan Display for the Apple Watch later this year.

The thousands of developers expected to descend on San Jose this week write the apps in Apple\u2019s App Store. The App Store is a key driver of the iPhone maker\u2019s services segment, which brought in $37.1 billion in revenue last year. Apple takes a cut of sales from apps sold through the store, though that practice is under scrutiny in several legal proceedings.  Investors are looking to Apple\u2019s services business to power Apple\u2019s revenue and profits as iPhone sales decline. Revenue from the company\u2019s signature device had its biggest-year-over year decline ever in its most recent quarterly earnings report.  But Apple still sold more than 10 times as many iPhones and iPads as it did Mac computers last year, so many developers focus on writing their apps for them rather than the Mac.  Chief Executive Tim Cook and software chief Craig Federighi are expected to announce in a keynote address new tools that will make it easier for developers to put their apps on Macs without completely rewriting the code. Apple previewed the tools at last year\u2019s conference, saying they would be released this year, and Bloomberg reported in recent weeks that Apple still plans to release them.  The move could broaden the apps available for Macs and give Apple more chances to make money on apps for its longest-lived product line. Apple will also update its operating systems and apps at the annual conference.  The updates come as Apple\u2019s App Store practices are under scrutiny. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed an antitrust lawsuit to proceed from users who allege Apple inflated the price of apps by not allowing iPhones to download apps outside the App Store.

REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann\/File Photo  DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's debt agency has invested disputed taxes collected from Apple AAPL.O in low risk, highly rated euro-dominated fixed income securities, mainly short to medium-term sovereign and quasi-sovereign bonds, it said in an annual report.  The European Commission ruled in August 2016 that Apple had received unfair tax incentives from Dublin in breach of EU state aid rules and ordered Ireland to recover more than 14 billion euros, including interest, from the iPhone maker.  While Apple and Dublin are appealing against the ruling, saying the tax treatment was in line with Irish and EU law, Apple nevertheless had to hand over the full amount, pending the result of the appeal - which will likely take several years.  Ireland is holding the funds in an escrow account whose aim, the National Treasury Management Agency\u2019s (NTMA) annual report said, was to preserve capital to the greatest extent possible given prevailing market conditions.  The government said Irish taxpayers would be protected from any losses when setting up the fund. NTMA chief executive Conor O\u2019Kelly said on Monday that the value of the fund was very likely to fall unless the interest rate environment changes.  \u201cFor example, at minus 50 basis points interest rate on average, which is close to the current portfolio\u2019s construction average, that would be a 5 million loss per billion, so that\u2019s a 70 million loss in value per annum,\u201d O\u2019Kelly said at the launch of the annual report.  \u201cBut there is no loss to the state. Apple and Ireland have agreed that the pot is the pot, whatever is there at the end so we don\u2019t have to make up any difference. That\u2019s an agreed investment policy.\u201d","1585":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O said on Thursday it would spend $1 billion to build a second campus in Austin, Texas, that will house up to 15,000 workers as part of a broader push by U.S. companies to create more domestic jobs.  The iPhone maker also said it plans to expand in Seattle, San Diego and Culver City, California, and add hundreds of jobs in Pittsburgh, New York and Boulder, Colorado, over the next three years.  Apple said at the start of the year it would invest $30 billion in the United States, taking advantage of a windfall from U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tax code overhaul.  The 133-acre campus in Austin will be less than a mile from Apple\u2019s existing facilities and initially have 5,000 employees. The jobs created would be in engineering, research and development, operations and finance.  Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O in November said it will create more than 25,000 jobs in both New York and the Washington, D.C. area by opening massive new offices. The two technology companies chose cities with a wealth of white-collar workers and high employment, bypassing other regions that may have required more investment.  Austin is one of the fastest-growing U.S. cities with a population of nearly 1 million, and is home to the University of Texas and other tech companies including Dell Technologies Inc in nearby Round Rock, Texas, and IBM.  Apple\u2019s existing facility in north Austin has more than 6,000 workers, the most outside its headquarters in Cupertino, California. With the new campus, the company will become the largest private employer in the city.  \u201cApple has been a vital part of the Austin community for a quarter century, and we are thrilled that they are deepening their investment,\u201d Austin Mayor Steve Adler said on Thursday.  Corporate America has been under political pressure to ramp up investments at home as part of Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies, which have led to a bitter trade war with China. Trump has also warned of possible tariffs on iPhones and other Apple products imported from China.  The Apple logo is shown during an Apple launch event in the Brooklyn borough of New York, U.S., October 30, 2018. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  It is in the interest of U.S. companies to tout job creation because those that move positions overseas or shutter factories have drawn sharp rebukes from Trump, who has championed job creation. Most recently, the president said he told General Motors Co Chief Executive Mary Barra he was unhappy with her decision to cut production at an Ohio factory.  APPLE PICKS TEXAS  The new Austin campus marks a turnabout from Chief Executive Tim Cook\u2019s earlier comments that Texas would be an unlikely choice for a new campus.  \u201cApple is proud to bring new investment, jobs and opportunity to cities across the United States and to significantly deepen our quarter-century partnership with the city and people of Austin,\u201d Cook said.  Apple could be getting some incentives for the Austin expansion in the form of a $25 million grant from the Texas Enterprise Fund, a source familiar with the matter said.  The fund awards \u201cdeal closing grants\u201d to companies looking at new projects in Texas, according to its web site. The Austin American-Statesman newspaper reported that Apple is also seeking a 15-year property tax abatement for the new campus and said the city did not provide incentives.  Unlike tech rival Amazon, Apple did not hold a public bidding process to choose the site of its new campus.  Amazon last month ended a more than year-long bidding war for a $5 billion second headquarters, splitting that investment between Long Island City in Queens, New York, and Arlington, Virginia, for offices that could each house 25,000 jobs.  Amazon\u2019s plans for its New York City headquarters met with backlash from some city officials and state representatives due to the project\u2019s large tax breaks and potential impact on the neighborhood\u2019s infrastructure.  Last year, Apple moved into its sleek \u201cspaceship\u201d campus in Cupertino that cost about $5 billion.  The company has added 6,000 U.S. jobs this year and is on track to reach the goal it set out in January of adding 20,000 domestic jobs by 2023.  Shares of Apple rose 1.3 percent to $171.43 in midday trading. They have tumbled more than 20 percent since Nov. 1, when Apple warned sales for the crucial holiday quarter would likely miss Wall Street expectations.","1586":"FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc. logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, New York, U.S., October 16, 2019.

The prospect of higher borrowing rates was one of the factors, along with tariffs and slowing global growth, that triggered a tumble in the stock markets last month.

The Nasdaq Composite was down 83.89 points, or 1.13 percent, at 7,350.16.  Apple aside, most earnings reports were strong.  Exxon Mobil Corp climbed 1.4 percent and Chevron Corp gained 3.8 percent after reporting strong profits.  Starbucks Corp jumped as much as 12 percent to a record high after the coffee chain reported strong sales in the United States and China.  \u201cYou have other areas of the market that are acting well, but not well not enough to counterbalance the effects of Apple today,\u201d SlateStone Wealth\u2019s Pavlik said.

FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc. logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, New York, U.S., October 16, 2019. REUTERS\/Mike Segar  Apple carried Tile on its app store and had sold its products at its stores since 2015. It had even showcased Tile\u2019s technology at a big event in 2018. The startup had sent an engineer to Apple\u2019s headquarters to develop a feature with the company\u2019s voice assistant, Siri.  Then, in early 2019, Tile\u2019s executives read news reports of Apple launching a hardware product, along with a service that resembled what Tile sold. In June, Apple stopped selling Tile\u2019s products in its stores and has since hired its engineer.  The smart-tracker startup was one of four companies that testified at the latest hearing of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee in Colorado on Friday. The smaller companies are seeking to urge Congress to look at how big tech use their considerable clout to hurt rivals.  Similar investigations are underway at the Justice Department, at the Federal Trade Commission, and with a bipartisan collection of attorneys general from dozens of states.  \u201cAfter thoughtful consideration and months of bringing our concerns to Apple through regular... channels, Tile has made the decision to continue raising concerns over Apple\u2019s anti-competitive practices,\u201d Tile\u2019s general counsel Kirsten Daru told Reuters in an interview ahead of the hearing.  An Apple spokesman said the company has not built a business model around knowing a customer\u2019s location or the location of their device.  In September, House lawmakers asked more than 80 companies for information about how their businesses may have been harmed by anti-competitive behavior from Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Alphabet\u2019s Google.

PopSockets, a seller of collapsible phone grips, testified against Amazon. The company\u2019s chief executive David Barnett said the firm started as a seller on Amazon\u2019s third-party marketplace and then sold items directly to Amazon as a vendor, but decided to end its relationship with the company after two years in 2018.  Barnett said Amazon required PopSockets to pay almost $2 million in marketing so it could market its products as originals in the face of a wave of counterfeits. The online retailer \u201cfrequently lowered their selling price of our product and then expected and needed us to help pay for the lost margin,\u201d he said.  \u201cOn multiple occasions we found that Amazon Retail was itself sourcing counterfeit PopGrips and selling them alongside our authentic products,\u201d he told lawmakers.  Amazon spokesman Jack Evans said PopSockets was free to choose which retailers it supplies and could choose to stop selling via Amazon.

Basecamp, which sells an online project management tool, complained about Google allowing competitors to bid to have their own ads run when its trademarked name was typed into the search engine.  It said the practice allowed competitors to purchase ads that made it hard for consumers to reach Basecamp\u2019s website, co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson told Reuters in an interview ahead of the hearing. The company has opened multiple trademark infringement investigations with Google but the process is \u201conerous and slow,\u201d he said.  \u201cGoogle\u2019s monopoly on internet search must be broken up for the sake of a fair marketplace,\u201d Hansson said. Basecamp is now forced to run a more than $70,000 annual advertising campaign to counteract the effect, he said.  Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said for trademarked terms like names of a business, the company\u2019s policy balances the interest of both users and advertisers.  Google allows competitors to bid on trademarked terms because that offers users more choice when they are searching, but if a trademark owner files a complaint, Google blocks competitors from using their actual name in the text of the advertisement, Castaneda said.","1593":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donna Fenn bought shares of Apple Inc AAPL.O in the 1980s on the recommendation of a stockbroker a good friend of hers was dating. She'd heard of the company because its co-founder Steve Jobs had appeared on the cover of the magazine she worked for.  At the end of 1985, not long after Fenn, now 59, made her investment, shares of Apple were trading at the equivalent of 39 cents each, adjusting for subsequent stock splits. Little could she imagine that the value of Apple shares bought then would climb more than 50,000 percent.  On Thursday, the market capitalization of Apple hit $1 trillion as its shares rose 2.8 percent to a high of $207.05. Apple, whose initial public offering was in December 1980, is the first U.S. company to reach that milestone.  Fenn and other Apple shareholders who first picked the stock in the 1980s and 1990s said they maintained a strong appreciation for the company, its products and its co-founder Jobs even as Apple teetered on the brink of bankruptcy in the late 1990s.  \u201cIt\u2019s now an iconic American brand,\u201d said Fenn, who lives in Pelham, New York.  FOR THE LOVE OF MAC  For much of the 1980s, Bruce Pfeffer used an Apple IIe to help run his company, which teaches children to perform circus arts such as juggling and fire-eating. He\u2019s owned Apple computers almost exclusively since then and travels in his RV, where he lives and works, with an array of iPads and iPod Touches.

As a teenager in Seattle, he enjoyed tinkering with computers and longed to buy a Mac for college. In 1997, his parents bought him Apple shares for his 15th birthday. Levin specifically requested the gift, in what he viewed as a small gesture to help keep the company alive.  \u201cIt almost felt like an act of solidarity,\u201d Levin, now 36 and living in Portland, Oregon, said.  HOLDING THROUGH TOUGH TIMES  At least one shareholder Reuters contacted anticipated that Steve Jobs\u2019 return to Apple in 1997 would mark a turning point for the company.  John Wallner, 61, a consultant in Portland, Oregon, had seen Jobs\u2019 business acumen firsthand. From 1983 to 1992, he worked at Apple, first as a product cost accountant for the original Macintosh and later as a factory manager.  While at Apple, Wallner routinely sold the shares he bought through the company\u2019s employee stock purchase plan, because he didn\u2019t want both his income and the bulk of his investments to come from a single company. But he kept the shares he acquired in his last few years at Apple. When Jobs returned to Apple, Wallner sensed rosier days ahead.  \u201cI had no motivation to get rid of (the stock),\u201d Wallner said. \u201cAt the time, I said, \u2018Well, let\u2019s just keep it lying around and watch what he does.\u2019\u201d  A SOLID INVESTMENT  Even since Jobs\u2019 death in 2011, long-time Apple shareholders said they have kept confidence in the company under Tim Cook, its current chief executive.  \u201cI see big upside, both for the products they\u2019re going to work on as well as the stock price,\u201d Wallner said.  Robert Emnett, 76, a retired management consultant in Manchester, Missouri, first bought Apple shares in 1996. He keeps nearly his entire investment portfolio in stocks and picks them according to criteria developed by BetterInvesting, a nonprofit that supports investment clubs. The average annual return for his Apple shares has exceeded that of most of his other holdings, Emnett said.  Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak pose with an Apple I board. Courtesy Stanford University Libraries\/Apple Computer Collection  Those strong returns have come in handy for several long-time shareholders. Emnett and his wife retired earlier than planned and have used their portfolio to supplement their employer-provided pensions. Pfeffer has sold some of his shares in order to fund his circus-arts education company, whose business is seasonal. Wallner used a portion of his stock to pay off loans he and his wife took out to finance their twin sons\u2019 college educations.  But even as Apple\u2019s market capitalization has breached the $1 trillion mark, they say they don\u2019t plan to sell off the entirety of their shares any time soon. Over the years, Emnett and Fenn have even given shares to their children.  \u201cI think I will always hold on to a little bit,\u201d Fenn said, \u201cso I can be that old lady who bought it when I was 25 years old.\u201d","1594":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc persuaded a federal appeals court on Friday to throw out a $234 million damages award in favor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison\u2019s patent licensing arm for infringing a patent on computer processing technology.

A German parliamentary committee unexpectedly voted in a late-night session on Wednesday to force the tech giant to open up Apple Pay to rival providers in Germany.  This came in the form of an amendment to an anti-money laundering law that was adopted late on Thursday by the full parliament and is set to come into effect early next year.

REUTERS\/Edgar Su  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - The surprise departure of Apple\u2019s retail chief, Angela Ahrendts, leaves two questions. Why did she leave? And had she done a good job? Investors can\u2019t know the answer to either. The $821 billion smartphone maker has a penchant for hiding information that investors would find useful. The lack of clarity helps explain the valuation discount hanging over its stock.  Ahrendts received $170 million in compensation in her five-year stint at Apple \u2013 a figure that includes unvested equity. The company added several dozen stores, and renovated more, between fiscal 2013 and today. These glistening temples of consumption buff Apple\u2019s image, and help customers get their iPhones fixed or figure out which Mac to buy. But the company stopped breaking out the sales and profitability of its stores years ago, so outsiders are left guessing on performance. They can\u2019t see whether Ahrendts\u2019 departure, announced on Tuesday, signifies problems or a mission satisfactorily completed.  In the past, Apple\u2019s silence has been a precursor to unpleasant news. The company said last year it would stop disclosing unit sales of iPhones, Macs and iPads \u2013 and issued a profit warning a few months later. The company said little about its watch sales when that product had a slow start. Sure, most rivals don\u2019t disclose unit sales either, and context is important. Apple\u2019s increasing reliance on services means declining numbers of gadgets sold might be nothing to fear, but the company can always explain if that\u2019s the case.  Apple could also disclose how much of its services revenue comes from Alphabet unit Google, which pays to be the default search engine for the company\u2019s gadgets. Goldman Sachs once pegged it at $9 billion annually, or more than one-tenth of the company\u2019s pre-tax profit. Perhaps best of all would be more information on what projects the company is working on, since a company\u2019s value resides mostly in the earnings that come years from now.  Investors aren\u2019t giving much credit to Apple anyway. The stock trades at just 14 times estimated earnings, according to Refinitiv data, a lowly rating for a tech company. Disclosing more might persuade the market the future is brighter than they thought. In any case it might earn Apple some credit for giving a fuller picture.","1599":"BERLIN, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Apple said on Friday moves in Germany to force it to open up its Apple Pay mobile payments system to rivals could hurt data protection and the security of financial information.

This came in the form of an amendment to an anti-money laundering law that was adopted late on Thursday by the full parliament and is set to come into effect early next year.  The legislation, which did not name Apple specifically, will force operators of electronic money infrastructure to offer access to rivals for a reasonable fee.  The law highlights growing desire in Germany for tighter regulation of U.S. technology companies.

Shares in the world\u2019s biggest publicly traded company have slid along with many others in the technology sector this year. Apple\u2019s 2.4 percent drop year-to-date in 2018 is its steepest since 2016, although in that year the company had already reported by the end of April.  The latest hit to the stock came in mid-April after a warning on global demand from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 2330.TW, the world's largest contract chipmaker, reminiscent of one from Cirrus Logic Inc CRUS.O five years ago.

FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc. logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, New York, U.S., October 16, 2019. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  Apple\u2019s lawsuit against a former chip executive-turned-rival will have implications for employees all over California who are considering striking out on their own and creating the startups that drive tech business and culture.  California\u2019s long-held public policy favors employee mobility in contrast to states that allow strong non-compete agreements. That stance allowed for the \u201ctraitorous eight\u201d who left their jobs at Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory for a rival in the late 1950s and who eventually spawned dozens of companies, including Intel Corp.  Apple filed the lawsuit in Santa Clara County Superior Court against Gerard Williams III, who left the company last year after more than nine years as chief architect for the custom processors that power iPhones and iPads to start Nuvia Inc, which is designing chips for servers.  Judge Mark H. Pierce last week issued a tentative ruling allowing the case to proceed but barring Apple from seeking punitive damages. Pierce will decide after a hearing on Tuesday whether to make his ruling final.  Apple sued Williams in August, alleging that he breached an intellectual property agreement and a duty of loyalty to the company by planning his new startup while on company time at Apple, spending hours on the phone with colleagues who eventually joined the venture.  Apple declined to comment on the case. Through a spokesman, Williams declined to comment. Apple is not suing Nuvia itself or any of Williams\u2019 co-founders and it did not allege any intellectual property or trade secret theft.  According to a copy of Williams\u2019 agreement that Apple attached to its complaint, the contract required that Williams \u201cwill not plan or engage in any other employment\u201d that competes with Apple or is directly related to the company.  In a filing in November, Williams argued that Apple\u2019s contract was unenforceable because California law allows employees to make some preparations to compete while still in their current job.  Even in California, there are limits, said Cliff Palefsky, a prominent San Francisco-based employment attorney. Workers can lay some plans for a competitor on their own time, but recruiting fellow employees on company time \u201cgets a little dicey.\u201d  In his tentative ruling, Pierce wrote that \u201can employee is not permitted to plan and prepare to create a competitive enterprise prior to termination if the employee does so on their employer\u2019s time and with the employer\u2019s resources.\u201d  The case will likely hinge the specific facts of Williams\u2019 planning for Nuvia, Palefsky said. Given that work at modern tech jobs rarely sticks to traditional business hours, it may be difficult to untangle whether calls were made during company time or personal time.  \u201cThat phrase - that you can\u2019t plan to compete - raises a very interesting question of whether (Apple\u2019s contract) is violative of the public policy and whether the courts are going to enforce it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is going to be some groundbreaking stuff, one way or the other.\u201d  The court has not set a trial date.","1604":"BERLIN, Nov 16 (Reuters) - A group led by privacy activist Max Schrems on Monday filed complaints with German and Spanish data protection authorities over Apple\u2019s online tracking tool, alleging that it allows iPhones to store users\u2019 data without their consent in breach of European law.  It is the first such major action against the U.S. technology group in regards to European Union privacy rules.  Apple says it provides users with a superior level of privacy protection. The company had announced it would further tighten its rules with the launch of its iOS 14 operating system this autumn but in September said it would delay the plan until early next year.  The complaints by digital rights group Noyb were brought against Apple\u2019s use of a tracking code that is automatically generated on every iPhone when it is set up, the so-called Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA).  The code, stored on the device, allows Apple and third parties to track a user\u2019s online behaviour and consumption preferences - vital for the likes of Facebook to be able to send targeted ads that will interest the user.  \u201cApple places codes that are comparable to a cookie in its phones without any consent by the user. This is a clear breach of European Union privacy laws,\u201d said Noyb lawyer Stefano Rossetti.  Rosetti referred to the EU\u2019s e-Privacy Directive, which requires a user\u2019s prior consent to the installation and use of such information.  Apple\u2019s planned new rules would not change this as they would restrict third-party access but not Apple\u2019s.  Apple accounts for one in every four smartphones sold in Europe, according to Counterpoint Research.  The claims were made on behalf of an individual German and Spanish consumers and handed to the Spanish data protection authority and its counterpart in Berlin, said Noyb, a privacy advocacy group led by Austrian Schrems that has successfully fought two landmark trials against Facebook.  In Germany, unlike Spain, each federal state has its own data protection authority.  Rossetti said the action was not about high fines but rather aimed at establishing a clear principle whereby \u201ctracking must be the exception, not the rule\u201d.  \u201cThe IDFA should not only be restricted, but permanently deleted,\u201d he said.

The agreement to license technology and take on people from the Anglo-German chip designer is not only unusual, but also the largest of its kind by Apple, whose last sizeable acquisition was the $350 million purchase of Face ID creator PrimeSense in 2013.  Dialog shares surged as much as 34 percent on Thursday, their most since 2002, as the deal bought the company time to reduce its dependence on Apple - which it expects to account for three-quarters of this year\u2019s sales.  Dialog\u2019s shares had tumbled earlier this year when it said Apple planned to use chips from another supplier.  Dialog Chief Executive Jalal Bagherli told Reuters he could now lead a \u201cmanaged, smooth\u201d transformation of the business as Dialog seeks new opportunities in areas such as the Internet of Things that includes connected devices like home speakers, fitness trackers or smart watches.  LONG-STANDING RELATIONSHIP  Since the first iPhones a decade ago, Apple has used Dialog power-management chips to extend their battery life. Under the deal, Apple is buying patents, taking on a 300-strong engineering team, most of whom already worked on chips for Apple devices, and Dialog offices in Britain, Italy and Germany.  Dialog said its 2018 revenue would not be affected and it would continue shipments of existing main power management integrated circuits (PMICs) to Apple. It expects to sell current and future generations of so-called sub-PMICs to Apple.  Bagherli said that Apple increasingly viewed main PMICs, which are central to the operation of its devices, as a strategic element that it wanted to control directly. This was not the case for sub-PMICs that manage features such as on-board cameras, he told Reuters.  A customer stands underneath an illuminated Apple logo as he looks out the window of the Apple store located in central Sydney, Australia, May 28, 2018. REUTERS\/David Gray  After the deal, Dialog expects Apple to account for 35-40 percent of its total revenues in 2022. That is down from around 75 percent in the current year. Headcount will fall to 1,800.  The chipmaker also said it would begin a share buyback program for up to 10 percent of its stock following its next quarterly trading update. The $600 million windfall will add to Dialog\u2019s already-healthy net cash position of $525 million, analysts said.  Other chip designers in Europe have struggled to manage their relationship with Apple due to its sheer scale. Britain\u2019s Imagination Technologies ended up being sold to a Chinese-backed fund last year after losing Apple as a client.  \u201cDialog has bought itself much more than just time,\u201d said Karsten Iltgen, an analyst at Bankhaus Lampe, which rates the stock \u2018buy\u2019. \u201cIts Apple business has been clearly defined and put on a sound long-term footing.\u201d  EUROPE PUSH  Half of the deal\u2019s value, or about $300 million, is cash for the Dialog engineers and offices and the other $300 million is pre-payment to Dialog for supplying chips over the next three years, the companies said.  Dialog said it would continue to deliver chips to other customers, focusing on the automotive and internet-of-things markets, among others.  It forecast that its sub-PMIC business would achieve compound annual growth rates of 30-35 percent between 2018 and 2022. Its AMS, Connectivity and Automotive & Industrial business would grow at a 10-15 percent rate.  The deal represents an expansion of Apple\u2019s chip design operations, which kicked into high gear in 2010 when the company released its first custom processor for the iPad and iPhone.  Apple is buying about 16 percent of Dialog\u2019s workforce. Apple said these employees would stay in Europe and would report to Johny Srouji, the company\u2019s senior vice president of hardware technologies who oversees Apple\u2019s chip design efforts.  \u201cOur relationship with Dialog goes all the way back to the early iPhones, and we look forward to continuing this long-standing relationship with them,\u201d Srouji said. Apple has added around 20,000 employees in Europe since 2000. It already has a chip design centers in Munich, Germany, where it employs 1,000 staff, and St Albans, Britain. The deal will give Apple four more from Dialog, in Livorno in Italy, Swindon in Britain, and Nabern and Neuaubing in Germany.  The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019, subject to customary closings and regulator approvals, Dialog said. It expects annual operational savings of $35 million from the deal, but declined to give more detail on its financial impact ahead of an investor presentation on Nov. 1.

In its filing, Epic Chief Executive Timothy Sweeney said \u201cFortnite\u201d had 350 million registered users as of June 2020, but that Apple\u2019s move will stop them from getting the updates needed to play the game\u2019s most popular mode - a \u201cBattle Royale\u201d match of up 100 players where the last survivor wins.  \u201cApple\u2019s actions will \u2018break\u2019 Fortnite for millions of existing players,\u201d Sweeney wrote, saying Epic updates the game every few weeks. \u201cBecause iOS users can no longer update the game, they will be unable to play Fortnite with most other players, who will have the then-current version available on other platforms\u201d such as PCs.  The videogame maker also said Apple will terminate all of Epic Games\u2019 developer accounts and cut it off from its development tools starting Aug. 28.  In addition to making its own titles, Epic also makes tools for other game developers such as the Unreal Engine, which helps game developers create three-dimensional graphics. The tool is also used by medical imaging companies and car designers and is used by millions of developers, Epic said.  In its filing, Epic alleged that if Apple cuts off its access to Apple\u2019s developers, it will be unable to keep offering the Unreal Engine for Mac and iPhone operating systems, which would in turn affect hundreds of game titles. Some of the games, such as PUBG, have hundreds of millions of players, Epic wrote in its filing.  \u201cThe effects will reverberate well beyond video games; it will affect developers who use the Unreal Engine on Apple products in many fields,\u201d Epic said in its filing asking the court to issue an order blocking Apple\u2019s move. \u201cThe ensuing impact on the Unreal Engine\u2019s viability, and the trust and confidence developers have in that engine, cannot be repaired with a monetary award.\u201d  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Apple has in the past worked closely with Epic to make Unreal Engine work better on its devices.

Last week, a separate document released by a tech watchdog group showed the Texas attorney general might sue Apple for such violations in connection with a multi-state probe, without specifying charges.  In the ongoing probe since at least October 2018, investigators have asked Apple for data about \u201cunexpected shutdowns\u201d of iPhones and the company\u2019s throttling, or slowing down, of the devices through power management software, documents Reuters obtained through a public records request showed.  The attorneys general offices in Arizona and Texas declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Apple came under fire in 2017 when Primate Labs, the maker of software for measuring a phone\u2019s processor speeds, revealed that some iPhones became slower as they aged.  Apple later acknowledged that it reduced power demands - which can slow the processor - when an aging phone\u2019s battery struggles to supply the peak current the processor demands. Apple said without its adjustments, iPhones would have unexpectedly shut down from power spikes.  Outraged iPhone users said that appeared to confirm long-held suspicions that Apple slowed older devices to encourage users to buy new phones. Apple publicly apologized and slashed prices on battery replacements.  Earlier this year, Apple agreed to pay up to $500 million to settle a proposed class-action lawsuit related to the battery issues.

Director Steven Spielberg speaks during an Apple special event at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California, U.S., March 25, 2019. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  The Apple TV+ service features original content from Hollywood heavyweights like Steven Spielberg, J.J. Abrams and M. Night Shyamalan and will launch this fall. It will be ad-free and available on Apple devices as well as other platforms such as Roku and Amazon Fire TV.  But Apple did not announce pricing or confirm whether the new service would be available on Android devices.  In addition to Apple TV+, in May Apple is launching Apple TV Channels, which will allow users to subscribe to individual streaming services.  Apple TV Channels include HBO, Showtime, Starz and others, and will live inside the company\u2019s newly designed Apple TV app. Notably, Apple TV Channels excludes Netflix content.  Apple does not yet offer a discounted bundle of other companies\u2019 streaming services. That would have given it an edge over Amazon.com Inc, which through its Prime Video Channels allows Prime members to subscribe to individual streaming services at full price.  Like Apple, Amazon is making a push into original programing as a way to sell other services. But Prime Video viewers also get the benefits of the fast Amazon order delivery and other perks that come with Prime membership, so may be unlikely to scrap that service for Apple.  And unlike Hulu and Netflix, Apple TV+ will not come stocked with a library of popular broadcast shows. Netflix is said to have paid $100 million to continue licensing the NBC hit series \u201cFriends,\u201d which is reportedly its second-most-watched show. Hulu, starting at $5.99 a month, streams classic series like \u201cSeinfeld\u201d as well as current shows.  Walt Disney Co is also jumping into the streaming war with Disney+, a streaming service armed with the entire library of Walt Disney Studios\u2019 theatrical releases and Disney-branded television shows as well as new, exclusive content.  Dsney has also suggested it could bundle Disney+ with ESPN+ and Hulu, of which it owns a majority stake after its acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets.

But two of the iPhone maker\u2019s most important storefronts were open the whole time: The App Store and Apple\u2019s content businesses such as music and streaming video.  When Apple reports earnings Thursday, investors will be keen to see if its services segment raked in enough to help offset expected declines in most hardware sales and uncertainty about the timing of this fall\u2019s iPhone lineup, historically the company\u2019s biggest sales driver.  Analysts expect pandemic disruptions to pull down total revenue about 3% year-over-year to $52.1 billion and Apple\u2019s bellwether iPhone business by nearly 14% in the third quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv as of July 28.  The two expected growth spots are services revenue - expected to be up 15% to $13.18 billion - and revenue from the companies wearables segment, expected to rise 8.6% to $6 billion, according to Refinitiv data on July 28.  Investors have viewed Apple as a comparative safe haven during the pandemic, pushing up shares 65% since mid-March when much of the world was urged to stay home to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.  When Apple last reported its fiscal second quarter in April, the company did not give a forecast. Analysts do not expect it to give a forecast when it reports this week but will be listening for clues about whether iPhone production for this fall is on track after reports of production delays because of the pandemic.  Analysts are also likely to watch for clues about whether the budget iPhone SE, priced at $399 and released in April, is helping Apple gain or retain customers.  Twenty-nine analysts rate Apple \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201cstrong buy\u201d and seven say \u201chold\u201d and three have \u201csell\u201d or lower ratings.","1620":"(Recasts lead, adds comment)  Jan 8 (Reuters) - Owners of the two biggest mobile app stores took action on Friday against the Parer social networking service because of posts inciting violence, with Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google removing it and Apple Inc warning it may do the same.  Google said the app favored by many supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump must demonstrate \u201crobust\u201d content moderation if it wants to get back in the store. Apple gave the service 24 hours to submit a detailed moderation plan, pointing to participants using the service to coordinate Wednesday\u2019s siege of the U.S. Capitol building.  The actions by the two Silicon Valley companies mean that the network seen as a haven for people expelled from Twitter could become unavailable for new downloads on the world\u2019s main mobile phone app stores within a day. It would still be available in mobile browsers.  Parler Chief Executive John Matze said in posts on his service on Friday that Apple was applying standards to Parler that it did not apply to itself and the companies were attacking civil liberties. He added in a text message to Reuters, \u201cCoordinating riots, violence and rebellions has no place on social media.\u201d  Right-leaning social media users in the United States have flocked to Parler, messaging app Telegram and hands-off social site Gab, citing the more aggressive policing of political comments on mainstream platforms such as Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc. Twitter permanently suspended President Trump\u2019s account on Friday.  In suspending the service, Google, whose software powers Android phones, cited its policy against apps that promote violence and gave recent examples from Parler, including a Friday post that began \u201cHow do we take back our country? About 20 or so coordinated hits\u201d and another promoting a \u201cMillion Militia March\u201d on Washington.  In a statement, Google said that \u201cfor us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content. In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app\u2019s listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues.\u201d  In a letter from Apple\u2019s App Store review team to Parler seen by Reuters, Apple cited participants of the mob storming the U.S. Capitol building on Wednesday.  \u201cContent that threatens the well-being of others or is intended to incite violence or other lawless acts has never been acceptable on the App Store,\u201d Apple said in the letter.  Apple gave Parler 24 hours to \u201cremove all objectionable content from your app ... as well as any content referring to harm to people or attacks on government facilities now or at any future date.\u201d The company also demanded that Parler submit a written plan \u201cto moderate and filter this content\u201d from the app.  Apple declined to comment.  Matze, who describes himself as libertarian, founded Parler in 2018 as a \u201cfree-speech driven\u201d alternative to mainstream platforms but began courting right-leaning users as prominent supporters of Trump moved there.  Those who have joined include commentator Candace Owens, Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and right-wing activist Laura Loomer, who handcuffed herself to the door of Twitter\u2019s New York office in Nov. 2018 to protest a ban on her by the site. In November, conservative activist Rebekah Mercer confirmed that the she and her family, which includes her father and hedge-fund investor Robert Mercer, have provided funding to Parler.  \u201cApparently they believe Parler is responsible for ALL user generated content on Parler,\u201d Matze said in one of his posts. \u201cBy the same logic, Apple must be responsible for ALL actions taken by their phones. Every car bomb, every illegal cell phone conversation, every illegal crime committed on an iPhone, Apple must also be responsible for,\u201d he wrote.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The move is the latest salvo in a long-running cold war between two of the world\u2019s most powerful tech companies, which have clashed over their approaches to user privacy as both face regulatory scrutiny over alleged anticompetitive behavior.  Facebook said it requested the waiver so that small businesses would not have to pay Apple\u2019s cut for a new paid online events product the world\u2019s biggest social media company is launching on its core platform.  Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  On Thursday, Apple removed popular video game \u201cFortnite\u201d from its app store for violating its in-app payment guidelines, sparking a backlash online and prompting developer Epic Games to file a federal antitrust lawsuit challenging Apple\u2019s rules.  Apple takes a cut of between 15% and 30% for most app subscriptions and payments made inside apps, though there are some exceptions for companies that already have a credit card on file for iPhone customers if they also offer an in-app payment that would benefit Apple.  Developers have long criticized the commissions, as well as Apple\u2019s prohibitions on courting customers for outside sign-ups, and what some developers see as an opaque and unpredictable app-vetting process.  A mock-up of the new events product on iPhone, provided by Facebook, showed that the company planned to tell users that Apple would take 30% of the purchase.  Google GOOGL.O also typically takes a 30% commission for payments within apps on its Android devices, although it was not immediately clear whether it would assess a charge in this case. In its Android mock-up, Facebook noted only that it would not take a fee, without disclosing its arrangement with Google.  Google declined to comment on its fee arrangement for the product, and Facebook did not respond to the request for comment.  Facebook also did not say whether it had tried to make use of Apple\u2019s \u201cmultiplatform\u201d exceptions.  The disclosure is likely to touch a nerve with Apple, whose App Store rules bar developers from discouraging the use of its in-app purchase system. Spotify in the past has said Apple rejected its attempts to communicate with users about the fee structures.  Fidji Simo, who heads the core Facebook app, announced the tool in a media conference call featuring small business owners who praised it as a way to reach customers and earn revenue online during the coronavirus pandemic.  She said Facebook considered it \u201cimportant to be transparent, when people are supporting small businesses,\u201d as users might not be aware that part of their payments could be \u201cgoing to an almost $2 trillion company.\u201d  Asked if she thought Apple would approve the change, even with language about fees that could discourage users from using the in-app purchase mechanism, she said she expected to find out \u201cin the next couple days.\u201d","1624":"March 25 (Reuters) - Apple Inc\u2019s new Apple News+ service consolidates popular newspaper and magazine subscriptions, which could appeal more to casual readers suffering from subscription fatigue than long-time fans of specific publications.  Avid readers of magazines like The New Yorker or newspapers like the Wall Street Journal may still keep individual subscriptions for full access to archives or to show support for their favorite publications directly.  But at $10 per month, Apple\u2019s service might be attractive to casual readers who want to peruse a few articles each month from a variety of news sources.  The Wall Street Journal and the Los Angeles Times will be part of the service, Apple announced on Monday. The financial news-focused Wall Street Journal will hire reporters to produce more general news content, the Journal has reported. A monthly digital subscription to the Wall Street Journal costs $39 per month.  Magazines from Conde Nast and Hearst, including The New Yorker and Vanity Fair, are also included with Apple\u2019s revamped news offering. They will be among the 300 magazines available with Apple News+, along with Wired and National Geographic.  The two publishing houses, along with Meredith Corp, which publishes People and InStyle magazines, formed an unlimited magazine-reading app called Texture that Apple bought in March 2018.  It was unclear whether Apple News+ will include both the digital and print content of the participating magazines, or complete access to newspapers\u2019 content.  Magazine subscription costs vary widely. A yearly digital subscription to the New Yorker costs $100, while a digital subscription to Vanity Fair costs $20. Apple said subscribing to all the publications separately would cost a reader $8000 per year.  The New York Times, the largest U.S. newspaper by subscribers, is unlikely be part of Apple\u2019s news service.  Apple said the service will not allow advertisers to track what users read, and Apple itself will not have that data. The focus on privacy comes after numerous data scandals in the tech industry over the past year.  New York Times Chief Executive Mark Thompson previously told Reuters that the company was \u201cleery\u201d about consumers reading its journalism on other platforms and warned publishers of how Netflix disrupted the movie studio business and gained leverage by taking control of distribution.  The New York Time\u2019s subscription revenue grew 3 percent in 2018 from the previous year while its advertising revenue was stagnant. Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google have gained a near duopoly on digital advertising.

The bug appears to rely on Apple\u2019s group video-calling feature.  \u201cWe need a full accounting of the facts to confirm businesses are abiding by New York consumer protection laws and to help make sure this type of privacy breach does not happen again,\u201d Cuomo said in a statement.  Apple said on Monday it will release a fix in a software update later this week.  The company was not immediately available for comment.","1626":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O on Wednesday rolled out an online tool to users in the United States and several other countries to download, change or delete all the data that the iPhone maker has collected on them.  Apple updated its privacy website with the tool, which was unveiled earlier this year for users in the European Union in response to the region\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. Apple will now let users in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand see and download all information that Apple has collected on them. It also gives users a simpler way to make changes to the data, suspend their Apple account or even permanently delete it.  Apple previously offered those functions in different places but brought them together for Europe\u2019s data privacy law. It plans to roll out the same tool for all users around the world by the end of the year.  Apple devices such as the iPhone or Apple Watch collect detailed data about users, such as whom they email, call or text message and even biometric data such as heart rates and fingerprints. But Apple\u2019s practice has been to keep much of that data on the devices themselves and encrypt it with the user\u2019s pass code, meaning that Apple does not possess the data and cannot unscramble it if asked to do so by law enforcement officials.  Apple has sought to turn its privacy stance into a business advantage against its technology industry rivals, with Chief Executive Tim Cook saying that Apple \"wouldn't be in this situation\" earlier this year when Facebook Inc FB.O came under scrutiny for the misuse of its data by Cambridge Analytica. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg in turn called Cook's comments \"extremely glib.\"  Despite its focus on keeping data on devices, Apple does collect and store some data about its users. With the updates to its privacy website Wednesday it is seeking to better explain those instances. For example, Apple collects data on users\u2019 reading habits to improve suggestions in its Apple News app, but it says that data is linked to an anonymous identifier, rather than a personal profile, and that it is not connected to its other services and can be reset at any time.  Apple also expanded its guide for users on how to adjust their privacy settings. For example, Apple\u2019s default settings allow some advertising tracking in is App Store and Apple News, but it explains how users can limit that tracking.","1627":"* SSEC ends down 1.2 pct, blue-chips down 1.5 pct  * Trump threatens new duties on $267 bln of Chinese goods  * Apple suppliers fall after Trump says Apple should make products in U.S.  SHANGHAI, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Stocks in China ended lower Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on nearly all of China\u2019s exports to the United States, and as a tweet from Trump shook suppliers of tech giant Apple.  ** At the close, the Shanghai Composite Index was down 32.81 points or 1.2 percent at 2,702.30. ** The blue-chip CSI300 index was down 1.45 percent, with its financial sector sub-index lower by 0.94 percent, the consumer staples sector down 0.68 percent, the real estate index up 0.9 percent and healthcare sub-index down 1.85 percent. ** Around the region, MSCI\u2019s Asia ex-Japan stock index was weaker by 1.18 percent, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei index closed up 0.3 percent. ** Trump warned on Friday he was ready to slap tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports into the United States, threatening duties on another $267 billion of goods on top of $200 billion in imports primed for levies in coming days. ** China said on Friday it will increase export tax rebates for 397 items ranging from some steel products to electronic ones, in a bid to boost prospects for shipments amid its trade war with the United States. ** China\u2019s trade surplus with the United States widened to a record in August even as the country\u2019s export growth slowed slightly, an outcome that could push President Donald Trump to turn up the heat on Beijing in their cantankerous trade dispute. ** Shares in China-based Apple concept firms fell after U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted on Saturday that Apple Inc should make products in the United States if it wanted to avoid tariffs on Chinese imports. ** Shares in Apple suppliers Luxshare Precision Co Ltd , Shenzhen Sunway Communication Co Ltd and Suzhou Dongshan Precision Manufacturing Co Ltd ended down 10 percent. ** The smaller Shenzhen index ended down 1.84 percent and the start-up board ChiNext Composite index was weaker by 2.41 percent. ** China\u2019s annual consumer inflation accelerated to 2.3 percent in August, the fastest pace since February this year and beating expectations, official data showed on Monday. ** Around the region, MSCI\u2019s Asia ex-Japan stock index was weaker by 1.11 percent, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei index closed up 0.3 percent. ** At 07:14 GMT, the yuan was quoted at 6.8601 per U.S. dollar, 0.16 percent weaker than the previous close of 6.8492. ** The largest percentage gainers in the main Shanghai Composite index were Henan Pinggao Electric Co Ltd, up 10.08 percent, followed by SEC Electric Machinery Co Ltd, gaining 10.04 percent and Shangying Global Co Ltd, up by 10.02 percent. ** The largest percentage losses in the Shanghai index were Dynagreen Environmental Protection Group Co Ltd down 10.02 percent, followed by Jiangsu Yangnong Chemical Co Ltd losing 10 percent and Anhui Great Wall Military Industry Co Ltd down by 9.98 percent. ** So far this year, the Shanghai stock index is down 19.3 percent, the CSI300 has fallen 19.9 percent while China\u2019s H-share index listed in Hong Kong is down 11.3 percent.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Son's presentations are more akin to the performances of Apple Inc AAPL.O co-founder Steve Jobs than the data-dense displays common in corporate Japan, with slides becoming an enduring part of the chief executive's sales pitch.  While striking some observers as comical, the images, mixed with charts showing free cash flow and dividend policy, often outline central tenets of the businessman\u2019s thinking.  Notable examples include SoftBank as a golden egg-laying goose that will reward with patience, or as tofu representing corporate wealth that the tech conglomerate will in the future churn out like a factory.  \u201cHow rare is that in a leadership communication in Japan?\u201d said public relations consultant Bob Pickard, who advises CEOs. Such images play a major role in driving news coverage and chatter on social media, he said.  Son has recently returned to Twitter, tweeting this week, \u201cthe reason for failure lies not externally but within yourself\u201d. But presentations remain the primary method for publicly advancing his ideas, with slides including soaring multi-coloured unicorns representing billion-dollar startups.  To convey his technological utopian vision he uses not only slides but slogans in the simple English favoured by Japanese companies targeting their domestic base. SoftBank looks beyond merely maximising shareholder returns with its corporate philosophy of \u201cinformation revolution - happiness for everyone\u201d.  However, his optimism is meeting brute reality as the coronavirus crashes the global economy and hammers Son\u2019s investments.  Son relies on a simple narrative couched with ample small print legalese, said Pickard, with this week\u2019s argument that \u201cwinged unicorns\u201d will escape the \u201cvalley of the coronavirus\u201d.  \u201cHe runs the risk of not being taken seriously and becoming a caricature,\u201d Pickard said.","1629":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google on Friday updated technical details of the coronavirus contact tracing system they plan to release next month, saying new features would strengthen privacy protections and give health authorities more detailed data.  FILE PHOTO: A 3D printed Google logo is placed on the Apple Macbook in this illustration taken April 12, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The system announced on April 10 will use Bluetooth technology to let authorities build apps to alert people who have been in proximity with those who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus.  The technology does not employ GPS location data and stores most sensitive data in a decentralized way on users\u2019 phones. The approach opened a rift with European governments planning systems that would store data on centralized servers.  Without the Apple-Google technology, apps built by those governments will face limitations such as needing a phone\u2019s screen to be unlocked to work properly.  Health and privacy researchers also cited privacy concerns that the companies addressed on Friday by making it harder to use system-generated data to track people.  The numbers that identify users will be randomly generated, and so-called \u201cmetadata\u201d such as Bluetooth signal strength and users\u2019 phone models will now be encrypted along with primary data about who they have been near.  \u201cExposure time,\u201d or how long two phones have been near each other, will be rounded to 5-minute intervals, to prevent using detailed time data to match up phones to people.  The companies also sought to address health researchers\u2019 concerns that the system would be ineffective. Since Bluetooth signals can penetrate some walls and can be detected even when brief and faint, researchers worried about false alerts from neighbors in apartment buildings or passers-by in public spaces.  Apple and Google will now provide data about Bluetooth power levels to better estimate how close two phones came to each other and for how long, letting authorities set their own thresholds for when to alert people.  The companies also said they would provide data on how many days had passed since the last contact with an infected person, to help authorities notify users about what steps to take.","1630":"BERLIN (Reuters) - An Apple collaboration with Google will make it quicker to get systems for tracing coronavirus infections up and running, the prime mover behind a European effort to support the smartphone technology says.  FILE PHOTO: A 3D printed Google logo is placed on the Apple Macbook in this illustration taken April 12, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  Technologists are racing to use Bluetooth short-range communications between devices as a proxy for measuring the risk that a person infected with the coronavirus can pass it on.  Apple AAPL.O and Alphabet's GOOGL.O Google said last week that they would launch tools to support such applications in May, with full integration of Bluetooth contact tracing functions into their operating systems to follow.  Chris Boos, who is championing the Pan-European Privacy Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT www.pepp-pt.org) technology platform, says this can help shorten the path to deployment.  \u201cWe need to worry less about operating system stability and device calibration,\u201d Boos, the founder of German business process automation startup Arago, said in written answers to Reuters.  PEPP-PT plans a progress update on Friday.  CHAIN OF INFECTION  The coronavirus can be spread by people who show no symptoms, increasing the urgency of efforts once an individual tests positive to break the chain of infection.  Digital technology can help give people targeted warnings to see their doctors or self-isolate, its backers say, reducing the need for lockdowns that have caused huge economic disruption.  Bluetooth advocates say it would be a more accurate and less intrusive way of logging the closeness and duration of personal contacts than location tracking based on networks or satellites.  But a divide has opened up between supporters of decentralized systems - including Apple and Google - and advocates of a centralised approach in which sensitive data is held on a server. The latter includes some governments, raising concerns that they could put citizens under surveillance.  PEPP-PT, being developed in partnership with Germany\u2019s Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute and technologists from other European countries, would support both models.  \u201cA centralized model offers such much better pandemic management potential without infringing privacy,\u201d Boos said.  \u201cBut it should be a country\u2019s choice. You can gather the same data on top of a decentralized model - it just means more people have to move data on infected people.\u201d  PEPP-PT is undergoing certification by Germany\u2019s cybersecurity watchdog and has drawn support from some leaders in Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government.  No decision has yet been made, however, to endorse an official contact-tracing app to run on PEPP-PT that experts say here would need to be downloaded by at least 60% of the population to help achieve so-called digital herd immunity.","1631":"FILE PHOTO: The various colors of newly released Apple iPhone XR are seen following the product launch event at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O on Thursday changed how it reports on U.S. national security requests for user data, bringing its procedures more in line with those of technology rivals such as Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google.  In its first-half 2018 transparency report on government data requests to its website, Apple separated out National Security Letters and requests under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. Apple had combined numbers for the two items since it began reporting them in 2014.  Apple had previously published its aggregate number sooner than other technology companies that broke them out separately because the FISA numbers are subject to a six-month reporting delay by law.  Apple will also report the number of FISA requests for a user\u2019s content versus those not inquiring about such content.  The changes will mean longer delays in Apple\u2019s reporting of overall national security requests. But the new format is similar to those for companies such as Microsoft and Google, making it easier for researchers and the public to compare.  From January through June, Apple received 0 to 499 National Security Letters, which function somewhat like subpoenas, related to 1,000 to 1,499 users, the company said. Because of the reporting changes, Apple did not cite the number of FISA requests received for the first half of 2018 but will do so after Dec. 31.  Apple on Thursday also changed the way it presents data on government requests, launching an interactive website that makes it easier for consumers to look up government data requests in their home country. It also offered the raw data in a format that makes it easier for researchers to upload into software programs.  Apple said it received 4,177 \u201caccount requests\u201d from the government related to 40,641 users. Law enforcement officials can seek information such as stored photos, email, device backups that might include text messages, contacts or calendars.  Earlier this year, Apple said it was streamlining the online tools it offers for law enforcement officials to request data and would offer training courses on what kind of data officials can obtain from the iPhone maker.","1632":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O said on Thursday it will host an event on Sept. 12 at the Steve Jobs Theater in the company's Cupertino, California, campus, where it is widely expected to unveil new iPhone models.  Analysts believe Apple plans to release three new smartphones this year, including one with a larger display than previous models. Analysts also expect Apple to release an iPhone with a edge-to-edge display similar to the iPhone X but using less-costly LCD screen technology.  Apple\u2019s event invitation made heavy use of the color gold, fueling speculation on social media that the company plans to launch a gold-colored successor to the iPhone X, which was made available only in silver and gray last year.  Documents filed at the U.S. Federal Communications Commission unsealed earlier this year showed Apple had sought approval for a gold version of its iPhone X, but it never released the color.  A few hours after Apple\u2019s announcement, 9to5Mac, a technology news website, posted photographs of two gold iPhone models stacked on top each other, with a larger-screened model on the bottom. Both models resemble the current iPhone X.  The site said the new flagship model will be called the iPhone XS and that Apple also plans to release a new version of the Apple Watch with a larger display by reducing the edges around it.  9to5Mac told Reuters the photographs were not mockups and represented Apple\u2019s actual planned products but declined to say how it had obtained them. Apple did not respond to requests for comment about the authenticity of the photos.  Apple shares were up 2.2 percent at an all-time high of $227.97.  Apple has for years released its new phone models in the second week of September, and often updates other product lines such as the Apple Watch at the event. The company has already given base-model iPads and some MacBook laptops an update this year.  Apple typically starts selling new iPhones a few weeks after launching them, in time for the holiday shopping season. The iPhone X, priced at $999 and up, has helped Apple beat Wall Street sales expectations.  Investor Warren Buffett, speaking on Thursday to CNBC, said the iPhone is \u201cenormously underpriced\u201d even when it costs $1,000, given how indispensable it has become for so many people.  (The story corrects spelling of Warren Buffett\u2019s name in final paragraph.)","1633":"SEOUL\/SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Executives in Hyundai Motor Co Group are divided over a potential tie-up with Apple Inc, with some raising concerns about becoming a contract manufacturer for the U.S. tech giant, dimming the outlook for a deal.  Hyundai said earlier this month it was in preliminary talks with Apple, but gave no details. Local media said the firms were discussing an electric car and battery tie-up.  Apple declined to comment.  Apple has never acknowledged talks with the automaker about building vehicles, and it was unclear whether any such talks are still active. The iPhone maker typically insists on strict secrecy from its potential partners and suppliers about future plans or unreleased products.  In an earnings call on Tuesday in which it reported its best quarterly profit in over three years, Hyundai did not give any updates on talks with Apple or indicate whether they remain active.  \u201cWe are agonizing over how to do it, whether it is good to do it or not,\u201d said a Hyundai executive aware of the internal discussions on the tie-up with Apple. \u201cWe are not a company which manufactures cars for others. It is not like working with Apple would always produce great results.\u201d  Few details are known about the talks between the two companies. But people close to the discussions say the options considered included Hyundai or Kia acting as a manufacturer for vehicles designed by Apple and sold under its powerful, ubiquitous brand.  Hyundai is traditionally known for its reluctance to work with outsiders, making engines, transmissions and even its own steel in-house under its vertically integrated supply chain as South Korea\u2019s second-largest conglomerate. Although shares in Kia and Hyundai have surged because of the talks, there is considerable opposition to becoming an Apple contract manufacturer, which could hold up any deal with the American giant, these people said.  Apple and Hyundai first started talks over a car partnership in 2018, when Apple\u2019s effort, known as \u201cProject Titan,\u201d was headed by Alexander Hitzinger, who is now a Volkswagen executive, said a person familiar with the matter.  But progress was hampered by the South Korean automaker\u2019s reluctance to work with outsiders, the person said.  These talks have not been previously reported.  \u201cIt is really difficult (for Hyundai) to open up,\u201d this person said, adding that the South Korean company would likely to have to replace some executives to avoid a culture clash under any partnership with Apple.  \u201cApple is the boss. They do their marketing, they do their products, they do their brand. Hyundai is also the boss. That does not really work,\u201d the person said.  The South Korean car manufacturer, however, has excess capacity. Contract manufacturing would help it secure production volume.  NOT LIKE FOXCONN  Another person familiar with the matter said Apple would prefer to source major components of its own design - frames, bodies, drive trains, and other parts - from a variety of places and rely on Hyundai or Kia for a final assembly site.  \u201cThey would want this to be in the United States,\u201d the second person said.  While the talks are at an early stage, Hyundai Motor Group has \u201ctentatively decided\u201d that it would want Kia to partner with Apple, not Hyundai Motor, a Hyundai insider said.  \u201cThe Group is concerned that the Hyundai brand would become just Apple\u2019s contract manufacturer, which would not help Hyundai in its effort to build a more premium image with its Genesis brand,\u201d the insider said. Kia is also moving faster in terms of electric cars, and it has available production capacity at its Georgia factory in the United States.  Another executive at Hyundai said: \u201cTech firms like Google and Apple want us to be like (contract phone maker) Foxconn.  \u201cA cooperation may initially help raise the brand image of Hyundai or Kia. But in the mid- or longer-term, we will just provide shells for the cars, and Apple would do the brains.\u201d  Nevertheless, there are broad areas where the two companies could benefit, including access to Hyundai\u2019s electric car platform and its suppliers, such as battery makers, as well as access to Apple\u2019s autonomous vehicle stack and software, said Park Chul-wan, a South Korean battery expert and a professor at Seojeong University.  \u201cHyundai would be more than just a Foxconn,\u201d he said.

Shares in Apple, which reported a surprise improvement in its fortunes in China earlier this week, sank 2.5% in morning trade, adding to similar losses a day earlier after Trump tore up a trade truce with China that had lasted just over a month.  The United States and China have been locked in a trade war marked by tit-for-tat tariffs since last year. The tensions have disrupted global supply chains and roiled financial markets.  The BofA note also provided for the possibility that Apple might raise prices of iPhones by around 10%, reducing demand by 20% or around 10 million units.  Apple effectively cut iPhone prices in China earlier this year after currency exchange rates had made the phones too expensive for many Chinese consumers.  Globally, iPhone sales fell 12% to $25.99 billion in the latest reported quarter, after dropping 17% in the second quarter.","1635":"FILE PHOTO: A sign to the campus offices of chip maker Broadcom Ltd is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., November 6, 2017.

The narrowed forecast comes in largely below analysts\u2019 estimates of $5.015 billion.  Several other Apple suppliers such as contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, Corning Inc and AMS have also pointed to soft demand from smartphone customers.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Apple Inc is betting on services such as app downloads and music subscriptions to help drive growth as the cell phone market matures, but the company faces tough competitors and potentially low profit margins in some of its target areas.  Investors support Apple\u2019s effort to look beyond its signature product, the iPhone, for growth. A 31 percent increase in services revenue to $9.2 billion was a bright spot in earnings reported on Tuesday, lifting overall gross margins as well as sales, the company said.  Apple subscribers, who include customers paying for third-party apps on iPhones, rose 100 million in the last year to 270 million.  But profitability varies widely among service offerings, and some businesses appear to have lower profit margins than the 38.3 percent company-wide figure Apple reported.  The App Store and iCloud storage are similar to high-margin software businesses while entertainment, such as Apple Music and a nascent video business, are similar to lower-margin media businesses.  \u201cSome of these services are for sure going to have much lower margins\u201d than Apple\u2019s core hardware business, said Bob O\u2019Donnell of TECHnalysis Research.  Apple\u2019s music effort likely \u201ccan\u2019t be dramatically different from Spotify or Pandora or any of those companies. My guess is the next few Apple services aren\u2019t going to be investment-light services, with content being the preeminent example.\u201d  Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said he expects services to boost margins but allowed for uncertainties due to product mix.  \u201cAs we\u2019re able to grow the services business, that should provide a positive (to margins), a tailwind,\u201d Maestri said in an interview. \u201cAt the same time, within the services portfolio that we have, we have services that have different levels of profitability, so we also need to take into account the mix of services we\u2019re going to be selling.\u201d  The App Store is the largest component of the services segment, Maestri told Reuters. Apple receives 30 percent of the price of one-time app purchases and purchases made within apps, such as items in video games, and 15 percent of App Store subscriptions to services like Netflix Inc after a year.  That is a high-margin business, but the company has been in it for a decade.  \u201cApp revenue probably hasn\u2019t peaked, but it isn\u2019t the long-term future either,\u201d said Julie Ask, an analyst with Forrester Research.  Apple\u2019s iCloud online storage business revenue rose 50 percent in the most recent quarter, likely with high margins. Dropbox Inc, for example, had gross margins of 68 percent in 2017 when excluding stock compensation costs.  CHALLENGES IN ENTERTAINMENT  Entertainment, though, is a tougher business where Apple may have to spend substantially to compete with entrenched rivals.  Apple has an installed base of 1.3 billion gadgets, but many play competitors\u2019 entertainment.  Apple\u2019s servicers could be \u201chard to grow in the face of the competitive monsters who have more history and deeper relationships with services customers,\u201d said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business.  Apple Music has grown rapidly to 40 million paid users and 8 million trial users since launching in 2015, but its chief rival, Spotify Technology SA, had gross margins of 20 percent for 2017, due to the cost of music rights.  And Apple plans to spend $1 billion developing original video content, although it doesn\u2019t charge for its shows on its Apple TV device. Netflix\u2019s so-called \u201ccontribution margin\u201d for its streaming business - the metric the company uses to gauge margins on that segment - was 37 percent in 2017.  \u201cLook at what Netflix and Amazon are doing. Those guys are spending hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars on content,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.","1637":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O will broadcast an event from its Cupertino, California campus on Tuesday where analysts expect it to show updated Apple Watches, iPads and other devices while reserving an iPhone launch for next month.

REUTERS\/Luis Cortes\/File Photo  Despite pandemic-related disruptions that Apple executives have said will push the release of the iPhone into October, Apple has posted earnings that beat expectations for the past two quarters powered in part by strong sales of work-from-home items such as iPads and laptops and accessories that pair with its flagship smart phones.  While analysts expect an October event for iPhones, Apple teased at new watches with a \u201cTime Flies\u201d caption for its Tuesday event invite sent last week, and analysts expect a new flagship Apple Watch Series 6. Apple has come to dominate the market for smart watches, with Strategy Analytics reporting in May that Apple had 55% market share as of the first quarter.  Because the watch must be paired with an iPhone, analysts believe it plays a strong role in helping Apple retain customers, with longtime Apple Watcher Gene Munster of Loup Ventures saying last week that the 9% of iPhone owners that now own an Apple Watch could expand to 50% in the next decade.  Analysts expect Apple to dive deeper into health and fitness features with the watch. Bloomberg previously reported here that Apple plans to unveil a service offering virtual fitness classes in which the watch could play a role as part of a larger bundle of content and services.  Some analysts also believe Apple might build a way to sense changes in blood oxygen into its newest watches, building on health sensing capabilities after adding a way to take measurements similar to electrocardiogram with its Series 4 watches. However, many prominent Apple analysts and watchers have not confirmed the feature. Apple rival Fitbit Inc FIT.N introduced a way to measure changes in blood oxygen earlier this year.  Apple declined to comment on future products.  Analysts also expect Apple to unveil an update to its iPad Air, which sits between the high-end iPad Pro that has a 3D sensor for augmented reality content and the base model iPad aimed at the education market.  Analysts also expect a new set of over-ear headphones called \u201cAirPods Studio\u201d to complement the company\u2019s AirPods and AirPods Pro wireless ear buds, which have become runaway hits for the company.  \u201cWhile AirPods Studio will be a rounding error in terms of revenue contribution, they represent yet another example of the company integrating a new product into its hardware-software ecosystem,\u201d Munster wrote in a blog post last week.

The antitrust subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee recommended that Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Amazon.com AMZN.O and Facebook FB.O - with a combined market value of over $5 trillion - should not both control and compete in related businesses.  The panel\u2019s report broadly recommended structural separations but stopped short of saying a specific company should be broken up.  The scathing 449-page report - the result of the first such congressional review of the tech industry - suggested expansive changes to antitrust law and described dozens of instances where the companies misused their power.  \u201cTo put it simply, companies that once were scrappy, underdog startups that challenged the status quo have become the kinds of monopolies we last saw in the era of oil barons and railroad tycoons,\u201d the report said.  In anticipation of the report, Amazon warned in a blog post Tuesday against \u201cfringe notions of antitrust\u201d and market interventions that \u201cwould kill off independent retailers and punish consumers by forcing small businesses out of popular online stores, raising prices and reducing consumer choice.\u201d  Google said in a statement that it competes \u201cfairly in a fast-moving and highly competitive industry. We disagree with today\u2019s reports, which feature outdated and inaccurate allegations from commercial rivals about Search and other services.\u201d  Facebook said, \u201cWe compete with a wide variety of services with millions, even billions, of people using them. Acquisitions are part of every industry, and just one way we innovate new technologies to deliver more value to people.\u201d  Apple said, \u201cScrutiny is reasonable and appropriate but we vehemently disagree with the conclusions.\u201d The company also defended its commission rates and said it would issue a more extensive response in the coming days.  After more than a year of investigation involving 1.3 million documents and more than 300 interviews, the committee led by Democratic Congressman David Cicilline found companies were running marketplaces where they also competed, enabling \u201cthem to write one set of rules for others, while they play by another.\u201d  Coming just weeks before the Nov. 3 presidential election, the report became an opportunity for Republicans and Democrats to boost their credibility in the fight against market domination by big tech companies.  That said, Congress is unlikely to act on the findings this year. Since the report reflects the views of the Democratic majority in the House, it signals that if Joe Biden wins the White House, the pressure on the companies could well continue.  Also, the report is likely to inform existing antitrust probes against the companies by the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general.  FILE PHOTO: The logos of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google in a combination photo from Reuters files.  Separately, the U.S. Justice Department is investigating large technology companies and is expected to bring a lawsuit against Google soon.  But the report was split along party lines. Republicans on the committee released two short reports, one authored by Representative Ken Buck and supported by three fellow Republicans, which bashed the companies but said that he would not support any call to break them up.  The other was a letter authored by Representative Jim Jordan who criticized Democrats for not probing Big Tech companies for alleged conservative bias and failing to show that existing antitrust law was inadequate.  RECOMMENDATIONS  The panel recommended companies be prohibited from operating in closely aligned businesses. While they did not name any one company, this recommendation would suggest that Google, which runs the auctions for online ad space and participates in those auctions, should potentially be required to separate clearly, or not even operate, the two businesses. For a factbox, click  Facebook\u2019s acquisition of Instagram in 2012 is another example of this. Instagram at the time was small and insignificant, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg saw its potential and noted that it was \u201cbuilding networks that are competitive with our own\u201d and \u201ccould be very disruptive to us,\u201d the report said.  An email received by the committee on Sunday from an unnamed former Instagram employee disputed Facebook\u2019s contention that the two apps could not easily be pulled apart at this stage.  \u201cThey can just roll back the changes they\u2019ve been making over the past year and you\u2019d have two different apps again,\u201d the person wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s turning something on and off.\u201d  As part of the report, the committee staff drew up a menu of potential changes in antitrust law.  The suggestions ranged from the aggressive, such as potentially barring companies like Amazon.com from operating the markets in which they also compete, to the less controversial, like increasing the budgets of the agencies that enforce antitrust law: the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission.  The report also urged Congress to allow antitrust enforcers more leeway in stopping companies from purchasing potential rivals, something that is now difficult.  The antitrust panel will take up the majority report after the October recess for formal adoption and will have a vote on it, the counsels for the committee said.","1640":"(Reuters) - Wall Street analysts were smitten by a rebound in sales of Apple Inc's AAPL.O iPhones after a year of decline and said strong demand for new models, spurred by trade-in programs and heavy discounts on older models, will drive growth this year.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  At least 15 brokerages raised their price targets on the company\u2019s stock on Wednesday, with D.A. Davidson setting the most bullish price target of $385, well above the stock\u2019s current median price target of $325.  Sales were boosted by the first full quarter of iPhone 11, which is priced $50 less than its iPhone XR predecessor, said Gene Munster, a longtime Apple watcher and managing partner at Loup Ventures.  Shares of the company rose 3% to a record high of $327.25 in early trading, providing the biggest boost to the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX index.  \u201cWe see Apple\u2019s December 2019 quarter as a microcosm for its calendar 2020 performance, with the iPhone, once again, returning to the front and center,\u201d D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte said.  Forte attributed part of the iPhone sales bounce to Apple\u2019s new credit initiatives, which enable consumers to purchase a phone and pay for it in monthly installments without paying interest.  Investors have fretted over the long-term growth prospects of Apple\u2019s phone business, which has been facing increased competition from cheaper phones from Samsung and Huawei.  Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer said the widely touted release of a 5G iPhone later this year would likely boost demand.  Robust demand for iPhones and wearables, including AirPod wireless headphones, during the holiday season helped the company make up for weakness in its services revenue in the company\u2019s fiscal first quarter of 2020 reported on Tuesday.  The services business, which includes the Apple TV+ streaming service, iCloud storage and fees from app developers, has consistently grown over the past two years, reaching $12.7 billion in revenue in the quarter.  Cowen and Co analyst Krish Sankar noted that the services segment reached its $50 billion run rate target ahead of schedule, saying that the company\u2019s pivot to a content-focused recurring revenue model is a powerful long-term earnings driver.  Investors have become excited about services because they believe they will lead to durable profits: the services are sold as a subscription billed each month or year, with most consumers leaving them on autopilot, while a new phone or laptop is often a sporadic purchase every few years, subject to the whims of consumer sentiment.","1641":"* Apple hits $1 trillion in market value  * Tech stocks pull S&P 500, Nasdaq higher  * Trade tensions escalate between United States and China  * Tesla surges after earnings call  * Indexes: Dow flat, S&P up 0.5 pct, Nasdaq up 1.1 pct (Updates to late afternoon, changes dateline to NEW YORK, changes byline)  By Stephen Culp  NEW YORK, Aug 2 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose in afternoon trading on Thursday, driven by Apple shares as the iPhone maker became the first publicly traded U.S. company worth a trillion dollars.

The S&P 500 automobiles index edged down 0.4 percent.  Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, six were in positive territory.  For the second-quarter reporting season, 79.7 percent of the 380 companies that reported so far have posted earnings above analyst estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Chemical producer DowDuPont Inc posted profit that beat consensus estimates for the fourth straight quarter, driven by price increases and strong demand. But it said higher raw material costs would hit all its units in the second half of the year, driving its stock down 2.2 percent.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  The Luxembourg-based General Court in July scrapped the Commission\u2019s 2016 ruling, saying that EU competition enforcers had not met the requisite legal standard to show that Apple had enjoyed an unfair advantage.  Vestager said the case was important, a sign that her drive to get multinationals pay their fair share of taxes would continue unabated.  \u201cThe General Court judgment raises important legal issues that are of relevance to the Commission in its application of State aid rules to tax planning cases,\u201d she said in a statement.  \u201cThe Commission also respectfully considers that in its judgment the General Court has made a number of errors of law,\u201d Vestager said.  She said legislation is required to close the tax loopholes and ensure transparency, in a call to EU countries to revamp rules.  Apple said the court judgment proved it has always complied with Irish laws and that the issue was more about where it should pay taxes rather than the amount.  Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said Ireland has always been clear that the correct amount of Irish tax was paid and that the country provided no state aid to Apple.  The Commission\u2019s case centred on two Irish tax rulings that it said artificially reduced Apple\u2019s tax burden for over two decades, which in 2014 was as low as 0.005%.

The report added to concerns that consumer passion for new editions of the iconic smartphones may be cooling after years of scorching growth, sending shares in Apple and many of its major suppliers lower and weighing on global stock markets.  \u201cThis news needs to be viewed in the context of Apple probably being overly optimistic last year in relation to the prospects for its new phones, leaving it with excess inventory in the first part of this year,\u201d Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said.  \u201cAt least part of this lower order forecast probably relates to Apple just being a little more realistic.\u201d  Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The company sold 217 million iPhones, including its older models, in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. It does not break down the figures by model and is still manufacturing large numbers of earlier versions of the phone.  Factset and Thomson Reuters do not provide estimates for new model iPhone sales.  Some analysts said they already expected Apple to sell fewer phones this year than last as global demand for phones tightens and competitors eat into its sales. The company sold 129.5 million iPhones in the past two quarters, little changed from the same period a year earlier.  Apple's shares fell as much as 2 percent on the report, while those in suppliers AMS AMS.S and Dialog Semi DLGS.DE sank 6 percent and 4.1 percent, respectively. Dialog's shares had slumped 17 percent last Friday after it said Apple would cut orders for its power-management chips by around 30 percent this year.  U.S.-based supplier Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O, Micron Technology MU.O Intel INTC.O, Broadcom Inc AVGO.O and Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O were all down between 1 percent and 4 percent.  Many analysts have said the high price of the iPhone X - which sells for $1,000 and is the first iPhone to sport a new design since the launch of the iPhone 6 in 2015 - is also muting demand for the flagship.  \u201cApple is quite conservative in terms of placing new orders for upcoming iPhones this year,\u201d said one of four industry sources cited by the Nikkei Asian Review.  \u201cFor the three new models specifically, the total planned capacity could be up to 20 percent fewer than last year\u2019s orders.\u201d  Top Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said earlier this week that Apple might cut prices of new iPhones to debut later this year by as much as $300, according to several media reports.  Kuo said that Apple was likely to launch a 6.5-inch OLED \u201cIPhone X Plus,\u201d a second generation of iPhone X and an iPhone with a 6.1 inch screen.  \u201cAs the improvements made to the iPhone each year become increasingly marginal it may become more difficult to convince consumers to pay up for the latest model, when an older generation device is effectively just as good,\u201d said Atlantic Equities\u2019 Cordwell.  While media speculation about demand for the iPhone X swirled in the past six months, Apple\u2019s market value has continued to rise and is now within striking distance of $1 trillion.  D.A.

However, in an attempt to offset the impact of a weakening smartphone market, the company has been focusing on services as a path to growth.  The unit, which includes Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud, posted $9.1 billion in revenue in the second quarter. For the fiscal year 2017, iPhones contributed 62 percent to the company\u2019s total revenue, while services accounted for 13 pct.","1644":"* Apple falls on report of iPhone XR production stand down  * Berkshire gains as Q3 operating profit doubles  * Caution prevails ahead of U.S. midterm election  * Indexes: Dow up 0.33 pct, S&P up 0.07 pct, Nasdaq off 0.83 pct  * (Updates to open)  Nov 5 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose on Monday, supported by energy stocks and strong results from Berkshire Hathaway Inc, while a 3 percent drop in Apple Inc shares dragged down the Nasdaq.

In mainland China, Cook said the overall number of Apple device users had grown in the fiscal third quarter, helping to increase the market for its services, whose sales were up by more than 10% there.  \u201cWe actually grew in mainland China,\u201d Cook told Reuters. \u201cNon-iPhone revenue grew 17%. We grew in every category outside of iPhone.\u201d  But globally, iPhone sales fell 12% to $25.99 billion, after dropping 17% in the previous quarter, and matched Wall Street targets.  Graphic: iPhone fade - tmsnrt.rs\/2yAEoCh  Wearables and other accessories revenue rose nearly 50%, topping expectations.  Services revenue rose 12.6% to $11.46 billion, slowing and slightly missing expectations but setting a new record.  Apple said it expects revenue for the current fiscal fourth quarter of between $61 billion and $64 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $61.02 billion. At the high end of Apple\u2019s forecasted range, sales would beat the prior year\u2019s $62.90 billion in sales, despite the fact that analysts expected continued lackluster iPhone sales until 5G models arrive in 2020.  For the fiscal third quarter ended in June, Apple reported a 1% rise in revenue to $53.8 billion and a 7% drop in earnings per share to $2.18, compared with expectations of $53.39 billion and $2.10 per share, according to Refinitiv data.  Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said he was pleasantly surprised to see iPhone sales declines slow down versus the prior quarter.  \u201cYou really don\u2019t hear people talk about their phones like they did several years ago,\u201d Eddins said. But, \u201cthe key is that when people want to splurge on a phone, they do it with an Apple product.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: A customer checks Apple watches at the grand opening of the new Apple Carnegie Library store in Washington, U.S., May 11, 2019. REUTERS\/Joshua Roberts\/File Photo  Apple did not give the number of active Apple devices, but in January it said it was 1.4 billion, with 900 million of those being iPhones. Investors used the number, called the installed base, as a proxy for how many subscribers it can gain for its services business. Cook told investors on a conference call Tuesday that Apple has 420 million paid subscribers to its own services and third-party apps. The company has set a goal of 500 million by 2020.  Trip Miller, managing partner at Apple shareholder Gullane Capital Partners, said he wants to see services growth return to the 20% range and thinks Apple needs to use its billions in cash to buy media properties to fuel its forthcoming television service.  \u201cYou have to have a bigger installed base and have services that people get value from,\u201d Miller said.  TRADE TENSION STILL LOOMS LARGE  Apple reported results as U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators resumed off-and-on talks. U.S. President Donald Trump has suspended new tariffs on a final $300 billion of Chinese imports, which would include iPhones.  Trade tension has slowed down economic growth in China, a major market for Apple, which effectively cut iPhone prices in China earlier this year after currency exchange rates had made its phones too expensive for many Chinese consumers.  Apple\u2019s market share in China declined to 5.8% from 6.4%, according to market research firm Canalys, in part because smartphone rival Huawei Technologies Co Ltd gained market share to become the top handset seller in the country.  But Apple experienced a smaller market share loss than competitors such as Xiaomi Corp 1810.HK, Oppo and Vivo, according to Canalys data. Cook said that iPhone price adjustments, plus the Chinese government's move to cut phone taxes, helped keep iPhone sales in China from eroding further.  \u201cOur trade-in and financing programs are doing extremely well in China,\u201d Cook told Reuters. \u201cBecause of the active installed base is growing in China, our services business is doing very well, growing double digits.\u201d  Apple shares have gained more than 20% since early June, when shares dropped on news that the U.S. Department of Justice had jurisdiction over the company in a potential probe as part of a broader review of whether technology giants engage in anticompetitive practices.  Apple said revenue for its \u201cWearables, home and accessories\u201d segment that contains devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods was $5.53 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $4.81 billion.  Apple said it returned more than $21 billion to shareholders during the fiscal third quarter, including $17 billion in share repurchases. It declared a dividend of 77 cents per share.","1651":"SAN DIEGO, Calif., April 16 (Reuters) - A trial opened Tuesday in a complex contract and anti-trust dispute between Apple Inc and Qualcomm Inc with the iPhone maker using a fried chicken analogy to explain its claim that the chip company is abusing its market power.  Tens of billions of dollars and the fate of Qualcomm\u2019s business model are at stake in the case. Apple alleges that Qualcomm engaged in illegal patent licensing practices to maintain a monopoly on the market for premium modem chips that connect smart phones to wireless data networks.  Qualcomm in turn says Apple uses innovations that Qualcomm spent billions to develop without proper compensation and that Apple has interfered in Qualcomm\u2019s longstanding business relationships.  A jury of three women and six men will hear the case over five weeks in the San Diego federal courtroom of Judge Gonzalo Curiel. On Tuesday, attorneys sought to cut through the technological complexity and frame key elements of the case in terms the jury could understand.  Apple has objected to a practice that it calls \u201cno license, no chips\u201d under which Qualcomm will not sell chips to a company that has not signed a patent license agreement.  Apple attorney Ruffin Cordell likened Qualcomm\u2019s policy to a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant that refuses to sell a bucket of chicken to customers.  \u201cYou first have to go over to this different counter, KFL - Kentucky Fried Licensing,\u201d Cordell said. \u201cYou have to go pay that \u2018eating license\u2019 fee before they\u2019ll sell you any chicken.\u201d  Qualcomm had not yet given its arguments as of mid-morning, but the company has argued in court papers that its portfolio of 130,000 patents contains technologies used by virtually all mobile devices.  The company\u2019s position is that mobile phone makers need a license to its patents regardless of whether they choose its chips and that it has followed longstanding industry practices by charging a license fee as a percentage of a device\u2019s adjusted selling price.

The bluechip Dow Jones Industrial Average hit its highest since Feb. 1 and is about 2 percent shy of its all-time high hit on Jan. 26. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq had already moved past their January peaks to record highs in prior weeks.

The timing of the talks remains unclear and President Donald Trump said there is no pressure to make a deal.  Still, the trade-sensitive industrial sector rose 0.39 percent. Caterpillar was up 0.7 percent and Boeing rose 0.8 percent.  U.S. consumer prices rose less than expected in August and underlying inflation pressures also appeared to be slowing, a report from the U.S. Labor Department showed.  \u201cTame inflation data is a net positive for markets and this shouldn\u2019t change the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision for two further rate hikes this year,\u201d Antonelli added.

Three S&P sectors were trading lower, with energy stocks down 0.39 percent as oil prices slipped from near four-month highs.  Qualcomm rose 3.9 percent after the chipmaker said it would buy back about $16 billion of its stock.  Chipmakers bounced back from a slide on Wednesday, with the Philadelphia semiconductor index up 1.6 percent.  Kroger slid 9.5 percent, the most on the S&P, after the supermarket chain\u2019s same-store sales missed estimates as customers were put off by changes in how it stocked merchandise.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.53-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.25-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

A legal battle ensued after Epic rolled out its own method of in-game purchases for \u201cFortnite\u201d on Apple\u2019s App Store earlier this month, rather than using Apple\u2019s required in-app purchase system that charges commissions of 30%.  Apple responded by removing Epic\u2019s \u201cFortnite\u201d game from its App Store and by threatening to terminate an affiliated account, a move that would have effectively blocked distribution of Unreal Engine, a software tool relied on by hundreds of other app makers.  Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on Monday blocked Apple from shutting down Unreal Engine, but allowed the iPhone maker to keep \u201cFornite\u201d out of its store until Epic meets Apple\u2019s request to resubmit the app without the direct payment feature.  The judge\u2019s reasoning was that Epic would not face \u201cirreparable harm\u201d by temporarily removing the direct payment feature while its case against Apple proceeds.  \u201cWe agree with Judge Gonzalez Rogers that \u2018the sensible way to proceed\u2019 is for Epic to comply with the App Store,\u201d Apple said on Tuesday.  In a blog post Wednesday, Epic said it disagreed in principle with Apple\u2019s payment rules and would not resubmit \u201cFortnite\u201d to the App Store without the direct payment system.  \u201cTheir proposal is an invitation for Epic to collude with Apple to maintain their monopoly over in-app payments on iOS, suppressing free market competition and inflating prices,\u201d Epic wrote in the post.  \u201cAs a matter of principle, we won\u2019t participate in this scheme.\u201d","1656":"BERLIN (Reuters) - Anglo-German chip designer Dialog Semiconductor DLGS.DE is buying California-based Adesto Technologies IOTS.O for $500 million to diversify further away from its reliance Apple AAPL.O, it said on Thursday.

For Chief Executive Jalal Bagherli, the deal marks another step toward de-risking Dialog after it struck a $600 million deal with Apple in 2018 to hand over people and patents behind the main integrated power-management circuits in the iPhone.  \u201cThe strategic value (of the Adesto deal) is more in the industrial internet of things - smart buildings, smart cities,\u201d Bagherli told Reuters on Thursday.  Adesto provides application-specific semiconductors and embedded systems essential to the so-called internet of things.  Bagherli said he would continue to look for bolt-on deals while avoiding larger, riskier acquisitions. He added that Dialog has sufficient funds to complete the deal and still invest in organic growth and undertake share buybacks.  The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter, subject to regulatory approvals, and increase earnings in the combined group\u2019s first calendar year, Dialog said, with cost annual savings seen at about $20 million.  Adesto expects to report 2019 revenues of about $118 million and Bagherli expects it to continue to generate double-digit revenue growth.  Dialog shares were up 1.3% in early trade.  Commenting on the coronavirus outbreak in China, Bagherli said most companies in the semiconductor industry had been affected by production disruptions these are easing.  \u201cWe were at 10, 20, 30% of capacity a couple of weeks ago.

Taipei-based Foxconn, which manufactures the bulk of Apple\u2019s iPhones in China for sale in the United States, faces even more challenging quarters ahead as Washington plans to impose additional tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese imports including smartphones from Sept. 1.  Foxconn is already battling weak global demand for other electronics devices, which has forced it to consider selling its $8.8 billion display panel factory in China, Reuters reported last week.  To ease the impact of additional U.S. tariffs, Foxconn may consider moving parts of its production lines for Apple to Vietnam and India, Arthur Liao, an analyst at Fubon Research in Taipei, said ahead of the results.  \u201cWe think Vietnam is more likely to be the primary production base for future Apple products as many components can be transported directly by train from China, saving customs-clearance and air-transportation costs,\u201d he said.

A guard stands watch outside the Saudi Embassy building in Washington, U.S., October 5, 2020. REUTERS\/Raphael Satter  The report here on the group, known publicly as Bahamut, the name assigned to the mythical sea monster of Arab lore, highlights how cybersecurity researchers are increasingly finding evidence of mercenaries online.  BlackBerry\u2019s vice president of research, Eric Milam, said the diversity of Bahamut\u2019s activities was such that he assumed it was working for a range of different clients.  \u201cThere\u2019s too many different things going on across too many different ranges and too many different verticals that it would be a single state,\u201d Milam said ahead of the report\u2019s release.  In June, Reuters reported on how an obscure Indian IT firm called BellTroX here offered its hacking services to help clients spy on more than 10,000 email accounts over seven years, including targeting prominent American investors.  BlackBerry - which absorbed antivirus firm Cylance in 2019 - stitched together digital clues left by other researchers over the years to create a picture of a sophisticated group of hackers. BlackBerry also linked the group to mobile phone applications in the Apple AAPL.O and Google GOOGL.O app stores. Those apps, which included a fitness tracker and password manager, may have helped the hackers track their targets, the report said.  A Google spokesman said all the apps in the Google Play Store mentioned in the report had been removed. Apple said two of the seven apps were no longer in its App Store and that it was not provided with enough information about the remaining programs to judge whether they were malicious.  Milam declined to comment on who he thought might be behind Bahamut, but he said he hoped the report would help to sharpen the focus on hackers-for-hire.  Taha Karim, the chief executive of Emirati cybersecurity company tephracore - who was not involved in BlackBerry\u2019s research but reviewed the report ahead of publication - said the findings were credible and \u201cthey found links that aren\u2019t obvious.\u201d  THE TARGETS  BlackBerry did not name any of Bahamut\u2019s targets directly, but researchers have previously publicly identified Middle Eastern human rights activists, Pakistani military officials, and Gulf Arab businessmen as being in the group\u2019s crosshairs. Reuters was also able to identify new targets by cross-referencing data published in BlackBerry\u2019s report with boobytrapped webpages preserved by urlscan.io, a cybersecurity tool.  One heavily targeted organization included the New York-based Sikhs for Justice, a separatist group that\u2019s campaigning for an independent homeland for Sikhs in India. Its founder, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, said his campaign websites have been repeatedly hacked and his emails broken into. Others pursued by the hackers included: The United Arab Emirates\u2019 Ministry of Defense, its Supreme Council for National Security, and Shaima Gargash, the Emirates\u2019 No. 2 diplomat in Washington.  In an email, Gargash said the embassy had no comment.  Saudi officials were also targeted by the hackers. Cached phishing pages preserved by services such as urlscan and reviewed by Reuters showed that the cyber spies targeted Mawthouq, the Saudi government\u2019s email service, half a dozen Saudi government ministries, and the Saudi Center for International Strategic Partnerships, a Riyadh-based body aimed at helping coordinate the petrostate\u2019s foreign policy.  The Saudi Embassy in Washington declined comment.  The hackers pursued royals and business executives in Bahrain, Kuwait, and Qatar. In August 2019 they attempted to compromise an employee of major Indian energy conglomerate Reliance Industries RELI.NS around the time that the company was negotiating the sale of a stake in its oil-to-chemicals business to Saudi Aramco.  Reliance did not return repeated messages. Attempts to reach the hackers were unsuccessful.","1659":"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc said on Wednesday it expected 200 million 5G smartphones to be sold in 2020, including flagship devices launching next fall, a reference Wall Street took as a hint that Apple Inc would offer the faster technology next year.  A Qualcomm sign is seen at the second China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai, China November 6, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song  Next-generation 5G smartphones are expected to make tasks like watching videos or playing games on mobile networks as good as or better than on a Wi-Fi connection.  Once 5G networks are widely available sometime next year, Qualcomm, the world\u2019s largest supplier of mobile phone chips, and its rivals stand to benefit because the phones will require more chips to gain the speed boost.  Apple, a Qualcomm client, has not said when it will launch 5G. But Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer Akash Palkhiwala said on an investor call there would be \u201ctwo inflection points\u201d for 5G chips next year.  One would be in the spring, when firms like Samsung and several Chinese handset makers tend to introduce new phones. \u201cThe second inflection point will be in the fall time frame, when another set of flagship devices will adopt 5G,\u201d Palkhiwala said.  Fall is when Apple and Alphabet Inc launch new models, and Kinngai Chan of Summit Insights Group said he expected Apple to adopt Qualcomm\u2019s 5G modem chip for some those devices.  Qualcomm\u2019s 5G market estimate, disclosed during a fourth-quarter earnings report, is the first from the company.  Rivals MediaTek Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd also will produce 5G chips. Still, Qualcomm stands to reap patent licensing revenue from essentially every 5G device and sell chips for many of the most expensive handsets.  Qualcomm\u2019s 5G devices estimate is nearly 60% higher than research firm IDC\u2019s 123.5 million forecast and Goldman Sachs\u2019 120 million.  Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said Qualcomm\u2019s close relationship with phone makers made its number credible.  \u201cGiven Qualcomm actually has to put orders into its foundries and those numbers were provided on an investor call, I\u2019d bank on the Qualcomm number,\u201d he said.  However, an analyst on Qualcomm\u2019s post-earnings call termed the estimate as \u201cconservative,\u201d comparing it to a 300 million estimate by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, which some reports have said is from a leaked internal document.  And Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein, said the 200 million estimate was not \u201chugely surprising\u201d because it likely factors in the expectation of 5G iPhones in 2020.  \u201cMost estimates for 5G have been going up lately,\u201d Rasgon said.","1660":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department asked a federal judge in San Francisco on Friday to allow the government to bar Apple Inc AAPL.O and Alphabet Inc's Google GOOGL.O from offering WeChat for download in U.S. app stores pending an appeal.

That injunction blocked the U.S. Commerce Department order which was set to take effect late on Sept. 20 and that would also bar other U.S. transactions with Tencent Holding's 0700.HK WeChat, potentially making the app unusable in the United States.  Beeler responded late on Friday by setting a hearing for Oct. 15 on the motion but said she could potentially hold it on \u201ca tighter time period.\u201d  The Justice Department filing said Beeler\u2019s order was in error and \u201cpermits the continued, unfettered use of WeChat, a mobile application that the Executive Branch has determined constitutes a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.\u201d  Tencent had put forward a \u201cmitigation proposal\u201d that sought to create a new U.S. version of the app, deploy specific security measures to protect the new apps source code, partner with a U.S. cloud provider for user data storage, and manage the new app through a U.S.-based entity, the filing said.  However, its proposal still allowed Tencent to retain ownership of WeChat and did not address U.S. concerns over the company, it added.  Tencent declined to comment.  Lawyers for U.S. WeChat Users Alliance, the group behind the legal challenge to the WeChat ban, questioned the urgency of the government\u2019s request, noting the time it took for the government to seek a stay.  \u201cThe government\u2019s decision to sit tight for five days shows that there is no emergency,\u201d they wrote.  In support of its argument, the Justice Department made public portions of a Sept. 17 Commerce Department memo outlining the WeChat transactions to be banned. \u201cThe WeChat mobile application collects and transmits sensitive personal information on U.S. persons, which is accessible to Tencent and stored in data centers in China and Canada,\u201d the memo said.  Beeler said WeChat users who filed a lawsuit \u201chave shown serious questions going to the merits of the First Amendment claim.\u201d  The Justice Department filing said \u201cthe First Amendment does not bar regulation of WeChat simply because it has achieved the popularity and dependency sought by (China), precisely so it can surveil users, promote its propaganda, and otherwise place U.S. national security at risk.\u201d  WeChat has had an average of 19 million daily active users in the United States, analytics firms Apptopia said in early August. It is popular among Chinese students, Americans living in China and some Americans who have personal or business relationships in China.  Beeler wrote \u201ccertainly the government\u2019s over-arching national-security interest is significant. But on this record \u2014 while the government has established that China\u2019s activities raise significant national security concerns \u2014 it has put in scant little evidence that its effective ban of WeChat for all U.S. users addresses those concerns.\u201d  WeChat is an all-in-one mobile app that combines services similar to Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Venmo. The app is an essential part of daily life for many in China and boasts more than 1 billion users.  TikTok on Wednesday sought a similar preliminary injunction from a U.S. judge in Washington.

The Justice Department, which sued the search and advertising giant in October, put at the core of its antitrust case the billions of dollars that Google paid to be the default search engine on Apple\u2019s iPhones, and Apple noted in its filing that sensitive data was used to write the complaint.  The government is accusing Google of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals in a lawsuit that is the biggest challenge to the power and influence of Big Tech in decades.  Google had offered to ensure that any confidential information would be made available solely to two in-house attorneys at the offices of Google\u2019s outside counsel or in another secure manner, adding that it would promptly report any disclosure.

We might still have a chance to make it with overtime, but we also need to monitor consumer sentiment to come for the end products,\u201d the source added.  The reference was to electronics, including smartphones.  Foxconn did not immediately respond to email and telephone calls to seek comment.  Foxconn got the green light this week to reopen major plants in China, and its plant in the eastern city of Kunshan was also approved on Tuesday to resume production, an internal document reviewed by Reuters showed.  But just about a tenth of the workforce had returned to two key plants in southern Shenzhen and central Zhengzhou as of Monday, a source told Reuters.  The two plants make up the bulk of Foxconn\u2019s assembly lines for Apple\u2019s iPhones and further delays to production after the enforced closures could hit global shipments.  Apple estimated first-quarter revenue in a wider range than usual to factor in the virus uncertainty.  On Monday, Foxconn reported a drop of 12% in revenue in January from a year ago, to T$364.6 billion ($12 billion). It did not give details.  Shares of Foxconn, formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, gained 3.1% on Wednesday, outperforming a rise of 0.9% in the benchmark index.  The shares have lost more than 7% since the market reopened after the holiday break.","1663":"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU lawmakers overwhelmingly called on Thursday for rules to establish a common charger for all mobile device makers across Europe, a drive that iPhone maker Apple has criticised.  FILE PHOTO: Silhouette of mobile user is seen next to a screen projection of Apple logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  Members of the European Parliament voted by 582-40 for a resolution urging the European Commission, which drafts EU laws, to ensure that EU consumers are no longer obliged to buy new chargers with each new device.  The Commission should adopt new rules by July, the lawmakers\u2019 resolution said.  The resolution said voluntary agreements in the industry had significantly reduced the number of charger types, but had not resulted in one common standard.  Electronic waste, the resolution said, was some 16.6 kilograms (36.6 pounds) per EU inhabitant in 2016, for a total of 12.3 million tonnes, an unnecessarily large amount.  The resolution also said wireless charging could prove beneficial by mitigating waste, but urged the Commission to adopt rules that ensured wireless chargers were able to charge many different mobile devices.  A move to a common charger would affect Apple more than any other company as iPhones and most of its mobile products are powered by its Lightning cable, whereas Android devices are powered by USB-C connectors.  Apple said last week that the industry was already moving to USB-C and that regulation to force conformity would stifle innovation, harming European consumers. An abrupt switch would itself result in a mountain of e-waste, it said.  The European Commission, which acts as the executive for the EU, has been pushing for a common charger for more than a decade.  In 2009 it got four companies including Apple, Samsung, Huawei [HWT.UL} and Nokia to sign a voluntary memorandum of understanding to harmonize chargers for new models of smartphones coming into the market in 2011.  However, Commission officials say the voluntary approach is not working and the EU executive is now looking into legislation and has included the common charger as one of the set of actions it plans for this year.","1664":"(Reuters) - Shares in Apple Inc AAPL.O edged higher on Friday but stayed close to the $1 trillion valuation milestone the iPhone maker reached a day earlier, even as Wall Street predicted more gains.

The dollar was 1.37 percent lower against the yen at 107.38 yen, while the euro was 0.86 percent lower against the yen.  The yen has surged more than 5 percent in five weeks on mounting worries over the direction of the global economy.  \u201cClearly the Japanese yen is a beloved safe-haven asset when the globe seems to be in chaos,\u201d said Juan Perez, senior currency trader at Tempus Consulting, in Washington.  \u201cThings are consistent in Japan though overall economic growth and certainly inflation have been anemic, but their political situation is stable, they carry a current account surplus, and the rest of the world seems more at the mercy of the U.S.-China trade impasse,\u201d said Perez.  The yen has traditionally been the go-to currency in times of stress because traders believe the legions of Japanese investors holding money overseas will rush back into Japan when markets are in flux.  Earlier in the session, the yen rose to as much as 4.4 percent stronger versus the dollar after a flurry of automated orders triggered a massive move in thinly traded Asian markets.  \u201cThe time between New York close and Asian open is notoriously thin as it is and couple that with a Japan holiday and Apple news that smacked the equity and you had a nice recipe for a sharp JPY rally,\u201d Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies, said in a note.  Investors were spooked by an Apple Inc warning about weak iPhone demand and stock markets fell globally. A break through key technical levels in dollar\/yen markets in early Asian trading triggered massive stop-loss sales, forcing investors to unwind bets against the yen.  The dollar\u2019s recent weakness also reflects concern about the course of the U.S. economy and a drastic shift in investor expectations for interest rate rises, with many now calling the end of the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate-hiking cycle, analysts said.  The dollar fell against the euro on Thursday after data from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), showed the U.S. manufacturing activity index at its lowest since November 2016, following its biggest monthly drop since October 2008.  The Australian dollar, whose fortunes largely depend on the Chinese economy to which Australia sends a bulk of its commodities, fell to a near-decade low before recovering to trade little changed on the day.  Sterling was 0.11 percent lower against the greenback as worries about the health of the global economy and particularly China prompted investors to avoid currencies considered riskier.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar  (Reuters) - Apple Inc said on Wednesday it is expanding a program to supply repair parts, tools and manuals for iPhones to independent repair shops in 32 countries in Europe as well as Canada.  Apple began the program last year in the United States after years of lobbying against state-level \u201cright to repair\u201d bills that would have compelled it to provide parts to independent shops.  Apple has long maintained a network of authorized service providers such as Best Buy Co Inc to perform warranty work, but smaller shops had complained that the program was too costly to join because of high volume commitments, leaving them without access to genuine Apple parts or the software tools needed to perform some repairs.  Apple launched its program for those independent shops last August, making it free to join if technicians complete a training program. Apple said Wednesday that 140 businesses with 700 locations have signed up for the program in the United States. Some of the independent shops, such as uBreakiFix, have multiple locations, while some are sole proprietorships.  \u201cWhen a customer needs a repair, we want them to have a range of options that not only suits their needs but also guarantees safety and quality so their iPhone can be used for as long as possible,\u201d Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, said in a statement.  Under the program, independent shops get access to Apple parts and tools to perform out-of-warranty repairs. They also get Apple parts at the same prices as authorized service centers and can still also use third-party after-market parts and set their own prices. The program only covers iPhones.  Independent shops must inform customers whether they are using genuine Apple parts and send any salvaged Apple parts back to the company, where they are either refurbished or recycled. Apple said it is also creating an online tool to verify whether an independent shop participates in its program.","1671":"(Reuters) - Google\u2019s iPhone apps such as Maps and YouTube will stop using a tool from Apple Inc that allows them to personalize ads, avoiding a new Apple warning that informs users their browsing is being tracked.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  The announcement in a Wednesday blog post by the Alphabet Inc unit comes shortly before Apple is expected to start enforcing new tracking transparency rules.  Apple for years has supplied apps with a unique identifier, known as IDFA, to help them link the same user across multiple programs. The code can be essential in determining to whom to show an ad and tracking whether it prompted them to make a purchase.  But Apple has said that early this year it will require that apps show users a one-time pop-up message to gain their consent to access their IDFA.  Facebook Inc and other app makers are concerned the warning may discourage users from opting in and cripple ad sales.  As users of Google\u2019s apps are typically logged in, it has a tracking alternative to IDFA and as such its core ad business would likely not be affected by Apple\u2019s changes.  But it warned in its blog post that publishers and advertisers that rely on its mobile ad software will experience weaker results without IDFA access.  Google said it is developing alternatives for clients but these may not be ready immediately.  Google added that clients can use its software regardless of whether they show the pop-up and obtain the necessary consent, and it is not making any recommendations on what they should do.  Apple said apps not using IDFA still are required to seek user permission if they show and measure ads based on data acquired from other companies.  To comply, Google said its iPhone apps will stop using data from so-called third parties to personalize ads.  Facebook said last month that it plans to display the pop-up to seek users\u2019 consent.  \u201cApple has made it clear that if we don\u2019t use Apple\u2019s prompt that they will block Facebook from the App Store, which would only further harm the people and businesses that rely on our services every month,\u201d it said.","1672":"(Reuters) - For years, hardware engineers at American consumer electronics firms have hopped on a flight to China to iron out manufacturing kinks on assembly lines, but the COVID-19 pandemic and Sino-U.S. tensions have made travel between the countries difficult.

California-based Instrumental Inc, co-founded by Anna-Katrina Shedletsky and Sam Weiss, has created a system that relies on outfitting manufacturing lines with cameras and then analyzing the images using artificial intelligence software.  To spot a problem, an engineer needs to just log on to the software rather than board a plane.  In the early days of a product, hundreds of issues can crop up and, to fix these, firms \u201csend big groups of people 6,000 miles around the world to go stand on the line in random spots and hope that they catch the problems, by getting lucky being in the right place in the right time,\u201d Shedletsky said.  Cameras and artificial intelligence, by contrast, can spot missing screw, a bent spring or a damaged battery in real time and with high accuracy, she added.  Instrumental\u2019s software system, originally built to identify defects more efficiently and used by firms such as thermal camera maker Flir Systems Inc, has drawn widening interest as the coronavirus has restricted U.S.-China travel.  Air travel to China has become more unclear with President Donald Trump\u2019s administration barring Chinese carriers from flying to America starting June 16 as it pressures Beijing to let U.S. airlines resume flights.  \u201cWhile certain parts of the world can be open and functioning, travel is unlikely to be open and free for a while,\u201d Shedletsky said.

On Tuesday, Apple is expected to unveil updates to several key products, including the Apple Watch and iPad, that will help determine whether it keeps up that streak. The devices will be shown in an event broadcast www.apple.com\/apple-events from its Cupertino, California headquarters starting at 1 p.m. ET (1700 GMT).  As markets closed Monday, Apple shares were up nearly 54% for the year, well ahead of the 22% gain for the Nasdaq. Even though Apple stock has fallen from a record high earlier this month, it remains near its $2 trillion stock market valuation.  How the new products sell during the holiday shopping season in many western markets will largely define how well Apple performs for its entire fiscal year, which started this month.  This year is likely to be different. For one, Apple has said its iPhones - still the company\u2019s biggest seller - will be delayed by several weeks, which eats into the number of days that shoppers have to buy them before the holidays and could lead to lower sales. Analysts expect Apple to unveil a 5G iPhone and other updates at an event in October, with products going on sale later that month.  Part of Apple\u2019s task Tuesday will be to make the case that products like the Apple Watch help keep customers in Apple\u2019s ecosystem over the longer term - even if they do not buy a flagship iPhone as a holiday gift.  \u201cIf sales happen to be softer than usual during the holiday quarter, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re lost just because they\u2019re delayed,\u201d said Ben Bajarin, principal analyst for consumer market intelligence at Creative Strategies.  So far, Apple has racked up a solid record with virtual product launches into a retail environment spotted with closures.

LONDON\/NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Big Tech investors have historically brushed off the threat from Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission\u2019s antitrust tzar who wants to reduce U.S. behemoths\u2019 digital dominance. The combined market value of Apple, Amazon.com, Facebook and Google owner Alphabet has risen more than threefold to $4.4 trillion since the Dane\u2019s first term started in 2014. Two new probes into Apple, launched on Tuesday, suggest that it\u2019s time to start taking her more seriously.  Vestager is concerned that the rules for Apple\u2019s preponderant app store distort competition. Music-streaming rival Spotify Technology complained that Apple levies a 30% \u201ctax\u201d on purchases made within apps by smartphone users, while simultaneously stopping app developers from steering customers to cheaper options. The second probe centres on Apple Pay, which allows customers to buy things using an iPhone. Vestager worries that Apple makes it hard for competing payments systems to work smoothly with its popular smartphones. Apple said it was disappointed that the European Commission \u201cis advancing baseless complaints from a handful of companies who simply want a free ride\u201d.  But Chief Executive Tim Cook \u2013 and the company\u2019s investors \u2013 should be worried. The smartphone market is mature, and that\u2019s a problem for Apple, as it accounts for roughly half of revenue. Sales of iPhone handsets fell 7% in the first quarter of 2020. Apple has compensated by selling more apps, and subscriptions to its gaming and music services. These services are closing in on a quarter of all revenue thanks to rapid growth. Citi analysts reckon that the app store accounts for 30% of all services revenue.  That has convinced the market to revalue Apple, as investors prefer recurring services revenue to one-off hardware sales. The company\u2019s shares are valued at 24 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months, using Refinitiv data. That\u2019s nearly twice as high as the multiple from 2015 until the end of 2018.

It faces an uphill battle when it launches its Apple TV+ streaming service on Nov. 1 for $5 a month against rivals with deeper libraries and years of experience making hit shows.  To quickly build a subscriber base, Apple is offering a year of free service for customers who purchase most Apple devices. Apple TV+ - which at launch will include eight original shows, including \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d featuring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon and \u201cSee,\u201d a sci-fi drama featuring Jason Momoa - will be available in over 100 markets at launch.  The big question is whether those customers will stick around after the free trial ends.  Ahead of the announcement, analysts and investors viewed Apple, which is late to the streaming war, as facing a tough fight competing with Netflix Inc and Walt Disney Co\u2019s Disney+. Apple is also trying to win out over HBO Max with its hit shows like \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201d  Apple\u2019s offerings are dwarfed by the extensive catalog of industry leader Netflix Inc, which has a reported $10 billion budget for content and 151 million paid subscribers.  Walt Disney Co\u2019s Disney+ - launching Nov. 12 - has helped lift the stock almost 20% in recent months. Disney boasts a deep library of Marvel\u2019s superhero hits, the Star Wars universe, \u201cToy Story\u201d creator Pixar animation and the National Geographic channel.  Disney+ has a budget of over $1 billion for original content - a figure that will grow to around $2 billion by 2024. It is priced higher than Apple TV+, at $7 monthly or $70 annually. A bundle that includes ESPN+ and Hulu will cost $13 per month.  Media executives and analysts believe that most households are willing to pay for more than one streaming service. Many believe subscribers are unlikely to cancel their Netflix subscription to pay for other services to pay for Disney+, instead subscribing to both. IAC Chairman Barry Diller told CNBC in July that Disney has the best chance of catching up to Netflix \u201cbecause of its very, very popular content.\u201d  Apple will not directly compete with Amazon Inc\u2019s Prime Video because that service is bundled with other perks of Prime membership - most significantly, free one- or two-day delivery on most Amazon orders.  Next spring, Apple will face another significant rival in television: HBO. AT&T-owned WarnerMedia\u2019s forthcoming HBO Max, likely priced at $16 to $17 per month, has a library of HBO, Warner Bros and other content, and is investing in original content as well.  Apple, which is spending $2 billion on original content this year, is sitting on $210.6 billion in cash. \u201cApple has the firepower to outspend a company like Disney by a wide degree,\u201d said media analyst Rich Greenfield. \u201cIf Apple makes great content, people will subscribe.\u201d  For now, Apple TV+\u2019s greatest advantage is its reach and its scale. With 1.4 billion devices worldwide, free service on most new device sales and a November launch in over 100 markets, it has the potential to do what no other service has done: be everywhere on Day One.

FILE PHOTO: Auto-rickshaws drive past the hoardings of Apple iPhone X mobile phones in Mumbai, India July 27, 2018. REUTERS\/Francis Mascarenhas\/File Photo  Alam, 27, spends hours on his phone watching shows, surfing and shopping, making him the perfect target for Apple Inc as it strives to raise sales among India\u2019s 1.3 billion consumers.  But in a country where the average per capita income is around $2,000 a year, even the cheapest of this year\u2019s new iPhones, the XR at 76,900 rupees ($1,058), costs twice as much as many of the alternatives.  Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Research says that iPhone sales are falling as a result. From three million phones in 2017, sales may sink to two million this year, according to their estimate, the first decline in four years.  More than half of those sales will come from cheaper older models, and the lack of progress in India was among problems cited by Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook when he gave a disappointing holiday outlook last week.  Even in the premium segment, smartphones that cost more than $400, Apple lagged Samsung and China\u2019s OnePlus in the third quarter.  \u201cI have never used an iPhone and I was keen on getting my hands on one but it didn\u2019t make sense,\u201d says Alam, who works for one of the raft of firms to have invested in the southern city of Bengaluru, often called India\u2019s Silicon Valley.  \u201cI look for storage, camera and processor in phones and cheaper alternatives like OnePlus are more value for the money. The new iPhones cost almost 100,000 rupees - I can get three good phones for that price or even a decent gaming laptop.\u201d  Solid Mac sales and the high unit price of iPhones meant Apple\u2019s total revenue of $2 billion in India last year was still double that of OnePlus, which only sells mobile phones. But Counterpoint\u2019s data says that gap will also shrink.  OnePlus\u2019 India head Vikas Agarwal told Reuters this week that 10-15 percent of new customers in recent months have been defectors from Apple, suggesting even some loyalists are opting out of upgrading their handsets.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  HIGH IMPORT DUTIES  Apple\u2019s problems go beyond price.  The company, facing down a handful of regulatory headaches, lost some of its top executives in India at the start of this year.  An Apple spokesman said the departures had nothing to do with the company\u2019s performance, but people familiar with the matter told Reuters that the departures were likely linked to the company changing its distribution system. Apple has cut the number of distributors in the country to two from five.  The sources, who declined to be identified because they have business relationships with Apple, also said company veteran Michel Columb is still working on solidifying business relations since taking control of the Indian operation in December.  Apple declined to comment further.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government has sought to drive electronics producers into manufacturing locally by steadily moving tariffs up the supply chain from simple phone cases to sophisticated chipsets and boards.  Along with local firms like Lava, global smartphone giants including Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Oppo and Xiaomi Corp have responded aggressively, investing millions of dollars in plants around Bengaluru and Delhi tech hub Noida.  Apple is the only major player which does not manufacture phones in the country and it only assembles two low-cost older models through Wistron Corp in Bengaluru.  Industry experts say as a result the company still imports about 70-80 percent of its phones. That results in high import duties, which in turn make the phones expensive.  In the United States, the basic iPhone XR model costs $749 or roughly 54,400 rupees, only two thirds of its retail price in India. Beyond that, while U.S. phones are subsidized under deals with wireless carriers, Apple\u2019s phones in India are not.  \u201cApple doesn\u2019t have enough confidence ... in the Indian manufacturing system right now, to set up plants and move some of the manufacturing out of China,\u201d said analyst Navkendar Singh of tech consulting firm IDC.  \u201cIn the process they are losing around 15-20 percent of their tax incentive ... which they could have passed on to the consumer.\u201d  EMPTY STORES  Diwali, the Festival of Lights, is peak selling time for electronics in India, but the Apple-licensed store in one of Bengaluru\u2019s big shopping malls was deserted this past Saturday.  \u201cFeatures of the emerging phones are very similar to an iPhone,\u201d says salesman Aejaz Ahmed, adding volumes have fallen in the past few months. \u201cIt is very difficult to make out the difference from a distance because they even look so alike.\u201d  Sales staff at several stores in Bengaluru and nearby Chennai pointed to the launch this year of the latest OnePlus phone as a major problem for the U.S. phonemaker. At 37,999 rupees, the Chinese company\u2019s 6T is half the price of the XR.  The result, says Neil Shah, from Counterpoint, is that Apple\u2019s user base in India is set to decline about 10 percent to nine million users this year. That compares to an estimated 436 million Android users.  \u201cIf your user base is declining, you are losing grip on the market,\u201d he says. \u201cThe new customer base is not coming.\u201d","1688":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apple led a rebound in technology shares and boosted all three major U.S. stock indexes on Thursday, while trade worries eased after China welcomed new talks with the United States.

Cook, scheduled to be the keynote speaker at the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, will be one of several executives from U.S. tech companies to present their views at the two-day event.  Facebook FB.O CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google GOOGL.O CEO Sundar Pichai will share their thoughts via video messages.  But Apple, which designs many of its products so that it can\u2019t see users\u2019 data, was expected to send Cook to speak in person. The iPhone maker has largely avoided the data privacy scandals that have affected its rivals Google and Facebook this year. In particular, Cook has publicly criticized Facebook\u2019s business model, arguing it depends on building out detailed profiles of users in order to target advertisements.  Apple views privacy as a \u201cfundamental human right,\u201d Cook is expected to say at the event.  \u201cWe will never achieve technology\u2019s true potential without the full faith and confidence of the people who use it,\u201d he will say.  Other U.S. tech giants such as Amazon AMZN.O, Alphabet Inc, AT&T Inc T.N, Charter Communications Inc CHTR.O and Twitter Inc TWTR.N have said they would back new federal privacy regulations.  Technology companies have been concerned about strict and varying state-level privacy laws in the United States, such as the one signed into law by California Governor Jerry Brown earlier this year that goes into effect in 2020.  Such laws could create a patchwork of differing regulations across the United States that could be difficult to comply with. A uniform federal law could supersede state-level rules.","1698":"FILE PHOTO: A logo of Apple is seen outside at the upcoming Apple Marina Bay Sands store in Singapore, September 8, 2020.

The world\u2019s most valuable technology company also forecast revenue above expectations for the fall, when it typically launches new iPhone models, reassuring a nervous tech sector that saw sell-offs last week in Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc and Netflix Inc on concerns about their future growth.  The Cupertino, California company has responded to a plateauing global smartphone market by launching ever-more expensive phones and diversifying into services, prospering even as rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd missed targets for its flagship Galaxy S9 and China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] took the No. 2 global smartphone sales spot.  Apple also regained growth in China, where sales rose 19 percent. Sales there fell dramatically in 2016 after Chinese consumers shunned the iPhone 7, whose overall appearance differed little from its predecessor.  And a $20 billion stock buyback in the quarter spurred by sweeping U.S. corporate tax cuts brought Apple\u2019s buyback tally this year to a record $43 billion and exceeded the stock market value of almost three-quarters of the companies in the S&P 500.  \u201cThe lesson Apple\u2019s management has learned from the iPhone X, is when you sell a smartphone for more than $1,000 you can sell fewer units and still reap the financial benefits,\u201d said analyst Thomas Forte from D.A. Davidson & Co.  Shares rose 3.7 percent in extended trade to $197.34, a record high, putting its market capitalization at $954 billion. The stock would need to hit $206.49 for Apple to become the first publicly traded U.S. company to cross the $1 trillion threshold, based on Apple\u2019s share count at the end of the quarter. Apple may have reduced its share count since then.  Apple sold 41.3 million iPhones in the fiscal third quarter, half a million less than expected, but the average iPhone selling price topped expectation by $30, hitting $724, according to FactSet. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters that customers were buying costlier models and the $999 iPhone X was the quarter\u2019s best seller.  Apple posted third-quarter revenue of $53.3 billion and profits of $2.34 per share, compared with analyst estimates of $52.3 billion and $2.18 per share, respectively, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/2LNgw6q)  It also forecast revenue of $60 billion to $62 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter, which will include early sales of soon-to-be-announced phone models, beating the $59.6 billion analysts expected, according to data from Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Despite the beat, James Cordwell, an analyst from Atlantic Equities, said the high selling prices might cause investors some concern because \u201cthere\u2019s a limit to how much Apple can grow the iPhone franchise by pushing pricing.\u201d  Apple services include streaming music and video, where Apple faces competition from rivals including Spotify Technology SA and Netflix.  But several of Apple\u2019s services do not face strong rivals. Maestri told Reuters that sales from Apple Care, the company\u2019s warranty offering, were up 27 percent versus a year ago.

Apple is looking at whether it will be hit by tariffs on purchases the company must make, possibly related to data centers, Chief Executive Tim Cook said on a conference call with investors.  He credited \u201cwearables\u201d, a category which includes wireless earphones and the Apple Watch, with making growing contributions, and the Watch could be hit by tariffs. Maestri told Reuters that Apple could not keep up with demand for AirPods headphones.  Services revenue was $9.5 billion, beating analyst expectations of $9.1 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S. The revenue included $236 million from resolving lawsuits such as Apple\u2019s long-running dispute with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.  Apple executives emphasized the recurring nature of much of that revenue, saying the company had reached 300 million subscriptions on its devices, a figure that includes both Apple\u2019s own services such as music and third-party subscriptions such as Netflix, where Apple takes a cut of the revenue when it handles the billing.  Cook said Apple Music has more than 50 million users when free trials are counted and hinted at the company\u2019s video content efforts. Apple has hired prominent television executives from Sony Corp and started making deals for content such as a dramatic series with Hollywood stars Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston.

A warning from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), the world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker and an Apple supplier, on soft demand for smartphones and on the semiconductor industry\u2019s growth this year sparked a tumble in chip stocks.  TSMC\u2019s U.S.-listed shares fell 5.2 percent. Intel declined 2.2 percent and Nvidia sank 1.7 percent.  Each of the stocks on the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index was in the red, with the index down 2.7 percent.  Apple shares also fell 1.8 percent, with at least two analysts blaming the decline on TSMC\u2019s warning. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.  At 9:54 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 92.72 points, or 0.37 percent, at 24,655.35, the S&P 500 was down 13.44 points, or 0.50 percent, at 2,695.20 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 38.37 points, or 0.53 percent, at 7,256.87.  The consumer staples sector declined 2.5 percent. The biggest drag was a 12.5 percent drop in Philip Morris after its revenue missed estimates.  Also weighing was Procter & Gamble, which dropped 3.2 percent after the Dow component said shrinking retailer inventories and higher commodities and transportation costs squeezed its margins.  Still, not everything was gloomy.  American Express was up 3.4 percent after the credit card issuer topped Wall Street profit estimates. That led the financial sector 0.8 higher, making it the only gainer among the 11 major S&P sectors.  Amazon gained 2.1 percent after the e-commerce retailer said it now has more than 100 million Amazon Prime members globally.  \u201cWe are in a digestion period where we are inundated with massive amounts of information. On balance, things look great, the (profit) growth rate is at mid 20 percent on S&P,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in Boston.  Of the 52 companies among the S&P 500 that have reported first-quarter earnings through Wednesday, 78.8 percent topped profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Overall profits at S&P 500 companies are expected to have increased 19.4 percent in the first quarter, the biggest in seven years.

The euro rose on better-than-expected German economic data and gold prices fell as positive signals on the U.S.-China trade front bolstered risk sentiment and offset support for the metal from a weaker dollar.  Top U.S. and Chinese trade officials reaffirmed their commitment to a trade deal that had appeared on shaky ground because of worsening bilateral ties.  A 1.7% slide in Apple Inc., whose market capitalization of $2.15 trillion is greater than all the components in the benchmark FTSE 100 index in London, helped snap a three-day rally on Wall Street.  A survey from the Conference Board showed U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly fell in August to hit a six-year low.  Stocks in Europe retreated to trade little changed, the same as stocks on Wall Street after the S&P 500 set a new intra-day high before turning south.  Europe\u2019s broad FTSEurofirst 300 index dropped 0.32% to 1,434.94, while MSCI\u2019s benchmark for global equity markets rose 0.02% to 577.34.  Wall Street was mixed, as the Nasdaq edged slightly higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.62%, the S&P 500 lost 0.07% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.13%.  The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq logged new closing highs on Monday, boosted by signs of progress in developing treatments and vaccines for COVID-19.  German business morale improved more than expected in August as both manufacturing and services picked up steam, a survey by the Ifo institute showed. The survey raised hopes for a strong recovering from the coronavirus in Europe\u2019s largest economy.  The dollar index fell 0.128%, with the euro up 0.2% to $1.1811.  Investors are waiting to hear Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s speech on Thursday about the U.S. central bank\u2019s policy framework review during the Jackson Hole symposium.  A major focus for investors will be whether Powell signals that the Fed will shift its inflation target to an average. This would allow inflation to rise more quickly than in the past.  Longer-term U.S. Treasury yields rose as traders moved into riskier asset classes on reassurance that a U.S.-China trade deal would continue. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 6.4 basis points to 0.7096%.  Euro zone government bond yields rose on the Ifo survey. Germany\u2019s 10-year bond yields, a benchmark for the region, rose 5 basis points to a one-week high of -0.445%.

Luxury stocks, heavily exposed to the Chinese markets, also rose.  Apple CEO Tim Cook said trade tensions between the United States and China were easing, lifting the mood before another round of official talks on Wednesday in Washington.  The two sides will meet next door to the White House in the highest-level talks since U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed a 90-day truce in their trade war in December.  \u201cI expect that the Washington summit will help pave the way for an extension of the trade truce. This is also what markets expect and a failure of the talks is not priced in at all,\u201d said Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager at Anthilia Capital.  FED FOCUS  Expectations from Wednesday\u2019s Federal Reserve rates review are that policymakers will reinforce their recent dovish stance, given signs of a slowdown in the U.S. economy.  \u201cWe believe the Fed is likely to show the flexibility markets are seeking at its upcoming meeting, as it balances still solid domestic economic growth against slower global growth and less significant, but persistent, domestic risks,\u201d said John Lynch, Chief Investment Strategist at LPL Financial.

Investors are looking for hints from Chairman Jerome Powell on whether he has any inclination to slow the drawdown of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet by up to $50 billion a month.  The dollar index - a gauge of its value versus six major peers - was flat at 95.797.  The Australian dollar surged 0.5 percent as inflation topped forecasts, while the Chinese yuan reached a six-month high in the offshore market before the trade talks.  In commodities, gold rose 0.2 percent to 8-1\/2-month highs of $1,315.3 per ounce, supported by uncertainty over U.S.-China trade relations and expectations the Fed will keep policy on hold.  Oil prices inched up, supported by concerns about supply disruptions following U.S. sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s oil industry but pegged back by a darkening outlook for the global economy.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures added 0.19 percent at $53.41 per barrel, while Brent crude oil futures added 0.10 percent at $61.38 per barrel.

Apple surprised Wall Street as it was able to get loyal shoppers to buy iPhones, iPads and Macs online even as several brick-and-mortar stores remained closed due to the coronavirus lockdowns.  Started in the garage of co-founder Steve Jobs in 1976, Apple has pushed its revenue beyond the economic outputs of Portugal, Peru and other countries.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  The rare collaboration between the two Silicon Valley companies, whose operating systems power 99% of the world\u2019s smartphones, could accelerate usage of apps that aim to get potentially infected individuals into testing or quarantine more quickly and reliably than existing systems in much of the world. Such tracing will play a vital role in managing the virus once lockdown orders end, health experts say.  The planned technology also throws the weight of the tech leaders into a global conflict between privacy advocates who favor a decentralized system to trace contacts and governments in Europe and Asia pushing centralized approaches that have technical weaknesses and potentially let governments know with whom people associate.  \u201cWith Apple and Google, you get all the public health functions you need with a decentralized and privacy-friendly app,\u201d said Michael Veale, University College London legal lecturer involved in European contact tracing system DP3T. Centralized solutions such as those proposed in Britain and Germany would no longer work under the new technology, he said.  To be effective, the Silicon Valley system would require millions of people to opt in the system, trusting the technology companies\u2019 safeguards, as well as smooth oversight by public health systems.  The companies said they started developing the technology two weeks ago to streamline technical differences between Apple\u2019s iPhones and Google\u2019s Android that had stymied the interoperation of some existing contact tracing apps.  Under the plan, users\u2019 phones with the technology will emit unique Bluetooth signals. Phones within about six feet can record anonymous information about encounters.  People who test positive for the virus can opt to send an encrypted list of phones they came near to Apple and Google, which will trigger alerts to potentially exposed users to seek more information. Public health authorities would need to sign off that an individual has tested positive before they can send on the data.  The logs will be scrambled to keep infected individuals\u2019 data anonymous, even to Apple, Google and contact tracing app makers, the companies said. Apple and Google said their contact tracing system will not track GPS location.  \u201cTo their credit, Apple and Google have announced an approach that appears to mitigate the worst privacy and centralization risks,\u201d Jennifer Granick, surveillance and cybersecurity counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said.  She added that the companies could have more safeguards such as specifying that contract tracing features would not be used beyond the current pandemic.  NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR TESTING  Apple and Google plan to release software tools in mid-May to contact tracing apps that they and public health authorities approve. Apps including Private Kit and CoEpi, which had contacted Apple and Google for help a month ago, said the new tools would enable them to drop potentially unreliable workarounds.  Apps will be able to focus on developing a simple interface for users and healthcare workers, with Apple and Google handling Bluetooth and privacy issues, said Dana Lewis, a lead developer of contact tracing app CoEpi.  However, Apple and Google plan to release software updates in the coming months so that users do not need a separate app to log nearby phones.  Google said the tools and updates would not be available where its services are blocked, such as in China or on unofficial Android devices. Apple will distribute the technology as an update to its iPhone operating system.  A median of 76% of people in United States and other advanced economies have smartphones, according to a Pew Research Center study last year, compared with a median of 45% in emerging economies.  Governments worldwide have been scrambling to adopt software meant to improve the normally labor-intensive process of contact tracing, in which health officials go to recent contacts of an infected person and ask them to self-quarantine or get tested.  \u201cIt\u2019s very interesting, but a lot of people worry about it in terms of a person\u2019s freedom. We\u2019re going to take a look at that, a very strong look at that,\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump said at a press briefing when asked about Apple and Google\u2019s efforts.  Health experts have credited extensive testing and contact tracing with slowing the spread of the virus in nations such as South Korea, but limited testing has held back contact tracing in the United States.  For instance, New York City\u2019s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene told Reuters on Friday that tracing will not be helpful until the virus is controlled, with apps potentially proving expedient when someone has crossed paths with many people.  \u201cThis isn\u2019t a substitute for testing - you need to know who has it - but it produces actionable results so people can act responsibly, self-isolate and reduce anxiety in the community as a whole,\u201d said Al Gidari, a Stanford University law school lecturer and previously long-time external counsel to Google.","1707":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in an Eikon news window.)  * Announcement on China tariffs expected from Washington  * New tariffs expected to hit tech, consumer products  * Apple drags on tech, Amazon pulls consumer discretionary down  * FAANG stocks slide, retailers lead consumer stocks lower  * Indexes down: Dow 0.35 pct, S&P 0.56 pct, Nasdaq 1.43 pct (Updates to market close)  NEW YORK, Sept 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Monday, led by declines in technology and consumer discretionary stocks as investors looked to President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement regarding tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports.  All three major U.S. indexes were lower, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq posting its biggest percentage loss since late July.

But with the coronavirus pandemic spreading across the world, the urgent question for the company is how many buyers there will be both for current models and the new slate of phones expected in the fall.  FILE PHOTO: People wearing protective masks wait for checking their temperature in an Apple Store, in Shanghai, China, as the country is hit by an outbreak of the novel coronavirus, February 21, 2020. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  A senior official at one of Apple\u2019s major contract assemblers said Apple\u2019s orders for the quarter ending in March are likely to drop 18% compared with the previous year. The production ramp-up for new phones that work with next-generation 5G networks has been postponed, this person said, though it is still possible the 5G phones could launch as scheduled in the fall.  \u201cNo one is talking about manpower or material shortage (in China) anymore. Now everyone is looking at whether demand from U.S. and Europe could keep up,\u201d said the person, who has direct knowledge of the matter. \u201cThe focus now is the demand from consumers in the U.S. and Europe.\u201d  One of Apple\u2019s key display suppliers is preparing for a similar level of contraction, according to a person familiar the matter. The company had anticipated shipping 70 million iPhone displays this year, but is now considering lowering that target by more than 17% to 58 million units.  The company is also planning to reduce the workforce at its Apple-designated production lines in its Vietnam factory, where displays are assembled before heading to China to be put into phones, this person said.  Apple declined to comment for this story.  Earlier this month, the company closed retail stores around the world even as it began to reopen outlets in China. With much of Europe and the United States on lockdown and unemployment soaring globally, there is little clarity on when demand might return.  The company could also yet face further supply chain problems as countries including Malaysia and Vietnam impose new restrictions to combat the coronavirus.  \u201cThings are changing on a day by day basis due to supply chain disruptions, so it is difficult to craft any meaningful comment at the moment about both supply and demand,\u201d said an official at one supplier in Malaysia.  FOGGY DEMAND OUTLOOK  In February, Apple retracted its sales forecast for the quarter ended in March without giving a new one. Shares have dropped more than 15% since the start of the year.  \u201cOur base case scenario assumes a shock to June quarter demand with steadily improving results\u201d in the second half of the year rather than a \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery, Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley wrote in a note to investors on March 18.  Taipei-based technology analyst Arthur Liao of Fubon Research cut iPhone shipment forecasts for this year\u2019s first quarter to 35 million units, down 17% from 41 million units a year ago. The firm lowered total iPhone shipment forecasts for 2020 to 198 million, down from an earlier forecast of 204 million.  In the United States, at least, consumers themselves seem uncertain whether they will resume spending. In a survey of more than 2,600 U.S. adults by Civis Analytics conducted March 18-20, more than half of respondents said they planned to spend about the same on consumer electronics as before the virus outbreak if the situation is contained in the coming weeks.  But if the situation worsens, the respondents were evenly split, with roughly one-third each saying they would spend less, the same or more on consumer electronics when conditions returned to normal.  Such ambiguity has made it hard for Apple suppliers to gauge how 2020 will play out.  One maker of a sensor for the iPhone said the company continues to produce and ship parts for Apple devices and that this year\u2019s first quarter ending in March was better than last year, with the second quarter also likely be higher volume than the year before.  \u201cWe were given a forecast for this quarter before the pandemic, about a month ago,\u201d a person familiar with the situation at the sensor supplier said last week. \u201cAnd now we are still producing as per the forecast given to us.\u201d  (Corrects paragraph 10 to show that Apple retracted its guidance in February, not January)","1711":"Jan 8 (Reuters) - Apple Inc has threatened to remove the Parler social networking service from its App Store unless the company changes its content moderation policies, Parler Chief Executive John Matze told Reuters on Friday.

The details on holdings in the Fed\u2019s Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, one of nearly a dozen emergency programs the Fed has rolled out since March to respond to the coronavirus crisis, were published Friday.  The Fed's largest investment-grade fund holding - iShares iBoxx US Dollar Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF LQD.P - contains 30 Apple bonds giving the Fed about $5.7 million of exposure to the maker of iPhones through that ETF alone as of May 19. Apple is also a holding in other ETFs the Fed bought.  The largest of the facility's junk bond fund holdings - iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF HYG.P - gives the Fed around $25,000 of exposure to three companies that have filed for bankruptcy since the health crisis erupted, including $14,000 to car rental company Hertz, $10,000 to retailer JC Penney, and $1,500 to department store operator Neiman Marcus.  All told the Fed made 158 purchases of shares in 15 exchange-traded funds from May 12 and May 18, the data showed.  Until the health crisis, the Fed had bought U.S. Treasuries and government-backed bonds. The SMCCF\u2019s purchases of bond ETFs represent entirely new territory.

Dialog semiconductor logo is pictured at a company building in Germering near Munich, Germany August 15, 2016. REUTERS\/Michaela Rehle  The Anglo-German chip designer struck the deal in October with Apple, which accounts for three-quarters of its revenue, helping it to weather an iPhone sales downturn better than other suppliers to the smartphone maker.  Dialog said the business that will remain after it transfers a team of programmers and patents to Apple should show strong growth in 2019, weighted towards the second half.  This upbeat outlook helped to lift Dialog\u2019s shares, which were up more than 5 percent by 1400 GMT, providing a rare boost for the semiconductor industry, which has been through a rough patch.  Dialog joins a small but growing number of chipmakers forecasting stronger demand later in the year, in a sector hit by the U.S.-China trade dispute and weakness in the car and smartphone industries.  Nvidia and AMD have both given optimistic 2019 outlooks in the past few weeks.  CONNECTED HEALTH  Dialog is working with four pharmaceuticals firms to develop connected health applications, as well as with two gaming companies to provide power chips for their next gaming consoles, Bagherli said.  The connected health devices would monitor blood pressure, check glucose levels or administer insulin doses for diabetic patients without them having to visit a hospital, he said in an interview.  These are part of the so-called Internet of Things - or smart devices and sensors that can be managed remotely and are expected to proliferate as fifth-generation mobile networks are launched in the years ahead.  The Apple deal, expected to close in the first half of the year, will hand Dialog a cash windfall to back its transition to a smaller, more diversified business.  \u201cWe find this transformation of Dialog\u2019s business compelling, and think its current valuation overly discounts the risk associated with the company\u2019s evolving business model,\u201d Barclays analyst Andrew Gardiner said in a note.  Gardiner holds an \u201coverweight\/neutral\u201d rating on the stock.  Dialog earlier forecast a single-digit percentage decline in revenue this year, reflecting weaker iPhone sales. This forecast topped a consensus view among analysts for a 9 percent fall.  Apple had shocked the sector in November by warning of slow year-end sales and did so again on Jan. 3 when it issued its first sales warning in 12 years, blaming weaker iPhone sales in China.  Those warnings hit shares in other European suppliers, like Austria\u2019s AMS, while weak automotive markets have also weighed on larger players like Infineon and STMicroelectronics.  Some industry players have forecast a quick, V-shaped rebound in demand although persistent weakness in measures of industrial activity such as purchasing managers indexes and inventory builds suggest a recovery may be slow.  Dialog expects first-quarter revenue of $270-$310 million, representing a more pronounced than usual seasonal slowdown, with gross margins broadly in line with the 2018 figure.  NEW PRODUCTS  Dialog is also looking to boost sales of mixed-signal integrated circuits, which can be configured by users. This business, which Dialog entered with the takeover of U.S. company Silego, is growing well, Bagherli said.  The company is seeking opportunities for its power-management chips from folding smartphones unveiled at last week\u2019s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. These will carry two or three battery cells that need managing, he said.  Asked about how Dialog would use the cash windfall from the Apple deal, Bagherli said he would spend some on acquisitions.  He is looking at targets in Internet of Things connectivity - in narrowband radio and WiFi - to back up Dialog\u2019s existing strengths in Bluetooth. A follow-on deal to bolster Silego\u2019s franchise would also make sense, he added.  Dialog reported a 2 percent rise in fourth-quarter operating profits. Revenues were down 7 percent.  Based on its divisional performance, mobile sales fell 13 percent in the fourth quarter, mainly due to a decline in sales of main PMICs to Apple.  Taken together, other divisions showed a 20 percent rise in sales, although this was buoyed by the contribution from the Silego takeover in late 2017.","1716":"FILE PHOTO: Apple logo is seen on a Macbook in this illustration taken taken April 12, 2020.

No debut date for the untitled series was announced. Apple said in a statement that each one-hour episode would address a single issue and explore topics related to current events and Stewart\u2019s advocacy work.  The issues also will be discussed in a companion podcast, the company said.  Stewart\u2019s irreverent brand of political and media satire made him a beloved figure on television with influence far beyond the 2 to 3 million nightly audience of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d on Comedy Central.

STORY:  COMMENTS:  PAUL NOLTE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT, CHICAGO, WHO OWNS APPLE:  \u201cDo we all get hats for this? To be honest, I don\u2019t know if it has any big implications. Apple is so different than the other tech stocks in the FAANG group... So I don\u2019t know if there are any implications for the FAANG group or technology in general because you had a really very uneven earnings season, with some issues unique to each of those companies, so it\u2019s hard to generalize.  \u201cI would expect to see the dividend increase, announced at their annual meeting. For those that hold Apple, it\u2019s reasonably priced here. We\u2019ve owned it for three or four years now, and it\u2019s probably our second- or third-largest holding. I have trimmed it over the last 12 months just because it was large compared to the rest of the portfolio, so I may do that again if it continues to rise. If it goes up to say $250, I\u2019d trim it a little bit.  \u201cMy concern generally speaking is the FAANG stocks are just incredibly large relative to the rest of the market, and with a lot of passive money going into the S&P 500, ultimately a lot of money goes into those FAANG stocks by default. So it\u2019s a self -perpetuating machine.\u201d  \u201cAmazon is the next closest and given the step backwards that Netflix and Facebook and, to a lesser extent, (Alphabet) took, Amazon has a reasonable shot at getting there.\u201d  KIM FORREST, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP IN PITTSBURGH:  \u201cIt\u2019s something for people to talk about, a number, a threshold to reach. It was inevitable ... this means that Apple did a really good job this quarter.\u201d  \u201cThe more telling thing is if people should be buying it today if they don\u2019t have a position. I don\u2019t know about that. The more practical approach is just because something hits some sort of milestone it doesn\u2019t mean it needs to be purchased today. Enjoy watching it ... Price is always important and why would you be one of the people buying it on a high.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s a good sign for the market and the economy. Because even though today we\u2019re talking about the impact of trade or currency war, an issue with China, Apple who makes most of their products in China is hitting this.\u201d  \u201cIf we can look beyond what\u2019s happening today politically and a group of investors says \u2018I\u2019m buying into Apple,\u2019 that\u2019s a hugely positive sign.\u201d  \u201cThere\u2019s enough momentum in the technology sector because we saw that turn around in the past few days that it didn\u2019t feel like a dead cat bounce. We are in the thick of summer where there are fewer investors paying attention to the market and trading but it doesn\u2019t feel like those weird trading days before a holiday where ... lack of volume is really apparent.\u201d  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t particularly mean a whole lot to a professional investor, like crossing the whole numbers on the Dow. It just doesn\u2019t.\u201d  BRAD NEUMAN, DIRECTOR OF MARKET STRATEGY AT ALGER, A GROWTH EQUITY ASSET MANAGEMENT FIRM IN NEW YORK CITY:  \u201cIt speaks to the power of the company\u2019s platform. We think of Apple as less of a device maker and more of a platform for services, and I think the markets are starting to recognize the value of its platform and services more and more and that\u2019s what is being reflected in the increase in market capitalization.\u201d  PETER TUZ, PRESIDENT OF CHASE INVESTMENT COUNSEL IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA:  \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a tremendous achievement to create a company with a $1 trillion market cap.  \u201cSteve Jobs and his co-founders... created a company that has lasted a long time and continues to capture the imagination of consumers all around the world with their new products and services.  \u201cIt is still, compared to many other companies, not an expensive stock.  \u201cThey still have a long runway with new products and especially getting more people addicted to the various services that they have rolled out.  \u201cI am thinking Amazon is going to get there in the not-too-distant future as well.  \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous achievement.

The central bank made no move on interest rates as policymakers took heart in continued U.S. job gains and economic growth and held out hope that weak inflation will edge higher.  President Donald Trump recently called for the Fed to cut interest rates and renew its quantitative easing program.  \u201cNo surprises from the Fed, this is exactly what people thought,\u201d said Stephen Massocca, Senior Vice President at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.  \u201cWith 3% GDP growth, you saw the ADP number today, we are heating up.

The iPhone maker beat depressed expectations despite a record drop in phone revenue, gave an upbeat assessment of its China business, said it would buy back $75 billion in shares and hiked its dividend. The gains pushed Apple closer to $1-trillion market capitalization yet again.  Sentiment also received a boost from early data on the labor market, as a report by payrolls processor ADP showed U.S. private employers added 275,000 jobs in April, well above the 180,000 estimate.  Still, reports on construction spending and U.S. manufacturing came in weaker than expected, sending conflicting signals about the strength of the economy.  S&P 500 earnings are now expected to show growth of 0.5% for the quarter, according to Refinitiv data. At the start of April, earnings were expected to decline by 2%, sparking some concerns about the possible start of an earnings recession.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 68.43 points, or 0.26%, to 26,661.34, the S&P 500 gained 7.34 points, or 0.25%, to 2,953.17 and the Nasdaq Composite added 48.78 points, or 0.6%, to 8,144.17.

REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  Smartphone companies are hoping for a strong recovery in demand in China, where the deadly coronavirus is subsiding, just as it spreads overseas and looks set to trigger a global recession.  Mobile phone shipments in China in March totalled 21 million units, according to data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), a government think tank.  That was a more than three-fold increase from February, yet still down roughly 20% compared with March 2019.  Chinese retailers largely resumed operations by early March, with brick-and-mortar outlets re-opening and e-commerce logistics getting back in gear after the virus and tough containment measures brought much of the economy to a standstill in the first two months.  Apple shipped roughly 500,000 phones in China in February, according to the CAICT.  Many smartphone makers are now hoping that sales in China can cushion declines in overseas markets in coming months.  In its quarterly earnings call, the then-CFO of Xiaomi Corp 1810.HK said that the Chinese market had recovered to roughly 80% of its normal levels.  The company later wrote a letter to the government of India, one of its largest markets, requesting that it consider smartphones an essential commodity and therefore exempt from shipping restrictions.  Earlier this month several Chinese online retailers slashed prices on iPhone 11 models. Apple has let third-party sellers in China offer discounts in the past in order to spur demand.

Apple's iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 are seen in an illustration released in Cupertino, California, U.S. October 13, 2020. Apple Inc.\/Handout via REUTERS  The much-anticipated Apple launch comes in the wake of Chinese Android-platform brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi Corp having already rolled out higher-end 5G devices compatible with China\u2019s upgraded telecoms networks, with the U.S. giant seen by some analysts to be late to the party.  In its second-largest market by revenue, Apple\u2019s announcement was feverishly discussed on social media. With over 6 billion views, the tag \u2018iPhone12\u2019 ranked as the no. 1 topic on China\u2019s Twitter-like Weibo.  Asked if they\u2019d buy the new iPhone, which will give Apple users 5G access in a market where such networks are already widespread, respondents to a Caijing magazine poll were almost evenly split: some 10,000 voted no, 9,269 said yes, and just over 5,400 said they were still considering it.  Available for orders in China from Oct. 16, the iPhone 12 will cost 5,499 yuan ($815.37) for a \u2018mini\u2019 version, rising to as much as 11,899 yuan for the top of the range.  That price tag was also a hot topic, with many complaining it was too expensive. \u201cHow is it this expensive even with no power charger or earbuds?,\u201d said one commenter, referring to Apple\u2019s announcement that it would leave out those components citing environmental reasons.  Many Weibo users said they may put off ordering iPhone 12s to wait for the expected unveiling of Huawei\u2019s rival Mate 40 Pro this month.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Still, analysts said they were bullish about the iPhone 12\u2019s reception in China, saying that the firm still likely had many loyal users who have postponed upgrading devices until the launch of the 5G-friendly iPhone 12.  With the new model in view, research firm Canalys recently revised its forecast for iPhone shipments to China in fourth-quarter 2020 to a 14% year-on-year increase, a big swing from the 1% decrease it originally predicted.  \u201cIn China now, 5G is not a premium feature, it\u2019s a must-have feature,\u201d said Nicole Peng, who tracks China\u2019s smartphone sector at Canalys. Peng said the 5G launch will \u201ctrigger a new wave of phone replacements\u201d for Apple in China before the end of the year and in first-quarter 2021.  Canalys expects 50% of Chinese phone owners to be using a 5G device by the end of 2020, as networks and phone brands have aggressively pushed adoption. Only 29% of U.S. phone owners will be on 5G devices by the same time.  Apple could also stand to benefit from a potential unravelling of its main high-end rival Huawei, which could see its smartphone division collapse next year due to U.S. restrictions on its supply of chips.  Neil Shah, analyst at Counterpoint Research, said he expects Apple stands to benefit \u201csignificantly\u201d from the potential gap which will be left due to the U.S. trade restrictions on Huawei to produce new phones at scale.  On the flipside, there is lingering concern that Apple could be vulnerable to growing geopolitical tensions between the United States and China.  Beijing is expected to unveil an \u2018entity list\u2019 that bars domestic companies from doing business with certain foreign companies amid industry speculation that Apple and other high-profile tech firms could be targeted.  Throughout the past year though, consumer sentiment has yet to turn negative on Apple, even as Huawei\u2019s troubles have made headlines in China.  Apple\u2019s unit shipments in China increased 35% year-on-year in China in the second quarter of 2020, according to Canalys. That made it the only top brand besides Huawei to see positive growth - a feat it achieved even without offering a 5G device.","1727":"(Reuters) - Lumentum Holdings Inc said on Tuesday it expects Android smartphone makers to launch devices with facial recognition technology this year even as the Apple Inc supplier forecast slightly lower-than-expected revenue for its current quarter.  Securing new contracts for its 3D sensing face recognition technology from Android phone makers could help Lumentum reduce its heavy dependence on Apple, which has warned of slowing smartphone sales in China.  Samsung\u2019s upcoming Galaxy S10 5G phones are expected to adopt 3D sensing technology, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang said in a note.  Shares of the California-based company fell 4 percent in early trading on Tuesday, joining two other Apple suppliers - Austria-based AMS and Munich-based Infineon - that forecast gloomy sales.  \u201cAndroid is strong but still small versus Apple, but orders and design wins are strong in Android for both front facing and world facing,\u201d Alex Henderson, analyst at Needham and Co, said.  Lumentum, which gets more than 80 percent of its revenue from optical communication products, forayed into the smartphone market with vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) that power the Face ID, Animoji and portrait mode features on Apple\u2019s latest iPhones.  Last year, it acquired Oclaro to strengthen its position against rival Finisar Corp, which also supplies 3D sensing lasers to Apple.  \u201cDuring calendar 2019, based on customer engagements we have today, we expect new and existing customers will announce and release additional new 3D sensing-enabled products,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Alan Lowe said on a post-earnings call.  \u201cSeveral of these opportunities are expected to bring new functionality that could expand our content per device, including world facing capabilities,\u201d Lowe said.  Lumentum also said it expects third-quarter revenue to be in the range of $420 million to $440 million.  Analysts, on average, had expected revenue of $440.9 million for the quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Net income attributable to common shareholders plunged to $5.4 million, or 8 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $196.9 million, or $3.05 per share, a year earlier.  On an adjusted basis, the company earned an earnings per share of $1.15 in the quarter ended Dec. 29, missing analysts\u2019 average estimate of $1.17.  Total revenue fell 7.6 percent to $373.7 million in the quarter, still beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $359.6 million.

The world\u2019s largest contract manufacturer, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said in a stock exchange filing that changes in employee numbers were part of its usual adjustments based on global strategy and clients\u2019 needs.  \u201cThe group still has recruiting needs of more than 50,000 in parts of the factories in China in the first quarter of 2019,\u201d Foxconn said in Chinese.  Last week, the Nikkei reported that Foxconn had let go around 50,000 contract workers in China since October, months earlier than normal.  The Nikkei report came weeks after Apple cut current-quarter production for new iPhones by 10 percent in the face of slowing demand in China, the world\u2019s largest smartphone market.  Chipmaker Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and other tech suppliers have also warned of a tech slowdown going into 2019.

Export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, in October jumped 9.1% from a year earlier to $51.6 billion, Ministry of Economic Affairs data showed on Friday. The data exceeded an 8.2% rise projected in a Reuters poll.  The ministry said orders were helped by new smartphone launches ahead of the year-end holiday season, as well as continued robust demand for telecommuting products as many people are forced to work and study from home globally during the pandemic. Orders for electronics rose 17.5% on year, mostly due to new smartphones and gaming consoles coming to market and work-from-home demand, the ministry added.  Taiwanese firms such as Foxconn 2354.TW and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) 2330.TWTSM.N are key suppliers to Apple, which last month launched its next-generation iPhone 12, with faster 5G connectivity. Taiwan usually sees strong electronics orders in the third and fourth quarters ahead of the year-end holiday season when vendors launch new smartphone models.  The ministry expects export orders to rise between 14.5% and 17.9% in November, fuelled by new consumer electronics products from major global brands coming to market, though it warned of uncertainly about rising number of COVID-19 cases globally and lingering concerns over the U.S.-China tensions. U.S. orders in October rose 17.1% from a year earlier, compared with 11.1% growth in September, while those from China went up 10.7% versus a 31% gain the previous month.  European orders fell 0.1%, while those from Japan soared 18.6%. Taiwan\u2019s economy grew at its fastest pace in more than two years in the third quarter after a steep contraction earlier this year, as strong global demand for its tech exports and returning consumer confidence eased the hit from the pandemic.","1730":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge said on Wednesday he was uncertain if he had a legal basis to bar the U.S. Commerce Department from imposing restrictions on video-sharing app TikTok after a Pennsylvania judge had already blocked the government\u2019s plan on Friday.

REUTERS\/Kim Hong-Ji\/File Photo  The Apple supplier posted an operating profit of 685 billion won ($622 million) in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with a loss of 422 billion won in the same period a year earlier.  It was the display panel firm\u2019s highest quarterly profit since the second quarter of 2017, and soundly ahead of market expectations for a 286 billion won profit, according to a Refinitiv SmartEstimate derived from 12 analyst estimates.  \u201cAs the global work-from-home situation continued in the fourth quarter, demand for TV and IT products remained strong,\u201d LG Display said in a statement.  Shipments and prices of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels rose for both TVs and smartphones, while the strong earnings were helped by full-scale production at its Guangzhou OLED plant, the company said.  Analysts highlighted increased shipments of OLED panels for Apple Inc\u2019s new iPhone 12 and higher prices for liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels. LCD prices rose on the back of growing demand for TVs from global consumers stuck at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Apple\u2019s iPhone shipments in the fourth quarter were likely up 21% on-year due to the strong performance of the iPhone 12, according to Counterpoint data.  Stronger iPhone sales should spill over into LG Display\u2019s first quarter result, analysts said.  \u201cThe first half of the year is usually a seasonal down-cycle, but this year is different. It will continue to swing to profit, as iPhone 12 sales are expected to increase panel shipments by 1.5 to two times the amount a year earlier,\u201d said Kim Kwang-jin, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Korea.  LCD panel prices should also remain high in the first quarter, he said.  LG Display, which had previously said it planed to halt domestic production of LCD TV panels by 2020, said in an earnings call on Wednesday that it will be flexible on domestic production based on market conditions this year.  A power outage in Nippon Electric Glass\u2019 (NEG) Japan-based glass manufacturing facility in December may affect LG Display\u2019s first-quarter shipments, as about 80% of its glass came from NEG in the first half of 2020, analysts said.  But the lower supply of large-sized glass could further lift panel prices in the first quarter, offsetting the impact of any fall in shipments, they added.

The Federal Reserve\u2019s commitment to tolerate inflation and keep interest rates low, positive developments in vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 and a rally in tech-focused stocks have helped the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit consecutive all-time highs.

While the splits did not provide a fundamental reason for greater interest in the stocks, Mahajan noted that Apple\u2019s new stock price closer to $130 than $500 is likely making the stock more accessible to retail investors.  At 2:46 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 180.25 points, or 0.63%, at 28,473.62, the S&P 500 was up 2.22 points, or 0.06%, at 3,510.23 and the Nasdaq Composite added 121.01 points, or 1.03%, to 11,816.64.  The S&P was on track for a 7.2% gain for the month, its biggest gain for August since 1984 when it gained 10.6% for that month.  More than half of the S&P\u2019s 505 constituents are still in the red year-to-date.  \u201cIt\u2019s back to Nasdaq leadership and profit taking in other parts of the market,\u201d said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab.  \u201cI worry that sentiment has gotten frothy and there\u2019s a lot of money in the market that doesn\u2019t see any downside risk.\u201d  Technology and consumer discretionary stocks outperformed among the major S&P sectors.  The three main indexes are also set for their fifth straight monthly rise following March lows, even as economic data pointed to an uneven recovery from the steep downturn.

Ousted companies Exxon Mobil Corp, Pfizer Inc and Raytheon Technologies Corp also fell.  Aimmune Therapeutics Inc\u2019s shares were up 171% after Swiss food group Nestle SA offered to pay $2 billion for full ownership of the peanut allergy treatment maker.  Shares of Microsoft Corp, Walmart Inc and Oracle Corp - all suitors for TikTok\u2019s U.S. assets - fell as China\u2019s new rules around tech exports meant a deal with ByteDance could need Beijing\u2019s approval.  Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.87-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, a 1.33-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Apple was hit with an additional 5 million euro fine for failing to give clients clear information about how to maintain or eventually replace handset batteries.  Italian consumer groups had complained that software updates for mobile phones reduced the functionality of the devices and were designed to push clients into buying new handsets.  The anti-trust body said in a statement that some Apple and Samsung firmware updates \u201chad caused serious dysfunctions and reduced performance significantly, thereby accelerating the process of replacing them\u201d.  It added the two firms had not provided clients adequate information about the impact of the new software \u201cor any means of restoring the original functionality of the products\u201d.  Apple acknowledged last year that iPhone software had the effect of slowing down some phones with battery problems, but denied it had ever done anything to intentionally shorten the life of a product.  The firm apologized for its actions and cut battery replacement costs. It has also said it would change its software to show users whether their phone batteries were working well.  Samsung\u2019s software updates for its phones have not previously been questioned. But the Italian regulator said it acted on complaints about the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 released in September 2014.  It found in a months-long review of customer service records and internal emails from Samsung that an Android operating system update released in 2016 was not optimized for the Galaxy Note 4. The update produced serious malfunctions, including unwanted automatic restarts, because it put too much stress on ageing Note 4 devices, the regulator concluded.

The trade body said the decision to open an investigation did not constitute any decision on the merits of the case.  Neodron\u2019s complaint alleges that the companies violated Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 by infringing on the company\u2019s patents, and asked the ITC to issue a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders.

The European Commission said its investigation would look into Apple\u2019s requirement forcing app developers to sell to customers using its own in-app purchase system and rules preventing them from informing users of cheaper products elsewhere.  The investigation will also cover all apps which compete with Apple in Europe, which could be icloud and gaming apps, following informal information received by regulators.  The probe followed Swedish music streaming service Spotify's SPOT.N complaint last year, which said Apple was unfairly restricting rivals to its own music steaming service Apple Music. Another gripe was the 30% fee levied on app developers.  Spotify welcomed the EU move. A smaller rival filed a similar grievance related to e-books and audiobooks in March this year.  \u201cIt appears that Apple obtained a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 role when it comes to the distribution of apps and content to users of Apple\u2019s popular devices,\u201d European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.  The second case focuses on Apple\u2019s terms and conditions on how its mobile payment service Apple Pay should be used in merchants\u2019 apps and websites, and also the company\u2019s refusal to allow rivals access to the payment system.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Apple and Qualcomm are locked in a wide-ranging legal dispute in which Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices. Qualcomm has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement.  Qualcomm initiated the ITC case against Apple in July 2017, alleging that iPhones containing Intel INTC.O chips infringed six patents describing technology that helps smartphones perform well without draining the battery.  Qualcomm did not allege that Intel chips violate its patents, but that the way Apple implemented them in the iPhone does. It later dropped three of the six patents from the case.  Administrative law judge Thomas Pender, a now-retired member of the ITC tribunal that hears patent infringement cases, ruled in September that Apple infringed one of the patents, but cleared the company of infringing the other two.  Pender recommended the agency not grant Qualcomm the relief the San Diego, California-based chipmaker had sought, saying it was not in the U.S. interest.  The ITC said on Wednesday it would review whether the one patent was indeed infringed and also whether it was right to not grant Qualcomm relief. Pender\u2019s decision on the other two patents would not be reviewed, it said.  The agency would also consider how long it would take Apple to design around Qualcomm\u2019s patented battery-saving technology, what national security concerns would be implicated by an sales ban and whether a limited import ban could be adopted, it said.  \u201cWe are pleased that the Commission is going to review the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s recommendation that no ITC remedy should result from a finding of infringement,\u201d Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm\u2019s executive vice president and general counsel, said in a statement after the announcement.

TSMC is the world\u2019s biggest contract chipmaker and manufactures semiconductors for Apple Inc, Qualcomm Inc and a range of other technology companies. The company in May disclosed its intentions to build a 5-nanometer chip factory in Arizona, which would be its first advanced manufacturing facility in the United States. Earlier this month it approved an investment to set up a wholly owned subsidiary in the U.S. state with paid-in capital of $3.5 billion.  The Phoenix City Council voted to allow the city to enter the agreement by a vote of 9-0. Ahead of the vote, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego called the agreement \u201ca great success across so many levels of government in helping Arizona become a leader in advanced manufacturing.\u201d  Under the agreement, TSMC will build a new factory and create 1,900 new full-time jobs to be phased in over a five-year period. Construction would start in early 2021, with factory production expected in 2024.  In return, the city will build three miles of streets for $61 million, spend $37 million on water infrastructure improvements and $107 million in wastewater improvements. The company will enter a formal deal with the city after selecting a site, which is expected before the end of the year.  Based in Hsinchu, Taiwan, TSMC has said it also hopes for U.S. federal subsidies to help cover the extra cost of building chips in the United States. Most of the world\u2019s advanced semiconductors are manufactured in Taiwan, including those used in U.S. military equipment, which has become a cause for concern as tensions increase between the United States and China.  American lawmakers in June proposed billions of dollars in subsides to help bolster advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. Those funds could benefit both TSMC as well as U.S. firms such as Intel Corp and Micron Technology Inc.","1754":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. app maker Blix on Monday took its fight against Apple to Europe as it laid out its grievances against the iPhone maker to EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, saying that Apple is not playing fair.  Blix\u2019s criticism came amid Vestager\u2019s ongoing investigation into Apple\u2019s App Store and mobile payment system Apple Pay as she moves to curb the power of online gatekeepers on which thousands of companies depend for business.  Blix previously sued Apple for excluding its BlueMail product from the Mac app store, accusing the company of infringing its patented technology and abusing its dominance in the app store.  Apple, which subsequently allowed BlueMail back in the digital shop, had cited security issues for the exclusion.  \u201cIt is clear to us that Apple is not playing fair,\u201d Blix founder Ben Volach wrote in a letter to Vestager seen by Reuters.  \u201cIn writing this letter, we are trying to dispel a misconception perpetrated by Apple. The App Store is not a level playing field; developers are not treated equally when they compete with Apple\u2019s own apps. Our own experience bears this out,\u201d he said.  Volach urged Vestager, who will announce by the end of the year tough new rules known as the Digital Services Act to make U.S. tech giants play fair, to look deeper into Apple\u2019s actions.  \u201cThey mask Apple\u2019s ambition to fully control this essential marketplace and distribution channel in order to maintain its apps\u2019 dominance to its competitors\u2019 disadvantage,\u201d he said.  U.S. social media giant Facebook and Microsoft recently voiced concerns about Apple\u2019s App Store rules, which the European Commission said it was aware of.","1755":"FILE PHOTO: Japan Display's logo is seen at its headquarters in Tokyo, Japan October 7, 2019.

The executive, who was fired last year for embezzling about $5.3 million over four years since 2014, made the notification on Tuesday, Japan Display said in a statement.  The revelation comes as the cash-strapped company seeks to raise at least 50 billion yen ($460 million) through a bailout deal with Apple and other investors.  The company has already launched an internal investigation with its auditors and will announce results accordingly, the statement said. The potential investors have agreed to continue talks over the bailout, it added.  The liquid crystal display (LCD) maker for smartphones has been losing money for the past five years and last week reported its 11th consecutive quarterly net loss on sluggish display sales and restructuring costs.","1756":"Aug 1 (Reuters) - A federal jury in California has awarded Canadian intellectual property company WiLan Inc $145.1 million in damages against Apple Inc for patent infringement, according to a court filing on Wednesday.

WiLan is a unit of Quarterhill Inc.  Apple was not immediately available for comment on the verdict.  In 2013, a U.S. jury ruled in favor of Apple in a separate litigation in which WiLan had sought $248 million in damages.

REUTERS\/Michaela Rehle\/File Photo  FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Anglo-German chip designer Dialog Semiconductor on Wednesday raised its second-quarter earnings outlook, citing strong revenue and gains from a transfer of assets to iPhone maker Apple.  Dialog shares were expected to open 4.3% firmer.  The company said it expects operating profit of $216 million and underlying operating profit of $82 million in the quarter, adding that it also expects revenue at 1% over the high-end of the guidance range posted in May.  The operating profit includes $28 million in one-offs, including $16 million on the transfer of assets to Apple and $12 million from non-recurring engineering contracts.  Dialog completed a $600 million deal in April to transfer programmers and patents to Apple. That delivered a cash windfall and left the smaller company less reliant on the iPhone maker, which had accounted for three-quarters of revenue.  In May, the chip designer had forecast a recovery in demand after sales of its rapid-charge products were affected in the first quarter by weak demand in China.  The company expected a sequential rise in revenue in the second quarter, and the second-half would be stronger than the first, as weakness in China faded toward the end of the first quarter, CEO Jalal Bagherli had said.  Weakness in China and mounting trade friction between Beijing and Washington had caused inventories to pile up in the semiconductor supply chain.","1758":"SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 13 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s limited trade deal with China removes a major hurdle for Apple and other technology stocks that have already surged this year to record highs.  The so-called Phase One deal announced, but still not signed, on Friday suspends the planned imposition of new 15% tariffs on Sunday that would have hit $160 billion in Chinese consumer goods just weeks before Christmas, including $115 billion worth of iPhones, laptops and other electronics.  The deal would also see the United States reduce existing tariffs on other goods. China has agreed to boost imports of U.S. energy, pharmaceutical and agricultural products, although Chinese officials offered no details on the amount of U.S. agricultural goods Beijing had agreed to buy, a sticking point of the lengthy negotiations.  If it is signed, Trump\u2019s long-awaited deal will be a relief to Apple, among the U.S. companies with the most to lose in the trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies, along with chipmakers who make the components in its devices, which are mostly made in China.  \u201cThe Street has been laser focused on this additional 15% next round of tariffs and we believe this ultimately signals a green light for tech stocks heading into year end with the impending $160 billion tariff no longer a near-term concern,\u201d Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note on Friday.  Ives estimated that the tariffs that would have hit iPhone imports on Sunday would have clipped about 4%, or 50 cents, off of Apple\u2019s 2020 earnings per share.  Even amid trade uncertainty, Apple surged over 70% this year to all-time highs on broad investor confidence in recent months that Washington and Beijing would eventually strike a deal. Apple\u2019s stock has also benefited from progress increasing its services revenue as it diversifies from declining iPhone sales.  Confidence the trade war would be settled has also pushed the S&P 500 up 26% in 2019 and fueled a 43% rally in the information technology sub-index.  The S&P extended its record-breaking run on Friday before slipping. Still, Investors are divided over whether Trump\u2019s trade deal is fully priced into the market, or whether shares of Apple, its suppliers, like Qorvo and Skyworks Solutions , and other U.S. technology and trade-sensitive stocks have room to rise.  The S&P 500 and chip stocks including Qorvo and Advanced Micro Devices pulled back a bit after details of the deal were announced in Beijing during New York trading hours, while Apple traded up 0.6%, on track for another record high close. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see some profit-taking,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, Chief Investment Strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. \u201cOn the other hand, the deal could really give corporate management better visibility into the economic outlook, and help them start spending again.\u201d  Reflecting Wall Street\u2019s mostly upbeat view toward Apple, BofA Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan on Wednesday raised his price target on the company, predicting the eventual rollout of 5G would drive three years of robust iPhone sales.  The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has surged 56% in 2019, as the rollout of 5G wireless technology appeared likely to end a downturn in global chip demand and on confidence the trade war would be resolved. The global chip market is set to recover by 5.9% in 2020 after shrinking 12.8% this year, according to a forecast last week by World Semiconductor Trade Statistics.  But gains in technology stocks have stretched their earnings multiples, increasing the risk should their bottom lines not grow next year as much as expected, or should Trump\u2019s trade deal sour. The S&P 500 information technology sector is trading at over 20 times expected earnings, its highest multiple since 2005, according to Refinitiv.  Earnings for the tech sector are expected to grow by about 10% next year after falling 1% in 2019, according to Refinitiv\u2019s I\/B\/E\/S data. That is mostly in line with broader expectations for the S&P 500, with analysts predicting around 10% profit growth next year, up from 1% in 2019.  \u201cMarkets are clearly seeing through this year\u2019s flat S&P earnings and expect much better results in 2020,\u201d Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek, wrote in a note.","1759":"LONDON (Reuters) - British police are hunting for thieves who made off with 5 million pounds ($6.6 million) worth of Apple products from iPhones to watches after tying up a driver and security guard during a truck heist in central England.

Apple runs one of the largest manufacturing chains in the world, but most of the work is done at factories owned by contractors.  Apple audited 756 suppliers in 30 countries, 197 of which it was auditing for the first time.  Apple said in its annual supplier responsibility report that the proportion of \u201clow performers,\u201d or suppliers scoring less than 59 points on its 100-point scale, fell to 1 percent in 2017 from 3 percent in 2016 and 14 percent in 2014. \u201cHigh performers\u201d with scores of more than 90 rose to a record high of 59 percent from 47 percent the year before.  Apple found 44 so-called \u201ccore violations\u201d of its labor rules in 2017, double the previous year. Those included three instances of employees forced to pay excessive fees for a job, a practice Apple banned in 2015.  In one case, over 700 foreign contract workers recruited from the Philippines were charged a total of $1 million to work for a supplier. Apple said it forced the supplier to repay the money.  Compliance with Apple\u2019s 60-hour work week fell to 94 percent of suppliers from 98 percent the year before. Moreover, Apple said it uncovered 38 cases of falsification of working hours data in 2017, up from 9 cases the year before.  Apple said the increase was driven by the fact that it brought on a number of new suppliers in 2017 and started tracking the working hours data of 1.3 million supplier employees, 30 percent more than in previous years.  In the report, Apple also said it was launching a new women\u2019s\u2019 health initiative at its supplier plants, with a goal of reaching 1 million women by 2020. And it said that it had launched a program in China to train workers to become factory line leaders, who often make 20 percent to 30 percent more than line workers.  On Wednesday, Apple also issued its so-called conflict minerals report, which is required by United States securities regulators. The report lists suppliers of sensitive metals such as tin and gold.  Apple company said that 16 smelters and refiners left its supply chain in 2017, 10 of which were dropped because they would not participate in a third-party audit of their practices.

The discounting, as steep as $118 for the recently launched 64GB iPhone XR, is the latest sign that Apple\u2019s weak holiday sales in China may have extended to the current quarter.  The price cuts on iPhones by Chinese retailers began in the middle of this week, with at least six offering promotions this weekend, according to checks done by Reuters.  Apple did not respond to requests for comment. Prices for iPhones sold through its Chinese website remained unchanged.  Such widespread price cuts are not uncommon around shopping festivals like Single\u2019s Day in November, but these cuts stand out as they affect Apple\u2019s latest XS and XR models that were released only months ago, said Mo Jia, a Canalys analyst who tracks China\u2019s smartphone industry.

For the whole of 2018, Apple was set to sell about 2 million phones - a drop of about a million from last year, he said, as Indians baulk at high prices for the devices, driven by trade tariffs and a weak rupee.  \u201cSales are set to drop for the first time in four years,\u201d Shah said. \u201cIf you look at Q3 - it was 900k last year and this (year) is almost 450k.  \u201cIphones have gone costlier and the features and specs aren\u2019t that compelling. The install base of android has grown vastly; the new customer base (for Apple) is not coming.\u201d  Cook on Thursday called the company\u2019s problems in India \u201cspeed bumps along a very long journey\u201d and most analysts say that the prestige of Apple\u2019s brand should allow it to claim back lost ground as Indians\u2019 spending power continues to grow.  Shah said that, while more than half the phones sold this year were older iPhone models, high selling prices meant Apple\u2019s Indian revenue should still be flat or slightly higher than a year ago.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said a lower court should consider whether it was appropriate to recalculate damages without holding a new trial.","1770":"(Reuters) - When Apple Inc AAPL.O reports results on Wednesday, Wall Street expects flat fiscal fourth-quarter sales and lower full-year revenue compared with the prior year, mostly because of declining iPhone sales. Yet Apple's stock price has hit all-time highs in recent weeks, and its price-to-forward-earnings valuation is higher than it has been since 2010.  FILE PHOTO: Apple CEO Tim Cook arrives to the global premiere for Apple's \"The Morning Show\" at the Lincoln Center in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S., October 28, 2019. REUTERS\/Eduardo Munoz  Investors and analysts told Reuters that much of the explanation lies in Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook\u2019s skillful management of relationships in Washington, Beijing and Wall Street.  Cook has fostered a relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, dining with him and conveying Apple\u2019s views on tariffs and U.S. manufacturing. He has also kept strong enough relations with Chinese officials to avoid Apple becoming a target of explicit retaliation after the U.S. government moved to cut off Huawei Technologies Co Ltd - Apple\u2019s arch rival in the premium smartphone market in China - from American technology.  Along the way, Cook has persuaded Wall Street that Apple can transition from the iPhone to a broader constellation of products that includes streaming video and even a credit card, along with accessories like AirPods and the Apple Watch.  Even investors who were already impressed by Cook\u2019s business acumen - he masterminded Apple\u2019s supply chain and operations under the late CEO Steve Jobs - have been pleasantly surprised by Cook\u2019s ability to avoid taking fatal arrows from either side in the U.S.-China trade war.  \u201cWho would have thought he would have been able to thread that needle and deal with the president? It\u2019s a show of an incredible amount of nuance and emotional intelligence to do what\u2019s best for the company,\u201d said Hal Eddins, chief economist for Capital Investment Cos, an Apple shareholder.  China remains a challenge for Apple. Sales there fell sharply early in the current fiscal year when currency fluctuations put iPhones out of reach for many Chinese consumers. Apple cut prices, which helped, but rival Huawei has gained share.  Apple\u2019s share of the Chinese market fell to 5.2% in the calendar third quarter versus 7% a year ago, while Huawei, which sells many more low-cost models than Apple does, saw its market share surge to 42.4% from 24.9% the year before, Canalys data showed.  \u201cA year ago, we were talking about the price pushback in China, and (Apple) contended they were overcoming that,\u201d said Tom Plumb, founder of Wisconsin Capital Management, an Apple shareholder. \u201cNow the real question is whether you\u2019re seeing a cultural shift that would bode poorly for Apple.\u201d  But many Apple investors have likely already priced in a loss of China market share to domestic rivals in the long term.  \u201cIf the industry is worth being in, you should assume that over the course of time it\u2019s going to be dominated by Chinese national champions,\u201d said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan.  Apple shares were down 0.5% to $242 at midday on Wednesday after reports that Chilean officials had canceled a summit at which the United States and China were expected to take major steps toward a trade deal.  Cook has also persuaded investors that services such as Apple TV+, coming next month, will boost sales. Investors are optimistic, but worry that Apple could be drawn into spending battles over Hollywood talent against entrenched rivals such as Walt Disney Co DIS.N.  \u201cWe\u2019re not huge advocates of them spending huge amounts of cash reserves on content generation,\u201d said John Ham of New England Investment & Retirement Group Inc, which holds Apple shares. \u201cBut as long as they don\u2019t get carried away and start making outsized, egregious deals, then we would support them dabbling in this area.\u201d","1771":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - A second trial between Apple Inc AAPL.O and Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O before the U.S. International Trade Commission began Monday in Washington, D.C., with the iPhone maker squaring off against the world's biggest mobile chipmaker over whether Apple should be banned from importing several recent iPhone models to the United States.  Apple and Qualcomm are locked in a wide-ranging legal dispute in which Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices. Qualcomm, the world\u2019s largest mobile phone chipmaker, has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement.  Monday's trial is the second of two Qualcomm is pursuing against Apple at the ITC in which it is asking trade judges to ban the import of certain iPhone models containing Intel Corp INTC.O modem chips, which help phones connect to wireless data networks.  Import bans are rare, and Apple would have time potentially to change the design of its devices to avoid any patent infringement the courts may find. But Apple has come to rely more heavily on Intel for modem chips, with Qualcomm officials telling investors in July that its chips are not in the newest iPhone models.  At the first trial, which concluded in June, a U.S. staff attorney recommended that the judge find Apple infringed at least one Qualcomm battery-saving patent and that some Intel-chipped phones should be blocked from coming into the U.S. market. But the attorney said that models with so-called 5G, the next generation of wireless network, should be allowed to keep the market for 5G chips competitive.  The ITC staff acts as a third party in such trade cases. The staff lawyers\u2019 opinions are not binding, but judges often follow them. A decision in that case is expected later this month.  Monday\u2019s trial began concerns three patents. Two of them relate to how Intel\u2019s modem chips handle radio signals, and one relates to how Apple\u2019s processor chips put its iPhones to sleep.  While blocking iPhones is a drastic step, Apple would have several chances to appeal the decision, including to U.S. President Donald Trump. In 2013, then-President Barack Obama overturned a ban on some Apple iPads and iPhones that arose out of a dispute with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS.  The more consequential outcome of the ITC cases is for Qualcomm to test whether its patents are upheld under court scrutiny. It is suing Apple over many of the same patents in civil lawsuits that take longer to process, and the ITC case may give an early indication of how those civil lawsuits could ultimately play out.","1772":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Bureau of Investigation did not exhaust possible solutions to unlock an iPhone connected to a gunman involved in a late-2015 shooting spree before seeking a court order to compel Apple Inc AAPL.O to help access the device, a U.S. Justice Department internal watchdog said on Tuesday.  The iPhone logo is reflected in a new Apple iPhone X in this illustration picture, November 2, 2017. REUTERS\/Maxim Shemetov\/Illustration  The conclusion may pose challenges for the Trump administration in possible future litigation to force companies to help crack into encrypted devices. Senior U.S. officials have sought in recent months to revive a debate over whether encryption on devices should be weakened to allow law enforcement easier access to data belonging to criminal suspects.  Apple declined to comment.  According to a report by the Justice Department\u2019s office of inspector general, an FBI unit that breaks into mobile devices only began seeking outside help to unlock the iPhone tied to the gunman in the shooting in San Bernardino, California, on the eve of the February 2016 court filing demanding Apple\u2019s assistance.  The FBI unit chief knew that one of the vendors contacted had almost 90 percent completed a technical solution that would unlock the iPhone, the report said. The Justice Department said at the time it required Apple\u2019s assistance because it lacked other means to access the device.  Apple refused to help, prompting a high-stakes legal and public relations confrontation that ended when the FBI said an unidentified nongovernment party had come forward with a way to crack the phone.  Communication failures at the FBI caused some officials to misunderstand the status of its own efforts to open the device, and contributed to delays in seeking help from the FBI unit and the vendor that was ultimately successful, the report said.  \u201cThe lack of coordination resulted in a \u201cbelatedly-obtained technical solution\u201d that forced the government to withdraw its court filing stating it could not access the iPhone, it added.  The FBI told the inspector general there was no delay in developing the technique that opened the iPhone and that the vendor had proactively notified officials of the cracking method.  The review also found no evidence that then-FBI Director James Comey made inaccurate statements when he testified about the agency\u2019s iPhone unlocking efforts before Congress in February and March 2016. Comey was fired last year by President Donald Trump, who has accused him of being dishonest about private meetings the two of them had before his firing.  Technology companies and many digital security experts have said that the FBI\u2019s attempts to require that devices allow easier access a criminal suspect\u2019s cellphone would harm internet security and empower malicious hackers.  U.S. lawmakers have expressed little interest in pursuing legislation to require companies to create easier access.  FBI Director Chris Wray said in January that the bureau was unable to access data from nearly 7,800 devices in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 with technical tools despite possessing proper legal authority to pry them open.","1773":"Feb 5 (Reuters) - Lumentum Holdings Inc, which supplies sensors for Apple\u2019s FaceId feature, forecast third-quarter revenue below analysts\u2019 estimates hurt by slowing demand for smartphones in China.

An Apple Store employee shows the new Series 5 Apple Watch during the preview of the redesigned and reimagined Apple Fifth Avenue store in New York, U.S., September 19, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid -  Last year, Apple's Heart Study here found that the watch could accurately detect atrial fibrillation, the most common type of irregular heartbeat, according to a study that explored the role of wearable devices in identifying potential heart problems. Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke more than fivefold, according to the American Heart Association.  Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, said the initial study proved the Apple Watch can detect atrial fibrillation with a low rate of false alarms, which helped Apple gain clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a watch app that takes an electrocardiogram, or EKG, measurement. The study with J&J aims to show if early detection leads to better health outcomes.  \u201cWe want to follow the science all the way to the end, no matter what the outcomes are, and run this longitudinal study,\u201d Williams told Reuters in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that we have to do, but it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d  The joint effort, called \u201cHeartline,\u201d is significant because J&J is one of the world\u2019s largest medical device makers and pharmaceutical companies.  \u201cWhat we bring is clinical study capability on a very large scale,\u201d said Paul Stoffels, J&J\u2019s chief scientific officer, who said the study aims to track 150,000 participants with long-term follow-ups over two years.  The study could also reach a different population than Apple\u2019s original heart study, which included 400,000 participants but faced questions from medical experts because more than half of the people who signed up were under 40, a group already at low risk for atrial fibrillation.  J&J targeted the study at population with a higher risk. Paul Burton, vice president of medical affairs at the J&J subsidiary running the study, said 70% of patients experiencing the condition are over 65.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do here is definitively answer that question: If you take wearable technology and couple it with an app, can you reduce the risk of a stroke or death?\u201d Burton said.  The J&J study will be open to the more than 40 million people enrolled in traditional Medicare plans, which cover people aged 65 and older as well as the disabled. Study participants will be randomly assigned to either use only an iPhone app or use the app in conjunction with a watch capable of taking an EKG.  If patients who enroll are assigned to the arm of the study using the Apple Watch, they will be prompted to acquire one of the devices, which study officials said the participants can either purchase on their own for personal use for $49 or borrow free of charge for the study.  The latest Apple Watch model starts at list price of $399. Burton said J&J and Apple were sharing the cost of subsidizing the watches.  The study will pay participants, who must agree to share their Medicare claims data. Apple and J&J officials said that was key to proving whether the use of the app and watch lead to reduced stroke risk.  \u201cWith tens of millions of watches on people\u2019s wrists and us delivering this early detection, we have a huge responsibility to make sure that early detection is effective and really helping people with their health in the long haul,\u201d Apple\u2019s Williams told Reuters.","1775":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window)  * Apple share split prompts Dow reshuffle  * Consumer confidence, new home sales jump  * Dow dips 0.45%, S&P up 0.10%, Nasdaq rises 0.36% (Updates to late afternoon, changes dateline, byline)  NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 edged higher on Tuesday, with a drop in Apple stock capping gains from positive developments in U.S.-China trade and fresh progress in the medical battle against the coronavirus pandemic.
