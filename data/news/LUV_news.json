YORK (Reuters) - Federal investigators on Thursday said the engine fan blade that broke apart during a Southwest Airlines flight last month showed signs consistent with metal fatigue, as inspectors probe the first passenger fatality on a U.S. airline in nearly a decade.  FILE PHOTO: A U.S. NTSB investigator is on scene examining damage to the engine of the Southwest Airlines plane in this image released from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S., April 17, 2018. NTSB\/Handout via REUTERS\/File Photo  The accident touched off a scramble to inspect similar equipment. U.S. regulators this week broadened a directive to check the fan blades in hundreds of engines similar to the one that blew apart.  The identification of metal fatigue, the degradation of a metal\u2019s structural integrity over repeated use, could necessitate more frequent and more comprehensive inspections of these parts.  The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said it found six crack lines on the fan blade that separated and tore through the engine\u2019s cowling during Southwest Flight 1380.  The NTSB\u2019s investigation is ongoing to determine how long it takes for fan blades begin to show signs of fatigue and whether current inspection measures can effectively detect cracks.  \u201cWe continue to cooperate fully with the National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s ongoing investigation into flight 1380. Safety is our top priority at Southwest, and we appreciate the efforts of the NTSB Investigators in developing today\u2019s Preliminary Report,\u201d Southwest said in a statement.  Southwest has been under intense scrutiny since April 17, when a fan blade on the Boeing 737\u2019s CFM56 jet engine broke apart mid-flight, shattering a window and nearly sucking a woman out of the plane. The woman died of her injuries, marking the first U.S. airline passenger fatality since 2009.  The Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday ordered additional inspections of fan blades in hundreds of additional engines similar to the one that failed in the Southwest incident. [nL1N1S80FH]  Southwest has said it planned to complete ultrasonic inspections on all fan blades on the some 700 planes in its fleet with CFM56-7B engines over the next two weeks, meeting the FAA\u2019s August deadline by mid-May.  The CFM engine is made by a joint venture of General Electric Co and France\u2019s Safran.  Southwest said it has not found any cracks on fan blades inspected since the accident.","1":"(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration says it should have done a better job of ensuring Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N had certified completion of maintenance on 88 used Boeing 737 jets, as noted in a report by the U.S. Transportation Department's Inspector General released on Tuesday.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Budget-friendly Southwest bought the planes in question between 2013 and 2017 from 16 foreign carriers.  The final report, first seen by Reuters, said Southwest operated more than 150,000 flights carrying 17.2 million passengers on the jets without confirmation that required maintenance had been completed.  The report said the FAA has not \u201ceffectively overseen Southwest Airlines\u2019 systems for managing risks\u201d and made 11 recommendations to improve oversight, including retraining inspectors and developing better control over maintenance records and inspector guidance on evaluating air carrier safety culture.  While the U.S. commercial airline industry is considered safe, with only one fatality in recent years, the FAA is under heightened scrutiny by lawmakers over its relationship with the industry after two crashes overseas on the newer Boeing Co BA.N 737 MAX killed 346 people and led to that aircraft's global grounding.  \u201cGiven the significant unresolved safety concerns that FAA has identified at Southwest Airlines, it is clear that the agency is not yet effectively navigating the balance between industry collaboration and managing safety risks at the carrier,\u201d the report said.  The FAA said in a response included with the report it concurred with all 11 recommendations and the inspector general\u2019s conclusion that its office overseeing Southwest did not perform in accordance with existing guidance by allowing the 88 planes to enter service and that it \u201clacked a comprehensive conformity inspection for used aircraft.\u201d  Southwest told Reuters on Tuesday that eight of the 88 jets remain out of service until needed repairs are completed and that it disagreed with the report\u2019s findings.  The report chided the FAA, saying the agency \u201caccepted the air carrier\u2019s justification that the issues identified were low safety risks.\u201d  The FAA noted it changed the leadership of its office that oversees Southwest and \u201ccontinues to address deficiencies in the work functions and culture.\u201d The agency has agreed to ensure Southwest \u201ccomplies with regulatory requirements that the 88 previously owned aircraft conform to U.S. aviation standards.\u201d  Last month, the Wall Street Journal published an article on a draft of the inspector general report.  The report also said the FAA violated its own guidance in addressing noncompliance by Southwest on baggage weight and balance data. The FAA agreed to ensure Southwest complies with requirements.  On Jan. 10, the FAA said it was seeking to impose a $3.92 million fine on Southwest for alleged weight infractions on 21,505 flights on 44 aircraft between May 1, 2018 and Aug. 9, 2018.  Southwest has said it is working with the FAA to demonstrate the effectiveness of its controls and seek a resolution on the proposed penalty.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co, the biggest user of Boeing Co\u2019s 737 MAX jets that were grounded worldwide following two fatal crashes, dropped two places from the top in terms of passenger satisfaction in 2019, a survey by the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) showed.  Southwest was ranked third this year out of 10 airlines, behind Alaska Air Group Inc and JetBlue Airways Corp that climbed one place each to claim the first and the second spot.  \u201cRecent deadly crashes of the Boeing 737 Max (for Ethiopian Airlines and Air Lion) have left Southwest particularly vulnerable to safety concerns,\u201d ACSI said in a report.  Passenger satisfaction for all airlines on average in 2019 was up 1.4 percent to 74 points, with Alaska scoring 80 points on a scale of 0 to 100, and JetBlue and Southwest got 79 each.  American Airlines Group Inc, the No.1 U.S. airline that has the second-biggest fleet of the grounded MAX jets in the United States, lost 1 point to score 73, but maintained its fifth rank in the chart.  American has grounded its 24 737 MAX jetliners until Aug. 19, leading to about 115 daily cancellations during the peak summer travel season.  Southwest lost more than $200 million in revenue during the first quarter and has taken its 34 MAX aircraft out of the company\u2019s flying schedule through Aug. 5.  Delta Air Lines Inc gained 1 point to get a score of 75 and maintained its rank at the fourth spot. United Continental Holdings Inc added 4 points to earn a score of 70, while also keeping its seventh rank as last year.  ACSI measures passenger satisfaction scores based on interviews with thousands of customers across a range of metrics including timeliness of arrival, baggage handling, loyalty program, cleanliness and in-flight entertainment.","5":"SEATTLE (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co said on Friday it was pulling its Boeing Co 737 MAX jets from flight schedules through May, extending its earlier timeline from April 20, according to a company memorandum seen by Reuters.  \u201cThis will impact the lines in May, but, now that the decision has been made, we can construct our schedule without those flights well in advance in hopes to minimize the daily disruptions,\u201d the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association and the company said in the joint memorandum.  Boeing\u2019s top-selling 737 MAX jetliner has been grounded in the wake of two deadly crashes involving that model in five months, one in Indonesia last October and another on March 10 in Ethiopia.","6":"(Reuters) - To convince Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N to buy the Boeing 737 MAX, the plane maker reassured the airline that pilots would not need expensive simulator training and backed up the promise with a $1 million per plane rebate if training was needed, U.S. lawmakers said on Wednesday.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The 737 MAX training requirements were a topic of questioning at a hearing centered on Boeing Co's BA.N development of the aircraft that has come under scrutiny following two fatal crashes.  Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, asked Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg about the Southwest rebate, which he said would have covered 280 orders for the 737 MAX.  Muilenburg said he \u201cbelieved that was part of the contract structure we had with Southwest.\u201d He added \u201cit\u2019s not uncommon for us to have incentive clauses in these contracts.\u201d  A spokesman for Southwest, one of Boeing\u2019s largest 737 MAX customers, said he did not have specific details on the contractual agreement with Boeing but said it was a standard agreement on 737 MAX aircraft delivery.  \u201cWe have customary language in each of our delivery contracts to hold parties accountable to previously determined benefits of launching a new aircraft type, incorporating guarantees for various items into every contract from the 737-300s to the 737 NGs, a standard practice that is not new to us, the industry or the MAX aircraft,\u201d Southwest said.  DeFazio said that if the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had required simulator training on the 737 MAX, it \u201cwould have cost Boeing hundreds of millions of dollars and given its competitor an advantage.\u201d  At the time, Airbus SE AIR.PA was courting large carriers like American Airlines Group AAL.O with a new, fuel-efficient narrowbody jet to rival the 737, triggering Boeing's decision to make a new 737 model with more fuel-efficient engines rather than developing an all-new plane, which would have taken longer, sources have said.  Changes in the new model led to the need for software known as MCAS that played a role in both fatal crashes.  Boeing has been working on revised pilot training and software updates for the 737 MAX to win approval for commercial flights following an eight-month global grounding in the wake of the two crashes.","7":"FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: grounded Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft are shown parked at Victorville Airport in Victorville, California, U.S., March 26, 2019.

Low-cost carrier Southwest recently unveiled plans to launch service at Chicago O\u2019Hare and Houston\u2019s George Bush Intercontinental Airport, two United hubs, next year, as well as places like Palm Springs, California, and Sarasota, Florida.  On Thursday it added Jackson, Mississippi, to the list.  \u201cThere\u2019s more coming,\u201d Kelly said at a virtual Wings Club event.  He said the marginal cost of adding a flight is \u201cvery modest,\u201d assuming there is demand for the route, given the airline\u2019s current 20% overstaffing and hundreds of parked airplanes as overall travel demand remains depressed.  The destinations are intended to be permanent additions to Southwest\u2019s network, he said.  Asked whether the carrier had seen a rise in cancellations following its decision to stop blocking middle seats, Kelly said there had been an increase but attributed it to the spike in COVID-19 cases across the country rather than the middle seat policy change, which took effect this month.","8":"Sept 16 (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co said on Wednesday it now expects cash burn to slow to $17 million per day in the third quarter, as airlines continued to top the list of industries hit by the coronavirus crisis.

Social distancing on planes has become a topic of debate as airlines weigh safety measures to restore confidence in air travel that has collapsed during the coronavirus pandemic.  \u201cYou won\u2019t see full flights on Southwest at least through the end of July, and if we do have more demand for that flight, we\u2019ll add additional flights to meet demand,\u201d Kelly said at its annual shareholders\u2019 meeting, which was held virtually.

Airlines have been operating about 90% fewer flights than normal but are gradually adding flights back to their schedules as demand begins picking up.  Southwest said on Tuesday it recorded positive bookings on a net basis so far this month as passenger reservations outpaced trip cancellations, helping the company slow its cash burn rate.  The company currently has $13 billion cash in the bank that will carry it through at least 20 months at current blast rates, Kelly said, and likely many more months than that \u201cbecause I do think things continue to improve.\u201d  Southwest\u2019s June capacity will be roughly half its schedule a year ago - an improvement from a 60% to 70% reduction in May.","10":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines LUV.N Chief Executive Gary Kelly said on Thursday that the airline was not running dramatic fare sales in response to a drop-off in demand due to the spreading coronavirus.  \u201cWe could discount prices tomorrow and it wouldn\u2019t do any good,\u201d Kelly said at an aviation conference.

The engine on the plane\u2019s left side spewed shrapnel when it blew apart, shattering a window and causing rapid cabin depressurization, the NTSB said. In 2018, the NTSB said two passengers were eventually able to pull Riordan, who was still in her seat belt, back inside the plane.  At least 14 passengers have sued the airline, Boeing and CFM and at least 11 have settled, according to court filings.  Last November, the NTSB held an investigative hearing into the accident that disclosed the flight crew initially had difficulty reaching flight attendants after the engine failed and did not immediately learn a passenger had been injured.  On Tuesday, Southwest said in a statement it appreciated the work of the NTSB \u201cand each of the parties working to determine the probable cause of the accident. We all have the same goals: to share facts, learn what happened, and prevent this type of event from ever happening again.\u201d  CFM International is a transatlantic joint-venture between General Electric Co and France\u2019s Safran SA.  Barry S. Alexander, a lawyer representing Southwest, told a federal judge in New York Friday in a case involving two passengers that the NTSB has taken and retained custody of certain components from the aircraft involved in the accident, including parts from the engine.  \u201cFederal regulations prevent the parties to this lawsuit from accessing them while the NTSB\u2019s investigations are ongoing,\u201d Alexander wrote, adding Southwest intends to seek dismissal of the lawsuit.  Boeing told the court it plans to ask that the case be dismissed on a number of grounds.","12":"(Reuters) - A Southwest Airlines Co Boeing 737 MAX 8 heading to the California desert for parking during a global ban of the aircraft made an emergency landing on Tuesday due to an engine-related problem shortly after take-off, the carrier said.  It did not have any passengers and the issue was not related to a computer system on the 737 MAX aircraft that has come under scrutiny following two fatal crashes, one on Lion Air and another on Ethiopian Airlines, since October, the airline said.  \u201cThe crew followed protocol and safely landed back at the airport,\u201d Southwest said in a statement.  Southwest Flight 8701 returned to Orlando International Airport just before 3 p.m. ET (1900 GMT) after pilots reported a performance issue with one of the engines, the airline said.  The flight was scheduled to fly from Orlando to a logistics airport in Victorville, California, near the Mojave desert, where Southwest began flying its fleet of 34 MAX jets for storage.  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration grounded the 737 MAX following the two crashes but has allowed airlines to conduct flights without passengers to move planes to other airports.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  Budget-friendly Southwest spent seven years in contract negotiations with a separate union that represents its mechanics before reaching an agreement last year.  Now, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), representing 7,852 Southwest workers, has invoked its right to mediation with the National Mediation Board.  \u201cWhile many contract issues remain unresolved, the one issue that has completely derailed negotiations is Southwest\u2019s treatment of its employees,\u201d IAM said in a statement, citing demands that employees return to work after their shift has ended, forcing overtime.  Instead, IAM said the airline should properly staff its operation.  In an emailed statement, Southwest\u2019s labor relations vice president, Russell McCrady, called the union\u2019s mediation filing \u201cthe next logical step to promptly find solutions to a few remaining items.\u201d  Under the current contract, Southwest can call for mandatory overtime when necessary, a standard practice in the airline industry, McCrady said, but added that currently mandatory overtime \u201caccounts for a historically-low one percent of total hours worked by this group.\u201d  He said the company has proposed changes during negotiations that would further reduce that percentage and protect employees\u2019 days off.  Under the Railway Labor Act, the law governing labor relations in the airline industry, a company or union must seek federal mediation for help in resolving negotiations before taking other action.  Analysts have highlighted labor issues as a major concern for airlines this year, in addition to rising fuel costs and the grounding of Boeing Co\u2019s 737 MAX jets after two fatal crashes.  American Airlines Group Inc reached a tentative joint collective bargaining agreement with its mechanics last month after years of bitter negotiations and is in talks with its pilots and flight attendants.  Early contract talks between Southwest and its pilots union are due to begin the first week of March, a spokesman for the union said.  Southwest\u2019s negotiations with its mechanics union, the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, were fraught with flight disruptions and legal disputes. Although a contract was reached, litigation is still ongoing.  On Thursday the mechanics union said it was \u201csadly not surprised\u201d by a federal watchdog report this week that faulted Southwest and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on safety, prompting some lawmakers to call for improvements.  Southwest has disputed the findings.","17":"Oct 24 (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co reported a 7.2% rise in third-quarter profit on Thursday, as strong travel demand and higher fares offset the hit from flight cancellations due to the grounding of its Boeing 737 MAX jets.  The budget-friendly U.S. airline, which only flies 737 planes and has the world\u2019s largest MAX fleet, said it took a $210 million hit to operating income in the quarter from the ongoing grounding.  Southwest said last week it was postponing the return of the 737 MAX jets to its flight schedule until Feb. 8.  Unit revenue in the quarter ended Sept. 30, however, grew 4.2%, while average fares rose 1.7%, as the company successfully controlled costs from the MAX grounding.  \u201cWe continue to control costs despite significant year-over-year unit cost pressures resulting from the MAX,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Gary C. Kelly said.  \u201cBased on these trends (in customer demand and revenue) and current bookings, we are expecting another positive year-over-year unit revenue performance in fourth quarter 2019.\u201d  The company also said it would save some money on the delay in deliveries of more MAX jets, cutting its projected 2019 capital expenditure to between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion from a prior range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion.  That was based on the assumption that Boeing will meet its target of gaining regulatory approval for a MAX return to service in the fourth quarter.  Dallas, Texas-based Southwest said net income rose to $659 million, or $1.23 per share from $615 million, or $1.08 per share, a year earlier.  Total operating revenue rose 1.1% to $5.64 billion. (Reporting by Sanjana Shivdas in Bengaluru; editing by Shinjini Ganguli)","18":"(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N said on Tuesday it has agreed with Boeing Co BA.N to sharply cut its 737 MAX delivery schedule through 2021 and is reviewing its order book as the coronavirus pandemic caused its first quarterly loss in nine years.  Southwest, which only operates Boeing 737s and is the world\u2019s largest customer of the grounded 737 MAX, will take no more than 48 new 737 MAX jets before Dec. 2021, a fraction of the 123 it had originally scheduled.  However, it has no current plans to cancel orders, Chief Financial Officer Tammy Romo said on a conference call, noting that a more fuel-efficient fleet \u201cis still relevant and meaningful\u201d even given current low oil prices and demand.  Just months ago, airlines including Southwest were cancelling flights and delaying growth plans and aircraft retirements because the 737 MAX grounding left them without enough planes.  Dallas-based Southwest has removed its 34 MAX planes from its fleet until Oct. 30 as the aircraft awaits regulatory approval to fly again following two fatal crashes.  As passenger demand has neared zero due to the COVID-19 crisis, airlines are parking hundreds of jets, accelerating aircraft retirement plans and deferring jet deliveries as the industry braces for a slow recovery.  Both Boeing and European planemaker Airbus SE AIR.PA are due to publish quarterly results on Wednesday.  Southwest swung to a $94-million net loss in the first quarter from a $387 million profit a year earlier, and warned that operating revenues would fall by 90-95% in both April and May, when it does not expect load factors to surpass 10%.  Total operating revenue fell 17.8% to $4.2 billion in the quarter.  FILE PHOTO: Southwest planes sit in a desert graveyard near Victorville, California, U.S. March 28, 2018.

Facing unprecedented flight cancellations, airlines are scrambling to preserve and raise cash.  Southwest had $9.3 billion in cash on hand as of April 24, with leverage of 47%.  On Tuesday it announced an additional capital raise including a public stock offering of 55 million shares, worth around $1.6 billion at Monday\u2019s closing price of $29.11, and $1 billion worth of convertible debt.  Shares rose 1.6% to $29.57.  Southwest\u2019s average daily cash burn will slow to between $30 million and $35 million in the second quarter, it said.  The airline is receiving about $3.3 billion in government payroll support and is considering tapping an additional $2.8 billion in secured government loans under the stimulus package known as the CARES Act.  The coronavirus outbreak has led to the deaths of more than 207,000 people, including more than 55,000 in the United States, a Reuters tally shows.  Stay-at-home orders remain in place across much of the world and it is an open question as to when people will feel comfortable traveling again and under what safety requirements.  Airlines including Southwest support pre-boarding temperature checks, face masks and social distancing measures on airplanes and in airports.  Under the terms of government payroll support, airlines cannot lay off employees before Sept. 30. If demand remains weak, Southwest has said it may need to downsize.  Excluding special items, Southwest\u2019s quarterly net loss was $77 million, or a $0.15 loss per share.

FILE PHOTO: In this file photo, Boeing employees work on the tail of a Boeing 737 NG at the Boeing plant in Renton, Washington Dec 7, 2015.REUTERS\/Matt Mills McKnight\/File Photo  Southwest said it had taken two planes out of service, while Gol had grounded 11. Both airlines are major operators of the 737, including the NG variant and the more recent MAX, which has been grounded for months after two deadly crashes.  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration last week told aircraft operators to inspect 165 older 737 NG planes for structural cracks within seven days, after cracking was found on a small number of planes. Nearly all the 165 jets were Southwest aircraft, officials said.  First delivered in 1997, the NG is the third generation of the 737, preceding the grounded MAX, which is unaffected by the cracking issues.  Southwest, which did not find any issues in the \u201cvast majority\u201d of planes, said it \u201cremoved the two aircraft from our operation and reported the findings to Boeing and the FAA.\u201d  Gol, which runs a fleet of 115 737s excluding its grounded MAX jets, said it took 11 out of service after finding \u201cevidence of the need to replace a specific component.\u201d The fleet change will affect 3% of passengers until Dec. 15, it said.  The inspections were ordered following the discovery of cracks on a part known as the \u201cpickle fork,\u201d which attaches the fuselage to the wing structure and manages forces.  Minor aircraft cracks are not unusual, an industry source said, but are not normally expected to occur on the pickle fork until near the end of the plane\u2019s lifespan, typically considered to be more than 90,000 takeoff and landing cycles.  The FAA mandated checks for \u201ccracking of the left and right hand side outboard chords of frame fittings and failsafe straps,\u201d warning the issue \u201ccould adversely affect the structural integrity of the airplane\u201d and result in loss of control. More planes will eventually be inspected, it said.  The initial inspection order covered a total of 1,911 U.S.-registered planes. The checks can be done visually and take about an hour per airplane.  Aircraft that have carried out more than 30,000 flight legs, or cycles, must be checked within seven days, the safety regulator said, while those with 22,600-29,999 cycles must be checked before completing a further 1,000.  Boeing has been in touch with 737 NG operators about the inspections, the manufacturer said earlier, emphasizing that \u201cno in-service issues have been reported.\u201d  United Airlines and American Airlines Inc are among other U.S. carriers flying the 737 NG, which includes the 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER variants.  Each airline has about 80 planes that will need inspection in coming months, United and American said, but none that fall into the seven-day requirement for more urgent checks.  European budget carrier Ryanair, which has a fleet of more than 450 737-800s, confirmed it was in the process of carrying out the inspections, without saying how many planes required them.  \u201cWe are midway through the first part of this mandatory check program and don\u2019t expect it will have any impact upon our fleet or operations,\u201d a Ryanair spokeswoman said.  Transavia Airlines, a low-cost carrier owned by Air France-KLM, said it would examine all 42 of its 737s even though only 16 need checks under the FAA mandate - of which one was inspected under the seven-day requirement. KLM, which also operates 737 NGs, has inspected all but one of 13 aircraft covered by the order and found no anomalies, a spokesman said.  Jeju Air, a South Korean low-cost operator, had also completed the majority of required checks, while inspections were ongoing at domestic rival Jin Air and had been completed at Eastar Jet.

Snapchat\u2019s owner may have been hurt by the surge in popularity of viral video app TikTok, but Evan Spiegel\u2019s firm can also take advantage of its rival\u2019s headaches. The U.S. government sees the ByteDance-owned service as a national-security risk and wants to ban it.  Snap has already gained from the ad boycott at Facebook, which helped spur a 17% jump in Snap\u2019s revenue. Alluding to his bigger competitor\u2019s troubles, Spiegel said the growing focus on brand safety and privacy puts Snap in a unique position. He could say the same about TikTok. Oh snap! (By Gina Chon)  LONG WINTER. European airlines are flying into gloomier trading conditions. That was the message from the chief executives who met virtually on Wednesday, as they pressed to extend a waiver on rules governing landing slots. In normal times, carriers are required to use 80% of their slots or forfeit these highly valued assets. European regulators eased the rules during lockdown, but only until October.  Executives including Air France-KLM boss Ben Smith and Kenton Jarvis, CEO of TUI Aviation, say returning closer to normality will take longer. Airlines typically lose money in the winter anyway, but lockdown and fears of catching Covid-19 in the skies have dampened demand further. The airlines, many of which have raised capital or sought government support, have talked of an eventual recovery in passenger numbers. Smith has reassured investors he is ramping up flight frequencies. First, however, carriers need to get through a harsh winter. (By Aimee Donnellan)  HOME IMPROVEMENT. The end of lockdown has done little to dampen the DIY boom. Consumers who were confined at home tackled home repairs and gardening jobs with such enthusiasm that Kingfisher, the 5 billion pound operator of B&Q in the United Kingdom and Castorama in France, on Wednesday released an unscheduled trading update. Sales soared 25% in June from a year earlier, having increased 15% in May. Online sales, however, were the clear winner as demand for items that can be delivered, such as wallpaper, fences and plants, leapt 225%.  Running a DIY retailer is also getting cheaper. Although Kingfisher had to pay for protective equipment for staff, including barriers and hand sanitiser, its advertising and marketing budget fell as customers needed little encouragement to enter their stores. Kingfisher\u2019s share price rose nearly 10% on Wednesday. The longer consumers\u2019 desire to upgrade and refurbish persists, the happier investors will be. (By Aimee Donnellan)  HOME SICK. Hong Kong is shutting down once again. The financial hub has recorded a spike in Covid-19 cases since July 13, logging over 50 cases daily and a high of 108. Foreign students were blamed for a second wave in March, and now fingers are being pointed at flight crews, sailors and senior executives exempted from quarantine.  The local government has defended the exceptions. Financial services, trade and logistics account for a total of two-fifths of Hong Kong\u2019s economy, and they can\u2019t work well, or at all, unless their staff can move across borders. So authorities are hesitant to impose stricter measures, perhaps with an eye on fellow hub Singapore, which reported a 41% fall in GDP after its own lockdown. But of course a third major outbreak will cancel the benefits of selective relaxation. It is a harrowing warning for what\u2019s ahead of the curve for the many metropolises still trying to flatten it. (By Jamie Lo)  MIND THE GAP. London\u2019s Central Line emptied out in March, as did the coffers of the tube\u2019s parent organisation. Transport for London, chaired by Mayor Sadiq Khan, needed a 1.6 billion pound government bailout back in May. That prompted parallel funding reviews to be launched this week by Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s government and Khan.  There\u2019s a clear opportunity to improve. TfL is one of the few major transport networks in Europe that receives no funding for its operations from the central government. If fares dip, and it can\u2019t borrow to cover the gap, bailouts are likely. It would be simpler for the state to formalise a financial backstop to allow investment to be maintained and ensure trains are clean post-pandemic. Fares may be lower for some time given emptier trains and buses. The state, which has the lowest cost of funding, is the best placed to pick up the bill.

Second-quarter unit revenue will drop by 1 percent to 3 percent, the carrier said in its quarterly earnings report, with 1 to 2 percentage points attributed to a decrease in bookings following the engine explosion. The loss in bookings will shave between $50 million and $100 million, Southwest said.  The airline attributed some of the ticket sales slump to the advertising it had pulled immediately following the incident, but said it expects to reintroduce advertising and promotions this week as it gears up to battle a price war with rivals.  Shares of the Dallas-based carrier recouped some of their earlier steep losses and were last down 1.18 percent. They have fallen 18.52 percent so far this year.  Southwest posted first-quarter profit of $438 million, excluding special items, up from $372 million a year earlier. It earned 75 cents per share, topping the Wall Street consensus projection of 74 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Unit costs rose modestly by 0.1 percent year over year. In the current quarter, Southwest expects a 1 percent to 2 percent increase in unit costs, excluding fuel and some items.  \u2018SOMBER TIME\u2019  Southwest has been under intense scrutiny in the days since an engine on one of its Boeing 737 jets blew apart during a flight last Tuesday, killing one of 149 people aboard and raising concerns about the safety of similar engines.  \u201cIt remains a somber time for the Southwest Family following the Flight 1380 accident,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said in a statement. \u201cWe continue to cooperate with the National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s thorough investigation to understand the cause of the accident.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: A traveler checks her baggage at the Southwest Airlines terminal at LAX airport in Los Angeles, California, U.S., January 24, 2017. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  The incident marked the first fatality on a U.S. commercial passenger airline since 2009.  Over the next month Southwest will be inspecting other CFM56-7B engines, the model involved in last week\u2019s accident. The engine is manufactured by CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and France\u2019s Safran.  It was not immediately known how much Southwest will record in expenses related to the engine blowout over the next several months.  The carrier included a preliminary estimate in its second-quarter unit cost outlook of an increase of 1 percent to 2 percent, also including some pressure from employee wage and benefit increases.  Southwest has sent $5,000 checks to passengers of the April 17 flight and canceled dozens of other flights in an effort to voluntarily ramp up engine inspections. [nL1N1S1012]  As of Thursday, Southwest CEO Kelly said in an interview with CNBC, the airline had inspected more than 80 percent of its fleet. Kelly said the airline plans to conclude inspections by the end of May.  Before last week\u2019s episode, Southwest said it had inspected about 17,000 of its engine fan blades, and has since completed inspections of about 8,500 more.  COMPETING AGGRESSIVELY  Southwest's quarterly results reflect the impact of a fierce pricing battle it is embroiled in with rival U.S. carrier United Airlines UAL.N over primary control of some key hubs.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been competing very aggressively and we will continue to do that,\u201d Southwest President Tom Nealon said on the carrier\u2019s first-quarter earnings call.  \u201cWe are well prepared to compete.

Flightaware.com, a website that tracks aviation cancellations, said Southwest canceled 129 flights on Monday, or 3 percent of its total flights, and delayed 468 other flights, or 11 percent. By contrast, other major U.S. carriers had each canceled four or fewer flights on Monday, the website said.  Southwest said the cancellations were the result of the company\u2019s announcement last Tuesday that it would begin voluntarily stepping up inspections of some CFM56-7B engines over the next 30 days. The airline said on Sunday it canceled about 40 flights.  It said on Monday it anticipated \u201cminimal delays or cancellations each day due to the inspections.\u201d  The company added it \u201cwill continue our work to minimize flight disruptions by performing inspections overnight while aircraft are not flying, and utilizing spare aircraft, when available.\u201d  The Federal Aviation Administration and European regulators ordered emergency inspections within 20 days of nearly 700 aircraft engines similar to the one involved in the fatal Southwest engine blowout.  Southwest said the cancellations were not a result of the emergency directive.  The engine explosion on Southwest flight 1380 on Tuesday was caused by a fan blade that broke off, the FAA said. The blast shattered a window, killing a passenger, in the first U.S. airline passenger fatality since 2009.  Southwest has declined to answer questions about its CFM56-7B inspection program, including how many engines were inspected before the accident, and if the engine that failed had been inspected and if the new inspections turned up any problems.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  The planes are part of 88 pre-owned Boeing BA.N 737 aircraft Southwest bought between 2013 and 2017 from 16 foreign carriers. The speedier checks come after inspections of 39 used planes turned up previously undisclosed repairs and incorrectly completed fixes. Southwest used multiple contractors to conduct the reviews of the planes' maintenance records when they bought the planes.  \u201cWe have a plan in place to inspect the 47 remaining aircraft, nine of which are currently in heavy checks, no later than January 31, 2020 \u2013 five months earlier than the original FAA accepted completion date of July 1,\u201d Southwest said in a statement on Monday.  Southwest said its inspections to date \u201cdid not stem from any suspected safety concerns with the aircraft.\u201d It added its \u201ccontinuous assessment of the ongoing inspections has revealed nothing to warrant the expedited timeline\u201d but will meet it nevertheless.  In 2018, Southwest agreed to conduct a complete physical inspection on each of these pre-owned aircraft over a two-year period after a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) safety inspector in May 2018 discovered discrepancies in records for some of 88 aircraft.  Since then, Southwest said it has completed the nose-to-tail inspection of 41 aircraft without any findings that suggested an \u201cadverse impact on continued safe operation.\u201d  An Oct. 24 memo from H. Clayton Foushee, director of the FAA Audit and Evaluation Office, made public on Monday said the Southwest inspections turned up at least 30 previously unknown repairs and 42 major repairs that were found \u201cnot to meet FAA airworthiness requirements.\u201d Some required \u201cimmediate corrective action to bring the aircraft back into compliance.\u201d  The memo added \u201cthe data collected to date would indicate that a majority of\u201d the planes to be inspected do not meet FAA airworthiness requirements.  The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee noted on Monday that the 2018 discovery prompted a full records review by Southwest Airlines of all 88 aircraft that found 360 major repairs previously unknown to the airline because they were not disclosed in the contractors\u2019 initial review.  Foushee\u2019s memo said Southwest grounded 34 planes in November 2018 for inspections. The committee said as a result some planes were grounded \u201cfor immediate maintenance to bring them into regulatory compliance as a result of these newly discovered prior major repairs.\u201d  The FAA then sent an Oct. 29 letter to Southwest seeking additional information about the uninspected planes and questioned whether they suffered specific damage items.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The No. 4 U.S. carrier is the biggest user of the Boeing Co aircraft that were grounded worldwide in March following two fatal crashes on other airlines.  Southwest\u2019s 34 737 MAX aircraft represent less than 5 percent of daily flights on its fleet of 753 aircraft, but the grounding has forced the cancellation of thousands of flights and weighed on costs.  The Dallas-based carrier said it lost more than $200 million in revenue during the first quarter after canceling more than 10,000 flights because of the worldwide MAX grounding, partial U.S. government shutdown, winter storms and maintenance disruptions.  Southwest has taken the MAX out of its flying schedule through Aug. 5 as it waits for Boeing to submit a software fix and new training guidelines to global regulators for review.  The timeline and eventual cost of getting the MAX back into service is a \u201cprominent wild card\u201d for Southwest, JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker said, given the possibility of international regulators disagreeing about new training requirements, which could be expensive.  Southwest said it was talking to customers to understand how they feel about the MAX following the crashes. While some passengers may be intimidated to fly for a short period of time, executives said the airline\u2019s brand and operations remained intact.  The low-cost carrier, which launched service to Hawaii in March, expects closely watched unit revenue to grow by 5.5 percent to 5.7 percent year-on-year in the second quarter. It reported only 2.7 percent growth in the first-quarter.  Its shares were up 0.3 percent at $53.14.  Southwest reported first-quarter net profit of $387 million, or 70 cents per share, compared with $463 million, or 79 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.  That beat Wall Street\u2019s average estimate of 61 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Analysts cut their estimates sharply in late March after the MAX grounding.  Total operating revenue rose 4 percent to $5.15 billion.  FLEET CHANGES  Southwest, which currently uses only Boeing narrowbody aircraft, suggested on Thursday that it may consider mixing up its fleet in the future, but for now plans to continue growing with the 737 MAX.  \u201cWe have no plan to do anything other than grow our fleet with the MAX. Will that be the case in the perpetuity? I\u2019m not prepared to say that,\u201d Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly said on a conference call.  Southwest has 249 firm orders for the 737 MAX and an option for 115 more through 2026, in addition to lease agreements for another 19. Kelly said he would like to eventually use the longer-range, fuel-efficient jets for Hawaii routes.  It is not the first time Southwest has hinted about future fleet changes, which could benefit Boeing\u2019s European rival Airbus. Such a decision would mean abandoning Southwest\u2019s long-held practice of flying only one type of jet, which reduces maintenance and pilot training costs.  The company\u2019s costs are already under scrutiny by analysts. Unit costs, or total operating expenses per available seat mile, rose 6.5 percent on an adjusted basis in the first quarter and are expected to increase by 10.5 percent to 12.5 percent year-on-year in the second quarter, it said.","38":"FILE PHOTO: A Southwest Airlines jet waits on the tarmac at Denver International Airport in Denver January 22, 2014.

The FAA said late Thursday in a statement that after \u201clearning of concerns about how certain aircraft were added to Southwest Airlines\u2019 fleet, the agency took comprehensive action. In addition to actions aimed at ensuring the safety of the aircraft, the FAA appointed a new leadership team\u201d at the FAA office that oversees Southwest.  The report said also that in 2019, a Southwest jet smashed both wingtips on a runway while repeatedly trying to land amid gale-force winds.  Southwest said Thursday that all of the 88 Boeing BA.N 737 used planes cited in the inspector general's report \"have either completed a comprehensive physical inspection, from nose to tail, or are currently in the inspection phase.\"  Southwest said it \u201chas completed a thorough review of 75 aircraft and we are in the process of inspecting the remaining 13 aircraft which are currently in heavy checks.\u201d  Southwest said some repairs by prior owners \u201chad been performed but not properly classified by the previous owners due to differences in language and repair criteria.\u201d The FAA said in November that inspections of 39 used planes turned up previously undisclosed repairs and incorrectly completed fixes.

It\u2019s the only thing we\u2019re dealing with,\u201d Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly told investors after taking a $175 million hit to operating income in the second quarter from the MAX grounding.  \u201cEverything else is rock solid,\u201d Kelly said, pointing to rising revenues and cost management, excluding costs related to roughly 150 daily flight cancellations as the airline manages its operations with a slimmer fleet.  Those costs are set to rise in the second half of the year, the airline said.  Southwest and American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O are the two largest U.S. MAX operators, with 34 and 24 jets respectively and dozens more on order. Carriers that rushed to buy Boeing's fuel-efficient jets to open new and longer routes have been reeling from a global grounding in March that followed two fatal crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia.  American, the No. 1 U.S. airline, said it expected the grounding to hit its 2019 pre-tax earnings by about $400 million, about $50 million more than it had previously forecast.  The timing of the MAX\u2019s return to service is still uncertain.  The acting administrator for the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which must approve Boeing\u2019s software fixes and new pilot training before the MAX can fly again, said on Thursday the timeline would be driven by one criteria: safety.  Based on guidance from Boeing, Southwest extended MAX-related cancellations until Jan. 5, 2020, saying it will need one to two months following regulatory approval to train pilots and prepare the jets for fresh commercial service.  It had previously removed the MAX jets from its flying schedule through early November, a timeline that American maintained on Thursday, despite skepticism by analysts.  Shares in American were down about 4.7% on Thursday while Southwest gained 1.6%, recovering from opening losses.  SCRAMBLING TO GROW  Lacking planes, Southwest said it was freezing new pilot hires and upgrades and ceasing service from underperforming Newark, where it had up to 20 daily departures, to consolidate its New York City service at nearby LaGuardia in early November.  However, the airline is resuming its growth plans in California and Hawaii next month, Kelly said. The airline cannot afford competitively to wait any longer, he said.  The low-cost carrier launched Hawaii flights this year. To help service that expansion, it is delaying the retirement of seven 737-700 aircraft.  Still, Southwest said its flying capacity will now fall by as much as 2% this year, a reversal from its earlier forecast of 5% growth. American\u2019s capacity will still grow in 2019, the airline said, but at a slower rate than originally planned.  Both Southwest and American said they have held discussions with Boeing about MAX-related damages but have not reached any conclusions.  Boeing, which posted its largest-ever quarterly loss on Wednesday and warned it may have to halt 737 MAX production, has taken a $4.9 billion charge linked to customer compensation.  FEWER SEATS, HIGHER REVENUES  With fewer planes flying in a strong domestic air travel market, airlines have been able to charge more for seats, leading to stronger rises in unit revenues, based on per available seat mile, for American and Southwest as well as its main rivals.  That trend is expected to continue into the third quarter  American\u2019s total operating revenue rose 3% to $11.96 billion in the second quarter from a year earlier, while Southwest\u2019s grew 2.9% to $5.9 billion, a quarterly record for both.  American said it was extending the lifespan of some of its other 737 models as well as some 757s and A320s. But aside from MAX woes, American is also dealing with about a dozen daily cancellations it attributes to work slowdowns by its two main mechanics unions, which need new contracts.  The unions have denied an intentional slowdown and the issue is being disputed in court, though American Chief Executive Doug Parker said he was determined to get a labor contract in place.","43":"FILE PHOTO: An aerial photo shows Boeing 737 MAX airplanes parked on the tarmac at the Boeing Factory in Renton, Washington, U.S. March 21, 2019.

Last week, Boeing said that it would take until at least September to solve 737 MAX software issues - later than airlines had been expecting - after U.S. aviation regulators uncovered a new problem during simulator sessions.  \u201cI\u2019m sure this will cause us to have to take the MAX out of the schedule beyond Oct. 1,\u201d Kelly said in an internal update, adding that the company would also see \u201cwhat other modifications we might need to make our plans for this year because it\u2019s obviously extending well beyond what I had hoped.\u201d  Kelly did not elaborate on the possible modifications. So far, the Texas-based airline has tried to substitute its MAX routes with spare aircraft but has still been forced to cancel about 115 daily flights.

Boeing Co's BA.N 737 MAX was banned in March after two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Last week, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said it would not approve the aircraft's return to service before 2020, prompting Boeing to freeze 737 production for the first time in two decades.  The production halt itself does not immediately impact airlines but the deepening crisis at Boeing is crimping the growth plans of top customers like Southwest, which are still awaiting deliveries of hundreds of 737 MAX planes that have already been built.  The low-cost carrier said on Tuesday it was removing roughly 300 weekday flights from its total peak-day schedule of more than 4,000 daily flights through April 13, nearly double the amount it had canceled through March 6.  Southwest, the world\u2019s largest Boeing 737 MAX operator, had 34 MAX planes in its fleet when they were grounded in March and was hoping to take delivery of up to 41 more jets by early next year, allowing it to restore frequencies and routes it has been forced to cancel due to a shortage of aircraft.  Among the other U.S. 737 MAX carriers, American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O last week extended its 737 MAX cancellations through April 6, while United Airlines Holdings Inc UAL.O is scheduling without the plane until early March.

Kelly said the airline is debating between the Boeing 737 MAX-7, which has yet to come out and be certified, or European planemaker Airbus' AIR.PA A220s, which would mean a shift away from its all-Boeing fleet for the first time.

Southwest is the largest operator of the MAX with 34 jetliners in its fleet when the aircraft was grounded worldwide following two fatal crashes that together killed 346 people.  The lawsuit, filed in the District Court of Dallas County, Texas, alleges that Boeing \u201cabandoned sound design and engineering practices, withheld safety critical information from regulators and deliberately misled its customers, pilots and the public about the true scope of design changes to the 737 MAX.\u201d  Boeing spokesman Chaz Bickers said: \u201cWhile we value our long relationship with SWAPA, we believe this lawsuit is meritless and will vigorously defend against it.\u201d  The planemaker will continue to work with Southwest and its pilots on efforts to safely return the MAX to service, he said.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Southwest and American, the two largest U.S. operators of the aircraft, have had to scale back growth plans and are together canceling more than 300 flights a day, taking a hit to profits as they manage slimmer fleets without the 737 MAX.  Southwest, which has bet its entire growth strategy on Boeing\u2019s newest single-aisle aircraft, had previously canceled all its 737 MAX flights until Feb. 8 and now expects a return to service on March 6, though it warned that the timeline could get pushed back again.  Boeing Co is facing increasing hurdles in obtaining approval to return the plane to service before the end of this year as it has targeted.  American said it planned to resume commercial flights on the 737 MAX on March 5, and expects to run test flights for American team members and invited guests before that date, once the aircraft is certified.  United Airlines, the other U.S. 737 MAX operator, had thus far canceled flights into January, although it may yet have to extend that time frame. Reuters reported this week that U.S. and European regulators will need to return to a Rockwell Collins facility in Iowa to complete an audit of Boeing\u2019s software documentation after regulators found gaps and substandard documents. Boeing has confirmed it must submit revised documentation.  That has thrown into question when Boeing would be able to complete a certification test flight. The Federal Aviation Administration has said it would not unground the planes until 30 days after that flight occurs.  The 737 MAX, Boeing\u2019s best-selling plane, has been grounded since March after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people.  Two U.S. officials told Reuters it is extremely unlikely - if not impossible - that Boeing will be able to win approval to return flights to service before the end of December.  Just two days ago, American Chief Executive Doug Parker said he was hopeful that the aircraft would \u201cget certified in the near future.\u201d  RISING COST  American has estimated that the 737 MAX grounding has cut 2019 earnings by $540 million, while Southwest estimated the total hit to its earnings between January and September at $435 million.  That toll will only rise the longer the MAX remains parked. Boeing is discussing compensation with airlines but no agreement has been reached.  Southwest had 34 MAX jets at the time of the March 13 grounding and was expecting delivery of another 41 jets this year. It said on Friday it still hopes to receive seven MAX deliveries in the current quarter, with the remaining shifting into 2020.  But without clarity on the MAX timeline, Southwest said it could not update a previous forecast for first-quarter capacity to grow between 2% and 3%.","60":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Eight passengers have sued Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N over a catastrophic engine blowout in April that killed a passenger and injured several others.

Earnings for the company at Newark airport in New Jersey came in below expectations.  The airline had previously removed the MAX jets from its flying schedule through early November.  Shares in Southwest sank about 5% in premarket trading.  Boeing Co's BA.N top-selling jet was grounded worldwide in March following two fatal crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia that killed 346 people within a span of five months. U.S. airlines are cancelling thousands of flights every month as they operate with slimmer fleets.  The U.S. airline said it took a $175 million hit to its operating income in the quarter from the MAX grounding, which pushed unit costs 7.5% higher, with additional cost pressure seen in the second half of 2019.  Still, customer demand remained strong and the company is pushing ahead with a Hawaii expansion next month and plans to add more Mexico service early next year.  Total operating revenue rose 2.9% to $5.9 billion in the quarter, helped by its Rapid Rewards Loyalty program, optional boarding fees and the ability to charge more for seats given reduced sector capacity.  Closely watched unit revenue, based on per available seat mile, rose 6.8% in the quarter and Southwest said it expects between 3% and 5% growth in the third quarter.  However, it said overall capacity will now decrease between 1% and 2% in 2019 due to the MAX groundings, compared with its earlier forecast of nearly 5% growth.  Based on Boeing\u2019s most recent guidance, Southwest said it is assuming regulatory approval for the MAX in the fourth quarter and will need one to two months to prepare the grounded jets for commercial service.

REUTERS\/Jim Young  Kelleher set up Southwest with Rollin King more than 50 years ago, with the airline making its first flight in June 1971. King died in 2014, aged 83.  Dallas-based Southwest is known for its quirky culture, closely connected with Kelleher\u2019s maverick image, as well as its fast growth from a regional carrier into one of the biggest in the United States.  The airline flew short flights known as point-to-point, rather than the hub-and-spoke model of its bigger rivals, and used a single model of aircraft, Boeing Co\u2019s 737, to cut complexity and cost.  Kelleher was \u201cGrand Master Yoda of low fares airlines,\u201d the chief executive of Europe\u2019s largest low-cost carrier Ryanair said in a Twitter post on Friday.  \u201cHe was the leader, the visionary and the teacher: without Herb there would be no Ryanair and no low fares airlines anywhere,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Leary, who spearheaded the transformation of European air travel after a visit to Southwest in 1992.  Southwest\u2019s cabin crews have become known for their good humor \u2013 a legacy of Kelleher, memorialized in a \u201claugh button\u201d that visitors could press inside the company\u2019s headquarters to hear his famous cackle.  Kelleher won the affection of customers and employees with low fares, good wages and his own high spirits. He sought to instill a sense of fun among employees, sometimes showing up in costume or helping unload baggage.  \u201cA company is stronger if it is bound by love rather than by fear,\u201d he was once quoted as saying.

John Plueger, chief executive of Air Lease Corp, said on Thursday that when he first met Kelleher more than 30 years ago, Kelleher was about to deliver a speech at a New York hotel. \u201cThe manager asked that he refrain from smoking. Herb looked up, smiled, and said: \u2018No smokey, No talkey.\u2019\u201d  Kelleher was a formidable industry competitor as well.  \u201cThere aren\u2019t a whole lot of individuals who you can point to that single-handedly contributed to building a demonstrable portion of the modern economy.

Kelleher was long a towering figure in the U.S. airline industry along with Bob Crandall, his rival at American Airlines and polar opposite in style. The two built different business models and competed fiercely but with mutual respect.  \u201cIt was very hot competition and I like to win,\u201d Kelleher told NPR in a 2016 podcast.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Shares rose 2% TO $54.25 in premarket trading.  Southwest, the world\u2019s largest 737 MAX operator, said it took a $210-million hit to operating income in the quarter from the ongoing MAX safety ban, which followed two deadly crashes on Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines within five months.  Without the MAX, Southwest has fewer seats to sell, pushing up fares when planes are flying near capacity and driving the closely-watched metric of revenues per available seat mile, or unit revenues.  Unit revenue grew 4.2% in the quarter ended Sept. 30, with average fares up 1.7%.  Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said he expects unit revenue growth in the fourth quarter as well, based on current bookings and trends in customer demand, but warned that damages from the MAX groundings would continue to rise into 2020.  Airlines have been negotiating compensation with Boeing but Southwest said no settlement has yet been reached and the company did not include any settlement amounts in quarterly results.  Southwest said it would save some money on the delay in deliveries of more MAX jets, which remain frozen during the grounding, cutting its projected 2019 capital expenditure to between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion from a prior range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion.  That was based on the assumption that Boeing will meet its target of gaining regulatory approval for a MAX return to service in the fourth quarter.  Unit costs excluding fuel and profit-sharing expenses rose 7.6 percent and are expected to grow between 4 percent and 6 percent in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the MAX.  \u201cThe non-fuel unit cost outlook is better than previously forecast as the company is executing well despite the MAX grounding,\u201d Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a note.  Southwest has said it will need one to two months after 737 MAX regulatory approval to ready its 34 jets for flight and retrain its pilots. As of now it is scheduling without the MAX until Feb. 8.

The No.4 U.S. airline has canceled thousands of flights since the 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March following two fatal crashes, in addition to cancellations due to bad weather and unscheduled maintenance disruptions as it worked out a new labor contract with its mechanics union.  The low-cost carrier has removed the fuel-efficient, longer-range MAX from its flying schedule through Aug. 5 as it waits for Boeing Co to submit a software fix and new training guidelines to global regulators for review.  \u201cFlight cancellations are expected to drive unit cost pressure for the duration of the MAX groundings,\u201d Southwest Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said.

The inspector general\u2019s office said in a memo it is opening a new review after \u201crecent events have raised concerns about FAA\u2019s safety oversight, particularly for Southwest Airlines.\u201d  The inspector general said \u201cour objective is to assess FAA\u2019s oversight of Southwest Airlines\u2019 systems for managing risk.\u201d The office will write a report after it completes the review and may make recommendations.  A Southwest Boeing 737 engine failed in midair on April 17 after it lost a fan blade, killing one passenger. Fragments of the fan blade struck the fuselage, prompting an emergency landing in Philadelphia.  In August 2016, a Southwest flight safely made an emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida, after a fan blade separated from the same type of engine and debris ripped a hole above the left wing.  The inspector general cited the 2016 flight \u201cbut it is unclear what actions the carrier took to manage the risk to prevent a future failure.\u201d  The FAA, which oversees U.S. civil aviation, said on Thursday it welcomes the inspector general\u2019s \u201cexamination of the FAA\u2019s oversight of Southwest Airlines.\u201d  The FAA said its oversight system is designed \u201cto identify potential risks before they become serious problems and ensure that corrective action is taken.\u201d  Southwest said it has \u201ca very transparent and professional relationship with\u201d the FAA and welcomes \u201cany additional enhancements or oversights\u201d into its safety management system.  The inspector general said it recently received a complaint \u201cregarding a number of operational issues at Southwest Airlines, such as alleged pilot training deficiencies, which raise concerns about FAA\u2019s oversight of the carrier.\u201d  In May, the FAA said federal investigators were assigned last year to monitor Southwest maintenance operations, after whistleblower complaints of mistreatment of mechanics raised concerns.  The agency said it found no rule violations and that the assignment of additional inspectors was standard practice to preclude any deterioration in maintenance.  On Monday, the inspector general launched a separate audit of FAA oversight of aircraft evacuation procedures. The FAA requires an aircraft to be fully evacuated in 90 seconds or less.  The inspector general said industry tests for certifying new aircraft have not been significantly updated since 1990, noting airlines have added seats and shrunk the space between seats, which could change evacuation times.","96":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the Southwest Airlines Co pilot union Wednesday sharply criticized Boeing Co and questioned whether the manufacturer was trying to speed up the timeline for the 737 MAX\u2019s return to service.

Southwest Airlines spokeswoman Brandy King said the airline is \u201cconfident in the work being done to return the MAX to service and continue to await additional guidance from Boeing and the FAA regarding timing and next steps.\u201d  On Monday, Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe told Reuters that \u201cwe expect the Max to be certified, airworthiness directive issued, ungrounded in mid-December.\u201d He added that the company expects \u201cpilot training requirements to be approved in January.\u201d  Boeing noted that the \u201cFAA and other regulatory authorities will ultimately determine return to service.\u201d  Two federal officials told Reuters this week that Boeing\u2019s timetable is aggressive and far from certain, citing hurdles yet to be cleared.  Boeing still must complete an audit of its software documentation before it can schedule a key certification test flight.  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) chief Steve Dickson on Tuesday said the agency was not \u201cdelegating\u201d anything to Boeing in its review and offered no ungrounding timetable, saying it \u201cwill be based solely on our assessment of the sufficiency of Boeing\u2019s proposed software updates and pilot training.\u201d  On Friday, Southwest and American Airlines extended Boeing 737 MAX cancellations until early March, just shy of the one-year anniversary of an Ethiopian Airlines crash that led to a worldwide grounding.

The labor dispute, one of the biggest to hit a top-four U.S. airline in more than a decade, has escalated with Southwest\u2019s daily out-of-service aircraft doubling, forcing the carrier to cancel hundreds of flights since Feb. 15.

Reuters obtained a copy of the email late Friday.  Kelly said the mechanics deserve a new contract and pointed out that the deal the mechanics voted down last year would have made those workers the highest paid in the industry. He said current talks offer the opportunity to offer even higher pay with no impact on job security \u201cin exchange for more supplier flexibility.\u201d  Southwest already outsources the majority of heavy maintenance work, such as scheduled engine repairs, to external suppliers, but wants the option to send more scheduled maintenance abroad in order to fund compensation increases.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The global MAX grounding, which followed two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, has meant that airlines have fewer seats to sell, even though costs remain.  But because planes are flying near capacity, airlines can charge more for available seats, driving up the closely-watched metric of revenues per available seat mile, or unit revenues.  Southwest last week joined larger rival American Airlines in extending its removal of the MAX planes from its schedules until the start of September.  The low-cost carrier said here in a regulatory filing it now expects second quarter unit revenues to increase in the 6.5% to 7.5% range compared with its previous forecast of 5.5% to 7.5%.  It sees unit costs, excluding fuel and profitsharing expenses, rising 11.5% to 12.5% versus previous guidance for 10.5% to 12.5%.

With more seats and low fuel costs, airlines may struggle to raise fares, she said.  Southwest continues to expect second quarter fuel costs in the range of $2.10 to $2.20 per gallon, but said its fuel efficiency will decline more than expected due to the absence of its most fuel-efficient aircraft, the MAX.

Dallas-based Southwest said unit costs excluding fuel and profit-sharing expenses are seen spiking between 6% and 8% in the current quarter as the company manages an operation built around more flights than it is now able to operate due to fleet constraints.  \u201cThe outlook continues to be negatively impacted by the grounding of the MAX,\u201d Cowen analyst Helane Becker said.

Net income declined 21% to $514 million, or $0.98 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $654 million, or $1.17 per share, a year earlier.  The profit was below a Wall Street consensus forecast for $1.09 per share, mainly because Southwest said it treated a $124 million profit-sharing payment to employees that stemmed from a partial compensation agreement with Boeing last month as an operating expense while most analysts treated it as a one-time item.  \u201cI am pleased with the Boeing agreement for 2019. But, we continue to incur financial damages in 2020, and we will continue discussions with Boeing regarding further compensation,\u201d CEO Gary Kelly said.

Total operating revenue rose 0.4% to $5.7 billion in the quarter, sustained by healthy travel demand, which it sees continuing in the first quarter, even as the company had to scale back its growth strategy due to the lack of airplanes.  Seat capacity fell 1.6% in 2019 from a year earlier versus an original plan to grow capacity by nearly 5%.  The airline had 34 MAX jets in its fleet at the time of the grounding and dozens more on order.  With the jets grounded, Southwest expects capacity to fall between 1.5% and 2.5% in the first quarter. It did not make a full-year estimate given continued MAX uncertainty.  Boeing said on Tuesday it does not expect to win approval for the 737 MAX to fly again until mid-year as regulators continue to scrutinize software and flight control updates and debate new pilot training requirements.  Based on that guidance, Southwest plans to take delivery of 27 MAX jets in 2020, though it warned the number could change and said it continues to plan for multiple return-to-service scenarios.

Next year Southwest said it will restrict capacity growth to under 5 percent, including a new Hawaii route.

But Southwest, whose mandate goes into effect July 27, will no longer allow medical or disability exemptions, saying that if someone is unable to wear a face covering for any reason, it \u201cregrets that we will be unable to transport the individual.\u201d  Passengers can remove their coverings to eat, drink or take medicine, but Southwest said it expects those instances \u201cto be very brief.\u201d  American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O said its order, effective July 29, would require that all passengers over the age of 2 wear face coverings at airports and on board.  The orders come as more governors are requiring residents to wear masks at nearly all times outside their homes.  United\u2019s chief executive, Scott Kirby, told investors Wednesday that coronavirus-hit demand could improve thanks to lessons learned about preventing the spread of COVID-19, including wearing masks.  Airlines, which are grappling with demand that has been crushed by the coronavirus pandemic, say hospital-grade air filtration systems coupled with face masks and better cleaning make air travel safe.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Southwest also said it is rolling out a thermal screening trial at its homebase airport, Dallas Love Field, to respond to the pandemic.  Major U.S. airlines have been unsuccessful to date in convincing the Trump administration to back temperature testing for airline passengers.

Southwest\u2019s new service will include inner-island travel in direct competition to Hawaiian Airlines, as well as a combination of flights from Oakland, Sacramento, San Diego and San Jose to four destinations in Hawaii.  Southwest, already a go-to airline for many travelers within California with over 60-percent market share, has been trying to expand its West Coast leisure portfolio under a growth drive that has also included new flights to Mexico.  \u201cHawaii allows us to give more leisure options to our customers on the West Coast, which has been heavy on the business side,\u201d Andrew Watterson, chief revenue officer for Southwest, said in a phone interview.  That contrasts with Southwest\u2019s portfolio on the East Coast of the United States, where it has built a reputation as a low-cost carrier for leisure destinations in Florida from cities in the U.S. Northeast.  The Hawaii launch comes later than Southwest had hoped after a partial U.S. government shutdown earlier in the year delayed the certification process needed for new over-ocean flights.  As a result, the Dallas-based carrier missed a key booking window for travel to the Hawaiian islands, which Watterson said passengers tend to reserve months in advance, rather than days or weeks.  This means Southwest has had to offer lower-than-average introductory fares through mid-June to stimulate passenger traffic.  \u201cAfter that we\u2019ll have the traditional Southwest low fares in the subsequent booking period,\u201d Watterson said.  While the government over-water certification opens the door for other long-haul flights for Southwest, Watterson said the plan is to focus on Hawaii for the time being, noting that there is no extra aircraft right now to service new routes.  Southwest will begin flying to Hawaii with its Boeing 737-800 NG planes and plans to switch to 737-MAX 8 aircraft later this year, he said.

A trade association warned that without action airlines could run out of money by year-end - and even sooner if credit card companies started withholding payments. Without action soon, airlines and others in the sector could furlough tens of thousands of workers.  Airlines for America, the trade group representing American Airlines AAL.O, United Airlines Inc UAL.O, Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N, Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N and others, said the industry needs $25 billion in grants, $25 billion in loans and significant tax relief to survive. They also seek tax relief that could be worth tens of billions of dollars through the end of at least 2021.  They also seek a package of $8 billion, equally divided in grants and loans for cargo carriers. Airports are seeking at least $10 billion in emergency government assistance, sources told Reuters.  Boeing Co BA.N is also seeking short-term assistance, for itself, as well as plane suppliers and for the entire aviation sector, a person briefed on the matter said, saying the company is confident Americans will want to travel again and is in talks with the White House and U.S. lawmakers. It is not clear how much Boeing is seeking. Boeing declined to comment.  \u201cWe have to back the airlines - it\u2019s not their fault,\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump said, saying he has told the airlines he will assist them but did not endorse a specific figure. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be backstopping the airlines. We\u2019re going to be helping them very much.\u201d  The pain was felt around the globe, with European carriers making unprecedented cuts to flights, costs and staffing while stepping up calls for emergency aid.

It requires urgent action,\u201d said Nicholas Calio, president of the airline group. The airlines\u2019 proposal would see them get funds within 15 days of approval.  U.S. carriers have slashed flights and last week met with the White House to sound the alarm for urgent action.

Bloomberg reported the talks earlier.  Separately, Amtrak and U.S. airports are also in talks about receiving urgent government assistance. Amtrak and its state rail partners are seeking $1 billion as it slashes trains and warned it could see losses of at least hundreds of millions of dollars this year.  The companies said the grants would compensate them for reduced liquidity - net of financing - for all of 2020 attributable to the coronavirus outbreak.  Air Line Pilots Association President Joe DePete said Monday \u201cany economic relief package must contain strong labor protections for the airline employees who have\u2014or will\u2014suffer financial harm.\u201d  Senator Ed Markey, a Democrat, said any airline bailout \u201cmust have some major strings attached \u2013 including new rules to prohibit consumer abuses like unfair change and cancellation fees; protections for front-line workers like flight attendants, pilots, and airport workers.\u201d He also called for requiring \u201cdevelopment of long-term strategies and targets to reduce the carbon footprint of the airline industry.\u201d  Two people briefed on the matter said the chief executives of all of Airlines for Americas' members signed off on the request, including United, Atlas Air AAWW.O, Delta, American, Hawaiian Airlines HA.O, Southwest and JetBlue Airways Corp JBLU.O.  Southwest said Monday it had secured a new $1 billion line of credit and withdrawing its previous 2020 financial guidance. Southwest said its planes were flying only half full. It will reduce capacity by at least 20% from April 14 through June 5.  United said Sunday in the first two weeks of March it had 1 million fewer passengers and is currently projecting revenue in March will be $1.5 billion lower than last March.

The lawsuit was filed on Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  Dallas-based Southwest has been under intense scrutiny in the days since a CFM56-7B engine on one of its Boeing 737-700 jets blew apart during an April 17 flight, shattering a plane window and flinging shrapnel.  Passenger Jennifer Riordan, one of 149 people aboard, was killed. The incident has raised concerns about the safety of similar engines.  Regulators at the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are investigating.  \u201cOur focus remains on working with the NTSB to support their investigation,\u201d Southwest said on Friday. \u201cWe can\u2019t comment on any pending litigation. The safety and security of our employees and customers is our highest priority at all times.\u201d  Also named in the Thursday suit are France\u2019s Safran S.A., General Electric Aviation and CFM International, the manufacturers behind the engine that broke apart. CFM is a transatlantic joint-venture co-owned by GE and Safran.  The suit claims that Southwest and the engine makers had \u201cplaced profits and business\u201d over passenger safety and continued to operate the engine \u201ceven when there was confirmation that an unsafe condition existed.\u201d  A Southwest flight in August 2016 with the same type of CFM56-7B engine made an emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida, after a fan blade separated and debris ripped a hole above the left wing.  After the incident, European regulators gave airlines nine months to check the engines. U.S. regulators were still were considering what to do after proposing some checks.  \u201cDespite knowing of the dangerous condition of the subject aircraft\u2019s engine, the defendants risked the lives of more than a hundred innocent passengers,\u201d including Chavez, the filing reads.  A representative for GE did not return a request for comment. Safran could not immediately be reached.  The incident marked the first fatality on a U.S. commercial passenger airline since 2009.

A U.S. NTSB investigator is on scene examining damage to the engine of the Southwest Airlines plane in this image released from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S., April 17, 2018. NTSB\/Handout via REUTERS  The new FAA rules come after an emergency directive issued last month by the agency and European regulators requiring 680 CFM56-7B engines worldwide be inspected within 20 days on Boeing 737 NG airplanes.  Another group of CFM56-7B engines will need to be inspected by August under the regulation, the FAA said, adding that it is requiring repeat inspections of engines as part of Tuesday\u2019s action.  The April 17 engine explosion on Southwest Airlines flight 1380 was caused by a fan blade that broke off, the FAA said. The blast shattered a window, killing a passenger who was partially sucked out of the plane window in the first U.S. passenger airline fatality since 2009.  The FAA said an \u201cunsafe condition exists that requires the immediate adoption\u201d of the rule without a chance for public comment. In a notice posted in the Federal Register, the agency said \u201cthe risk to the flying public justifies\u201d the quick adoption of the rule.  CFM, jointly owned by General Electric Co and France\u2019s Safran, produces the CFM56 engine in factories in the United States and Europe.  The emergency action last month by the FAA and the European Aviation Safety Agency required ultrasonic inspections on fan blades that have been used in more than 30,000 cycles - or in service for about 20 years - within 20 days. A cycle includes one take-off and landing.  The FAA announcement on Tuesday requires inspections by August of CFM engines with 20,000 cycles of use, and then regular inspections for fan blades every additional 3,000 cycles, or about every two years. European regulators on April 20 adopted the actions taken by the FAA on Tuesday.

In a conference call last week with analysts and reporters, Southwest Chief Operating Officer Michael Van de Ven described the extensive damage to the plane\u2019s engine and cowling - the smooth metal exterior that covers the engine\u2019s inner workings.  \u201cThe loss of a single blade inside the engine just shouldn\u2019t have caused such dramatic impact,\u201d Van de Ven said.  Metal fatigue, the degradation of a metal\u2019s structural integrity over repeated use, likely caused the fan blade to break apart, according to the NTSB.

American trimmed the top end of its adjusted 2019 forecast to $5.50 per share versus its previous forecast range of $4.50 to $6 per share and raised the estimated costs related to the MAX grounding to $540 million for the year from $400 million.  Southwest did not provide a full-year profit forecast but said it took a $210 million hit to operating income in the quarter from the MAX safety ban, bringing the nine-month total to an estimated $435 million.  Boeing, which has faced increasing concerns in the past week over how the MAX was developed and certified, has set aside $5.6 billion in part to cover potential payments to customers for MAX-related damages.  Southwest has based its low-cost business model on operating an all-Boeing 737 fleet, a strategy that Kelly has said could be reviewed in the future.

Last week, Southwest said it was requiring \u201call hands on deck\u201d to address maintenance items and said all employees would have to provide a doctor\u2019s note if they failed to show up for work.  In response, the union said Southwest\u2019s requirements imposed extra-contractual demands with a threat of termination for failing to comply, and asked for its contract to be respected.  \u201cWe are only asking that we be permitted to perform our job in accordance with federal law \u2013 nothing more and nothing less,\u201d the union said in a memo posted on its website.

The airline confirmed news reports from passengers it had sent the checks along with $1,000 travel vouchers. \u201cWe can confirm the communication and gesture are authentic and heartfelt,\u201d the company said in a brief statement on Friday.  The CFM56 jet engine on Southwest flight 1380 blew apart over Pennsylvania on Tuesday, about 20 minutes after the Dallas-bound flight left New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport with 149 people on board. The engine debris shattered a window on the Boeing 737 plane, killing a passenger - the first death in a U.S. airline accident since 2009. The plane made an emergency landing in Philadelphia.  The Federal Aviation Administration said late on Wednesday it was working to quickly finalize an airworthiness directive within the next two weeks that had been proposed in August 2017 after a similar engine failure in a Southwest plane in 2016, which it said would apply to 220 engines.  National Transportation Safety Board investigators on the scene were expected to wrap up their work in Philadelphia on Saturday, the agency said on Friday.  Southwest said after the incident that it was accelerating its existing engine inspection program \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d and expected to complete it over the next 30 days.  The company has declined to answer questions about the status of those inspections and whether the engine that failed had previously been inspected or whether the inspections have turned up any evidence of defects or metal fatigue.  The FAA order will require ultrasonic inspection within the next six months of the fan blades on all CFM56-7B engines that have accrued a certain number of takeoffs. Others more recently serviced will require inspections within 18 months, the FAA draft order said.

That contrasts with Southwest\u2019s portfolio on the East Coast of the United States, where it has built a reputation as a low-cost carrier for leisure destinations in Florida from cities in the U.S. Northeast.  The Hawaii launch comes later than Southwest had hoped after a partial U.S. government shutdown earlier in the year delayed the certification process needed for new over-ocean flights.  As a result, the Dallas-based carrier missed a key booking window for travel to the Hawaiian islands, which Watterson said passengers tend to reserve months in advance, rather than days or weeks.  This means Southwest will have to offer lower-than-average introductory fares through mid-June to stimulate passenger traffic.  \u201cAfter that we\u2019ll have the traditional Southwest low fares in the subsequent booking period,\u201d Watterson said.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  The letter warned that a \u201cbreakdown in the relationship\u201d between the airline and the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association \u201craises concerns about the ongoing effectiveness of the airline\u2019s safety management system.\u201d  The union did not immediately comment on the letter, which noted that the FAA is neutral on the labor dispute.  Southwest called the FAA letter \u201cnormal protocol\u201d for airlines in times of \u201csignificant change,\u201d such as labor unrest, and is \u201cdesigned to ensure continued safe operations during such times at a carrier.\u201d  \u201cWe appreciate the FAA\u2019s oversight and maintain our dedicated focus on assuring the highest level of compliance and safety at all times,\u201d spokeswoman Brandy King said in a statement.  Southwest and the union, which have been in contract negotiations since 2012, are locked in an escalating battle that last week saw the airline file a lawsuit asking a federal judge to intervene.  CEO Gary Kelly said earlier this week the dispute is costing Southwest millions of dollars in lost revenues a week as well as millions of dollars in costs related to flight cancellations and delays.  The union - which represents more than 2,400 Southwest mechanics - disparaged the comments as \u201ca way to distract the public from Southwest\u2019s own degrading safety standards.\u201d  An FAA spokesman told Reuters: \u201cAs a standard practice, we have increased oversight at this time.\u201d  The FAA letter, from the associate administrator for aviation safety, Ali Bahrami, said he wrote to \u201cemphasize the importance of ensuring cooperatively, in accordance with FAA standards, the highest level of safety in the airline\u2019s operations.\u201d  The FAA trusts the airline and union will work to ensure \u201cthat any judicial order that might result from the litigation does not constrain appropriate safety activities,\u201d it added.  Dallas-based Southwest, one of the largest domestic U.S. carriers, has said it is committed to operating a safe fleet and that every maintenance report is investigated.  An unprecedented number of out-of-service aircraft in recent weeks at four of Southwest\u2019s maintenance locations has forced the airline to delay or cancel hundreds of flights.","216":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co\u2019s mechanics union said on Tuesday its members had overwhelmingly voted to ratify a tentative contract agreement with the airline, ending seven years of labor negotiations fraught with legal disputes and flight disruptions.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The agreement, which brought to a close one of the most disruptive labor disputes to hit a top-four U.S. airline in more than a decade, came a day after rival U.S. carrier American Airlines Group Inc said it was filing a labor-related lawsuit against its mechanics.  Analysts have highlighted labor issues as a main concern for airlines this year, in addition to rising fuel costs and the grounding of Boeing MAX jets after two fatal crashes.  Mechanics at both American and Southwest have complained that the airlines are moving to outsource maintenance work that has traditionally been done in-house.  In a statement on its website, the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, which represents around 2,500 Southwest mechanics, said about 95 percent of its members had voted to accept a labor agreement that includes significant pay increases and headcount protections.  Southwest, which had been forced to cancel hundreds of flights earlier this year stemming from the mechanics dispute, welcomed the agreement.  \u201cOur mechanics will receive well-deserved pay increases, and the company will realize additional flexibilities necessary to compete in today\u2019s airline industry,\u201d Russell McCrady, vice president of labor relations, said in a statement.  AMERICAN AIRLINES MECHANICS RESPOND TO LAWSUIT  Separately on Tuesday, American Airlines\u2019 mechanics union, the TWU-IAM Association, said it was \u201cready and willing\u201d to return to the bargaining table to negotiate a fair contract, as long as it had a willing partner.  The comment followed a federal lawsuit filed by American alleging an illegal slowdown by its mechanics aimed at disrupting operations to improve their position in labor talks, which began in 2015.  \u201cWe would much prefer to be at the negotiating table than in a legal battle brought on by American,\u201d the TWU-IAM Association said in a statement.  American said the slowdowns had escalated following the last joint bargaining session on April 25, which was overseen by the National Mediation Board. The action has caused hundreds of flight cancellations and more than 1,000 maintenance delays, threatening further disruption during the busy U.S. summer, it said.  TWU-IAM, formed in 2015 after the merger of US Airways and American Airlines, said it wants to keep the company from outsourcing more maintenance and repair work to South America, China and Europe, and is \u201cstanding strong\u201d against cuts to medical benefits and retirement security.","217":"U.S. NTSB photo shows a part of the engine cowling from the Southwest Airlines plane which blew its engine in mid air yesterday over the skies of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S., in this image released on April 18, 2018.

As a result, Southwest has canceled 160 daily flights through Aug. 5, hitting revenue and costs, and putting its growth plans on hold. The low-cost carrier launched service to Hawaii earlier this year but has had to defer flying there from San Diego and Sacramento because of the MAX groundings.  \u201cBoeing made some mistakes ... they need to address those mistakes,\u201d Kelly said at the company\u2019s annual shareholders meeting in Denver, where Southwest has expanded faster than any other city.  Asked by a shareholder whether he was seeking compensation from Boeing, Kelly said: \u201cNo one is happy with the situation. All of our growth is with the MAX.\u201d  A handful among about 40 shareholders questioned Kelly about the airline\u2019s heavy MAX exposure. The MAX jets represent less than 5 percent of Southwest\u2019s fleet of about 750, but the airline has at least 249 more on order.  Southwest is scheduling flights on the MAX as of Aug. 6, but it is still unclear whether regulators will clear it to fly by then. They were grounded following an Ethiopian Airlines accident just five months after a similar Lion Air crash, killing a combined 346 people.  During a call with investors last month, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said he knows \u201cwe have some work to do to earn and re-earn the trust of our customers and the flying public in particular.\u201d  The Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s acting chief, Dan Elwell, told lawmakers on Wednesday he expects Boeing to submit a software fix soon, a key step to flying the planes again.  Asked by a reporter if he would fly on the first MAX flight, Kelly said: \u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d But he said Southwest would not fly the jets until he and regulators were fully confident in their safety.  A Reuters\/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday showed that U.S. fliers still consider ticket price the most important factor when choosing a flight. Southwest remained the most popular airline, with 21% of respondents picking it as their preferred carrier, up from 19% in a similar Reuters\/Ipsos poll that ran in June 2017.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Erroneous AOA sensor readings that led to aggressive nose-down inputs by a computer have been linked to deadly 737 MAX crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, according to preliminary reports from investigators.  Boeing offered customers two optional paid features relating to AOA. The first was an AOA DISAGREE alert when the two sensors disagreed and the second was an indicator giving pilots a gauge of the actual angle.  Southwest, the largest 737 MAX customer, in November told Reuters the alert was installed and it planned to add the indicator as well following the Lion Air crash in Indonesia.  The Wall Street Journal on Sunday reported that unbeknown to Southwest and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the alerts were not activated on the carrier\u2019s 737 MAX jets.  \u201cAfter the Lion Air event, Southwest was notified by Boeing that the AOA disagree lights were inoperable without the optional AOA indicators on the MAX aircraft,\u201d a Southwest spokesman said on Tuesday.  Boeing said on Monday that the disagree alert had been intended to be a standalone feature on the 737 MAX, but it was \u201cnot operable on all airplanes because the feature was not activated as intended\u201d.  \u201cThe disagree alert was tied or linked into the angle-of-attack indicator, which is an optional feature on the MAX,\u201d the manufacturer said in a statement. \u201cUnless an airline opted for the angle-of-attack indicator, the disagree alert was not operable...Boeing did not intentionally or otherwise deactivate the disagree alert on its MAX airplanes.\u201d  When Reuters contacted several 737 MAX operators about the optional features in November, only American Airlines and Singapore Airlines Ltd offshoot SilkAir confirmed they had installed both the alert and the indicator.  Canada\u2019s WestJet Airlines Ltd and Dubai\u2019s flydubai said they had installed the alert.  An Air Canada spokeswoman said on Tuesday that since November the alert and indicator had been installed on its fleet. Boeing said the disagree alert was not considered a safety feature and was not necessary for the safe operation of the plane. However, the company said following software modifications all new 737 MAX aircraft would have an activated and operable disagree alert and an optional angle-of-attack indicator, while current 737 MAX planes would have the ability to activate the disagree alert.

(Reporting by Rachit Vats in Bengaluru and Tracy Rucinski in Chicago Editing by Supriya Kurane)","226":"CHICAGO, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co reported a 21% fall in fourth-quarter profit on Thursday due to Boeing 737 MAX costs and warned that it will likely extend flight cancellations beyond June as the jets look set to remain parked well into this year.  Southwest, the world\u2019s largest 737 MAX operator, is among the airlines hardest hit by the global grounding of Boeing Co\u2019s once fast-selling jet in March following two fatal crashes, forcing thousands of monthly flight cancellations.  Dallas, Texas-based Southwest said net income fell to $514 million, or $0.98 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $654 million, or $1.17 per share, a year earlier.  The profit figure was below a Wall Street consensus forecast for $1.09 per share, mainly because Southwest said it treated a $124 million profit-sharing payment to employees that stemmed from a partial compensation agreement with Boeing last month as an operating expense while most analysts treated it as a one-time item.  \u201cI am pleased with the Boeing agreement for 2019. But, we continue to incur financial damages in 2020, and we will continue discussions with Boeing regarding further compensation,\u201d CEO Gary Kelly said.  Southwest has estimated a $828 million hit to operating profit from the MAX groundings in 2019. The airline has not factored future settlements into its 2020 outlook.  Total operating revenue rose 0.4% to $5.7 billion in the quarter, sustained by healthy travel demand -- which it sees continuing in the first quarter -- even as the company had to scale back its growth strategy due to a lack of airplanes.  Seat capacity fell 1.6% in 2019 from a year earlier versus an original plan to grow capacity by nearly 5%.  The airline had 34 MAX jets in its fleet at the time of the grounding and dozens more on order.  With the jets grounded, Southwest expects capacity to fall between 1.5% and 2.5% in the first quarter. It did not make a full-year estimate given continued MAX uncertainty.  Boeing said on Tuesday it does not expect to win approval for the 737 MAX to fly again until mid-year as regulators continue to scrutinize software and flight control updates and debate new pilot training requirements.  Based on that guidance, Southwest plans to take delivery of 27 MAX jets in 2020, though it warned the number could change and said it continues to plan for multiple return-to-service scenarios.  Southwest sees revenues per mile flown growing between 3.5% and 5.5% percent in the current quarter, though unit costs excluding fuel and profit-sharing expenses are seen spiking between 6% and 8% in the quarter.  Unit costs rose 5% in the fourth quarter versus the company\u2019s original estimate of a 2% decline before the MAX grounding, which is also hitting the company\u2019s fuel-efficiency. (Reporting by Tracy Rucinski)","227":"(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co\u2019s shares fell more than 5 percent on Wednesday after the low-cost U.S. carrier said it was investigating whether a conflict with its mechanics union was leading to a spike in flight cancellations.  The escalating labor dispute, one of the biggest to hit a top-four U.S. airline in more than a decade, comes amid a series of recent corporate headaches for the carrier.  Dallas-based Southwest was forced to delay its planned Hawaii launch due to the recent U.S. government shutdown and on Wednesday cut its first-quarter revenue growth forecast.  That followed news on Monday that the Federal Aviation Administration initiated a probe against the carrier in 2018 regarding weight and balance performance data.  Shares of Southwest fell 5.7 percent to close at $54.41 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.  The airline has canceled hundreds of flights since Feb. 15 due to a mixture of inclement weather and unscheduled maintenance issues that have put what it called an unprecedented number of aircraft out of service.  Southwest said there was no common theme among the maintenance issues, which followed the latest round of negotiations with the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA). The union represents about 2,400 Southwest mechanics and has been in contract talks with management since 2012.  Southwest Chief Operating Officer Mike Van de Ven said on Tuesday that the carrier would investigate why the number of aircraft unable to fly due to mechanical issues had doubled and said the airline remained committed to operating a safe fleet.  Last week the company declared an operational \u201cemergency\u201d and demanded all mechanics turn up for work.  FILE PHOTO: Southwest Airlines planes are seen in front of the Las Vegas strip, Nevada, United States April 23, 2015. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  AMFA disputed the carrier\u2019s characterization of the maintenance issues on its website and said Southwest has the lowest mechanic-to-aircraft ratio of any major carrier.  \u201cNegotiations and the degradation of safety culture are two entirely different items,\u201d Bret Oestreich, AMFA\u2019s national director, told Reuters.  The dispute comes at time when aviation deaths around the world have been falling. 2018 was the third-safest year ever in terms of the number of fatal accidents worldwide, according to the Aviation Safety Network.  Eric Schiffer, CEO of Reputation Management Consultants, said Southwest\u2019s handling of the aircraft disruption had likely \u201chighlighted a safety concern when there didn\u2019t need to be one.\u201d  \u201cAnd whenever an airline is associated with risk, it impacts shares and sales,\u201d Schiffer said in an interview on Wednesday.  American Airlines Group Inc is also in contract talks with its mechanics unions and asked for a federal mediator to facilitate negotiations last September. American\u2019s mechanic contracts have not been updated since it merged with US Airways in 2013.  Southwest canceled 444 flights on Wednesday, about 20 percent of total cancellations across the United States, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware.com. It was not clear how many of the cancellations were due to weather.  The next round of mediated contract talks with the mechanics union is scheduled for March 12, Southwest spokeswoman Brandy King said.  Southwest said it had already enhanced a contract offer that the union walked away from last fall.  SHUTDOWN HIT  Earlier on Wednesday, Southwest said it expected a $60 million sales hit from the recent U.S. government partial shutdown, four times its previous estimate.  While the 35-day U.S. shutdown ended on Jan. 25, King said passenger demand and bookings continued to suffer due to uncertainty over a potential second shutdown before a government deal was reached on Feb. 14.  As a result, Southwest trimmed its first-quarter growth forecast for revenue per available seat mile to a range of 3 to 4 percent from a previous range of 4 to 5 percent.  Southwest, which flies more domestic flights than legacy peers like American, said it is hopeful that first-quarter demand softness is temporary.  However, the more than month-long hiatus in U.S. government decision-making has delayed the federal authorization process for Southwest\u2019s plans to launch service to Hawaii, which it had hoped to begin early this year.  That process is currently under way, though the carrier has as yet been unable to announce a launch date.  Goldman Sachs said this means the airline will have a shorter window to sell tickets to Hawaii, forcing it to discount heavily at a time when most rivals expect an improvement in ticket prices. It issued a \u201csell\u201d recommendation on the stock.","228":"April 18 (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co:  * SOUTHWEST AIRLINES - SOUTHWEST AIRLINES FLIGHT 577 DEPARTING NASHVILLE TO PHOENIX EXPERIENCED BIRD STRIKE SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF  * SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO - THE FLIGHT 577 AIRCRAFT HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE FOR MAINTENANCE REVIEW Further company coverage:","229":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N said on Thursday it expected a hit of up to $300 million to its first-quarter operating revenue from the new coronavirus outbreak, prompting it to cut its quarterly revenue outlook.

JetBlue Airways Corp JBLU.O said on Wednesday it was cutting capacity by 5% and shares were down 10% on Thursday.  Concerns over the still largely unknown impact of the virus led top executives from Southwest, United Airlines, American Airlines and JetBlue to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday.  Trump said the executives did not ask for any financial assistance.  Southwest said it now expects first-quarter total revenue per available seat mile - a closely followed measure of airline performance - to be down 2% to up 1%, compared with a 3.5% to 5.5% growth it forecast earlier.

The airline said it would stop blocking middle seats in December, enabling it to tap more revenue on each flight.  Shares of American were flat after it said it would issue up to $1 billion of equity to further bolster liquidity, which reached $13.6 billion in September.  British Airways owner IAG ICAG.L warned on Thursday the travel slump from the coronavirus pandemic had deepened in Europe, leading to a larger-than-forecast quarterly loss.  U.S. domestic leisure demand has shown signs of improvement but passenger traffic will remain fragile until a COVID-19 vaccine is widely available, Southwest said, while highlighting recent studies showing that in-flight COVID-19 risk is low.  The World Health Organization (WHO) told Reuters that the risk of COVID-19 spreading on flights indeed appears \u201cvery low\u201d but cannot be ruled out, despite studies showing only a small number of cases.  Alaska Airlines ALK.N, which also posted quarterly results on Thursday, said it is blocking middle seats through early January, like Delta Air Lines DAL.N.  American and United Airlines UAL.O sell all available seats.  EYES ON CASH  American Airlines said it expects its cash burn rate to fall to about $25 million to $30 million a day in the fourth quarter from about $44 million per day in the third quarter and $58 million per day in the second.  To halt the bleed entirely, it would need about 65% to 70% of the $11 billion in revenue it reported in 2019. It drew in just $3.19 billion of revenue in the third quarter, down 73% from a year ago.  American also said it will tap $7.5 billion in federal loans, more than initially forecast.  Southwest said it would need to roughly double the $1.79 billion in revenue it booked in the third quarter to reach cash burn break-even, though CEO Gary Kelly told investors its $15.6 billion in liquidity is enough to last at least three years.

The FAA said it would respond directly to the lawmakers.  On Saturday, Dickson vowed to take \u201cstrong enforcement action\u201d against unruly passengers following reports of supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump disrupting flights returning from Washington after rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol.  Dickson said the \u201cFAA will pursue strong enforcement action against anyone who endangers the safety of a flight, with penalties ranging from monetary fines to jail time.\u201d  There have been numerous videos posted of unruly behavior on Washington flights, including one American Airlines flight to Phoenix in which the pilot threatened to divert \u201cto the middle of Kansas and dump people off.\u201d  A trade group representing major U.S. airlines said it will \u201ccontinue to work collaboratively with these authorities and our industry partners to provide a safe journey for travelers and employees.\u201d  The flight attendants union had urged airlines to bar Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol from departing Washington on commercial flights after exhibiting \u201cmob mentality behavior\u201d on flights into the region.

The grounding of Boeing\u2019s best-selling plane, which came in March after a second deadly crash, now threatens a second summer travel season. The death toll for the two crashes, the first in Indonesia and the second in Ethiopia, was 346 people.  Southwest, the largest operator of the MAX worldwide, said it is now removing roughly 330 weekday flights from its more than 4,000 daily flights, which is 10% higher than in December when it said it was removing roughly 300 weekday flights through April 13.  Once the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) gives 737 MAX approval to return to service, airlines will need at least 30 days to prepare the jets and its pilots for commercial flights, airline and union officials have said.  It is still unclear how much time the FAA may require pilots to spend in simulators before they can resume flights.  Reuters has reported the FAA will not approve the return of the MAX until February and it could slip until March or later. Last week, Boeing said it would recommend requiring all pilots to undergo simulator training before resuming flights, which may also push back the resumption of commercial flights.  Last month, United Airlines Holdings Inc UAL.O extended cancellations of its MAX flights from March until June 4.  Southwest said last month it reached a confidential compensation agreement with Boeing for a portion of a projected $830 million hit to 2019 operating income arising from the grounding of its 737 MAX aircraft and said it would share with its employees proceeds of about $125 million from Boeing.  The U.S. planemaker is revising the 737 MAX software to require a key safety system tied to both crashes to receive input from two sensors and has added significant additional safeguards.  Boeing and the FAA are still separately reviewing a wiring issue that could potentially cause a short circuit on the MAX.  The grounding is already having significant economic impacts. Boeing is halting production of the MAX this month and its biggest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc SPR.N, said last week it plans to lay off more than 20% of its workforce in Wichita, Kansas.","262":"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday rejected Southwest Airlines Co's LUV.N bid to dismiss a discrimination lawsuit by an American of Iraqi descent who was removed from a 2016 flight after another passenger heard him speak in Arabic and feared he might be a terrorist.

The 737 MAX training requirements were a topic of questioning at a hearing centered on Boeing Co\u2019s development of the aircraft that has come under scrutiny following two fatal crashes.  Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, asked Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg about the Southwest rebate, which he said would have covered 280 orders for the 737 MAX.

Changes in the new model led to the need for software known as MCAS that played a role in both fatal crashes.

A spokeswoman for the European Union Aviation Safety Agency said on Thursday it has made no recommendation and is \u201cwaiting for additional information from Boeing.\u201d  Last week, Boeing said it was continuing to \u201cperform the appropriate analysis\u201d but it was unclear when that \u201cwill lead to any design changes.\u201d  Boeing and FAA are also reviewing two software issues. One involves a power-up monitoring function that verifies some system monitors are operating correctly.  The other relates to an indicator light associated with the stabilizer trim system that incorrectly illuminated in the flight deck during testing.  FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson told reporters in Singapore this week, \u201cthe certification flight is the next major milestone and once that is completed I think we will have a good bit more clarity on where the process goes forward.\u201d"}}
