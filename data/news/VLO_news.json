Valero has reduced production at several refineries as demand fell because of stay-at-home orders to stem the spread of the coronavirus.  The company, which is the second-largest refiner in the United States by capacity, has begun to see an increase in demand in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Midwest as states in those regions begin to lift stay-at-home orders.  \u201cIt kind of got to the point where we were seeing demand about 55% of what we would call normal,\u201d said Gary Simmons, executive vice president and chief commercial officer. \u201cSo already, it\u2019s about a 9% increase of where we were in early April.\u201d  Overall, Valero expects gasoline demand to increase gradually, Simmons said.  \u201cWe see a fairly gradual recovery in demand, but gasoline demand getting back close to where it was the pre-COVID,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the jet side, I think we believe that the lower jet demand is probably here with us longer.\u201d  Ethan Bellamy of R.W.

Shares of Findlay, Ohio-based Marathon Petroleum gained as much as 7 percent to $79.43, while those of San Antonio, Texas-based Valero Energy Corp rose 4 percent to touch $113.53.  Most refiners in the United States process heavy crude from countries such as Venezuela or Canada into diesel, gasoline and other products, but the U.S. shale revolution has added millions of barrels of very light crude to the supply mix.  After reporting a doubling of profit in the second quarter, Marathon Petroleum Chief Executive Officer Gary Heminger said business prospects should hold up \u201cgiven strong global demand, wider crude differentials, and the changing dynamics of the low-sulfur fuel market.\u201d  The company said it plans to run 32 percent West Texas crude at its refineries in the third quarter, up from 23 percent a year earlier.  \u201cAs we look at our optionality and crude slate, we see opportunities to maximize usage of WTI crude,\u201d Heminger said on a post-earnings call with analysts.  Valero Energy CEO Joe Gorder said the refiner processed near record volumes of light crude in the second quarter.  Marathon\u2019s earnings beat estimates by 24 cents, while rival Valero posted a profit of $2.15 per share, ahead of estimate of $1.98.  Marathon\u2019s refining and marketing margin jumped 36 percent, while those for Valero rose 14 percent.  Margins were boosted by a discount on crude prices in Midland, Texas, which widened by nearly $10 a barrel against the benchmark during the second quarter, as production in the Permian surged beyond pipeline capacity. Lower tax rates also helped.  Strong crack spreads - the margin on turning crude oil into diesel, gasoline and other products - also spurred utilization rates, or the extent to which refineries are running at full capacity without downtime.  Marathon operated its refineries at near full capacity in the quarter, while Valero ran at 93 percent and expects it to scale up to 95 percent in the current quarter.  The rise in margins was also helped by wider differentials between Western Canada Select, the benchmark for heavy crude found in Canada\u2019s oil sands, and U.S. crude as a result of supply bottlenecks in Canada.  Revenue rose 22 percent at Marathon, while it surged 39 percent at Valero.  Profit at Valero jumped 54.2 percent from a year earlier, also helped by a drop in biofuel blending costs to $131 million from $255 million a year earlier, mainly due to lower Renewable Identification Number (RIN) prices.  RINs, which are renewable fuel credits, are used to comply with the country's biofuels requirements. A surge in waivers to refiners seeking exemptions here from the law under President Donald Trump's administration has sent the price of biofuels compliance credits to five-year lows.","23":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. independent refiner Valero Energy Corp plans to run its 14 refineries up to 93 percent of their combined capacity of 3.1 million barrels-per-day (bpd) in the second quarter of 2019, said Homer Bhullar, vice president of investor relations, on Thursday.  Valero expects its seven U.S. Gulf Coast refineries will run up to 96 percent of their combined capacity of 1.8 million bpd during the quarter, Bhullar said during a conference call to discuss first quarter earnings with Wall Street analysts.  The company\u2019s 145,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Benicia, California, refinery is expected to restart in mid to late May following an overhaul, said Chief Operating Officer Lane Riggs.  The refinery was shut in late March to repair a furnace and the company decided to perform an overhaul scheduled for 2020 while the plant was out of service, Riggs said.  In early March, Valero repaired the main air blower on the 55,000 bpd gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit at Valero\u2019s 195,000 bpd Sunray, Texas, refinery.  Valero expects the switch to low sulfur marine fuel mandated by the International Maritime Organization on Jan. 1, 2020, will first be felt in late September and October in the high-sulfur bunker fuel market, when the last cargos of marine fuel with a sulfur content of 3.5 percent will be sent to Asia, said Chief Executive Joe Gorder.  Diesel markets, which are expected to tighten on higher demand for marine fuel with a sulfur content of 0.5 percent in January, will feel the impact in November and December, Gorder said.  Valero has replaced Venezuelan crude with a combination of Canadian crude and crude purchased on the open market including supply from Brazil going to the Gulf and West coasts of the United States, he said.","24":"FILE PHOTO: A Valero Energy Corp. gas station is pictured in El Cajon, California, U.S., August 8, 2017.

Throughput for the second quarter dropped 22% to 2.3 million bpd, while refining margins fell 58% to $1.08 billion.  Credit Suisse analyst Manav Gupta said the results were better-than-feared, helped by Valero\u2019s renewable diesel and ethanol segments. He added refining equities would move higher or lower, depending upon whether Texas, Florida and Arizona can successfully avoid another virus-led shutdown.  On an adjusted basis, Valero lost $1.25 per share in the reported quarter, compared to analysts\u2019 estimates of a loss of $1.41 per share loss, according to Refinitiv IBES.  The San Antonio, Texas-based company also recorded a gain of $1.8 billion in the quarter related to inventory valuation.","25":"(Reuters) - Two of the biggest independent oil refiners in the United States beat Wall Street profit estimates on Thursday as greater processing of cheap, light crude from West Texas helped boost margins.  Most refiners in the United States process heavy crude from Venezuela or Canada into diesel, gasoline and other products, but the U.S. shale revolution has added millions of barrels of very light crude to the supply mix.  After reporting a doubling of profit in the second quarter, Marathon Petroleum MPC.N chief Gary Heminger said business prospects should stay strong \"given strong global demand, wider crude differentials, and the changing dynamics of the low-sulfur fuel market.\"  Revenue at both Marathon and independent refiner Valero Energy Corp VLO.N surged by 22 percent and 39 percent respectively.  Marathon\u2019s profit beat estimates for the quarter by 24 cents, while rival Valero posted a profit of $2.15 per share, ahead of expectations of $1.98 per share.  Strong crack spreads - the margin on turning crude oil into diesel, gasoline and other products - have spurred utilization rates, or the extent to which refiners are running at full capacity without downtime.  Marathon\u2019s refining and marketing margin jumped 36 percent to $15.40, while those for Valero rose 14 percent jump.  The refiners\u2019 earnings were also boosted by a discount on crude prices in Midland, Texas, which widened by nearly $10 a barrel against benchmark futures during the second quarter, as production in the Permian surged beyond pipeline capacity to move oil out of the region.  Total revenue and other income at Marathon rose to $22.45 billion from $18.35 billion while that at Valero jumped to $31.02 billion from $22.25 billion a year earlier.  Profit at Valero rose 54.2 percent rise compared to the same quarter a year earlier.","26":"(Reuters) - Valero Energy Corp VLO.N posted a better-than-expected first quarter profit as the independent U.S. refiner benefited from higher refining margins.  Valero has a diverse set of refineries that allows it to take advantage of volatile crude price differentials and process lower-quality feedstock into high-value refined products such as gasoline and distillates.  \u201cOur refineries are well-situated to take advantage of discounted heavy sour and domestic sweet crude oils versus Brent and to meet the growing demand for refined products in Latin America,\u201d Chief Executive Joe Gorder said in a statement.  Valero said refining margins, or the difference between buying of crude and average selling price of refined products, rose 6.1 percent to $2.21 billion in the first quarter ended March 31.  The company reported higher refining margins at its U.S. mid-continent and West Coast regions. Gulf of Mexico and North Atlantic margins narrowed slightly.  San Antonio, Texas-based Valero has also been investing heavily in logistics assets such as pipelines and storage facilities to reduce costs and increase margins.  The company maintained its $2.7 billion capital expenditure forecast for the year.  Net income attributable to Valero shareholders rose to $469 million, or $1.09 per share, from $305 million, or $0.68 per share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, Valero earned $1 per share, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate by 6 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Revenue rose 21.4 percent to $26.44 billion.","27":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. independent refiners are expected to roll out lower than expected first-quarter profits after a spate of outages, weak gasoline margins and a surge in the price of Canadian oil, according to analysts.  FILE PHOTO: An aerial view of the Valero Houston Refinery is seen in Houston, Texas, U.S. August 31, 2017. REUTERS\/Adrees Latif  Major independent refiners cut production dramatically during the quarter, with some electing to undergo maintenance rather than produce barrels at a time when gasoline margins slumped.  Several major U.S. refiners, including Valero Energy Corp, HollyFrontier Corp, and Marathon Petroleum Corp, are all expected to fall short of consensus estimates when they report results, according to Refinitiv Eikon\u2019s SmartEstimate model, which values more recent revisions from higher-ranked analysts.  However, reduced refining output in the early part of the year sets up the industry for a potential rebound as the critical summer months approach. With gasoline stockpiles at a four-year low on a seasonal basis, margins have rebounded in anticipation of driving season.  U.S. refinery utilization dropped to 87.5 percent in early April, the lowest seasonally since 2014. Refiners had been running full-tilt for much of 2018, encouraged by strong demand for distillates. But in the process, they overproduced gasoline, tanking margins for the fuel along the way.  Those margins fell to $3.64 a gallon in January, the lowest since 2009. They have since recovered, and were at about $23.00 a gallon on Monday, as inventories have fallen to about 228 million barrels from almost 260 million barrels in mid-January.  Refiner earnings kick off this week with Valero on Friday. Since the beginning of April, analysts, on average, have revised projections for refiners lower by more than 5 percent, according to Refinitiv data.  Analysts have sharply lowered estimates for Valero, Marathon and HollyFrontier, along with PBF Energy and Phillips 66, in the past month, putting them in the bottom quartile among U.S. companies in terms of revisions, according to Refinitiv data.  On top of heavy maintenance, fires broke out at facilities over the last few months, including at Valero\u2019s Port Arthur, Texas, refinery, Exxon Mobil Corp\u2019s Baytown, Texas, refinery and HollyFrontier\u2019s El Dorado, Kansas, refinery.  HollyFrontier lowered the amount of crude it expected to process in the first quarter by 5,000 bpd. Analysts at Goldman Sachs downgraded the company\u2019s outlook last week on concerns that profits would take a hit after Canadian crude differentials collapsed.  Sandy Fielden, director of commodities and energy research at Morningstar, said PBF also lost out because of \u201cthe Canadian crude discount just disappearing.\u201d  Canadian crude oil had been heavily discounted due to oversupply and lack of pipelines, but that discount eroded after the province of Alberta instituted production cuts. Western Canada Select (WCS) recently has traded around $9.25 a barrel under U.S. crude, compared with $15.65 at the beginning of the quarter. [CRU\/CA]  BUMPER BUNKER PROFITS?  Some refiners decided to undergo heavier planned maintenance during the quarter to ready facilities for new low-sulfur marine fuel requirements. The new regulations required by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) are due to come into effect on Jan. 1, 2020 and could produce bumper profits.  The rules outlaw high-sulfur fuels traditionally used for shipping - a boon for complex refineries that can break down products used by marine vessels into lower-sulfur products with higher margins.  Refiners could now run their plants at higher rates to take advantage of the higher margins, and analysts expect gasoline inventories to climb through the remainder of the year as a result.","28":"HOUSTON, March 19 (Reuters) - An employee at Valero Energy Corp\u2019s Meraux, Louisiana, refinery tested positive for the coronavirus, sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.

FILE PHOTO: The prices at a Valero Energy Corp gas station are pictured in Pasadena, California October 27, 2015. REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni\/File Photo  Venezuelan oil production has tumbled to a multi-decade low this year, cutting shipments to buyers in the United States and elsewhere and worsening a severe economic recession. Its crude exports averaged 1.19 million barrels per day (bpd) in the January-April period, 28 percent less than the same period in 2017.  The country\u2019s exports this month also have been hit by ConocoPhillips\u2019 moves to seize PDVSA cargoes and storage facilities in the Caribbean to pay a $2 billion arbitration award over a 2007 expropriation of its projects in the country.  Amid the dwindling exports, Valero received over 200,000 bpd of Venezuelan crude from state-run oil company PDVSA and its joint ventures in March and April, the largest monthly volumes since December 2016, according to the data.  Valero, the largest U.S. refiner by capacity, and PDVSA did not immediately reply to requests for comment.  The San Antonio, Texas company\u2019s imports vaulted it over PDVSA\u2019s U.S. refining unit Citgo Petroleum [PDVSAC.UL] as the largest receiver of Venezuelan barrels in the United States this year, the data shows. Valero\u2019s purchases rose 5.4 percent to 173,080 bpd in the first four months of 2018, while Citgo\u2019s decreased 26 percent to 155,527 bpd.  Purchases by PDVSA\u2019s other large U.S. customers, including Chevron Corp, Phillips 66 and PBF Energy, continued to fall on a year-over-year basis.  In April, the United States overall imported 512,182 bpd of Venezuelan crude, a 12.6 percent increase compared with the prior month, but levels were 31 percent below April 2017, according to the data. U.S. buyers are among PDVSA\u2019s few cash-paying customers since its oil is used to pay off loans to China and Russia.  Venezuela\u2019s large export decline and international condemnation of President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s re-election this week, which has started triggering new sanctions, is creating tension in the global oil market.  Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude prices rose on Tuesday amid worries that Venezuela\u2019s crude output could drop further following the election. OPEC is looking closely at the nation\u2019s production drop to decide if the loss of supply will require action by the group, according to sources.  PDVSA last year started requesting crude from its joint ventures in the Orinoco Belt, Venezuela\u2019s largest producing region, to supply its domestic refineries, which also has reduced the volume of oil available to U.S. customers, including Citgo.  Since 2017, financial sanctions on Venezuela and PDVSA and quality problems with some PDVSA\u2019s crude grades also have created obstacles for U.S. customers to import or pay for oil shipments from the South American country, affecting refiners such as PBF and Phillips 66.  But the export drop has not stopped Valero from receiving more Venezuelan oil through its existing, long-term supply contracts with PDVSA. Most of its purchases are made under open-credit terms that have not been affected by U.S. financial sanctions, according to traders.  In April, Valero received 13 cargoes of Venezuelan crude for its U.S. Gulf refineries compared with nine cargoes imported by Citgo Petroleum, according to the Reuters data.","41":"April 26 (Reuters) - Valero Energy Partners LP:  * REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2018 RESULTS  * Q1 REVENUE $132 MILLION VERSUS I\/B\/E\/S VIEW $126 MILLION  * PARTNERSHIP CONTINUES TO TARGET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $35 MILLION TO $45 MILLION FOR 2018  * QTRLY NET INCOME PER LIMITED PARTNER COMMON UNIT $0.72  * Q1 EARNINGS PER SHARE VIEW $0.69, REVENUE VIEW $126.0 MILLION -- THOMSON REUTERS I\/B\/E\/S Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","42":"HOUSTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Valero Energy Corp may restart the small crude distillation unit (CDU) at its 335,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Port Arthur, Texas, refinery next week, sources familiar with plant operations said on Friday.

Severe weather interrupted operations on the Diamond Pipeline, and the crude supply from the pipeline fell below the needed amount to operate the refinery late on Thursday morning, the sources said.  Most of the units at the Memphis refinery are on circulation, kept at operating temperature and moving a specialized feedstock in a loop through the individual units which would enable to units to restart quickly, the sources said.  A Valero spokeswoman did not reply to a request for comment about operations at the Memphis refinery on Thursday.  The Valero refinery is the primary supplier of jet fuel to the Memphis International Airport, where FedEx Corp has its hub for global operations.  The outage, along with data from Genscape showing a 1.5 million-barrel weekly increase in crude stocks sent prices lower at the Cushing, Oklahoma, hub, traders said.  U.S. Midwest gasoline cash differentials rose on Thursday. Chicago CBOB gasoline gained 2.00 cents a gallon to trade at 1.50 cents per gallon above the gasoline futures benchmark on NYMEX.

The total number of U.S. refineries shrank by two to 135 plants.  Each year in June, the EIA releases the report based on forms about production capacity completed by the refineries and submitted by Jan. 1 of the year in which the report is issued.  Valero\u2019s total combined crude oil refining capacity across 14 plants was 2.16 million bpd, the EIA said, down from 2.18 million in the 2017 report. Most of the decline came from a reduction at the company\u2019s Corpus Christi, Texas, refinery.  Valero\u2019s position as the nation\u2019s largest refiner for the past 11 years could change by the time the EIA issues its next report if regulators approve the proposed merger between Marathon Petroleum Corp and Andeavor.  The $23-billion merger, announced in April, would give the new Marathon 2.98 million bpd or 16 percent of total national capacity. Valero\u2019s combined capacity is equal to 11.6 percent of the U.S. total.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  The San Antonio, Texas-based company, one of the largest buyers of Venezuelan crude in the United States, said it had stopped intake from the country after the U.S. slapped sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA earlier this week. (reut.rs\/2Gd1gMW)  PDVSA exports roughly 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) to the United States.  Valero has been substituting light crude oil from North America and other sources to make up for the lack of Venezuelan heavy crude, supply and international operations Senior Vice President Gary Simmons said on a conference call with Wall Street analysts.  Refiners like Valero, Phillips 66 and Marathon Petroleum Corp process crude into diesel, gasoline, and other products.  \u201cThe current economics are certainly pushing the country to maximize light sweet in the system,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Joseph Gorder said.  During the quarter, refining margins rose 26 percent to $3.05 billion in the last three months of 2018.  \u201cThe main driver of the beat was solid performance in every region of the refining segment, but particular stand-outs were the Gulf Coast and North Atlantic regions,\u201d Simmons Energy analysts Blake Fernandez and Patrick Flam said.  Valero plans to run its 14 refineries at up to 95 percent of their combined production capacity of 3.1 million bpd in the first quarter of 2019.  The company, which has also been investing heavily in pipelines and storage to reduce costs, said the completion of some projects provided it with greater access to discounted North American crudes in the fourth quarter.  \u201cWe also set a record on the volume of Canadian heavy that we ran in our system,\u201d Valero\u2019s Simmons said.  Access to cheaper crude helped boost profitability.  On an adjusted basis, income attributable to Valero shareholders rose to $900 million, or $2.12 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $509 million, or $1.16 per share, a year earlier.  Analysts had expected earnings of $1.07 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. In the year-earlier quarter, the company had recorded a $1.9 billion gain from U.S. tax reforms.  The company\u2019s shares rose 5 percent to $87.44 in midday trade.","84":"April 26 (Reuters) - Valero Energy Corp:  * EXPECT Q2 THROUGHPUT VOLUMES TO RANGE BETWEEN 1.61 MILLION AND 1.66 MILLION BPD IN U.S. GULF COAST - CONF CALL  * EXPECT SECOND QUARTER REFINING CASH OPERATING EXPENSES TO BE ABOUT $3.85 PER BARREL- CONF CALL  * EXPECT ETHANOL BUSINESS TO TOTAL 4 MILLION GALLONS PER DAY IN Q2 - CONF CALL  * EXPECT RINS EXPENSE TO BE BETWEEN $500 MILLION AND $600 MILLION THIS YEAR - CONF CALL  * VALERO ENERGY- EXPECT RETAIL GASOLINE DEMAND TO BE HIT IF CRUDE RISES TO $80-$100 PER BARREL - CONF CALL  * VALERO ENERGY - DON\u2019T THINK THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONSOLIDATION IN THE REFINING BUSINESS - CONF CALL  * VALERO ENERGY - GASOLINE EXPORTS TOTALED 73,000 BPD IN Q1 AND DIESEL 163,000 BPD IN Q1 - CONF CALL Further company coverage: (Reuters.Briefs@thomsonreuters.com)","85":"FILE PHOTO: A Valero logo is seen at a Valero gas station in Hoboken, New Jersey, U.S., May 2, 2016.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  (Reuters) - U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corp VLO.N posted better-than-expected third-quarter results on Thursday as fuel demand recovered after a sharp cut earlier in the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic that hurt travel.  The company said refining throughput, or the amount of crude it processed, averaged 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd), an improvement of 200,000 bpd from the prior quarter as demand for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel recovered in step with global economies opening up.  Valero slightly lowered its investment budget for the year, but raised its bet on the future of renewable diesel by allocating a larger portion of planned expenses to such projects.  Investor clamor for clean energy, coupled with the slump in demand for gasoline, has pushed refiners to accelerate plans for retrofitting facilities to produce so-called renewable diesel, which is made from used cooking oil, among other things, and burns cleaner than conventional diesel.  The company said it now expects to invest around 40% of its growth capital this year and next towards expansion of the renewables business. It had allocated 30% at the end of the second quarter. Valero\u2019s capital investments for 2020 and 2021 are expected to total $2 billion, down from $2.1 billion for 2020 that it forecast in July.  Adjusted net loss of $1.16 per share for the three months ended Sept. 30 was below analysts\u2019 average estimate of $1.49, according to Refinitiv IBES data.  Valero, which kicked off refining earnings for the quarter, said revenue fell to $15.81 billion from $27.25 billion a year earlier, but was still above Wall Street\u2019s estimate of $15.60 billion.","87":"A Valero logo is seen at a Valero gas station in Hoboken, New Jersey, U.S., May 2, 2016.

Pure Biofuels Del Peru owns an approximately 1-million- barrel liquid storage terminal, a biodiesel production facility, and two refined products terminals at Callao, near Lima, and Paita in the north of the country. Financial terms were not disclosed.  Cos Cob, Connecticut-based Pegasus is exiting an investment first made in April 2012.

Valero currently has refining operations in the United States, Canada and Britain, and is one of North America\u2019s largest ethanol producers, according to its website.  Peru is heavily dependent on imports of both fuel ethanol and biodiesel to meet blending rules for gasoline and diesel, which were introduced in 2010 and 2011 respectively to reduce emissions and improve air quality.  Having closed one of two fuel ethanol production facilities in 2015, Peruvian production was forecast at around 118 million liters in 2017, versus expected demand of 182 million liters, according to a September 2017 report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  Peruvian imports of biodiesel were expected to fall by 33 percent to 250 million liters in 2017, after the government slapped anti-dumping tariffs on Argentina the previous year. But imports still dwarf domestic production, which only resumed in 2017 after a three-year hiatus and was expected around 60 million liters, the same report said.","88":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Employees at Valero Energy Corp\u2019s Port Arthur, Texas, refinery expressed worries about the company\u2019s slow response to keep the coronavirus from spreading there after two workers tested positive, four people familiar with the matter said.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Valero, the nation\u2019s second-largest refiner, started to cut non-essential work and related contractors only this week after starting temperature checks last week - much later than other major U.S. refiners, according to the people.  Valero spokeswoman Lillian Riojas said the company maintains the privacy of employee health information and as such would \u201cnot publicize individual cases of COVID-19.\u201d  Riojas, however, outlined Valero\u2019s response in case of a positive test, saying it included compliance and cooperation with the Centers for Disease Control and local health authorities, sterilization of affected areas and communicating with employees in \u2018close contact\u2019 with those affected.  That is \u201cfollowed by implementation of appropriate quarantines, communication with our employees at the site, and, most importantly support of all affected employees.\u201d  Globally, the coronavirus has infected over 1.3 million people and killed more than 74,000. The United States has the most number of cases, at more than 360,000.  The pandemic presents significant challenges to energy facilities like power generation plants, offshore drilling platforms and refineries, where remote operation is often not possible and some staffing is needed to run key units.  Refiners are still meeting customer needs for gasoline and jet fuel that have slowed to a trickle in the United States and globally as the pandemic keeps people at home.  The largest U.S. refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp, and Exxon Mobil Corp, the third largest, cut contract workers, who perform maintenance, two weeks ago.  Temperature checks for people entering refineries began about the same time at major U.S. refineries.  VALERO COVID-19 CASES  But Valero has lagged, the people said.  Unable to work from home, many Port Arthur refinery employees are indoors in shared control rooms and eat in common dining areas, placing them at greater risk of contracting COVID-19, the sources added on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to media.  The Port Arthur refinery processes 335,000 barrels of crude oil per day, though it has lately been running at reduced rates due to weakened demand for products.  The refinery employs more than 900 salaried and hourly workers. Its about 450 hourly workers are represented by the United Steelworkers union (USW). About 750 contract workers are employed by third-party companies Valero hires to perform maintenance in the refinery.  The first case reported at the refinery was a contract worker who had no contact with employees, but had contact with another contract worker who had access to a building used by employees, the sources said.  Employees were notified on March 28.  Temperature checks were implemented after employees were notified about the first case.  \u201cIn my opinion it was a very meager cover-your-ass by a company that has already had a contractor working inside the fence who tested positive for COVID-19,\u201d one of the sources said of the temperature checks.  The second case was an employee, the sources said.  The company notified its employees on April 5, adding the affected person has not been in the refinery since March 27.  The two people and those who worked closely with that person were sent home for 14 days and the places where they were working underwent \u201cenhanced cleaning,\u201d according to the sources.  Officials with USW 13-423 in Port Arthur, which represents workers at the Valero refinery, declined comment.  In other recent incidents, BP Plc said some workers have contracted COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, on offshore platforms in the Gulf Coast and at a facility in Alaska.","89":"Valero Energy Corp will promote its general counsel Jason Fraser to chief financial officer next month, the independent U.S. refiner disclosed in a securities filing.

Valero spokeswoman Lillian Riojas said the injured worker was taken to a local hospital. The extent of the person\u2019s injuries was unknown. All other workers at the refinery were accounted for.  Energy industry intelligence service Genscape said the refinery was shut at about the time the fire broke out, shortly before 1 a.m. CDT (0600 GMT).  The fire broke out in the refinery\u2019s hydrocracker, said sources familiar with plant operations. The hydrocracker converts gas oil into motor fuels, primarily diesel.  Riojas said the fire was contained to the area where it broke out.  WWL-TV in New Orleans reported that the fire began with an explosion that was felt up to 7 miles (11 km) away.  Valero is the second-largest refiner in the United States, operating 13 refineries with a combined crude oil processing capacity of 2.2 million bpd, 11.6% of the national total.

The addition of a second coker will allow it to keep running at high production levels when one coker needs to be shut for planned maintenance or repairs.  Cokers convert residual crude oil into feedstock for motor fuels and petroleum coke, a coal substitute.","94":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Venezuela\u2019s September crude sales to the United States rose to their highest in over a year, boosted by purchases by Citgo Petroleum, the U.S. refining arm of Venezuela\u2019s state-run PDVSA, and Valero Energy, according to Refinitiv Eikon trade flows data.  A collision in August at a dock of Venezuela\u2019s main oil port of Jose has limited exports in large vessels to Asia, spurring loading of more medium-size tankers including those typically covering routes to the United States.  Venezuela\u2019s overall crude exports fell 14 percent in September to 1.105 million bpd due to declining oil output and dock woes at Jose terminal. The OPEC-member country\u2019s crude production fell for third time in a row to 1.448 million bpd in August, according to official figures.  The United States imported 601,505 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuelan crude last month, a 28-percent increase versus August and the highest monthly average since August 2017, according to the Refinitiv Eikon data.  Valero and Citgo bought over 250,000 bpd each of Venezuelan crude last month compared with an average of 170,000 bpd earlier this year, according to the data.  A total of 38 cargoes were purchased by U.S. customers from PDVSA and its joint ventures in September. At least three of those shipments were co-loaded in different Venezuelan ports to avoid problems at Jose, where repairs are expected to take at least one more month to be completed.  PDVSA\u2019s exports last month included more light and medium crudes, generally produced at very low levels in Venezuela and leaving less of these grades for PDVSA\u2019s domestic refineries to produce fuels.  In September, PDVSA sold Citgo and Valero some 84,000 bpd of Santa Barbara, Mesa and Leona crudes, which are typically processed at Venezuelan refineries.  PDVSA regularly imports gasoline, diesel, liquefied petroleum gas and refining feedstock to offset low production at its refineries.","95":"May 17 (Reuters) - Valero Energy Corp:  * VALERO ENERGY CORP FILES FOR POTENTIAL DEBT SHELF OFFERING; SIZE NOT DISCLOSED - SEC FILING Source text: (bit.ly\/2wPawUj) Further company coverage:","96":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Valero Energy Corp plans to keep its 335,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Port Arthur, Texas, refinery in operation during the week as potentially heavy rains threaten the Gulf Coast city, said sources familiar with plant operations.

Major independent refiners cut production dramatically during the quarter, with some electing to undergo maintenance rather than produce barrels at a time when gasoline margins slumped.  Several major U.S. refiners, including Valero Energy Corp , HollyFrontier Corp, and Marathon Petroleum Corp , are all expected to fall short of consensus estimates when they report results, according to Refinitiv Eikon\u2019s SmartEstimate model, which values more recent revisions from higher-ranked analysts.  However, reduced refining output in the early part of the year sets up the industry for a potential rebound as the critical summer months approach. With gasoline stockpiles at a four-year low on a seasonal basis, margins have rebounded in anticipation of driving season.  U.S. refinery utilization dropped to 87.5 percent in early April, the lowest seasonally since 2014. Refiners had been running full-tilt for much of 2018, encouraged by strong demand for distillates. But in the process, they overproduced gasoline, tanking margins for the fuel along the way.  Those margins fell to $3.64 a gallon in January, the lowest since 2009. They have since recovered, and were at about $23.00 a gallon on Monday, as inventories have fallen to about 228 million barrels from almost 260 million barrels in mid-January. (GRAPHIC: Gasoline stocks fall as refinery runs drop tmsnrt.rs\/2Iafyjp.)  Refiner earnings kick off this week with Valero on Friday. Since the beginning of April, analysts, on average, have revised projections for refiners lower by more than 5 percent, according to Refinitiv data.  Analysts have sharply lowered estimates for Valero, Marathon and HollyFrontier, along with PBF Energy and Phillips 66 , in the past month, putting them in the bottom quartile among U.S. companies in terms of revisions, according to Refinitiv data.  On top of heavy maintenance, fires broke out at facilities over the last few months, including at Valero\u2019s Port Arthur, Texas, refinery, Exxon Mobil Corp\u2019s Baytown, Texas, refinery and HollyFrontier\u2019s El Dorado, Kansas, refinery.  HollyFrontier lowered the amount of crude it expected to process in the first quarter by 5,000 bpd. Analysts at Goldman Sachs downgraded the company\u2019s outlook last week on concerns that profits would take a hit after Canadian crude differentials collapsed.  Sandy Fielden, director of commodities and energy research at Morningstar, said PBF also lost out because of \u201cthe Canadian crude discount just disappearing.\u201d  Canadian crude oil had been heavily discounted due to oversupply and lack of pipelines, but that discount eroded after the province of Alberta instituted production cuts. Western Canada Select (WCS) recently has traded around $9.25 a barrel under U.S. crude, compared with $15.65 at the beginning of the quarter.  BUMPER BUNKER PROFITS?  Some refiners decided to undergo heavier planned maintenance during the quarter to ready facilities for new low-sulfur marine fuel requirements. The new regulations required by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) are due to come into effect on Jan. 1, 2020 and could produce bumper profits.  The rules outlaw high-sulfur fuels traditionally used for shipping - a boon for complex refineries that can break down products used by marine vessels into lower-sulfur products with higher margins.  Refiners could now run their plants at higher rates to take advantage of the higher margins, and analysts expect gasoline inventories to climb through the remainder of the year as a result.","99":"April 26 (Reuters) - Valero Energy Corp posted a 54 percent rise in first-quarter profit on Thursday as the U.S. refiner benefited from higher refining margins.
