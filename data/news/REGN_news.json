The new approval, which could significantly boost annual sales, is for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.

The company is one of the many drugmakers looking to tackle COVID-19, caused by the new coronavirus that has no current approved treatment or vaccine and has claimed over 250,000 lives worldwide.  Regeneron is developing an antibody cocktail with the aim to make clinical data available within a month or two after starting the studies and scale up its manufacturing to produce 200,000 doses per month by the end of summer.  The company\u2019s shares rose 6% to $574.98 in late morning trade.  \u201cThe hope is it might be possible by the end of the summer or the fall that our antibody treatment could be available,\u201d Regeneron co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer George Yancopoulos said on a conference call.  \u201cA lot of risks, a lot of concerns, but we are working as hard as we can with so many collaborators to try to turn that into a reality,\u201d he added.  The drugmaker said it would test the antibody cocktail in three different settings to assess its effectiveness in early stages of the disease, hospitalized patients with severe disease as well as in preventing infection.  Regeneron is also testing its rheumatoid arthritis drug, Kevzara, in the sickest coronavirus patients, banking on the theory that it could help regulate a dangerous overreaction by the body\u2019s immune system, which may be triggering the respiratory distress seen in severe cases.  Regeneron also beat quarterly profit estimates on Tuesday after demand for its blockbuster eye drug, Eylea, saw little impact from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Widespread lockdowns imposed to curb the spread of the outbreak have prompted patients to reschedule their hospital visits, hitting sales of rival eye drug Lucentis, jointly developed by Novartis NOVN.S and Roche ROG.S.  With a nearly 15% decline in Eylea demand in April, Regeneron expects its second quarter to take the biggest hit from the COVID-19 outbreak and said it was encouraged by a recent rebound in demand for its hospital-administered drugs.  Global Eylea sales rose 6.3% to $1.85 billion during the quarter.  Excluding items, Regeneron earned $6.60 per share, while its revenue rose 33.2% to $1.83 billion.  Analysts on average had expected earnings of $6.13 per share on revenue of $1.76 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.","2":"Feb 5 (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc on Friday reported a 45% rise in quarterly profit, benefiting from a recovery in demand for its flagship eye drug, Eylea, which took a hit last year due to the pandemic.

The drug, Praluent, dramatically lowers bad LDL cholesterol and reduces the risk of heart attacks and death in high-risk heart patients.  But sales of Praluent and a rival Amgen drug, with list prices of more than $14,000 a year before discounts, have been severely constrained by onerous roadblocks to patient access by insurers. They routinely reject about 70 percent of prescriptions written, the companies have said.  \u201cI expect this to substantially increase the sales,\u201d Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer said of the Express Scripts deal.  Regeneron and Sanofi said in March they would be willing to lower Praluent\u2019s price in exchange for easier patient access. They said pricing could be tied to an independent review by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), which put an appropriate Praluent price for highest risk patients at $4,500 to $8,000 a year.  The Praluent net price will be at the \u201clow end\u201d of the ICER range including double-digit rebates, said Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller. Rebates are still needed to reward plans for choosing the drug, he added.  The arrangement makes Praluent exclusive on the Express Scripts\u2019 national formulary for the drug class known as PCSK9 inhibitors, meaning customers of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) will mostly not have access to Amgen\u2019s Repatha.  Beginning July 1, doctors can submit just one form attesting that a patient with heart disease meets criteria for PCSK9 therapy, such as inability to sufficiently lower LDL with cheap statins, like Pfizer\u2019s Lipitor.  \u201cThis ... addresses head-on the frustrations caused by complex pre-authorization requirements that hamstring physicians and put an important medicine out of reach from patients,\u201d Michelle Carnahan, head of Sanofi\u2019s North America cardiovascular business, said in a statement.  Starting next year, Express Scripts will pass along a portion of Praluent rebates it receives from the drugmakers to people in eligible health benefit plans, lowering out-of-pocket costs.  \u201cThis is a significant (price) reduction that the patients will also feel, not just the insurance companies or the employers,\u201d Schleifer said.  He said talks were taking place with other insurers and PBMs about similar arrangements.  \u201cI hope that this will spread like wildfire through the entire payer system,\u201d Schleifer said.","6":"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc said on Monday its experimental treatment for Ebola proved superior to a rival therapy from Mapp Biopharmaceutical at preventing death, in a trial evaluating four treatments for infections caused by the deadly virus.

Libtayo, which boosts the immune system to fight cancer, will be sold in the United States at a list price of $9,100 for a three-week treatment cycle.

The drug, injected into the eye to treat age-related macular degeneration and other diseases, is a major growth driver for Regeneron, and showed no sign of stopping in the quarter despite competition from Roche Holding AG ROG.S and Novartis AG's NOVN.S Lucentis.  U.S. sales of Eylea jumped 17% to $1.16 billion in the latest quarter, topping expectations of about $1.10 billion, according to consensus estimates compiled by brokerage Credit Suisse.  However, Eylea could face possible patent losses in the next five years and analysts expect sales to be further threatened next year by broluciuzmab, an experimental drug developed by Novartis.  Investors have also been cautious as the drug pricing debate rages on in the United States and they digest ambitious proposals from the government as well as from Democratic presidential candidates.  Among the many proposals aimed at lowering costs is a plan to create an \u201cinternational pricing index\u201d that would link the price Medicare pays for drugs to the lower prices paid overseas.  \u201cThese results represent a clear positive, albeit against the backdrop of drug pricing and broluciuzmab overhangs that will likely persist for the near-term,\u201d UBS Securities analyst Carter Gould wrote in a client note.  The quarter was also helped by sales of Dupixent, developed in partnership with Sanofi SA SASY.PA. The companies have massed up approvals for three major diseases for their drug Dupixent including asthma and nasal polyps since the drug was approved in 2017.  Dupixent\u2019s quarterly sales, recorded by Sanofi, rose 166.3% to $557.3 million, handily beating analysts\u2019 consensus of $454 million.  Revenue from the company\u2019s tie-up with Sanofi of $349.1 million also came in ahead of consensus estimates of $306 million.

Participants benefiting from the drug, odronextamab, may continue treatment, the drugmaker said here, if they give their consent.  The U.S. Food and Drugs Administration had placed the trials on partial clinical hold and asked the company to change protocols to reduce the occurrence of an inflammatory response called cytokine release syndrome in patients, according to Regeneron.  The syndrome, caused by a large, rapid release of immune substances called cytokines, may occur after treatment with some types of cancer therapies and can sometimes be severe or fatal. It has different symptoms including fever, headache and troubled breathing, according to the National Cancer Institute.  The company said FDA\u2019s decision impacts an early-stage trial testing odronextamab in cancer patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (B-NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  Another mid-stage trial testing the drug in sub-types of B-NHL will also pause enrollment, Regeneron said.

The European Commission has extended the marketing authorisation for Dupixent in the European Union to include adolescents 12 to 17 years of age with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy, Sanofi and Regeneron said in a joint statement on Tuesday.  Atopic dermatitis, more commonly known as eczema, often leads to skin irritations.

The drugmaker\u2019s shares, down 21 percent this year, fell about 2 percent in mid-day trade on Thursday.  Regeneron is bracing for a hit to Eylea\u2019s sales by focusing on expanding Dupixent\u2019s label to reach more patients and venturing into the hot new field of immuno-oncology with a potential regulatory approval later this year.  \u201cThere are concerns that what happened (with Dupixent) in first quarter could happen again,\u201d SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Yatin Suneja said, adding that there could possibly be an issue with the long term growth potential of the drug.  Dupixent\u2019s quarterly sales of $131 million, reported last week by partner Sanofi, missed estimates of $167.6 million, a worrying sign that the expensive drug might be facing similar issues like the company\u2019s pricey drug Praluent.  Just two days ago, Regeneron and partner Sanofi SA SASY.PA slashed the price on Praluent by more than half for Express Scripts ESRX.O customers, an aggressive attempt to boost sales of the drug.  Praluent earned $60 million in first-quarter revenue, falling short of expectations of $66 million, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  One bright spot for Regeneron was Eylea sales, which rose 15 percent to $984 million, beating estimates of $922.4 million.  While Eylea has driven much of Regeneron's growth for more than seven years, competition from Lucentis, a rival treatment from Roche AG ROG.S and Novartis AG NOVN.S, remain a worry for analysts and investors.  \u201cThere\u2019s even more competition on the horizon for Eylea, so we are looking at Dupixent as a growth driver,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analyst Kennen MacKay said.  The company said it is unlikely to be active in dealmaking and instead will rely on its own drug pipeline even as large drugmakers across the world spend big to acquire nimbler, smaller rivals.  \u201cOur strategy was, and continues to be, to invest heavily in our internal research capabilities rather than look externally for new products,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Leonard Schleifer said on a conference call with analysts.  \u201cWe are not nearly as desperate as other companies are to fill up gaps in the pipeline.\u201d  Regeneron\u2019s net income rose 92 percent to $478 million.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump approaches reporters as he departs on campaign travel to Minnesota from the South Lawn at the White House in Washington, U.S., September 30, 2020. REUTERS\/Carlos Barria  The president's physician, Dr. Sean Conley, said in a statement that Trump \"remains fatigued but in good spirits\" after receiving an intravenous dose of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc's REGN.O dual antibody. Trump was also taking immune system boosters zinc and vitamin D, aspirin, and other generic drugs.  Trump, 74, walked to a helicopter on Friday before being moved to a special suite at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for the next few days.  Regeneron\u2019s drug, REGN-COV2, is part of a class of experimental COVID-19 drugs known as monoclonal antibodies: manufactured copies of human antibodies to the virus that are being studied for use in patients with early illness.  Trump\u2019s doctors \u201cmust be sufficiently concerned with what they are seeing that they decided to use an experimental medicine ... Experimental drugs are by definition risky,\u201d said Dr. Edward Jones-Lopez, infectious disease specialist at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.  Antibodies are proteins made by the body\u2019s immune system that recognize, bind and neutralize an invading virus. Regeneron\u2019s cocktail - which contains an antibody made by the company and a second isolated from humans who recovered from COVID-19 - is designed so that its two antibodies bind to the coronavirus\u2019 spike protein, limiting the ability of viruses to escape.  The technique is already in wide use for treating a range of illnesses. Data so far is limited for COVID-19 antibodies, but U.S. infectious disease chief Dr. Anthony Fauci is among those saying it has promise.  Regeneron this week reported trial results showing that its drug improved symptoms in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with no serious side effects, and said it planned to talk with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about an emergency use authorization.  Eli Lilly & Co LLY.N has also announced encouraging early data from a trial of its coronavirus antibody, and said it is seeking an emergency authorization from the FDA.  Shares of Regeneron rose about 3% in after hours trade, following the announcement that Trump was given the drug.  Trump is also taking the heartburn drug famotidine - often sold in the U.S. under the brand name Pepcid. Although the drug has not been shown to work against COVID-19, researchers are studying it as a possible treatment.  Zinc and vitamin D are believed to boost the immune system. Melatonin is a hormone that helps to regulate daily body rhythms. Trump has said in the past that he takes a daily low-dose aspirin, which is recommended for some adults at increased risk of heart attack or stroke.","25":"SINGAPORE, Jan 27 (Reuters) - COVID-19 antibody drugs developed by Eli Lilly and Co and Regeneron may be weaker against a new coronavirus variant found in South Africa, according to a study released on Tuesday based on laboratory tests.  Scientists have said new variants found in South Africa and Britain seem highly transmissible, raising concern that current drugs and vaccines might be rendered less effective.  The latest study comes as Eli Lily said on Tuesday it is moving a new antibody therapy to clinical trials targeting the South African variant.  The study, which was done outside human bodies using a pseudovirus containing mutations found in the two variants to test antibody treatments, showed the South Africa variant appeared to affect a broader range of antibodies than the U.K. variant and was more worrisome . A pseudovirus mimics live coronavirus and can be handled in labs at lower biosafety levels.  An antibody treatment developed by Lilly saw its neutralising effect severely diminished against the pseudovirus mimicking South African variant, according to the research, which has not yet been peer-reviewed but was published online on BioRxiv, a website for research.  When used in combination with a treatment from Shanghai Junshi Biosciences, its activity against the pseudovirus was still largely crippled, researchers from Columbia University, Vaccine Research Center, Regeneron and others said in the paper released.  But a cocktail of antibody treatments from Regeneron remained potent, although one of the two antibodies showed impaired activity.  The study said its findings suggest that antibody treatment may need to be modified in places where the South Africa variant is prevalent.

Within a month or so of that we will have clear data that this is or isn\u2019t working. By the end of summer, we could have sufficient data for broad utilization.\u201d  Regeneron shares rose about 2% in early trading.  The dual antibody, called REGN-COV2, is being compared with a placebo treatment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and in COVID-19 patients who have symptoms but are not sick enough to be hospitalized. Regeneron also plans to study REGN-COV2 for preventing the infection in people at high-risk of exposure - such as healthcare workers - and in uninfected people with close exposure to someone who has tested positive for the virus.  Antibodies are proteins made by the body\u2019s immune system that recognize, bind and neutralize an invading virus.

Trial patients will be given a single intravenous infusion of REGN-COV2. In the prevention segments of the study, participants will be given smaller subcutaneous doses, Yancopoulus said. Investigators will be measuring patients\u2019 viral loads and keeping track of symptoms.  Regeneron said its treatment could be useful even if a COVID-19 vaccine is developed since the elderly and people with compromised immune systems often do not respond well to vaccines.  Yancopoulos said, even though Regeneron does not yet have proof that REGN-COV2 is effective, the company has cleared the way for production of the antibody compound at its New York manufacturing facility.  Eli Lilly and Co could have a drug specifically designed to treat COVID-19 authorized for use as early as September if all goes well with either of two antibody therapies it is testing, its chief scientist told Reuters on Wednesday.","27":"May 3 (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc on Thursday posted a 92 percent rise in quarterly profit, as demand for its flagship eye treatment Eylea and eczema drug Dupixent increased.

Since the approvals in 2015 of Praluent and a similar rival biotech drug from Amgen Inc, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have been rejecting some 70 percent of prescriptions written, severely holding back sales and frustrating doctors and at-risk heart patients.  Regeneron and Sanofi have decided to focus on patients at highest risk of a repeat heart attack or other major cardiovascular problems likely to derive the most benefit from significant lowering of \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol in an attempt to break the reimbursement logjam.  \u201cWe commit to working with all health plans that agree to remove access barriers for high-risk patients to offer a more cost-effective net price for Praluent,\u201d Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer said in a statement.  \u201cInventing innovative medicines only matters if the people who need these products are able to access them, and that is unfortunately not the case with Praluent today,\u201d he said.  Amgen has offered various strategies in an effort to loosen payer purse strings, such as a willingness to reimburse the drug\u2019s cost if a Repatha patient has a heart attack. But prescription rejections remain high as insurers worry about the cost of long-term treatment for potentially millions of patients.  The new Praluent pricing would be tied to an independent review conducted by an organization that evaluates clinical and cost effectiveness of new medicines and be based on Praluent data unveiled on Saturday, the companies said.  That data, presented at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Orlando, Florida, showed that for patients who have acute coronary syndrome, meaning a recent heart attack or serious chest pain episode, and are unable to get their \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol below 100 despite taking maximum doses of statins, adding Praluent reduced the risk of death.  Based on the new risk-reduction data seen in the huge, multi-year study, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) said an appropriate Praluent price for the highest risk patients would be $4,500 to $8,000 a year.  That is considerably less than the more than $14,000 a year list price and presumably below current net prices with discounts and rebates.  \u201cWe will begin working with payers to ensure that high-risk patients have appropriate access,\u201d Sanofi CEO Olivier Brandicourt said in a statement.","29":"April 16 (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc:  * FDA ACCEPTS FOR PRIORITY REVIEW BIOLOGICS LICENSE APPLICATION FOR REGN-EB3 TO TREAT EBOLA  * REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS INC - TARGET ACTION DATE FOR FDA DECISION IS OCTOBER 25, 2020 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Reuters.Briefs@thomsonreuters.com)","30":"Nov 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Saturday issued an emergency use authorization for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc\u2019s COVID-19 antibody therapy, an experimental treatment given to U.S. President Donald Trump that he said helped cure him of the disease.

The drug, which brought in $922 million in revenue for Sanofi in 2018, gained a U.S. FDA nod last year for use as a maintenance therapy in patients with two forms of asthma.  Piper Jaffray analysts, before the approval, said they expected U.S. sales of $661 million in 2021 from Dupixent\u2019s use in treating adolescents alone.","70":"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc\u2019s cholesterol drug Praluent as a treatment to cut the risk of heart attacks, stroke and other major cardiovascular events.  The FDA\u2019s decision will allow the drug, developed along with Sanofi SA, to be prescribed to reduce the overall risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).  MACE includes heart attack, ischemic stroke, coronary heart disease and unstable chest pains requiring hospitalization.  Praluent belongs to a class of injectable biotech drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors that dramatically lower bad LDL cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart attacks and death.  The FDA also approved Praluent as an adjunct to diet, alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies, for the treatment of adults with primary hyperlipidemia to reduce LDL-C.  In 2015, Praluent was approved in the United States for use as an add-on treatment to statin therapy in adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, a condition that causes cholesterol levels in blood to shoot up. (bit.ly\/1KM8WQf)  Sanofi and Regeneron in February cut the list price of Praluent by 60 percent to match the price of Amgen Inc\u2019s Repatha, another treatment to cut the risk of heart attacks, as the drugmakers try to boost the sales of the drug.  The new list price for Praluent will be $5,850 a year, down from more than $14,000 a year, when it was first approved in 2015.  Sales of both Praluent and Repatha have been severely constrained by roadblocks put up by insurers looking to limit spending on the expensive drugs.  Praluent has been approved in more than 60 countries worldwide, including the U.S., Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Mexico and Brazil, as well as the European Union.","71":"LONDON (Reuters) - The world's largest randomised trial of potential medicines for COVID-19 is to add Regeneron's REGN.O experimental antiviral antibody cocktail REGN-COV2 to the drugs it is testing in patients hospitalised with the disease.  FILE PHOTO: A computer image created by Nexu Science Communication together with Trinity College in Dublin, shows a model structurally representative of a betacoronavirus which is the type of virus linked to COVID-19, better known as the coronavirus linked to the Wuhan outbreak, shared with Reuters on February 18, 2020. NEXU Science Communication\/via REUTERS  The UK RECOVERY trial, which has been testing a range of potential COVID-19 treatments since it began in April, will compare the effects of adding REGN-COV2 - a lab-manufactured monoclonal antibody - to standard care.  \u201cThis is the first drug actually designed for this disease,\u201d said Martin Landray, a professor of medicine & epidemiology at Oxford University who is co-leading the trial.  \u201cThere are lots of good reasons for thinking this might be really quite a powerful treatment,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview.  The addition of Regeneron\u2019s drug to the RECOVERY trial comes amid growing hopes that monoclonal antibodies may emerge as effective ways to treat COVID-19.  Until now, the RECOVERY trial had mostly been studying whether existing drugs could be re-purposed to tackle the new disease, and it has already found answers on a number of them.  In June and September, trial results showed that widely used steroids such as dexamethasone and hydrocortisone were able to reduce death rates among severely-ill COVID-19 patients  Also in June, RECOVERY trial results showed that the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, once touted by U.S. President Donald Trump as a potential \u201cgame changer\u201d in the pandemic, was of no benefit in treating COVID-19 patients.  Regeneron\u2019s REGN-COV2 cocktail, which the company is already testing in late-stage clinical trials in people, combines one Regeneron-made antibody and a second antibody isolated from people who have recovered after being infected with COVID-19.  The combination is designed to bind to the spike protein used by the new coronavirus to gain access to human cells, limiting the virus\u2019s ability to escape.  Regeneron developed the biological drug before linking up with Roche ROG.S to expand its manufacturing capacity in hopes of meeting global demand, should the medicine prove effective. Regeneron would handle U.S. sales, with Roche selling the medicine around the world.  Landray said his team had secured enough supply of the drug so that up to \u201cseveral thousand\u201d patients could be given it in the trial and compared with several thousand controls.  \u201cGiven that the second phase (of COVID-19 infections in the UK) seems to be coming now, it is a really good time to be starting this,\u201d he said.  The United States already has a $450 million deal for the cocktail in place, under the terms of which Regeneron will sell it around 70,000 to 300,000 potential treatment doses or 420,000 to 1.3 million prevention doses of REGN-COV2. Data is due later this month, Regeneron has said.  Alongside Regeneron, Eli Lilly LLY.N, working with biotech firm AbCellera, is seen as a leading contender in the antibody race. In August it started testing whether its antibody can prevent COVID-19 infections in nursing homes. A separate trial testing the compound on recently diagnosed COVID patients may yield initial data in September or shortly after.  GlaxoSmithKline GSK.L and partner Vir Biotechnology VIR.O also began testing an experimental antibody on newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients late last month.  AstraZeneca AZN.L is for now testing its antibody-based cocktail on healthy volunteers for tolerability.","72":"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc said on Monday that the COVID-19 antibody drug combination it is developing both prevented and treated the disease in rhesus macaques and hamsters, adding to hope that it might work for people.

REUTERS\/Alkis Konstantinidis  The U.S. biotech company said in the animal study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, that the cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies was able to \u201calmost completely block establishment of virus infection.\u201d  Regeneron said the cocktail was also able to minimize infection in a second study in which animals were infected with a much higher level of the virus. The prophylactic effect was greatly diminished with a lower dose of the drug, the company said.  It said the results matched or exceeded effects recently shown in animal studies of vaccine candidates.  Effective treatments and vaccines are seen as essential to halting a pandemic that has claimed more than 690,000 lives worldwide.  The infected animals treated with the antibodies cleared the virus faster than those given a placebo, the company said.  The lead researchers said the data suggests the therapy may offer clinical benefit in both prevention and treatment of COVID-19. They also said the animals did not show any signs of increased viral load or worsening of pathology after treatment, an important safety signal that suggests it will not worsen symptoms in humans.  The studies were conducted on a total of 36 rhesus macaques and 50 hamsters. Positive results in animals are no guarantee of success in humans.  Regeneron has already started late-stage clinical trials in humans to assess the antibody treatment\u2019s ability to prevent and treat COVID-19.  The company signed a $450 million contract with the U.S. government as part of its Operation Warp Speed program to provide the United States with the treatment if it succeeds.  Monoclonal antibodies are among the most widely used biotechnology medicines. Eli Lilly and Co and other drugmakers are testing similar treatments against COVID-19.","73":"July 2 (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi said on Thursday their rheumatoid arthritis drug Kevzara failed to meet the main goals of a late-stage study testing it in COVID-19 patients.

The U.S. biotech company is also working to develop a drug made from antibodies from humans and mice that could be used for treatment or prevention of COVID-19, the highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. That could be in clinical trials by June, said Yancopoulos, who co-founded Regeneron with Chief Executive Len Schleifer.  Kevzara belongs to a class of drugs known as interleukin-6 inhibitors that could help regulate an overreaction to the virus by the body\u2019s immune system called a cytokine storm, which may be triggering the respiratory distress seen in severe COVID-19 cases.  Because of that, the drug is being tested on severe cases of the disease, which has killed some 90,000 people and wreaked havoc on economies around the world.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration encouraged Regeneron and Sanofi to combine planned mid- and late-stage clinical trials of Kevzara into a single study to speed the process, Yancopoulos said.  The companies should know if they are a seeing a strong signal on whether the drug works after a few weeks of enrolling patients, he said. The U.S. Kevzara trial started on March 16.  If the drug proves effective, supply should not be an issue, Yancopoulos said, noting that as many as a million doses have already been produced with the capacity to manufacture a lot more.  \u201cThis is treating the small percentage of people who end up being hospitalized and going on ventilators and so forth,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there would be reasonable amounts of drug available.\u201d  BRIDGE TO VACCINE  Meanwhile, Regeneron recently isolated hundreds of virus-neutralizing antibodies from genetically-modified mice and from humans who have recovered from COVID-19 and is working to select the best two candidates for a therapy that might treat and even prevent the disease.  The company used a similar approach to develop a treatment for Ebola. That drug has not yet been fully evaluated by health regulators, but was shown in clinical trials to cut mortality nearly by half.  \u201cIt\u2019s a bridge, ultimately, to the vaccine... something that we can do in the short term,\u201d Yancopoulos said. \u201cWe can maybe do it actually more powerfully than a vaccine can do it, though for a smaller targeted population than a vaccine can reach.\u201d  He said Regeneron is working with the FDA to repurpose its upstate New York manufacturing facility to become totally dedicated to producing drugs for the pandemic. It could make \u201chundreds of thousands, if not on the order of a million doses a month\u201d of the antibody cocktail there.  Other companies have approached Regeneron about helping produce massive quantities of the antibody therapy should it prove effective in preventing COVID-19, Yancopoulos said.  \u201cIf these things work, let\u2019s make sure we can put as much manufacturing capacity as we can on it right now,\u201d he said.","77":"ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche ROG.S is adding its manufacturing muscle and global development expertise to Regeneron's REGN.O bid to create an antibody cocktail for COVID-19 that the Swiss and U.S. companies hope can be used to slow the pandemic.

[nL4N2F72XE] [nL1N2F520D]  Roche has one of the world\u2019s largest antibody production operations, including U.S. facilities in San Francisco, and will boost overall capacity for REGN-COV2 by at least three and a half times, a feat Regeneron would have been hard pressed to accomplish alone.  \u201cThis major collaboration with Roche provides important scale and global expertise to bring REGN-COV2 to many more patients in the United States and around the globe,\u201d Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer said.  Roche\u2019s move to join up with Regeneron comes after its own drug, Actemra, failed in a trial against COVID-19.

[nL2N2EU29C]","78":"(Reuters) - A potent, expensive cholesterol drug sold by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi significantly reduced major adverse heart events in a huge study presented on Saturday but it remains to be seen whether the new data will prompt insurers to pay for increased use of the medicine.  FILE PHOTO: French multinational pharmaceutical company SANOFI logo is seen at the headquarters in Paris, France, March 8, 2016. REUTERS\/Philippe Wojazer\/File Photo  The drug, Praluent, also led to fewer deaths among high-risk patients, which could be the strongest argument for insurers to finally remove barriers that have severely constrained sales and frustrated physicians trying to get the medicine to patients.  Insurers have balked at paying for Praluent and a rival Amgen AMGN.O drug, which dramatically lower \"bad\" LDL cholesterol but carry list prices of more than $14,000 a year before discounts, over fear of the cost of use over many years by millions of patients. They have routinely rejected about 70 percent of prescriptions written, the companies have said.  Regeneron and Sanofi said on Saturday they would lower the net price of Praluent if onerous barriers to its access are removed for the highest-risk patients. That price would be tied to an independent review of Praluent\u2019s value based on the new risk reduction data from the multi-year study called Odyssey Outcomes.  \u201cThe hard data from the Odyssey Outcomes trial confirms ... that treatment with Praluent does lead to a reduction of both cardiovascular and all-cause deaths, particularly for the higher-risk patient population,\u201d said David Whitrap, a spokesman for ICER, which conducted the review. The organization recommended a price range of $4,500 to $8,000 for those high-risk patients likely to gain the most benefit from Praluent therapy.  The study tested the injected biotech drug versus placebo in nearly 19,000 patients who had a recent heart attack or severe chest pain episode and were already on maximum doses of cholesterol-lowering statins, such as Pfizer\u2019s Lipitor.  The trial succeeded on its primary goal - reducing the combined risk of heart attack, stroke, heart disease-related death and chest pain requiring hospitalization - by 15 percent.  While fewer heart-related deaths with Praluent did not reach statistical significance, there was a nominally significant reduction in all-cause deaths - 334 versus 392 for placebo, researchers reported.  In a subgroup analysis of highest-risk patients - those with \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol of 100 or above despite maximum statin therapy - Praluent significantly reduced all-cause death risk by 29 percent and risk of the adverse event composite by 24 percent.  \u201cI think that will impress the field and people who have to make (reimbursement) decisions,\u201d said Dr. Phillippe Steg, the study\u2019s co-chairman who presented the data at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Orlando, Florida.  NOT TRIVIAL  Dr. Valentin Fuster, who critiqued the trial at the meeting but was not involved in the study, said the data show that what is considered normal LDL today may be too high.  \u201cThe results were not trivial,\u201d said Fuster, from Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. \u201cI hope this particular study really is a trigger for making this drug much more available to people who need it.\u201d  Odyssey followed patients on average for 3.3 years and the risk reduction versus placebo was increasing over time.  Some cardiologists believe much longer studies are needed to discover the true value of these drugs.  \u201cIt may take years and years to really reap all the benefits that one can achieve,\u201d study co-chairman Dr. Gregory Schwartz said.  With an LDL target range of 25-50, rather than taking it as low as possible, three-quarters of patients ended up on a lower dose of Praluent and some were taken off the drug if their LDL remained at 15 or lower. It is unclear if benefits would have been more pronounced had more patients received the higher dose.  The drug was deemed extremely safe with no difference from placebo in incidence of neurocognitive problems or new-onset diabetes.","79":"(Reuters) - The U.S. government will buy 1.25 million additional doses of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals\u2019 COVID-19 antibody cocktail for about $2.63 billion, bringing the total supply of the treatment to more than 1.5 million doses.

Demand for these therapies, which are given as a one-time intravenous infusion, has been disappointing. The government program is distributing and allocating the drugs.

REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  BOSTON (Reuters) - It\u2019s nice work if you can get it.  The average annual compensation for non-executive directors at S&P 500 companies rose 2 percent to $304,856 last year, topping $300,000 for the first time and 43 percent higher than it was 10 years ago, according to a new report released by executive headhunters Spencer Stuart.  But thanks largely to stock grants some earned a lot more than that.  Directors at biotechnology company Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc received, on average, $1.2 million in compensation last year. That figure does not include the more than $6 million received by Regeneron\u2019s independent chairman, company disclosures show.  And the non-executive directors of Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs Group Inc made $599,279 on average in 2018, the highest for any financial company in the S&P. That was, though, down from $604,837 in 2017. The investment bank, which had 13 board meetings last year, declined to comment beyond disclosures in its proxy statement.  S&P 500 boards met, on average, just 7.9 times, in person or via telephone, during 2018. That\u2019s down from 9 a decade ago, according to Spencer Stuart.  The bigger payouts are being made at a sensitive time for Corporate America. A top contender for the Democratic presidential nomination for the 2020 election, Elizabeth Warren, has the boardroom in her sights as she seeks to tackle inequality in American society. As well as proposals such as a wealth tax aimed at billionaires, Warren has proposed that workers at U.S. corporations elect at least 40% of board members.  Warren\u2019s campaign declined to comment.  Investors are also taking an increasingly feisty view of directors\u2019 compensation, which is typically set by the board itself. A growing number of shareholder lawsuits are challenging big-ticket board compensation packages.  As a result, more companies are expected to put these matters to a shareholder vote at company annual meetings, said Paul Hodgson, a compensation expert and senior adviser at ESGuage, a corporate governance data and analysis firm.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  \u201cThere\u2019s a certain amount of nervousness within companies about what they\u2019re paying directors,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cMore attention is being paid to outliers than in the past.\u201d  Compensation limits are also becoming more prevalent, with advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis backing demands from some shareholders, according to global risk advisory firm Willis Towers Watson.  A study by the firm found that the number of companies with an annual compensation limit for directors increased to 63% in 2018 from 55% the previous year.  For some, being a director can mean doing as little as attending regularly scheduled meetings.  Board experts say, though, that the job can be a lot more demanding than that. The National Association of Corporate Directors estimates board members commit at least 250 hours a year to their responsibilities.  A director may visit company factories and offices, read and comment on background papers, and is often involved in board committee work. Regeneron director Christine Poon, for example, participated in 21 meetings last year, including 10 as chair of the compensation committee.  Directors at software developer Roper Technologies Inc, who on average received nearly $910,000 in 2018, participate in at least 15 days of board meetings a year, according to the company\u2019s proxy filing. That works out at over $60,000 per day.  Roper says the compensation reflects their contribution to the company\u2019s superior performance - a cumulative return of 1,084% over the past 15 years compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 207%, according to the proxy.  Roper did not return email and calls seeking comment.  Some companies are proud to be miserly. Microsoft Corp founder Bill Gates received just $3,300 last year for his work as a director of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, which is run by fellow billionaire Warren Buffett.  And directors at fashion company Ralph Lauren Corp received nearly all of their pay in cash in 2018, and made a lot less than their peers, pulling down just $107,299, according to Spencer Stuart. At some companies, there is a delay in directors receiving the full benefit of their service. That is the case at Goldman, whose directors don\u2019t receive shares from their restricted stock grants until they retire.  Smaller, lesser known biopharmaceutical companies can offer the biggest compensation packages.  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc awards a $400,000 restricted stock grant to directors that vests after one year. It\u2019s the key feature in a package that averaged $613,128 per director last year. Vertex did not return messages seeking comment.  Regeneron Chairman Roy Vagelos received $6.35 million in 2018, benefiting from big stock option awards, and that was down from $11.8 million in 2017.  Regeneron, known for drugs that treat eye disease, held six board meetings in 2018. Vagelos, a former CEO of Merck & Co Inc, attended all of those as well as three technology committee meetings.  \u201cThe quality of our board is unparalleled \u2013 over half our directors are members of the National Academy of Sciences and two of our directors are Nobel laureates,\u201d said Regeneron spokeswoman Alexandra Bowie when asked about the compensation  Last year, though, Regeneron did agree to curb its director pay as part of a settlement with investors who sued the company, claiming Vagelos and other directors received excessive compensation.  A new compensation plan in effect this year has resulted in a nearly 50% year-over-year decrease in the reported value of director stock awards on the day they were granted. That will probably start to be reflected in 2019 numbers.  Pharmaceutical company Incyte Corp, whose board members made an average of $493,657 in 2018, also re-evaluated the way it structured directors\u2019 compensation after getting investors\u2019 push back.  Incyte eliminated grants that fixed the number of shares given to directors at the same level each year. When the shares climbed this immediately gave them a year-on-year windfall.  The company now makes annual stock grants based on a target dollar value. Incyte also discontinued an enhanced initial grant of stock for new directors.  \u201cThese changes make our board compensation consistent with other companies,\u201d Incyte spokeswoman Catalina Loveman said.","89":"Feb 4 (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc is working with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop a treatment for the coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 400 people in China, the HHS said on Tuesday.

The experimental therapy has also entered into mid-to-late stage phase of two trials testing its effectiveness in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients, preliminary data of which is expected later this summer. Human testing of the therapy began in June.  Regeneron is among the few front-runners that have begun human trials testing their experimental therapies to fight COVID-19, including Gilead Sciences GILD.O, Eli Lilly LLY.N and AbbVie ABBV.N.

Since the approvals in 2015 of Praluent and a similar rival biotech drug from Amgen Inc, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have been rejecting some 70 percent of prescriptions written, severely holding back sales and frustrating doctors and at-risk heart patients.  Regeneron and Sanofi have decided to focus on patients at highest risk of a repeat heart attack or other major cardiovascular problems likely to derive the most benefit from significant lowering of \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol in an attempt to break the reimbursement logjam.  \u201cWe commit to working with all health plans that agree to remove access barriers for high-risk patients to offer a more cost-effective net price for Praluent,\u201d Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer said in a statement.  \u201cInventing innovative medicines only matters if the people who need these products are able to access them, and that is unfortunately not the case with Praluent today,\u201d he said.  Amgen has offered various strategies in an effort to loosen payer purse strings, such as a willingness to reimburse the drug\u2019s cost if a Repatha patient has a heart attack. But prescription rejections remain high as insurers worry about the cost of long-term treatment for potentially millions of patients.  The new Praluent pricing would be tied to an independent review conducted by an organization that evaluates clinical and cost effectiveness of new medicines and be based on Praluent data unveiled on Saturday, the companies said.  That data, presented at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Orlando, Florida, showed that for patients who have acute coronary syndrome, meaning a recent heart attack or serious chest pain episode, and are unable to get their \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol below 100 despite taking maximum doses of statins, adding Praluent reduced the risk of death.  Based on the new risk-reduction data seen in the huge, multi-year study, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) said an appropriate Praluent price for the highest risk patients would be $4,500 to $8,000 a year.  That is considerably less than the more than $14,000 a year list price and presumably below current net prices with discounts and rebates.  \u201cWe will begin working with payers to ensure that high-risk patients have appropriate access,\u201d Sanofi CEO Olivier Brandicourt said in a statement.

Eli Lilly\u2019s combination therapy of two antibodies, bamlanivimab and etesevimab, helped cut the risk of hospitalization and death in COVID-19 patients by 70%, data from a late-stage trial showed in January.  Regeneron\u2019s cocktail of casirivimab and imdevimab was authorised for emergency use in the United States in November, and was given to former U.S. President Donald Trump during his COVID-19 infection.  The four drugs are combinations of a class of medicines called monoclonal antibody treatments, or manufactured copies of antibodies created by the human body to fight infections.  The EMA also said it was studying the use of Lilly's bamlanivimab as a singular therapy. The drug has already received emergency use approval in high-risk patients in the United States with mild to moderate COVID-19. (bit.ly\/39NmGP0)  Any recommendations made by the EMA\u2019s human medicine\u2019s committee will have to be formally approved by the European Commission.","98":"(Reuters) - Results of a study of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA\u2019s rheumatoid arthritis drug Kevzara indicate it may only help the sickest coronavirus patients, the companies said on Monday, dampening hopes the medicine could benefit a wider group of those infected.  FILE PHOTO: The ultrastructural morphology exhibited by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China, is seen in an illustration released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. January 29, 2020. Alissa Eckert, MS; Dan Higgins, MAM\/CDC\/Handout via REUTERS.  The drugmakers said they would continue to test high doses of Kevzara only in those who are considered critically ill with COVID-19, the disease caused by the highly contagious virus. The decision was based on guidance from an independent committee that reviewed early trial data, which showed it did not help patients deemed severely ill.  Patients who required mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy or treatment in an intensive care unit were considered critically ill. Those who required oxygen without mechanical or high-flow oxygenation were considered severely ill.  There are currently no approved treatments specifically for the novel coronavirus, so drugmakers are rushing to test existing medicines as well as experimental therapies in the hope that something will help alter the course of the illness that has infected more than 3 million people and killed over 208,000 worldwide.  Regeneron co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer George Yancopoulos said he was skeptical about the prospect of drugs like Kevzara that were not designed to treat COVID-19. Drugs currently in late stage testing for the virus, like Gilead Science\u2019s remdesivir, were developed for other diseases.  \u201cRepurposing a drug and finding it to be very effective for a new indication is an exception, as opposed to the rule,\u201d Yancopoulos said. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very rare where those have really turned into important drugs for whole new indication.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough to design a drug and get it to work,\u201d he added.  Regeneron has identified hundreds of virus-neutralizing antibodies and is working to select the best two candidates for a \u201ccocktail\u201d therapy that might treat and even prevent COVID-19, with the expectation of starting human trials in June.  Kevzara belongs to a class of drugs called interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors that could help regulate a dangerous overreaction to the virus by the body\u2019s immune system called a \u201ccytokine storm,\u201d which may be triggering the respiratory distress seen in severe COVID-19 cases.  Early analysis of the study showed Kevzara rapidly lowered levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation. However, the companies reported negative trends for most \u201cseverely\u201d ill patients given the drug, while there were positive trends in the critically ill group.  Researchers were looking for reductions in risk of death and need for a ventilator, as well as clinical improvements such as ability to come off oxygen therapy or be discharged from the hospital. Those who received the higher tested dose of Kevzara (400 milligrams) appeared to fare better among the critically ill group.  Dr. Kevin Tracey, head of research at New York hospital group Northwell Health which participated in the trial, cautioned against drawing strong conclusions on the use of IL-6 inhibitors for COVID-19.  Different compounds that work similarly could be more effective, he said in a phone interview, noting that rheumatoid arthritis treatments from another class of drugs may help one patient with the condition but not another.  \u201cScientifically, we don\u2019t know why,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t draw any conclusions negatively or positively until the results of the randomized clinical trials are in of the particular agents.\u201d  Also on Monday, French researchers said Roche Holding AG\u2019s IL-6 inhibitor Actemra significantly reduced the risk of death and the number of patients needing a ventilator in a study 129 COVID-19 patients.

Regeneron did not give any reason for the change in its statement on Friday.  The go-ahead was based on second-year data from the so-called VIEW 1 and 2 trials, showing patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) can be treated with a modified 12-week dosing schedule.  Eylea is currently approved in wet AMD for dosing intervals of every four or eight weeks after three initial monthly doses.  Regeneron\u2019s Partner Bayer, for its part, earlier this month won approval in Europe for Eylea also to be injected less frequently.  This could be a relief for patients of wet AMD, the leading cause of blindness in the elderly, as the drug is given as injections into the eye.  In November, Novartis\u2019s rival eye drug brolucizumab, also known as RTH258, was shown to lead to less disease activity than Eylea. According to previous study results, brolucizumab could be injected less frequently than Eylea.  Regeneron sells the drug in the U.S. and Bayer in the rest of the world. Wet AMD leads to abnormal blood vessels that leak fluid into the eye and cause blindness.  Regeneron reported 2017 U.S. revenue of $3.7 billion from the drug.

Two separate reviews will be carried out to see if patients with COVID-19, who do not need oxygen support and are at high risk of their condition worsening, can be treated with these drugs, the European Medicines Agency said. (Reporting by Pushkala Aripaka in Bengaluru; Editing by Ramakrishnan M.)","117":"Oct 7 (Reuters) - Patients are asking to join clinical trials of antibody-based COVID-19 drugs after U.S. President Donald Trump was treated last week with an experimental therapy from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, and on Wednesday he promised to make it free to Americans while touting its benefits.  Medical experts said more data is needed to assess the treatment\u2019s efficacy before wider use should be allowed.  Trump was discharged from the hospital late on Monday, just a few days after being diagnosed with COVID-19 that caused enough lung inflammation for blood oxygen levels to fall.  According to his doctor, blood tests on Monday detected infection-fighting antibodies, which a Regeneron spokesperson said were probably from the treatment.  In a video shot outside the White House, Trump credited the Regeneron therapy for his feeling much better than when he was first diagnosed and said he would push for emergency use authorizations (EUA) of that treatment and others like it. He mistakenly said the drug was called Regeneron.  Regeneron said it was talking with the U.S. Food and Administration about an EUA for its cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies - manufactured copies of antibodies that are one of the main weapons the immune system generates to fight infections.  The company so far has released some early data pointing to the promise of its therapy for COVID-19, and doctors were concerned Trump\u2019s treatment and subsequent promotion could put pressure on regulators  Dr. Gary Kleiner, a pediatric immunologist at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and investigator in a trial designed to see if Regeneron\u2019s antibodies can prevent coronavirus infection, said he has been approached by patients seeking the drug since last week.  Dr. Dirk Sostman, head of the research network at Houston Methodist Hospital, a trial site for Regeneron and Eli Lilly & Co antibody programs, said more patients are asking to participate in an antibody trial.  He was cautious about broader use without more data.  \u201cAll we have seen are very brief press releases ... so there is not much to go on,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe politics of the situation would suggest to me that the story could be Trump gets COVID ... then American technology fostered by the Trump Administration cures COVID,\u201d Sostman added. \u201cI would think there would be pressure on regulators.\u201d  Top U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, speaking on Monday on CNN, said he was \u201cstrongly suspicious\u201d that Regeneron\u2019s drug has contributed to Trump\u2019s progress.  \u201cObviously you can\u2019t prove that until you do a number of studies to show that it actually works,\u201d he said.  Doctors emphasized that the timeline for Trump\u2019s illness was not entirely clear. \u201cIf he is responding at a pace where he is truly much better, it is going to be due to the antibodies,\u201d said Dr. Edward Jones-Lopez, infectious disease specialist at the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine in Los Angeles.  Giving the treatment to the president seems \u201ca tacit endorsement by the federal medical bureaucracy for Regeneron\u2019s medicine, and we expect an EUA for the treatment of COVID in a matter of days,\u201d Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a research note.  \u201cPatients most likely to benefit from this treatment have a similar profile to President Trump, in that they had undetectable antibodies at baseline and were early in the course of disease,\u201d Regeneron spokeswoman Alexandra Bowie said in an emailed statement.  Regeneron has received $450 million from the U.S. government for up to 300,000 doses of the dual-antibody cocktail, and the company has said those supplies would be distributed free of charge.  Eli Lilly on Wednesday said a mid-stage trial testing its combination antibody therapy showed that it helped cut hospitalization and emergency room visits for COVID-19 patients and that it also planned to seek an EUA.  Shares of Regeneron, up nearly 6% so far this month, closed at $591.69 on Wednesday. Lilly\u2019s shares rose 3.4% on Wednesday to close at $148.96.

The companies said enrolments for the mid-to-late stage trial of Kevzara, an immune-system modifying drug known as a monoclonal antibody, have now started in Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Canada, and Russia. The U.S. trials began last week.  The trial, expected to enroll about 300 patients, will recruit hospitalized patients from several countries who are severely or critically ill with COVID-19 infection, a disease caused by the highly contagious coronavirus.  The new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV2, has now infected more than 700,000 people worldwide, and over 30,000 people have died from it, according to a Reuters tally.  Doctors have seen that many of those who become critically ill from SARS-CoV2 are experiencing a so-called cytokine storm, which happens when the immune system overreacts and attacks the body\u2019s organs. Some researchers think drugs that can suppress the immune system, including monoclonal antibodies, might be useful for limiting this autoimmune response.  The United States has the most reported cases of any country in the world, with more than 130,000 cases of COVID-19.  Italy and Spain have been two of the worst-hit countries in Europe, recording the highest and the second highest death toll from coronavirus of any country in the world, respectively.  Regeneron is leading the U.S. trials, while Sanofi is leading trials outside the U.S.","120":"(Reuters) - President Donald Trump has been treated with an experimental antibody cocktail for COVID-19 and is moving to a military hospital as a precautionary measure, White House officials said on Friday.  The president\u2019s physician, Dr. Sean Conley, said in a statement that Trump \u201cremains fatigued but in good spirits\u201d after receiving an intravenous dose of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc\u2019s dual antibody. Trump was also taking immune system boosters zinc and vitamin D, aspirin, and other generic drugs.  Trump, 74, walked to a helicopter on Friday before being moved to a special suite at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for the next few days.  Regeneron\u2019s drug, REGN-COV2, is part of a class of experimental COVID-19 drugs known as monoclonal antibodies: manufactured copies of human antibodies to the virus that are being studied for use in patients with early illness.  Trump\u2019s doctors \u201cmust be sufficiently concerned with what they are seeing that they decided to use an experimental medicine ... Experimental drugs are by definition risky,\u201d said Dr. Edward Jones-Lopez, infectious disease specialist at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.  Antibodies are proteins made by the body\u2019s immune system that latch onto and neutralize an invading virus. Regeneron\u2019s cocktail - which contains an antibody made by the company and a second isolated from humans who recovered from COVID-19 - is designed so that its two antibodies bind to the coronavirus\u2019 spike protein, limiting the ability of viruses to escape.  \u201cThe trouble is we don\u2019t have good treatments for people with mild COVID-19 ... I imagine that they are doing this because they hope this is relatively low risk,\u201d said Dr. Rajesh Gandhi, an infectious disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Data so far is limited for COVID-19 antibodies, but U.S. infectious disease chief Dr. Anthony Fauci is among those saying the technology has promise.  Regeneron this week reported trial results showing that its drug improved symptoms in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with no serious side effects, and said it planned to talk with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about an emergency use authorization.  Eli Lilly & Co has also announced encouraging early data from a trial of its coronavirus antibody, and said it is seeking emergency authorization from the FDA.  Shares of Regeneron rose about 3% in after hours trade, following the announcement that Trump was given the drug.  Trump is also taking the heartburn drug famotidine - often sold in the U.S. under the brand name Pepcid. Although the drug has not been shown to work against COVID-19, researchers are studying it as a possible treatment.  Zinc and vitamin D are believed to boost the immune system. Melatonin is a hormone that helps to regulate daily body rhythms. Trump has said in the past that he takes a daily low-dose aspirin, which is recommended for some adults at increased risk of heart attack or stroke.","121":"May 29 (Reuters) - Sanofi\/Regeneron:  * Libtayo\u00ae (cemiplimab-rwlc) longer-term results in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma presented at ASCO 2020 show durable responses that deepen over time  * These results demonstrate both longer durability and higher complete response (CR) rates than previously reported.

FILE PHOTO: An Amgen sign is seen at the company's office in South San Francisco, California October 21, 2013. REUTERS\/Robert Galbraith  The justices declined to hear Amgen\u2019s appeal seeking reinstatement of a jury verdict it won against Regeneron and Sanofi in the dispute in which Amgen accused its rivals of infringing its patents relating to its competing drug Repatha and sought to block sales of Praluent.  Amgen had asked the justices to overturn a 2017 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that set aside the jury\u2019s verdict, nullified a ban imposed by a judge on Praluent sales and ordered a new trial. The sales ban was put on hold while the matter was on appeal, never taking effect.  Sanofi and Regeneron said in a joint statement they were pleased with the Supreme Court\u2019s action.  \u201cWe are confident that the law and the facts support our positions,\u201d the companies said, adding that they look forward to the next trial in federal court in Delaware that is scheduled to start on Feb. 19.  Amgen said in a statement it believed in the validity of its patents and was preparing for the new trial.  Praluent is an injectable drug approved by the FDA in 2015 to treat high cholesterol in patients whose cholesterol levels were not controlled by diet and statin treatment. It is created from antibodies that dramatically lower levels of \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol in the blood by blocking a certain protein.  Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen sued Regeneron and Sanofi in 2014. A jury returned a verdict in 2016 that Amgen\u2019s patents relating to Repatha were valid. Paris-based Sanofi and Tarrytown, New York-based Regeneron had stipulated that if the patents were valid Praluent had infringed them.  In January 2018, U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson in Delaware took the unusual step of ordering an end to sales of Praluent. Robinson found that, although having both drugs on the market would be in the public interest, Amgen\u2019s patent rights outweighed that concern.  Praluent and Repatha won U.S. approval to reduce LDL cholesterol and have been shown to lower the risk of heart attacks. The drugs are far more costly than other cholesterol drugs, with a list price topping $14,000 annually.","123":"Aug 6 (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue on Tuesday, boosted by demand for its blockbuster eye drug, Eylea.

The ruling from U.S. District Judge Richard Andrews in Wilmington, Delaware was the latest reversal of fortune in a long-running lawsuit in which Amgen is seeking to stop French drugmaker Sanofi and U.S. biotech Regeneron from selling their drug Praluent.  Repatha and Praluent won U.S. approval about two weeks apart in July of 2016. Both drugs dramatically lower \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol by blocking a protein known as PCSK9 that prevents LDL removal from the blood. The injected drugs were later shown to also cut the risk of heart attacks.  The judge, in setting aside the jury\u2019s verdict reached in February, said some patent claims by Amgen relating to antibodies targeting PCSK9 were invalid because they did not sufficiently disclose the Thousand Oaks, California-based company\u2019s claimed innovations.  \u201cIt has been our longstanding belief that all of Amgen\u2019s asserted U.S. PCSK9 patent claims are invalid, and we are pleased that today\u2019s decision reaffirms this,\u201d Sanofi and Regeneron said in a statement.  California-based Amgen said in a statement that it disagreed with aspects of the court\u2019s decision and will seek review by the appellate court.  \u201cProtecting intellectual property is critical to our business since it allows for our investment in the research and development of new medicines,\u201d Amgen said. \u201cConsequently, we are disappointed with today\u2019s decision, and we look forward to presenting our case to uphold the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d  Despite initial forecasts for multibillion-dollar sales, restrictions placed by insurers on use of the potent but expensive drugs have severely limited patient access and sales.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc said on Tuesday its antibody cocktail was found effective in preventing COVID-19 in people exposed to those infected with the new coronavirus in an ongoing late stage trial.  The two-antibody cocktail, REGEN-COV, caused a 100% reduction in symptomatic infection and roughly 50% lower overall rates of infection, based on an early analysis of 400 participants in the trial who had a household member with COVID-19.  In comparison, rival Eli Lilly and Co said last week its antibody drug, bamlanivimab, cut the risk of COVID-19 infection by 80% for nursing home residents in a trial.  Regeneron said it would discuss the interim results with U.S. health regulators to potentially expand the antibody cocktail\u2019s current emergency use authorization (EUA). Full data from the trial is expected early in the second quarter.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in November granted EUA to the antibody cocktail for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and children.  The current trial tested REGEN-COV for use as a passive vaccine, which involves direct delivery of virus-fighting antibodies into the body unlike traditional vaccines in which the receiver\u2019s immune system is activated to develop its own antibodies.  \u201cThese data using REGEN-COV as a passive vaccine suggest that it may both reduce transmission of the virus as well as reduce viral and disease burden in those who still get infected,\u201d said George Yancopoulos, president and chief scientific officer of Regeneron.  During the trial, jointly run by Regeneron and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, one death and a COVID-19 related hospitalization were reported among those who received placebo, but there was no such incident in the treatment group, the company said.","127":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc said on Monday that they will slash the U.S. list price of their potent but expensive cholesterol fighter Praluent by 60 percent, as the drugmakers follow a similar move by rival Amgen Inc in hopes of increasing use of the drug.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Sanofi is pictured during the Viva Tech start-up and technology summit in Paris, France, May 25, 2018. REUTERS\/Charles Platiau  The new list price for Praluent will be $5,850 a year, matching the price Amgen set when it lowered the list of its competing drug, Repatha, in October.  Sanofi and Regeneron said they expect the lower-priced Praluent to be available for pharmacies to order in early March. They said the new price should improve patient access and result in lower out-of-pocket costs for U.S. consumers.  Praluent and Repatha belong a class of injectable biotech drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors that dramatically lower bad LDL cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart attacks and death.  Sales of both have been severely constrained by onerous roadblocks to patient access put up by insurers looking to limit spending on the expensive drugs.  They were approved in 2015 with initial list prices of more than $14,000 a year.  In March of last year, Regeneron and Sanofi said that they would be willing to charge less for their drug if insurers agreed to reduce barriers for high-risk heart patients.  A few months later they struck a deal with Express Scripts, now part of Cigna Corp, to make the drug available to that company\u2019s customers at a price in the range of $4,500 to $6,600 a year.  The United States, which leaves drug pricing to market competition, has higher prices than in other developed countries, where governments directly or indirectly control costs. That makes it by far the world\u2019s most lucrative market for manufacturers.  Congress has been targeting the pharmaceutical industry over the rising cost of prescription drugs for U.S. consumers, particularly since Democrats took over the House of Representatives in January.  Executives from at least six drugmakers plan to testify at a Senate hearing on rising prescription drug prices later this month.  Drug pricing is also a top priority of the administration of President Donald Trump, who had made it a central issue of the 2016 presidential campaign.","128":"(Adds Regeneron comment, share price)  Oct 24 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc, looking to boost use of its potent cholesterol drug Repatha, has cut the medication\u2019s U.S. list price by 60 percent to $5,850, the biotechnology company said on Wednesday.  Repatha and rival drug Praluent from partners Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA were launched in 2015 at list prices of more than $14,000 a year.  Sales of both - injectable drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors that dramatically lower bad LDL cholesterol - have been constrained by onerous roadblocks to patient access by insurers looking to limit spending on the expensive drugs.  Amgen\u2019s move \u201cis clearly focused on helping patients afford the medicine at the pharmacy counter,\u201d said Murdo Gordon, the company\u2019s head of commercial operations.  He said the drug, which has been shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks in high-risk patients, needs to be affordable to patients on Medicare, the federal government\u2019s health plan for seniors.  Amgen and other drugmakers have assistance programs to cover co-pays and deductibles for patients covered by commercial insurance, but are barred by law from paying those costs for people on government-funded health plans.  The new $5,850 price is in line with the current net price Amgen gets after discounts and rebates to pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and health insurers, said Amgen spokeswoman Kristen Davis.  In May, Regeneron and Sanofi agreed with pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co to lower Praluent\u2019s price to between $4,500 and $8,000 in exchange for easier access for patients covered by the PBM\u2019s largest plan.  \u201cWe are glad to see that Amgen is following our lead in lowering the cost of PCSK9 inhibitors,\u201d Regeneron said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.  Express Scripts still lists Regeneron\u2019s drug as the preferred PCSK9 option under its largest plan, but said on Wednesday it may \u201cre-evaluate based on Amgen\u2019s update.\u201d  \u201cAmgen is taking an important step forward to help payers be better positioned to provide breakthrough medicines and help people achieve better outcomes,\u201d Express Scripts\u2019 Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in a statement.  Amgen estimates that 75 percent of Repatha prescriptions under Medicare are not filled due to high out-of-pocket costs.  Gordon said Amgen expects that with the new lower list price for Repatha, Medicare Part D plans will list the drug with a fixed co-pay, rather than require patients to cover a percentage of the drug\u2019s price as most now do.  He said nearly half of the 3.4 million Americans estimated to be eligible for treatment with Repatha are on Medicare. Currently, the drug is being used by around 50,000 patients worldwide, Amgen said.  \u201cIn the long term it is our hope that we can address more patient needs, leading ultimately to higher revenue,\u201d Gordon said.  Despite initial forecasts for multibillion-dollar sales, worldwide sales of Repatha totaled just $271 million in the first half of 2018. Sales of Praluent were $134 million in the same period.  Amgen said the new list price will take affect immediately for most Repatha sales, and said the drug sold under the original list price will be phased out by the end of 2020 in order to limit any disruption to existing contracts.  The company said it has been offering healthcare payers significant rebates this year in exchange for improved patient access to Repatha.  Gordon said Amgen may continue to offer rebates to some PBMs and insurers. \u201cIf plans are interested in moving to affordable, fixed co-pay tiers, we are not going to be slow to respond to them,\u201d he said.

Fresenius Medical Care, the largest kidney dialysis provider in the United States, said it plans to begin administering the intravenous treatments nationwide this week at facilities dedicated to handling COVID-19 patients or during shifts set up for only those patients.  Smaller dialysis provider U.S. Renal Care said it will begin this week to dispense bamlanivimab, Eli Lilly and Co\u2019s antibody drug, to its patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19.  Timely use of the treatment could help reduce hospital admissions, said Mary Dittrich, the dialysis company\u2019s chief medical officer.  Some doctors have questioned the efficacy of the new treatments, which in any case are complicated to use, taking two hours to infuse and monitor a patient.

When they are it is typically in environments where compromised patients might be,\u201d said Michael Ganio, senior director of pharmacy practice at the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.  Nearly 500,000 people in the United States are on dialysis, a process of mechanically cleaning blood usually done three times a week. Diabetes is the most common cause of kidney failure.  Bamlanivimab and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc\u2019s cocktail of casirivimab and imdevimab have the U.S. government\u2019s emergency authorization for non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients who are at high risk of becoming severely ill.  St. John Well Child and Family Center, a non-profit clinic serving low-income families in South and Central Los Angeles, has re-purposed an idled dental office and expects this week to administer the antibody infusion treatments to as many as 18 people a day.  Some hospitals are also opening their own infusion sites separate from vulnerable populations, including cancer patients.  \u201cWe have set up an alternate infusion site,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious disease at Nashville\u2019s Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \u201cNot everybody wants it.

The federal government has multi-million dollar contracts with both Lilly and Regeneron for supplies of the antibody therapies.  U.S. Renal Care said it will initially take delivery of bamlanivimab at 16 clinics in California, Georgia, Hawaii, Maryland, New Mexico, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas.  Vanderbilt\u2019s Schaffner said many hospitals are grappling with a surge of \u201cvery sick\u201d patients at the same time they are launching campaigns to inoculate staff with new COVID-19 vaccines.  \u201cThe vaccination program is priority one,\u201d he said.","135":"June 1 (Reuters) - Intellia Therapeutics Inc:  * REGENERON AND INTELLIA THERAPEUTICS EXPAND COLLABORATION TO DEVELOP CRISPR\/CAS9-BASED TREATMENTS  * INTELLIA THERAPEUTICS INC - REGENERON AND INTELLIA TO CO-DEVELOP POTENTIAL HEMOPHILIA A AND B TREATMENTS  * INTELLIA THERAPEUTICS INC - REGENERON GAINS RIGHTS TO DEVELOP PRODUCTS FOR ADDITIONAL IN VIVO TARGETS AND NEW RIGHTS FOR EX VIVO PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT  * INTELLIA THERAPEUTICS INC - INTELLIA RECEIVES $100 MILLION THROUGH UPFRONT CASH AND EQUITY INVESTMENT FROM REGENERON  * INTELLIA THERAPEUTICS - EXISTING COLLABORATION WITH REGENERON EXTENDED UNTIL APRIL 2024, WITH REGENERON HAVING OPTION TO RENEW FOR ADDITIONAL 2 YEARS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","136":"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA will slash the price of their expensive cholesterol drug for Express Scripts Holdings Co customers in exchange for greater patient access, with some savings to be shared with consumers, the companies said on Tuesday.  FILE PHOTO: French multinational pharmaceutical company SANOFI logo is seen at the headquarters in Paris, France, March 8, 2016. REUTERS\/Philippe Wojazer\/\/File Photo  The drug, Praluent, has a list price of over $14,000 a year, but the new price, after discounts and double-digit rebates, is on the \u201clow end\u201d of a $4,500 to $6,600 range, Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller told Reuters.  That range was determined in March to be cost effective by the independent Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) for highest risk patients assuming the drug results in a sustained reduction in cardiovascular-related deaths.  Praluent, given by injection, dramatically lowers bad LDL cholesterol and reduces the risk of heart attacks and death in high-risk heart patients.  But sales of Praluent and a rival Amgen drug have been constrained by onerous roadblocks to patient access by insurers. They reject about 70 percent of prescriptions written, the companies have said.  \u201cI expect this to substantially increase the sales,\u201d Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer said of the deal.  But investors are less certain that big price concessions will result in an overall sales increase. Amgen shares were off 3.3 percent, or $5.81, at $168.67 while Regeneron shares fell 2.5 percent, or $7.59 to $296.09.  The new arrangement makes Praluent exclusive on the Express Scripts\u2019 national formulary for the drug class known as PCSK9 inhibitors, meaning some customers of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) will not easily access Amgen\u2019s Repatha.  Express Scripts, the nation\u2019s largest manager of pharmacy benefit plans (PBM), said about 25 million people, or a third of its customers, are covered by the preferred formulary.  Miller said in a telephone interview that the new Praluent price includes \u201cpoint of sale\u201d discounts for consumers. Beginning in July, Express Scripts will pass along a portion of Praluent rebates it receives from the drugmakers to people in eligible health benefit plans, lowering out-of-pocket costs.  \u201cThis is a significant (price) reduction that the patients will also feel, not just the insurance companies or the employers,\u201d Schleifer told Reuters by telephone.  The Trump administration and members of Congress have demanded that PBMs pass on more of the rebates they receive to consumers outraged over rising costs at the pharmacy counter. Many Americans now have health plans with higher deductibles or co-payments, making them responsible for more of their medical costs.  Other insurers and PBMs, including UnitedHealth, and CVS Health, have announced plans to return at least some prescription drug rebates back to consumers.  Amgen said the formulary decision impacts 2,000 Repatha patients out of the 39,000 people who take the drug. It said it has been negotiating with several payers and that it will fight to be included in other Express Scripts business, and that it is offering significant discounts.  Regeneron and Sanofi said in March they would be willing to lower Praluent\u2019s price in exchange for easier patient access.  Beginning July 1, doctors can submit just one form attesting that a patient with heart disease meets criteria for PCSK9 therapy, such as inability to sufficiently lower LDL with cheap statins, like generic versions of Pfizer\u2019s Lipitor.  Regeneron\u2019s CEO said talks were taking place with other insurers and PBMs about similar arrangements.  \u201cI hope that this will spread like wildfire through the entire payer system,\u201d Schleifer said.","137":"PARIS (Reuters) - The rheumatoid arthritis drug Kevzara has failed as a COVID-19 treatment, French drugmaker Sanofi said on Tuesday following a similar flop of a Roche product.

The company has said that clinical trial data shows the drug reduced medical visits in patients with mild-to-moderate cases. The antibody treatment would be the first drug designed specifically to fight COVID-19 and could become a tool in the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than one million people globally.  Based on clinical trials, Regeneron expects emergency use authorization could be granted for outpatients, a group that it believes would benefit the most from the drug.  About 80,000 doses of the treatment could be ready by the end of this month, and 300,000 doses by the end of January, Regeneron said.  The company has been working to scale up production of the drug, and raised its forecast for 2020 research and development expenses to between $2.75 billion and $2.82 billion, from its prior forecast of $2.61 billion and $2.73 billion. It would also result in higher expenses in the first half of 2021.

The government program is distributing and allocating the drugs.  Healthcare systems say they have been slow to ramp up use of the antibodies due to extra levels of complexity during the pandemic - including requirements for quick diagnosis times and the need to isolate infectious patients.  Utah\u2019s Intermountain Healthcare said it has trained a special team, known as \u201cthe MAb Squad,\u201d who contact high-risk patients as soon as their test results are positive to connect them with treatment at infusion centers across the state.  Lilly\u2019s bamlanivimab and Regeneron\u2019s combination of casirivimab and imdevimab are monoclonal antibodies, known as MAbs in medical shorthand, manufactured copies of proteins produced by the body to fight coronavirus infection.  Both treatments have U.S. emergency use authorization for newly-diagnosed, non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients at risk of becoming severely ill due to age or underlying health conditions.  The Regeneron cocktail was among the medicines used to treat U.S. President Donald Trump when he contracted COVID-19.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has so far delivered over 250,000 doses of the drugs to states and territories. The latest weekly statistics from HHS show that only 21% of delivered drug was used to treat patients, Michael Ganio, senior director of pharmacy practice and quality at the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, told Reuters.  He said that number is rising as hospitals open dedicated infusion centers - some in conference rooms and auditoriums. HHS plans to set up a website where a user can type in a zip code and find a nearby site able to administer an infusion.  \u201cWe are using quite a bit. We\u2019ve treated over 300 patients so far with bamlanivimab,\u201d said Katherine Perez, infectious disease pharmacist at Houston Methodist.  Perez said Houston Methodist is mainly using bamlanivimab as Regeneron\u2019s drug is still being distributed using material from clinical trials, requiring pharmacies to mix several vials.  \u201cSometimes it takes eight vials to get one dose,\u201d she said.

U.S. officials on a call with reporters said doses will be allocated based on which states have the highest numbers of confirmed cases and hospitalizations, both of which are currently soaring nationwide.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Saturday issued emergency use authorization for the treatment called REGN-COV2, which combines two monoclonal antibodies, to be used for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and children who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19.

Trump was discharged from the hospital late on Monday, just a few days after being diagnosed with COVID-19 that caused enough lung inflammation for blood oxygen levels to fall.  According to his doctor, blood tests on Monday detected infection-fighting antibodies, which a Regeneron spokesperson said were probably from the treatment.

He mistakenly said the drug was called Regeneron.  Regeneron\u2019s drug is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies - manufactured copies of antibodies that are one of the main weapons the immune system generates to fight infections.

He was cautious about broader use without more data.  \u201cAll we have seen are very brief press releases ... so there is not much to go on,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe politics of the situation would suggest to me that the story could be Trump gets COVID ... then American technology fostered by the Trump Administration cures COVID,\u201d Sostman added. \u201cI would think there would be pressure on regulators.\u201d  Top U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, speaking on Monday on CNN, said he was \u201cstrongly suspicious\u201d that Regeneron\u2019s drug has contributed to Trump\u2019s progress. \u201cObviously you can\u2019t prove that until you do a number of studies to show that it actually works,\u201d he said.

Regeneron also plans to study REGN-COV2 for preventing the infection in people at high-risk of exposure - such as healthcare workers - and in uninfected people with close exposure to someone who has tested positive for the virus.  Antibodies are proteins made by the body\u2019s immune system that recognize, bind and neutralize an invading virus. Regeneron\u2019s cocktail - which contains an antibody made by the company and a second isolated from humans who recovered from COVID-19 - is designed so that its two antibodies bind to the coronavirus\u2019 spike protein, limiting the ability of viruses to escape.  Trial patients will be given a single intravenous infusion of REGN-COV2. In the prevention segments of the study, participants will be given smaller subcutaneous doses, Yancopoulus said. Investigators will be measuring patients\u2019 viral loads and keeping track of symptoms.  Regeneron said its treatment could be useful even if a COVID-19 vaccine is developed since the elderly and people with compromised immune systems often do not respond well to vaccines.  Yancopoulos said, even though Regeneron does not yet have proof that REGN-COV2 is effective, the company has cleared the way for production of the antibody compound at its New York manufacturing facility.

The drug is part of a class of biotech therapies known as monoclonal antibodies. Several companies are using the technology to manufacture copies of human antibodies to the new coronavirus.  Regeneron believes its dual-antibody formula will limit the ability of the virus to escape detection and attack.  Eli Lilly & Co earlier this month released data showing that one of its monoclonal antibodies lowered patient virus levels and could reduce the need for patients to be hospitalized.  Regeneron tested two different doses of REGN-COV2 in two patient populations: those who had mounted an effective immune response on their own (seropositive), and those whose immune response was not yet adequate (seronegative).  In seronegative patients, the median time to symptom relief was 13 days for the placebo group, 8 days for the high-dose group and 6 days for the low-dose group.  Regeneron said REGN-COV2 rapidly reduced virus levels in seronegative patients. In addition, patients with higher virus levels at the start of the trial had correspondingly greater reductions in viral load with REGN-COV2, which is given by intravenous infusion.  \u201cThe data are favorable for seronegative patients,\u201d Yee said.  The U.S. government in June awarded Regeneron a $450 million supply contract for up to 300,000 doses of the antibody cocktail.  Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG last month agreed to boost overall manufacturing capacity for REGN-COV2 by at least three-and-a-half times. Under the deal, Regeneron would handle U.S. sales of the treatment and Roche would be responsible for the rest of the world.","152":"July 7 (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc said on Tuesday the U.S. government has granted the drugmaker a $450 million contract to make and supply its double antibody cocktail that is being tested against COVID-19.

Regeneron and rival Eli Lilly\u2019s antibody therapies have so far seen lackluster demand as patients need to be isolated for administering the drug through one-time intravenous infusion, which adds to the challenges faced by hospitals that are already teeming with cases of coronavirus infection.  Regeneron\u2019s antibody cocktail garnered $145.5 million in sales for the fourth quarter. While, the consensus Wall Street estimate was $173 million, according to Guggenheim analyst Yatin Suneja.  Last month, the company blamed the underwhelming sales on timing, as it will be delivering additional doses of the therapy to the United States in the first quarter.

Trump touted the Lilly drug, along with the antibody treatment from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O that he received for his COVID-19, as tantamount to a cure in a video he posted last week.  The announcement comes one day after Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N said it was forced to pause a large high-profile trial of its experimental coronavirus vaccine because a volunteer fell ill. J&J said it does not yet know if that person was given the vaccine or a placebo.  AstraZeneca Plc's AZN.L U.S. trial for its experimental COVID-19 vaccine has also been on hold for over a month after a volunteer in its UK study fell ill. Trials of that vaccine resumed in other regions after a brief halt.  Lilly said earlier this month it was applying for emergency use authorization (EUA) for the antibody drug, LY-CoV555, for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 based on data from another clinical trial.  It is not uncommon to pause drug trials to investigate safety concerns, and such actions do not necessarily indicate a serious problem. Because of the urgent need for drugs and vaccines to tackle a pandemic that has claimed over 1 million lives worldwide - and the speed with which they are being developed - these trials have come under intense scrutiny.  \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, the ACTIV-3 independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) has recommended a pause in enrollment,\u201d Lilly spokeswoman Molly McCully said in an emailed statement. \u201cLilly is supportive of the decision by the independent DSMB to cautiously ensure the safety of the patients participating in this study.\u201d  The Indianapolis-based drugmaker did not comment on the implications for the paused trial, called ACTIV-3, which is testing the treatment on COVID-19 patients who require hospitalization, or on its other ongoing trials. It is also testing the drug in nursing homes to see if it can prevent staff and residents from getting infected.  Lilly is conducting the trial in partnership with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a division of National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIAID said it paused the trial at the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration did not immediately reply to requests for comment.  The ACTIV-3 trial began in August and is aiming to recruit 10,000 patients primarily in the United States.  The trial compares patients who receive Lilly's antibody drug plus Gilead Sciences Inc's GILD.O antiviral drug remdesivir with those who receive remdesivir alone.  Lilly sought the EUA from U.S. regulators after publishing data in September showing LY-CoV555 helped cut hospitalization and emergency room visits for COVID-19 patients.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has so far delivered over 250,000 doses of Lilly\u2019s bamlanivimab and Regeneron\u2019s antibody combination of casirivimab and imdevimab to states and territories.  Both treatments have U.S. emergency use authorization for non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients at risk of becoming severely ill due to age or underlying health conditions.  The drugs are monoclonal antibodies, known as MAbs in medical shorthand, manufactured copies of proteins produced by the body to fight coronavirus infection.

That would top 1 million doses by the end of the year, he said.  Trump received Regeneron\u2019s treatment last week. In a radio interview with Rush Limbaugh on Friday, Trump said he is working to get both drugs approved quickly and that he may not have recovered without the treatments he received.  Both companies have said the drugs were shown to work in clinical trials and that they have submitted an emergency use authorization to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The drugs are not identical: Regeneron\u2019s treatment is a cocktail of two antibodies meant to protect against the virus, while Lilly\u2019s is a single antibody. Because they have not been tested against the other, it is difficult to know if one is more effective than the other.  It is unclear how long the FDA process to authorize emergency use of the drugs will take. Unless the companies receive that authorization, doctors cannot administer the drugs to patients outside of clinical trials or without a compassionate use authorization like the one President Trump received.  If the drugs are authorized for use by the FDA, Mango said that the government will allocate the treatments to the states based on need, similar to the mechanism used with Gilead Sciences Inc's GILD.O antiviral drug remdesivir for COVID-19.  Regeneron signed a $450 million deal in July to sell Operation Warp Speed enough doses of its antibody treatment, REGN-COV2, to treat around 300,000 people.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals said on Friday it would stop enrolling patients receiving advanced COVID-19 care in a trial testing its experimental antibody treatment in hospitalized patients, based on the recommendation of an independent safety board.  The recommendation was based on a potential safety signal and an unfavorable risk-benefit profile at this time, the company said. Rival Eli Lilly & Co stopped enrolling such patients based on a similar suggestion earlier this week.  \u201cIt appears a trend is emerging in the class, and it may be that neutralizing antibodies simply do not work and\/or are not safe in this (hospitalized) population,\u201d JP Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov said in a note.  Both treatments belong to a class of drugs known as monoclonal antibodies. Regeneron\u2019s drug, which was administered to U.S. President Donald Trump before he was hospitalized, was credited by him for his recovery from COVID-19.  Regeneron continues to enroll other types of patients for trials and its enrollment in non-hospitalized patients as well as hospitalized patients requiring either no or a low level of oxygen has been backed by the independent data monitoring committee.  The treatment lowers virus loads in some non-hospitalized patients, the drugmaker said on Wednesday. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is evaluating the treatment for a potential emergency use authorization (EUA) in mild-to-moderate patients at high risk for poor outcome.  Regeneron said it will inform the health regulator about the latest move. President Trump had earlier said he would push for an EUA status for it and make it free to Americans. JP Morgan\u2019s Kasimov said he still expects the treatment to get the tag.  The antibody cocktail is being studied in four late-stage clinical studies, including the Recovery trial in the UK.

The drugmaker said it plans to use detailed results from the trial as the basis of regulatory submissions and that it would also conduct a study in children with FOP.  The drug, garetosmab, tested in patients with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), reduces the formation of bone lesions by neutralizing a protein called Activin A.  The protein is critical to heterotopic ossification, a process where the muscles, tendons and ligaments of FOP patients are progressively replaced by bone.  FOP leads to abnormal bone formation resulting in skeletal deformities, progressive loss of mobility and premature death, and has no approved treatments, the drugmaker said.  There are only about 800 patients diagnosed with the disorder worldwide and most of them are wheelchair bound by the age of 30, the company said. FOP patients, on average, live as long as 56 years.","180":"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved Regeneron Pharmaceuticals\u2019 triple antibody cocktail as the first Ebola virus treatment, lending validation to similar drugs being developed for COVID-19.

Shares of the company rose 6.8% to $332, adding over $2 billion to Regeneron\u2019s market value after it said its board had authorized a $1 billion buyback of common stock.  Sales of Eylea, which has brought in over a $1 billion in quarterly revenue for more than two years, surged despite Roche Holding AG ROG.S and Novartis AG's NOVN.S Lucentis, among others, snapping at its heels.  Quarterly sales of Eylea rose 14% to $1.92 billion, ahead of analysts\u2019 estimate of $1.61 billion, according to Refinitiv estimates. The drug treats age-related degeneration in eyes.  The sales were helped by a shortage of rival Roche Holding's ROG.S Avastin, Regeneron commercial head Marion McCourt said on a conference call.  \u201cWe are hearing that patients that started on Eylea because of these shortages do continue on Eylea therapy,\u201d said McCourt.  Analysts, however, fear the recent approval of Novartis\u2019 anti-blindness drug Beovu could eat into sales of Eylea, adding to its troubles as it is expected to lose patents in the next five years.  Regeneron also disclosed in a filing on Tuesday that it had received a civil investigative demand from the U.S. Department of Justice into incentives paid to doctors that could violate certain federal laws.  The request for information relates to several of its drugs including Eylea and Dupixent, Regeneron said, adding that it was cooperating with the investigation.  Meanwhile, Regeneron is expecting Dupixent, developed with Sanofi SASY.PA, to be its next growth driver and has massed up approvals for three major diseases including asthma and nasal polyps, since the drug was approved in 2017.  Dupixent\u2019s quarterly sales more than doubled to $633.1 million, beating expectations of $620.6 million.  Separately, the company also reported interim data from a late-stage trial of its drug Libtayo in lung cancer patients.  Guggenheim analyst Yatin Suneja said the rate of response for Libtayo seen in the trial was broadly in line with Merck & Co's MRK.N Keytruda, which dominates the market for first-line treatment of advanced lung cancer.  The drug could be a potential threat to Keytruda if it continued to display similar responses, Suneja said in a client note.

The company\u2019s shares were up 3% at $668.35 before the bell.  Regeneron is among several drugmakers racing to develop a treatment for the novel coronavirus and earlier this week said its experimental COVID-19 antibody drug combination, REGN-COV2, prevented and treated the disease in rhesus macaques and hamsters.

The average annual compensation for non-executive directors at S&P 500 companies rose 2 percent to $304,856 last year, topping $300,000 for the first time and 43 percent higher than it was 10 years ago, according to a new report released by executive headhunters Spencer Stuart.  But thanks largely to stock grants some earned a lot more than that.  Directors at biotechnology company Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc received, on average, $1.2 million in compensation last year. That figure does not include the more than $6 million received by Regeneron\u2019s independent chairman, company disclosures show.  And the non-executive directors of Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs Group Inc made $599,279 on average in 2018, the highest for any financial company in the S&P. That was, though, down from $604,837 in 2017. The investment bank, which had 13 board meetings last year, declined to comment beyond disclosures in its proxy statement.  S&P 500 boards met, on average, just 7.9 times, in person or via telephone, during 2018. That\u2019s down from 9 a decade ago, according to Spencer Stuart.  The bigger payouts are being made at a sensitive time for Corporate America. A top contender for the Democratic presidential nomination for the 2020 election, Elizabeth Warren, has the boardroom in her sights as she seeks to tackle inequality in American society. As well as proposals such as a wealth tax aimed at billionaires, Warren has proposed that workers at U.S. corporations elect at least 40% of board members.  Warren\u2019s campaign declined to comment.  Investors are also taking an increasingly feisty view of directors\u2019 compensation, which is typically set by the board itself. A growing number of shareholder lawsuits are challenging big-ticket board compensation packages.  As a result, more companies are expected to put these matters to a shareholder vote at company annual meetings, said Paul Hodgson, a compensation expert and senior adviser at ESGuage, a corporate governance data and analysis firm.  \u201cThere\u2019s a certain amount of nervousness within companies about what they\u2019re paying directors,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cMore attention is being paid to outliers than in the past.\u201d  Compensation limits are also becoming more prevalent, with advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis backing demands from some shareholders, according to global risk advisory firm Willis Towers Watson.  A study by the firm found that the number of companies with an annual compensation limit for directors increased to 63% in 2018 from 55% the previous year.  For some, being a director can mean doing as little as attending regularly scheduled meetings.  Board experts say, though, that the job can be a lot more demanding than that. The National Association of Corporate Directors estimates board members commit at least 250 hours a year to their responsibilities.  A director may visit company factories and offices, read and comment on background papers, and is often involved in board committee work. Regeneron director Christine Poon, for example, participated in 21 meetings last year, including 10 as chair of the compensation committee.  Directors at software developer Roper Technologies Inc , who on average received nearly $910,000 in 2018, participate in at least 15 days of board meetings a year, according to the company\u2019s proxy filing. That works out at over $60,000 per day.  Roper says the compensation reflects their contribution to the company\u2019s superior performance - a cumulative return of 1,084% over the past 15 years compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 207%, according to the proxy.  Roper did not return email and calls seeking comment.  Some companies are proud to be miserly. Microsoft Corp founder Bill Gates received just $3,300 last year for his work as a director of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, which is run by fellow billionaire Warren Buffett.  And directors at fashion company Ralph Lauren Corp received nearly all of their pay in cash in 2018, and made a lot less than their peers, pulling down just $107,299, according to Spencer Stuart.  At some companies, there is a delay in directors receiving the full benefit of their service. That is the case at Goldman, whose directors don\u2019t receive shares from their restricted stock grants until they retire.  Smaller, lesser known biopharmaceutical companies can offer the biggest compensation packages.  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc awards a $400,000 restricted stock grant to directors that vests after one year. It\u2019s the key feature in a package that averaged $613,128 per director last year. Vertex did not return messages seeking comment.  Regeneron Chairman Roy Vagelos received $6.35 million in 2018, benefiting from big stock option awards, and that was down from $11.8 million in 2017.  Regeneron, known for drugs that treat eye disease, held six board meetings in 2018. Vagelos, a former CEO of Merck & Co Inc , attended all of those as well as three technology committee meetings.  \u201cThe quality of our board is unparalleled \u2013 over half our directors are members of the National Academy of Sciences and two of our directors are Nobel laureates,\u201d said Regeneron spokeswoman Alexandra Bowie when asked about the compensation  Last year, though, Regeneron did agree to curb its director pay as part of a settlement with investors who sued the company, claiming Vagelos and other directors received excessive compensation.  A new compensation plan in effect this year has resulted in a nearly 50% year-over-year decrease in the reported value of director stock awards on the day they were granted. That will probably start to be reflected in 2019 numbers.  Pharmaceutical company Incyte Corp, whose board members made an average of $493,657 in 2018, also re-evaluated the way it structured directors\u2019 compensation after getting investors\u2019 push back.  Incyte eliminated grants that fixed the number of shares given to directors at the same level each year. When the shares climbed this immediately gave them a year-on-year windfall.  The company now makes annual stock grants based on a target dollar value. Incyte also discontinued an enhanced initial grant of stock for new directors.  \u201cThese changes make our board compensation consistent with other companies,\u201d Incyte spokeswoman Catalina Loveman said.
