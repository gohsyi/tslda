REUTERS\/Mike Blake  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear an appeal filed by a subsidiary of chipmaker Broadcom Inc AVGO.O seeking to put an end to a shareholder lawsuit concerning its 2015 acquisition of Emulex Corp.  The legal question, which could affect other cases, is whether under the Securities and Exchange Act shareholders need to show intent to defraud when suing a company over statements made during the merger and acquisition process.  Avago Technologies Wireless Manufacturing, which later merged with Broadcom, paid almost $610 million to acquire Emulex Corp in 2015. Emulex made equipment for data centers such as chips and routers.  Gary Varjabedian, an Emulex shareholder, filed a securities class action lawsuit in federal court in California around the time of the deal seeking to prevent it. The move failed, but Varjabedian amended his lawsuit to include a claim that Emulex had failed to disclose data about other transactions between semiconductor companies when urging shareholders to accept the offer.  The plaintiffs have said they were misled into accepting a deal that may not have valued Emulex\u2019s shares highly enough.  A district court judge in 2016 dismissed the claim, finding that the plaintiffs had failed to show proof of intent, known in legal parlance as \u201cscienter.\u201d  But in an April 2018 ruling, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived the litigation by ruling that the plaintiffs were not required to show intent. Instead, the court said, only a showing of negligence was required.  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce business group urged the court to take the case, saying that shareholders have no right to make such claims, whether or not there is proof of intent.  A ruling is due by the end of June.","7":"FILE PHOTO: A sign to the campus offices of chip maker Broadcom Ltd is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., November 6, 2017.

Separately, Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O said it discontinued the role of executive chairman and named a new non-executive chairman as it seeks to curry favor with shareholders ahead of a proxy fight with Broadcom now slated for April 5.  Qualcomm also said Tom Horton would continue as its lead director. Horton has been a member of the company's board since December 2008, having previously served as chairman and chief executive officer of American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O.  Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion bid for Qualcomm has warped into a complex fight over regulatory approvals, security nerves about China\u2019s influence on global mobile networks and the best way forward financially for one of the world\u2019s dominant chipmakers.  In an open letter to the U.S. Congress on Friday, Broadcom promised to invest $3 billion in research and engineering and $6 billion in manufacturing in the United States annually. It did not say how those numbers compared with current spending by the two companies.  Broadcom spent about $3.3 billion in 2017 on research and development and $2.7 billion in 2016, while Qualcomm\u2019s R&D investment was significantly higher with about $5.5 billion in 2017 and $5.2 billion in the year before that.  Qualcomm\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, now slated for April 5, was postponed by 30 days after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) this week ordered a national security review of the takeover.

Tom Cotton (R-AR) walks outside the Senate chamber on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S. February 7, 2018.

Saying China and other countries \u201chave been incredibly aggressive and strategic,\u201d Cornyn told reporters outside the Senate that a hostile takeover of the chipmaker by a foreign company would be a cause for concern. Broadcom is based in Singapore.  \u201cI support the idea that the committee on foreign investment takes a close look at that to see that American interests are protected,\u201d he said.  Senator Tom Cotton, a vocal Republican voice on foreign policy, also said he backed further review.  \u201cQualcomm\u2019s work is too important to our national security to let it fall into the hands of a foreign company \u2014 and in a hostile takeover no less,\u201d Cotton said in a statement.  The U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) on Sunday ordered Qualcomm to delay its March 8 shareholder meeting, an unprecedented move that cast new doubt on Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion bid for its U.S. semiconductor peer.  Reuters reported last week that CFIUS had begun looking at Broadcom\u2019s bid amid growing pressure from lawmakers, including President Donald Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans in Congress.","9":"March 5 (Reuters) - A U.S. national security panel\u2019s unusual decision to review Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd\u2019s $117 billion hostile bid for smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm Ltd illustrates an expanding focus on the competitiveness of the U.S. semiconductor industry amid advances by China, regulatory experts said.  The secretive panel, called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), has scuppered several attempts by Chinese technology companies to acquire U.S. chipmakers in the last 12 months over concerns about the transfer of potentially sensitive technology.  Broadcom is not a Chinese company, and has pledged to move its domicile from Singapore to the United States, arguing this will makes its acquisition of Qualcomm not covered by CFIUS. However, many of Qualcomm\u2019s rivals, including Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, are Chinese.  Huawei is forging closer commercial ties with big telecommunication operators across Asia, the Americas and Europe, putting the company in prime position to lead the global race for wireless 5G networks, despite U.S. allegations it poses a security threat.  CFIUS views Qualcomm as a prized U.S. asset in the development of 5G wireless technology, which allows for the transmission of data at very fast speeds. It wants to make sure Qualcomm does not lose its status as a dominant player in wireless chip technology, according to a source familiar with the panel\u2019s thinking.  As a result, Broadcom\u2019s business plan for Qualcomm, including any divestitures it plans in order to appease antitrust regulators, will be scrutinized by CFIUS, lawyers who advised companies on their CFIUS applications said.  \u201cThis shows how indirect exposure to China is a frequent, but under-noticed, source of perceived national security risk,\u201d said Mario Mancuso, a former CFIUS member who is now a partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP.  CFIUS\u2019 stance has toughened as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to pressure China to help tackle North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions and be more accommodative on trade and foreign exchange issues.  Unfilled political vacancies in several government departments and agencies have also made it harder for CFIUS to approve deals.  Canyon Bridge Capital Partners LLC, a U.S.-based private equity firm funded by the Chinese government, saw its $1.3 billion acquisition of U.S. chipmaker Lattice Semiconductor Corp collapse last year after it was blocked by CFIUS, a rejection subsequently upheld by Trump.  Last month, U.S. semiconductor testing company Xcerra Corp said CFIUS had blocked its $580 million sale to a Chinese state-backed semiconductor investment fund.  Reuters reported last week that CFIUS had begun looking at Broadcom\u2019s bid as pressure grew from politicians, including senior Republican U.S. Senator John Cornyn.  \u201cQualcomm is a leader in 5G technology, which is going to be the new standard in the future. And, as we\u2019ve seen, some of our international rivals, like China, have been incredibly aggressive and strategic,\u201d Cornyn said on Monday. He has proposed legislation to tighten CFIUS\u2019 scrutiny of deals.  PROXY CONTEST  CFIUS\u2019 intervention was unusual in that the panel typically reviews signed deals. However, Qualcomm has been resisting Broadcom\u2019s overtures, prompting the latter to nominate six directors to Qualcomm\u2019s 11-member board at its shareholder meeting. CFIUS on Sunday ordered Qualcomm to postpone its shareholder meeting, which was scheduled for Tuesday, for a month.  Qualcomm filed a voluntary request for CFIUS to review Broadcom\u2019s bid on Jan. 29. CFIUS rules allow a company facing an unsolicited takeover bid to request a CFIUS review, so that its board of directors can better assess the regulatory risk of a deal.  \u201cThe rules say that one party alone could approach CFIUS and for a review,\u201d said McDermott Will & Emery LLP regulatory lawyer David Levine.  Such circumstances are few and far between. Miner Rio Tinto Plc asked CFIUS for a review in 2008 after facing a hostile $150 billion bid by BHP Billiton Ltd, according to a source familiar with the matter. CFIUS allowed the bid, but BHP subsequently walked away from the deal in the aftermath of the financial crisis.  Broadcom struggled to win CFIUS approval to buy Brocade Communications Systems late last year. In the end, that approval came just weeks after Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan announced in an Oval Office ceremony with Trump that Broadcom would bring its headquarters to the United States.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed down 0.4%, with Frankfurt\u2019s DAX index, which lists Europe\u2019s largest chipmaker Infineon, falling 0.6%.  Broadcom, one of the biggest U.S. players in the chip sector, blamed the $2 billion hit to its 2019 sales on trade tensions and the ban on doing business with Huawei Technologies.  The warning battered European peers as concerns about a hit to earnings from a prolonged U.S.-China trade war fed into fears of slowing chip demand.  Infineon, AMS and STMicroelectronics, Siltronic, Dialog Semiconductor fell between 2.5% and 5.5% and pulled the technology sector down 1.8%.  \u201cThis is unlikely to be Broadcom specific but a trend to expect in the second half of this year,\u201d said Neil Campling at technology analyst at Mirabaud Securities in London.  \u201cThe outlook of a rebound for the chip sector, which many hope for, is highly unlikely to materialize.\u201d  Earlier, Chinese data showed industrial output growth slowed to a more than 17-year low in May and sent the euro zone bond yields to fresh lows.  However, Friday\u2019s losses were not severe enough to erode the gains built this week on hopes that monetary easing in Europe and the United States would offset the concerns over growth that drove a sell-off in May. The STOXX 600 ended the week up about 0.4%, its second consecutive week of gains.  \u201cThe flight to safety in bonds isn\u2019t all to do with the rate cut expectations. It is about taking the money out and putting it somewhere more defensive. Autos, banks and techs are the lowest so clearly there is a rotational trade,\u201d said Mark Taylor, sales trader at Mirabaud.  Mining and auto stocks which typically fall on trade concerns, fell about 0.9% each.  Utilities, among sectors considered as bond-proxies, rose 0.5%, helped by shares of National Grid, which was upgraded by Bernstein and France\u2019s Rubis.  Brokerage recommendations also drove moves in shares, with Swedish oil firm Lundin Petroleum rising 2.9% after Goldman Sachs upgraded its shares to \u201cbuy\u201d from \u201cneutral\u201d.  DKSH Holdings tumbled 10% after Credit Suisse downgraded shares of the Switzerland-based consultancy to \u201cunderperform\u201d.","11":"(Reuters) - Former Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O Chairman Paul Jacobs has informed its board of directors that he will seek to partner with investment firms to make an offer for the U.S. semiconductor company, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Jacobs' attempt to put together an offer comes just a few days after Qualcomm fended off a $117 billion hostile bid from Singapore-based rival Broadcom Ltd AVGO.O thanks to an order by U.S. President Donald Trump prohibiting the deal due to national security concerns.  Qualcomm does not view Jacobs' attempt to put together a buyout bid as credible, the sources said. Jacobs has held talks with several investment firms, including SoftBank Group Corp's 9984.T Vision Fund, but has so far been unable to secure the necessary financing, the three sources added.  Jacobs is attempting to put together the largest leveraged buyout of all time, three times as large as the $45 billion buyout of Texas power utility Energy Future Holdings, which ended in bankruptcy.  Even if SoftBank, a Japanese telecommunications group with technology investments around the world, wanted to join Jacobs\u2019 bid, it could face conflicts given its ownership of British chip designer ARM Holdings Plc, the sources said. Adding to the potential conflicts, Qualcomm is an investor in the Vision Fund.  SoftBank\u2019s deals are also subject to review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the U.S. national security panel that also objected to Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm.  The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Qualcomm declined to comment, while Jacobs and SoftBank could not be immediately reached for comment. The Financial Times first reported on Jacob\u2019s buyout efforts earlier on Thursday.  Jacobs, who still sits on Qualcomm\u2019s board, was stripped of his title of executive chairman earlier this month when Jeffrey Henderson, another Qualcomm director, was named non-executive chairman.  While Jacobs shared the view of Qualcomm\u2019s board that Broadcom\u2019s bid undervalued the company and was fraught with regulatory risks, many on Qualcomm\u2019s board blamed him for the dissatisfaction of some Qualcomm\u2019s shareholders with the company\u2019s handling of Broadcom\u2019s bid, according to the sources.  Jacobs, whose father Irwin co-founded Qualcomm, is up for re-election as board director, alongside other Qualcomm nominees, at the company\u2019s shareholder meeting on March 23. Proxy advisory firm ISS on Wednesday recommended to Qualcomm shareholders that they vote for Broadcom\u2019s four nominees on Qualcomm\u2019s 11-person board, even though their nominations have been withdrawn, as a form of protest.  Given that Qualcomm\u2019s board director slate faces no competition, the re-election of Qualcomm\u2019s board directors is assured. However, limited support for Qualcomm\u2019s nominees could put pressure on Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf, who was criticized by some investors for inviting CFIUS to review Broadcom\u2019s bid, to make changes to the company\u2019s strategy.","12":"June 4 (Reuters) - Broadcom Inc on Thursday forecast current-quarter revenue, the mid-point of which was slightly below Wall Street estimates as its chip business was weighed down by the impact of the coronavirus crisis on global supply chains.

A sign to the campus offices of chip maker Broadcom Ltd is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., November 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Broadcom in February detailed the jumbo loan, the biggest committed credit package since global brewer AB InBev\u2019s US$75bn loan in 2015 that backed its purchase of rival SABMiller, for what would be the technology sector\u2019s largest deal ever. The loans represented a huge windfall for bankers eager to put money to work and rake in related fees.  \u201cBroadcom\u2019s 12 bridge lenders now stand to split a total pool of just US$20m to US$40m in fees,\u201d said Jeff Nassof, a director at Freeman Consulting Services. \u201cHad the transaction closed, fees for the proposed long-term debt financing package could have reached 10 times this amount.\u201d  The whittled down fees that will be earned include money paid upfront and ticking fees accrued from the time the loan opened, he said. The lost fees include those that would have been taken in by underwriting roughly US$31bn in permanent bond financing that the company said it would issue to reduce the bridge.  The original 12 banks were in the process of downsizing their risk by expanding the bank group when the White House announced it was blocking the bid.  RECORD LOAN THAT WASN\u2019T  The bank financing package included a US$20bn, one-year cash flow bridge facility; a US$4.477bn, two-year term loan; a US$19.679bn, three-year term loan; a US$19.679bn, five-year term loan; and a US$5bn, five-year revolving credit facility, LPC previously reported.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Mizuho, SMBC, MUFG, Wells Fargo, Scotiabank, BMO Capital Markets, Royal Bank of Canada and Morgan Stanley were lead arrangers and joint bookrunners on the syndicated loan.  The banks were either unavailable to immediately comment, or declined to comment.  Silver Lake, KKR and CVC had also agreed to provide US$6bn of convertible bond financing to Broadcom.  With this milestone loan going away, based on administration worries that the merger would give China an upper hand in mobile communications, bankers will have plenty of lending capacity to apply to other situations. The decision to scuttle the deal was based on concerns that the US advantage would be lost to China if Singapore-based Broadcom took over San Diego-based Qualcomm, according to a White House official.  \u201cThere is no issue with capacity in the market, full stop,\u201d said a banker not involved in the deal. \u201cBanks are looking to do business.

The revolver pays an initial commitment fee of 12.5bp.  In syndicated loans for investment grade credits, a portion of the bridge fees is usually paid at the announcement of the deal. The other portion is paid at 90 days.  The first dozen banks only got to cash in on the first part.  \u201cIf you get an executive order that the deal is not going to happen the [loan] deal goes away,\u201d the banker said.

Shares of Broadcom Inc plunged 6.83% after it cut its full-year revenue forecast by $2 billion, blaming the U.S.-China trade conflict and export curbs on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.  Shares of Apple Inc also slipped 1.66% and weighed the most on the three main indexes.

The presidential order reflected a calculation that the United States\u2019 lead in creating technology and setting standards for the next generation of mobile cell phone communications would be lost to China if Singapore-based Broadcom took over San Diego-based Qualcomm, according to a White House official.  Qualcomm has emerged as one of the biggest competitors to China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL] in the sector, making Qualcomm a prized asset.  Qualcomm had earlier rebuffed Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion bid, which was under investigation by the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a multi-agency panel led by the Treasury Department that reviews the national security implications of acquisitions of U.S. corporations by foreign companies.  In a letter on March 5, CFIUS said it was investigating whether Broadcom would starve Qualcomm of research dollars that would allow it to compete and also cited the risk of Broadcom\u2019s relationship with \u201cthird party foreign entities.\u201d  While it did not identify those entities, the letter repeatedly described Qualcomm as the leading company in so-called 5G technology development and standard setting.  \u201cA shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States,\u201d CFIUS said. \u201cWhile the United States remains dominant in the standards-setting space currently, China would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover.\u201d  NATIONAL SECURITY AND HUAWEI  A White House official on Monday confirmed that the national security concerns related to the risks of Broadcom\u2019s relationship with third party foreign entities.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  A source familiar with CFIUS\u2019 thinking had said that, if the deal was completed, the U.S. military was concerned that within 10 years, \u201cthere would essentially be a dominant player in all of these technologies and that\u2019s essentially Huawei, and then the American carriers would have no choice. They would just have to buy Huawei (equipment).\u201d  Huawei has been forging closer commercial ties with big telecom operators across Europe and Asia, putting it in prime position to lead the global race for 5G networks despite U.S. concerns.  Huawei has a dominant position in China, which is set to become the world\u2019s biggest 5G market by far, and has also made inroads in the rest of world to compete with rivals such as Ericsson ERICb.ST and Nokia NOKIA.HE in several lucrative markets, including countries that are longstanding U.S. allies.  Qualcomm is also a major player in 5G, estimated to have 15 percent of 5G-essential patents in the world, compared with 11 percent for Nokia and 10 percent for all of China, according to a Jefferies report citing LexInnova research. Many smartphone makers are counting on Qualcomm to deliver its 5G chipset on time in late 2018 to roll out their 5G phones in 2019.  Shares of Broadcom rose less than 1.0 percent to $264.10 in after-hours trade while Qualcomm fell 4.3 percent to $60.14.  Broadcom said it was reviewing the presidential order. \u201cBroadcom strongly disagrees that its proposed acquisition of Qualcomm raises any national security concerns,\u201d it said in a statement in response to the decision.  Qualcomm, which had delayed its annual shareholder meeting during the CFIUS review, set the new date for March 23.  The move by Trump to kill the deal comes only months after the U.S. president himself stood next to Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan at the White House, announcing the company\u2019s decision to move its headquarters to the United States and calling it \u201cone of the really great, great companies.\u201d  Slideshow ( 4 images )  This is the fifth time a U.S. president has blocked a deal based on CFIUS objections and the second deal Trump has stopped since assuming office slightly over a year ago.  \u201cThe proposed takeover of Qualcomm by the Purchaser (Broadcom) is prohibited, and any substantially equivalent merger, acquisition, or takeover, whether effected directly or indirectly, is also prohibited,\u201d the presidential order released on Monday said.  The order cited \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that led Trump to believe that Broadcom\u2019s taking control of Qualcomm \u201cmight take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.\u201d  BROADCOM\u2019S NEXT MOVE  Broadcom had struggled to complete its proposed deal to buy Qualcomm, which had cited several concerns including the price offered and potential antitrust hurdles.  The presidential decision to block the deal cannot be appealed. However, it is not clear what rules Broadcom would have to follow if it goes ahead with announced plans to move its headquarters to the United States.  Companies may challenge CFIUS\u2019s jurisdiction in court but may not challenge the inter-agency panel\u2019s national security findings, a CFIUS expert said.  If Broadcom decides to press on with its effort to buy Qualcomm, it would be wise to drop the matter for now while the company quietly wraps up its move to the United States, a second CFIUS expert said. Once the move is done, Broadcom could argue that CFIUS does not have jurisdiction, the second expert said.  Both spoke privately to protect business relationships.","28":"Feb 20 (Reuters) - Broadcom Ltd:  * LEADING INDEPENDENT PROXY ADVISORY FIRM ISS RECOMMENDS QUALCOMM STOCKHOLDERS VOTE ON THE BLUE PROXY CARD FOR FOUR OF BROADCOM\u2019S NOMINEES  * BROADCOM - ANNOUNCED INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER SERVICES RECOMMENDED QUALCOMM STOCKHOLDERS VOTE \u201cFOR\u201d 4 OF BROADCOM\u2019S INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR NOMINEES Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Bangalore.newsroom@thomsonreuters.com)","29":"* Qualcomm proposes further price talks with Broadcom  * Focus on Fed chief\u2019s testimony, inflation data this week  * Futures up: Dow 143 pts, S&P 10 pts, Nasdaq 27 pts (Adds comment, details, updates prices)  Feb 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures pointed to a strong start for Wall Street on Monday, with investors hoping that new Fed chair Jerome Powell will keep the U.S. central bank on a steady course of monetary tightening.

FILE PHOTO: Broadcom Limited company logo is pictured on an office building in Rancho Bernardo, California May 12, 2016. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The previously undisclosed requirement shows that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies for potential national security risks, is aware that its jurisdiction could be contested if Broadcom redomiciles to the United States.  The panel on Sunday ordered San Diego-based Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O to postpone its shareholder meeting by 30 days so it could investigate Broadcom's $117 billion hostile bid for Qualcomm.  Lawyers that specialize in advising companies on CFIUS matters have been debating this week whether Broadcom\u2019s bid would be subject to a CFIUS review once it redomiciles.  \u201cIt is not entirely clear how establishing a U.S. domicile would affect CFIUS\u2019 view of its jurisdiction over the proposed transaction,\u201d Kirkland & Ellis LLP, a U.S. law firm not involved in the matter, wrote in a note to clients on Friday.  \u201cCFIUS\u2019 determination as to whether an entity is considered \u2018foreign\u2019 is nuanced and not prescriptive, and encompasses considerations that include a facts and circumstances assessment of ownership and formal and informal mechanisms of control,\u201d the Kirkland lawyers wrote.  Broadcom said on Friday it expected to complete its move to the United States by May 6. It disclosed it had petitioned a Singapore court on March 9 to order the convening of a special shareholder meeting to approve the redomiciliation. This meeting will be held on March 23, the company said. The Singapore Court will then have to greenlight the redomiciliation.  \u201cWe are aware of the terms in the (CFIUS) order and are in full compliance,\u201d a Broadcom spokeswoman said by email when asked whether the company had given CFIUS the required five-day notice on action to redomicile.  CFIUS\u2019 instructions to Broadcom were disclosed by Qualcomm in a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that contained CFIUS\u2019 interim order to both companies. Qualcomm and a spokesman for the U.S. Treasury, which chairs CFIUS, declined to comment.  CFIUS in its order on Sunday also instructed Qualcomm not to take any action that could lead to a deal with Broadcom during the panel\u2019s review, Qualcomm\u2019s regulatory filing showed. Broadcom has nominated six directors for election to Qualcomm\u2019s 11-member board as a way to force negotiations between the two companies.  CFIUS, an inter-agency panel led by the U.S. Treasury, rarely reviews mergers before a deal has been clinched. The review of Broadcom\u2019s bid illustrates the U.S. government\u2019s expanding focus on the competitiveness of the national semiconductor industry as China advances.  The U.S. government is concerned that Chinese companies, including the big network equipment and mobile phone maker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], would take advantage of any openings to take the lead in the next generation mobile phone networks known as 5G.  \u201cAs a U.S. corporation, our future acquisitions in the United States would not be subject to certain regulatory processes required for acquisitions by foreign corporations,\u201d Broadcom said in a regulatory filing on Friday.","36":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window.)  * Broadcom slides after warning of chip demand slowdown  * Tech down most among 11 major S&P sectors; Chips tumble  * China\u2019s May industrial output growth cools to 17-yr low  * Data shows U.S. retail sales rise in May  * Indexes down: Dow 0.16%, S&P 0.24%, Nasdaq 0.53% (Updates prices, comments)  By Shreyashi Sanyal  June 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dropped on Friday, as shares of chipmakers sank on a warning from sector major Broadcom of a broad weakening in global demand and Chinese data pointed to the worst slowdown in industrial growth in 17 years.  Shares of Broadcom Inc fell 6.53% after it cut its full-year revenue forecast by $2 billion, blaming the U.S.-China trade conflict and export curbs on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd .  Shares of Apple Inc also slipped 1% and weighed the most on the three main indexes. Broadcom is a major supplier to the iPhone maker.  \u201cUntil there\u2019s a resolution or some type of clarity on the trade deal with China, you\u2019re going to see the chipmakers show weakness,\u201d said Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Informa Financial Intelligence in Zephyr Cove, Nevada.  Losses in chip companies, who both source product and sell heavily in China, dragged the benchmark S&P 500 index lower, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index tumbling 2.67%.  \u201cPeople are backing off of optimism that a trade deal will get done and it\u2019ll probably drag out longer into the year,\u201d Nauman said.  China\u2019s industrial output growth in May slowed below expectations and showed signs of weakening demand, sending a chill through stock market investors globally.  Technology stocks fell 0.8%, the most among the 11 major S&P sectors. The trade-sensitive industrials slipped 0.61%.  At 11:27 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 41.61 points, or 0.16%, at 26,065.16, the S&P 500 was down 7.07 points, or 0.24%, at 2,884.57 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 41.69 points, or 0.53%, at 7,795.44.  The S&P 500 index has gained 4.8% in June so far and was on track to end the week slightly higher, on hopes the Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates.  A Fed meeting next week may provide the acid test of market expectations that the U.S. central bank could cut rates as much as three times this year, while a G20 summit at the end of the month may yet yield more progress on a trade deal.  In a bright spot, data showed U.S. retail sales increased in May and sales for the prior month were revised higher, suggesting a pick-up in consumer spending that could ease fears the economy was slowing down sharply in the second quarter.  Online pet products retailer Chewy Inc rose 63% in its market debut on Monday, at a valuation of over $14 billion and joined a host of high-profile companies, such as Lyft Inc and Uber Technologies Inc that listed on U.S. stock exchanges this year.

The government action on Sunday highlighted growing U.S. concerns about safeguarding semiconductor technology and cast a doubt on the deal\u2019s success. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews deals for potential national security concerns, rarely reviews mergers before companies have clinched an agreement.  CFIUS asked Qualcomm to postpone its shareholder meeting, scheduled for Tuesday, by 30 days. Reuters reported last week that CFIUS had begun looking at Broadcom\u2019s bid as pressure grew from politicians, including senior Republican Senator John Cornyn.  \u201cThis measure will afford CFIUS the ability to investigate fully Broadcom\u2019s proposed acquisition of Qualcomm,\u201d the U.S. Treasury Department, which oversees CFIUS, said in a statement.  Qualcomm said in a statement late on Monday that it was delaying its 2018 annual meeting to April 5 as a result of the CFIUS order.  Stockholders who have already voted would be able to change their votes at the meeting, it said.  The semiconductor industry is locked in a race to develop chips that power so-called 5G wireless technology, allowing the transmission of data at faster speeds. San Diego-based Qualcomm has emerged as one of the biggest competitors to Chinese companies vying for market share in the sector, such as Huawei Technologies Co, making it a prized asset.  A source familiar with CFIUS\u2019 thinking said that if the deal was completed, the U.S. military was concerned that within 10 years, \u201cthere would essentially be a dominant player in all of these technologies and that\u2019s essentially Huawei, and then the American carriers would have no choice. They would just have to buy Huawei (equipment).\u201d  Additionally, U.S. officials speaking on condition of anonymity said members of Congress and Federal Communications Commission officials were concerned that Broadcom could sell part of Qualcomm to a Chinese firm. Such a move could hurt the U.S. effort to develop 5G wireless technology because of the small existing number of suppliers that build the hardware.  A CFIUS review in itself does not mean a deal will be halted. CFIUS, under former President Barack Obama and current President Donald Trump, has soured on high-tech deals, particularly involving semiconductors, or involving sensitive information about American citizens.  Part of CFIUS\u2019 current concern, which is echoed in a letter Cornyn sent to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin last week, could lie in the fact that Broadcom has failed to strike a deal with Qualcomm. Instead, Broadcom has resorted to what is essentially a hostile takeover by putting forward a slate of six Broadcom nominees for Qualcomm\u2019s 11-member board.  Broadcom shares closed down 1.6 percent, while Qualcomm fell 1.3 percent.  Cornyn said on Monday he was glad CFIUS had decided to review the deal, noting aggression by \u201cinternational rivals, like China.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: A Qualcomm sign is pictured in front of one of its many buildings in San Diego, California November 5, 2014. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  \u201cI support the idea that the committee on foreign investment takes a close look at that to see that American interests are protected,\u201d he added.  Broadcom has struggled to complete its proposed deal to buy Qualcomm as the latter has resisted, citing several concerns including the price offered and potential antitrust hurdles.  Broadcom said on Monday that CFIUS\u2019 intervention was the result of secret moves made by Qualcomm on Jan. 29 to seek an investigation into the offer, which Qualcomm\u2019s board has said significantly undervalues the company.  But Qualcomm, in a press statement, said \u201cBroadcom\u2019s claims that the CFIUS inquiry was a surprise to them has no basis in fact\u201d and that Broadcom had been interacting with CFIUS \u201cfor weeks.\u201d  Before Broadcom disclosed its buyout offer for Qualcomm in November, Trump himself announced Broadcom\u2019s plan to shift its headquarters back to the United States after a White House meeting with Chief Executive Hock Tan.  Trump praised the move at the time, calling Broadcom \u201cone of the really great, great companies.\u201d  Republican U.S. Senator Tom Cotton said on Monday he backed the panel\u2019s decision to delay a Qualcomm shareholder meeting, saying: \u201cQualcomm\u2019s work is too important to our national security to let it fall into the hands of a foreign company.\u201d  MOVING BACK TO THE U.S.  Broadcom said on Monday it is run by a board and senior management team consisting almost entirely of Americans and is largely owned by the same U.S. institutional investors that own Qualcomm.  \u201cBroadcom continues to pursue the redomiciliation process as expeditiously as possible,\u201d Broadcom said. \u201cUpon completion of the redomiciliation, Broadcom\u2019s proposed acquisition of Qualcomm will not be a CFIUS covered transaction.\u201d  Qualcomm, which has told shareholders it is open to the merger at the right price and terms, said last week it had no intention of delaying the annual shareholder meeting.  \"Qualcomm now has their excuse to postpone their critical vote, giving them some breathing room to work on its acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI.O, attempt to make progress on their Apple Inc AAPL.O licensing issues, and attempt to build a stronger case for shareholders,\" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.  Qualcomm on Monday extended its $44 billion tender offer for NXP to March 9, as it awaits clearance from China\u2019s MOFCOM, the only regulator globally required to approve the deal that has yet to do so.  Qualcomm is also in a legal battle with Apple over licensing and allegations that it has not delivered on promised rebates - seen by analysts as an effort by Apple to undermine Qualcomm\u2019s strong position in mobile chips.","52":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window.)  * Broadcom slides after warning of chip demand slowdown  * Tech down most among 11 major S&P sectors; Chips tumble  * China\u2019s May industrial output growth slows to 17-yr low  * Data shows U.S. retail sales rise in May  * Indexes down: Dow 0.14%, S&P 0.25%, Nasdaq 0.54% (Updates to early afternoon)  By Shreyashi Sanyal  June 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dropped on Friday, as shares of chipmakers sank on a warning from sector major Broadcom of a broad weakening in global demand and Chinese data pointed to the worst slowdown in industrial growth in 17 years.

At 13:08 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 37.50 points, or 0.14%, at 26,069.27, the S&P 500 was down 7.34 points, or 0.25%, at 2,884.30 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 42.55 points, or 0.54%, at 7,794.58.  The S&P 500 index has so far gained 4.8% in June and was on track to record a second straight week of gains on hopes the Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates.  A Fed meeting next week may provide the acid test of market expectations that the U.S. central bank could cut rates as much as three times this year, while a G20 summit at the end of the month may yet yield more progress on a trade deal.  In a bright spot, data showed U.S. retail sales increased in May and sales for the prior month were revised higher, suggesting a pick-up in consumer spending that could ease fears the economy was slowing down sharply in the second quarter.  Online pet products retailer Chewy Inc rose 63% in its market debut on Monday, at a valuation of over $14 billion and joined a host of high-profile companies, such as Lyft Inc and Uber Technologies Inc that listed on U.S. stock exchanges this year.  Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.70-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.94-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.  The S&P index recorded 27 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 37 new highs and 64 new lows.

Net income attributable to ordinary shares rose to $6.23 billion, or $14.62 per share, in the first quarter ended Feb. 4, from $239 million, or 57 cents per share, a year earlier.  The company, which announced a quarterly interim dividend, said it recorded a gain of $5.8 billion due to the recently enacted U.S. tax law.  Net revenue rose to $5.33 billion from $4.14 billion.  Broadcom on Wednesday withdrew its $117 billion hostile bid for fellow chipmaker Qualcomm Inc after the deal was blocked by U.S. President Donald Trump over national security concerns. (Reporting by Sonam Rai in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)","54":"(Reuters) - U.S. semiconductor company Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O on Tuesday unveiled a sweetened $44 billion agreement to acquire NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI.O, its most defiant move in its defense against a hostile $121 billion bid from Broadcom Ltd AVGO.O.  FILE PHOTO: A sign on the Qualcomm campus is seen in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The new deal puts pressure on Broadcom to decide if it will stick with a stipulation in its bid that Qualcomm does not raise its offer for NXP. It could strengthen Qualcomm\u2019s defenses because it allows its shareholders to better assess the standalone value of Qualcomm as an alternative to a deal with Broadcom.  Qualcomm shares fell 1.3 percent to $63.99, significantly below Broadcom\u2019s latest $82 per share cash-and-stock offer unveiled on Feb. 5, as investors saw the new NXP deal as increasing the chances of Qualcomm repelling Broadcom.  Broadcom said on Tuesday it was evaluating its options in response to Qualcomm\u2019s move and noted that the revised price for NXP was well beyond what Qualcomm has repeatedly characterized as \u201cfull and fair.\u201d It called the new deal a transfer of value from Qualcomm shareholders to NXP shareholders.  In an interview with Reuters, Qualcomm\u2019s presiding board director Tom Horton argued that the revised deal with NXP represented value for Qualcomm shareholders irrespective of the outcome of the takeover battle with Broadcom.  \u201cIt makes Qualcomm stronger and more profitable and diversified if there is no deal with Broadcom, and if we do decide to pursue a sale the same is true, more value would accrue to the Qualcomm shareholders,\u201d Horton said.  Qualcomm raised its offer for NXP from $110 to $127.50 per share in cash. In exchange, it received binding agreements from nine NXP stockholders that collectively own more than 28 percent of NXP\u2019s outstanding shares to support the deal. These include hedge funds Elliott Advisors (UK) Ltd and Soroban Capital Partners LP, which had spearheaded opposition to the NXP deal.  NXP\u2019s shares rose 6 percent to $125.56. The stock had traded above the original offer price for nearly seven months, reflecting expectations among investors that Qualcomm\u2019s offer would be raised.  NXP shareholders have to tender their shares in an offer that is currently set to expire on March 5, though Qualcomm has repeatedly pushed back this deadline as it awaits clearance from China\u2019s MOFCOM, the only regulator globally needed to approved the deal that has yet to do so. The Chinese New Year holiday this month has delayed this review.  Under the new terms agreed with NXP\u2019s board, the deal with Qualcomm is contingent on 70 percent of NXP\u2019s shares being tendered, instead of the 80 percent threshold required in the earlier agreement signed in October 2016. Once this threshold is reached, Qualcomm can take over the entire company through a \u201csecond-step\u201d transaction mechanism.  The new NXP deal came less than a week after Broadcom and Qualcomm executives met face-to-face for the first time to discuss the differences between the two sides. Qualcomm called the meeting constructive but reiterated it had several concerns over price and regulatory risk.  BOARD CHALLENGE  The acquisition of NXP will help Qualcomm to expand in the fast-growing market for chips used in automobiles and reduce its dependence on the competitive smartphone market.  The takeover battle between Qualcomm and Broadcom is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc AAPL.O and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS use their market dominance to negotiate lower chip prices.  Singapore-based Broadcom is mainly a manufacturer whose connectivity chips are used in products ranging from mobile phones to servers. San Diego-based Qualcomm primarily outsources the manufacturing of its chips which are used for the delivery of broadband and data, a business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology.  To put pressure on Qualcomm, Broadcom has put forward six nominees up for election at Qualcomm\u2019s March 6 shareholder meeting to replace the majority of the company\u2019s eleven-member board of directors.  Proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis on Tuesday recommended Qualcomm shareholders vote for all six director nominees Broadcom has put forward.  Last week, Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) had recommended for the election of four Broadcom nominees. While this recommendation would fall short of Broadcom\u2019s nominees winning a majority on Qualcomm\u2019s board, ISS said such a vote by Qualcomm shareholders would offer a reasonable path to a negotiated deal that would deliver value.  \u201cISS and Glass Lewis only influence a minority of our shareholders. They belie the fact that the Qualcomm board is doing everything it can in the furtherance of the interests of its shareholders. The ISS and Glass Lewis reports are also dated because they came out before certainty was secured on the NXP deal,\u201d Horton said.","55":"Feb 12 (Reuters) - Broadcom Ltd:  * BROADCOM AND FINANCING SOURCES SIGN BINDING FINANCING COMMITMENTS TO FUND CASH COMPONENT OF QUALCOMM ACQUISITION  * BROADCOM LTD - SILVER LAKE JOINED BY KKR AND CVC IN $6 BILLION CONVERTIBLE NOTES FINANCING TO FUND QUALCOMM TRANSACTION  * BROADCOM LTD - SIGNED COMMITTED FINANCING AGREEMENTS TO FUND ITS PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF QUALCOMM INC  * BROADCOM LTD - A GROUP OF 12 FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE AGREED TO PROVIDE UP TO $100 BILLION OF COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES  * BROADCOM LTD - THE $100 BILLION COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES INCLUDE A $5 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND BRIDGE FINANCING  * BROADCOM -AS RESULT FINANCING,HAS SUFFICIENT COMMITTED FINANCING TO FUND $60\/SHARE CASH COMPONENT OF $82\/SHARE OFFER TO ACQUIRE ALL SHARES OF QUALCOMM  * BROADCOM- INVESTMENT FUNDS AFFILIATED WITH SILVER LAKE, KKR, CVC TO GIVE $6 BILLION CONVERTIBLE NOTE FINANCING TO FUND DEAL, POST-CLOSING WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","56":"(Adds Broadcom CEO comment and details including breakup fee and ticking fee from Broadcom letter)  Feb 8 (Reuters) - U.S. semiconductor company Qualcomm Inc on Thursday rejected Broadcom Ltd\u2019s revised $121 billion buyout offer, but proposed meeting its peer to see whether they can address what it called the bid\u2019s \u201cserious deficiencies in value and certainty.\u201d  Qualcomm\u2019s response attempts to strike a balance between continued resistance of Broadcom\u2019s takeover attempt and heeding the calls of some Qualcomm shareholders, who urged the company in recent days to engage with its rival in case it can clinch an attractive deal.  Broadcom said it proposed to meet by this weekend, but Qualcomm was not willing to meet until Tuesday, after the two companies\u2019 respective meetings with proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS.  \u201cWe hope that your willingness to meet with us reflects Qualcomm\u2019s genuine intent to reach an agreement with respect to our February 5 proposal,\u201d Broadcom CEO Hock Tan told Qualcomm Executive Chairman Paul Jacobs in a letter published by Broadcom.  Broadcom said its latest offer was \u201cbest and final\u201d and that it had strong Qualcomm stockholder support.  Qualcomm had rejected Broadcom\u2019s first unsolicited $103 billion acquisition offer in November, without engaging further. In response, Broadcom nominated a slate of directors to replace Qualcomm\u2019s board.  Qualcomm shareholders are scheduled to vote on these nominations at a March 6 meeting.  Qualcomm said Broadcom\u2019s latest $82 per share offer, comprising $60 per share in cash and $22 per share in stock, \u201cmaterially undervalues\u201d Qualcomm and falls short of the firm regulatory commitment it would demand given the significant antitrust risks involved.  Qualcomm shares were up 1.1 percent at $63.12 in after-hours trading on Thursday. Broadcom shares were up 1 percent at $232.00.  Broadcom has promised to pay a breakup fee of $8 billion in the event regulators thwart the deal, as well as a \u201cticking\u201d fee of 6 percent per year on the cash portion of the consideration if the deal takes more than 12 months to close.  Qualcomm argued on Thursday this would not compensate Qualcomm if several large customers were to walk away or infringe their licensing agreements.  It believes Broadcom needs to offer a \u201chell-or-high-water\u201d legal commitment to complete the deal irrespective of divestitures that antitrust watchdogs around the world may require.  \u201cIf you are not willing to agree to do whatever is necessary to ensure a transaction closes, we will need you to be extremely clear and specific about exactly what actions you would refuse to take, so that we can properly evaluate the risk to Qualcomm\u2019s shareholders,\u201d Qualcomm\u2019s Jacobs wrote to Broadcom\u2019s Tan in a letter published by Qualcomm.  Qualcomm also said in its statement that Broadcom\u2019s plan to address antitrust concerns by selling two Qualcomm businesses, its Wi-Fi networking processors and RF Front End chips for mobile phones, was inadequate to allay concerns that the deal would not win regulatory approval.  Qualcomm added that the regulatory approval process could take longer than 18 months and disrupt Qualcomm during a period of explosive innovation in the industry that includes the development of 5G mobile phones, autonomous driving and the expanding use of computerized gadgets from refrigerators to thermostats.  NXP DEAL  The takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd use their market dominance to negotiate down chip prices.  Singapore-based Broadcom is mainly a manufacturer whose connectivity chips are used in products ranging from mobile phones to servers. Qualcomm primarily licenses its technology for the delivery of broadband and data, a business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology.  Broadcom said on Monday its improved offer was premised on either Qualcomm acquiring NXP Semiconductors NV at the current disclosed terms of $110 per share in cash, or the $38 billion transaction being terminated.  NXP shareholders, led by activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, are resisting the deal, pushing for Qualcomm to raise its offer. NXP shares closed at $115.94 on Thursday, indicating investors were expecting a sweeter deal.  Qualcomm\u2019s proposed acquisition of NXP was approved by European Union antitrust regulators last month. Qualcomm expects China\u2019s blessing as early as this month, at which point it has to decide whether it would raise its offer.

Shares of Qualcomm slid 3 percent on growing investor concern that such government scrutiny, unusual for a deal that has not yet been agreed, would scupper any takeover by Broadcom.  Some of the U.S. government\u2019s concerns relate to risks associated with Broadcom\u2019s relationships with foreign entities, Aimen Mir, the Treasury\u2019s deputy assistant secretary for investment security, said in the letter, without identifying who those parties might be.  The letter, dated March 5, was made public by Qualcomm on Tuesday. (bit.ly\/2FtCesY)  The U.S. government\u2019s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ordered a national security review of Broadcom\u2019s proposed deal on Sunday in an unusual move that prompted Qualcomm to delay a March 6 shareholder meeting.  The letter said that, as with every investigation, the review will consider the potential risk of an unnamed \u201cactor\u201d working through Broadcom to hurt U.S. national security, adding that the bulk of CFIUS\u2019 concerns were classified.  CFIUS, made up of representatives from the Departments of Defense, State, Justice, Treasury, Commerce, Energy and Homeland Security, assesses proposed foreign deals to purchase U.S. assets to ensure they do not harm national security.  The inter-agency body, led by the Treasury, rarely looks at mergers before companies have clinched an agreement, highlighting the urgency of U.S. concerns about safeguarding semiconductor technology.  The review of the Broadcom deal illustrates the U.S. government\u2019s expanding focus on the competitiveness of the national semiconductor industry as China advances, regulatory experts said.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The U.S. government is concerned that Chinese companies, including the big network equipment and mobile phone maker Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], will take advantage of any openings to take the lead in the next generation mobile phone networks known as 5G.  \u201cA shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative security consequences for the United States,\u201d Mir\u2019s letter said.

A source familiar with CFIUS\u2019 thinking told Reuters on Monday that if Broadcom acquired Qualcomm, the U.S. military had concerns that within 10 years \u201cthere would essentially be a dominant player in all of these technologies and that\u2019s essentially Huawei.\u201d  Huawei has been forging closer commercial ties with big telecom operators across Europe and Asia, putting the company in prime position to lead the global race for 5G networks despite U.S. concerns.  Its has a dominant position in China, which is set to become the world\u2019s biggest 5G market by far, but has also made inroads in the rest of world to compete with rivals such as Ericsson and Nokia in several lucrative markets, including countries that are longstanding U.S. allies.","63":"(Reuters) -Broadcom Inc on Thursday appointed its principal accounting officer, Kirsten Spears, as chief financial officer and forecast first-quarter revenue above estimates as key client Apple Inc doubles down on 5G devices, driving demand for its chips.

Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, urged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday to have the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, officially review the proposed transaction before a key shareholder vote expected on March 6, according to a letter seen by Reuters.  The pre-deal discussions by CFIUS -- which are extremely rare -- suggest Broadcom\u2019s plans to move its headquarters to the United States before it completes its proposed purchase of Qualcomm may not be enough to sidestep a national security review that could threaten the deal.  Part of CFIUS\u2019 current concern, which is echoed in Cornyn\u2019s letter, could lie in the fact that Broadcom has failed to strike a deal with Qualcomm and has resorted to what is essentially a hostile takeover by putting forward a slate of six Broadcom nominees for Qualcomm\u2019s 11-member board.  If the six are elected on March 6, the vote would give control of Qualcomm to Broadcom\u2019s nominees. That would happen before a CFIUS review or antitrust review is complete.  \u201cI urge CFIUS to promptly review Broadcom\u2019s proposed acquisition of control of Qualcomm\u2019s board, and to act prior to the March 6 Qualcomm meeting to address any national security concerns that may be identified,\u201d Cornyn wrote to Secretary Mnuchin, according to the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.  A spokesman for CFIUS declined to comment. Representatives for Cornyn did not respond to requests for comment.  Broadcom said in a statement Tuesday that it plans to move from Singapore to the United States, following receipt of approvals expected by May 6, and once again be a U.S. corporation.  \u201cWe remain confident in our ability to complete a transaction with Qualcomm within approximately 12 months following the signing of a definitive agreement,\u201d Broadcom said.  A CFIUS review in itself does not mean a deal will be halted. CFIUS, under former President Barack Obama and current President Donald Trump, has soured on high tech deals, particularly involving semiconductors, or involving sensitive information about American citizens.  Microprocessor expert Linley Gwennap, of the Linley Group, said that Qualcomm had world-leading chips in several areas.  \u201cQualcomm is a crown jewel of the American semiconductor industry,\u201d he said. \u201cI would think that CFIUS would be very protective of that. ... Singapore is nominally a friendly country but it still seems dangerous for that level of technology to go overseas.\u201d  Broadcom, which is based in Singapore, struggled to win CFIUS approval to buy Brocade Communications Systems late last year. In the end, that approval came just weeks after Broadcom CEO Hock Tan announced in an Oval Office ceremony with Trump that Broadcom would return its headquarters to the United States.  Lawyers who take deals to CFIUS and know how the panel thinks said that it was unusual, if not unprecedented, for a company to move to the United States to avoid CFIUS scrutiny. But they also said that the strategy could work.  \u201cBroadcom could very well establish its position as a U.S. person,\u201d one expert said privately to protect business relationships. \u201cWould CFIUS want to look at it? They would want to be comfortable that Broadcom is actually a U.S. person within the meaning of the statute.\u201d  Others cautioned that CFIUS could also look at the make-up of Broadcom\u2019s board and who the major shareholders are as a way to determine if control of the company resides outside the United States.","65":"(Reuters) - President Donald Trump's dramatic intervention in Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd's AVGO.O $117 billion hostile bid for U.S. semiconductor peer Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O is the latest reminder to investment bankers not to take lucrative fees on transformative mergers for granted under his administration.

If that deal closes, AT&T's adviser, Perella Weinberg Partners, will receive an estimated $80 million, Freeman said, while Time Warner's advisers, Allen & Co, Citigroup Inc C.N and Morgan Stanley MS.N, will receive $140 million, according to regulatory filings.  To be sure, the Trump administration\u2019s overall track record is not hostile to mergers. Deal activity continues to be robust, with U.S. merger and acquisition volumes reaching $389 billion so far this year, compared with $236.5 billion in the same period a year ago, as companies have been emboldened by U.S. tax reform to pursue big deals.  What is more, banks typically do receive some small portion of the full fees if deals fall through. In the case of Broadcom, the banks could now receive an estimated $20 million, according to Freeman.  However, the high-profile dealmaking casualties illustrate how Trump\u2019s pro-business rhetoric has not always translated into smooth sailing for the regulatory approval of deals.  Investment bankers' nerves are about to be tested further, as more transformative deals make their way through the regulatory review process. Walt Disney Co's DIS.N $52.4 billion acquisition of assets from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOXA.O, CVS Health Corp's CVS.N $69 billion deal to buy health insurer Aetna Inc AET.N and U.S. health insurer Cigna Corp's CI.N $52 billion agreement to buy pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co ESRX.O will be subjected to intense regulatory scrutiny later this year.","66":"(Reuters) - Cybersecurity company Symantec Corp SYMC.O has walked away from negotiations to sell itself to chipmaker Broadcom Inc AVGO.O over price disagreements, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Symantec\u2019s decision raises new questions over the future of the U.S. antivirus software provider, which is looking for a new CEO and has been struggling to grow its business serving companies.  It could not be determined why the price negotiations broke down. Broadcom was last week willing to offer as much as $28.25 per share in cash for Symantec and was hoping to ink a deal on Monday, one of the sources said. CNBC, which first reported the news on Monday, said Symantec was looking for more than $28 per share.  It is possible that talks between the two sides resume, the sources said. However, Symantec has a track record of exploring a sale, only subsequently to walk away from a deal.  Prior to reaching a deal with Starboard Value LP last year that gave it representation on Symantec\u2019s board, the Mountain View, California-based company explored going private, according to the sources.  Symantec also held talks last year with private equity firm Thoma Bravo LLC about a leveraged buyout, Reuters reported at the time. Two other private equity firms, Silver Lake Partners LP and Bain Capital LP, are investors in Symantec and each have a seat on its board.  The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Broadcom and Symantec did not respond to requests for comment.  Symantec\u2019s shares fell 12% to $22.43 in Monday morning trading, giving it a market value of $14 billion. Broadcom shares were up 2% at $291.32.  Symantec is struggling with severe competition from nimbler rivals. Several top executives, including CEO Greg Clark, have left the company this year, and it is also being investigated by U.S. regulators over an accounting irregularity.  Symantec completed its $2.3 billion acquisition of LifeLock Inc in 2017, a move aimed at bolstering its consumer security business. That followed the purchase of Blue Coat Inc for $4.65 billion in 2016, which expanded its product line for large corporations.  Broadcom, whose chips power smartphones, computers and networking equipment, is trying to diversify into software after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration last year scuttled its $117 billion bid to buy mobile chipmaker Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O.  The Symantec deal would have followed Broadcom\u2019s $18.9 acquisition of U.S. business software company CA Inc last year.  \u201cBroadcom buys software companies, that\u2019s their strategy. If this falls apart, they\u2019ll buy something else at some point,\u201d said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein.  (The story has been refiled to add dropped word in penultimate paragraph)","67":"(Reuters) - Broadcom Inc said on Thursday demand for microchips had hit a bottom and would remain at current levels, a sign that an industry downturn may linger, and added that there was no clear indication as to when the recovery would take place.  FILE PHOTO: A sign to the campus offices of chipmaker Broadcom Ltd is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., November 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The chip industry has been in a slowdown with research firm Gartner forecasting a 9.6% drop in global semiconductor revenue to $429 billion in 2019. U.S.-China trade tensions, including tariffs on some products and the restrictions on sales to Huawei, have been pressuring chipmakers.  \u201c...There is not much clarity or visibility yet, or certainty that any sharp recovery is around the corner,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said on a post-earnings call.  He said the company is managing its chip business with an expectation that it will continue to operate in a \u201cvery low growth, uncertain macro environment\u201d for the foreseeable future.  Shares of Broadcom fell 1.5% in extended trading.  Revenue from the company\u2019s semiconductor solutions segment fell about 5% to $4.35 billion from a year ago.  Total net revenue rose to $5.52 billion in the third quarter ended Aug. 4 from $5.06 billion, but missed analysts average estimate of $5.54 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The chipmaker also maintained its full-year 2019 revenue forecast of $22.50 billion, saying that although the U.S.-China trade conflict continues, it had not seen further deterioration in its business, both globally and in China.  \u201cOur industry checks point to a modest demand recovery in the second half of 2019 but we think it is appropriate for Broadcom to provide a cautious outlook at this juncture due to the uncertainty caused by the trade friction,\u201d Summit Insights Group analyst Kinngai Chan said.  Through a string of big-money acquisitions, the latest being a $10.7 billion proposed deal to buy Symantec Corp\u2019s enterprise security unit, Tan has propelled the chipmaker that was worth just a few billions to a market capitalization of about $118 billion in the period that he has been at the helm.  After its move to buy peer Qualcomm Inc in what would have been the biggest-ever technology deal was blocked, Broadcom acquired software maker CA Technologies for $19 billion to diversify its revenue stream.  Net income attributable to common stock fell to $715 million, or $1.71 per share, in the quarter, from $1.2 billion, or $2.71 per share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, Broadcom earned a profit of $5.16 per share, beating estimates of a profit of $5.13 per share.","68":"(Reuters) - U.S. semiconductor company Qualcomm Inc should try to negotiate a sale to Broadcom Ltd following the latter\u2019s sweetened $121 billion offer, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) said.  FILE PHOTO: A sign on the Qualcomm campus is seen in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Qualcomm has been seeking to walk a fine line between resisting Broadcom\u2019s acquisition approach, which it says undervalues it and is fraught with regulatory risks, and demonstrating to shareholders and proxy advisory firms such as ISS that it is willing to engage to secure a better deal if possible.  In a report published late on Friday, ISS recommended to Qualcomm shareholders that they vote for four out of the six board director nominees that Broadcom has put forward for election at Qualcomm\u2019s shareholder meeting on March 6.  While this recommendation would fall short of Broadcom\u2019s nominees winning a majority on Qualcomm\u2019s 11-member board, ISS said such a vote by Qualcomm shareholders would offer a reasonable path to a negotiated deal that would deliver value.  \u201cThe tenor of (Qualcomm\u2019s) engagement leading up to the present raises questions as to whether the incumbent (Qualcomm) board is committed to playing its part in attempting to maximize the offer,\u201d ISS said in its report.  Broadcom first unveiled an unsolicited $70 per share cash-and-stock offer in November, which Qualcomm rejected. It raised its offer to $82 per share in cash and stock on Feb. 5 and offered other concessions, including paying an $8 billion breakup fee in the event regulators thwart the deal, which would be the technology sector\u2019s largest-ever acquisition.  ISS said it did not recommend voting for all six Broadcom nominees because Qualcomm\u2019s board would then be less inclined to drive a hard bargain with Broadcom in deal negotiations. ISS recommended that Broadcom nominees Samih Elhage, Julie Hill, John Kispert and Harry You should be elected as Qualcomm board directors.  Qualcomm on Friday called a Feb. 14 meeting with Broadcom constructive and opened the door to more talks, but continued to reject the proposed deal.  As of Saturday afternoon, no new meeting between the two companies had been scheduled, according to people familiar with the matter. Broadcom and Qualcomm representatives offered no immediate comment.  The takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd use their market dominance to negotiate lower chip prices.  Singapore-based Broadcom is mainly a manufacturer whose connectivity chips are used in products ranging from mobile phones to servers. San Diego-based Qualcomm primarily outsources the manufacturing of its chips which are used for the delivery of broadband and data, a business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology.  ISS said in its report that Broadcom\u2019s latest $82 per share cash-and-stock bid, which Broadcom CEO Hock Tan has called its best and final offer, does not appear to be clearly superior to Qualcomm\u2019s potential standalone value in the short term. ISS added, however, that the offer seemed to represent a reasonable starting point for negotiations.  Even though both companies \u201chave adopted strategies that do not lend themselves to fluid negotiations,\u201d a deal between them is possible, ISS said. It suggested that Qualcomm shareholders could gain greater exposure to the deal\u2019s potential upside if they were to receive more of the combined company.  ISS also said it appeared more likely than not that Broadcom and Qualcomm, with their collective experience and resources, can find a reasonable path to regulatory approval, despite Qualcomm\u2019s current concerns about antitrust risk.  NXP DEAL  Qualcomm is currently seeking to complete a $38 billion deal to acquire NXP Semiconductors NV, which is still pending regulatory approval. NXP shares ended trading on Friday at $118.50, significantly above Qualcomm\u2019s $110 per share all-cash offer, as some NXP shareholders, led by activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, have called on Qualcomm to raise its price.  Broadcom has said its acquisition offer is contingent on either Qualcomm buying NXP at currently disclosed terms of $110 per share in cash or the deal being terminated.  ISS said in its report that Qualcomm could negotiate provisions with Broadcom to close the NXP deal at a mutually agreed price, which would provide Qualcomm with the \u201cnext-best safety net of diversification\u201d in the event the deal with Broadcom falls through.  China\u2019s MOFCOM is the only regulator globally required to approve the Qualcomm-NXP deal that has yet to do so. With the start of the Chinese New Year public holiday this week, Qualcomm may now delay its decision on raising its offer for NXP until after the March 6 Qualcomm shareholder meeting.","69":"(Repeats story first published on March 5, no change to text)  March 5 (Reuters) - A U.S. national security panel\u2019s unusual decision to review Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd\u2019s $117 billion hostile bid for smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm Ltd illustrates an expanding focus on the competitiveness of the U.S. semiconductor industry amid advances by China, regulatory experts said.  The secretive panel, called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), has scuppered several attempts by Chinese technology companies to acquire U.S. chipmakers in the last 12 months over concerns about the transfer of potentially sensitive technology.  Broadcom is not a Chinese company, and has pledged to move its domicile from Singapore to the United States, arguing this will makes its acquisition of Qualcomm not covered by CFIUS. However, many of Qualcomm\u2019s rivals, including Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, are Chinese.  Huawei is forging closer commercial ties with big telecommunication operators across Asia, the Americas and Europe, putting the company in prime position to lead the global race for wireless 5G networks, despite U.S. allegations it poses a security threat.  CFIUS views Qualcomm as a prized U.S. asset in the development of 5G wireless technology, which allows for the transmission of data at very fast speeds. It wants to make sure Qualcomm does not lose its status as a dominant player in wireless chip technology, according to a source familiar with the panel\u2019s thinking.  As a result, Broadcom\u2019s business plan for Qualcomm, including any divestitures it plans in order to appease antitrust regulators, will be scrutinized by CFIUS, lawyers who advised companies on their CFIUS applications said.  \u201cThis shows how indirect exposure to China is a frequent, but under-noticed, source of perceived national security risk,\u201d said Mario Mancuso, a former CFIUS member who is now a partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP.  CFIUS\u2019 stance has toughened as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to pressure China to help tackle North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions and be more accommodative on trade and foreign exchange issues.  Unfilled political vacancies in several government departments and agencies have also made it harder for CFIUS to approve deals.  Canyon Bridge Capital Partners LLC, a U.S.-based private equity firm funded by the Chinese government, saw its $1.3 billion acquisition of U.S. chipmaker Lattice Semiconductor Corp collapse last year after it was blocked by CFIUS, a rejection subsequently upheld by Trump.  Last month, U.S. semiconductor testing company Xcerra Corp said CFIUS had blocked its $580 million sale to a Chinese state-backed semiconductor investment fund.  Reuters reported last week that CFIUS had begun looking at Broadcom\u2019s bid as pressure grew from politicians, including senior Republican U.S. Senator John Cornyn.  \u201cQualcomm is a leader in 5G technology, which is going to be the new standard in the future. And, as we\u2019ve seen, some of our international rivals, like China, have been incredibly aggressive and strategic,\u201d Cornyn said on Monday. He has proposed legislation to tighten CFIUS\u2019 scrutiny of deals.  PROXY CONTEST  CFIUS\u2019 intervention was unusual in that the panel typically reviews signed deals. However, Qualcomm has been resisting Broadcom\u2019s overtures, prompting the latter to nominate six directors to Qualcomm\u2019s 11-member board at its shareholder meeting. CFIUS on Sunday ordered Qualcomm to postpone its shareholder meeting, which was scheduled for Tuesday, for a month.  Qualcomm filed a voluntary request for CFIUS to review Broadcom\u2019s bid on Jan. 29. CFIUS rules allow a company facing an unsolicited takeover bid to request a CFIUS review, so that its board of directors can better assess the regulatory risk of a deal.  \u201cThe rules say that one party alone could approach CFIUS and for a review,\u201d said McDermott Will & Emery LLP regulatory lawyer David Levine.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Intel's competitive concern about Broadcom's attempt to buy mobile chip rival Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O had led it to consider a range of acquisitions in response, including a bid for Broadcom.  In response to an inquiry about the Journal\u2019s report, Intel said it does not comment on \u201crumors or speculation\u201d related to mergers and acquisitions but that it is focused on its previous acquisitions.  \u201cWe have made important acquisitions over the past 30 months - including Mobileye and Altera - and our focus is on integrating those acquisitions and making them successful for our customers and shareholders,\u201d Intel said in a statement to Reuters. Intel acquired autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye last year and acquired programmable chip maker Altera in late 2015.  Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Shares of Broadcom rose 3.6 percent to $262.93 in after hours trade on Friday. Qualcomm and Intel each fell less than 1 percent, to $62.87 and $51.84, respectively.  Singapore-based Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion bid for Qualcomm faces concerns by U.S. regulators worried about potential Chinese influence on the company and U.S. ability to influence the creation of the next generation of mobile networks, called 5G.  Qualcomm has sought assurances from Broadcom over potential antitrust issues.  Intel is mostly known for making chips that are the brains of personal computers and data centers, though it has made progress gaining smart phone manufacturing customers such as Apple Inc AAPL.O.  If Broadcom buys Qualcomm, Intel would face a much bigger competitor, nearly equal to itself in market heft.  Broadcom and Qualcomm are worth close to $100 billion each and a combination would be the biggest tech deal ever. An Intel deal would be significantly bigger, since its market capitalization alone is nearly $240 billion.  The Journal reported that Intel had been considering a Broadcom bid since late last year and was working with advisers, although the newspaper said one of its sources described a bid as unlikely given the complexity of the combination.  Still, antitrust consultant Linley Gwennap said Intel likely could convince regulators to allow it to take over Broadcom, despite the size, since the companies largely make different types of microchips.

Data from China showed industrial output growth in the world\u2019s second largest economy slowed to a more than 17-year low in May, sending a chill through stock market investors globally.  Nasdaq 100 e-minis pointed to a 59.5 point fall, or 0.79% fall at opening while Dow e-minis slid 52 points, or 0.2%, and S&P 500 e-minis 8.75 points, or 0.3%.  The S&P has gained about 5% in June so far on hopes the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates soon to combat slowing global growth, a stark contrast to the steady path of monetary tightening it was on until the end of last year.  The Broadcom news was one of the clearest indications yet from the trade-sensitive tech sector of the scale of pain companies can expect from Washington\u2019s stand-off with China.  Semiconductors stocks, who both source product and sell heavily in China, tumbled, with Intel Corp, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Micron Technology Inc down between 2.2% and 4%. Shares of Apple Inc also slipped 1.2%.  A Fed meeting next week may provide the acid test of market expectations that the U.S. central bank could cut rates as much as three times this year, while a Group of 20 summit at the end of the month may yet yield more progress on a trade deal.  In the latest salvo between the two sides, China said on Friday it was raising anti-dumping duties on certain alloy-steel seamless tubes and pipes from the United States and the European Union by as much as 10 times.  On the macro front, the Commerce Department\u2019s report on retail sales for May is expected to show a 0.6% rise at 8:30 a.m. ET, following a 0.2% drop in April.

Broadcom\u2019s board was meeting on Tuesday night to formalize its plans and it could make an announcement as soon as Wednesday, the two sources added. The company will also drop its challenge to Qualcomm\u2019s board, the people added.  Broadcom will continue with its plan to redomicile to the United States, a move that will cost it about $500 million a year under a higher tax rate, the sources added.  Being based in the United States as opposed to Singapore will allow Broadcom to make what it believes will be acquisitions of U.S. companies that will not fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which scrutinizes deals for potential national security concerns.  Broadcom and Qualcomm could not be immediately reached for comment.  DEAD DEAL  Trump signed an order late on Monday to halt what would have been the biggest-ever technology deal on concerns that a takeover of Qualcomm by the Singapore-based company would erode the United States\u2019 lead in mobile technology and give China the upper hand.  The deal, spearheaded by CEO Hock Tan, would have created the world\u2019s No. 3 semiconductor company with a leading market share in smartphones, car electronics and industrial internet devices.  Analysts said Broadcom can still build heft through smaller deals. And it could have an easier time buying U.S. targets if it goes through with plans to redomicilie in the United States.  Tan has already turned Avago, a small chipmaker with a market value of $3.5 billion in 2009, into a more than $100 billion company.  Tan bought California-based companies Broadcom for $37 billion in a leveraged deal in 2015 and Brocade Communications in a $5.5 billion deal two years later.  San Diego-based Qualcomm evolved from a U.S. military aerospace contractor to become the dominant player in wireless radio technology over the past two decades, with its chips used in half of all smartphones.  It fended off antitrust concerns around the globe over its intellectual property strategies, taking the biggest share of wireless royalties in the 3G and 4G eras and getting a head start on next decade\u2019s 5G era, which promises to embed wireless connections in cars, factories, homes and cities.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  SMALLER BITES  Broadcom now has ample firepower for smaller deals, with about $11 billion in cash and the potential to generate nearly $9 billion in annual free cash flow, analysts estimate.  CFIUS, which raised concerns about the Qualcomm deal with Trump, listed the highly leveraged nature of Broadcom\u2019s bid for its larger rival as a major concern coupled with the risk of the U.S. losing mobile technology leadership.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Broadcom had planned since last year to relocate its legal headquarters to the United States, avoiding the need for a CFIUS review.  \u201cIf Broadcom completes its redomiciling in the U.S. in a way that extinguishes any non-U.S. ownership or control, then I think they can open the door to many, if not all, acquisitions ... they would effectively no longer be subject to a CFIUS-initiated review or investigation,\u201d said Guillermo Christensen, a lawyer who works on CFIUS issues at Brown Rudnick in Washington.  \u201cBut that really hinges on completely severing the foreign ownership connection,\u201d he said.","81":"March 12 (Reuters) - Broadcom Inc:  * ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 2020 FINANCIAL RESULTS, QUARTERLY DIVIDEND AND UPDATED GUIDANCE  * SEES Q2 REVENUE ABOUT $5.7 BILLION PLUS OR MINUS $150 MILLION  * Q1 NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE $5.25  * Q1 GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE $0.74  * Q1 REVENUE $5.858 BILLION VERSUS REFINITIV IBES ESTIMATE OF $6 BILLION  * Q1 EARNINGS PER SHARE ESTIMATE $5.33 -- REFINITIV IBES DATA  * WITHDRAWING PRIOR ANNUAL GUIDANCE, IN LIGHT OF UNCERTAINTIES ARISING FROM EFFECTS OF COVID-19  * SEES SECOND QUARTER REVENUE GUIDANCE OF $5.7 BILLION PLUS OR MINUS $150 MILLION  * BROADCOM - DID NOT SEE ANY MATERIAL IMPACT ON BUSINESSES DUE TO COVID-19 IN Q1  * Q2 ADJUSTED EBITDA GUIDANCE OF $3,135 MILLION PLUS OR MINUS $75 MILLION  * SEES Q2 ADJUSTED EBITDA OF $3,135 MILLION PLUS OR MINUS $75 MILLION, OR 55% OF REVENUE AT THE MIDPOINT OF GUIDANCE  * QUARTERLY COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND OF $3.25 PER SHARE  * VISIBILITY IN GLOBAL MARKETS IS LACKING AND DEMAND UNCERTAINTY IS INTENSIFYING  * BELIEVE IT PRUDENT TO WITHDRAW ANNUAL GUIDANCE UNTIL VISIBILITY RETURNS TO PRE COVID-19 LEVELS  * ARE WELL POSITIONED TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT DIVIDENDS TO STOCKHOLDERS DESPITE CHALLENGING MARKET BACKDROP Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","82":"(Reuters) - Broadcom Inc withdrew its revenue forecast for 2020 on Thursday, joining a host of chipmakers that have either cut or pulled their sales outlook due to demand and supply disruptions caused by the coronavirus outbreak.

The Wall Street Journal had reported in December that Broadcom is working with Credit Suisse to sell its radio frequency segment in a process that is at an early stage.  Tan said the company will supply radio frequency components for next three generations of 5G phones for its top customer, which analysts believe to be Apple.

Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion offer to buy California-based Qualcomm is being reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) for potential national security threats.  Broadcom said such security concerns were not a risk to the closure of the proposed buyout as it never planned to finish the deal before completing moving its official base to the United States.  Broadcom is incorporated in Singapore and co-headquartered there and in San Jose, California.  Broadcom said last week that CFIUS has ordered the company to provide it with five business days\u2019 notice before taking any action toward moving base to the United States.  The requirement showed that CFIUS, an inter-agency panel led by the U.S. Treasury, was aware that its jurisdiction could be contested if Broadcom redomiciles to the United States.  CFIUS had delayed Qualcomm\u2019s annual meeting by a month to April 5. In that meeting, shareholders will also vote for Broadcom\u2019s slate of six nominees for Qualcomm\u2019s 11-member board.  Since disclosing its first bid, worth $103 billion, for Qualcomm on Nov. 6, Broadcom has revised its bid twice, but is yet to strike a deal.  Days before the first bid in November, U.S. President Donald Trump said Broadcom planned to redomicile to the United States from Singapore.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The meeting comes after Broadcom raised its cash-and-stock offer last week from $70 to $82 per share, and made other concessions, including offering to pay Qualcomm an $8 billion breakup fee should antitrust regulators block the deal.  Qualcomm said last Thursday that Broadcom\u2019s new offer still undervalues it and falls well short of the firm commitments on regulatory issues it expected. However, it offered to meet Broadcom to see if it can address what it called \u201cserious deficiencies in value and certainty in its proposal.\u201d  As part of its bid to take over Qualcomm, Broadcom has also launched a campaign with Qualcomm shareholders to replace Qualcomm\u2019s board. Both companies are due to meet proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis before their Feb. 14 meeting to argue why Qualcomm shareholders should back them in a vote scheduled for March 6.  Broadcom had requested last week to meet over the weekend, but has now agreed to meet on Wednesday instead, the sources said on Sunday, asking not to be identified because the meeting\u2019s details are not public.  Qualcomm and Broadcom did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd use their market dominance to negotiate down chip prices.  Singapore-based Broadcom is mainly a manufacturer whose connectivity chips are used in products ranging from mobile phones to servers. San Diego-based Qualcomm primarily licenses its technology for the delivery of broadband and data, a business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology.  Broadcom\u2019s antitrust counsel, Daniel Wall of Latham & Watkins LLP, said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last week that Broadcom was willing to sell two Qualcomm businesses to resolve any antitrust problems. These are its Wi-Fi networking processors and RF Front End chips for mobile phones.  Qualcomm responded on Thursday that unless Broadcom will agree to do whatever is necessary to ensure the deal closes, a commitment to divestitures without restrictions often referred to as \u201chell or high water\u201d, it would have to be extremely clear and specific about what actions it would refuse to take.  Broadcom CEO Hock Tan told Reuters in an interview last week that Broadcom decided not to offer hell-or-high-water provisions to Qualcomm because it does not view them as a very well defined legal standard.","87":"April 6 (Reuters) - Broadcom Inc:  * BROADCOM INC - ARE EXPERIENCING SOME DISRUPTION TO PARTS OF OUR GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN  * BROADCOM INC - OUR MALAYSIA WAREHOUSE IS CURRENTLY FULLY OPERATIONAL, PURSUANT TO A CRITICAL INDUSTRY EXEMPTION  * BROADCOM- ANY INCREASE IN SEVERITY OF COVID-19 OUTBREAK\/GOVERNMENT MEASURES RESTRICTING MOVEMENT IN TAIWAN MAY CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL DISRUPTION TO TSMC\u2019S OPERATIONS  * BROADCOM- TO DATE, IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON DEMAND ENVIRONMENT FOR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS HAS BEEN LIMITED  * BROADCOM- ANY INCREASE IN SEVERITY IN COVID-19 OUTBREAK\/GOVERNMENT MEASURES IN FORT COLLINS, COLARADO WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT WIRELESS BUSINESS  * BROADCOM- DEMAND ENVIRONMENT FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS HAS BEEN CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT EXPECTATIONS DURING Q2 TO DATE Source text for Eikon: [ID:bit.ly\/2Re6IDY] Further company coverage:","88":"March 14 (Reuters) - Broadcom Ltd:  * BROADCOM WITHDRAWS OFFER TO ACQUIRE QUALCOMM  * BROADCOM WITHDRAWS OFFER TO ACQUIRE QUALCOMM  * BROADCOM LTD - WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH ITS REDOMICILIATION PROCESS  * BROADCOM LTD - HAS WITHDRAWN ITS SLATE OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR NOMINEES FOR QUALCOMM\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDER  * BROADCOM LTD - WILL HOLD ITS SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS AS PLANNED ON MARCH 23, 2018  * BROADCOM LTD - \u201cAPPRECIATES\u201d STATEMENT FROM U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY AND CFIUS CHAIR STEVEN MNUCHIN ON MARCH 12  * BROADCOM LTD - \u201cALTHOUGH WE ARE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS OUTCOME, BROADCOM WILL COMPLY WITH ORDER\u201d Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","89":"March 9 (Reuters) - Intel Corp is considering a range of acquisition options that could include a possible bid for Broadcom Ltd, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Broadcom expects to continue with its plan to redomicile to the United States.  Here are the important developments that have taken place since Broadcom made its first bid to buy Qualcomm:  March 13  - A dozen banks that signed on to provide a record $100 billion bridge loan to back Broadcom\u2019s planned $117 billion takeover of Qualcomm will earn starkly less than planned for extending credit to the chipmaker after President Trump blocked the deal over national security concerns.  - Senator Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the U.S. Senate, praised Trump\u2019s decision, calling China\u2019s trade practices \u201crapacious.\u201d  - Broadcom, led by dynamic Chief Executive Hock Tan, is unlikely to put the brakes on an acquisition spree after its $117 billion bid for Qualcomm Inc was blocked by President Trump on national security grounds.  That was the immediate reaction from Wall Street\u2019s tech sector analysts to Trump\u2019s surprise intervention to block what would have been the biggest ever tech merger.  March 12  - President Trump signed an order to halt the deal on concerns that a takeover of Qualcomm by the Singapore-based company would erode the United States\u2019 lead in mobile technology and give China the upper hand.  - Broadcom violated an order from a national security panel in a bid to push for a merger with Qualcomm, the U.S. Treasury Department said in a letter.  The letter said that Broadcom \u201ctook a series of actions in violation\u201d of a previous order from Treasury.  - Broadcom said it expects to redomicile to the United States by April 3.  March 9  - Microchip maker Intel Corp responded to a news report that it is considering a possible bid for Broadcom by saying that it is focused on integrating previous acquisitions, raising doubt over the idea.  The Wall Street Journal reported that Intel\u2019s competitive concern about Broadcom\u2019s attempt to buy Qualcomm had led it to consider a range of acquisitions in response, including a bid for Broadcom.  - A U.S. national security panel ordered Broadcom to provide it with five business days\u2019 notice before taking any action toward redomiciling to the United States, a regulatory filing revealed.  The previously undisclosed requirement shows that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies for potential national security risks, is aware that its jurisdiction could be contested if Broadcom redomiciles to the United States.  - Broadcom promised not to sell critical national security assets to foreign buyers if its deal for Qualcomm is approved, another effort by the firm to appease U.S. security concerns.  Separately, Qualcomm said it discontinued the role of executive chairman and named a new non-executive chairman.  March 7  Broadcom sought again to soothe U.S. security concerns around its bid for Qualcomm, saying it would stick with investments aimed at maintaining the United States\u2019 leadership in 5G technology.  CFIUS, in an unusual move, stepped into Broadcom\u2019s hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm this week, citing a number of concerns on the development of the next generation of mobile networks and technology.  March 6  CFIUS identified potential risks that warrant a full investigation of Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm, a senior U.S. Treasury official said in a letter to the companies.  Some of the U.S. government\u2019s concerns relate to risks associated with Broadcom\u2019s relationships with foreign entities, Aimen Mir, the Treasury\u2019s deputy assistant secretary for investment security, said in the letter, without identifying who those parties might be.  The letter was dated March 5 and made public by Qualcomm.  Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported that Qualcomm is in talks to settle a patent dispute with China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co and could reach an agreement in the coming weeks, citing people familiar with the matter.  March 5  Broadcom said the decision by CFIUS to review the deal was the result of secret moves made by Qualcomm on Jan. 29 to encourage an investigation into the offer.  Qualcomm said it was delaying its 2018 annual meeting to April 5 as a result of the CFIUS order.  Separately, Qualcomm, which is awaiting China\u2019s MOFCOM approval for the $44 billion deal to buy NXP Semiconductors NV, extended the tender offer to March 9 from March 5.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  (Reuters) - Broadcom Inc on Thursday released a new chip aimed at eliminating choppy phone calls and music on Bluetooth headphones.  The San Jose, California-based company is a major supplier to high-end smart phone makers such as Apple Inc, with whom it has signed deals to supply as much as $15 billion worth of chips.  The Broadcom chip released on Thursday handles Wi-Fi and Bluetooth wireless communication functions in devices such as smart phones. The Bluetooth portion of the chip uses two radios in tandem to communicate with devices such as headphones.  Vijay Nagarajan, vice president of Broadcom\u2019s mobile connectivity division, said the technology is meant to prevent choppy calls and music listening when walking into crowded areas like subway platforms, where Bluetooth signals from other people\u2019s devices can cause interference and dropouts.  \u201cWe\u2019re making your wireless link from your phone to the headset more resilient,\u201d Nagarajan told Reuters.  The Bluetooth chips also keep one of their radios in a low-power mode so that it can stay on all the time to \u201clisten\u201d for devices trying to connect to a mobile phone, a feature meant to help wireless headphones connect faster.  The chip will also support Wi-Fi 6E, a new version of the common wireless standard that is expected to be much faster than previous versions if both a phone and a Wi-Fi router have new chips that support it. But before the technology can be used, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission must finalize its 2018 move to open up the use of 6-gigahertz spectrum.  If U.S. regulators open the spectrum in the next several months, Nagarajan said devices with the new chips could come to market as early as this fall.","97":"March 7 (Reuters) - Broadcom Ltd:  * REGARDING ITS OFFER TO BUY QUALCOMM, WILL MAINTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES QUALCOMM DEVOTES TO 5G  * PLEDGING TO CREATE A NEW $1.5 BILLION FUND TO TRAIN AND EDUCATE ENGINEERS IN U.S.  * WILL ALSO FOCUS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPEND TO QUALCOMM\u2019S 5G TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE \u201cESSENTIAL TO THE U.S.\u201d  * SAYS \u201cTHERE IS NO TRUTH TO QUALCOMM\u2019S ARGUMENT THAT ITS ANTICOMPETITIVE LICENSING PRACTICES ARE NEEDED TO FUND A ROBUST RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORT\u201d Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","98":"LONDON\/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Broadcom Inc sent a shockwave through the global chipmaking industry on Friday with its forecast that U.S.-China trade tensions and the ban on doing business with Huawei Technologies would knock $2 billion off the company\u2019s sales this year.  The forecast, included in the company\u2019s second-quarter results late on Thursday, was the hardest evidence yet of the damage President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with Beijing may do to the global industry.  Shares in Broadcom fell as much as 8.6%, wiping more than $9 billion off the market value of the company, previously based in Asia but now with its headquarters and main listing in the United States.  U.S. chipmakers Qualcomm, Applied Materials Inc, Intel Corp, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Xilinx Inc were all down between 1.5% and 3%.  The Philadelphia chip index was down nearly 3% with 29 of its 30 components trading lower. Shares of other Huawei suppliers like Analog Devices Inc, Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo Inc also fell.  European peers including STMicroelectronics, Infineon and AMS ended the day lower.  \u201cWe\u2019ll see a very sharp impact simply because (there are) no purchases allowed and there\u2019s no obvious substitution in place,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said on a post-earnings call with analysts on the Huawei ban.  Huawei accounted for about $900 million, or 4%, of the company\u2019s overall sales last year. Broadcom, however, also said the forecast cut \u201cextends beyond one particular customer.\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019re talking about uncertainty in our marketplace, uncertainty because of the - of demand in the form of order reduction as the supply chain out there constricts - compress, so to speak,\u201d Tan said.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  The semiconductor industry has been grappling with slowing demand since the second half of 2018 with bellwether Texas Instruments warning in April that a cyclical downturn could last for another two years.  That has related chiefly to signs that mobile phone markets in some major economies are increasingly saturated while mass demand in new areas like self-driving cars and internet of things devices for homes and offices is still developing.  The geopolitical risks from the trade conflict and Huawei ban are an additional shock.  \u201cIt\u2019s not just Huawei, it\u2019s deeper than that. OEMs [carmakers] aren\u2019t ordering.

Finisar Corp, which makes sensors for facial recognition, transceivers and other components for telecommunication networks, said in a regulatory filing that ban on Huawei could have continuing negative impact on its future revenue. Huawei represented 10% of its total revenue in fiscal 2019.  The CEO of chipmaker Micron Technology also said the ban on Huawei brings uncertainty and disturbance to the semiconductor industry.  Micron will report its third-quarter results on June 25.  \u201cI think you have seen all the companies (Qorvo, Skyworks, Maxlinear, Cree, Inphi, Lumentum, NeoPhotonics) which pre-announced negative for about half their quarter\u2019s impact due to this Huawei export ban,\u201d Chan said.  \u201cThe issue now is that there will be a second degree (indirect) impact as well that most companies do not want to talk about.

The takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc AAPL.O and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS use their market dominance to negotiate lower chip prices.  Broadcom cut its bid last week by 4 percent to $117 billion after Qualcomm's decision to raise its own bid for NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI.O to $44 billion.  Qualcomm\u2019s shares rose 5.8 percent to close Monday\u2019s trading at $66.98, still well below Broadcom\u2019s latest cash-and-stock offer of $79 per share.  Qualcomm also softened its approach to Broadcom\u2019s commitments on regulatory approval for the deal, saying the path forward did not require a \u201chell or high water\u201d commitment to sell any assets that the regulators require.  Qualcomm, however, urged the Singapore-based chipmaker to provide more clarity regarding its plans for Qualcomm\u2019s licensing business, which Broadcom has been unwilling to reveal. It also offered to sign a confidentiality agreement so both companies can carry out due diligence on one another.  \u201cWe are willing to jointly select a law firm with antitrust expertise that you would fully brief on your licensing plans,\u201d Qualcomm said.

Neither side commented on what transpired in the two-hour meeting. Qualcomm said in its statement its board would meet to determine its next steps.  Broadcom\u2019s top executives left the meeting with the impression that their Qualcomm counterparts listened to them but did not engage, according to sources familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because it was private.  The meeting came after Qualcomm rejected Broadcom\u2019s revised cash-and-stock bid of $82 per share last week and said the new offer still undervalued it and fell well short of the firm commitments on regulatory issues it expected.  Qualcomm had said it would take the meeting to allow Broadcom to explain how it would attempt to bridge the gaps in both value and deal certainty and to better understand the issues that remained unaddressed in its proposal.  Qualcomm said last week that Broadcom\u2019s plan to address antitrust concerns by selling two Qualcomm businesses, its Wi-Fi networking processors and RF Front End chips for mobile phones, was inadequate to allay concerns that the deal would not win regulatory approval.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Qualcomm\u2019s response raises the stakes in a battle over what would be the technology sector\u2019s largest-ever acquisition. The two companies have less than three weeks to negotiate a potential deal until Qualcomm shareholders are asked to vote on a challenge by Broadcom to Qualcomm\u2019s board of directors.  Qualcomm has been seeking to walk a fine line between resisting Broadcom\u2019s acquisition approach, which it says undervalues it and is fraught with regulatory risks, and demonstrating to its shareholders and proxy advisory firms that it is willing to engage to secure a better deal if possible.  \u201cWhile the current Broadcom proposal is unacceptable, our board is intensely focused on maximizing value for Qualcomm stockholders, whether through executing on its growth strategy or by selling the company,\u201d Qualcomm Chairman Paul Jacobs wrote to Broadcom CEO Hock Tan on Friday in a letter released by Qualcomm.  Broadcom offered no immediate comment. Qualcomm shares were up 0.4 percent at $65.60, significantly below Broadcom\u2019s latest $82 per share cash-and-stock offer. Broadcom shares were down 0.8 percent at $249.89.  Qualcomm\u2019s meeting with Broadcom on Feb. 14 was the first time the two companies met to discuss a potential combination since Broadcom unveiled its unsolicited bid last November.  As part of the takeover battle, Broadcom is asking Qualcomm shareholders to back its effort to replace a majority of Qualcomm\u2019s board of directors in a vote scheduled for March 6. It has called its latest bid its best and final offer.  \u201cWhile it sounds like the parties remain very far apart on the specifics (price, risk mitigation, etc), actual negotiations (with an understanding of opening positions) do appear to have kicked off, and Qualcomm is at least contemplating the bare possibility that they might get sold,\u201d analyst Stacy Rasgon at Bernstein said.  In the meeting this week, Singapore-based Broadcom was willing to make certain divestitures to satisfy antitrust regulators, but was still resistant to \u201cother commitments that could be expected\u201d to be required by government regulatory bodies, Qualcomm said.  Broadcom has already said it is willing to sell two Qualcomm businesses to resolve any antitrust problems. These are its Wi-Fi networking processors and RF Front End chips for mobile phones.  In the meeting, Broadcom agreed to divest if needed its own Wi-Fi business, instead of Qualcomm\u2019s, a source familiar with the confidential details of the meeting said.  Broadcom also wanted Qualcomm to include in the merger agreement that Qualcomm will refrain from lawsuits related to licensing while the deal is being reviewed by regulators, according to the source. Qualcomm did not agree to that.  Qualcomm reiterated that Broadcom\u2019s promised breakup fee of $8 billion in the event regulators thwart the deal did not come close to compensating for risks related to the deal.  NXP DEAL  The takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc AAPL.O and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS use their market dominance to negotiate down chip prices.  Broadcom is mainly a manufacturer whose connectivity chips are used in products ranging from mobile phones to servers. San Diego-based Qualcomm primarily outsources the manufacturing of its chips which are used for the delivery of broadband and data, a business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology.  Qualcomm is currently seeking to complete a $38 billion deal to acquire NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI.O. NXP shares are trading at around $119, significantly above Qualcomm's $110 per share offer, as some NXP shareholders, led by activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, have called on Qualcomm to raise its price.  Broadcom has said its acquisition offer is contingent on either Qualcomm buying NXP at currently disclosed terms of $110 per share in cash or the deal being terminated.  China\u2019s MOFCOM is the only regulator around the world that has yet to approve the Qualcomm-NXP deal. With the start of the Chinese New Year public holiday this week, Qualcomm could potentially delay its decision on raising its offer for NXP until after the March 6 Qualcomm shareholder meeting.","118":"Feb 16 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc is open to discussing a buyout offer from Broadcom Ltd that \u201creflects the true value\u201d of the chipmaker and better addresses concerns about regulatory hurdles to a deal, the company said on Friday.

Shares of Broadcom Inc plunged 8.6% in premarket trading after it cut its revenue forecast for 2019 by $2 billion, blaming the U.S.-China trade conflict and export curbs on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.  Data from China showed industrial output growth in the world\u2019s second largest economy slowed to a more than 17-year low in May, sending a chill through stock market investors globally.  \u201cBroadcom is definitely leading markets lower and that might drive other chips lower as well. Some of it is also about the U.S.-China trade war and the fight over Huawei,\u201d said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh.  \u201cChina was to be expected because tariffs are having an effect on them and that\u2019s starting to show up.\u201d  At 8:41 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 33 points, or 0.13%. S&P 500 e-minis were down 6.5 points, or 0.22% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 52.5 points, or 0.7%.  The S&P 500 index has gained about 5% in June so far on hopes the Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates, a stark contrast to the steady path of monetary tightening it was on until the end of last year.  The dour forecast from Broadcom was one of the clearest indications yet from the trade-sensitive tech sector of the scale of pain companies can expect from Washington\u2019s stand-off with China.  Semiconductors stocks, who both source product and sell heavily in China, tumbled, with Intel Corp, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Micron Technology Inc down between 2% and 3.2%. Shares of Apple Inc also slipped 1.2%.  A Fed meeting next week may provide the acid test of market expectations that the U.S. central bank could cut rates as much as three times this year, while a G20 summit at the end of the month may yet yield more progress on a trade deal.  Data showed U.S. retail sales increased in May, although slightly below expectations, suggesting a pick-up in consumer spending that could ease fears the domestic economy was slowing down sharply in the second quarter.  In the latest salvo between the two sides, China said on Friday it was raising anti-dumping duties on certain alloy-steel seamless tubes and pipes from the United States and the European Union by as much as 10 times.

Shares of Broadcom Inc fell 5.5% after it cut its full-year revenue forecast by $2 billion, blaming the U.S.-China trade conflict and export curbs on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd .  Shares of Apple Inc also slipped 0.85% and weighed the most on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Broadcom is a major supplier to the iPhone maker.  Losses in chip companies, who both source product and sell heavily in China, dropped sharply. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index tumbled 2.60%.  Adding to China worries, Chinese data pointed to the worst slowdown in industrial growth in 17 years. China\u2019s industrial output growth in May slowed below expectations and showed signs of weakening demand.  A Federal Reserve meeting next week may provide the test of market expectations that the U.S. central bank could cut interest rates as much as three times this year, while a G20 summit at the end of the month may yet yield more progress on a trade deal.  \u201cThe key is going to be any progress with China ...

Stocks are primed for a selloff should the Fed fail to take an even more dovish tilt after policymakers raised expectations for a rate cut in recent weeks.  The S&P 500 index has so far gained 4.9% in June and was on track to record a second straight week of gains on hopes the Fed will soon cut rates.  In a bright spot, data showed U.S. retail sales increased in May and sales for the prior month were revised higher, suggesting a pick-up in consumer spending that could ease fears the economy was slowing down sharply in the second quarter.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The move came following Singapore-based Broadcom\u2019s meeting with proxy advisory firm ISS on Monday and concern from some Qualcomm shareholders that replacing the company\u2019s entire 11-member board could create uncertainty during the time it would take to complete a combination of the two companies.  The move on board seats comes a day ahead of planned talks between the semiconductor companies to discuss Broadcom\u2019s $121 billion cash-and-stock acquisition offer, which will be their first such discussion.  Broadcom said the change would let Qualcomm stockholders direct a simple majority of the board to negotiate a deal while also ensuring that the remaining five directors who are familiar with the company continue to oversee it.  Broadcom\u2019s six nominees are Samih Elhage, David Golden, Veronica Hagen, Julie Hill, John Kispert and Harry You. The company said it would withdraw its offer if it was not accepted by Qualcomm\u2019s executives or unless its six nominees were elected at Qualcomm\u2019s shareholder meeting scheduled for March 6.

San Diego-based Qualcomm primarily licenses its technology for the delivery of broadband and data, a business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology.  The difference in their business models has led to Qualcomm raising concerns that its licensing agreements with customers could be upended should a deal with Broadcom be announced.  It has warned that regulators could take more than 18 months to approve the deal, and may never do so. Broadcom has countered it believes it can complete the deal in 12 months.  Qualcomm has been a supplier of components to Apple for years, but the relationship soured last year when Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refused to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Apple and Qualcomm are now locked in a bitter legal dispute.  Broadcom raised its cash-and-stock offer last week to $82 per share from $70, and made other concessions. They include offering to pay Qualcomm an $8 billion breakup fee should antitrust regulators block the deal.  Qualcomm rejected the revised offer, as it did the first bid, saying the proposal undervalued the company and fell well short of commitments on regulatory issues.","128":"Dec 12 (Reuters) - Broadcom Inc forecast full-year 2020 revenue above Wall Street estimates on Thursday, as the company expects strong demand for its chips from rising 5G adoption.

FILE PHOTO - sign to the campus offices of chip maker Broadcom Ltd is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., November 6, 2017.

Broadcom results beat expectations days after U.S. President Donald Trump blocked its $117 billion hostile bid for Qualcomm on national security concerns. The company scrapped the offer on Wednesday.  Singapore-based Broadcom, however, said it would continue with its plans to redomicile to the United States, fueling expectations that the company would likely scout for smaller targets.  \u201cQualcomm was clearly a unique and very large acquisition opportunity,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Tom Krause told investors on a conference call. \u201cGiven the maturity of the industry, the consolidation it is seeing and our relative size now, our future acquisitions are much more likely to be funded with cash available on our balance sheet and without the need to flex the balance sheet.\u201d  Broadcom\u2019s shares were down 1.2 percent at $264.50 in extended trading on Thursday.  \u201cTypically, Broadcom has to make acquisitions to drive the earnings,\u201d said Summit Insight Group analyst Kinngai Chan. \u201cIf the company is able to make two or three medium-size acquisitions, then I think the stock will move up again.\u201d  But Broadcom officials were still publicly smarting over the loss of the Qualcomm deal. Krause said he was \u201ctouched\u201d by an Institutional Shareholder Services report Wednesday encouraging Qualcomm shareholders to cast protest ballots for Broadcom\u2019s director nominees.  Krause said Broadcom believes that \u201cbased on the vote tally as of today, the 11 Qualcomm nominees are only garnering between 15 percent to 16 percent of the outstanding shares, not necessarily something to celebrate on San Diego.\u201d Qualcomm declined to comment on Krause\u2019s comments.  Broadcom, whose WiFi chips are found in Apple Inc's AAPL.O iPhone and most Android phones, was eyeing Qualcomm's core baseband chips and license business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology.  Broadcom said first-quarter smart phone results were driven by an increase in orders from a \"North American smartphone customer,\" which most analysts believe is Apple Inc AAPL.O, which released its flagship iPhone X later than normal last year, pushing production into the early part of this year.  CEO Hock Tan said that customer\u2019s business was expected to \u201ctrend down sharply\u201d in the second quarter, partially offset at Broadcom by more business for a \u201cnext-generation flagship [phone] from a large Korean smartphone customer.\u201d  Net income attributable to ordinary shares surged to $6.23 billion, or $14.62 per share, in the first quarter ended Feb. 4, from $239 million, or 57 cents per share, a year earlier.
