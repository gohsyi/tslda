a wireless carrier to a media and advertising powerhouse.  FILE PHOTO: The company logo for AT&T is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 18, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  AT&T has spent more than $135 billion to stitch together a media company, satellite TV provider and advertising platform to grow its business. But it has faced skepticism from investors.  The discussions come as AT&T\u2019s new chief executive, John Stankey, reviews the conglomerate\u2019s assets in an attempt to reduce nearly $152 billion in net debt.  The talks on selling Xandr are in the early stages and may not necessarily result in a sale. The company intends to keep Crunchyroll, the popular anime streaming site, as it fits its content strategy, the source added.  AT&T declined to comment. Shares of the company were down 1.5% at midday on Tuesday.  The Wall Street Journal first reported the potential sale earlier on Tuesday.  Selling Xandr, \"really puts a nail in the coffin of this whole idea that there is money to be made for [telecom companies] in marketing,\" said Tal Chalozin, chief technology officer and founder of ad tech firm Innovid. AT&T rival Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N has also struggled to make money from its acquisitions spree that led to the formation of Verizon Media.  AT&T launched Xandr in 2018 after buying ad tech firm AppNexus for $1.6 billion to offer partners a better way to target ads at consumers using data collected from phone, internet and TV services.  A sale of Xandr would be particularly difficult right now, given its large size and growing regulatory concerns in the industry, said Ari Paparo, chief executive of ad tech firm Beeswax and a former executive at AppNexus.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of doubt and skepticism over the digital ad space,\u201d he said. \u201cThat puts a lot of question marks on the business.\u201d  Ad agency executives who spoke with Reuters earlier this year have viewed Xandr\u2019s progress as slow, citing few new product offerings for advertisers since its launch.  Xandr is continuing to work on new deals with other media owners to sell portions of their ad inventory through Xandr\u2019s marketplace, according to a person familiar with the matter.","2":"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday gave a ringing endorsement to AT&T Inc\u2019s planned acquisition of Time Warner Inc without any conditions, opening the door for companies such as Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc to pursue deals to buy creators of media content.  The ruling by Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia brings an end to a six-week antitrust trial in which U.S. regulators argued that the $85 billion deal would give AT&T undue leverage against rival cable providers that relied on Time Warner\u2019s content.  The judge\u2019s strong approval, and scathing opinion that urged the government not to seek a stay if they opposed the ruling, will give telecommunications providers the confidence that similar types of acquisitions will also have a shot at clearing regulatory hurdles, and could spur other copycat mergers this year, industry analysts and dealmakers said.  Investors are now also expecting major media consolidation, with Twenty-First Century Fox Inc shares rising more than 6 percent in after-market trading. Cable network owner Discovery Inc saw shares increase 3.2 percent while mobile providers, Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.O, which are waiting for a government approval of their own, also saw a bump following the decision.  AT&T said that controlling Time Warner\u2019s cable brands will help it craft new types of content to retain its customers as web-based rivals like Netflix Inc woo audiences away from traditional pay-TV subscriptions.  For cable companies feeling the pain of cord-cutting, similar deals for coveted media brands could help them build out new content offerings and offset expected declines in revenues, analysts and dealmakers told Reuters.  The Justice Department had argued that AT&T\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner would allow it to charge premium prices to rivals who relied on its Turner and HBO channels to woo customers to their cable plans, potentially giving it an unfair advantage in the pay-TV market. Now this will be a less of a concern for companies.  \u201cThis decision could serve as a \u2018green light\u2019 for other potential M&A, including Comcast\u2019s ongoing pursuit of FOX,\u201d said John Hodulik, an analyst at UBS, in a note.  Regulators will still likely scrutinize similar deals, and there is no guarantee that the district court\u2019s approval of AT&T\u2019s merger with Time Warner means that other major media acquisitions would be approved, several antitrust attorneys told Reuters.  Still, at least one company, Comcast, the largest U.S. cable provider, had been waiting for the court decision before making any large M&A moves in media, sources have said.  Rival cable company Comcast is now likely to go ahead with its planned attempt to woo Fox away from Walt Disney Co, which said it would acquire most assets of the media company for around $50 billion last year.  \u201cRegardless of what happens on the appeal front, expect Comcast to put forth an all-cash bid in the next day or so at a premium to Disney,\u201d said Mary Ann Halford, senior adviser to OC&C Strategy Consultants.  Comcast is aiming to gain control over Fox assets such as its Twentieth Century Fox Film and TV studios, which includes brands ranging from X-Men to The Simpsons, as well many of its cable networks.  The court ruling could also open the door for Verizon, AT&T\u2019S main rival, to bid for a media company, UBS\u2019 Hodulik added.  However, in Verizon\u2019s most recent quarterly earnings call, executives said they would rather sit out the current consolidation, and instead build out its content offerings through partnerships with independent media companies.  It also appointed a new chief executive officer earlier this month, Hans Vestberg, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, in a move that signaled Verizon would likely double down on its existing telecommunications business.  Still, one potential target for Verizon would be a combined CBS Corp and Viacom Inc, analysts have said, assuming that on ongoing legal battle between CBS\u2019s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, and the company\u2019s board, is resolved.  In a recent court filing, Redstone said her long-term plan was to create a combined company, which would unite media assets including CBS\u2019 broadcast networks, Showtime, MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, and then sell it.  Halford, from OC&C added, \u201cAll I know is that this will be a blockbuster summer for media mergers!\u201d","3":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other powerful business groups asked an appeals court on Thursday to not undo AT&T Inc's T.N purchase of movie and TV show maker Time Warner, despite the protests of the Justice Department.  The chamber, backed by the National Association of Manufacturers, Business Roundtable and others, argued that stopping the merger would \u201cundermine myriad transactions that generally benefit consumers.\u201d  The business groups argued that companies had long assumed that if they bought a supplier or distributor -- generally called a vertical merger -- that the deal would be considered good for the consumer and would be allowed.  \u201cThe vague legal standard that the government ... advocate(s) would cloud the business community\u2019s ability to ascertain whether vertical mergers are lawful, making it more difficult to invest in transactions with enormous potential to lower prices and enhance innovation\u2014all of which benefit a diverse array of customers,\u201d the business groups said in a brief court filing.  The Justice Department lost a lawsuit in district court to prevent AT&T, which owns satellite company DirecTV, from buying Time Warner over concerns that AT&T would seek to raise prices when licensing Time Warner\u2019s news, sports and other programing to DirecTV\u2019s cable and satellite rivals.  AT&T closed the Time Warner deal in June and has said it would manage Time Warner\u2019s Turner cable television networks as part of a separate business unit until February 2019 or the conclusion of the government\u2019s appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.  No date has been set for an oral argument.  The merger, announced in October 2016, was opposed by President Donald Trump. The merged company includes CNN, a frequent target of Trump\u2019s ire.  A group of nine state attorneys general asked the court on Wednesday also to let the lower court stand.","4":"FILE PHOTO - An AT&T logo is pictured in Pasadena, California, U.S., January 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. District Judge Richard Leon said on Thursday a trial to decide if AT&T's T.N $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc TWX.N is legal under U.S. antitrust law may last six to eight weeks, significantly longer than previously forecast.  At a pre-trial hearing, Leon said he will hear up to two days of motions before hearing opening arguments on Wednesday.  Lawyers for the government and both companies did not comment on Leon\u2019s estimate on the length of the trial; they had previously suggested it would last three weeks.  The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit in November to stop AT&T, which owns DirecTV and other products with 25 million subscribers, from buying movie and TV show maker Time Warner, which owns HBO and CNN, among many other channels, saying it could raise prices for rivals and pay-TV subscribers while hampering the development of online video.  The judge will hear arguments on a number of objections including whether some emails can be introduced as evidence and how to handle potentially confidential information during the trial.  Shares of AT&T closed nearly unchanged at $37.04, while Time Warner closed up 0.5 percent to $96.88.  Leon warned reporters not to use electronic devices and said they could be banned from the courtroom and held in contempt of court if they violated the prohibition.  He also discouraged the government and companies from attempting to try the case in the press, saying his goal was to ensure both sides receive a fair trial. \u201cThe case will be tried in this room,\u201d Leon said.  After the hearing, Leon told both sides to \u201cGet your rest\u201d before the start of a lengthy trial.","5":"(Reuters) - AT&T Inc's WarnerMedia has expanded its partnership with Alphabet Inc's Youtube TV to feature its upcoming streaming service HBOMax, as well as content from HBO and Cinemax, the companies said bit.ly\/38LpRnE on Thursday.  Youtube TV already had access to Turner Classic Movies and Cartoon Network, among other WarnerMedia channels, under the previous deal.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Under the deal, Microsoft and AT&T will also work together on so-called edge computing, which will see Microsoft technology deployed alongside AT&T\u2019s coming 5G network for applications that need extremely small delays in passing data back and forth, such as air traffic control systems for drones. The multi-year deal is worth more than $2 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The agreement is a major win for Microsoft, which will become AT&T\u2019s \u201cpreferred\u201d cloud vendor and is fighting to gain market share from Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Amazon Web Services, the biggest provider of public cloud services. Cloud service customers run their software applications in data centers managed by the cloud provider.  AT&T will remain responsible for its own core networking operations for cell phones and other devices. But John Donovan, chief executive of AT&T Communications, told Reuters the deal is a fundamental shift for the telecommunications provider to become \u201cpublic cloud first,\u201d meaning that it will predominately rely on data centers built by others to power the rest of its business.  \u201cThis is one of the most far-reaching initiatives we have put together because of it being so comprehensive,\u201d he said.  For Microsoft\u2019s part, the company will also gain a partner to sell its edge computing services, which will help software developers write programs for situations like factories whose machines are fitted with sensors to collect data or retail stores fitted with sensors and cameras to help keep inventories up to date.  \u201cOur general heritage of being a developer tools company, combined with the network capabilities of AT&T, is unique,\u201d Microsoft Chief Executive Sayta Nadella told Reuters.  The deal between Microsoft and AT&T came a day after AT&T said that its AT&T Business Solutions unit will tap International Business Machines Corp to help modernize its software for the cloud and move it back and forth across data centers. An IBM spokesman confirmed that the deal is worth billions of dollars over several years but did not provide a precise figure. The Financial Times earlier reported the IBM deal value.  Ed Anderson, an analyst with research firm Gartner, said too little is known yet to say how important the 5G and edge computing aspects of the deal will be.  \u201cIn addition to (AT&T) being an important customer, you\u2019ve got two big important technology companies starting to come together to think about what some other possibilities are,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cBut at this point, it\u2019s really kind of left to the imagination to kind of figure out what those possibilities are.\u201d","7":"The Verizon store in Superior, Colorado, U.S., July 27, 2017.

The sale of AT&T\u2019s 9.5 percent stake to Hulu in a cash deal gives Walt Disney Co, which holds a 60 percent stake in Hulu via a joint venture, more control of the company.  Comcast Corp\u2019s NBCUniversal has a 30 percent stake in Hulu. Based on the joint venture agreement, Disney and Comcast will decide how they want to allocate the shares bought from AT&T.  Hulu, which competes with Netflix Inc and Amazon.com\u2019s Prime Video, has more than 25 million subscribers and is expected to lose $1.5 billion in the current fiscal year.  Hulu\u2019s total value has risen from a reported $5.8 billion in 2016, when Time Warner - now a part of AT&T - bought the stake. Netflix at the time had a market capitalization of about $41 billion. Based on Monday\u2019s stock market closing price, Netflix is valued at $152 billion.  AT&T, which is preparing to launch its own subscription streaming video service later this year, said that its unit WarnerMedia would continue to work with Hulu to deliver content over the platform. It did not give further details.  \u201cWarnerMedia will remain a valued partner to Hulu for years to come as we offer customers the best of TV, live and on demand, all in one place,\u201d Hulu Chief Executive Officer Randy Freer said in a statement.  AT&T said it would use the proceeds here from the deal to reduce debt, which stood at $176.5 billion at the end of 2018.  The company had said in November it could consider selling its stake in Hulu and review its non-core assets in 2019.  The transaction did not require any governmental or other third-party approvals and was simultaneously signed and closed, Hulu and AT&T said.  Disney last week forecast Hulu\u2019s subscribers to reach 40 million to 60 million by fiscal 2024 and for the company to become profitable in the United States by 2023 or 2024.","14":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday it would appeal a federal judge's approval of AT&T Inc's T.N $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner, raising the prospect barely a month after the deal closed that it could be undone.  AT&T was sued by the Justice Department on antitrust grounds, saying that the deal would harm consumers, but U.S. District Judge Richard Leon last month approved the deal, allowing it to move forward following a lengthy trial. The merger, first announced in October 2016, was also opposed by President Donald Trump.  Leon ruled that the tie-up between AT&T\u2019s wireless and satellite businesses with Time Warner\u2019s movies and television shows was legal under antitrust law.  AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson told reporters on Thursday at a conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, that the company was not surprised about the Justice Department\u2019s decision to appeal.  \u201cThey have the right to appeal. Everyone has the right to appeal. We have a very fact-based thoughtful order. It will be evaluated on those grounds,\u201d he said.  A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.  The Justice Department opted in June not to seek an immediate stay of the court\u2019s approval of the merger, allowing the deal to close on June 14. The Justice Department still had 60 days, however, to appeal the decision approving the merger.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The government\u2019s notice of appeal filed in U.S. District Court in Washington did not disclose on what grounds it intends to challenge the approval.  Michael Carrier, an antitrust expert at Rutgers University, said the Justice Department could challenge Leon\u2019s analysis of the facts of the case, the economic arguments given or what Carrier described as an apparent pro-defendant approach by the judge.  Leon had sharply urged the Justice Department not to seek a stay of his ruling, saying it would be \u201cmanifestly unjust\u201d to do so and not likely to succeed. In his ruling, he said the government had failed to show competitive harm.  AT&T told the Justice Department in a June 14 letter that it would manage Time Warner\u2019s Turner cable television networks as part of a separate business unit and take other steps until February 2019 or until any government appeal.  AT&T also said that in the short term, it would have no role in setting Turner prices and the number of Turner employees and target compensation and benefits would remain \u201clargely unchanged.\u201d AT&T also said it would implement a firewall between Turner and AT&T to prevent the exchange of sensitive information of unaffiliated programmers or distributors.  In 2016, the Justice Department had demanded that AT&T sell the Turner networks, which include CNN, as part of approving the merger.  John Bergmayer, senior counsel at advocacy group Public Knowledge, said that since the deal was approved, AT&T had raised prices for some video and wireless services.  \u201cThe AT&T-Time Warner transaction is a bad deal for consumers and competition,\u201d he said. \u201cJudge Leon\u2019s decision contained numerous errors, and we believe the DOJ\u2019s position should be vindicated.\u201d  Deals approved by a federal judge have been undone on appeal in the past.  In 2001, H.J. Heinz Co called off its acquisition of Beech-Nut after an appeals court overturned a lower court\u2019s decision to allow the merger. The Federal Trade Commission had argued the deal would have merged the No. 2 and No. 3 baby food makers and that competition would be \u201clessened substantially\u201d if it were to go forward.","15":"(Reuters) - AT&T Inc's T.N advertising unit Xandr has purchased clypd, an advertising platform that uses data to better target television ads, a source familiar with the matter said, as Xandr seeks to make TV commercials as personally targeted as internet ads.  Clypd, which counts TV networks Discovery DISCA.O and CBS CBS.N as partners, uses data to enable advertisers to target viewers more precisely by their interests. TV commercials are traditionally purchased with only the capability to target people by age and gender.  The purchase amount could not be learned. A Xandr spokesman declined to comment. Clypd did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The deal will also add linear TV ad inventory, or ad space, from clypd\u2019s clients to Xandr Community, a product that pools advertising space from AT&T-owned properties that include WarnerMedia and DirecTV, but also third parties like cable networks A+E and AMC, the source said.  The addition helps resolve a concern from some advertising buyers that Community did not offer access to enough valuable linear TV, which still reaches a larger audience than streaming services.  The deal comes as AT&T is fending off activist investor Elliott Management, which has questioned its $85 billion purchase of Time Warner. It has also called for AT&T to consider selling satellite TV provider DirecTV, which has been losing subscribers.  AT&T has resisted suggestions such as getting rid of DirecTV because that would undercut its master plan to create a powerful advanced advertising machine by stitching together wireless, satellite TV and content operations.  The plan would allow advertisers to reach the right viewers and more effectively measure their ads.  Clypd is the second deal under Xandr Chief Executive Brian Lesser, who previously led ad agency GroupM in North America, to build Xandr\u2019s ad tech capabilities. It bought AppNexus, a digital advertising tech platform, last year for a reported $1.6 billion.","16":"LOS ANGELES, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Superhero movie \u201cWonder Woman 1984\u201d will debut in theaters and on AT&T Inc\u2019s HBO Max streaming service on Christmas Day, The Hollywood Reporter and other media outlets reported on Wednesday.

The move comes just one month after the U.S. wireless carrier announced it would resume buying advertising on YouTube, after a nearly two-year boycott of the platform. The previous boycott was also due to concerns that its ads could run on videos featuring hate speech or other disturbing material.  The report by Wired magazine that commercials had run alongside offensive videos and comments also prompted food and beverage maker Nestle SA to pause advertising on YouTube earlier this week.  YouTube said it had removed some of the content, which violated its policies against child endangerment, nudity and other behavior it considers inappropriate. YouTube added that it disabled comments on tens of millions of videos that include minors.  \u201cThere\u2019s more to be done, and we continue to work to improve and catch abuse more quickly,\u201d YouTube said in a statement.

About 2.5 million of Dish\u2019s 13 million customers subscribe to HBO or Cinemax, according to one person familiar with the matter. AT&T also owns DirecTV, a satellite TV rival to Dish.

The dispute could be a public relations blow to AT&T, which is heading back into court in December when oral arguments begin in the DOJ\u2019s appeal of the antitrust decision approving the No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier\u2019s $85 billion deal to buy Time Warner.  \u201cThis behavior, unfortunately, is consistent with what the Department of Justice predicted would result from the merger,\u201d a DOJ representative said. \u201cWe are hopeful the Court of Appeals will correct the errors of the District Court.\u201d  The Justice Department\u2019s statement was amplified by Fox Business Network journalist Charlie Gasparino\u2019s tweet on the matter.  AT&T fired back: \u201cThe Department of Justice collaborated closely with Dish in its unsuccessful lawsuit to block our merger,\u201d a WarnerMedia spokesman said in a statement. \u201cThat collaboration continues to this day with Dish\u2019s tactical decision to drop HBO \u2013 not the other way around.

The document here submitted to the AT&T board did not explicitly describe a layoff plan but did call for \"outsourcing of non-core network functions\" as well as \"closing redundant stores and increasing labor productivity.\"  Trump, a frequent critic of U.S. cable news channel CNN, which is owned by AT&T, at the time said it was \u201cgreat news that an activist investor is now involved with AT&T.\u201d The White House on Thursday did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Trump in June urged AT&T customers to drop the telecommunications company over its ownership of CNN.  The Communications Workers of America, which represents over 100,000 AT&T workers, has called on the company to reject Elliott\u2019s proposals, which it said would lead to job cuts.  AT&T is under pressure to cut its huge debt pile. The company said on Wednesday it would sell its wireless and wireline operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to Liberty Latin America Ltd LILA.O for $1.95 billion.","30":"WASHINGTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Fans will be glued to the \u201cMarch Madness\u201d college basketball tournament as the joint owner of rights for the games, Time Warner Inc, goes before a judge on Thursday to defend a proposed takeover by AT&T Inc .  With some 12 million viewers per game last year, the NCAA tournament exemplifies the marquee programming the U.S. government argues will become more expensive if Time Warner is bought by AT&T, the biggest pay-TV provider via subsidiary DirecTV.  The Justice Department filed a lawsuit in November to stop AT&T, which has some 25 million pay-TV subscribers, from closing the $85 billion deal. AT&T says a merger benefits consumers by creating efficiencies.  If the government loses, that could open up the field for similar tie-ups between distributors and content providers. But a win could strengthen the hand of antitrust regulators looking at other, similarly structured mergers.  Opening arguments in the case are set for Thursday before Judge Richard Leon in Washington, who will decide the case. They were delayed one day by bad weather.  The merger would hand AT&T, if it becomes the new owner of Time Warner, the motive and opportunity to refuse to license the March Madness games, along with premium cable channel HBO and other content, to pay-TV rivals and online distributors, the Justice Department says.  The case is unusual for several reasons. To begin with, President Donald Trump criticized the proposed deal during his campaign and since taking office.  AT&T lawyer Daniel Petrocelli had asked for access to communications between the White House and Justice Department about the deal, but Judge Leon denied the request.  AT&T and Time Warner also are not direct competitors, making the deal a so-called vertical merger between companies on the same supply chain. The vast majority of challenged mergers involve one rival buying another.  If the government loses, Verizon Communications Inc and Charter Communications Inc could strike deals to buy movie or television makers and squeeze smaller pay-TV providers.  \u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone is big enough to swallow up Netflix but you know they want to,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, president of the advocacy group Public Knowledge.  AT&T has said the merger would result in more than $2.5 billion in annual cost savings by 2020. It also plans to argue the deal is crucial to compete with companies like Facebook Inc , Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Netflix Inc.  The internet companies pose two challenges to pay TV. They either compete with cable and satellite television for ad dollars or provide cheaper online video that has hurt pricey pay-TV. Some do both.  Consumers could be hurt if AT&T is reluctant to sell Time Warner content to online distributors in order to protect pay-TV at a time of declining subscriptions, Kimmelman said.  \u201cWhile everyone is very worried about the big tech giants for good reason, this isn\u2019t one of the concerns that makes any sense,\u201d he said, adding that he welcomed moves by Google and Amazon into video.  Apple, Facebook and other vertically integrated tech companies are more powerful than media companies were 50 years ago because they own consumer data they can use to target advertising and predict future purchases, said Andrea Murino, an antitrust lawyer with Goodwin Procter LLP.  This, combined with antitrust enforcers\u2019 preference for asset sales to resolve competitive concerns, could mean that more vertical deals will be challenged in court, she said.

REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni  The second-largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers said at an analyst meeting in New York that it will pay down $18 billion to $20 billion of its debt by the end of 2019, and will generate up to $8 billion in cash in part through the sale of some assets.  Shares of AT&T, which rose 1 percent in after hours trade during the presentation, are down 21 percent so far this year as investors have been concerned about its heavy debt - which totaled $183 billion as of Sept. 30 - after its purchase of media company Time Warner.  The company said it expects 2019 free-cash flow of about $26 billion, above analysts\u2019 average estimate of $24.84 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  AT&T said the growth in free cash flow will help achieve its end-of-year net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times range.  AT&T expects 2019 adjusted earnings per share to grow in low single digits, while analysts are expecting a 1.7 percent rise.  The company also gave fresh details about a new streaming rival to Netflix that is expected to be launched by the end of 2019 by WarnerMedia, the new segment that includes the Turner networks and premium channel HBO.  The new product will include three tiers of service: an entry-level package focused on movies, a premium tier with original programming and the highest tier will include licensed content from other providers.  AT&T said it hopes to eventually lure enough subscribers to make up for the continuous decline in linear video customers from its satellite TV company DirecTV. The company said it expects a decline in video subscribers in 2019 consistent with the pace of decrease in the third quarter of 2018.  AT&T lost more satellite TV customers than Wall Street expected in the third quarter, shedding a net 359,000 subscribers, as viewers move to services like Netflix NFLX.O and Hulu.","32":"April 20 (Reuters) -  * U.S. SAID TO INVESTIGATE AT&T AND VERIZON OVER WIRELESS COLLUSION CLAIM - NYT, CITING SOURCES Source text: nyti.ms\/2HhCE3c Further company coverage:","33":"NEW YORK\/LONDON\/HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Corona Capital is a column updated throughout the day by Breakingviews columnists around the world with short, sharp pandemic-related insights.

The decline in U.S. advertising spending this year will likely be not as bad as originally feared. A new forecast from GroupM, the media arm of ad giant WPP, believes advertising will fall 9% to about $215 billion rather than the 13% predicted in June. Throw in political campaigns and the picture looks even better with a decline of 4%. The pandemic has pushed small businesses to advertise online who otherwise might not have \u2013 presumably because real-world customers are harder to come by.  The recovery though will be K-shaped \u2013 one part going up while another goes down. Digital advertising is expected to rise 5% partly on the strong third-quarter performances of Alphabet\u2019s Google, Facebook and Amazon.com, and could next year represent 55% of all ad spending. The outlook is grim for print, though: a 20% decline for magazines and a 30% drop for newspapers. Combined, they\u2019re unlikely to top $10 billion in ad spend, versus a peak of more than $90 billion more than a decade ago. With regulators already concerned about the dominance of technology firms, these figures could strengthen their hand. (By Jennifer Saba)  GHOST RIDER. Brooks Running, the Berkshire Hathaway-owned sports shoe and apparel company, could see its 2020 revenue jump 27% versus 2019, with $1 billion in sales possible next year. While runners weren\u2019t able to compete in races like the Boston Marathon this year, the company gained 1.6 million new runners, chief executive Jim Weber highlighted this week. Free time and closed gyms may have pushed many stir-crazy people to lace up.  Like many Warren Buffett-approved firms, Brooks has brand power. In a 2020 Running USA survey, it was voted the top running shoe brand by a wide margin. That may be why the Seattle-based company posted an almost 50% year-over-year sales spike in the third quarter, while revenue at Adidas and Asics dropped. These firms also aren\u2019t pure plays on running. Brooks may not be able to keep up this rapid pace, but pent-up demand for racing next year suggests it could still hit a PR.

Covid-19 has slowed economic activity and energy consumption, but the planet might still be worse off when it comes to carbon emissions. According to a report released by the International Energy Agency on Thursday, global investments in energy-efficient buildings, equipment and vehicles, vital to achieving long-term sustainable development goals, could contract by almost 10% this year.  Policymakers are trying to reverse that trend. From South Korea to the United Kingdom and the United States, they are planning a greener economy to support recovery. As of September, about 30% of the $12 trillion in fiscal stimulus announced targets sectors that impact the environment, estimates the World Resources Institute. That\u2019s laudable, but it may not be enough to fill the gap: transitioning to a low-carbon economy will require at least $3 trillion to $5 trillion a year over the next three decades, according to the Global Financial Markets Association and Boston Consulting.

FILE PHOTO: Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes arrives ahead of arguments in the trial to determine if AT&T's merger with Time Warner is legal under antitrust law at U.S. District Court in Washington, U.S., March 22, 2018. REUTERS\/Aaron P. Bernstein  Bewkes told Judge Richard Leon, who will decide if the $84.5 billion deal may go forward, that the U.S. Justice Department was wrong to say that AT&T would be reluctant to license Time Warner\u2019s TV and movie content to rivals, causing blackouts, in order to win over new customers to AT&T subsidiary DirecTV.  \u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said Bewkes, who has been CEO for more than 10 years. \u201cIf our channels are not in distribution we lose lots of money (from lost subscriptions and advertising).\u201d  He said that \u201cone percent, less than one percent, maybe two percent\u201d of subscribers would drop their pay TV subscription because of a blackout, far below the 12 percent estimated by an economist for the government who testified earlier in the trial.  Bewkes argued it was in Time Warner\u2019s best interest financially to license its television channels, which range from movies to CNN to sports, broadly online.  He said Time Warner had been hampered in innovating and advertising because it does not have the granular information about viewers held by pay TV and internet companies.  With digital advertising, Chevrolet, for example, can target car ads at people looking to actually buy a car, he said.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  AT&T has said a key benefit of owning Time Warner is that it can take data about its 141 million U.S. wireless subscribers and 25 million video subscribers and marry it with Time Warner\u2019s programming to enable advertisers to target TV ads.  Targeted TV ads, also known as addressable TV, have yet to go mainstream because they involve renegotiating carriage deals with programmers and distributors, said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research.  Targeted TV could represent more than $100 billion in revenue by 2030 for companies that offer it, according to an April Credit Suisse report, which called it \u201ca largely overlooked benefit of the AT&T\/Time Warner transaction.\u201d The ads can be sold at triple the price of regular ads.  \u201cThe Google\/Facebook duopoly has such a strong hold on the market, I think it\u2019s important that there is healthy competition and that we aren\u2019t just forced to invest in two places,\u201d said Tim Villanueva, head of media strategy for Fetch, an ad agency focused on mobile, whose clients include eBay and Lululemon. He said he was interested in using the new platform.  Advertisers\u2019 spending on TV ads in 2018 is expected to be around $70 billion, a 1.45 percent increase from three years ago, according to research firm eMarketer.  ALREADY INNOVATING?  In cross examination, Justice Department lawyer Claude Scott pointed to efforts that Time Warner was already making to move into targeted advertising and online distribution, including contracting with tech companies, an apparent attempt to call into question the need for the megamerger.  Scott referred to Bewkes\u2019 compensation package, noting that he would be leaving the company when the deal closed and that he owned more than 2 million Time Warner shares. AT&T\u2019s deal for Time Warner is about a 35 percent premium over the market price.  The trial has seen a parade of witnesses testifying about how the merger would affect them. Executives from smaller pay TV companies talked about how important it was to have access to Time Warner\u2019s movies and television shows.  The trial, which began in mid-March in U.S. District Court in Washington, is expected to wrap up this month.","35":"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday said PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP must pay $625.3 million in damages to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp for failing to uncover fraud that led to one of the largest bank failures of the global financial crisis.  U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein found it more likely than not that PwC\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of FDIC damages from the August 2009 demise of Montgomery, Alabama\u2019s Colonial BancGroup Inc, once among the 25 largest U.S. banks.  Rothstein said PwC failed to uncover a multi-year fraud between Colonial, its former client, and Ocala, Florida-based Taylor, Bean & Whitaker, once the nation\u2019s 12th largest mortgage lender and a major Colonial customer.  The FDIC sued in its role as receiver for Colonial Bank, which once had more than $25 billion of assets and 340 branches.  Taylor Bean also failed in August 2009. Its former chairman, Lee Farkas, is serving a 30-year prison term for his 2011 conviction on fraud and conspiracy charges.  Rothstein had found PwC liable for negligence in December, after a non-jury trial, and tried the damages issue in March, also without a jury.  PwC had argued that the FDIC could recover $306.7 million at most, and that no damages were justified because numerous Colonial employees had interfered with its audits.  \u201cWe intend to pursue an appeal of this matter at the earliest opportunity,\u201d its outside lawyer Phil Beck said in a statement provided by PwC.  The FDIC said it does not discuss pending litigation. It previously settled with Colonial\u2019s internal auditor, Crowe Horwath.  On Feb. 28, Taylor Bean\u2019s former auditor Deloitte & Touche LLP [DLTE.UL] agreed to pay $149.5 million to settle U.S. government claims it also missed the fraud.  According to the FDIC, the fraud began in 2002 when Taylor Bean began overdrawing its accounts and Colonial, at Farkas\u2019 urging, began manipulating those accounts to conceal it.  This allegedly included the sale by Taylor Bean to Colonial of mortgages that had already been sold to other investors, and Colonial receiving stakes in mortgages that had no collateral or were in default.  By the time the fraud was discovered, Colonial\u2019s balance sheet included $1.47 billion of mortgage trades that were \u201cfake or otherwise impaired,\u201d Rothstein wrote.  The $625.3 million award covers PwC\u2019s audits of Colonial from 2003 to 2005 and in 2008.  A trial for the 2006 and 2007 audits has not been scheduled because the FDIC did not waive its right to a jury trial.

We don\u2019t dispute that. But AT&T wants to turn that into a get-out-jail-free card for their illegal merger.\u201d  AT&T and Time Warner\u2019s lawyer Daniel Petrocelli, however, cited Trump\u2019s repeated criticism of the deal as reason to allow the company to argue that the government opposed the deal for political reasons. It is seeking records of communications between the White House and Justice Department that describe Trump\u2019s views on the merger.  AT&T wants the judge to review any communications found to see if they bolster their contention that the transaction was singled out because of Trump\u2019s anger with CNN.  The documents were requested as preparation for a March 19 trial in which Judge Richard Leon will decide if the $85 billion deal would raise prices. The Justice Department sued to stop the deal on the grounds that it is illegal under antitrust law.  The government has asked Judge Leon to rule that AT&T may not cite politics, formally known as selective enforcement, as a defense and to quash a request for documents to support that defense.  AT&T\u2019s Petrocelli defended the request. \u201cIf there is something in those documents, it\u2019s important for us,\u201d he said at the hearing at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  Leon said he would rule on Tuesday.  The deal has been followed more closely than most antitrust matters because Trump attacked it while on the campaign trail in 2016. Trump has also repeatedly criticized Time Warner\u2019s CNN news network and, in November, he reiterated his opposition to the proposed transaction.  Conrath said the government\u2019s lawsuit was not motivated by Trump\u2019s irritation with CNN and said it had offered several settlement options that would have allowed AT&T to acquire CNN.  As recently as November, Trump stood by his criticism of the proposed transaction.  \u201cPersonally I\u2019ve always felt that that was a deal that\u2019s not a good deal for the country,\u201d the president said. \u201cI think your pricing\u2019s going to go up, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good deal for the country.\u201d  Conrath warned that if the Justice Department were forced to conduct a much broader search for additional documents it could delay the trial until July. Leon also said he did not want the case to get \u201csidetracked.\u201d  \u201cWe have no intention of losing this schedule,\u201d Petrocelli said.  Petrocelli said Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes had laid out in extensive detail the company\u2019s belief that Trump\u2019s improper influence was a factor in a deposition Thursday.  AT&T had taken the unusual step of including the assistant attorney general for antitrust, Makan Delrahim, on its witness list as it looks to find evidence to support its position that the government was bringing a case because of Trump\u2019s anger.  Conrath offered an affidavit from Delrahim in which he said he had not been instructed or ordered by anyone at the White House or at the Justice Department to bring the lawsuit.  Merger cases, however, are judged illegal or legal depending on whether prices go up or innovation is lost because of the deal.  Petrocelli derided the government\u2019s case as \u201cweak,\u201d saying that their economists had determined the price of AT&T\u2019s DirecTV could go down and that there could be a small increase to non-DirecTV consumers.

U.S. District Judge Richard Leon found little to support the government\u2019s arguments that the deal would harm consumers, calling one position \u201cgossamer thin\u201d and another \u201cpoppycock.\u201d  The ruling could also prompt a cascade of pay TV companies buying television and movie makers, with Comcast Corp\u2019s bid for some Twenty-First Century Fox Inc assets potentially the first out of the gate.  The merger, including debt, would be the fourth largest deal ever attempted in the global telecom, media and entertainment space, according to Thomson Reuters data. It would also be the 12th largest deal in any sector, the data showed.  In a scathing opinion bit.ly\/2Jxx6qE, Leon concluded that the government had failed to show competitive harm and urged the U.S. government not to seek a stay of his ruling pending a potential appeal, saying it would be \"manifestly unjust\" to do so and not likely to succeed.  \u201cThat\u2019s a legal shocker,\u201d said J.B. Heaton, an attorney and consultant on litigation and regulatory proceedings. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see now that companies will be much more confident about vertical mergers,\u201d he added, referring to deals where a company merges with a supplier.  Shares of AT&T fell about 1.3 percent in after-hours trade following the decision, while Time Warner rose more than 5 percent.  Twenty-First Century Fox jumped 7 percent in extended trade after the ruling on expectations that Comcast and Walt Disney Co could start a bidding war to acquire its media assets. Comcast and Walt Disney dropped 4.3 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively.  Shares of other media and telecom companies also rose, including T-Mobile US Inc, Sprint Corp, CBS Corp, Dish Network Corp, Discovery Inc and Viacom Inc.  \u201cThis will be a blockbuster summer for media mergers,\u201d said Mary Ann Halford, senior adviser to OC&C Strategy Consultants.  Shares of Express Scripts Holding Co, which is set to be bought by Cigna Corp for $52 billion, rose 4.8 percent, while shares of health insurer Aetna Inc, due to be acquired by CVS Health Corp for $69 billion, rose 3.6 percent.  Opponents of the AT&T decision also predicted more deals.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  \u201cConsumers should fear a cascade of unchecked mergers and acquisitions to further consolidate the telecom industry resulting in less choice, fewer competitors and higher prices,\u201d Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said in a statement.  The Justice Department filed a lawsuit to stop the deal in November 2017, saying that AT&T\u2019s ownership of both DirecTV and Time Warner would give AT&T unfair leverage against rival cable providers that relied on Time Warner\u2019s content, such as CNN and HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d  Leaving the courtroom, Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice department\u2019s antitrust division, said that he would read the judge\u2019s opinion before making a decision on an appeal.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  The Justice Department is not likely to be put off by the loss, said Amy Ray of the law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, noting it had prevailed in stopping other mergers between rivals.  \u201cPut me on the side of the fence of thinking that AAG (Makan) Delrahim is interested in challenging the next problematic vertical transaction,\u201d she said.  Cornell law professor George Hay added that the ruling found the government\u2019s evidence lacking, rather than a broader determination of how vertical mergers affected competition.  AT&T in a six-week trial argued that the purchase of Time Warner would allow it to gain information about viewers needed to target digital advertising, much like Facebook Inc and Google already do.  AT&T can use the content from Time Warner to fill its streaming services DirecTV Now and soon-to-be-launched AT&T Watch, which are cheaper online video packages with fewer channels. That could give it a leg up over rival live streaming platforms that do not own content, media analysts have said.  AT&T applauded the court\u2019s decision and said it expected to close the merger before the June 21 contractual deadline.  The government estimated costs to industry rivals, such as Charter Communications Inc, would increase by $580 million a year if AT&T owned Time Warner.  Before the trial started, AT&T lawyers said the Time Warner deal may have been singled out for government enforcement but the judge rejected their bid to force the disclosure of White House communications that might have shed light on the matter.  The deal cost AT&T\u2019s top lobbyist, Bob Quinn, his job in May after it became public that AT&T had paid Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Michael Cohen $600,000 for advice on winning approval.  Burns McKinney, a portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors who owns AT&T, said he would not say the telecoms company had won a huge victory.  \u201cIt\u2019s more that they just didn\u2019t lose. You always wonder in these cases if there\u2019s a winner\u2019s curse, given the risk (AT&T) can\u2019t get the desired synergies and they\u2019re taking on a lot of debt with the merger,\u201d he said.","45":"May 16 (Reuters) - Voip-Pal.Com Inc :  * VOIP-PAL.COM - PATENT INFRINGEMENT LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY CO AGAINST TWITTER, VERIZON, AT&T AUTHORIZED BY U.S. DISTRICT COURT OF NEVADA TO MOVE FORWARD  * VOIP-PAL.COM -IN PROCESS OF ENGAGING EXPERT WITNESSES IN ORDER TO PREPARE DAMAGES ANALYSES FOR SUBMISSION TO DISTRICT COURT FOR THE INFRINGEMENT CASES.  * VOIP-PAL.COM INC - CO CONTINUES TO AWAIT PTAB\u2019S DECISION REGARDING APPLE\u2019S POST-JUDGMENT CHALLENGE TO VOIP-PAL\u2019S VICTORY IN IPR\u2019S FILED BY APPLE Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","46":"BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investors say telecommunications pioneer AT&T Inc will not take their calls for its upcoming annual meeting, reinforcing their concerns that the shift of the gathering to cyberspace due to the COVID-19 pandemic would restrict shareholder input.

The activists and several corporate governance specialists said it was the first time they knew of a company barring investors from introducing their resolutions in some manner.  AT&T spokesperson Daphne Avila disputed that the company is barring investors from participating. She said the company is asking proponents of shareholder resolutions - three in total - to provide written comments to be read by management during the meeting.  \u201cThis approach will let us efficiently address the matters to be voted and then move on to additional content, specifically the CEO\u2019s state of the business discussion and questions from shareholders,\u201d she said.

AT&T\u2019s event is one of the hundreds of U.S. corporate annual meetings shifted online in an effort to limit public gatherings that could spread the coronavirus.

One is John Chevedden, a prolific filer and backer of shareholder resolutions, including one this year calling on AT&T to have an independent board chair.  Like Rechenbach, Chevedden got an email from AT&T on Tuesday indicating he would not have a chance to speak. Chevedden said he has had difficulties at other online meetings this year, including at Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co GT.O, which cut him off as he spoke, and at Bank of New York Mellon Corp BK.N, which did not take his questions.  \u201cCompanies are trying to take advantage of COVID-19 and silence voices,\u201d Chevedden said.

The service will include everything from film classics like \u201cCasablanca\u201d to the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d and \u201cBatman\u201d franchises to TV series \u201cER\u201d and \u201cPretty Little Liars.\u201d  It is still in the planning phases and AT&T, the No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier, has not yet articulated how it will be structured or how it will be staffed.  The announcement of the service delivers on a promise AT&T made in June after shareholders approved the telecom company\u2019s $85 billion purchase of Time Warner in order to make more money selling products directly to consumers rather than just go through middlemen such as cable companies.  \u201cWhen we first discussed the benefits of combining WarnerMedia with AT&T, we saw the ability to create new consumer choices centered on unmatched options, value, quality, and experiences,\u201d John Stankey, WarnerMedia Chief Executive, wrote in the memo.  AT&T plans to finance the new service through \u201cincremental efficiencies\u201d at WarnerMedia, which includes consolidating resources from \u201csub-scale\u201d direct to consumer services, the company said in an SEC regulatory filing on Wednesday.  The company has also not yet set a price, but expects to bundle it with other services such as HBO and possibly newer services such as DC Universe.  The announcement answers a few questions about how it plans to take on rivals Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc which have created thriving businesses streaming movies and shows directly to consumers and Walt Disney Co. which is spending $71.3 billion on buying Twenty-First Century Fox to do the same.  Media conglomerates including AT&T and Disney have raced to catch up to Netflix which now serves more than 135 million subscribers globally and 58 million in the United States.  In an internal meeting over the summer that was leaked to the press, Stankey, an AT&T veteran, suggested a radical expansion of HBO, which rankled insiders fearful that its new owners would destroy a brand known for its high quality.  The launch of a new service that is expected to be bundled with but not exist as a division of HBO is seen helping to preserve HBO\u2019s reputation as a premium brand which has historically attracted Hollywood\u2019s hottest talent.  The new service will join other WarnerMedia direct to consumer businesses that include the recently launched DC Universe service for comic book and animated series fans and the FilmStruck classic movies service.","48":"(Reuters) - Two U.S. House Democrats on Thursday asked the White House and Justice Department to turn over documents that could show whether Republican President Donald Trump sought to intervene in the regulatory review of AT&T Inc\u2019s $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc.

AT&T lawyers said last year the deal may have been singled out for enforcement, citing as evidence statements by Trump as a candidate and as president that the deal was bad for consumers and the country.  Trump criticized the deal as a candidate in late 2016, saying it would concentrate too much media power in the hands of one owner, and later saying it would raise prices.

AT&T\u2019s second major court victory against the Justice Department sets the stage for the No. 2 wireless carrier to integrate its WarnerMedia business as well as its new Xandr advertising unit.  The deal had been a target of criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump, who opposed it because he saw it helping Time Warner\u2019s CNN unit, which he has accused of broadcasting \u201cfake news.\u201d  The three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled unanimously in favor of the deal. The decision could end a 15-month effort by the Justice Department to block the deal.  The judges said in their opinion the government\u2019s case was \u201cunpersuasive.\u201d  The Justice Department had asked the court to declare the deal illegal, arguing that AT&T, which owns DirecTV, would use ownership of Time Warner\u2019s content, such as CNN and HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d to make pay-TV rivals pay more, thus raising prices for consumers.  The deal was seen as a turning point for a media industry that has been upended by companies like Netflix Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google which produce content and sell it online directly to consumers without a cable subscription.  The case marked a rare instance of the U.S. government seeking to stop a merger of a distributor and a supplier.  The appeals court said it would give the Justice Department seven days to seek a rehearing or a review by the full appeals court before issuing the formal legal mandate.  AT&T said it hoped that this ruling would end the court fight. The Justice Department had no immediate comment.  AT&T shares were flat around midday.  The merger, which was announced in October 2016, closed on June 14 shortly after Judge Richard Leon ruled the deal was legal under antitrust law.  AT&T, the No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers, agreed to manage the Turner network separately until Feb. 28, 2019, or until the conclusion of any appeal by the Justice Department.  AT&T agreed it would have no role in setting Turner\u2019s prices to distributors and the number of Turner employees would remain largely unchanged.  The company also agreed to maintain a firewall between Turner and AT&T Communications to prevent the transmission of competitively sensitive information of unaffiliated programmers or distributors.  The appeals court took a shot at District Court Judge Leon, who had been scathing in his assessment of the government\u2019s attempt to stop the deal.  \u201cUndoubtedly the district court made some problematic statements, which the government identifies and this court cannot ignore,\u201d the panel said in its opinion.  Gigi Sohn, who worked in the Federal Communications Commission during the Obama administration, said that the ruling showed a need to reform antitrust laws so the government can stop problematic deals.  \u201cAT&T is favoring both Time Warner and DirecTV content over its broadband services through its DirecTV Now and Watch services,\u201d she said. \u201cConsumers are the losers.\u201d (Reporting by Diane Bartz and David Shepardson; additional reporting by Sheila Dang Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Meredith Mazzilli)","54":"WASHINGTON, March 20 (Reuters) - Opening statements in the trial to decide if AT&T Inc may buy Time Warner Inc were delayed by one day until Thursday because of forecasts of bad weather in Washington.

Shares of Viacom rose nearly 4 percent to $26.30 before the opening bell, while those of AT&T were marginally higher.  \u201cWe are pleased to announce a renewed Viacom-AT&T contract that includes continued carriage of Viacom services across multiple AT&T platforms and products,\u201d the companies said.  The initial deadline to reach a new contract was by midnight of March 22. The companies, however, continued to negotiate past the deadline.  Such conflicts have become increasingly common as media companies consolidate and viewers shift from traditional pay TV services to streaming services such as Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Prime Video.

Judges Judith W. Rogers, Robert L. Wilkins and David B. Sentelle will hear arguments on Dec. 6.  The government argues that AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion acquisition will lead to higher prices for consumers and was illegal under antitrust law, while AT&T says the government offered no basis for second guessing key conclusions of a lower-court ruling allowing the transaction to proceed.  Sentelle, a Reagan appointee, and Rogers, who was named to the bench by Clinton, were among seven appeals court judges in June 2001 that issued an opinion tossing out an order that Microsoft Corp should be broken up but found that the company possessed monopoly power and agreed that the company had behaved anticompetively.  The company ultimately agreed to a settlement with the Justice Department and an agreement to end retaliation against computer makers who use non-Microsoft software.  Wilkins, who joined the appeals court in 2014 as an Obama appointee, ruled on some antitrust matters as a judge on the U.S. District Court in Washington, including approving a consent decree that allowed Google, now known as Alphabet Inc, to acquire ITA Software in 2011.

Time Warner will be renamed WarnerMedia, according to a memo sent to employees by John Stankey, who will serve as CEO of WarnerMedia.  Turner CEO John Martin will leave the company, according to the memo, which was seen by Reuters.  Stephenson said on Friday AT&T intends to preserve Time Warner\u2019s creative culture, albeit under a new name.  He acknowledged differences in an email to AT&T and Time Warner employees late on Thursday, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.  \u201cAs different as our businesses are, I think you\u2019ll find we have a lot in common,\u201d wrote Stephenson. \u201cWe\u2019re big fans of your talent and creativity.

Some analysts have raised concerns about the high level of debt the company took on to acquire Time Warner, about $180 billion at the close of the merger, Stephenson said.

FILE PHOTO: An AT&T logo is seen at a AT&T building in New York City, October 23, 2016. REUTERS\/Stephanie Keith\/File Photo  STORY:  COMMENTS:  GEORGE HAY, CORNELL LAW SCHOOL, ITHACA, NEW YORK  \u201cThe opinion is not a radical one and it will be difficult to overturn on appeal.  \u201cIn ruling that the merger could go forward, the judge did not take the approach favored by some that a vertical transaction like this could never pose a competitive problem. Rather he took the straightforward position that the evidence did not support the assumptions on which the DOJ theory of competitive harm depended.  \u201cTherefore, he found that AT&T would be unlikely to find it profitable to withhold content from its distribution rivals and that any impact on the price of content would be negligible. The result is not a green light for all possible media mergers but will serve as a roadmap for the kinds of facts merging parties will have to assemble to make their case. And in that sense it will certainly prompt additional media mergers.  \u201cThe opinion does not take the DOJ completely out of the merger business but simply admonishes them to make sure the facts support their theory. Of course, the DOJ can seek to prevent the merger from going forward pending appeal though the judge discouraged them from doing so. Even if the merger is consummated, the DOJ can appeal the decision but it is uncertain whether they will.\u201d  JENNIFER FRITZSCHE, SENIOR ANALYST AT WELLS FARGO, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA:  \u201cThis ruling from Judge Leon represents the best case scenario for (AT&T & Time Warner), in our view. Not only was the deal approved, but the Judge did not impose any conditions on the merger, and went so far as to encourage DOJ not to file a stay pending appeal. We fully expect (AT&T) to close the acquisition on 6\/18 (the earliest point that it can), and look for a business update shortly thereafter.\u201d  JIM COX, DUKE UNIVERSITY LAW PROFESSOR, DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA:  \u201cI\u2019m not surprised about this. The government has not had a rich history in recent years... in these vertical acquisitions. There was a lot more focus 50 years ago on industry structure... Even the business community has been questioning whether AT&T is doing the right thing.  This was a hard road to hoe for the Department of Justice, and it was a case worth bringing, but unfortunately the precedents just weren\u2019t there. This is a judge who is very good and takes the law seriously, and he just didn\u2019t have the stepping stones to get to where the Department of Justice wanted him to go.\u201d  DAVID GLICKMAN, CEO, ULTRA MOBILE AND MINT MOBILE, CALIFORNIA:  \u201cI\u2019m not sure the judge or the Justice Department considered all the impacts this merger could have on smaller competitors,\u201d Glickman said, who said he tried to buy an advertisement on DirecTV, but was rejected because his company is a competitor of AT&T. \u201cAt the same time, if this decision helps T-Mobile and Sprint complete their merger, that\u2019s better for consumers.\u201d  BURNS MCKINNEY, PORTFOLIO MANAGER WHO OWNS AT&T, ALLIANZ GLOBAL INVESTORS, DALLAS:  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a huge victory for AT&T, it\u2019s more that they just didn\u2019t lose. You always wonder in these cases if there\u2019s a winner\u2019s curse, given the risk [AT&T] can\u2019t get the desired synergies and they\u2019re taking on a lot of debt with the merger.\u201d  GENE KIMMELMAN, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE, FORMER CHIEF COUNSEL FOR U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\u2019S ANTITRUST DIVISION, WASHINGTON:  \u201cThis is a very disappointing result. We\u2019re most concerned that this will open the floodgates to mergers among the largest and entertainment and transmission companies, further consolidating the power of dominant cable and satellite companies. The end result for consumers is that online video is unlikely to break the large bundles and high monthly charges that consumers have been oppressed with for decades. All video will effectively go through the portals of these dominant providers and Internet video will remain and add on to the high price of broadband and cable service.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s a very disappointing result for consumers. I think it also sends the wrong signal to the market place at a time when the public is increasingly worried about giant tech companies\u2019 growing dominance over the market place. This unfortunately sends the signal that those companies as well can continue to gobble up adjacent properties and grow their market power.\u201d  \u201cThis is all headed in the wrong direction for the goal of promoting more consumer choices, lower prices and greater innovation in the market place.\u201d  BRIAN WIESER, ANALYST, PIVOTAL RESEARCH GROUP, OREGON:  \u201cThis was much what we expected would happen almost two years ago that the deal would eventually go through. Obviously, it\u2019s not a done deal yet, it sounds like appeals are still possible. But, in terms of progressing toward the kind of outcome we always expected would occur, we are here.  Given what\u2019s evolved over the last year in particular, it does mean there will be more M&A to the extent that there were mergers or acquisitions which were held up because they wanted to see how this plays out so, I think Comcast has already indicated it will bid for Fox, that could have happened regardless of this ruling but, it almost certainly will now.  This trend toward consolidation among conglomerates has been persistent. If AT&T had lost, that might have caused less M&A, but this keeps open the realm of possibilities of combinations.\u201d  J.B. HEATON, ATTORNEY AND CONSULTANT ON LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, INDEPENDENT PRACTICE, CHICAGO:  \u201cIn 18 years of legal practice, I\u2019ve never heard a judge say you should not appeal. That\u2019s as close to him saying the government\u2019s case was frivolous. That\u2019s a legal shocker. I think we\u2019ll see now that companies will be much more confident about vertical mergers.\u201d  NILS TRACY, ANALYST, REORG RESEARCH INC, WASHINGTON D.C.:  \u201cThe ruling ... represents a major turning point in U.S. antitrust law, as it limits the power of the federal government to block vertical mergers purely out of a desire for structural rather than behavioral remedies. This policy point has been the cornerstone of antitrust policy under the Trump administration. The decision will make it more difficult for the DOJ and FTC to block vertical deals in the future, and will likely lead to a wave of vertical M&A in the near term. This decision bodes well for other vertical deals currently under review such as (Aetna Inc-CVS Health Corp) AET\/CVS, (Express Scripts Holding Co-Cigna Corp) ESRX\/CI, and Twenty-first Century Fox Inc-Walt Disney Co) FOX\/Disney.\u201d  ERIC SCHIFFER, CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM PATRIARCH, GREATER LOS ANGELES AREA:  \u201cYou are witnessing the single biggest day this century in the marriage of large media with giant distribution. Fox surges in interest because of this ruling with a voracious Comcast that won\u2019t want to back down. Verizon now will go into massive hunting mode and a CBS Verizon tie-up is a real possibility. The probabilities of a Sprint\/T-Mobile deal became powerfully more realistic.\u201d  BRETT SAPPINGTON, DIGITAL ENTERTAINMENT RESEARCH DIRECTOR, PARKS ASSOCIATES, DALLAS:  \u201cIf you\u2019re AT&T, who do you want to include in your own skinny bundle? The channels you own. This means if you\u2019re a small content network, you have less negotiating power, because the bundler owns its own content.\u201d  Sappington added that without conditions, AT&T doesn\u2019t have to guarantee anything other than its promise that it will play nice with other distributors and content providers.  \u201cThat\u2019s a big win for AT&T.\u201d  ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL MAKAN DELRAHIM, WASHINGTON:  \u201cWe are disappointed with the Court\u2019s decision today. We continue to believe that the pay-TV market will be less competitive and less innovative as a result of the proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner. We will closely review the Court\u2019s opinion and consider next steps in light of our commitment to preserving competition for the benefit of American consumers.\u201d  DANIEL IVES, CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER AND HEAD OF TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH, GBH INSIGHTS, GREATER NEW YORK:  \u201cWith Judge Leon ruling in favor of letting the landmark AT&T\/Time Warner $85 billion deal to go ahead as planned this afternoon despite DOJ anti-trust concerns, the impact from this decision will have wide reaching ramifications across the telecommunications, media, and tech industry for decades to come.\u201d  \u201cFor AT&T and Time Warner this is a \u2018major victory lap\u2019 as having these combined media and entertainment assets under the hood of AT&T will significantly enhance streaming endeavors and cross pollination going forward with a major shot across the bow toward other cable and wireless players as this telecommunications and media behemoth is now hitting the ground running.\u201d  \u201cIn particular we would expect aggressive bundling of HBO, CNN, and other proprietary sports content (NBA, NCAA, MLB) from Time Warner into the AT&T network as a key incentive for current and new AT&T wireless customers.\u201d  \u201cWith the AT&T ruling to move the deal forward, Comcast and Roberts will likely throw their hat in the ring in its quest to battle Iger and Disney for these unique entertainment assets that will propel the eventual winner to become a major streaming player and content rich behemoth for years to come.\u201d  JEFFREY LOGSDON, MANAGING DIRECTOR, JBL ADVISORS, CALIFORNIA:  \u201cFor AT&T, birth of vision in deal to buy TWX. Death of a vision when DOJ challenged prolonged the process. Fulfillment of a vision now that the court has approved the deal. The court is the last place you want to accomplish your M&A goal but in this case it was a sweet victory.\u201d  MARY ANN HALFORD, SENIOR ADVISOR, OC&C STRATEGY CONSULTANTS, NEW YORK:  \u201cI would expect that the government will file an appeal to prevent a June 18th closing. If that appeal is granted, then Time Warner will want compensation for extending the merger termination date. All that being said, I know that Time Warner management is keen to get this deal done.\u201d  \u201cRegardless of what happens on the appeal front, expect Comcast to put forth an all cash bid in the next day or so at a premium to Disney. This will then trigger Disney coming in with a higher price. They are already lining up cash to increase that offer. The question then will be how will the Murdoch family decide which offer they take. There complexities around taxes, voting shares, antitrust concerns depending on who the winner is.\u201d  \u201cThe other interesting factor here is that on June 15th, it is likely that the EU will ok Comcast buying Sky - this will likely lead the Sky board to recommend a Comcast-Sky deal go forward. There are still too many complexities around Fox-Sky. Assuming Disney wins Fox, Fox still has to sell Sky News as well as raise its offer for Sky to meet Comcast\u2019s.\u201d  \u201cThere are a lot of moving pieces. All I know is that this will be a blockbuster summer for media mergers!\u201d  MARKET REACTION:  AT&T shares fell 2.8 percent in afterhours trading. Ahead of the ruling, its shares gained 0.5 percent to close at $34.35.  Time Warner shares gained 4.3 percent in afterhours trading.

The stakes are high for AT&T, which is saddled with debt from a $134 billion acquisition spree to combine media conglomerate Time Warner and satellite TV provider DirecTV with the second-largest U.S. wireless phone company by subscribers.  The success of HBO Max is in many ways a referendum on a strategy to merge content with the means to distribute it.  To make it work, AT&T has committed to invest between $1.5 billion to $2 billion in HBO Max content next year and an additional $1 billion in 2021 and 2022, executives said this week after reporting tepid media results for the third quarter.  The investment falls far short of its biggest rival Netflix Inc, which has earmarked $15 billion in cash on content spending in 2019. But AT&T and WarnerMedia executives intend to play up why they believe they deserve a seat at a table that also includes Apple Inc, Walt Disney Co and Amazon.com.  WarnerMedia Chief Executive John Stankey, who was recently elevated to the role of chief operating officer of all of AT&T in a sign of just how critical the performance of HBO Max is to the company, and other executives including WarnerMedia Entertainment Chairman Robert Greenblatt will also discuss how the company plans to bundle the streaming service with other AT&T products across the portfolio to quickly add new customers.  This month Stankey told Reuters that HBO Max will be available this spring to 10 million current AT&T customers in the United States -- a mix of wireless, satellite TV, and some HBO Now subscribers -- at no extra charge.  By 2025, AT&T aims to reach about 80 million global subscribers, with about 50 million of these coming from the United States, a source briefed on the plans told Reuters.  Executives said investors and analysts gathering at Stage 21 on the Warner Brothers Studio lot in Burbank, California, on Tuesday should expect to hear about the breadth of new original programming and the depth of WarnerMedia\u2019s extensive library of films and TV series -- likely with appearances from well-known entertainers and producers.  Although the Warner Brothers library includes popular content like \u201cThe Shining\u201d and \u201cScooby-Doo\u201d -- and the HBO brand is known for edgy, high-quality programming -- it does not have the same brand awareness as Pixar, Marvel or Disney properties that will be included in the Disney+ streaming service that is launching on Nov. 12.  And as one of the latest entries in the streaming wars, by its spring launch HBO Max will be competing for household dollars that may have already been allocated to rivals.  Price could also be a challenge: HBO Max is likely to cost slightly more than the $14.99 the company charges for HBO -- significantly more than competing services from Apple ($4.99) and Disney ($6.99), and slightly higher than the standard $12.99 plan from Netflix.  WarnerMedia is hoping that with HBO Max, it can continue serving HBO\u2019s core over-40 audience, and expand to include younger viewers who may prefer to stream content and do not want to pay for cable.  \u201cThis is a product that\u2019s going to be very different from anything else that you\u2019ve seen in the market so far,\u201d AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said on Monday. \u201cThis is not Netflix. This is not Disney. This is HBO Max.\u201d","70":"An AT&T logo is pictured in Pasadena, California, U.S., January 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department presented evidence on Thursday to show that AT&T T.N, owner of DirecTV, viewed buying Time Warner TWX.N as a way to make viewers stick with their pay TV service instead of moving to cheaper online providers.  The department has sued to block AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner, saying the deal could raise prices for pay-TV rivals and subscribers while hampering the development of online video.  In a hearing before U.S. Judge Richard Leon, Justice Department attorney Julie Elmer cited an email and report in which Gregory Manty, a director of corporate strategy for AT&T, indicated that buying Time Warner\u2019s content would allow AT&T to slow the decline of pay TV, which was described as a \u201ccash cow.\u201d  Elmer pushed Manty to agree that the report had been \u201csanitized,\u201d noting that some phrases were removed by AT&T executives or outside counsel.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t use the word \u2018sanitized,\u2019\u201d Manty said, noting that the powerpoint deck had been used in discussions with Time Warner about potential integration.

Coaxial TV Cables are seen in front of AT&T and Time Warner logos in this picture illustration taken June 13, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  Judge Richard Leon of the US District Court for the District of Columbia ruled the deal could go ahead - over a year after it was first announced.  The ruling, released after 4pm ET, came with no conditions, and the Judge urged the government not to seek a stay of ruling, according to Reuters News.  AT&T General Counsel David McAtee said the company will close the merger on or before June 20.  The trial lasted for six weeks, with the government suing to stop the deal over concerns about its impact on competitors and consumers.  \u201cWe will closely review the Court\u2019s opinion and consider next steps in light of our commitment to preserving competition for the benefit of American consumers,\u201d Assistant US Attorney General Makin Delrahim, said in a statement.  Reuters reported that the merger, including debt, would be the fourth largest deal ever attempted in the global telecom, media and entertainment space, according to Thomson Reuters data. It would also be the 12th largest deal in any sector, the data showed.  AT&T closed at US$34.35, up 0.49%. Time Warner closed at US$96.22, up 0.052%.  After the ruling, AT&T was down 2.125% and Time Warner was up 4.55% in extended trade.  The ruling clears the way for the telecom giant to restart its merger engine, and could prompt a jumbo bond issue sized up to US$18bn, two investors said.  Also, the ruling may spur other companies to pursue mergers.  \u201cThere is no way to escape it,\u201d Jason Shoup, senior portfolio manager at Legal & General Investment Management America, told IFR, referring to AT&T\u2019s need for capital.  However, to get the deal done, AT&T might find itself having to pay up this time around as market volatility has increased, with average high-grade bond spreads widening by over 10bp.  The last time it tapped the capital markets in July, the company only had to pay investors 3.5bp-9bp in new issue concessions when it brought a US$22.5bn blockbuster bond deal for the proposed merger.  Around US$17bn of those bonds were taken out at 101 in April as part of a mandatory redemption because the merger had not been completed.  Market players say they\u2019re expecting AT&T\u2019s go-ahead to unleash further M&A activity down the road - much of which will be funded in the credit markets.  \u201cCEOs and bankers are going to tout this decision as a sign of a more benign regulatory attitude towards consolidation,\u201d David Knutson, head of credit research at Schroders, said.  And as the cycle continues to mature, companies are more likely to fund their acquisitions with debt, leaving credit investors at a further disadvantage, he said.  \u201cWe could see some pressure on spreads,\u201d Knutson said.  EARLY BIRD  AT&T\u2019s bond deal could come sooner rather than later, as the company will want to get ahead of a growing M&A bond pipeline that includes Comcast, Shoup said.  Comcast said Tuesday that it is preparing to announce a bid for Fox\u2019s assets on Wednesday if the AT&T\/Time Warner deal is approved.  The US cable company may have to raise as much as US$60bn of debt to finance a potential deal for Fox.  The US stance on AT&T\u2019s purchase of Time Warner has formed a big piece of the M&A puzzle when it comes to competition.  Other tie-ups in the regulatory queue include the US$26bn planned T-Mobile acquisition of rival Sprint and Disney\u2019s US$66bn bid for Twenty-First Century Fox assets.  Another wild card could be whether Verizon, AT&T\u2019s main competitor, is forced to respond to the acquisition with a mega M&A of its own, Janelle Woodward, global co-head of income at BMO Global Asset Management, said.  AT&T and Verizon are two of the largest corporate issuers in the index, each with a capital stack of well over US$100bn.  \u201cThe question then becomes how investors might look at the composition of the benchmark in terms of scaling risk and exposure,\u201d Woodward said, referring to BAML high-grade corporate index. \u201cHow much absolute risk level do you want for any one issuer?\u201d","75":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. wireless carrier Verizon Communications will suspend donations by its political action committee to lawmakers who did not back the certification of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory last week, a spokesman told Reuters.

The company\u2019s stock was originally scheduled to debut on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \u201cVRIO\u201d on Thursday.  Cable television service providers have been facing tough competition as the industry battles with customers cancelling accounts and moving to video streaming services such as Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Amazon Prime.  AT&T\u2019s initial plan was to sell Vrio to pay down debt which will increase to about $180 billion once its acquisition of Time Warner Inc closes.  AT&T in February filed confidentially for an IPO for the unit, which includes satellite and cable television services in Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, among others, prompting analysts to say that the No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier probably was not able to find a buyer.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - What\u2019s the value of having friends? For AT&T, the answer seems to be about $100 million. That\u2019s how much the telecoms group may charge streaming service Netflix to show the hit TV show of that name for another year. Given AT&T\u2019s plans to launch its own video service, depriving a rival of a blockbuster might have been smarter.  Netflix founder Reed Hastings has done a service to die-hard Ross and Rachel fans who had an online meltdown when it appeared \u201cFriends\u201d might be leaving the platform. On the face of it, though, he is paying a high price. The $100 million reported by the New York Times is more than triple what Netflix originally paid.  That said, the $120 billion Netflix ought to be able to tell a bad deal from a good one. The service has a vast trove of data on what its 130 million viewers want to watch. Sure, Hastings is spending on programming like a drunken sailor \u2013 Netflix\u2019s streaming content obligations are nearly $19 billion \u2013 but that is because he anticipated a bitter war with other media companies. Walt Disney\u2019s Bob Iger, for instance, is pulling most of the Magic Kingdom\u2019s fare off Netflix in preparation for its own forthcoming video product.  The big mystery is why Dallas-based AT&T would want Netflix to have \u201cFriends\u201d at all. It is planning to roll out its own direct-to-consumer video service in the fourth quarter of next year, having bought Time Warner for $85 billion. AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said on Tuesday the goal is not to become another Netflix. But it\u2019s not like that would be a bad thing: Netflix\u2019s stock has doubled in two years, even after the recent tumble in tech shares.  Stephenson could have held out, watched Netflix users weep via Twitter, and transferred the show to, say, his own struggling DirecTV Now service. The fact he didn\u2019t raises the possibility that AT&T really wants the money. A $220 billion company shouldn\u2019t need to scrape around for such relatively tiny amounts, but this one has roughly $180 billion in debt to pay down. Either way, sharing \u201cFriends\u201d with Netflix suggests AT&T isn\u2019t cut out for the media shark-tank.","78":"(Reuters) - AT&T Inc missed fourth-quarter revenue estimates on Wednesday as another decline in subscriptions to satellite TV provider DirecTV overshadowed an increase in monthly phone customers.

AT&T shares were down 3.1% to $37.37 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Analysts at Cowen had estimated AT&T would lose a net 1 million premium TV customers, leaving the company with 19.4 million.  To counter the loss of customers to streaming platforms like Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Prime, AT&T plans to launch its own HBO Max streaming platform in May.  It said it added a net 229,000 new mobile phone customers in the quarter. Analysts had estimated an additional 145,000 phone subscribers, according to research firm FactSet.  AT&T reaffirmed its 2020 guidance, with plans to invest $1.5 billion to $2 billion on streaming content in 2020, and an additional $1 billion in 2021 and 2022.  Total operating revenue in the quarter ended Dec. 31 fell 2.4% to $46.82 billion. Analysts were expecting $46.96 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The WarnerMedia segment, which includes HBO, reported revenue of $8.92 billion, missing analysts\u2019 estimates of $9.03 billion.  The company said it stopped licensing content, including the popular sitcom \u201cFriends,\u201d to other streaming services like Netflix as the launch of HBO Max nears.

Millions more Americans are expected to work from home as employers ask people who can telecommute to skip going to the office.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The consideration, which has not been previously disclosed, underscores AT&T\u2019s commitment to the advertising business as the U.S. phone carrier reviews its portfolio to identify assets to sell in order to reduce its debt load. AT&T is considering selling its advertising-technology unit Xandr, sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters.  \u201cI believe there\u2019s a segment of our customer base where given a choice, they would take some load of advertising for a $5 or $10 reduction in their mobile bill,\u201d Stankey said.  Various companies including Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Virgin Mobile USA and Sprint's Boost Mobile have tested advertising supported phone services since the early 2000s but they have not caught on. AT&T is hoping that better advertising targeting could revive the idea.  The planned launch of an ad-supported version of AT&T\u2019s video-streaming service HBO Max next year will serve as a \u201cfoundational element\u201d that will provide new advertising inventory, and would be key to new phone plans supported by ads, Stankey said without offering details.  Stankey said ad-supported phone plans could be introduced in \u201ca year or two.\u201d  AT&T engineers are creating \u201cunified customer identifiers,\u201d Stankey said. Such technology would allow marketers to identify users across multiple devices and serve them relevant advertising.  The ability to fine tune ad targeting would allow AT&T to sell ads at higher rates, he said.  AT&T has invested in developing targeted advertising on its own media properties using data from its phone, TV and internet customers, but the company has been \u201cslower in coming up the curve\u201d on expanding its marketplace that allows advertisers to use AT&T data to target other media companies\u2019 audiences, Stankey said.  In March, AT&T's Xandr struck a deal to partner with Walt Disney Co DIS.N and AMC Networks AMCX.O to let advertisers buy TV commercials across the networks.  AT&T\u2019s advertising marketplace, which incorporates data from outside AT&T, could face privacy challenges as consumers express rising concern about tracking of their media use across platforms and laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act have been passed.  \u201cI don\u2019t know if we can count on it in perpetuity,\u201d Stankey said, referring to the use of non-AT&T-owned data.  Stankey, who last week penned an op-ed for Politico stating that the U.S. government should provide subsidies to encourage companies to build fiber broadband networks in underserved areas, said in the Reuters interview that AT&T believes it could double its fiber footprint if it had the economic incentive.  Fiber or fiber optics are thin cables often installed underground that allow companies to deliver internet services to homes. AT&T uses fiber to deliver internet to homes and businesses as well as to power its 5G network.  AT&T\u2019s fiber currently passes 18 million homes in the United States. The company could grow that number by 3 million to 5 million homes per year, he added.","83":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T Inc, the No. 2 wireless carrier, on Thursday closed its $85 billion deal to acquire media company Time Warner Inc after U.S. antitrust regulators indicated they would not seek a delay.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The deal, first announced in October 2016, was opposed by President Donald Trump. AT&T was sued by the Justice Department, but won approval from a judge to move forward with the deal on Tuesday following a six-week trial.  The Justice Department still has 60 days to appeal the decision by U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, even though the deal has closed.  Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled on Tuesday that the deal to marry AT&T\u2019s wireless and satellite businesses with Time Warner\u2019s movies and television shows was legal under antitrust law. The Justice Department had argued the deal would harm consumers.  U.S. President Donald Trump, a frequent critic of Time Warner\u2019s CNN coverage, denounced the deal when it was announced in October 2016.  In its lawsuit aimed at stopping the deal, filed in November 2017, the Justice Department said that AT&T\u2019s ownership of both DirecTV and Time Warner, especially its Turner subsidiary, would give AT&T unfair leverage against rival pay TV providers that relied on content like CNN and HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d  The AT&T ruling is expected to trigger a wave of mergers in the media sector, which has been upended by companies like Netflix Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google.  The first to come was Comcast Corp\u2019s $65 billion bid on Wednesday for the entertainment assets of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.  AT&T had been worried about closing its deal ahead of a June 21 deadline if the government won a stay pending an appeal. Any stay could take the deal beyond a June 21 deadline for completing the merger, which could allow Time Warner to walk away or renegotiate the proposed transaction with AT&T.  The government may have a difficult time winning on appeal because of the way Judge Leon wrote his opinion, four antitrust experts said.  \u201cI don\u2019t think this would be overturned. It is so rooted in the facts that I would be surprised if an appellate court overturned such a fact-laden opinion,\u201d said Michael Carrier, who teaches law at Rutgers.  In a scathing opinion bit.ly\/2Jxx6qE, Leon found little to support the government's arguments that the deal would harm consumers, calling the evidence for one argument against the deal \"gossamer thin\" and another \"poppycock.\"  The merger, including debt, would be the fourth largest deal ever attempted in the global telecom, media and entertainment space, according to Thomson Reuters data. It would also be the 12th largest deal in any sector, the data showed.","84":"(Reuters) - AT&T Inc\u2019s advertising unit Xandr said Wednesday it is partnering with Walt Disney Co, AMC Networks and sister company WarnerMedia to make it easier for advertisers to buy TV commercials across the networks.  Since forming Xandr in 2018, phone carrier AT&T has sought to allow advertisers to target certain audiences using AT&T data, which it gathers from offering phone, internet and TV services. The moves are part of an effort by the TV industry as a whole to catch up to digital advertising behemoths like Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Facebook, where the ability to target ads has long been more advanced.  Advertisers will be able to use a new version of a self-serve tool called Xandr Invest to define an audience they want to reach, such as people in the market to buy a car, and then place a single order through the tool that will find the commercial slots across its partners that will reach those viewers.  WarnerMedia, which is also owned by AT&T, includes cable channels like TNT and CNN, while Disney owns broadcaster ABC and sports network ESPN. AMC Networks includes the BBC America and IFC channels.  A benefit to partnering on Xandr Invest is the tool allows AMC to control the pricing of its ads and whom it works with, said Evan Adlman, senior vice president of advanced advertising and digital partnerships at AMC.  While Xandr Invest serves as the technology to buy ads and target audiences across the partners, the networks themselves will retain control in selling the ad space, said Mike Welch, executive vice president of product and business development at Xandr.  The new TV ad buying capabilities are meant to round out Xandr\u2019s appeal to advertisers, which historically had a focus on internet display ads, Welch added.  The new version of Xandr Invest launches just ahead of the upfront season in May, a critical annual advertising sales period where brands preview the upcoming TV season and buy commercials in advance.","85":"An AT&T logo is pictured in Pasadena, California, U.S., January 24, 2018.

The acquisition had been closely watched in political circles after coming under fire from U.S. President Donald Trump, who opposed it because he saw it helping Time Warner\u2019s CNN unit, which he has accused of broadcasting \u201cfake news.\u201d  The three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled unanimously in favor of the deal on Tuesday, saying that the government\u2019s case that the merger would result in higher consumer prices was \u201cunpersuasive.\u201d The decision ended a 15-month effort by the Justice Department to block the deal.  It was AT&T\u2019s second major court victory against the Justice Department, setting the stage for the No. 2 wireless carrier to integrate its WarnerMedia business as well as its new Xandr advertising unit.  \u201cWe are grateful that the Court of Appeals considered our objections to the District Court opinion.

McAtee said the merger \u201chas already yielded significant consumer benefits and will continue to do so for years to come.\u201d  The deal has been seen as a turning point for a media industry that has been upended by companies like Netflix Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google that put content online with no need for a cable subscription.  The merger, which was announced in October 2016, closed on June 14, 2018, shortly after U.S. District Judge Richard Leon ruled it was legal under antitrust law.  AT&T agreed to manage the Turner network separately until Feb. 28, or until the conclusion of any appeal by the Justice Department. AT&T also agreed it would have no role in setting Turner\u2019s prices to distributors and the number of Turner employees would remain largely unchanged.  The appeals court took a shot at Leon, who had been scathing in his assessment of the government\u2019s attempt to stop the deal.  \u201cUndoubtedly the district court made some problematic statements, which the government identifies and this court cannot ignore,\u201d the panel said in its opinion.

The Justice Department filed a lawsuit in November to stop AT&T, which owns DirecTV and other products with 25 million subscribers, from buying movie and TV show maker Time Warner, which owns HBO and CNN, among many other channels. A trial is set to start on Monday.  The government argues the merger would hike pay TV subscribers bills by $0.45 a month, citing an expert analysis.  AT&T contends that analysis is fatally flawed because it does not include its commitment for seven years to agree to binding arbitration over disputes with distributors like DISH Network Corp or Comcast Corp over licensing terms.  The commitment, AT&T and Time Warner said in a legal filing released on Tuesday, \u201cis a concrete assurance that this merger has never been about raising the price of Turner content.\u201d  Time Warner\u2019s Turner owns CNN, TBS, TNT and other networks that air news, sports and other programming. Last year, the government demanded AT&T agree to divest Turner as one offer to approve the merger.  The Justice Department said in a separate filing that the AT&T commitment was a \u201cunilateral promise\u201d that was not relevant to whether the transaction lessens competition. The government argues including the issue would \u201cwaste the court\u2019s limited time and confuse the proceedings.\u201d  AT&T asked U.S. District Judge Richard Leon to reject the request. John Stankey, the head of AT&T\u2019s entertainment group who is set to head the combined company\u2019s media business, said in a deposition that the company would not withdraw the commitment.  Leon is holding a closed-door pretrial conference with lawyers for both sides on Tuesday.  If Leon finds the transaction would harm competition, he could consider the commitment when he considers remedies, the Justice Department said.  The government\u2019s analysis assumed the combined AT&T Time Warner would have \u201cbargaining leverage\u201d that it could use to compel distributors to pay higher prices for Turner networks, citing a model by an economist, AT&T said.

AT&T\u2019s brief noted the government\u2019s lawsuit was the \u201cfirst litigated challenge to a vertical merger in four decades, prompting many press outlets to question whether the White House had improperly influenced DOJ\u2019s decision to bring the case.\u201d  Leon \u201cquashed discovery into that issue, effectively limiting the trial to the fundamental question\u201d of if the deal violated U.S. antitrust law,\u201d AT&T added.  In August, the Justice Department said Leon failed to take into account how companies negotiate with each other and seek to maximize profits in considering the Justice Department\u2019s arguments about how the deal would decrease competition.  In its brief, the government argued the court should have concluded that the merger would give Time Warner more clout at the bargaining table.  Leon ignored evidence regarding how companies use leverage to bargain with each other and failed to consider corporate efforts to increase their revenues, the government argued.  The court\u2019s errors \u201ccolored the court\u2019s view of the facts, leading to a decision that is clearly erroneous in light of the evidence presented at trial,\u201d the Justice Department said.  The core of the Justice Department\u2019s concern about the deal is that AT&T, which owns DirecTV, would use its ownership of Time Warner\u2019s content to make pay TV rivals pay more, thus raising their costs and forcing them to charge consumers more.  Oral arguments have not yet been scheduled by U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.","94":"(Reuters) - AT&T\u2019s WarnerMedia division launches its HBO Max streaming service on Wednesday, taking on Netflix, Disney and Amazon at a time when coronavirus lockdowns have boosted demand for streaming even as rising unemployment has cut disposable incomes.  HBO Max launches to a captive audience stuck at home without access to theater, live music, shopping excursions or live or televised sporting events. That situation helped Netflix Inc sign up 15.8 million new paying customers in the first three months of the year, more than double what it expected to attract.  But with film and TV productions halted across the globe, HBO Max has postponed dozens of releases - most notably a \u201cFriends\u201d reunion special originally planned for launch. If HBO Max does not resume production by this fall, the service could start to see a shortage of original content as early as January, according to a source familiar with the company.  At $15 per month, the service is more expensive than both the $7 per month Disney+ streaming service and the $13 per month standard Netflix plan. Still, WarnerMedia hopes to reach about 80 million global HBO Max subscribers by 2025.  Many existing HBO subscribers in the United States will not need to do anything to get the new service, as WarnerMedia revised deals with distributors including Apple Inc, Charter Communications Inc, Hulu and most recently, Comcast Corp.  But subscribers of HBO through Amazon.com Inc and Roku Inc are out of luck as WarnerMedia has yet to strike new agreements.  For these and new customers, WarnerMedia is offering a promotion for subscribing directly with the company: $3 off the regular $15 price. Some AT&T customers will also get it at no additional cost.  HBO Max will feature 10,000 hours of content from WarnerMedia brands and libraries such as Warner Bros, New Line Cinema and Cartoon Network. At launch it will include sixoriginal titles, including \u201cLove Life,\u201d a romantic comedy anthology series featuring Anna Kendrick, and a Sesame Workshop children\u2019s show \u201cThe Not Too Late Show with Elmo.\u201d  More original programming will come over time, including the DC Comics film \u201cJustice League,\u201d recut by director Zack Snyder.","95":"FILE PHOTO: HBO logo is on display during an Apple event in San Francisco, California, U.S., March 9, 2015.

The FTC did not immediately comment.  A federal appeals court in San Francisco in February reinstated the FTC lawsuit, which had been thrown out after AT&T argued that it was exempt from FTC regulations and that the Federal Communications Commission had jurisdiction.  The Federal Communications Commission separately in June 2015 proposed a $100 million fine for AT&T for misleading millions of customers about unlimited data plans. The FCC has never moved to finalize the fine.  The FCC said at the time that it was the largest such fine proposal. AT&T, which said it would \u201cvigorously dispute the FCC\u2019s assertions,\u201d said that the FCC had previously deemed the practice a legitimate and reasonable way to manage its network and that it had been \u201cfully transparent with our customers, providing notice in multiple ways and going well beyond the FCC\u2019s disclosure requirements.\u201d  AT&T said it had disclosed its slowdown practices to consumers over bill statement notifications, text messages and other means.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The U.S. government is seeking to stop the $85 billion deal, arguing that it would hurt consumers. Monday\u2019s testimony was the second day of the trial that is due to last six to eight weeks.  Testifying for the government, Warren Schlichting, who negotiates to buy programming for DISH\u2019s satellite and its Sling internet business, said that his company needed to have the rights to broadcast some Time Warner content, especially news like CNN and sports, like college basketball\u2019s March Madness, in order to attract and keep subscribers.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine spring without March Madness. It\u2019s hard to imagine an election without CNN,\u201d he said.  The clout that the deal would give AT&T in negotiating with pay TV competitors is why Justice Department filed suit in November to stop AT&T, which has some 25 million pay-TV subscribers, from closing the merger. AT&T says a merger would benefit consumers by creating efficiencies.  Schlichting agreed that AT&T\u2019s purchase of Time Warner would give it the incentive to sharply raise rates or withhold Time Warner\u2019s sports, news, movies and TV shows if the judge hearing the case allows the merger to go forward.  \u201cWe need each other now,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the merger that changes 180 (degrees).\u201d  Schlichting\u2019s testimony echoed that of Cox Communications content buyer Suzanne Fenwick, who last week described Time Warner\u2019s movies, television shows and sports programming as \u201cmust-have content\u201d for the cable TV provider.  Monday\u2019s hearing was delayed because Schlichting\u2019s counsel gave him transcripts of opening arguments and Fenwick\u2019s testimony from last Thursday, which is not allowed, said Judge Richard Leon, who is deciding the case.  \u201cIf this happens again, hopefully it will not, the witness will be struck,\u201d he said.  If the government loses, that could open up the field for more tie-ups between distributors and content providers. But a win could strengthen the hand of antitrust regulators looking at other, similarly structured mergers.  Unlike most merger trials, this one is closely watched in political circles since President Donald Trump publicly criticized the deal as a candidate and as president, and the Republican president often has excoriated Time Warner\u2019s CNN news network.","100":"March 6 (Reuters) - At&T Inc:  * AT&T COLLABORATES WITH AIRA TO DEVELOP NEW AI POWERED PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION READER  * SAYS COMPANIES ARE WORKING THROUGH AT&T FOUNDRY TO DEVELOP SOLUTION Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","101":"(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department and 11 states filed an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google on Tuesday for allegedly breaking the law in using its market power to fend off rivals.

The Subcommittee\u2019s investigation uncovered extensive evidence showing that Google maintained and extended its monopoly to harm competition. It is critical that the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit focuses on Google\u2019s monopolization of search and search advertising, while also targeting the anticompetitive business practices Google is using to leverage this monopoly into other areas, such as maps, browsers, video, and voice assistants.\u201d  DAVE HEGER, SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, EDWARD JONES  \u201cThe lawsuit will likely take years to be argued in court, and at this stage, the DOJ is not proposing any extreme remedial action, such as breaking apart the company.

In a 69-page complaint filed with the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Terpin alleged that on January 7, 2018, the tokens were stolen from him through what he alleged was a \u201cdigital identity theft\u201d of his cellphone account. In the complaint, he said AT&T was his service provider.  In an emailed response, an AT&T spokesman said: \u201cWe dispute these allegations and look forward to presenting our case in court.\u201d  At the time of the theft, the three million stolen tokens were worth $23.8 million, the complaint said. Terpin is also seeking $200 million in punitive damages.  The complaint said that AT&T had been previously contacted by law enforcement authorities about such frauds.  Cryptocurrencies have a market capitalization of about $200 billion, according to data from virtual coin tracker coinmarketcap.com. Nine years after bitcoin came into existence, the market has seen the emergence of more than 1,800 digital currencies.  Terpin, represented by Los Angeles litigation firm Greenberg Glusker, claimed in the lawsuit that after the theft of the digital currency, his cellphone account was transferred to an international criminal gang.  Terpin co-founded the first angel group for bitcoin investors, BitAngels, in early 2013, and the first digital currency fund, the BitAngels\/Dapps Fund, in March 2014. He is a senior advisor to Alphabit Fund, one of the world\u2019s largest digital currency hedge funds.  The complaint claimed that the theft of the tokens occurred through what is called a SIM swap fraud. SIM stands for subscriber identification module, and SIM cards are used to authenticate subscribers on mobile phones.  SIM swapping consists of tricking a provider into transferring a subscriber\u2019s phone number to a SIM card controlled by someone else. Once that person gets the phone number, it can be used to reset the subscriber\u2019s passwords and access online accounts.","103":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - William Barr, nominated by President Donald Trump to become U.S. attorney general, plans to recuse himself from a major antitrust case, according to people who spoke with him on Thursday, as he navigates possible conflicts of interest presented by about $37 million in assets he amassed as a private-sector lawyer.  U.S. Attorney General nominee William Barr attends a meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., January 9, 2019. REUTERS\/Jim Young  Barr is scheduled to go before the Senate Judiciary Committee next week for two days of confirmation hearings. Ahead of that, he has submitted financial disclosure forms, as required. Some of the forms, seen by Reuters, describe sizeable investments in stocks, bonds and real estate.  Among his holdings are $1.2 million worth of shares in telecommunications and media company AT&T Inc. He served on the board of Time Warner, which was acquired by AT&T last year, from 2009 until 2018.  The Justice Department, which Barr would lead as attorney general, fought and lost a court battle to block the $85 billion deal and has appealed the decision.  Barr told Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar he would recuse himself from that effort if he were confirmed, Klobuchar said.  \u201cHe told me he was going to recuse himself from the Time Warner-AT&T appeal because he was involved in that, the Time Warner side,\u201d Klobuchar told reporters after meeting with Barr.  She added that she plans to review his financial disclosures more carefully over the weekend.  A Justice Department official, familiar with Barr\u2019s confirmation preparation, confirmed that he plans to recuse himself from the matter.  Barr is set to face tough questioning in the confirmation hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday from Democrats who have raised concerns about his past criticism of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.  Senators who will vet his nomination will likely closely examine the disclosures, which trickled in later than usual on Thursday due to a partial government shutdown which has furloughed many of the government\u2019s ethics attorneys.  According to the documents, Barr owns about $16 million worth of stocks and bonds, as well as another $8 million in private investments and $4.2 million in real estate.  As of Dec. 14, he held $2.8 million worth of Dominion Energy Inc stock, his largest holding. Barr served on Dominion\u2019s board of directors, as well.  Under federal ethics rules, Barr will be required to divest certain holdings if they conflict with particular matters he is working on at the Justice Department.  Presidential nominees also must sign an ethics pledge that spells out how potential conflicts will be managed.  Other stocks in his portfolio include tobacco company Altria Group Inc and drugmakers Merck & Co Inc and Pfizer Inc.  Reuters could not immediately determine which assets, if any, he may need to divest, but the same Justice Department official said government ethics lawyers are working on a divestment plan.  Barr will also be required to disclose some details about which clients he or his law firm have recently represented in order to avoid potential conflicts.  In his questionnaire to the Senate, he disclosed he represented construction machinery and equipment maker Caterpillar Inc in 2017 in connection with a Justice Department grand jury probe and recently was retained to provide regulatory advice for the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management [CBS.UL].  Other possible conflict questions that could come up include the fact that his daughter and both of his sons-in-law currently work at the Justice Department.","104":"(Reuters) - HBO Max, the forthcoming streaming service from AT&T Inc.-owned WarnerMedia, will be available on Apple Inc. devices when it launches on May 27, the company said on Monday.

The Justice Department on Friday moved to prevent AT&T from arguing that politics played a role in the government\u2019s decision to stop the merger, which Trump has publicly criticized. (Reporting by Diane Bartz and David Shepardson; Editing by Leslie Adler)","108":"(Reuters) - AT&T Inc T.N on Friday ousted its top lobbyist, and the No. 2 wireless carrier's chief executive said it was a \"big mistake\" to hire Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's personal attorney, for advice on working with the Trump administration.  AT&T paid Essential Consultants LLC, a firm set up by Cohen, a total of $600,000 over 2017 for the advice. Cohen and others were hired to help navigate \"a wide range of issues,\" including its proposed $85 billion merger with Time Warner Inc TWX.N, CEO Randall Stephenson said in a memo seen by Reuters.  The disclosure of AT&T\u2019s relationship with Cohen has turned into a major embarrassment for the telecommunications company as it awaits a U.S. judge\u2019s decision, due June 12, on whether it can go through with the purchase of Time Warner, a deal that has been denounced by Trump.  \u201cThere is no other way to say it \u2013 AT&T hiring Michael Cohen as a political consultant was a big mistake,\u201d the memo said.  President Trump expressed opposition to the merger with Time Warner during the campaign and his administration ultimately chose to fight it, with the Justice Department filing suit in November to block the agreement.  In a fact sheet that accompanied the memo, AT&T said Cohen approached them about working on their behalf in the post-election transition. He was given a one-year contract at $50,000 per month, which ran from January through December 2017, that was limited to consulting and advisory services.  AT&T never asked Cohen to set up meetings with anyone in the Trump administration, and he did not offer to do so, it said.

REUTERS\/Carlos Barria  \u201cTo be clear, everything we did was done according to the law and entirely legitimate,\u201d Stephenson wrote in the memo. \u201cBut the fact is our past association with Cohen was a serious misjudgment.\u201d  Stephenson said he took responsibility for the Washington team\u2019s failure to vet Cohen.  AT&T\u2019s head lobbyist, Bob Quinn, who oversaw the hiring of Cohen, is retiring, according to the memo. But two sources familiar with the situation said Quinn was forced to retire.  The sources requested anonymity because they are not permitted to speak to the media. Quinn did not respond to a request for comment.  AT&T\u2019s board of directors does not hold Stephenson responsible for the lack of vetting, according to one source.  The AT&T payments were first revealed by Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who also said a company owned by Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg and other corporations paid Essential Consultants for certain services. Avenatti would not say how he obtained the information.  Shares of AT&T rose 1.3 percent to close at $32.29.  Touting his close relationship with Trump, Cohen offered to provide consulting services to Ford Motor CoF.N but his overture was quickly rejected, even before any specific fees were discussed, a person briefed on the matter said on Friday.  Mueller\u2019s team learned of Cohen\u2019s January 2017 offer and has asked Ford for information and records about it and has interviewed Ford\u2019s head of government affairs Ziad Ojakli, the person said.  The office of Robert Mueller, special counsel in the Russia probe, asked Ford about the matter last year and it was unclear if it had made any recent inquiries, the person said.  An attorney for Cohen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Cohen\u2019s outreach to Ford was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.  Drugmaker Novartis NOVN.S said on Wednesday it had a $1.2 million contract with Cohen's firm, but soon realized the agreement was a mistake.  Essential Consultants paid $130,000 to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, days before the 2016 presidential election as part of a nondisclosure agreement that barred her from discussing an alleged sexual encounter with Trump. He denies any encounter took place.","109":"FILE PHOTO: The AT&T logo is seen on a monitor on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S. June 13, 2018.

FILE PHOTO - An AT&T logo is pictured in Pasadena, California, U.S., January 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni  U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, who will decide the case, delayed opening arguments until Thursday because of bad weather in Washington. The government has asked Leon to rule that the $85 billion deal is illegal because it would hurt cable television rivals and, by extension, their consumers.  The government estimates that the deal would hike an average subscriber\u2019s monthly cable bill by 45 cents. It filed its lawsuit in November.  At a hearing to discuss how to handle sensitive business information in the trial, AT&T lawyer Daniel Petrocelli said it would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for Time Warner to withhold programming in hopes that disgruntled customers would drop their cable company and sign up with AT&T\u2019s DirecTV, as the government has said they could do.  Petrocelli argued that Time Warner would lose millions of dollars a month in fees and advertising, and that the few subscribers that DirecTV could gain would not make up the difference.  He also pointed to a voluntary commitment that AT&T made to distributors to refrain from withholding programming if there is an impasse in licensing talks. Twenty of its 1,000 distributors signed on.  Justice Department lawyer Craig Conrath said the government\u2019s first two witnesses, whom he did not identify, would discuss their companies\u2019 negotiations in buying Time Warner content.  \u201cWhat drives these customers to have concerns is that their negotiating partner (Time Warner) is being acquired by someone they compete with,\u201d said Conrath.  An official from Google's YouTube GOOGL.O will testify on the importance of Time Warner's Turner family of stations, which includes CNN, to DirecTV's rivals, a government lawyer said previously.  AT&T's Petrocelli also noted the role of big technology companies such as Facebook FB.O, Amazon AMZN.O, AppleAAPL.O, Netflix NFLX.O and Google in transforming how people watch television and, more to the point, winning away advertisers from the pay TV companies.  \u201cThey are running away with the industry,\u201d said Petrocelli, noting the internet companies\u2019 skill at targeting ads to the right consumer. \u201cCable bills can\u2019t go up any more because people won\u2019t pay any more.\u201d  Conrath indicated that an expert on advertising, whom he did not identify, would testify on this issue.  AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson and Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes are also expected to testify. The trial is expected to last six to eight weeks.  Justice Department lawyer Don Kempf urged the judge to reject AT&T\u2019s arguments that some government evidence was nothing more than draft reports written by junior executives, and not indicative of the thinking of top executives.  At issue, was a document that appeared to show that AT&T\u2019s business people saw the merger as a way to prevent market changes that would encourage cord-cutting.  Kempf said the preliminary documents show the \u201creal truth\u201d of AT&T\u2019s thinking. \u201cThe final version isn\u2019t the thoughts of the business people. It\u2019s the cover story of the lawyers,\u201d he said.  Looming over the trial is the question of whether U.S. President Donald Trump, who criticized the deal on the campaign trail and again as president, may have influenced the Justice Department\u2019s decision to oppose the transaction.

In testimony that began late Tuesday and ended on Wednesday, Turner networks Chief Executive John Martin said the company had no incentive to hold back its CNN, TBS and TNT content from other distributors if parent Time Warner was bought by AT&T.

A federal judge earlier this month approved the merger of AT&T and Time Warner, handing AT&T a win after the U.S. Department of Justice sued to stop the deal, saying a merger would give AT&T unfair leverage over rival pay-TV providers.

Warner Bros said in a statement that Depp \u201cwill depart the \u2018Fantastic Beasts\u2019 franchise,\u201d and that his role would be recast.  Depp recently resumed production on the third film in the spinoff from \u201cHarry Potter\u201d author J.K. Rowling. Warner Bros said on Friday its release date had been pushed back to summer 2022 from November 2021.  Rowling - herself a survivor of domestic abuse - declined to comment on Depp\u2019s departure.  His exit marked a relatively rare move by Hollywood to recast an actor on ethical grounds.  Kevin Spacey\u2019s role in \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d was reshot with Christopher Plummer in 2017 after Spacey was accused by more than 20 men of sexual misconduct. Spacey has not commented since making an apology to his first accuser.  Charlie Sheen was fired in 2011 from television\u2019s top-rated \u201cTwo and a Half Men\u201d after months of drink and drug-fueled partying. He was replaced by Ashton Kutcher.  Depp, 57, who plans to appeal the London libel judgment, wrote that his \u201clife and career will not be defined by this moment.\u201d  The \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d star had sued the publishers of the Sun newspaper after it said he had been violent toward former wife Amber Heard, 34. The newspaper also questioned his casting in the \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d franchise.  The three-week libel trial in July heard evidence from both Depp and Heard about a tempestuous marriage marked by violence on both sides and of heavy drinking by Depp. The judge on Monday ruled against Depp.  Rowling had come under fire in 2017 for casting Depp in the first \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d movie after initial details of his 2016 divorce from Heard were made public.  Rowling said at the time that the circumstances of the divorce were a private matter.

The Comcast NBC logo is shown on a building in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 13, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  The federal judge\u2019s ruling in favor of the US$85bn AT&T\/Time Warner tie-up, first announced in October 2016, without any conditions, removed an obstacle for debt markets after several huge, high profile technology and healthcare deals were scuttled by antitrust or national security concerns.  \u201cAfter the AT&T news, people have a much more optimistic view on the regulatory front, and I think that will push bankers to pitch more on M&A,\u201d said one senior banker. \u201cThere\u2019s more of a willingness to look at vertical integrations,\u201d in which a company buys a supplier.  Comcast, in announcing its Walt Disney Co-topping bid, said it had \u201chighly confident\u201d letters from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo that the banks can secure the needed financing for the proposed acquisition.  A considerable amount of the needed financing was already put in place before this newly raised bid. In April, the company said it lined up \u00a323bn (US$32bn) of loans led by BAML and Wells Fargo.  The existing credit comprises up to \u00a316bn of 364-day bridge loans and up to \u00a37bn of term loans, with the bridge expected to be replaced in part or in full by senior unsecured bonds, LPC previously reported.  BAML and Wells Fargo declined to comment.  The AT&T victory \u201cdoes make people feel a bit more of a risk appetite for complex transactions on the regulatory front,\u201d said another banker.  Vertical transactions tend to be better for the M&A market because they allow companies to get into complementary areas for growth, as opposed to horizontal deals which focus more on synergies and cost cutting, he said. \u201cThat can be pretty helpful to the overall M&A market.\u201d  Corporations buying other companies for growth have helped drive total M&A lending up to US$326bn so far this year, a 39% leap above the same time last year, according to LPC data.  Attention shifts next to Disney, and whether it answers Comcast\u2019s bid by increasing its US$52bn all-stock agreement to purchase Fox\u2019s film, television and international businesses.  And still in the regulatory review line is T-Mobile\u2019s US$26bn proposed merger with Sprint, two leading wireless carrier competitors, in what is considered a horizontal deal.  HIGHLY CONFIDENT  As for Comcast\u2019s new financing, banks typically provide \u201chighly confident\u201d letters as a tactic used for large hostile takeovers, that allows borrowers to avoid paying fees on funds committed by banks to a huge deal that may not take place.  Banks do not immediately tie up their balance sheets, as a result, while signaling to markets that financing will be there if the deal is approved.  Similarly, five initial banks indicated their confidence this way last November for chipmaker Broadcom\u2019s unsolicited bid to buy rival Qualcomm. The lending group was later expanded and provided US$100bn of financing \u2013 the largest loan package ever \u2013 before the deal was ultimately canceled as President Trump blocked the merger over national security concerns.  Banks remain eager to put money to work and see a more open dealmaking path after the AT&T\/Time Warner merger outcome.  \u201cNow that the judge has given the all-clear, without conditions, it\u2019s basically a free ride, and this will open up other opportunities for companies in the space that need to position themselves,\u201d a third banker said.","126":"Nov 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear a bid by the National Football League and AT&T Inc\u2019s DirecTV unit to avoid a proposed class-action antitrust lawsuit that accuses them of overcharging for a popular satellite television package.

The move comes just one month after the U.S. wireless carrier announced it would resume buying advertising on YouTube, after a nearly two-year boycott of the platform.

FILE PHOTO: An AT&T logo is pictured in Pasadena, California, U.S., January 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni  Carol Rice, assistant inspector general for audit and evaluation, said in a memo published on May 3 this year that her office was reviewing how well the department\u2019s First Responder Network Authority, also known as FirstNet, was carrying out its mandate to create and run a new national emergency responders network.  The network, which authorities have been considering since the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington, is supposed to provide vast new capacity for communication among emergency officials and crews.  The contract to build and run the network was awarded to AT&T in March 2017, but within communications industry and among emergency responders the contract has generated controversy.  Critics have questioned the need for a large new network and also how well other companies\u2019 networks and AT&T\u2019s new network operate together.  The AT&T project is financed by $7 billion from federal government auctions of broadcast spectrum and another $40 billion from AT&T.  The audit aims to determine whether FirstNet \u201cproperly administered\u201d a departmental task order covering the deployment, operation and maintenance of the new emergency network, Rice said in her memo. The audit is expected to take about a year.  Government and AT&T officials involved with the contract said the inspector general\u2019s audit was routine.  Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N, the world's largest wireless telecommunications company and AT&T's main rival, Verizon did not bid on the contract but has said it has already set aside considerable capacity for emergency use.  At a industry conference in March this year, Mike Maiorana, a Verizon senior vice president, said Verizon covers 400,000 more square miles than AT&T. \u201cAnd we\u2019re already working with our public-safety customers to build the solutions they need,\u201d he said. In comments to Reuters this week, Maiorana reaffirmed his comments about Verizon\u2019s capacity and its public safety customers.  This week government and AT&T officials told Reuters that the new network\u2019s core is already operational in all U.S. states. AT&T\u2019s contract gives it up to five years to construct further infrastructure for the network, including new towers and hanging new equipment on existing towers.  The officials also said this week that one way AT&T will pay for its $40 billion investment is by charging ordinary broadband users for commercial access to the network when it is not being used for emergencies. The new network is designed to rapidly preempt routine traffic to free bandwidth for emergency use, they said.  In an email to Reuters on Thursday AT&T said the new network would be fully interoperable with existing networks.  \u201cFirstNet is being built on open industry standards,\u201d AT&T said. \u201cSo that means first responders on FirstNet will be able to seamlessly communicate with customers on commercial core networks from AT&T, Verizon, Sprint or T-Mobile, and vice versa.\u201d  A spokeswoman for FirstNet said: \u201cThe FirstNet Core is built on physically separate hardware for a highly secure network. It separates public safety traffic from commercial traffic and provides them an always-on connection with priority and preemption.\u201d","129":"FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump stands in the Oval Office during a presentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom to NBA Hall of Famer Jerry West at the White House in Washington, U.S., September 5, 2019.

The ruling by Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia brings an end to a six-week antitrust trial in which U.S. regulators argued that the $85 billion deal would give AT&T undue leverage against rival cable providers that relied on Time Warner\u2019s content.  The judge\u2019s approval, and scathing opinion that urged the government not to oppose the ruling, will give telecommunications providers the confidence that similar types of acquisitions will also have a shot at clearing regulatory hurdles, and could spur other copycat mergers this year, industry analysts and dealmakers said.  AT&T said that controlling Time Warner\u2019s cable brands will help it craft new types of content to retain its customers as web-based rivals like Netflix Inc woo audiences away from traditional pay-TV subscriptions.  For cable companies feeling the pain of cord-cutting, similar deals for coveted media brands could help them build out new content offerings and offset expected declines in revenues, analysts and dealmakers told Reuters.  The Justice Department had argued that AT&T\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner would allow it to charge premium prices to rivals who relied on its Turner and HBO channels to woo customers to their cable plans, potentially giving it an unfair advantage in the pay-TV market. Now this will be a less of a concern for companies.  \u201cThis decision could serve as a \u2018green light\u2019 for other potential M&A, including Comcast\u2019s ongoing pursuit of FOX,\u201d said John Hodulik, an analyst at UBS, in a note.  Regulators will still likely scrutinize similar deals, and there is no guarantee that the district court\u2019s approval of AT&T\u2019s merger with Time Warner means that other major media acquisitions would be approved, several antitrust attorneys told Reuters.  Still, at least one company, Comcast, the largest U.S. cable provider, had been waiting for the court decision before making any large M&A moves in media, sources have said.  Rival cable company Comcast is now likely to go ahead with its planned attempt to woo Twenty-First Century Fox Inc away from Walt Disney Co, which said it would acquire most assets of the media company for around $50 billion last year.  \u201cRegardless of what happens on the appeal front, expect Comcast to put forth an all-cash bid in the next day or so at a premium to Disney,\u201d said Mary Ann Halford, senior adviser to OC&C Strategy Consultants.  Comcast is aiming to gain control over Fox assets such as its Twentieth Century Fox Film and TV studios, which includes brands ranging from X-Men to The Simpsons, as well many of its cable networks.  The court ruling could also open the door for Verizon, AT&T\u2019S main rival, to bid for a media company, UBS\u2019 Hodulik added.  However, in Verizon\u2019s most recent quarterly earnings call, executives said they would rather sit out the current consolidation, and instead build out its content offerings through partnerships with independent media companies.  It also appointed a new chief executive officer earlier this month, Hans Vestberg, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, in a move that signaled Verizon would likely double down on its existing telecommunications business.  Still, one potential target for Verizon would be a combined CBS Corp and Viacom Inc, analysts have said, assuming that on ongoing legal battle between CBS\u2019s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, and the company\u2019s board, is resolved.  In a recent court filing, Redstone said her long-term plan was to create a combined company, which would unite media assets including CBS\u2019 broadcast networks, Showtime, MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, and then sell it. Halford, from OC&C added, \u201cAll I know is that this will be a blockbuster summer for media mergers!\u201d","131":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump targeted AT&T on Monday, urging customers to drop the telecommunications company over its ownership of cable news network CNN in the latest salvo in his long-running criticism over its news coverage.

T-Mobile and Sprint are also part of the organization.  Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint did not respond to requests for comment. AT&T declined comment.

The merger, which was announced in October 2016 and closed on June 14, was opposed by President Donald Trump. The merged company includes CNN, the cable news station that is a frequent target of Trump\u2019s ire. The Justice Department has asked a federal appeals court to reverse a lower court\u2019s approval of the deal.  In the court filing, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim denied that the government\u2019s lawsuit was motivated by animus toward CNN.

According to the filing, Delrahim said the exchange with the Time Warner general counsel, Paul Cappuccio, occurred during a Nov. 8, 2017, meeting that included the company\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey Bewkes, and Time Warner board member William Barr, a former U.S. attorney general.  Delrahim said that Cappuccio stood up, \u201cwagged his finger at me, and said that if the Antitrust Division goes through with this, the case will be \u2018a sh*tshow like you\u2019ve never seen,\u2019 and that it would be like \u2018Jimmy Hoffa and the firing of Jim Comey,\u2019\u201d referring to the missing former Teamsters president and the former FBI director fired by Trump.  \u201cI interpreted Mr. Cappuccio\u2019s comments to mean that if we brought this enforcement action, defendants would employ personal attacks to denigrate the integrity of the Antitrust Division and myself,\u201d he added.

He added: \u201cNo reasonable person could have misinterpreted Mr. Cappuccio\u2019s comments as a threat that the companies would personally attack Mr. Delrahim or anyone else in the event of litigation.\u201d  Barr said Cappuccio was suggesting instead that the government\u2019s challenge of the deal would cause a \u201cpublic political and media frenzy\u201d because of Trump\u2019s animus toward CNN.  Cappuccio could not immediately be reached, but AT&T said in a statement on Thursday that \u201cour opinion of the government\u2019s lawsuit is no secret\u201d and that the company appreciated \u201cBarr stepping forward to provide his first-hand account of DOJ\u2019s interactions with us.\u201d  The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

An AT&T logo is pictured in Pasadena, California, U.S., January 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni\/File Photo  In the brief for its appeal to the U.S. District Court decision in June, the government also argued the court should have concluded that the merger would give Time Warner more clout at the bargaining table.  Judge Richard Leon ruled in June that the Justice Department was wrong to ask that the $85.4 billion merger be blocked. The government had said it would lead to higher prices for consumers and was illegal under antitrust law.  In writing that ruling, Leon, the government said in its brief, ignored evidence regarding how companies use leverage to bargain with each other and failed to take into account corporate efforts to increase their revenues.  The court\u2019s errors \u201ccolored the court\u2019s view of the facts, leading to a decision that is clearly erroneous in light of the evidence presented at trial,\u201d the Justice Department said.  The core of the Justice Department\u2019s concern about the deal is that AT&T, which owns DirecTV, would use its ownership of Time Warner\u2019s content to make pay TV rivals pay more, thus raising their costs and forcing them to charge consumers more.  \u201cThe district court erroneously concluded that the merger will not give Time Warner any increased bargaining leverage. The reasons the district court gave for finding zero increase in leverage are implausible and internally inconsistent,\u201d the government said in its brief.  AT&T\u2019s General Counsel David McAtee disagreed with the Justice Department\u2019s assessment, saying that the government\u2019s case had \u201cmany holes.\u201d  \u201cAppeals aren\u2019t \u2018do-overs.\u2019 There is nothing in DOJ\u2019s brief today that should disturb that decision,\u201d he said, using the acronym for the Department of Justice.  The Justice Department has appealed but no date has been set for when the appeals court will hear the case. The deal closed on June 14.  AT&T has said it would manage Time Warner\u2019s Turner cable television networks as part of a separate business unit until February 2019 or the conclusion of the government\u2019s appeal.  The merger, announced in October 2016, was opposed by President Donald Trump.

A spokesman for AT&T declined to comment. Lesser was not immediately reachable.  Lesser had interviewed for the CEO role at WarnerMedia, AT&T\u2019s media unit, but received an indication that he would not be selected, the source said.  A replacement at Xandr is not yet known.  AT&T has spent a combined $134 billion to buy satellite TV provider DirecTV and media company Time Warner to take on Netflix Inc and then craft a digital and TV advertising strategy that would make use of the combined companies\u2019 assets.  The company launched Xandr in 2018 to offer partners a better way to target ads to consumers using data collected from phone, internet and TV services.  Lesser felt comfortable stepping down because Xandr is in a good position and its first quarter results are expected to show significant growth, the source said.  A long-time advertising executive, Lesser joined AT&T in 2017 and was previously CEO of ad agency GroupM North America. Lesser also founded Xaxis, an ad technology company.  At Xandr, he oversaw the purchase of ad tech companies AppNexus and clypd to give Xandr the technical capabilities of selling digital and TV ads.  However, ad agency executives who spoke with Reuters earlier this year have viewed Xandr\u2019s progress as slow, citing few new product offerings for advertisers since its launch.  A spokeswoman for Xandr did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  News of Lesser\u2019s resignation came on the same day the company announced a move toward its long-stated goal of changing how TV ads are purchased.  On Wednesday, Xandr launched a TV ad-buying tool in partnership with Walt Disney Co, AMC Networks and WarnerMedia that would allow advertisers to target certain viewers across the networks using AT&T data.  One ad agency executive who did not want to be named said the timing of Lesser\u2019s resignation was a surprise. The executive added that clients would be advised against using Xandr\u2019s new ad buying tool until there was more clarity surrounding the company\u2019s technology strategy.","147":"March 19 (Reuters) - Viacom Inc said on Tuesday it has begun warning viewers that its channels could go dark on AT&T Inc-owned DirecTV if it fails to reach a new contract by midnight March 22.

Speaking on CNBC, Stephenson said the original court decision was well reasoned.  \u201cAt the end of the day the law was on our side,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think the likelihood of this thing being reversed or overturned is really remote.\u201d  The merger, first announced in October 2016, was opposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. AT&T was sued by the Justice Department on antitrust grounds but Judge Richard Leon concluded the government failed to show that prices would go up and allowed the deal to go forward.  Credit rating agency Fitch said in a statement it believed the original decision will be upheld, but acknowledged the three-judge appeals court panel could disagree. Moody\u2019s said in a statement AT&T\u2019s credit ratings remain unchanged.  Raymond James analyst Frank Louthan downgraded AT&T from outperform to market perform on news of the planned appeal, saying it is a \u201cnegative catalyst for the stock.\u201d  \u201cThis is a significant overhang for an extended period and is not conducive to share price appreciation,\u201d he wrote.  Approval of the Time Warner deal last month triggered further moves in a bidding war between Comcast Corp and Walt Disney Co over the bulk of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc\u2019s film and TV assets. Disney has received U.S. antitrust approval for the purchase.  Stephenson told CNBC the dispute could hurt Comcast\u2019s chances of prevailing. Comcast is a major cable provider while AT&T owns satellite giant DirecTV.  \u201cIt does affect that process. You\u2019re in a situation where two entities are bidding for an asset and this kind of action can affect the outcome,\u201d he said.

An AT&T logo is pictured in Pasadena, California, U.S., January 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni  The second-largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers has turned its focus to paying down debt after spending $85 billion to buy media company Time Warner. It has also pulled back on promotional pricing for phone and television plans, sacrificing new customer gains.  \u201cI would say we\u2019re ahead of schedule in each of our key priorities,\u201d said AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson during a call with analysts.  The company\u2019s debt was $171 billion at the end of 2018, after paying off some $9 billion since the Time Warner merger closed in June.  In communications, AT&T\u2019s largest business, the carrier gained a net 134,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill, falling far short of analysts\u2019 estimates of 208,000, according to research firm FactSet. AT&T has 153 million total phone subscribers.  Churn, or the rate of customer defections, was 1 percent during the fourth quarter, up from 0.89 percent the previous year.  AT&T has had a relatively \u201cburdened\u201d wireless network, which can lead to slower data speeds, while smaller rival T-Mobile US Inc has been rapidly expanding its network capacity, contributing to the higher churn, said Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with New Street Research.  AT&T\u2019s entertainment segment, which includes satellite TV provider DirecTV, has been in continuous decline. It lost more subscribers during the quarter as viewers shifted to cheaper streaming services, just not those owned by AT&T.  DirecTV Now, AT&T\u2019s streaming service, lost 267,000 subscribers, more than analysts expected, which the company blamed on customers leaving once discounted introductory offers ran out.  DirecTV lost 403,000 satellite TV subscribers, more than the estimate of 328,000 customer losses, according to research firm FactSet.  Analysts had been closely watching the entertainment segment\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) after AT&T had committed to stabilizing the decline.  But entertainment EBITDA fell by 15.6 percent during the quarter. That illustrated \u201cjust how steep the climb\u201d will be to reach stability, said Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson, in a note.  AT&T\u2019s investors may be expecting the company to eventually cut its 7 percent dividend yield, shown by AT&T\u2019s falling stock price over time, Moffett said.  The new WarnerMedia segment, which includes Turner and premium TV channel HBO, reported quarterly revenue of $9.23 billion, beating estimates of $9.05 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  AT&T\u2019s total revenue rose 15.2 percent to $47.99 billion but missed analysts\u2019 estimates of $48.5 billion.  Net income attributable to AT&T fell to $4.86 billion, or 66 cents per share, from $19.04 billion, or $3.08 per share, a year earlier, when the company had a big one-time benefit from the U.S. tax overhaul.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  John Hauser, who teaches marketing, was the fourth witness to be called by the U.S. Justice Department in its lawsuit to block telecommunications company AT&T\u2019s T.N $85 billion deal to buy Time Warner.  The U.S. government opposes the deal, arguing that it would hurt consumers because AT&T, which owns pay TV service DirecTV, would have more leverage to raise prices by owning Time Warner\u2019s Turner networks.  Hauser\u2019s findings are important to the Department of Justice\u2019s case because his data shows that AT&T, once it owns Time Warner, could hurt rivals to the point of perhaps costing them 12 percent of their subscribers by withholding Time Warner in the event of a price dispute.  But Greg Rigdon, executive vice president of content acquisition for Comcast Corp CMCSA.O, seemed skeptical of that figure when pressed to compare data on how many subscribers a company would expect to lose if they dropped a channel, called \"drop analyses,\" with real world data.  \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a major drop-off for 12 months,\u201d he said, while noting that he had never experienced the loss of major content like Turner\u2019s family of channels.  Rigdon also noted that he did not expect AT&T\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner to affect Comcast. \u201cI don\u2019t have any reason to believe that it will impact my relations with Turner,\u201d he said.  In cross-examination of Hauser, Peter Barbur noted that Warren Schlichting, group president of Dish\u2019s Sling TV, testified on Tuesday that 30,000, or 0.25 percent, of its subscribers dropped Dish when Turner programming went dark for about a month in 2014.  Barbur, who represents Time Warner, also said that Cable One provided testimony that it lost less than 1 percent of subscribers when Turner\u2019s networks went down for about a month in 2013.  \u201cInstead of looking at real world data on blackouts, you were retained to do a survey,\u201d Barbur said.  Hauser said that without knowing the entire scenario of those situations, it was hard to say why the results differed from his findings. \u201cI believe my numbers are accurate,\u201d he said.

Trump has lambasted both outlets frequently for their critical coverage of him.  \u201cIt is very squarely within our responsibility to find out,\u201d Schiff told Axios in an interview that will air Sunday on HBO.  Schiff said Trump \u201cwas secretly meeting with the postmaster (general) in an effort to browbeat the postmaster into raising postal rates on Amazon... This appears to be an effort by the president to use the instruments of state power to punish Jeff Bezos and the Washington Post,\u201d Schiff said.  It is not clear what committees may probe the corporate issues, since Schiff\u2019s Intelligence Committee would not have oversight. A Schiff spokesman declined further comment.  AT&T and Amazon.com both declined to comment on Sunday. The White House did not immediately comment.  Trump has repeatedly complained Amazon does not pay the U.S. Postal Service a fair rate for package delivery. Trump has said, without citing evidence, that this costs U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars, and he has threatened to raise the company\u2019s postal rates.  Trump opposed the AT&T-Time Warner merger as a candidate and has repeatedly attacked CNN and last week a CNN reporter\u2019s White House press pass was suspended.  The Justice Department is appealing a federal judge\u2019s approval of the $85.4 billion AT&T acquisition of Time Warner.  With a split decision in last week\u2019s congressional elections, Democrats plan a cautious approach. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi told CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that Democrats will not conduct \u201cany investigation for a political purpose, but to seek the truth.\u201d  Cummings vowed a \u201cmethodical\u201d approach in approaching investigations. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be handing out subpoenas like somebody\u2019s handing out candy on Halloween,\u201d Cummings said.","161":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department squared off on Thursday with AT&T Inc in a long anticipated trial, as the two sides disputed whether AT&T\u2019s $85 billion purchase of Time Warner Inc would be good for consumers or an expensive drag on innovation.  During opening statements, Justice Department lawyer Craig Conrath asked for the deal to be blocked, saying it would hike prices for consumers by more than $400 million annually, or an average of $0.45 a month for pay TV subscribers, by making rival pay TV companies pay more for Time Warner content.  \u201cTime Warner would be a weapon for AT&T because AT&T\u2019s competitors need Time Warner,\u201d Conrath told U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, who will decide the case after a trial expected to last six to eight weeks.  Conrath also said AT&T would be able to use content from movie and TV show maker Time Warner, including its Turner unit, to slow innovation in online video.  In opening remarks, Daniel Petrocelli, speaking for AT&T and Time Warner, ridiculed the Justice Department\u2019s case and suggested the government was \u201cfundamentally stuck in the past\u201d with arguments that were \u201cdivorced from reality.\u201d  Petrocelli said the deal would actually lead to a 50-cent decrease in prices for pay TV subscribers, citing what he said were errors in a government expert\u2019s model of how the transaction would impact future prices.  The Justice Department, Petrocelli said, \u201ccannot meet their burden of proof. They cannot prove that this would lessen competition.\u201d  The merger is about the companies trying to better compete with technology businesses like Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc, Petrocelli said.  The internet companies, including Netflix Inc, pose two challenges to pay TV. They either compete with cable and satellite television for ad dollars or provide cheaper online video that has hurt pricey pay-TV. Some do both.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Petrocelli added that the combined company would be better at using customer data to target advertising. Companies like General Motors Co and Mastercard In will pay more for higher quality advertising and consumers will pay less, he said.  The Justice Department filed suit in November to stop AT&T, which has some 25 million pay-TV subscribers, from closing the deal. AT&T says a merger would benefit consumers by creating efficiencies. AT&T is the biggest pay-TV provider via subsidiary DirecTV.  Conrath suggested that AT&T would be able to hike fees that Turner charges for its content by about 10 percent if the merger were approved and that the company could withhold content from rival distributors. He referenced an internal email from Turner executives that Dish Network Corp\u2019s Sling service would be \u201ccrap\u201d without Turner content, as he paraphrased the stronger language in the email.  President Donald Trump publicly criticized the deal as a candidate and as president, and the Republican president often has excoriated Time Warner\u2019s CNN news network.  For its first witness, the Justice Department called Cox Communications content buyer Suzanne Fenwick, who described Time Warner\u2019s movies, television shows and sports programming as \u201cmust-have content\u201d for the cable TV provider.  If the merger went through, she said, she feared the next negotiation. \u201cWe\u2019re very concerned that we\u2019re going to be presented with a horribly ugly deal,\u201d she said.  Petrocelli, in response, pressed her in vain to show any analytics to prove that Cox needed Time Warner to prevent customers from moving to DirecTV. \u201cYou\u2019ve never done a single bit of quantitative analysis,\u201d he concluded.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  GOVERNMENT LOSS MEANS MORE DEALS  If the government loses, that could open up the field for more tie-ups between distributors and content providers. But a win could strengthen the hand of antitrust regulators looking at other, similarly structured mergers.  AT&T and Time Warner are not direct competitors, making the deal a so-called vertical merger between companies on the same supply chain. The vast majority of challenged mergers involve one rival buying another.  The merger would hand AT&T, if it becomes the new owner of Time Warner, the motive and opportunity to refuse to license March Madness NCAA basketball tournament games, along with premium cable channel HBO and other content, to pay-TV rivals and online distributors, the Justice Department has said.  Petrocelli had asked for access to communications between the White House and Justice Department about the deal, but the judge denied the request. Trump\u2019s opposition to the merger did not come up during opening statements.  If the government loses, Verizon Communications Inc and Charter Communications Inc could strike deals to buy movie or television makers and squeeze smaller pay-TV providers.  AT&T has said the merger would result in more than $2.5 billion in annual cost savings by 2020.","162":"Oct 22 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc on Thursday reported the coronavirus pandemic had taken a heavy toll on its media business, but quarterly results were offset by stronger than expected gains in new phone subscribers lifted by offers for its HBO Max streaming service for free on certain phone plans.  That helped AT&T beat revenue expectations. Total revenue was $42.3 billion during the third quarter ended Sept. 30, exceeding the average analyst expectation of $41.59 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The company added 645,000 net new phone subscribers during the quarter who pay a recurring monthly bill. Analysts had expected AT&T to lose a net 9,000 customers, according to research firm FactSet.  Adjusted earnings per share were 76 cents, down from 94 cents in the same quarter last year.  AT&T said the pandemic eroded earnings per share by 21 cents.  AT&T, which has spent the past few years investing to become a media business, said it had 38 million subscribers in the United States for both its premium TV channel HBO and HBO Max during the third quarter, reaching its 2021 goal a year early. It currently has 57 million subscribers worldwide.  The services had 36.3 million subscribers in the United States in the previous quarter.  Even as the WarnerMedia segment attracts new subscribers, it must also contend with existing HBO subscribers through their pay TV providers who are dumping their service.  AT&T is playing catchup to larger streaming video rivals. Netflix currently serves about 68 million U.S. customers and nearly 200 million worldwide. Walt Disney Co\u2019s Disney+ has more than 60 million subscribers, reaching its goal four years early.

Coaxial TV Cables are seen in front of AT&T and Time Warner logos in this picture illustration taken June 13, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  \u201cWhere is the clear error?\u201d U.S. Judge Judith Rogers asked Justice Department attorney Mike Murray, who called the lower court\u2019s approval of the deal \u201cmyopic.\u201d  \u201cYou have to show that there\u2019s a harm to competition,\u201d Judge David Sentelle said at another point. \u201cRemember where the burdens are,\u201d he added later.  Much of the argument at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia delved into whether a lower court judge, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, properly treated economic models of the merger\u2019s impact on future prices for pay-TV customers.  The core of the Justice Department\u2019s concern has been that AT&T, which owns DirecTV, would use ownership of Time Warner\u2019s content, such as CNN and HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d to make pay-TV rivals pay more, thus forcing them to charge consumers more.  The deal was significant for two other reasons. First, President Donald Trump, who has famously tangled with Time Warner\u2019s CNN, has vociferously opposed the deal. Second, it is a rare instance of the government seeking to stop a merger of a distributor and a supplier.  Much of the argument focused on how AT&T, which owns DirecTV, would use the threat of withholding Time Warner\u2019s Turner content, including CNN, in licensing disputes with rival pay TV companies. The government had argued that the threat of a blackout, withholding the content, would force the smaller companies to pay more, thus raising prices for consumers.  AT&T lawyer Peter Keisler cast doubt on this economic model but faced questions over an arbitration offer that AT&T made to smaller pay-TV companies, pledging that it would not black out Time Warner\u2019s Turner content for seven years. \u201cOf course, we will honor it,\u201d he said.  The Justice Department\u2019s Murray said the offer was \u201ctoo little, too late.\u201d He said the smaller pay-TV companies worried that it was inadequate to protect them.  The government is asking for the lower court case to be reversed and remanded.  The merger, which was announced in October 2016, closed on June 14 shortly after Leon ruled the deal was legal under antitrust law.  AT&T, the No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers, agreed in June to manage Time Warner\u2019s Turner networks separately from DirecTV, including setting prices and managing personnel, until February 2019 or the conclusion of the government\u2019s appeal.  The deal was seen as a turning point for a media industry that has been upended by companies like Netflix Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google which produce content and sell it online directly to consumers, without requiring a pricey cable subscription.","164":"July 19 (Reuters) - CBS Corp said on Saturday AT&T Inc has removed CBS\u2019s television stations from the channels of DIRECTV, DIRECTV NOW and AT&T U-verse TV customers.  CBS Sports Network has also been removed nationally from DIRECTV and DIRECTV NOW, the company said in a statement here.  \u201cWhile we continue to negotiate in good faith and hope that AT&T agrees to fair terms soon, this loss of CBS programming could last a long time,\u201d CBS added.

REUTERS\/Edgard Garrido  (Reuters) - AT&T Inc T.N said Friday it will again buy advertising on Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O YouTube, nearly two years after the U.S. wireless carrier left the video platform when it discovered its ads may have appeared next to inappropriate content.  AT&T is one of the largest U.S. brand marketers by total ad spend, according to research firm eMarketer, and its return caps off a tumultuous period for YouTube beginning in March 2017, when major advertisers including Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N and Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N, left the platform after their ads played during videos featuring hate speech or other disturbing material.  As brands eventually returned to YouTube, AT&T remained a major advertiser that held back.  After 22 months of working closely with Google, AT&T said it was confident \u201cthat there is a near-zero possibility\u201d its ads could end up appearing next to inappropriate or unapproved content on YouTube, Fiona Carter, AT&T\u2019s chief brand officer, said in an interview.  Increased human review of videos and improved machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) within YouTube helped AT&T decide to return, Carter said. Additionally, AT&T ran three \u201cdummy\u201d ad campaigns that used Google house ads to mimic how AT&T would run its own ad campaigns, so the company could be sure they would not unintentionally appear on videos that were counter to its corporate values.  AT&T reviews the content and topics it considers appropriate for its brand on a quarterly basis. It avoids advertising next to content that is violent or extremist, or includes hate speech and adult content, using YouTube\u2019s Brand Suitability System, a set of stricter advertising rules the platform put in place last year.  \u201cWe knew that we needed to have our hands on the wheel,\u201d Carter said, adding she was happy with how Google rose to the challenge to address brand safety on YouTube.  AT&T will begin purchasing ads over the coming weeks, though Carter declined to say how much the company expects to spend on YouTube.","166":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T T.N CEO Randall Stephenson said on Thursday his company's bid to buy movie and TV show maker Time Warner TWX.N would allow the two firms to serve customers better by lowering pay TV rates, rejecting government arguments the deal would raise consumer prices.  Chief Executive Officer of AT&T Randall Stephenson arrives at a U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., U.S. April 19, 2018. REUTERS\/Carlos Barria  Speaking in U.S. District Court in Washington, Stephenson addressed himself to Judge Richard Leon who will decide if the $85 billion deal may go forward. He said that he wanted to combine what AT&T knew about its customers with Time Warner\u2019s ability to create compelling content.  Stephenson disagreed with the government\u2019s assessment that the transaction would mean higher prices for consumers. \u201cOn its face, the premise is absurd,\u201d he said. \u201cIt literally defies logic to me.\u201d  Instead, the deal would help AT&T, which owns the biggest pay TV company DirecTV, build a cheaper online product that could be partially sustained through advertising, he said.  The government has argued that the proposed deal would spur AT&T to charge its pay TV rivals more for Time Warner content, in particular the Turner family of news and sports shows. It has also said that the combined company would have an incentive to decline to offer content to cheaper online video services in order to slow their development.  Stephenson's testimony mirrored what Time Warner TWX.N Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes said on Wednesday. He also argued the deal would help the companies better compete for advertising dollars with internet giants like Alphabet's GOOGL.O Google and Facebook FB.O.  The Justice Department introduced an email exchange between Stephenson and Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in which the pair discussed ways they could work together on advertising, but Stephenson said nothing came of the exchange.  Like Bewkes, Stephenson dismissed the idea that AT&T would seek to use Time Warner content exclusively, saying the best financial strategy was to ensure it was as widely seen as possible.  Stephenson said that AT&T had initially thought to buy several small content companies - a \u201cstring of pearls\u201d \u2013 but when that failed it decided to pursue one large company in Time Warner, a \u201chead-snapper moment.\u201d  He telephoned Bewkes to invite him to lunch, Stephenson said. \u201cA quick lunch turned into a very long afternoon,\u201d he said, as they began to discuss a deal. \u201cWe both got very excited about it.\u201d  But Stephenson also acknowledged sending an email that expressed concern that Time Warner was taking a stake in the online service Hulu, apparently concerned that it would hurt AT&T\u2019s online product.  Judge Leon asked Stephenson about AT&T\u2019s offer to go to arbitration with rival pay TV companies if they feel that they are being charged too much for Time Warner content. The arrangement is similar to one struck between the Justice Department and Comcast when it won approval to buy NBCU. Both are good for seven years.  \u201cYou modeled that on Comcast?\u201d Leon asked.  \u201cYes,\u201d Stephenson said.  Following Stephenson, the government called Ron Quintero, an accounting expert who had evaluated AT&T\u2019s estimated cost savings and revenue increases used to defend the proposed merger. Quintero said that in many of its calculations, AT&T simply estimated a percentage reduction in expenditures with no data to support it.  The trial, which began in mid-March, is expected to wrap up this month.","167":"(Reuters) - AT&T Inc T.N pulled its financial forecast for the year on Wednesday as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic clouded its view for the foreseeable future.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Although the company reported revenue and profit per share that was short of Wall Street expectations in the first quarter, a surge in new phone subscribers sent shares up 1.5% in morning trading, but fell 2% later in the day.  The U.S. telecom and media giant warned that the current quarter would demonstrate the full impact of nationwide stay-at-home mandates aimed at curbing the spread of the novel coronavirus, which only affected the company\u2019s results during the last two weeks of March.  \u201cWe\u2019re in a world where there\u2019s very little visibility in terms of what the general economic environment is going to be,\u201d Randall Stephenson, chief executive of AT&T, said on Wednesday on a conference call with analysts. \u201cWhen is America going to go back to work? That\u2019s going to roll out probably by community. It\u2019s probably going to be slower than most of us like.\u201d  The Dallas-based phone giant is the first of the big U.S. communications companies to report quarterly results, providing a glimpse into the resilience and challenges faced by the telecoms sector during the coronavirus pandemic.  AT&T said the pandemic reduced earnings by 5 cents per share in the first quarter. A severe blow to advertising sales, due to the postponement of live sports such as college basketball\u2019s March Madness and lower wireless equipment sales, led to a $600 million decline in revenue.  AT&T said it had limited visibility for the rest of the year and on its three-year strategic plan here announced in October, but added it had enough free cash flow to pay dividends and make debt payments.  To boost liquidity, the company entered into a $5.5 billion loan agreement, adding to debt that has been a point of contention for its investors. The company reported $154.3 billion in net debt as of the end of March.  In the first three months, AT&T added 163,000 net new monthly phone subscribers, beating the average Wall Street estimate of 90,700.  AT&T was able to sign up more customers despite shutting down more than 40% of its retail stores and reported 0.86% in postpaid phone churn, an improvement over last year\u2019s churn of 1.07%.  Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, warned that the first quarter was only a glimpse of the pain yet to come.  \u201cThe COVID-19 crisis slammed the brakes on the rising trend in churn,\u201d Moffett said in a report. \u201cIt is clear that the lockdown simply stopped retail activity in its tracks.\u201d  The company said that the coronavirus pandemic had a $435 million impact on EBITDA.  AT&T lost 897,000 so-called premium TV subscribers, which includes its satellite TV provider DirecTV and a small number of U-Verse users, as more consumers cut cords amid the pandemic.  WarnerMedia, which suffered the brunt of the impact from the pandemic, reported $7.4 billion in revenue, down from $8.4 billion from a year earlier. The closing of theaters and halting of production hurt its media business.  On Tuesday, Netflix Inc NFLX.O reported a surprisingly big surge in new subscribers but warned the second half of the year would be marked by slower growth as stay-at-home orders end.  AT&T is set to launch HBO Max, a subscription streaming video service and Netflix competitor on May 27.  The company reported total revenue of $42.8 billion, missing Wall Street expectations of $44.2 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen exits a hotel in New York City, U.S., April 13, 2018. REUTERS\/Jeenah Moon\/File Photo  AT&T confirmed the $200,000 payment late on Tuesday, saying it hoped to gain \u201cinsights\u201d into the new administration at a time when the telecommunications company sought approval for a major merger, among other issues.  Payments by AT&T, which could total as much as $600,000, were revealed by porn actress Stormy Daniels\u2019 lawyer, Michael Avenatti, who also said a company owned by Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg and other corporations had paid Essential Consultants for certain services.  It is not clear how Avenatti knew about the payments. His client Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has said Cohen paid her $130,000 in October 2016, a month before the election, to buy her silence about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump. Trump has denied the affair.  Avenatti\u2019s document said that AT&T paid Essential Consultants $50,000 in October, November and December of 2017, and another $50,000 in January of 2018 for a total of $200,000.  However, the contract was for a year, the source told Reuters, meaning AT&T likely paid more than $200,000 to Cohen\u2019s company. A full year contract for $50,000 per month would total $600,000. The source declined to give a total for the payments made by AT&T to Cohen\u2019s company.  Shares of AT&T were down slightly at $31.50 at 1:30 p.m. EDT on Wednesday.  While most major American corporations have a range of issues on which they lobby, AT&T has more than most. At the time of the first payment to Cohen, it had a major merger, the purchase of Time Warner for $85 billion, under review by the Justice Department. The department sued in November to stop that deal.  AT&T is also fighting the Federal Trade Commission in court over allegations that the company throttled data for online consumers who used over a certain amount, even after the company\u2019s data plan was advertised as \u201cunlimited.\u201d  Additionally, AT&T had fought net neutrality and supported tax reform.  AT&T hired Cohen when it was looking for a way to understand the new administration after seeing him on television doing interviews to advocate for Trump, the source said.  Cohen served as a long-time legal adviser to Trump in his real estate business, The Trump Corporation. During the presidential campaign, Cohen functioned as a spokesman and point-person on inquiries that related to the company in particular.  In previous interviews, Cohen described his role as a \u201cfixer\u201d for Trump who handled personal legal matters.  Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said at a press conference that the Judiciary Committee should review the payments AT&T and other companies made to Cohen.  Blumenthal said those payments \u201cmay well have been used to influence the president of the United States, using Michael Cohen and his shell company as a conduit.\u201d","169":"(Reuters) - AT&T Inc T.N said on Wednesday it would sell its wireless and wireline operations in Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands to Liberty Latin America Ltd LILA.O for $1.95 billion, as the second-largest U.S. wireless carrier cuts its huge debt pile.

AT&T purchased DirecTV for $68 billion including debt in 2015.  The company said it also took a $780 million writedown on its WarnerMedia business due to the pandemic causing shutdowns on content production and viewers staying away from cinemas.  AT&T Chief Executive John Stankey said during the earnings call with analysts that the writedown was a necessary economic move for the \u201cunfortunate set of circumstances around the pandemic.\u201d  The writedowns partially eclipsed good news from the company\u2019s core wireless business, which added almost twice as many phone subscribers than Wall Street had expected.  During the fourth quarter, AT&T added 800,000 net new phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill, beating analyst expectations of 475,300 customers, according to research firm FactSet.

AT&T said it now has 41.5 million U.S. subscribers for both its premium TV channel HBO and streaming service HBO Max in the fourth quarter, up from 38 million the previous quarter.  Total operating revenue was $45.69 billion, beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $44.56 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Shares of AT&T were down less than 1% at $29.48 in morning trading.","173":"(Reuters) - AT&T Inc on Monday unveiled a three-year strategic plan that included selling up to $10 billion worth of businesses next year, paying off all its debt from the purchase of Time Warner and adding two new board members, bowing to pressure from activist investor Elliott Management.  The second-largest U.S. wireless phone carrier by subscribers has struggled with a stagnant stock price despite having spent billions on a bet that owning media content, as well as all the ways that people can access it through their phones, TVs and the internet, would pay off.  The result of that wager, AT&T\u2019s HBO Max subscription streaming video service, will be unveiled on Tuesday in Burbank, Calif.  AT&T\u2019s heavy debt load and declining revenue from segments like satellite TV provider DirecTV caught the attention of Elliott, one of the industry\u2019s most powerful activist investors, which bought a $3.2 billion stake earlier this year.  The New York-based hedge fund, which invests $38 billion, last month criticized Dallas-based AT&T, which has market capitalization of $283 billion, for its acquisitions, bloated costs and leadership structure. It asked the company to stop buying more companies, review its portfolio and costs and add new board members, laying the groundwork for an attack on one of the biggest corporate targets ever.  By Monday, about seven weeks after Elliott made its suggestions, AT&T committed to buying back stock, adding two new directors and reviewing its portfolio.  There are \u201cno sacred cows\u201d when it comes to reviewing the business portfolio, long-serving CEO Randall Stephenson told analysts. While Stephenson had planned to retire soon, he pledged to stay through 2020 and oversee the changes himself.  While DirecTV will be an important piece of AT&T\u2019s strategy over the next three years, AT&T will consider multiple options, including partnerships and other structures, Stephenson said.  AT&T shares were up 4.8% to $38.70 in midday trading.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Stephenson took control of the negotiations with Elliott, with the two sides meeting in New York and Dallas and often by phone to reach Monday\u2019s announcement, a person familiar with the talks said.  Elliott got almost everything it asked for but made no commitments that prohibit it from exerting further pressure on the company, an unusual outcome in activist fights.  In a sign the two sides had quickly found common ground, Stephenson told Reuters on Monday that a standstill agreement, which could have prevented Elliott from taking further action, did not come up.  Publicly, Elliott was keeping a low profile, commending the company but saying nothing beyond its statement.  As a first step, AT&T plans to name a new board member with expertise in technology and cost cutting soon, Stephenson said on an analyst call in which he also had warm words for the hedge fund.  A second board member will be named next year and will have media credentials, the person familiar with the matter said, adding that both sides are still reviewing possible candidates.  To reduce its debt of $153.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, AT&T has been on a selling spree. Over the weekend, it sold Central European Media Enterprises Ltd (CME) to investment group PPF in a cash deal valued at about $2.1 billion.  The company expects to generate $14 billion through asset sales and other initiatives by the end of this year. It has reduced its net debt by $12.7 billion so far this year.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  WEAK RESULTS  Monday\u2019s announcement presented an \u201cawkward conundrum\u201d as AT&T issued financial guidance through 2022 that was ahead of Wall Street\u2019s consensus, though its quarterly results fell short of expectations in every segment, Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with New Street Research, said in a note.  AT&T lost 1.2 million premium TV customers, which includes DirecTV, as well as 195,000 streaming video customers, as it has sought to roll off subscribers who had signed up with price promotions.  Revenue from WarnerMedia was down 4.4% from the previous year to $7.8 billion as it made less money from the Warner Bros. movie studio.  Total operating revenue in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 fell to $44.59 billion from $45.74 billion a year earlier, missing analyst expectations of $45 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv..  Excluding items, AT&T earned 94 cents per share, above analysts\u2019 estimates of 93 cents.  The carrier added 101,000 net new phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill during the third quarter. Wall Street estimated it would gain 61,000 net new customer additions, according to a note from Cowen analysts.","174":"(Reuters) - Data platform company InfoSum announced on Tuesday it has raised $15.1 million in its Series A funding round, and that Brian Lesser, former chief executive of AT&T Inc's T.N advertising unit Xandr, has been named executive chairman.  InfoSum, based in the UK, provides technology that allows advertisers, ad agencies and media companies to work together on advertising campaigns without needing to share sensitive consumer data.  The new funding comes at a time when concerns about the use of data are widespread and laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act have been passed to protect data privacy.  Advertisers, which buy ad space, and media companies, sellers of ad space, have traditionally had to send their data to a third party, which would analyze and return the results. Advertisers could then see if potential buyers of their product were audiences of that media company, Nick Halstead, chief executive and founder of InfoSum, said in an interview.  But transferring data to a third party is an \u201carchaic\u201d system \u201cfraught with issues from a compliance standpoint,\u201d Lesser said in an interview.  Lesser previously oversaw Xandr, which was built to help advertisers better target consumers using AT&T phone, internet and TV data, before stepping down in March. He joined InfoSum\u2019s board in April.  If both the advertiser and media company use InfoSum, they can create a \u201cbunker\u201d within their data systems, and InfoSum\u2019s technology would match the data without it ever leaving the owner\u2019s control, Lesser said. That will help both brands and even traditional TV companies, which are increasingly making use of consumer data, he added.  \u201cBrands show up to a transaction knowing precisely who they want to advertise to,\u201d Lesser said.  The investment round was led by venture capital firms Upfront Ventures and IA Ventures. Xandr and UK media company ITV, both of which use InfoSum\u2019s technology, are among the strategic partners.","175":"(Reuters) - AT&T Inc\u2019s advertising unit Xandr on Monday launched an ad-buying platform called Xandr Invest to lure advertisers with exclusive access to AT&T customer data and streamline how companies can buy ad space across different formats such as streaming video and mobile.  The platform is AT&T\u2019s latest move to combine the pieces of two different acquisitions - media company Time Warner and ad technology company AppNexus - to evolve beyond a wireless phone carrier.  Like other companies with advertising ambitions, AT&T will have stiff competition from Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Facebook, which together commanded nearly 60% of the U.S. internet advertising market in 2018, according to a report last week from consultancy PwC. AT&T had single-digit market share last year, PwC said.  Xandr Invest will let advertisers buy ads on premium and brand safe content on AT&T-owned properties such as TV networks CNN, TBS and TNT. It also will be the only ad-buying platform for Community, Xandr\u2019s premium video marketplace that also curates content from outside publishers like Vice and Tubi.  Ads on traditional live television will not be available on Xandr Invest at the launch and will be added over time, said Suzanne O\u2019Kelley, Xandr vice president of product for buyers. Those ads will continue to be sold by a sales team, she said.  \u201cAs advertising becomes more dependent on technology, bringing more ways to buy is a big part of our mission,\u201d O\u2019Kelley said in an interview.  As it transforms into a media and advertising company, AT&T has publicized it has 170 million direct customer relationships through its wireless phones and satellite TV business DirecTV, and the anonymized data can help advertisers better target their ads. That data now is available exclusively through Xandr Invest, the company said.  Xandr Invest also includes an offering called programmatic guaranteed, which will allow advertisers to reserve ads on premium content that may have limited supply.  As traditional live TV is added to Xandr Invest, it will eventually allow advertisers to buy live TV ads upfront through the ad-buying platform without going through a direct sales team, O\u2019Kelley said.","176":"(Reuters) - The White House has told two U.S. House Democrats it will not turn over documents that could show whether Republican President Donald Trump sought to intervene in the regulatory review of AT&T Inc\u2019s $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc.  FILE PHOTO: Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) speaks to the media as he arrives on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., December 7, 2018. REUTERS\/Joshua Roberts\/File Photo  In March, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler and Representative David Cicilline, who chairs a panel overseeing antitrust issues, asked the White House and Justice Department to turn over records after The New Yorker magazine reported Trump directed then-National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn to use the Justice Department to block the deal.  The pair wrote that if accurate, Trump\u2019s involvement would \u201cconstitute a grave abuse of power.\u201d In February, a federal appeals court upheld a lower-court ruling rejecting a Justice Department challenge to the deal filed in November 2017.  Trump criticized the deal as a candidate in late 2016, saying it would concentrate too much media power in the hands of one owner, and later saying it would raise prices. He has also frequently attacked CNN, a Time Warner property now owned by AT&T, for what he sees as negative coverage of his campaign and administration.  In a letter dated Monday and released on Tuesday by Cicilline, White House counsel Pat Cipollone declined to release any documents, saying he would not provide \u201cprotected communications between the president and his senior advisers that are the very core of the executive branch\u2019s confidentiality interests.\u201d  Cipollone added that the Justice Department would be responding \u201cin due course.\u201d  The two Democrats responded in a joint statement that \u201cthe White House Counsel has made a blanket claim that all White House communications \u2014 regardless of whether they contain evidence of improper or even unlawful activities \u2014 are protected by a cone of secrecy,\u201d adding they would \u201cpursue this matter.\u201d  Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, said in a 2018 declaration he had never received \u201corders, instructions, or directions relating\u201d to the AT&T-Time Warner deal from Trump, Justice Department officials or White House officials.  The Justice Department said in February it would not seek further appeals to block the merger.  In February 2018, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon rejected AT&T\u2019s request to see White House communications that might shed light on whether Trump pressured the Justice Department to try to block the deal.  AT&T lawyers said last year the deal may have been singled out for enforcement, citing as evidence statements by Trump as a candidate and as president that the deal was bad for consumers and the country.

FILE PHOTO: Smartphone with AT&T logo is seen in front of displayed Time Warner logo in this picture illustration taken June 13, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  The department said last Thursday that it would appeal a federal judge\u2019s approval of the $85.4 billion acquisition.  AT&T, which owns pay-TV company DirecTV, said it did not oppose the expedited schedule.  The Justice Department filing seeks briefs to be completed by Oct. 18, with oral arguments \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d That would be a significantly faster-than-normal timetable for an appeals court to hear a case.  \u201cIn approving the merger, the district court rejected fundamental principles of economics, creating uncertainty that will have an outsized effect on vertical merger analysis,\u201d the Justice Department said in its filing. A vertical transaction is when a company merges with a supplier.  \u201cThe United States therefore brings this appeal and seeks a swift correction of the district court\u2019s errors,\u201d the filing said.  AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said last week that the company would win the appeal: \u201cWe think the likelihood of this thing being reversed or overturned is really remote.\u201d  The Justice Department sued AT&T in November, asking a court to stop its purchase of Time Warner, saying the deal would lead to higher prices for consumers. The merger, announced in October 2016, was also opposed by President Donald Trump.  But U.S. District Judge Richard Leon said last month it was legal and allowed it to move forward. The merger closed on June 14.  After the ruling, the Justice Department did not attempt to prevent the companies from closing the merger in June after AT&T said in a letter that it would manage Time Warner\u2019s Turner cable television networks as part of a separate business unit until either February 2019 or the conclusion of the government\u2019s appeal.  Since winning in court, AT&T has raised the price for wireless customers with some unlimited data plans by $5 a month and informed customers it was increasing the price of its internet streaming service, DirecTV Now, by $5 a month.","179":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T Inc sought to persuade a judge on Monday to throw out evidence the government seeks to use in a trial that begins this week to show that the company\u2019s $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc would harm consumers and competitors.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The Justice Department filed a lawsuit in November to stop the U.S. No. 2 wireless carrier, which owns DirecTV and other services with 25 million subscribers, from buying movie and TV show maker Time Warner, which owns HBO and CNN. Opening arguments in the trial, which could shape the future of U.S. media ownership, are set for Wednesday before Judge Richard Leon in Washington.  On Monday, Daniel Petrocelli, the lawyer for AT&T, argued that many exhibits that the government planned to bring should be rejected either because they were irrelevant or because the person writing them was not a decision-maker.  Petrocelli objected, for example, to a document from DirecTV that was written before it was acquired by AT&T that warned of the dangers of higher prices because of a previous media merger. The Justice Department\u2019s Eric Welsh defended the decision to present it. \u201cThey are also a market participant,\u201d he said.  Welsh also indicated that an official from Google\u2019s YouTube could testify on the importance of the Turner channel to DirecTV\u2019s rivals, which would help show AT&T\u2019s future ability to raise prices.  AT&T rejected settlement offers from the Justice Department, including government proposals to shed either its DirecTV division or Time Warner\u2019s Turner Broadcasting assets, which include CNN.  The government has argued that the deal could allow a more powerful AT&T to raise prices for pay TV rivals and subscribers while hampering the development of online video. They estimate it will hike a subscriber\u2019s monthly cable bill by 45 cents.  AT&T denies that prices would rise and plans to argue the deal is necessary for it to compete with media companies like Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Netflix Inc, according to court documents filed before the trial.  AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson, Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes and programming executives from rival companies are expected to testify during the trial that the judge has estimated would last six to eight weeks.  Looming over the trial is the question of whether U.S. President Donald Trump, who criticized the deal on the campaign trail and again as president, may have influenced the Justice Department\u2019s decision to oppose the transaction.  AT&T lawyers have said the Time Warner deal may have been singled out for enforcement, citing Trump\u2019s statements that the deal was bad for consumers and the country.  Leon last month rejected a bid by AT&T to force the government to disclose any White House communications that AT&T lawyers believe may have shed light on the matter. AT&T did not raise any arguments relating to Trump in its final pretrial brief filed earlier this month.  The outcome of the AT&T\/Time Warner case could affect other pending \u201cvertical\u201d mergers, in which different parts of a supply chain, rather than rivals in the same business, join together.

Stankey will take over on July 1. Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s current CEO, said Friday he will retire, but will serve as executive chairman of the board until January 2021.

New York-based activist investor Elliott Management called for a shake-up at AT&T last fall, urging the company to end its buying spree and improve its operating businesses. The hedge fund also questioned Stankey\u2019s leadership skills and AT&T\u2019s desire to promote him into the top role.  By late October, AT&T had unveiled a three-year plan that included selling up to $10 billion worth of businesses, paying off debt and adding two new board members.  Elliott said Friday it supports Stankey\u2019s appointment to CEO.  \u201cWe have been engaged with the company throughout the search process, which was a robust one, including a range of highly qualified outside candidates and overseen by independent directors,\u201d said Jesse Cohen, a partner at Elliott Management. \u201cWe look forward to working with John as he begins his term as CEO.\u201d  \u201cMy commitment is, you\u2019ll get my best from me every day,\u201d Stankey said.

Speaking in U.S. District Court in Washington, Stephenson addressed himself to Judge Richard Leon who will decide if the $85 billion deal may go forward. He said that he wanted to combine what AT&T knew about its customers with Time Warner\u2019s ability to create compelling content.  This would help AT&T, which owns the biggest pay TV company DirecTV, build a cheaper online product that could be partially sustained through advertising, he said.  The Justice Department has sued to block the $84.5 billion deal, saying it would hurt competition.  Stephenson\u2019s testimony mirrors what Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes said on Wednesday. He also argued the deal would help the companies better compete for ad dollars with internet giants like Alphabet\u2019s Google and Facebook.  Like Bewkes, Stephenson dismissed the idea that AT&T would seek to use Time Warner content exclusively, saying the best financial strategy was to ensure it was as widely seen as possible.  Stephenson said that AT&T had initially thought to buy several small content companies - a \u201cstring of pearls\u201d \u2013 but when that failed it decided to pursue one large company in Time Warner, a \u201chead-snapper moment.\u201d  He telephoned Bewkes to invite him to lunch, Stephenson said. \u201cA quick lunch turned into a very long afternoon,\u201d he said, as they began to discuss a deal. \u201cWe both got very excited about it.\u201d  Under questioning by Daniel Petrocelli, a lawyer for AT&T, Stephenson sought to blunt some evidence that the Justice Department would likely bring up.  AT&T has argued that the deal would produce synergies, or reduced costs, that would balance out lost competition. Petrocelli showed Stephenson a document where he said the potential deal had \u201cno significant cost synergies\u201d and asked him to explain.  Stephenson said the document reflected a preliminary assessment and was incorrect. Dennis Carlton, from the University of Chicago, testified earlier in the trial that the deal would provide a net benefit to consumers of 52 cents per pay TV subscriber a month.  The government has argued that the proposed deal would spur AT&T to charge its pay TV rivals more for Time Warner content, in particular the Turner family of news and sports shows. It has also said that the combined company would have an incentive to decline to offer content to cheaper online video services in order to slow their development.  The trial, which began in mid-March , is expected to wrap up this month.

An AT&T spokesman said in an email: \u201cAlong with other GSMA members, we have provided information to the government in response to their requests and will continue to work proactively within GSMA, including with those who might disagree with the proposed standards.\u201d  News of the probe comes at a critical time for AT&T which is being sued by the Justice Department to stop its deal to buy media company Time Warner Inc.  The U.S. government has argued in a trial that is nearing completion that the proposed deal would spur AT&T to charge its pay TV rivals more for Time Warner content.  However, Judge Richard Leon, who will decide if AT&T will be allowed to buy Time Warner, is unlikely to consider a report of potential wrongdoing by the wireless giant because it is irrelevant to the merger trial under way in Washington, said Seth Bloom, a veteran of the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division.  The Department of Justice and the GSMA, the telecommunications standard setting group, declined to comment on news of the investigation.  Shares of AT&T and Verizon dipped after the initial Times report, with AT&T closing down 0.4 percent at $34.67, and Verizon ending off 1.1 percent, at $47.90.  The person briefed on the matter told Reuters that other wireless operators potentially received inquiries from the government.  It is common practice for the Justice Department to send CIDs, the civil equivalent of a subpoena, to all major players in the industry because the agency wants evidence from companies that allegedly participate in any conspiracy as well as those outside of it, according to Ethan Glass, a former trial attorney with the Justice Department now at the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP.  The source said the Obama administration had investigated similar claims in 2016 but did not take any action.  Consumer advocates learned in February that Verizon was apparently planning to lock phones as an anti-theft measure, and later were told by industry participants that Verizon was working with AT&T in hopes of convincing the GSMA to create a standard for locking the phones, according to Harold Feld, a senior vice president at Public Knowledge.  Consumer advocates support the idea of an electronic SIM card, which is in the process of being rolled out, since it allows phone owners to bargain hunt and contract with any network or to shift networks easily while traveling, said Feld.  \u201cI am very happy that the DOJ is taking its job as a cop on the beat very seriously,\u201d said Feld.","189":"FILE PHOTO: Smartphone with AT&T logo is seen in front of displayed Time Warner logo in this picture illustration taken June 13, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday approved the U.S. Justice Department's request for an expedited schedule for an appeal of a judge's ruling that allowed AT&T Inc T.N to buy content provider Time Warner.  The department said last Thursday that it would appeal a federal judge\u2019s approval of the $85.4 billion acquisition.  The court approved the Justice Department request that legal briefs must be completed by Oct. 18, with oral arguments \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d That would be a significantly faster-than-normal timetable for an appeals court to hear a case.  The Justice Department said on Wednesday, in requesting the expedited schedule, that AT&T, which owns DirecTV, could use Time Warner\u2019s Turner content, especially live sports and news, to raise the costs of smaller, rival pay TV companies.  \u201cThe merged firm will have the incentive and the ability to raise its rivals\u2019 costs and stifle growth of innovative next-generation entrants,\u201d the department said in the filing.  Essentially, they argued, AT&T could push smaller pay TV companies to pay more for Turner\u2019s CNN and sports programming, increases that would be passed on to U.S. consumers. They also argued that withholding Turner content from online distributors, such as Hulu, would stunt the development of cheaper online video.  The Justice Department said this week that District Court Judge Richard Leon \u201crejected fundamental principles of economics\u201d in his decision to rule for the companies. Leon had called one of the government\u2019s arguments against the deal \u201cgossamer thin\u201d and another \u201cpoppycock.\u201d  Under an agreement with the Justice Department, the companies closed the deal in June.  One of the many people who are skeptical that the government will prevail is AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson, who said last week that the original court decision was well reasoned. \u201cWe think the likelihood of this thing being reversed or overturned is really remote,\u201d he said.","190":"BOSTON, April 17 (Reuters) - Activist investors say telecommunications pioneer AT&T Inc won\u2019t take their calls for its upcoming annual meeting, reinforcing their concerns that the shift of the gatherings to cyberspace due to the COVID-19 pandemic would restrict shareholder input. The activists, including a retired AT&T employee and a high-profile private shareholder, both said AT&T rejected their efforts to present proxy resolutions at the April 24 event.  The meeting originally was to be held in Dallas and became one of hundreds changed to an online-only format since March to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The activists and several corporate governance specialists said it was the first time they knew of a company barring investors from introducing their resolutions in some manner.  The change could soften the edges of the gathering.  \u201cI think they\u2019re looking at this as an opportunity to have a shareholder meeting where they don\u2019t have a lot of pushback,\u201d said Jeff Rechenbach, a retired AT&T employee and union official in Cleveland. He had sponsored a resolution calling for the company to add an employee representative to its board.  AT&T spokesperson Daphne Avila said the company is asking the proponents of shareholder resolutions -- three in total -- to provide written comments to be read by management during the meeting.  \u201cThis approach will let us efficiently address the matters to be voted and then move on to additional content, specifically the CEO\u2019s state of the business discussion and questions from shareholders,\u201d she said. Like other shareholders, resolution proponents can submit questions ahead of time, she said.  AT&T\u2019s event is an early example of the hundreds of U.S. corporate annual meetings shifted online this year in an effort to limit public gatherings that could spread the coronavirus.  Activists have long complained the online-only formats give companies the chance to stifle dissent, even as issues such as climate change draw more attention. One is John Chevedden, a prolific filer and backer of shareholder resolutions including one this year calling on AT&T to have an independent board chair.  Like Rechenbach, Chevedden got an email from AT&T on Tuesday indicating he would not have a chance to speak. Chevedden said he has had difficulties at other online meetings this year including at Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co, which cut him off as he spoke, and at Bank of New York Mellon Corp which did not take his questions.  \u201cCompanies are trying to take advantage of COVID-19 and silence voices,\u201d Chevedden said.  Goodyear and BNY Mellon representatives declined to comment.  Guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as of April 7 notes a rule requiring shareholder proponents or their representatives to appear and present their proposals.  But given the current difficulties in attending meetings in person because of COVID-19 concerns, the guidance states, companies are encouraged \u201cto provide shareholder proponents or their representatives with the ability to present their proposals through alternative means, such as by phone.\u201d  An SEC spokeswoman declined further comment.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The U.S. government is seeking to stop the $85 billion deal, arguing that it would hurt consumers because AT&T, which owns pay TV service DirecTV, would have more leverage to raise prices by owning Time Warner\u2019s Turner networks, which include CNN, TBS and TNT.  Tuesday\u2019s testimony was the third day of the trial in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. that is due to last six to eight weeks.  AT&T proposed that for seven years it would submit to third-party arbitration any disagreement with distributors over the pricing for Time Warner\u2019s networks and promise not to black out programming during arbitration.  However, such concessions would not address the risks to companies like Dish because the language is vague and it is unclear who would have the expertise to arbitrate, said Warren Schlichting, group president of Dish\u2019s Sling TV, in his second day of testimony.  \u201cIt\u2019s a high-risk proposition to put your business in the hands of an arbitrator who may or may not understand your business,\u201d  Also, HBO was not part of that proposal, which is a huge issue given that one in five of Dish\u2019s customers subscribe to HBO, Schlichting said.  On cross examination, AT&T lawyer Daniel Petrocelli pointed out that Dish had asked the Justice Department to impose the arbitration arrangement as part of the Time Warner deal.  Under the proposal, the arbitrator would look at comparable services and what they pay for programming at \u201cfair market value,\u201d which Schlichting said was too vague.  \u201cMy reading is there is nothing preventing them from pushing more networks on us,\u201d he said, meaning forcing distributors to carry networks they do not want. He noted that Dish\u2019s Sling online streaming service tries to keep costs low by offering fewer networks.  U.S. District Judge Richard Leon asked Schlichting if Dish has data to prove that certain networks are not popular with viewers. When Schlichting said Dish does have that data but it does not affect negotiations, Judge Leon showed surprise.  Before the trial on Tuesday, the judge held closed talks with attorneys about what testimony Schlichting could give  in open court.  The U.S. Department of Justice called Turner CEO John Martin as a witness late in the day, and his testimony will continue Wednesday.","193":"WASHINGTON, April 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department called an economist on Wednesday to testify that allowing AT&T to purchase movie and TV production company Time Warner would cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars, as the government wrapped up its efforts to convince a judge to stop the proposed deal.  Carl Shapiro, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley, said the planned $85.4 billion merger would give AT&T, which owns DirecTV, leverage to charge more for Time Warner\u2019s Turner family of channels, which includes sports and CNN.  It would also give AT&T the opportunity to coordinate with Comcast Corp, which owns NBCU, to starve cheaper online video companies of content, he said.  Shapiro is expected to be the government\u2019s last witness as it seeks to show that the proposed merger is illegal under antitrust law because it would harm consumers. The government filed a lawsuit in November and is asking Judge Richard Leon to block the deal.  Following Shapiro, who will likely face cross examination Wednesday afternoon, AT&T\u2019s lawyers are expected to bring their own economist, Dennis Carlton of the University of Chicago.  Shapiro testified that AT&T\u2019s ownership of DirecTV means that it will likely raise rates for content when it negotiates contracts with other cable and satellite companies, and will be more willing to let contracts lapse so DirecTV could win over irritated subscribers when the rival \u201cgoes dark.\u201d  Blackouts mattered, he said. \u201cEven though they don\u2019t happen very much, that\u2019s the key to leverage,\u201d he said.  Shapiro noted that companies tend to function as one entity, rather than parts. \u201cThat (NBCU\u2019s strategy) would not be in the combined interest of the company. They would be leaving money on the table,\u201d he said.  The trial, which began in mid-March in the U.S. District Court in Washington, is expected to wrap up this month.  AT&T has denied that the merger will hike costs and questioned the government expert\u2019s model. The company has said it believes the deal would actually lead to a price decrease in prices for pay TV subscribers.

AT&T customers are seeing \u201c5G E\u201d logo on their mobile devices in over 400 markets. Although users are still using 4G network, AT&T is calling it 5G Evolution, a faster version of its existing network and a first step on the road to 5G.  5G can offer data speeds up to 50 or 100 times faster than 4G networks.  Smartphones running on both Android and Apple\u2019s iOS platforms are sporting \u201c5G E\u201d for AT&T customers, even though those phones are not equipped to support 5G.  Sprint said a survey showed 54 percent of AT&T\u2019s consumers believed their \u201c5G E\u201d network is the same as or better than a 5G network and 43 percent believed that if they buy an AT&T phone today, it would be capable of running on 5G.  Last month, Sprint said it plans to release 5G smartphones with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd in the United States during the summer, while rival Verizon Communications Inc in December also disclosed similar plans for the first half of 2019.

Under the deal, Microsoft and AT&T will also work together on so-called edge computing, which will see Microsoft technology deployed alongside AT&T\u2019s coming 5G network for applications that need extremely small delays in passing data back and forth, such as air traffic control systems for drones. The multi-year deal is worth more than $2 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The deal is a major customer win for Microsoft, which is fighting to gain market share against Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Amazon Web Services, the biggest provider of public cloud services in which customers run their software applications in data centers managed by the cloud provider.  AT&T will continue to operate its own core networking operations for cell phones and other devices. But John Donovan, chief executive of AT&T Communications, told Reuters the deal is a fundamental shift for the telecommunications provider to become \u201cpublic cloud first,\u201d meaning that it will predominately rely on data centers built by others to power the rest of its business.  \u201cThis is one of the most far-reaching initiatives we have put together because of it being so comprehensive,\u201d he said.  For Microsoft\u2019s part, the company will also gain a partner to sell its edge computing services, which will help software developers write programs for situations like factories whose machines are fitted with sensors to collect data or retail stores fitted with sensors and cameras to help keep inventories up to date.  \u201cOur general heritage of being a developer tools company, combined with the network capabilities of AT&T, is unique,\u201d Microsoft Chief Executive Sayta Nadella told Reuters.  The deal between Microsoft and AT&T came a day after AT&T said that its AT&T Business Solutions unit will tap International Business Machines Corp to help modernize its software for the cloud and move it back and forth across data centers. IBM Chief Executive Ginni Rometty told the Financial Times that deal is worth \u201cbillions\u201d of dollars but an IBM spokesman declined to confirm the remarks to Reuters.  Meanwhile, Microsoft and AT&T said Microsoft will be AT&T\u2019s \u201cpreferred\u201d cloud vendor.

Pay-TV providers have struggled to keep customers as viewers move to streaming services like Netflix Inc. AT&T has launched its own streaming service, but that too lost customers in the quarter.  Total revenue for the quarter rose nearly 18 percent to $44.83 billion but fell short of expectations of $45.11 billion.  Revenue in AT&T\u2019s wireless business was hurt by aggressive smartphone promotions. The company has tried to reduce its dependency on its phone business, which now brings in roughly 40 percent of total operating revenue, by adding media content through its $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner.  \u201cAltogether, AT&T\u2019s collection of assets remains challenged,\u201d Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with New Street Research, said in a note on Wednesday.

AT&T\u2019s WarnerMedia unit, which includes Turner and premium TV channel HBO, reported revenue of $8.38 billion in the quarter, but that was short of analysts\u2019 estimates of $8.45 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The company added a net 80,000 phone subscribers, beating analysts\u2019 forecast of a loss of 44,000 subscribers, as it leaned on the smartphone promotions to combat competition in a saturated U.S. market.  But Mobility, AT&T\u2019s largest segment and which includes its wireless business, had revenue of $17.57 billion during the quarter, missing estimates of $17.65 billion, as those promotions hurt revenue for the unit.  AT&T shares were down 3.9 percent at $30.84 on Wednesday.  Postpaid phone churn, or the rate of customer defections, was 0.93 percent during the first quarter, up from 0.84 percent in the previous year.  AT&T\u2019s entertainment segment, which includes satellite TV provider DirecTV, has been in continuous decline. Revenue from the segment fell nearly 1 percent to $11.33 billion.  AT&T also continued to lose subscribers for its DirecTV Now streaming service, which shed a net 83,000 customers during the quarter as viewers abandoned the service after their introductory price promotion plans ended.  \u201cAT&T\u2019s first-quarter earnings give a clear signal that the company is willing to compromise on growth in the short term as it struggles to cut its heavy load of debt,\u201d said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com.  \u201cAnd it\u2019s a wise thing to do considering the market is very concerned about the company\u2019s balance-sheet risk.\u201d  PAYING DOWN DEBT  AT&T\u2019s Latin America segment had revenue of $1.7 billion during the quarter, down from $2 billion in the year-ago quarter. AT&T said the segment lost $551 million due to foreign exchange pressures.  The carrier has focused on paying down its debt after the purchase of Time Warner. The company paid off $2.3 billion during the first quarter, and net debt now stands at $169 billion.

A trial is set to start on Monday.  The government argues the merger would hike pay TV subscribers bills by 45 cents a month, citing an expert analysis.  AT&T contends that analysis is fatally flawed because it does not include its commitment for seven years to agree to binding arbitration over disputes with distributors like DISH Network Corp DISH.O or Comcast Corp CMCSA.O over licensing terms.  The commitment, AT&T and Time Warner said in a legal filing released on Tuesday, \u201cis a concrete assurance that this merger has never been about raising the price of Turner content.\u201d  Time Warner\u2019s Turner owns CNN, TBS, TNT and other networks that air news, sports and other programming. Last year, the government demanded AT&T agree to divest Turner as one offer to approve the merger.  The Justice Department had urged Leon to exclude the commitment, arguing the AT&T commitment was a \u201cunilateral promise\u201d that was not relevant to whether the transaction lessens competition. Leon rejected the Justice Department\u2019s argument that the issue would \u201cwaste the court\u2019s limited time and confuse the proceedings.\u201d  John Stankey, the head of AT&T\u2019s entertainment group who is set to head the combined company\u2019s media business, said in a deposition that the company would not withdraw the commitment.  The government\u2019s analysis assumed the combined AT&T Time Warner would have \u201cbargaining leverage\u201d that it could use to compel distributors to pay higher prices for Turner networks, citing a model by an economist, AT&T said.  The Justice Department said 20 of 1,000 distributors had agreed to the arbitration offer made in November. AT&T said it modeled the commitment on a provision of the terms of the Comcast acquisition of NBCUniversal.

The company logo for AT&T is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 18, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Elliott is pressing the telecommunications giant to cut costs, make management changes and scale back expansion aspirations in one of its most ambitious investor campaigns to date.  The two sides have held discussions and there is dialogue, one of the sources said. The meetings have taken place since shortly after Elliott, one of the world\u2019s most powerful activist investors, six weeks ago sent a four-part proposal for changes to AT&T. The fund says the changes could lift the share price by at least 60% by the end of 2021.  Traditionally, activist investors and management and directors at their target companies arrange meetings after proposals are made to see where there may be common ground.  The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that the two sides could reach a settlement as soon as this month but cautioned that talks could fall apart.  Elliott\u2019s plan ranges from divesting certain businesses, eliminating $5 billion in costs, reviewing how it allocates capital and urging CEO Randall Stephenson, who has led the company since the financial crisis, to stop making acquisitions.  Spokesmen for AT&T and for Elliott declined to comment.  Elliott\u2019s $3.2 billion stake in AT&T has morphed into one of the industry\u2019s most ambitious campaigns in years not only because of AT&T\u2019s size - it has a market capitalization of $270 billion - but also for the range of issues that Elliott says should be addressed. For Elliott, which has $38 billion in assets under management, this marks one of its biggest corporate targets.  AT&T last week announced plans to delay its earnings release, a move that has sparked speculation that the two sides wanted more time for talks to progress.  Earnings are now scheduled to be released on Oct. 28, one day before it plans to unveil its HBO Max streaming service at an event in Burbank, Calif.  Elliott took aim at AT&T\u2019s $85 billion acquisition of media company TimeWarner Inc last year and the $49 billion purchase of satellite television provider DirecTV in 2015 in its letter. It also said that the company\u2019s board needs directors with domain expertise and operating skills and that it has \u201cidentified several leading candidates\u201d to discuss with the board. It did not ask for a specific number of seats on the board.  The letter struck a conciliatory note and Jesse Cohn, Elliott\u2019s portfolio manager called AT&T CEO Stephenson the night before the letter was publicized to alert the company, suggesting that talks would begin quickly.  AT&T has said that it was already exploring some of the issues Elliott has raised.","206":"Feb 28 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc:  * AT&T INC - ON THE FIBER FOOTPRINT, WE EXPECT TO GET ANOTHER 3 MILLION HOMES THIS YEAR - EXECUTIVE, CONF CALL Further company coverage:","207":"Oct 24 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc on Wednesday reported a surprise gain in U.S. net wireless subscribers who pay a monthly bill, as it began to bundle media content from Time Warner into new wireless plans.

REUTERS\/Erin Scott  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters Breakingviews) - Billionaire donors hold more sway than companies in the increasingly expensive business of Washington elections. Firms from JPMorgan to AT&T are rethinking political donations after last week\u2019s Capitol violence. But it\u2019s people like the late Sheldon Adelson and Mike Bloomberg who have far deeper pockets.  The storming of the seat of U.S. government has spurred a sea change in corporate America. AT&T, the biggest company spender in the last election cycle, said on Monday that it is suspending political donations to Republican lawmakers who objected without evidence to the November presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump. Others, like JPMorgan, paused their giving altogether to reassess their strategy.  If the funding hiatus continues, that will hurt Republicans, especially, as they seek to gain majorities in Congress in the 2022 midterm elections. Through political action committees, or PACs, AT&T contributed more than $2.6 million to candidates in the last cycle while JPMorgan doled out about $1 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.  But wealthy individuals give far more. Casino mogul Adelson, who died on Monday, and his wife Miriam were the top contributors for the 2020 election, spending $218 million to back Republicans. Bloomberg came in second with $152 million to support Democrats.  An end or pause in spending by these billionaires would have a big direct impact on candidates. Blackstone\u2019s Steve Schwarzman gave $20 million to the Senate Leadership Fund in the months leading up to the November election and then handed out another $15 million to the group to help two Republican candidates in this month\u2019s Georgia runoff races for the upper chamber, which collectively cost more than $830 million. Democrats ended up winning, splitting the Senate 50-50 with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris set to cast tie-breaking votes.  One Republican feeling heat is Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who spearheaded the challenge to the election results and showed support for Trump supporters before they ransacked the Capitol. Hallmark Cards said it had asked Hawley to return $7,000 in PAC donations over the last two years. But that pales compared to the $250,000 that Citadel\u2019s Ken Griffin gave to a so-called super PAC that supported him in his 2018 Senate bid. Taking that kind of money out of campaigns would really make candidates sit up and listen.","210":"April 24 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc said Friday that Chief Operating Officer John Stankey will take over as chief executive officer, effective July 1.

Opening arguments are expected Wednesday before Judge Richard Leon, who will decide if the Justice Department was correct to seek to block the $85 billion deal on the grounds that it would hurt cable television rivals and, by extension, their consumers.  The government estimates that the deal would hike an average subscriber\u2019s monthly cable bill by 45 cents. It filed its lawsuit in November.  At a hearing to discuss how to handle sensitive business information in the trial, AT&T lawyer Daniel Petrocelli argued that it would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for Time Warner to withhold programming in hopes that disgruntled customers would drop their cable company and sign up with AT&T\u2019s DirecTV, as the government has alleged they could do.  He argued that Time Warner would lose millions of dollars a month in fees and advertising, and that the few subscribers that DirecTV could gain would not make up the difference.  Petrocelli also pointed to a voluntary commitment that AT&T made to distributors to refrain from withholding programming if there is an impasse in licensing talks. Twenty of its 1,000 distributors signed on.  Justice Department lawyer Craig Conrath said the government\u2019s first two witnesses would discuss their companies\u2019 negotiations in buying Time Warner content. He did not identify the witnesses.  \u201cWhat drives these customers to have concerns is that their negotiating partner (Time Warner) is being acquired by someone they compete with,\u201d said Conrath.  An official from Google\u2019s YouTube will testify on the importance of Time Warner\u2019s Turner family of stations, which includes CNN, to DirecTV\u2019s rivals, a Justice Department lawyer said previously.  AT&T\u2019s Petrocelli also noted the role of big technology companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google in transforming how people watch television and, more to the point, winning away advertisers from the pay TV companies.  \u201cThey are running away with the industry,\u201d said Petrocelli, noting the internet companies\u2019 skill at targeting ads to the right consumer. \u201cCable bills can\u2019t go up any more because people won\u2019t pay any more.\u201d  Conrath indicated that an expert on advertising, whom he did not identify, would testify on this issue.  AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson and Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes are also expected to testify during the trial, which the judge has said would last six to eight weeks.  Looming over the trial is the question of whether U.S. President Donald Trump, who criticized the deal on the campaign trail and again as president, may have influenced the Justice Department\u2019s decision to oppose the transaction.

The Supreme Court\u2019s action means the lawsuit can move forward. Its action may increase the likelihood of a settlement that would partially reimburse subscribers.  A batch of lawsuits, filed in 2015 on behalf of DirecTV subscribers, argued that exclusive agreements between the NFL and DirecTV unlawfully eliminated competition for the live telecasts.  The cases were consolidated before U.S. District Judge Beverly Reid O\u2019Connell in Los Angeles, who then dismissed the litigation in 2017 and ruled that the plaintiffs had not shown that the NFL\u2019s arrangement with DirecTV undermined competition.  O\u2019Connell, who died that same year, decided that the agreements did not reduce the output of games available to the public. O\u2019Connell also noted that DirecTV was required to renegotiate its licensing agreement with the NFL every few years, so competitors had the opportunity to vie for the television rights.  The San Francisco-based U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals revived the case in 2019, finding that lawyers for the subscribers had plausibly made the case that, absent the agreements, there would be a stronger market for game broadcasts and many more telecasts would be made available.

The Justice Department focused on Time Warner\u2019s Turner assets, saying cable networks needed Turner channels like CNN and live sports to survive.

Comcast said in May it was preparing an all-cash offer of more than $50 billion for most of Fox\u2019s media assets, competing with a Disney offer. Sources say it will only go forward if the judge allows the AT&T merger with Time Warner.  DEAL BLOCKED ALTOGETHER  If the deal is stopped, AT&T, in particular, would need a new strategy.  Time Warner is in a stronger position to go it alone, and has had a string of solid quarterly earnings reports with unique content like HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d CNN, and Turner Sports\u2019 March Madness basketball.  In contrast, AT&T\u2019s quarterly reports have been up and down over the past two years; with the ups attributed to stronger wireless subscriptions in some instances and the downs often blamed on lost DirecTV subscriptions.  That said, while AT&T has fought tooth and nail to save this deal, one industry analyst argued that losing Time Warner might be good for AT&T.  \u201cI think AT&T would probably be better off if the deal fell through. The value it gets for it (Time Warner) doesn\u2019t generate a sufficient return to justify the cost of the deal,\u201d said Allan Nichols at Morningstar.  DEAL ALLOWED WITH DIVESTMENT OF DIRECTV OR TURNER  The companies may decide to appeal a ruling that requires AT&T to sell DirecTV, with 20 million subscribers, or orders Time Warner to sell Turner to get the deal done.  When the government suggested at trial that AT&T sell DirecTV as an alternative to stopping the deal entirely, Daniel Petrocelli, speaking for the companies, objected strongly, saying: \u201cThat is an effort to kill the deal.\u201d  DEAL ALLOWED WITH NEW CONDITIONS, NOT DIVESTITURES  During the trial, Leon asked few questions but many of them focused on the adequacy of the arbitration proposal.  AT&T offered last year to submit pricing disputes with other pay TV companies over Turner\u2019s CNN, sports and other channels to third-party arbitration. The companies offered not to black out programming during arbitration for seven years.  In a court filing, cable provider RCN and others urged the judge to include all Time Warner assets, especially HBO, in the offer and to allow broadcasters to learn what other distributors paid for content as part of the process.","229":"Nov 29 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc said it expects 2019 adjusted earnings per share growth in the low single digits, following the acquisition of Time Warner, now known as WarnerMedia.

U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen arrives at his hotel in New York City, U.S., May 9, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Trump expressed opposition to the merger during the campaign and his administration ultimately chose to fight it, with the Justice Department filing suit in November to block the agreement. The case has yet to be decided.  The Justice Department wants AT&T to divest Time Warner\u2019s DirecTV unit or Turner networks as a condition of approving the acquisition. AT&T has argued that divestitures would destroy some of the consumer value of the merger.  Michael Avenatti, an attorney for porn star Stormy Daniels, revealed earlier this week that Cohen had received payments from a number of companies in 2017 and 2018, including AT&T, the Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG, Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd and Columbus Nova LLC.  Columbus Nova was listed in November 2017 as part of the Renova Group, a conglomerate controlled by Viktor Vekselberg, a businessman with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.  On Tuesday, Avenatti claimed that Cohen received $500,000 from billionaire Vekselberg in the months after the 2016 U.S. election. Reuters could not immediately verify the claim and it was not clear how Avenatti would have knowledge of any payment from Vekselberg to Cohen.  AT&T said on Tuesday that it had hired Essential Consultants, a company linked to Cohen, in early 2017 around the time of Trump\u2019s inauguration, to advise it on working with the new administration.  On Wednesday, AT&T said it had cooperated fully with Special Counsel Robert Mueller in the Russia probe in November and December.  AT&T declined to comment on Thursday\u2019s Post story, and Cohen\u2019s attorney, Stephen Ryan, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  In an email to employees dated May 9 and seen by Reuters on Thursday, AT&T said that in early 2017, \u201cWe hired several consultants to help us understand how the president and his administration might approach a wide range of policy issues important to the company, including regulatory reform at the FCC, corporate tax reform and antitrust enforcement.\u201d  The Washington Post reported that the internal documents it saw specified that Cohen would provide the company advice on its merger with Time Warner.  It reported that the documents showed the company turned to Cohen three days after Trump was elected, seeking his help on a wide range of issues pending before the federal government.  It was unclear what insights Cohen, a longtime real estate attorney, would have been able to offer AT&T on a complicated telecommunications-entertainment merger, the Post reported.  Following Trump\u2019s election, corporations have paid Cohen at least $2.95 million through Essential Consultants, the Post reported, citing figures confirmed by the companies.  Essential Consultants was the same firm Cohen used in October to pay Stormy Daniels $130,000 in exchange for an agreement not to disclose her alleged affair with Trump.  Novartis said this week that it had provided information about its dealings with Cohen to the special counsel.","236":"(Reuters) - AT&T Inc T.N exceeded analyst expectations on Wednesday for net wireless subscribers who pay a monthly bill, as it eked out some growth in a saturated market and continued to bundle media content from Time Warner into new wireless plans.

AT&T lost 778,000 premium TV subscribers, a category that includes DirecTV satellite and U-verse television customers, much more than the 544,000 lost in the first quarter. The company also lost 168,000 streaming DirecTV Now accounts. AT&T said it expects a similar level of video losses to continue in the current quarter.  Still, it added a net 72,000 phone subscribers, beating analyst estimates for 27,000, according to research firm FactSet.  Postpaid phone churn, or the rate of customer defections, was 0.86%, up from 0.82% in the previous year.  Shares of the company were up 2.1% at $32.77.  AT&T closed its $85-billion acquisition of media company Time Warner in June last year, creating a new business segment called WarnerMedia to house assets including the Turner TV networks and premium channel HBO.  The new WarnerMedia segment, which includes Turner and premium TV channel HBO, reported revenue of $8.4 billion, against analyst expectations for $8.3 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The company said WarnerMedia\u2019s new streaming service HBO Max is slated to launch in spring of 2020.  AT&T has been focused on paying down its debt after the purchase of Time Warner, which pushed its net debt load to about $180 billion last year.  The company spent $6.8 billion on paying off the debt in the second quarter, and said it was on track to cut its net debt load to about $150 billion by the end of the year.  AT&T also raised its free cash flow guidance for 2019 to around $28 billion.  \u201cThe debt we have will be at a very reasonable place as we exit this year, (and) I fully expect that we\u2019ll be buying some stocks back as we go on this year and (expect) cash flows to continue,\u201d Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said in a conference call with analysts.  He also said that AT&T strategy will not be impacted by the result of the proposed merger between T-Mobile and Sprint for the next three years.

Analysts were expecting $44.85 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Net income attributable to AT&T fell to $3.71 billion, or 51 cents per share, from $5.13 billion, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  (Reuters) - CBS Corp CBS.N fell short of Wall Street estimates for third-quarter revenue on Tuesday, as a 19-day carriage dispute with AT&T Inc T.N pressured advertising sales during the period.  Shares of CBS and sister company Viacom Inc VIAB.O were down more than 3% in morning trading.  CBS stations went dark for more than 6.5 million DirecTV, DirecTV Now and AT&T U-verse customers in at least 14 U.S. cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, before CBS and AT&T signed a new content carriage agreement on Aug. 8.  Sales from advertising, which was also hurt by the timing of the broadcast of certain sporting events, fell 6.8% to $1.18 billion in the quarter from a year earlier. The year-ago period was boosted by the 2018 U.S. midterm elections related ads.  The distributor of renowned shows such as \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d and \u201cNCIS\u201d reported an 11.5% increase in its affiliate revenue, or the fees collected from cable, satellite and online distributors, to $1.12 billion.  CBS is in the process of re-uniting with Viacom to create a larger multi-platform content company and re-make media mogul Sumner Redstone\u2019s U.S. entertainment empire at a time of intensifying streaming wars.

FILE PHOTO: The Viacom office is seen in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, April 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  Although the boards of CBS and Viacom have not discussed or decided on pursuing a merger, these sources say they are studying AT&T\u2019s impact on Viacom and how it affects the company\u2019s motivation to pursue a CBS merger. Viacom needs to resolve the AT&T contract before considering any other strategic moves including mergers and acquisitions, sources said.  Both companies are controlled by the Redstone family\u2019s National Amusements Inc, which pushed for a merger last year but backed off as CBS explores other options before deciding on another run at Viacom.  Viacom would take a substantial financial hit without an AT&T deal. AT&T is Viacom\u2019s largest distributor, representing 24.5 million total video subscribers, and was responsible for about 15 percent of Viacom\u2019s 2018 revenue. At stake are about $2 billion annually in fees and advertising, which are seen declining in any new deal, according to Wall Street estimates.  The 2017 Viacom and Charter Communications Inc renewal resulted in a 15 percent rate decrease. A similar outcome with AT&T could lead to a $156 million drop in annual affiliate fees paid by AT&T to Viacom, although some analysts have estimated an approximate 10 percent decrease this time.  Viacom and AT&T declined to comment. Negotiations continued as of Friday afternoon, sources said.  Failure to reach a deal is seen emboldening CBS and Viacom\u2019s controlling shareholder\u2019s position to put the companies together to give them better leverage in future distribution contract talks.  \u201cViacom\u2019s clear need for greater negotiating leverage after being dropped by AT&T might be the final factor necessary to drive the long-speculated CBS-Viacom merger given the common control of both companies by the Redstone-controlled National Amusements,\u201d Credit Suisse analyst Doug Mitchelson said in a research note this week.  If AT&T and Viacom walk away from the table, the No. 2 U.S. telecoms company\u2019s position could also be weakened, especially if it faces a combined CBS and Viacom by the end of June, when CBS\u2019s contract with AT&T expires.  Dropping the CBS broadcast network and NFL games would be disastrous to AT&T, and they may end up paying more for Viacom channels through CBS, analysts have said.  Losing Viacom will also weaken AT&T\u2019s leverage as it faces Walt Disney Co later this year, according to Mitchelson.  Shares of Viacom closed down 2.46 percent at $25.34 on Friday while AT&T shares closed flat at $31.07.","239":"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday gave a ringing endorsement to AT&T Inc\u2019s planned acquisition of Time Warner Inc without any conditions, opening the door for companies such as Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc to pursue deals to buy creators of media content.  Smartphone with AT&T logo is seen in front of displayed Time Warner logo in this picture illustration taken June 13, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The ruling by Judge Richard Leon bit.ly\/2Jxx6qE of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia brings an end to a six-week antitrust trial in which U.S. regulators argued that the $85 billion deal would give AT&T undue leverage against rival cable providers that relied on Time Warner's content.  The judge\u2019s strong approval, and scathing opinion that urged the government not to seek a stay if they opposed the ruling, will give telecommunications providers the confidence that similar types of acquisitions will also have a shot at clearing regulatory hurdles, and could spur other copycat mergers this year, industry analysts and dealmakers said.  Investors are now also expecting major media consolidation, with Twenty-First Century Fox Inc shares rising more than 6 percent in after-market trading. Cable network owner Discovery Inc saw shares increase 3.2 percent while mobile providers, Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc, which are waiting for a government approval of their own, also saw a bump following the decision.  AT&T said that controlling Time Warner\u2019s cable brands will help it craft new types of content to retain its customers as web-based rivals like Netflix Inc woo audiences away from traditional pay-TV subscriptions.  For cable companies feeling the pain of cord-cutting, similar deals for coveted media brands could help them build out new content offerings and offset expected declines in revenues, analysts and dealmakers told Reuters.  The Justice Department had argued that AT&T\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner would allow it to charge premium prices to rivals who relied on its Turner and HBO channels to woo customers to their cable plans, potentially giving it an unfair advantage in the pay-TV market. Now this will be a less of a concern for companies.  \u201cThis decision could serve as a \u2018green light\u2019 for other potential M&A, including Comcast\u2019s ongoing pursuit of FOX,\u201d said John Hodulik, an analyst at UBS, in a note.  Regulators will still likely scrutinize similar deals, and there is no guarantee that the district court\u2019s approval of AT&T\u2019s merger with Time Warner means that other major media acquisitions would be approved, several antitrust attorneys told Reuters.  Still, at least one company, Comcast, the largest U.S. cable provider, had been waiting for the court decision before making any large M&A moves in media, sources have said.  Rival cable company Comcast is now likely to go ahead with its planned attempt to woo Fox away from Walt Disney Co, which said it would acquire most assets of the media company for around $50 billion last year.  \u201cRegardless of what happens on the appeal front, expect Comcast to put forth an all-cash bid in the next day or so at a premium to Disney,\u201d said Mary Ann Halford, senior adviser to OC&C Strategy Consultants.  Comcast is aiming to gain control over Fox assets such as its Twentieth Century Fox Film and TV studios, which includes brands ranging from X-Men to The Simpsons, as well many of its cable networks.  The court ruling could also open the door for Verizon, AT&T\u2019S main rival, to bid for a media company, UBS\u2019 Hodulik added.  However, in Verizon\u2019s most recent quarterly earnings call, executives said they would rather sit out the current consolidation, and instead build out its content offerings through partnerships with independent media companies.  It also appointed a new chief executive officer earlier this month, Hans Vestberg, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, in a move that signaled Verizon would likely double down on its existing telecommunications business.  Still, one potential target for Verizon would be a combined CBS Corp and Viacom Inc, analysts have said, assuming that on ongoing legal battle between CBS\u2019s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, and the company\u2019s board, is resolved.  In a recent court filing, Redstone said her long-term plan was to create a combined company, which would unite media assets including CBS\u2019 broadcast networks, Showtime, MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, and then sell it.

AppNexus, which runs a digital platform for advertisers to purchase online ads, will become part of AT&T advertising & analytics, as the U.S. telecom company aims to expand its online advertising to better compete with Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google and Facebook Inc FB.O.  The company will start selling targeted ads for Turner networks such as TNT and CNN \u201cin short order,\u201d John Stankey, chief executive of newly named AT&T unit WarnerMedia had said last week.  \u201cThink of this as buying a sofa to furnish the new house (Time Warner) they just bought,\u201d said Moffett Nathanson analyst Craig Moffett, adding that AppNexus will add muscle to AT&T\u2019s strategy of making its ads more targeted.

FILE PHOTO: The AT&T logo is seen on a store in Golden, Colorado United States July 25, 2017. REUTERS\/Rick Wilking  The exact price TPG is willing to pay could not be learned, but sources said the deal could value DirecTV at more than $15 billion. Were the negotiations to conclude successfully, a deal could be announced in the coming weeks, added the sources, who requested anonymity because the matter is confidential.  AT&T and TPG declined to comment.  AT&T shares rose close to 1% on the news to an intraday high of $29.05, giving the company a market capitalization of nearly $210 billion. The shares unofficially closed Friday at $28.92, up 0.3%.  The advanced talks with TPG are the culmination of an auction that AT&T ran for DirecTV for several months. The deal would crystallize a financial hit for AT&T, which valued DirecTV at about $67 billion including debt when it agreed to acquire it in 2014.  Since then, DirecTV has been bleeding subscribers, with users shifting to less costly online streaming services such as Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Prime service.  AT&T has said it lost 590,000 subscribers in the third quarter spanning its DirecTV, U-verse and AT&T TV platforms. It is under pressure to trim its swelling debt pile as it invests more in 5G and other wireless services.  AT&T\u2019s biggest deal, its $85 billion acquisition of media conglomerate Time Warner in 2018, has soured in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, as a plunge in movie theater attendance weighs on its film revenue.  WarnerMedia, the segment that contains HBO and the company\u2019s movie and TV studio, generated revenue of $7.5 billion in the third quarter of 2020, down from $8.4 billion in the year-ago quarter.  Thanks to more people seeking entertainment at home, however, AT&T reported 38 million subscribers in the United States for both its premium TV channel HBO and HBO Max during the third quarter, reaching its goal for 2021 a year early.  TPG, which previously invested in companies in the sector such as U.S. regional cable TV operator Astound and Spanish language broadcaster Univision, has about $85 billion in assets under management, according to its website.","247":"(Reuters) - AT&T Inc T.N reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday as the No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier lost subscribers from its pay TV business, sending its shares down more than 3 percent after the close of trading.  The company has been relying on promotions and discounts to stabilize its wireless and pay-TV subscriber numbers, which have taken a toll on its margins, New Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin said in an interview.  AT&T is fighting the U.S Department of Justice in court to complete its $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner Inc TWX.N, which it has called necessary for it to compete for advertising dollars and in an industry increasingly dependent on content.  Chaplin said AT&T\u2019s entertainment business performed worse than he expected in the quarter, coming in 4.5 percent lower than his forecast.  Net income attributable to the company rose to $4.76 billion, or 75 cents per share, in the quarter, from $3.47 billion, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier.  On an adjusted basis, the company earned 85 cents per share in the first quarter, missing analyst estimates of 87 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Total operating revenue fell 3.4 percent to $38.04 billion.  The company attributed the revenue decline to a new accounting standard and held its full-year profit forecast steady. Excluding the accounting changes, revenue would have been $38.9 billion.  Analysts expected revenue of $39.31 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Shares of the Dallas-based company fell more than 3 percent to $34.05 after the bell.  The company, which owns satellite television service DirecTV, lost 187,000 traditional U.S. video customers, fewer than the 257,000 customers analysts had expected them to lose, according to research firm FactSet.  As more viewers seek to cut pay-TV packages, AT&T added 312,000 customers to its DirecTV Now streaming service.  The Time Warner deal, which would give AT&T access to content like HBO's \"Game of Thrones\" and Warner Bros' \"Justice League,\" reflects AT&T's effort to compete for advertising dollars against Alphabet's GOOGL.O Google and Facebook FB.O.

AT&T, which has invested heavily to transform itself into a media and telecommunications conglomerate, reported 36 million subscribers for both its premium TV channel HBO and the new streaming service HBO Max, which launched in May. In the first quarter, HBO had about 33 million customers.  As the health crisis led to widespread stay-at-home orders to curb the spread of the virus and upended the economy, it has particularly hurt AT&T\u2019s media business due to the loss of live sports broadcasts and delayed productions.  \u201cI don\u2019t expect we\u2019re going to see much change in the third quarter around those challenges that are in front of us,\u201d AT&T Chief Executive John Stankey said during an earnings call with analysts.

It has thrice postponed the release of Christopher Nolan\u2019s highly anticipated movie \u201cTenet\u201d as theater chains remained largely shut.  The pandemic had a $1.5 billion impact on WarnerMedia revenue, AT&T said during the call with analysts.  In the second quarter, AT&T lost 151,000 mobile phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill, which included the loss of 338,000 customers who stopped paying their bills, but were kept on the network as part of a federal program to ensure Americans remain connected on their cell phones during the pandemic.  Analysts had expected the company to add 6,800 subscribers, according to research firm FactSet.

Under the agreement announced on Thursday, Telefonica will use AT&T\u2019s wireless \u2018last-mile\u2019 equipment - the final link of telecom networks that delivers service to consumers through towers, antennas and fiber-optic cables.  After a three-year transition period, Telefonica will see savings of 230 million euros ($254 million) per year, as well as a reduction in net debt of 500 million euros. Financial terms of the deal with AT&T were not disclosed.  Analysts framed the deal as a lifeline for Telefonica in Mexico, where the company has long struggled to gain traction. Despite a 2013-14 reform intended to lessen its dominance, America Movil still holds nearly two-thirds of mobile lines in Mexico, according to data from telecoms regulator IFT.  AT&T, too, has failed to significantly dent America Movil\u2019s market share since it spent billions to enter the country in 2015 by buying two local carriers.  The agreement will give both Telefonica and AT&T a boost in a brutally competitive market, said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics.  \u201cIt\u2019s the two upstarts going up against the big guy,\u201d Entner said. \u201cYou need to find all the friends that you can when someone has such a dominant position.\u201d  Telefonica Mexico Chief Executive Officer Camilo Aya told reporters the deal with AT&T was not exclusive, meaning the Spanish firm remains free to use other companies\u2019 infrastructure. Telefonica will retain control over its operations, and its traffic will remain separate, he added.  Aya said the agreement was part of a global trend to better position companies against rivals.  \u201cYou need a lot of scale to compete in this business,\u201d Aya said at an event in Mexico City.  Telefonica has been outspoken about the difficulties it has faced in Mexico. Miguel Calderon, vice president of regulation at Telefonica Mexico, said the deal would ensure the firm remained in the country.  The Spanish company has also complained about the cost of spectrum in Mexico, lobbying the government for a discount. After the deal with AT&T is complete, Telefonica will no longer need to pay for spectrum, driving down costs.  Monica Aspe, vice president of external affairs for AT&T Mexico, described the accord as an innovative agreement between telecom companies.  \u201cWhat this agreement does is strengthen the ability to compete,\u201d she said.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The judge\u2019s decision is crucial to the future of both companies and will likely determine how aggressive Republican-controlled antitrust regulators will be in coming years. U.S. President Donald Trump opposes the deal, and critics want to know if Trump\u2019s antipathy for Time Warner\u2019s CNN news network influenced regulators.  In their final briefs before the trial opens on March 19, the two sides disagreed on whether the $85 billion deal would harm rivals in pay television or online video and sparred over whether consumers would pay more because of the planned merger.  The Justice Department filed a lawsuit in November to stop AT&T, which owns DirecTV and other products with 25 million subscribers, from buying movie and TV show maker Time Warner, which owns HBO and CNN, among many other channels.  It argued the deal would mean higher prices for rival cable and online video distributors and for consumers.  Investors and company executives had been expecting more leeway in mergers with a Republican administration that vowed to reduce government regulation. The outcome of the case could affect other pending vertical mergers, in which different parts of a supply chain, rather than rivals in the same business, join together. Health insurer Cigna Corp wants to buy pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co and CVS Health Corp wants to acquire health insurer Aetna Inc.  \u201cIf the Justice Department loses to AT&T in court this will substantially raise the barriers to the Justice Department bringing another vertical challenge such as with respect to CVS\/Aetna or Cigna\/Express Scripts,\u201d said Seth Bloom, a veteran of the Justice Department now in private practice.  GOVERNMENT SAYS CONSUMERS WILL PAY MORE; AT&T SAYS NO  The Justice Department used economic modeling to show that consumers will pay their pay TV provider more for Turner Broadcasting content, if U.S. District Judge Richard Leon allows the deal.  \u201cThe acquisition would give AT&T a new tool to slow down the development and growth of disruptive online competitors in the future,\u201d the department added in its brief. \u201cAT&T can profess it wants to lead the charge to the future, but its internal documents reveal a less attractive reality.\u201d  For its part, AT&T said the merger would result in \u201cmore than $2.5 billion in annual synergies by 2020 and more than $25 billion in total synergies on a net present value basis.\u201d  AT&T and Time Warner said prices would not rise because the company would compete with newer media companies like Facebook Inc , Alphabet Inc , Amazon.com Inc and Netflix Inc.  \u201cNothing will be withheld from competitors; consumer prices will not go up,\u201d the companies said, arguing the lawsuit itself was holding back consumer access to better products.  On Thursday, 11 former Justice Department officials ranging from Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney, and John Dean, President Richard Nixon\u2019s lawyer during the Watergate scandal, urged Judge Leon to reconsider his refusal to allow AT&T to demand communications between the White House and Justice Department about the merger probe.","253":"PRAGUE (Reuters) - Investment group PPF, owned by the Czech Republic's richest man Petr Kellner, is close to concluding talks on buying a majority stake in Central European Media Enterprises (CME) from U.S. firm AT&T T.N, Czech and Bulgarian media reported on Thursday.

In filings sent to the court last week and unsealed on Tuesday, the Justice Department reiterated that if AT&T owned Time Warner it would have the incentive and opportunity to withhold CNN, HBO and live sports from pay TV companies like Charter Communications CHTR.O.  The government also said it would have the incentive to refuse to license its networks to cheaper online TV distributors, like Hulu since these cheaper services bite into pay TV revenues.  The government estimated the increased cost to industry rivals at $580 million a year and asked in its post-trial brief that the deal be deemed illegal and stopped.  The government said Leon could order AT&T to sell an asset - either DirecTV, with more than 20 million subscribers, or Time Warner\u2019s Turner channels.  \u201cThe evidence demonstrated that the bulk (though not all) of the anticompetitive effects flow from the combination of Turner with DirecTV,\u201d the Justice Department said.  AT&T said in its final brief, which was available last week, that the judge should reject any request by the government to force it to sell DirecTV or Turner, claiming it would \u201cdestroy the very consumer value this merger was designed to unlock.\u201d  AT&T and Time Warner also said the deal would help them compete with internet titans like Facebook FB.O and Netflix NFLX.O. \"The government did not even begin to make a credible case that the merger would likely harm competition, substantially or even just a little,\" AT&T said. \"This is not a close case.\"  AT&T argued that Time Warner\u2019s licensing fees from pay TV and online distributors were too valuable for the company to forego.  AT&T also sought to assuage critics by offering to submit any disagreement with distributors over pricing for Time Warner\u2019s networks to third-party arbitration and to promise not to black out programming during arbitration for seven years.  The government dismissed the offer as \u201chalf-baked\u201d since it covers only the Turner channels, not HBO.  Leon asked few questions during the trial, but asked witnesses several times if they felt the arbitration proposal was adequate.  The deal, announced in October 2016, was quickly denounced by Donald Trump, who as a candidate and later as president has been critical of Time Warner\u2019s CNN.  Before the trial started, AT&T lawyers said the Time Warner deal may have been singled out for government enforcement but Leon rejected their bid to force the disclosure of White House communications that might have shed light on the matter.","255":"WASHINGTON, June 12 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc won approval from a U.S. court on Tuesday to buy Time Warner Inc for $85 billion, allowing AT&T to compete with internet companies that dominate digital advertising and providing new sources of revenue.  The planned deal is seen as a turning point for a media industry that has been upended by companies like Netflix Inc and Google which produce content and sell it online directly to consumers, without requiring a pricey cable subscription. Distributors including cable, satellite and wireless carriers all see buying content companies as a way to add revenue.  The ruling could also prompt a cascade of pay TV companies buying television and movie makers, with Comcast Corp\u2019s bid for some Twenty-First Century Fox Inc assets potentially the first out of the gate.  The merger, including debt, would be the fourth largest deal ever attempted in the global telecom, media and entertainment space, according to Thomson Reuters data. It would also be the 12th largest deal in any sector, the data showed.  The Justice Department filed a lawsuit to stop the deal in November 2017, saying that AT&T\u2019s ownership of both DirecTV and Time Warner would give AT&T unfair leverage against rival cable providers that relied on Time Warner\u2019s content, such as CNN and HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d  AT&T in a six-week trial argued that the purchase of Time Warner would allow it to gain information about viewers needed to target digital advertising, much like Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google already do.  AT&T and other wireless carriers need to find new sources of revenue as the mobile phone market stagnates and more customers abandon pricey cable and satellite packages for streaming services they can watch on their phones or televisions.  The government estimated costs to industry rivals, such as Charter Communications Inc, would increase by $580 million a year if AT&T owned Time Warner.  To assuage the Trump administration\u2019s criticisms, AT&T offered to submit pricing disagreements with other pay TV companies over Turner\u2019s channels to third-party arbitration. The companies further offered not to black out programming during arbitration for seven years.  Announced in October 2016, the deal was quickly denounced by Donald Trump, who as a candidate and later as president has been critical of Time Warner\u2019s CNN and its coverage.  Before the trial started, AT&T lawyers said the Time Warner deal may have been singled out for government enforcement but Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia rejected their bid to force the disclosure of White House communications that might have shed light on the matter.  The deal cost AT&T\u2019s top lobbyist, Bob Quinn, his job in May after it became public that AT&T had paid Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Michael Cohen $600,000 for advice on winning approval.  The ruling could also have implications for CBS Corp\u2019s potential tie-up with Viacom Inc, which is already uncertain because of a lawsuit between CBS\u2019s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, and its board.","256":"(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc\u2019s shares hit a record high on Wednesday as approval for AT&T Inc\u2019s $85 billion buyout of Time Warner Inc spurred speculation that Comcast Corp would make an offer for most of Fox\u2019s assets.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  A firm offer from Comcast, widely expected later in the day, could upend Fox\u2019s $52 billion all-stock deal to be bought by Walt Disney Co.  U.S. District Judge Richard Leon on Tuesday approved AT&T\u2019s buyout of Time Warner, rebuffing an attempt by U.S. President Donald Trump to block the takeover and potentially clearing the path for more such deals in a rapidly changing media industry.  Fox shares rose 7 percent in afternoon trade. Shares of other telecom and media companies such as Sprint Corp, CBS Corp and Discovery Inc were all up between 1 percent to 3 percent. Time Warner rose almost 3 percent, while Disney was up 2 percent.  While the judge\u2019s approval of AT&T\u2019s deal for Time Warner may embolden Comcast, it does not guarantee clear passage for its acquisition of Fox\u2019s entertainment business, according to antitrust lawyers.  Henry Su, an antitrust expert with Constantine Cannon LLP, said that Comcast already owns significant amounts of content because it bought NBC Universal.  Both companies operate television and film studios, have a stake in streaming service Hulu and own regional sports networks.  Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson, said Judge Leon\u2019s opinion will be seen as a green light for Comcast to bid for Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox, but tipped Disney as the potential winner in a bidding war.  \u201cWe continue to believe that Disney has the superior balance sheet, cost of debt, equity and rationale to emerge victorious over Comcast in a bidding war,\u201d Moffett said.  Comcast said in May it was in advanced stages of preparing a higher all-cash offer for Fox\u2019s assets but did not indicate the value of its bid. Reuters reported last November that both Comcast and Verizon Communications Inc had expressed interest in buying Fox\u2019s assets.  The move by media companies to consolidate highlights the threat from online players such as Netflix Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, which sell content online directly to consumers, without requiring a pricey cable subscription.  AT&T\u2019s stock, however, was down 5 percent, with analysts raising concerns about the debt the company would absorb. Research firm MoffettNathanson said AT&T will carry $249 billion of debt after the merger.  Cowen and Co analyst Gregory Williams played down the drop in AT&T\u2019s stock price.  \u201cOnce technically driven volatility wears off we expect the stock to move higher as closure will likely provide a new investor catalyst including about $1.5 billion in anticipated cost synergies,\u201d Williams said.","257":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - HBO Chief Executive Richard Plepler will leave the premium television network owned by U.S. wireless carrier AT&T Inc after nearly 28 years at the company, Plepler said in a memo to HBO employees on Thursday.

The FTC sued AT&T in 2014 on the grounds that the No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier failed to inform consumers it would slow, or \u201cthrottle,\u201d the speeds of heavy data users on unlimited plans. In some cases, data speeds were slowed by nearly 90 percent, the FTC said.  AT&T had argued that it was exempt from FTC regulation because it is a common carrier. A three-member appeals court agreed, and the FTC appealed to a full panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. That larger court ruled for the agency and revived the lawsuit.  The lawsuit has been closely watched because critics warned that the prior ruling could leave internet service providers without a U.S. regulator. The Federal Communications Commission in December voted 3-2 to end the net neutrality rules that were designed to ensure a free and open internet and transfer oversight of ISPs to the FTC.  \u201cToday\u2019s decision on jurisdiction does not address the merits of the case.

AT&T said in a statement on Wednesday that the decision to withdraw Vrio\u2019s IPO was made based on current market conditions, but did not elaborate.  Earlier on Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters that the initial public offering had been postponed.  The company\u2019s stock was originally scheduled to debut on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \u201cVRIO\u201d on Thursday.  Bookrunners Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley had downsized the television service provider\u2019s IPO to 15 million Class A shares from 29.7 million Class A shares, following significant investor pushback.  The IPO\u2019s indicated price range was also lowered to $16 to $17 each from the prior $19 to $22 per share on Wednesday.  Cable television service providers have been facing tough competition as the industry battles with customers cancelling accounts and moving to video streaming services such as Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Amazon Prime.  AT&T\u2019s initial plan was to sell Vrio to pay down debt which will increase to about $180 billion once its acquisition of Time Warner Inc closes.  AT&T in February filed confidentially for an IPO for the unit, which includes satellite and cable television services in Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, among others, prompting analysts to say that the No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier probably was not able to find a buyer.","262":"The entrance to Walt Disney studios is seen in Burbank, California, U.S. August 6, 2018.

Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is expected to rule at 4 p.m. ET (2000 GMT) on whether the $85 billion deal may go forward more than 1-1\/2 years after it was announced.  The government argued in a six-week trial this spring that AT&T\u2019s ownership of DirecTV, which has 20 million subscribers, would become too powerful if combined with Time Warner, which owns Turner\u2019s sports and CNN news. That power would allow the company to raise prices for pay TV rivals and online streaming services, the government said.  AT&T said the deal was legal, and pre-emptively offered to take any disputes with pay TV rivals to arbitration while refraining from withholding content, or \u201cgoing dark\u201d, during the arbitration.  If AT&T wins, the Justice Department may rethink whether to sue to stop other deals where a company buys a supplier, known as a \u201cvertical merger.\u201d  \u201cIt depends on the scope of the ruling. If it\u2019s narrow, like \u2018I don\u2019t think Time Warner content is that must-have,\u2019 that may have implications in a similar merger in the telecommunications space but may not have a drastic effect in other vertical mergers,\u201d said Caroline Holland, who was in the Antitrust Division during the administration of former President Barack Obama.  A big win for the Justice Department would send shudders down the spines of M&A bankers pursuing deals where a company seeks to merge with a supplier.  Already one deal depends on the ruling: Comcast Corp CMCSA.O said in May that it was preparing a higher, all-cash offer for most of the media assets of Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA.O, but sources say it will only proceed if AT&T wins its case.  Two other vertical deals under review are Cigna Corp's CI.N plan to buy Express Scripts Holding Co ESRX.O for $52 billion and CVS Health Corp's CVS.N planned merger with Aetna Inc AET.N for $69 billion.  Ahead of the court ruling, a top antitrust official at the Justice Department urged investors not to read too much into the decision to sue to stop AT&T from buying Time Warner.  Most proposed transactions were either good for consumers or neutral, said Makan Delrahim, the assistant attorney general for antitrust.  \u201cI understand that some journalists and observers have recently expressed concern that the antitrust division no longer believes that vertical mergers can be efficient and beneficial to competition and consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cRest assured these concerns are misplaced.\u201d","264":"March 21 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc:  * AT&T INC SAYS TO CLOSE ADDITIONAL AT&T STORES ACROSS U.S., SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING RETAIL FOOTPRINT TO A MINIMUM NUMBER OF LOCATIONS Further company coverage:","265":"The company logo for AT&T is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 18, 2019.

FILE PHOTO: An AT&T logo is pictured in Pasadena, California, U.S., January 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni\/File Photo  The service, to be anchored by HBO, will include everything from film classics like \u201cCasablanca\u201d to the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d and \u201cBatman\u201d franchises to TV series \u201cER\u201d and \u201cPretty Little Liars.\u201d  It is still in the planning phases and AT&T, the No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier, has not yet articulated how it will be structured or how it will be staffed.  The announcement of the service delivers on a promise AT&T made in June after shareholders approved the telecom company\u2019s $85 billion purchase of Time Warner in order to make more money selling products directly to consumers rather than just go through middlemen such as cable companies.  \u201cWhen we first discussed the benefits of combining WarnerMedia with AT&T, we saw the ability to create new consumer choices centered on unmatched options, value, quality, and experiences,\u201d John Stankey, WarnerMedia Chief Executive, wrote in the memo.  But Stankey envisions a service that appears broader and more ambitious than just a repository for WarnerMedia-branded programming. In an interview, he said that over time he hoped to create a platform in which other companies would be \u201ca part of the family.\u201d  The strategy, which appears to resemble Hulu, a subscription video service in which AT&T owns about 10 percent along with partners Walt Disney Co and Comcast Corp, follows a similar philosophy to AT&T\u2019s plans to create an advertising platform for the TV industry.  The advertising business, recently renamed Xandr, a nod to telecoms company\u2019s founder Alexander Graham Bell, aims to create a marketplace to buy TV advertising that mimics the targeting abilities of internet advertising. Cable companies Altice USA and Frontier Communications have signed on.  Over time, Stankey said he expects to introduce advertising support content as well.  AT&T plans to finance the new service through \u201cincremental efficiencies\u201d at WarnerMedia, the company said in an SEC regulatory filing on Wednesday.  Stankey said he sees either bundling other WarnerMedia services or folding smaller services into the new product.  The company has also not yet set a price.  The announcement answers a few questions about how it plans to take on rivals Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc which have created thriving businesses streaming movies and shows directly to consumers and Disney. which is spending $71.3 billion on buying Twenty-First Century Fox to do the same.  Media conglomerates including AT&T and Disney have raced to catch up to Netflix which now serves more than 135 million subscribers globally and 58 million in the United States.  In an internal meeting over the summer that was leaked to the press, Stankey, an AT&T veteran, suggested a radical expansion of HBO, which rankled insiders fearful that its new owners would destroy a brand known for its high quality.  The launch of a new service that is expected to be bundled with but not exist as a division of HBO is seen helping to preserve HBO\u2019s reputation as a premium brand which has historically attracted Hollywood\u2019s hottest talent.  The new service will join other WarnerMedia direct to consumer businesses that include the recently launched DC Universe service for comic book and animated series fans and the FilmStruck classic movies service.","268":"June 6 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc's WarnerMedia has dropped its plan for a three-tiered streaming service, the Wall Street Journal reported here on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Under the agreement announced on Thursday, Telefonica will use AT&T\u2019s wireless \u2018last-mile\u2019 equipment - the final link of telecom networks that delivers service to consumers through towers, antennas and fiber-optic cables.  After a three-year transition period, Telefonica will see savings of 230 million euros ($254 million) per year, as well as a reduction in net debt of 500 million euros. Financial terms of the deal with AT&T were not disclosed.  Analysts framed the deal as a lifeline for Telefonica in Mexico, where the company has long struggled to gain traction. Despite a 2013-14 reform intended to lessen its dominance, America Movil still holds nearly two-thirds of mobile lines in Mexico, according to data from telecoms regulator IFT.  AT&T, too, has failed to significantly dent America Movil\u2019s market share since it spent billions to enter the country in 2015 by buying two local carriers.  The agreement will give both Telefonica and AT&T a boost in a brutally competitive market, said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics.  \u201cIt\u2019s the two upstarts going up against the big guy,\u201d Entner said. \u201cYou need to find all the friends that you can when someone has such a dominant position.\u201d  Telefonica Mexico Chief Executive Officer Camilo Aya told reporters the deal with AT&T was not exclusive, meaning the Spanish firm remains free to use other companies\u2019 infrastructure. Telefonica will retain control over its operations, and its traffic will remain separate, he added.  Aya said the agreement was part of a global trend to better position companies against rivals.  \u201cYou need a lot of scale to compete in this business,\u201d Aya said at an event in Mexico City.  Telefonica has been outspoken about the difficulties it has faced in Mexico. Miguel Calderon, vice president of regulation at Telefonica Mexico, said the deal would ensure the firm remained in the country.  The Spanish company has also complained about the cost of spectrum in Mexico, lobbying the government for a discount. After the deal with AT&T is complete, Telefonica will no longer need to pay for spectrum, driving down costs.  Monica Aspe, vice president of external affairs for AT&T Mexico, described the accord as an innovative agreement between telecom companies.  \u201cWhat this agreement does is strengthen the ability to compete,\u201d she said.","270":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission on Friday said it was directing broadcast station groups to go to the negotiating table over whether to allow local stations to air on AT&T Inc\u2019s DirectTV after some consumers have been without access for five months.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  In June, AT&T filed a bad faith complaint against nine individual station owners, which collectively pulled 20 stations in 17 cities from DIRECTV, DIRECTV NOW and\/or U-verse. The nine station groups are either managed or controlled by Sinclair Broadcast Group, AT&T said.  One of these owners controls three ABC, CBS, NBC or FOX affiliates; another has two, and five owners have one. AT&T said it has reached agreement with three of the nine broadcasters named in the complaint.  AT&T reached settlements with two of the groups, while the FCC said the seven remaining broadcast station groups \u201cviolated the per se good faith negotiation standards\u201d and cited repeated delays by the negotiator for the owners in agreeing to talks. \u201cThis is the most egregious example of delay that we have encountered since the good faith rules were adopted,\u201d the FCC said.  Sinclair said the \u201cmatter is between these licensees and the FCC. We have no involvement in these negotiations.\u201d  AT&T said the \u201cFCC ruling that the broadcast station groups\u2019 behavior was a violation of its rules shows again that the entire retransmission consent process is broken and demands immediate reform.\u201d  The company added it was \u201cclearly one of the more egregious examples of how broadcasters routinely hold consumers hostage into paying higher and higher retrans fees, rather than being stewards of the public airwaves.\u201d  In October, Sinclair said it had reached a multiyear agreement across DIRECTV, AT&T TV and U-verse for continued use of Sinclair\u2019s owned local broadcast stations and other programming, including the Tennis Channel and a regional sports network featuring Chicago Cubs games launching in 2020.  The dispute comes as Congress is considering whether to reauthorize the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act (STELAR), a law governing the retransmission of broadcast television by satellite companies. If the law is not extended, the FCC will lose authority to enforce \u201cgood faith\u201d rules with regard to retransmission consent.  On Wednesday, the Senate Commerce Committee plans to take up the bill introduced by the panel\u2019s chair, Roger Wicker.  \u201cIf Congress does not renew STELAR this year, these broadcaster TV blackouts will increase in frequency,\u201d AT&T said.","271":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The judge who will decide if AT&T will be allowed to buy movie and TV show maker Time Warner indicated on Monday that he could be considering a decision that wasn\u2019t a clear approval or blocking of the $85 billion deal.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  In his closing remarks, U.S. Justice Department lawyer Craig Conrath asked for the planned transaction to be stopped. \u201cConsumers will be worse off and that\u2019s why this merger ought to be blocked,\u201d he said. In the absence of blocking it, Conrath urged the judge to consider a divestiture, or asset sale.  Judge Richard Leon asked about the possibility of imposing a remedy, like saying the deal could go forward if the companies sell a particular asset. Conrath said that if the judge found the deal to be anti-competitive then he could impose a fix or a remedy.  In his summation, Daniel Petrocelli, speaking for AT&T and Time Warner, argued against any ruling that would, for example, require AT&T to sell DirecTV, which has more than 20 million subscribers, in order to purchase Time Warner. \u201cThat is an effort to kill the deal,\u201d he said.  Leon said that he would likely have a decision on June 12.  The judge\u2019s decision will guide dealmakers on how aggressive they can be with \u2018vertical mergers\u2019, where one company buys another in the same industry but operating at a different point in the supply chain. Regulators approve the vast majority of vertical deals.  \u2018FAILURE OF PROOF\u2019  In his closing remarks, Petrocelli argued that the government had failed to prove that the merger was illegal because they had not shown that it would lead to higher prices.  \u201cWe have a complete failure of proof,\u201d he said at one point. He argued that the deal would mean half a billion dollars per year in price decreases for pay TV subscribers.  He also criticized a report by economist Carl Shapiro, who has testified that the deal would cost consumers more money because AT&T would have the incentive to withhold Time Warner content like CNN or March Madness basketball from pay TV rivals, both pricey cable companies and cheaper online startups.  And Petrocelli argued that an arbitration offer given by AT&T would take away much of the power to raise prices. In hopes of preventing a court fight, AT&T proposed that for seven years it would submit to third-party arbitration any disagreement with distributors over the pricing for Time Warner\u2019s networks and promise not to black out programming during arbitration.  In his final argument, the Justice Department\u2019s Conrath told the court that AT&T\u2019s Chief Executive Randall Stephenson, who said it was \u201cabsurd\u201d that they would withhold content from competitors, also wrote an email to Time Warner\u2019s chief executive Jeff Bewkes to complain after Time Warner took a stake in Hulu, a cheaper online competitor.  \u201c\u2018It\u2019s hard to imagine how it won\u2019t impact all of our relationships,\u2019\u201d Conrath quoted Stephenson as writing.  Referring to DirecTV, Conrath said that AT&T \u201cwanted to preserve that \u2018cash cow\u2019 for as long as they can.\u201d DirecTV lost 187,000 traditional U.S. video customers in the first quarter of 2018.  Two key witnesses at the trial were Stephenson and Bewkes, who is retiring if the transaction goes through. Both were present for the closing arguments, and Stephenson shook Petrocelli\u2019s hand during a break after his summation.  The two executives argued in the trial that marrying AT&T\u2019s granular information about customers with Time Warner\u2019s ability to create compelling video would allow the merged company to advertise more effectively, giving it a fighting chance to compete with internet advertising titans like Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google.","272":"(Reuters) - AT&T Inc T.N plans to cut more than 3,400 technician and clerical jobs across the country over the next few weeks, the wireless carrier told its main labor union, the Communications Workers of America, on Tuesday.

REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson (L) and REUTERS\/Stephanie Keith\/File Photos  The publication of the closing briefs from both sides brings to end the trial over a deal which took on broader political significance immediately after it was announced in October 2016.  President Donald Trump, a frequent critic of Time Warner\u2019s CNN network, attacked the deal on the campaign trail last year, vowing that as president the Justice Department would block it.  Last week, a Justice Department attorney said Judge Richard Leon should consider requiring AT&T to make a \u201cpartial divestiture.\u201d  The Justice Department had urged AT&T last year to divest either DirecTV, the largest pay TV company with more than 20 million subscribers, or TimeWarner\u2019s Turner networks because the government said AT&T could use Time Warner content as a \u201cweapon\u201d to raise prices.  The Justice Department had demanded divestitures because it argued that ATT would have the ability to raise prices on Time Warner content for pay TV rivals.  \u201cDivestitures here would destroy the very consumer value this merger is designed to unlock. Divesting DirecTV would eliminate the price decrease for millions of DirecTV consumers predicted by the government itself, and divesting Turner would eliminate the content innovations and the advertising benefits that put downward pressure on Turner prices,\u201d the company said in a court filing.  Leon is expected to decide by June 12 whether to approve the merger. The Justice Department has said it is illegal because consumers would end up paying more for television while AT&T and Time Warner say they need the deal to compete with internet titans like Facebook Inc and Netflix Inc  \u201cThe government did not even begin to make a credible case that the merger would likely harm competition, substantially or even just a little,\u201d AT&T said in its closing brief. \u201cThis is not a close case. The government failed to meet its burden for multiple independent reasons.\u201d  The Justice Department\u2019s final brief was filed under seal late Thursday and a redacted version has not yet been made public.  The government argued the deal would mean that consumers will pay more since AT&T could elect to raise prices for Time Warner content to other pay TV companies, like Charter Communications or Cox. The Justice Department has also said that AT&T could refuse to license the content to new, cheaper online services.  AT&T, for its part, has argued that Time Warner\u2019s licensing fees were too valuable for the company to forego. Time Warner reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue in late April, an increase of 10 percent to $3.34 billion, because of advertisers associated with college basketball games.  AT&T sought to assuage critics by offering to submit to third-party arbitration any disagreement with distributors over the pricing for Time Warner\u2019s networks and to promise not to black out programing during arbitration. The offer is good for seven years.  Judge Leon, who asked few questions during the trial, asked witnesses several times if they felt the arbitration proposal was adequate.  Leon rejected a request by AT&T to force the Justice Department to turn over records that could have shed light on whether Trump pressured the Justice Department to try to block the deal.","278":"May 27 (Reuters) - AT&T\u2019s WarnerMedia division launches its HBO Max streaming service on Wednesday, taking on Netflix, Disney and Amazon at a time when coronavirus lockdowns have boosted demand for streaming even as rising unemployment has cut disposable incomes.  HBO Max launches to a captive audience stuck at home without access to theater, live music, shopping excursions or live or televised sporting events. That situation helped Netflix Inc sign up 15.8 million new paying customers in the first three months of the year, more than double what it expected to attract.  But with film and TV productions halted across the globe, HBO has postponed dozens of releases - most notably a \u201cFriends\u201d reunion special originally planned for launch. If HBO Max does not resume production by this fall, the service could start to see a shortage of original content as early as January, according to a source familiar with the company.  At $15 per month, the service is more expensive than both the $7 per month Disney+ streaming service and the $13 per month standard Netflix plan. Still, WarnerMedia hopes to reach about 80 million global HBO Max subscribers by 2025.  Many existing HBO subscribers in the United States will not need to do anything to get the new service, as WarnerMedia revised deals with distributors including Apple Inc, Charter Communications Inc, Hulu and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and YouTube TV.  But subscribers of HBO through Comcast Corp, Amazon.com Inc and Roku Inc are out of luck as WarnerMedia has yet to strike new agreements.  For these and new customers, WarnerMedia is offering a promotion for subscribing directly with the company: $3 off the regular $15 price. Some AT&T customers will also get it at no additional cost.  HBO Max will feature 10,000 hours of content from WarnerMedia brands and libraries such as Warner Bros, New Line Cinema and Cartoon Network. At launch it will include six original titles, including \u201cLove Life,\u201d a romantic comedy anthology series featuring Anna Kendrick, and a Sesame Workshop children\u2019s show \u201cThe Not Too Late Show with Elmo.\u201d  More original programming will come over time, including the DC Comics film \u201cJustice League,\u201d recut by director Zack Snyder.

REUTERS\/Stephanie Keith  NEW YORK\/WASHINGTON (Reuters Breakingviews) - This time AT&T got the law right. A judge cleared the telecom firm\u2019s $85 billion Time Warner purchase, handing the U.S. Department of Justice a comprehensive defeat. It\u2019s a win for Chief Executive Randall Stephenson, but it could come with a winner\u2019s curse.  U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon not only blessed the union with no strings attached, he urged Donald Trump\u2019s antitrust enforcers not to seek a stay while they decide whether to appeal. Doing so, he said, would be \u201cmanifestly unjust\u201d since the deadline for closing the deal falls next week.  Regulators argued that the tie-up would hurt consumers because AT&T would have an advantage over rival distributors that wanted access to Time Warner content, like HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d for example. AT&T said the deal would help it better compete with other giants like Facebook and Alphabet\u2019s Google for digital-advertising dollars.  The DOJ was pushing the envelope, given the two companies involved don\u2019t have any real business overlaps. And there isn\u2019t much history of actual trials, because most companies walk away from deals that are challenged or agree to concessions. Comcast, for example, accepted restrictions protecting other distributors of content in its acquisition of NBC Universal.  Stephenson tried seven years ago to buy smaller cellphone rival T-Mobile US. The government sued to block the deal and T-Mobile walked away with as much as $6 billion worth of cash and spectrum. The AT&T CEO could ill afford another big legal setback. Now, though, he has to make something of Time Warner\u2019s assets, including HBO, the Warner Bros movie studio and news network CNN.  AT&T\u2019s shares fell 2 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday following the decision. That may be an early indication that it won\u2019t all be plain sailing. The company has never produced content before and will be new to the challenges of managing creative talent and spotting the next GoT-style blockbuster. Netflix, Amazon and Apple are spending billions on TV shows and movies. That makes it tough to slash costs enough to justify the hefty premium being paid. AT&T may come to regret its victory.","286":"WASHINGTON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court upheld on Tuesday a lower court ruling that wireless and satellite TV provider AT&T Inc\u2019s deal to buy content maker Time Warner for $85.4 billion was legal under antitrust law.

An AT&T logo is seen at an AT&T store in New York City, October 23, 2016. REUTERS\/Stephanie Keith  The second-largest U.S. wireless carrier has been reducing its dependency on the phone business with its $85-billion acquisition of Time Warner this year, but it is struggling to grow in the TV market as its satellite business continues to shed customers, while its streaming services have not attracted as many subscribers as analysts had hoped.  AT&T lost more satellite TV customers than Wall Street expected in the third quarter, shedding a net 359,000 subscribers, as viewers move to services like Netflix Inc and Hulu. It lost 251,000 in the same period last year.  Wall Street analysts expected AT&T to shed 245,000 satellite subscribers, according to research firm FactSet.  Meanwhile, DirecTV Now, the company\u2019s \u201cover-the-top\u201d streaming video service that was launched to lure back viewers who had dropped more expensive satellite TV services, added only 49,000 net subscribers in the quarter, much lower than the 296,000 it added last year. Analysts had expected 287,000 net new customers, according to FactSet.  \u201cSatellite TV subscriber losses are accelerating while over-the-top subscription growth has stalled,\u201d said Walter Piecyk, an analyst with BTIG Research.  AT&T has pared back promotional offers for DirecTV Now to focus on reaching profitability, executives said on a conference call to discuss earnings.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re after is customers who are highly engaged, find the product compelling and use it a lot,\u201d said AT&T Communications Chief Executive John Donovan during the call. \u201cThat will lend [DirecTV Now] towards being able to be supplemented by an ad model over time.\u201d  In response to an analyst question about the pay TV business\u2019s contribution to a recovery in the company\u2019s entertainment group, Donovan corrected the analyst and said the recovery would come from the group\u2019s broadband business, implying it would not come from the video business that includes DirecTV.  AT&T shares were down 6.1 percent at $31.01 early Wednesday afternoon.  PHONE SUBSCRIBERS UP  AT&T gained a net 69,000 phone subscribers in the United States who pay a monthly bill, compared with analysts\u2019 estimates of a net drop of 22,000 subscribers, according to research firm FactSet.  Wall Street analysts watch the so-called \u201cpostpaid\u201d subscriber figure because those customers pay a monthly bill and are more valuable to the company.  The new WarnerMedia segment, which includes Turner and premium TV channel HBO, reported revenue of $8.2 billion during the quarter. It did not provide a year-ago figure.  AT&T closed its purchase of Time Warner on June 14 after winning a court battle against the U.S. Department of Justice, which argued that AT&T-owned DirecTV would use Time Warner content to raise costs for pay TV rivals.  A U.S. appeals court said last week it will hear oral arguments on Dec. 6 for the Justice Department\u2019s appeal against the merger.  WarnerMedia recently announced it will introduce a new subscription video service by the end of 2019, anchored by HBO. Within a year, the service will also include original content, WarnerMedia Chief Executive John Stankey previously told Reuters.  Third-quarter net income attributable to AT&T rose to $4.7 billion, or 65 cents per share, from $3.0 billion, or 49 cents per share a year earlier.  Excluding some items, the company earned 90 cents per share, missing analysts\u2019 estimate of 94 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data.

Walt Disney Co\u2019s Disney+ has more than 60 million subscribers, reaching its goal four years early.  Adjusted earnings per share were 76 cents, matching analyst expectations.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Carl Shapiro, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley, said the planned $85.4 billion merger would give AT&T, which owns satellite and streaming television provider DirecTV, leverage to charge more for Time Warner\u2019s Turner family of channels, which includes sports content and CNN.  It would also give AT&T the opportunity to coordinate with Comcast Corp CMCSA.O, which owns NBCU, to starve cheaper online video companies of content, he said.  Shapiro is expected to be the government\u2019s last witness as it seeks to show that the proposed merger is illegal under antitrust law because it would raise pay TV costs to consumers. The government filed a lawsuit in November and is asking U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon to block the deal.  Following Shapiro, AT&T\u2019s lawyers are expected to call their own economist, Dennis Carlton of the University of Chicago.  Shapiro testified that AT&T\u2019s ownership of DirecTV means that it will likely raise rates for content when it negotiates contracts with other cable and satellite companies, and will be more willing to let contracts lapse so DirecTV could win over irritated subscribers when the rival \u201cgoes dark.\u201d  Blackouts mattered, he said. \u201cEven though they don\u2019t happen very much, that\u2019s the key to leverage,\u201d he said.  Leon noted that a Comcast executive said in testimony that when its content subsidiary NBCU negotiates with rivals that it does not consider a blackout of a rival a way for Comcast to win new subscribers.  \u201cThat\u2019s what they say. Is that correct? Do you have a different understanding?\u201d he asked.  Shapiro noted that companies tend to function as one entity rather than parts. NBCU\u2019s strategy of steering clear of a blackout \u201cwould not be in the combined interest of the company. They would be leaving money on the table,\u201d he said.  On cross examination, Daniel Petrocelli, a lawyer for AT&T and Time Warner, pressed Shapiro on why he did not factor into his model an arbitration offer made by AT&T that would prevent blackout.  He also questioned other aspects of the government expert\u2019s report.  The trial, which began in mid-March in the U.S. District Court in Washington, is expected to wrap up this month.","297":"June 7 (Reuters) - Dish Network Corp is open to merging its satellite television business with AT&T Inc\u2019s pay TV service DirecTV, CNBC reported, citing a media report.

The U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s total loss in court batters the tough but savvy reputation earned years ago under President Barack Obama. Flimsy legal theories flummoxed experts while stalling other possible deals like a Comcast bid for assets of Twenty-First Century Fox. After Tuesday\u2019s court decision, the watchdog can expect fresh charges of putting politics over the law.  Chief Executive Officer of AT&T Randall Stephenson speaks during a press conference in New York City, New York, U.S. November 20, 2017. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  Federal Judge Richard Leon\u2019s ruling allowing the $85 billion merger to proceed was, in legal terms, a slam dunk. His refusal even to impose any conditions on the deal vindicates serious doubts about whether the challenge should have ever been brought.  The Justice Department hasn\u2019t sued to block this kind of transaction \u2013 a so-called vertical merger \u2013 since 1977, when it failed to squelch Hammermill Paper\u2019s acquisition of two distributors. Combining companies in different, if complementary, businesses just doesn\u2019t raise the anticompetitive concerns of horizontal mergers, which involve direct rivals and might result in raised prices or reduced quality if they are allowed to combine.  AT&T, essentially a distributor of shows and other content, and Time Warner, a content creator, overlap in the horizontal sense only to the extent of AT&T\u2019s indirect stake in MLB Network and a few similar channels. Otherwise, this was a classic vertical merger that the companies argued would strengthen competition against tech giants like Amazon and Netflix.  Trump\u2019s trustbusters disagreed, contending the combined firm might charge cable competitors more for HBO and other Time Warner content, withhold programming over pricing disputes and undermine emerging online alternative distributors like Sling TV. That was always a stretch, considering that Time Warner derives about half of its revenue from fees charged to an array of distributors and denying them content could eat into those sales. And nothing about the merger seemed to make higher prices likelier than they were before the transaction. What\u2019s more, Justice Department projections of the deal\u2019s cost to consumers proved significantly exaggerated at trial.  DOJ antitrust boss Makan Delrahim tried to calm fears and confusion over his aggressive tack with assurances that \u201cour approach to vertical mergers has not changed ... most vertical mergers are procompetitive or competitively neutral.\u201d Yet targeting the AT&T-Time Warner deal injected damaging uncertainty into the market. For example, it handed the Fox board, which had agreed to a $52 billion asset sale to Walt Disney, an excuse to dismiss a competing and perhaps superior bid from Comcast because of \u201cregulatory risks.\u201d  The real damage, though, may have been done to the Justice Department itself. After weak efforts under President George W. Bush, antitrust enforcers flexed their muscles under the Obama administration, gunning down major beer, hospital and airline deals. Pummeling the likes of food-service giants Sysco and US Foods at trial gave the DOJ credibility in court. The clear message that department lawyers would go to the mat killed, for example, General Electric\u2019s sale of its stoves, cook-tops and ovens business to Sweden\u2019s Electrolux. Even overreaches such as a challenge to the merger between US Airways and American Airlines parent AMR ended in face-saving settlements.  Critics of Obama\u2019s antitrust enforcers might say they had a strong track record only because they played it safe \u2013 or, more charitably, knew how to pick their spots \u2013 and that Delrahim was at least trying to get more aggressive. Even allowing an element of that, the AT&T case was a bad call. The current watchdogs have now largely squandered their department\u2019s hard-earned credibility \u2013 and with a lawsuit whose origins always raised questions.  In 2016, then-candidate Trump had already slammed Time Warner-owned CNN as \u201cfake news\u201d and said his administration would not approve an AT&T merger with Time Warner \u201cbecause it\u2019s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\u201d He and Delrahim have denied any White House pressure, but it\u2019s reasonable to wonder how else such a boneheaded legal move could have happened.  The potential harm is serious. Even the perception of weakness could skew the give-and-take over future antitrust enforcement in favor of companies. Dealmakers may take threats to block mergers less seriously and trustbusters might more readily back down, fearing another embarrassing loss. Dodgy deals could go unchallenged. What\u2019s more, judges may now view the government\u2019s allegations of antitrust violations with greater skepticism.  These developments come as legitimate concerns are brewing over vertical combinations that create tightly integrated companies. Thanks to the influence of Yale law professor Robert Bork, current U.S. antitrust law says size doesn\u2019t matter as much as competitive pricing and efficiency. Yet the rise and influence of Alphabet\u2019s Google, Amazon and other mega-firms has cast doubt on that proposition, especially in the media industry: Unlike Hammermill paper products, shows like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d are not fungible.  As Europe has already acknowledged, sheer size may alone amount to a sort of market power. Exactly how has not been tested recently in American courts, and it probably deserves to be. The Justice Department\u2019s failure to show that it\u2019s up to the task may be the real significance of this week\u2019s loss in court.","305":"WASHINGTON, Nov 11 (Reuters) - When Democrats take control of the U.S. House they plan to investigate the Trump administration\u2019s decision to try to block AT&T Inc from acquiring Time Warner, and whether officials sought to punish Amazon.com Inc by prodding the U.S. Post Office to hike shipping prices for the world\u2019s largest e-commerce company, a senior Democrat said on Sunday.

The Justice Department filed a lawsuit in November to stop the U.S. No. 2 wireless carrier, which owns DirecTV and other services with 25 million subscribers, from buying movie and TV show maker Time Warner, which owns HBO and CNN.  The government is arguing a deal would hike a subscriber\u2019s monthly cable bill by 45 cents and raise prices for rival cable and online video distributors.  AT&T denies that prices would rise and plans to argue the deal is necessary for it to compete with new media companies like Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Netflix Inc, according to court documents filed before the trial.  AT&T rejected settlement offers from the Justice Department, including government proposals to shed either its DirecTV division or Time Warner\u2019s Turner Broadcasting assets, which include CNN.  Opening arguments are set for Wednesday after up to two days of hearings to consider objections on a number of motions.  AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson, Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes and programming executives from rival companies are expected to testify during the trial that Judge Richard Leon has estimated would last six to eight weeks.  Looming over the trial is the question of whether U.S. President Donald Trump, who criticized the deal on the campaign trail and again as president, may have influenced the Justice Department\u2019s decision to oppose the transaction.  AT&T lawyers have said the Time Warner deal may have been singled out for enforcement, citing Trump\u2019s statements that the deal was bad for consumers and the country.  Leon last month rejected a bid by AT&T to force the government to disclose any White House communications that AT&T lawyers believe may have shed light on the matter. AT&T did not raise any arguments relating to Trump in its final pretrial brief filed earlier this month.  The outcome of the AT&T\/Time Warner case could affect other pending \u201cvertical\u201d mergers, in which different parts of a supply chain, rather than rivals in the same business, join together.

The move makes AT&T, which has a market capitalization of $270 billion, one of the three largest companies after Apple and Microsoft to be targeted by activist shareholders, who prod management to make changes by selling off units, buying back shares or adding board members. U.S. President Donald Trump, a frequent critic of U.S. cable news channel CNN, which is owned by AT&T, called Elliott\u2019s announcement \u201cgreat news.\u201d  The New York-based hedge fund, one of the world\u2019s most successful activists, wrote to Dallas-headquartered AT&T on Monday morning, sending a four-part proposal that it said could help lift its stock price by at least 60% by the end of 2021.  The plan ranges from divesting certain businesses, eliminating $5 billion in costs, reviewing how it allocates capital and urging CEO Randall Stephenson, who has led the company since the financial crisis, to stop making acquisitions.  \u201cAT&T has been an outlier in terms of its M&A strategy: Most companies today no longer seek to assemble conglomerates,\u201d the letter said.  Elliott also may push for new directors with operating skills and domain expertise to join the company\u2019s 13-member board, and it noted that investors have previously raised concerns that Stephenson holds both the CEO and chairman titles.  News of Elliott\u2019s stake helped push AT&T\u2019s stock price up more than 4% to a high of $37.78, its peak for the year, though by midday on Monday the gain was 2.7%. AT&T said it would engage with Elliott and review the firm\u2019s views.  For Elliott, which invests some $38 billion in assets and has been working on the investment for over a year, AT&T marks one of its biggest corporate targets to date.  There are some similarities with last year's campaign against Sempra Energy SRE.N, when Elliott also highlighted a conglomerate strategy that it said had failed and cost shareholders considerable cash.  But there are differences as well, with some analysts saying that Elliott had learned lessons on how to approach its targets after the Sempra campaign where it asked for six board seats and settled for two that both sides agreed to.  At AT&T, Elliott struck a conciliatory tone at the start of its letter, calling the company one of the world\u2019s most important companies before critiquing its strategy, leadership and sluggish share price. It stopped short of asking for a specific number of seats and naming the people who might fill them.  People familiar with the situation suggested negotiations between the hedge fund and company may occur quickly and be resolved relatively soon as other shareholders are also concerned by the company\u2019s lack of stock market gains.  CRITICISM OF BIG DEALS  Elliott took aim at AT&T\u2019s $85 billion acquisition of media company TimeWarner Inc last year and the $49 billion purchase of satellite television provider DirecTV in 2015.  \u201cDespite nearly 600 days passing between signing and closing (and more than a year passing since), AT&T has yet to articulate a clear strategic rationale for why AT&T needs to own Time Warner,\u201d Elliott said in a letter to the company\u2019s board of directors.  The TimeWarner acquisition gave it control of HBO and CNN and took more than two years to close, as it was heavily scrutinized by antitrust authorities and even questioned by Trump.  Elliott did not offer details on any missteps it saw in the deal, but said it remained cautious about the benefits of the combination that also brought the TBS and TNT networks, as well as the Warner Bros film studio, producer of the \u201cBatman\u201d and \u201cHarry Potter\u201d films, under AT&T.  FILE PHOTO: The AT&T logo is pictured during the Forbes Forum 2017 in Mexico City, Mexico, September 18, 2017.

The hedge fund listed businesses, including home security, DirecTV, regional sports networks, CME, Sky Mexico, its Latin American pay TV business (Vrio), Puerto Rican operations and other units as possible sale candidates.  It said AT&T should also appoint third-party advisers to evaluate its operations and organizational structure, with a focus on eliminating inefficiency and creating a faster-moving organization.  AT&T has missed revenue expectations five times in the past eight quarters, according to Refinitiv data.

The company said it has overtaken AT&T across postpaid, in which customers pay a recurring monthly bill, and prepaid phones - customers paying for service in advance.  T-Mobile reported 98.3 million customers in those categories, while AT&T had nearly 93 million postpaid and prepaid subscribers in its second quarter.  Subscriber figures between U.S. carriers can be difficult to compare given the variety of plans offered. AT&T declined to comment.  T-Mobile added 253,000 net new phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill, compared with 710,000 additions a year earlier.  Analysts had expected 169,200 new subscribers, according to research firm FactSet.

T-Mobile said during the earnings call with analysts that more than 10% of network traffic from Sprint\u2019s postpaid customers have been migrated to T-Mobile.

As a result of the contract dispute and after months of negotiations over retransmission fees, CBS stations went dark for more than 6.5 million DirecTV, DirecTV Now and AT&T U-verse customers in at least 14 U.S. cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.  The agreement includes retransmission consent for all 26 CBS-owned stations in 17 markets including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco, the companies said.  The companies did not disclose the terms of the agreement.  The two sides negotiated over pricing, as well as whether AT&T could sell CBS\u2019 All-Access streaming service as a separate option and whether CBS would be required to produce programming such as the Grammy Awards in a higher-than-typical 4K resolution, according to sources familiar with the negotiations.  They also negotiated on whether CBS would provide AT&T with past episodes and entire seasons of shows, and whether CBS content would be available to all DirecTV consumers, according to the sources.  CBS is one of several networks - including sibling company Viacom, A&E Networks (owned jointly by Hearst Networks and the Walt Disney Co.) and Nexstar - to publicly feud with AT&T over contract negotiations this year.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar  Stankey will take over on July 1 from Randall Stephenson, who said on Friday he will retire from the CEO position but will serve as executive chairman of the board until January 2021.  The announcement, made during AT&T\u2019s virtual annual shareholder meeting, drew a sharp response from U.S. President Donald Trump, who tweeted it was \u201cgreat news\u201d that Stephenson was leaving.  \u201cAnyone who lets a garbage \u201cnetwork\u201d do and say the things that CNN does, should leave ASAP. Hopefully replacement will be much better!\u201d he wrote.  Stankey oversaw WarnerMedia after AT&T\u2019s $85 billion purchase of media company Time Warner, as well as the creation of HBO Max, the new streaming service that will launch May 27. He was also promoted to COO last year.  The success of HBO Max will be a big test of Stankey's role as AT&T hopes to compete with streaming giants like Netflix IncNFLX.O and Walt Disney Co'sDIS.N Disney+.  AT&T, which faced some criticism from HBO fans and the creative community, is betting the service can achieve wider appeal with hit shows like \u201cFriends\u201d while hanging onto more sophisticated audiences with \u201cSuccession\u201d and similar shows.  AT&T\u2019s board reviewed both external and internal candidates for the CEO role as part of a succession planning process started in 2017, Stephenson said.  \u201cAfter an extensive evaluation, it was clear that John Stankey was the right person to lead AT&T into the future,\u201d he said.  New York-based activist investor Elliott Management called for a shake-up at AT&T last fall, urging the company to end its buying spree and improve its operating businesses. The hedge fund also questioned Stankey\u2019s leadership skills and AT&T\u2019s desire to promote him to the top role.  By late October, AT&T struck a truce with Elliott and unveiled a three-year plan that included selling up to $10 billion worth of businesses, paying off debt and adding two new board members.  Elliott said Friday it supports Stankey\u2019s appointment to CEO.  \u201cWe have been engaged with the company throughout the search process, which was a robust one, including a range of highly qualified outside candidates and overseen by independent directors,\u201d said Jesse Cohen, a partner at Elliott Management. \u201cWe look forward to working with John as he begins his term as CEO.\u201d  A continuing challenge for Stankey will be to stitch together AT&T\u2019s media business with its phone, TV and internet products, to create an advertising powerhouse. Brian Lesser, who led AT&T advertising unit Xandr, resigned last month.  \u201cMy commitment is, you\u2019ll get my best from me every day,\u201d Stankey said.

FILE PHOTO: Logos and trading information for AT&T and Time Warner are displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., June 13, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  After overcoming the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s objection that the deal would harm competition, AT&T, the country\u2019s number two wireless operator, said it will use its technology to reinvent how consumers receive and view entertainment.  A major aim is to reduce the number of commercials now that customers are accustomed to ad-free services such as Netflix Inc NFLX.O, said John Stankey, chief executive of newly named AT&T unit WarnerMedia.  \u201cOne of the big benefits we can bring to the market is lighter ad loads,\u201d Stankey told Reuters in an interview.  AT&T, long dominant in the U.S. telephone industry, is now at the forefront of Hollywood with its purchase of Time Warner, which owned HBO, the Warner Brothers film and television studios, and Turner Broadcasting and CNN.  AT&T plans to use mobile phone and video data, supplied by customers who have given permission, to sell targeted advertisements. The thinking is that brands will pay more if they know their message is reaching someone likely to be interested in it.  For example, \u201cif I\u2019m a beer drinker, I\u2019m more interested in seeing things about beer than soft drinks,\u201d Stankey said.  Some of Time Warner\u2019s Turner networks already have cut the number of commercials. Comedy network TruTV, for example, has reduced ad time by roughly 50 percent.  AT&T \u201cabsolutely\u201d should be able to further reduce ad inventory across Turner networks, Stankey said.  AUTOMATED MARKETPLACE  The company will start selling targeted ads for Turner networks such as TNT and CNN \u201cin short order,\u201d Stankey said.  An industry-wide, automated marketplace, which would sell ads across other companies\u2019 channels, would require cooperation across multiple players, and Stankey acknowledged that remains \u201ceasily a year off.\u201d  The Justice Department and other critics had argued that AT&T\u2019s purchase of Time Warner would harm consumers by limiting competition and leading to price increases. But a U.S. judge disagreed, and AT&T completed the merger last week. The government still may appeal.  AT&T now owns popular properties such as \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d along with the Harry Potter and Wonder Woman franchises. In the coming days, it will launch AT&T Watch, a package of Turner networks plus some from other media companies, Stankey said.  Designed as a general entertainment package that is smaller than traditional cable bundles, AT&T Watch will not carry sports-specific networks, Stankey said.  AT&T also plans to tailor programing to customer interests, such as by sending CNN news clips to mobile phone users based on their interests, or alerts about types of programing they might like based on earlier viewing, Stankey said.  Customers of HBO\u2019s online services should not expect any immediate change to the company\u2019s stance on password sharing, Stankey said. HBO limits the number of simultaneous streams but has accepted that some password sharing will occur.  AT&T is comfortable with password sharing among family members and believes most cases occur among people with a close relationship to someone who pays for the service, Stankey said.  \u201cIf somebody becomes really passionate about doing something through password sharing, and at some point they get hooked on it, they move into being a paying subscriber,\u201d he said.","324":"(Reuters) - When Randall Stephenson joined 180 of his peers leading many of the richest U.S. companies in signing the Business Roundtable pledge on the \u201cpurpose of a corporation\u201d in August 2019, the then-chief of AT&T Inc promised to look out for the interests of all the wireless carrier\u2019s stakeholders, not just shareholders.  FILE PHOTO: The AT&T logo is pictures on a building in Los Angeles, California, U.S. August 10, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/\/File Photo  Two months later, the Dallas-based company outlined a plan for cost reductions that also prioritized dividends and stock buybacks for shareholders, succumbing to pressure from $41 billion hedge fund Elliott Investment Management LP.  Activist investor Elliott had said its proposals would deliver \u201csubstantial benefits\u201d for shareholders, consumers and employees, but not everybody came out ahead.  By the end of September 2020, AT&T had eliminated 23,000 positions, or about 9% of its workforce, many of them during the pandemic. Already one of the corporate world\u2019s top dividend payers with $14.9 billion spent in 2019, AT&T had raised its common dividend by 2% and bought back $7.5 billion of its stock.  \u201cWe are the face of AT&T and we go out of our way to help customers communicate with their families,\u201d said Darren Miller, a 35-year-old technician whose job was cut last July. \u201cBut we are a dime a dozen to them. If they can get someone cheaper to do the job, they will do it.\u201d  Miller, who worked in Reseda, California, said he accepted a buyout offer after managers told him he might be laid off later on less generous terms, something he said his local union representatives told him happened to dozens of other employees in the state.  AT&T spokesman Jim Kimberly said most of the workforce reductions \u201cwere from voluntary departure offers and attrition\u201d and declined to comment on individual cases. He added the company had for years practiced a \u201cmeaningful commitment to all stakeholders\u201d through programs that include worker retraining and environmental and social justice efforts. AT&T also ended share buybacks once the pandemic hit, and has not increased its dividend since, Kimberly said.  Elliott declined to comment.  Some advocates of a socially-minded stakeholder capitalism say AT&T\u2019s case is representative of the hurdles they face in challenging the leverage investors have over U.S. companies.  The voluntary governance pledge signed by the CEOs didn't spell out specific actions, but had the stated aim of moving away from \"shareholder primacy\". here  Yet while signatories subsequently reduced payouts to shareholders as companies put away cash to shield themselves from the financial fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, they still give a greater share to investors than those companies that did not sign the pledge, according to a Reuters analysis of data compiled by financial information provider Refinitiv.  The analysis found that the 171 publicly traded companies that signed the pledge returned a median 60% of net income to shareholders during the first three quarters of 2020 through dividends and buybacks, versus a 50% return among the 355 S&P 500 firms that did not sign the statement.  By comparison, in the first three quarters of 2019, the signatories returned a median 73% of net income to shareholders versus a 68% return among the firms that did not sign the pledge, the analysis found.  Tim Gaumer, Refinitiv\u2019s director of fundamental research, said pledge signatories returned more to investors because they had the ability to do so. \u201cIt is easier to pay out dividends and buybacks with confidence if your income stream is less volatile,\u201d he added.  Business Roundtable spokeswoman Jessica Boulanger said the analysis didn\u2019t account for how companies spent money they did not return to shareholders, nor for \u201cindustry differences, company size and longevity and trends in shareholder returns over time.\u201d She added that signatories had upheld their commitment to work for all stakeholders.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  (Graphic: Roundtable signatory companies slash buybacks : )  (Graphic: Roundtable signatory dividends hold up Roundtable signatory dividends hold up: )  \u2018SIGNALING EXERCISE\u2019  The CEOs signed the pledge without legally binding their companies and largely without approval from their boards. COVID-19 stress-tested their commitments, as large swathes of the economy were forced to shut down.  The pledge\u2019s lack of detail gave signatories wide discretion in deciding how the pandemic pain would be spread among shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.  \u201cIt\u2019s a political signaling exercise that doesn\u2019t mean very much,\u201d said Harvard Law School professor Jesse Fried, who is on the research advisory council of Glass, Lewis & Co which advises investors over how to vote on corporate governance.  Defenders of the Business Roundtable pledge say many contributions to society cannot be measured as easily as shareholder spending or layoffs. For example, JP Morgan Chase & Co pledged $30 billion to address racial injustices, and Apple Inc launched a $100 million diversity drive.  Indeed, some signatories have won praise from progressive-leaning organizations for standing by employees during the pandemic.  Among them, Target Corp raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour in July from $13, which was already well above the $7.25 national level.  Some executives and investors argue that unless companies are attractive to shareholders and keep their stock highly valued, they won\u2019t have the money to invest in their businesses for the benefit of all stakeholders.  \u201cIf you don\u2019t have access to capital, then you\u2019re not going to be around long enough to face tough societal issues like climate change,\u201d said Todd Ahlsten, chief investment officer for Parnassus Investments, a San Francisco-based firm with $40 billion under management.  EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATION  Less than two years after the signing of the pledge, key protagonists at AT&T moved on. Stephenson passed the reins to a successor, and Elliott sold what was once a $3.2 billion stake in the company.  AT&T\u2019s layoffs during the pandemic attracted the attention of Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who wrote to the company last July objecting to \u201ccorporations using the pandemic as justification for continuing to make anti-worker decisions that are aimed at boosting share price.\u201d  \u201cThe long-term interests of our communities and employees cannot be met without attracting investor capital,\u201d AT&T executive vice president Timothy McKone responded in a letter.  BlackRock Inc and Vanguard Group Inc, whose CEOs also signed up to the pledge, were among the AT&T investors who voted down a proposal last April to have an employee representative on the company\u2019s board - a step its advocates argued would give stakeholders a voice. Both fund managers declined to comment.  SPENDING ON SHAREHOLDERS  Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania researchers found that among signatories, the bigger share of profits companies subsequently returned to investors, the more likely they were to announce layoffs and furloughs.  A study from the London School of Economics and Columbia University found signatories violated environmental and labor-related rules and paid their CEOs more than similarly-sized peers.  Like AT&T, some companies that signed up continued payouts to shareholders even as they cut jobs during the pandemic.  Cisco Systems Inc bought back $800 million of its shares during the three months ended Oct. 24, 2020. The network equipment maker had announced a restructuring plan in August to cut $1 billion in costs annually, with the loss of about 3,500 jobs.  \u201cCisco believes in the Business Roundtable pledge balancing the needs of all of our stakeholders and fulfilling our own company\u2019s purpose of powering a more inclusive future for all,\u201d the company said in a statement.  Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc repurchased $522 million of its shares from April through July. That month, the pharmacy operator cut 4,000 jobs, some 7% of its headcount, bumped up its dividend and nixed its stock buyback program.  Walgreens did not respond to a request for comment.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit said in an order on Friday that the government would be allowed to release transcripts of the conversations that generally occurred between Judge Richard Leon, who tried the case, and one or more lawyers from the Justice Department, AT&T and Time Warner.  A loud hissing noise was played over the public address system in the court during the conferences to ensure that reporters and others in the courtroom could not hear what was said.  Judge Leon ruled in June that the Justice Department was wrong to ask that a $85.4 billion merger of AT&T, which owns DirecTV, and Time Warner be blocked. The government had said it would lead to higher prices for consumers and was illegal under antitrust law.  The Justice Department has appealed but no date has been set for when the appeals court will hear the case. The deal closed on June 14.  AT&T has said it would manage Time Warner\u2019s Turner cable television networks as part of a separate business unit until February 2019 or the conclusion of the government\u2019s appeal.  The merger, announced in October 2016, was opposed by President Donald Trump.","326":"(Eliminates reference to Fox and adds reference to analyst in last paragraph)  March 22 (Reuters) - Viacom Inc\u2019s bitter contract renewal talks with AT&T Inc\u2019s DirecTV that could see the blackout of MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central by midnight Friday are weighing on a possible tie-up of CBS and Viacom, sources familiar with the discussions said.  Although the boards of CBS and Viacom have not discussed or decided on pursuing a merger, these sources say they are studying AT&T\u2019s impact on Viacom and how it affects the company\u2019s motivation to pursue a CBS merger. Viacom needs to resolve the AT&T contract before considering any other strategic moves including mergers and acquisitions, sources said.  Both companies are controlled by the Redstone family\u2019s National Amusements Inc, which pushed for a merger last year but backed off as CBS explores other options before deciding on another run at Viacom.  Viacom would take a substantial financial hit without an AT&T deal. AT&T is Viacom\u2019s largest distributor, representing 24.5 million total video subscribers, and was responsible for about 15 percent of Viacom\u2019s 2018 revenue. At stake are about $2 billion annually in fees and advertising, which are seen declining in any new deal, according to Wall Street estimates.  The 2017 Viacom and Charter Communications Inc renewal resulted in a 15 percent rate decrease. A similar outcome with AT&T could lead to a $156 million drop in annual affiliate fees paid by AT&T to Viacom, although some analysts have estimated an approximate 10 percent decrease this time.  Viacom and AT&T declined to comment. Negotiations continued as of Friday afternoon, sources said.  Failure to reach a deal is seen emboldening CBS and Viacom\u2019s controlling shareholder\u2019s position to put the companies together to give them better leverage in future distribution contract talks.  \u201cViacom\u2019s clear need for greater negotiating leverage after being dropped by AT&T might be the final factor necessary to drive the long-speculated CBS-Viacom merger given the common control of both companies by the Redstone-controlled National Amusements,\u201d Credit Suisse analyst Doug Mitchelson said in a research note this week.  If AT&T and Viacom walk away from the table, the No. 2 U.S. telecoms company\u2019s position could also be weakened, especially if it faces a combined CBS and Viacom by the end of June, when CBS\u2019s contract with AT&T expires.  Dropping the CBS broadcast network and NFL games would be disastrous to AT&T, and they may end up paying more for Viacom channels through CBS, analysts have said.  Losing Viacom will also weaken AT&T\u2019s leverage as it faces Walt Disney Co later this year, according to Mitchelson.","327":"(Adds Linde, Madrigal Pharma, Cellnex, Education Realty, Comcast)  June 13 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 2020 GMT on Wednesday:  ** Comcast Corp offered $65 billion for Twenty-First Century Fox Inc media assets, emboldened by AT&T Inc prevailing over the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to block a merger with Time Warner Inc.  ** AT&T Inc won court approval on Tuesday to buy Time Warner Inc for $85 billion, rebuffing an attempt by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to block the deal and likely setting off a wave of corporate mergers.  ** Hong Kong\u2019s CK Infrastructure Holdings has made a A$12.98 billion ($9.8 billion) takeover offer for Australia\u2019s biggest gas pipeline company, APA Group, offering a hefty 33 percent premium to tap into a hot gas market.  ** Medical device maker Stryker Corp was not in discussions to buy rival Boston Scientific Corp, Stryker said in a regulatory filing, two days after reports of a potential deal between the two surfaced.  ** Greystar Real Estate Partners is in exclusive discussions to buy Education Realty Trust Inc, owner of collegiate housing communities, for about $3.1 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  ** Australia\u2019s Investa Office Fund and Blackstone Group entered into a scheme implementation agreement through which the U.S. private equity giant would acquire the real estate investment trust for A$3.08 billion ($2.3 billion).  ** Siemens AG is considering strategic options including a potential sale of its struggling business that makes large gas turbines for power plants, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday citing people familiar with the matter.  ** A British parliamentary committee will question the CEOs of the UK\u2019s no.2 supermarket Sainsbury\u2019s and its third-biggest supermarket Asda ahead of their proposed combination, as scrutiny of the deal cranks up.  ** Canadian utility AltaGas Ltd said it would sell a 35 percent stake in three hydroelectric projects in Northwest British Columbia for C$922 million ($707.87 million) to help fund its acquisition of U.S.-based WGL Holdings Inc.  ** Finland\u2019s centre-right government sold a stake of 5 percent in oil refiner and biofuel company Neste for 861 million euros ($1.0 billion), prompting criticism from the opposition that it gives up too much control of company.  ** German car parts maker IFA Rotorion has been put up for sale by its family owners in a potential 500 million euro ($588 million) deal, two people close to the matter said.  ** Johnson & Johnson said on Tuesday it has accepted private equity firm Platinum Equity\u2019s $2.1 billion buyout offer for the company\u2019s LifeScan Inc unit.  ** France\u2019s ERAMET increased its all-cash offer for Australia\u2019s Mineral Deposits Ltd to A$1.75 a share, valuing the company at A$344.7 million ($261 million).  ** Australia\u2019s Gateway Lifestyle Group said it received a non-binding offer from Hometown Australia Holdings Pty Ltd and Hometown America Communities Ltd Partnership - a proposal that values the company at A$635 million ($480 million).  ** Finnish utility Fortum has agreed to sell its 10 percent stake in Norwegian hydropower company Hafslund Produksjon to Svartisen Holding AS for 160 million euros ($188 million), it said.  ** Vietnam\u2019s Binh Son Refining and Petrochemical will offload a further 49 percent stake and not limit the sale to only strategic investors as previously planned, in order to attract more buyers, its chief executive officer said.  ** Madrigal Pharmaceuticals Inc is exploring a sale, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter, nearly three weeks after the company reported mid-stage data from its drug to treat non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH.  ** Italy\u2019s Benetton family is in talks with long-term investors including Singapore\u2019s GIC to sell up to 30 percent in a new holding entity that will handle its stake in Spanish telecom masts group Cellnex, four sources familiar with the deal told Reuters.  ** South African frozen fish supplier Sea Harvest Group said a consortium of black investors it leads will buy the fishing business of domestic peer Viking Fishing Group for 885 million rand ($66 million).  ** Brazil\u2019s antitrust regulator approved the $80 billion merger of gas group Linde AG and Praxair Inc, as long as the companies go ahead with an undisclosed asset sale plan.

AT&T has said it would manage Time Warner\u2019s Turner cable television networks as part of a separate business unit until February 2019 or the conclusion of the government\u2019s appeal.  \u201cIn the crucible of litigation, DOJ\u2019s claims were exposed as both narrow and fragile,\u201d AT&T company argued in court documents filed last week.

In August, the Justice Department said Leon had failed to take into account how companies negotiate with each other and seek to maximize profits in considering the Justice Department\u2019s arguments about how the deal would decrease competition.  The core of the Justice Department\u2019s concern about the deal is that AT&T, which owns DirecTV, would use its ownership of Time Warner\u2019s content to make pay TV rivals pay more, thus raising their costs and forcing them to charge consumers more.

The U.S. government wants to stop the $85 billion deal, arguing that it would hurt consumers because AT&T, which owns pay TV service DirecTV, would have more leverage to raise prices by owning Time Warner Inc\u2019s Turner networks.  Wednesday\u2019s testimony was the fourth day of the trial in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. that is due to last six to eight weeks.  The government claims that Time Warner would have an incentive to hold back Turner content from distributors that compete with AT&T and DirecTV.  \u201cI would like every distributor to carry every network I have and carry it at 100 percent penetration,\u201d Martin said, when he was cross-examined by AT&T attorney Daniel Petrocelli.  Specifically, online streaming services, such as Dish Network Corp\u2019s Sling TV and Hulu, in which subscribers pay between $20 and $40 to watch a select number of networks live and on-demand, are key for Turner given that revenue through the cable and satellite companies is decelerating, he said.  These services \u201care the only source of growth,\u201d he said, comparing them to traditional cable and satellite companies that are losing customers.  Martin took the stand on Tuesday afternoon as an adverse witness by the U.S. Department of Justice.  Department of Justice attorney Eric Welsh grilled Martin on the importance of Turner\u2019s sports rights with the National Basketball Association, \u201cMarch Madness\u201d college basketball tournament and Major League Baseball to other distributors.  When asked about the costs of these rights, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon expressed surprise to learn that Turner paid $1.1 billion.  \u201cThat was the fee to the NBA?\u201d Leon asked.

The $2.1 billion deal will mark the exit of CME\u2019s largest shareholder as the U.S. telecoms giant sells non-core assets to reduce debt.  It also expands the reach of PPF - owned by the Czech Republic\u2019s wealthiest businessman, Petr Kellner - in the media and telecommunications landscape across central and eastern Europe.  Nasdaq- and Prague-listed CME operates television stations in the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.  Under the agreement, CME\u2019s common stockholders will receive $4.58 a share, a 32% premium to the stock price before CME announced a strategic review in March that brought up the chance of a sale. But it was below Friday\u2019s closing price of $4.65.  The dual-listed shares sank in Prague on Tuesday when markets reopened after a holiday weekend, falling 6% to 101.00 crowns ($4.38) at 0912 GMT. They had closed down 5.2% at $4.41 on the Nasdaq exchange on Monday.  Analysts said investors had expected a better price per share given the recent stock and company performance. Shares had traded as high as $5.03 this month.  Shareholders also had little chance to fight for a higher price before the deal\u2019s completion expected in the middle of next year.  \u201cThe expectations were higher recently so I would say it is rather a disappointment for this price,\u201d J&T Banka analyst Pavel Ryska said.  AT&T inherited CME after it acquired Time Warner in 2018. It owns 64% of CME\u2019s common stock but effectively controls 75% when factoring in preferred shares.  Under companies law in Bermuda, where CME is registered, a merger becomes binding if it is supported by 75% of shareholders and sanctioned by court. Dissenting shareholders can only ask for a reappraisal of the price.  Analysts said this would be complicated for many.  \u201cIn our opinion, a better approach would be to realize gains now through a sale on the market rather than wait for the $4.58 per share payout or speculate on a potential offer increase,\u201d Ceska Sporitelna analyst Petr Bartek wrote.","335":"(Reuters) - AT&T Inc\u2019s Turner networks and advertising business Xandr said Tuesday they have begun using the wireless carrier\u2019s customer data to help advertisers better reach audiences across Turner brands like CNN and TBS on TV and over digital platforms.  The high-profile collaboration between the advertising division of AT&T and its newly acquired WarnerMedia will be closely watched in the industry to see if the telecom company\u2019s $85 billion bet on media content will pay off.  Turner said it has integrated Xandr\u2019s viewership data collected from 40 million television set-top boxes from AT&T\u2019s DirecTV and U-verse pay TV businesses into its strategy called AudienceNOW, which helps brands place ads on related TV shows that their audience might be interested in.  For example, if a marketer wants to reach car enthusiasts, Xandr can narrow down audiences that watched the most auto content, identify other TV shows they like to watch, and serve those viewers an ad across the different TV series, Mike Welch, senior vice president for corporate strategy and business development at Xandr, said in an interview.  AT&T\u2019s data also allows Turner and Xandr to show advertisers whether their ads convinced viewers to go to their stores or visit their website. AT&T\u2019s wireless network provides the phone location data to illustrate store visits, while its broadband business gives information on website visits, Welch said.  A major reason behind AT&T\u2019s purchase of media company Time Warner was the desire to exploit customer usage data from AT&T\u2019s 25 million TV households and an estimated 150 million U.S. wireless customers by WarnerMedia\u2019s networks. Advertisers have long sought to use customer data to boost chances of a sale by tailoring advertisements to households based on their interests.  Turner and Xandr executives said customer data will remain anonymous and will be tracked in aggregate, never narrowed down to one particular household. Instead, the companies can produce a report that compares households that saw an ad and subsequently visited a business versus households that were not served the ad, without identifying the customers.  \u201cThe holy grail is getting clients off of guaranteeing on traditional audience measurement...and taking it a step further and guaranteeing against a business outcome,\u201d said Donna Speciale, president of Turner ad sales, in an interview last week.  The companies also said branded content created by advertisers in partnership with Turner can now be targeted for delivery to specific households among the more than 15 million that have upgraded set-top boxes able to receive so-called addressable advertising.  Advertisers can now also use Xandr data to help them place ads on Turner\u2019s digital properties like CNN Digital and sports website Bleacher Report.","336":"Nov 1 (Reuters) - Dish Network Corp said on Thursday AT&T Inc had blocked HBO and Cinemax content from the U.S. satellite TV service provider\u2019s Dish and Sling TV subscribers, as the companies could not agree on a new distribution pact.

REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni\/File Photo  The business arrangement illustrates efforts by the telecommunications company to work with an influential adviser to the new president as his administration took up major industry issues and considered its $85 billion proposal to buy Time Warner Inc.  Payments by AT&T were described earlier on Tuesday by Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels, who released a report alleging that a company owned by Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, AT&T and other corporations had made payments to Essential Consultants.  Avenatti\u2019s report said AT&T had paid $200,000 in four equal payments to Essential Consultants between Oct, 3, 2017, and Jan. 3, 2018.  \u201cEssential Consultants was one of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,\u201d AT&T said in a statement.  \u201cThey did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017,\u201d it said, without commenting further.  Reuters could not immediately verify Avenatti\u2019s claim and it was not clear how he would have knowledge of any payment from Vekselberg to Cohen. Cohen and Avenatti did not respond immediately to requests for comment from Reuters.  Daniels had previously said she was paid $130,000 by Cohen to stay quiet about a sexual encounter with Trump, an encounter which Trump has denied.  The Wall Street Journal released a 2016 Delaware certificate of formation for Essential Consultants that was signed by Michael Cohen.  A person familiar with the matter said AT&T engaged with Essential Consultants around the time of the inauguration to understand how the company would be affected by several issues from the new administration, including tax reform and net neutrality.  The payments from AT&T in late 2017 and early 2018 came as it was advocating for its proposed takeover of Time Warner, which the U.S. Justice Department is trying to stop. The deal, announced in October 2016, was quickly denounced by Trump, who as a candidate and later as president has been critical of Time Warner\u2019s CNN.","344":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A judge on Tuesday denied AT&T Inc's T.N request to see White House communications that might shed light on whether U.S. President Donald Trump pressured the Department of Justice to try to block the wireless carrier's purchase of Time Warner Inc TWX.N.  An AT&T logo is pictured in Pasadena, California, U.S., January 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni  The decision is a potential setback to AT&T\u2019s plan to argue in an upcoming trial that the department\u2019s decision to oppose the acquisition was politically motivated, perhaps spurred on by Trump\u2019s public criticism of the deal and his frequent attacks on Time Warner\u2019s CNN.  The trial to decide the fate of the $85 billion deal, which the companies agreed to in October 2016, is set to begin on March 19.  AT&T lawyers said in court on Friday that the Time Warner deal may have been singled out for enforcement, citing as evidence statements by Trump as a candidate and as president that the deal was bad for consumers and the country.  But U.S. District Judge Richard Leon was not convinced. \u201cDefendants have fallen far short of establishing that this enforcement action was selective,\u201d Leon wrote in a seven-page ruling denying AT&T\u2019s access to the government communications, which might have bolstered its case.  \u201cWe respect the judge\u2019s decision and look forward to the upcoming trial,\u201d said Dan Petrocelli, lead trial attorney for both AT&T and Time Warner.  The communications consisted of potentially thousands of emails and other correspondence.  \u201cWe are pleased with and respect today\u2019s decision, which will permit the parties and court to focus on the case at hand,\u201d Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in an email statement. \u201cThis case has always been about protecting consumers from competitive harms.\u201d  Trump criticized the deal as a candidate in late 2016, saying it would concentrate too much media power in the hands of one owner, and once again in November, saying it would raise prices. He has also frequently attacked Time Warner\u2019s CNN for what he sees as negative coverage of his campaign and administration.  The Justice Department sued in November to try and stop AT&T, which owns DirecTV, from buying movie and TV show maker Time Warner, arguing that the deal would mean higher prices for rival cable and online video distributors and for consumers.  It is unclear how much the judge\u2019s decision will impact the case. Antitrust cases are judged legal or illegal depending on whether prices go up or innovation is lost because of a deal.  In a pre-trial hearing last week, AT&T\u2019s Petrocelli derided the government\u2019s case as \u201cweak,\u201d saying that their economists had determined the price of AT&T\u2019s DirecTV could go down and that there could be a small increase to non-DirecTV consumers.  The Justice Department\u2019s Craig Conrath disagreed, saying the deal would cause \u201chundreds of millions of dollars of damage.\u201d  AT&T and Time Warner shares both fell slightly.","345":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T Inc T.N will pay $5.25 million to settle a U.S. investigation after two outages in 2017 prevented about 15,000 callers from making emergency \"911\" calls, the company and a federal regulator said on Thursday.

AT&T said it has \u201ctaken steps to prevent this from happening again.\u201d  The FCC said the 911 service outages were the result of planned network changes implemented by AT&T inadvertently interfering with the company\u2019s routing of 911 calls.  The FCC said the March 2017 outage lasted about five hours, resulting in the failure of 911 calls from some 12,600 unique users, while the May 2017 outage lasted 47 minutes, resulting in 2,600 failed 911 calls.  The FCC said during the March outage the company failed to \u201cquickly, clearly, and fully notify all affected 911 call centers.\u201d  AT&T said it had cooperated with the review and agreed that \u201cproviding access to emergency 911 services is critically important.\u201d  Several other carriers agreed to settlements after an April 2014 outage affected 11 million telephone users.  Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N agreed to a $3.4 million fine after a six-hour 911 outage in April 2014 that affected about 750,000 wireless consumers in nine California counties.  CenturyLink Inc CTL.N agreed to a $16 million settlement in the April 2014 outage.  The FCC said the outages at the carriers in April 2014 resulted in 6,600 missed 911 calls about domestic violence, assault, motor vehicle accidents, a heart attack, an overdose, and an intruder breaking into a residence.  The April 2014 outage was the result of a preventable software coding error at a call management center in Colorado, the FCC said.  In 2015, T Mobile US Inc TMUS.O agreed to a $17.5 million settlement after two 911 service outages nationwide in August 2014.

U.S. construction spending unexpectedly fell in December as investment in both private and public projects dropped, leading economists to expect that the government will trim its economic growth estimate for the fourth quarter.  Before turning negative, stocks had climbed initially during the session following a report that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could reach a formal trade deal at a summit around March 27.  Optimism over the world\u2019s two largest economies reaching a trade truce already has been a significant reason fueling the market\u2019s rally since late December, along with investors\u2019 belief that the Federal Reserve will not be aggressive in raising interest rates. The S&P 500 remains up about 11 percent in 2019.  \u201cThere has been a pricing in of this expectation throughout the early months of 2019, which is partly why you have had such a bullish market,\u201d said Alicia Levine, chief strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management in New York. \u201cThe market expects a trade deal with China, so there is a little bit of sell on the news here,\u201d although Levine added that stocks ultimately could still move higher on a potential trade deal.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 259.74 points, or 1 percent, to 25,766.58, the S&P 500 lost 19.01 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,784.68 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 44.40 points, or 0.58 percent, to 7,550.95.  Levine and other market watchers also pointed to the 2,800 level for the S&P 500 as a key technical level. The benchmark index rose as high as 2,816.88 during the session.  \u201cWe have been in this area now for two to three weeks,\u201d Levine said. \u201cThe market is consolidating and we are now at more normalized valuations.\u201d  Ten of 11 major S&P 500 sectors were in negative territory, with materials eking out a gain. Healthcare was the biggest decliner, with insurer UnitedHealth Group shares down 3.9 percent and also weighing on the Dow.  In corporate news, AT&T shares fell 2.8 percent as the company is restructuring its WarnerMedia business, according to a memo sent to employees on Monday and seen by Reuters.  Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.87-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.90-to-1 ratio favored decliners.  The S&P 500 posted 40 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 77 new highs and 25 new lows.

Profeco said that in 2013 it sued telecommunications operator Nextel, which was acquired by AT&T in 2015, for undue charges, changing rates without informing customers and continuing to charge clients for services that had been canceled.  Nextel offered 4G technology on its website though \u201cit was proven in court the technology provided was inferior to what was advertised, underscoring the use of abusive and false advertising to prompt consumers into mistakenly acquiring their services,\u201d Profeco said in a statement.
