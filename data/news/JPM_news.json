Dimon, 63, experienced a tear in his heart\u2019s main artery, which was detected early and treated successfully, JPMorgan said, publicly releasing an internal memo.  He is \u201cawake, alert and recovering well,\u201d according to the memo. The bank did not disclose where Dimon is being treated.  The bank\u2019s co-presidents and co-chief operating officers, Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith, sent the message to all employees, and are running JPMorgan as Dimon recovers.  Dimon has been CEO of JPMorgan for over a decade, and is a larger-than-life figure on Wall Street.  He has fashioned himself into a voice of the industry and become more active in Washington in recent years. He often uses his platform as head of the country\u2019s biggest bank to opine on issues that fall outside that scope, including immigration, education and healthcare.  At various times, Dimon has also mocked financial regulators, cursed during public appearances and joked about becoming U.S. president.  During his time at the helm of JPMorgan, Dimon has turned the bank into a global behemoth, with leading positions in many key businesses, through crisis-era acquisitions as well as opportunistic market-share grabs.  His most vulnerable time as CEO may have come after a trader known as \u201cthe London Whale\u201d caused billions of dollars\u2019 worth of losses from derivatives positions in 2012 that management overlooked.  SUCCESSION WORRIES  Industry analysts characterized Pinto and Smith as capable hands at the helm of JPMorgan, but noted that Dimon\u2019s health scare raised new questions about who will succeed him for the long term. He also battled throat cancer after a diagnosis in 2014 that sidelined him for several months.  \u201cThis will definitely get the board to step up their efforts to put in place a succession plan because it is not going to be easy to replace someone like Dimon,\u201d said a Hong Kong-based consultant who works with the bank. \u201cThey will have to cast their net very, very wide and will have to look both internally and externally.\u201d  The condition for which Dimon had surgery on Thursday is called an acute aortic dissection, where the inner lining of the aorta tears away from the outer edge of the tube.  It is a serious, potentially deadly event that, left untreated, can lead to a heart attack or the aorta collapsing, said Dr. Gabriele Di Luozzo, director of thoracic aortic surgery at Mount Sinai Morningside hospital in New York.  During surgery, about 6-8 inches of the aorta nearest to the heart is replaced typically with a synthetic tube, said Di Luozzo.  \u201cThis is a major operation,\u201d Di Luozzo said. \u201cIn a typical elective surgery (to replace) an aorta, the risk of death is in the 2-3% range. But when you have an emergency operation it can be as high as 20%.\u201d  If treated in time, patients typically spend a week in hospital followed by several weeks recovery at home, he said.

REUTERS\/Jeenah Moon\/File Photo  Dimon\u2019s surgery was successful and bank executives said they expect him to return to work.  When Dimon was going through cancer treatment, he curtailed travel and made fewer public appearances, but eventually recovered and got back to work.  Questions about who might succeed him have existed for years, as many executives who were viewed as potential successors left out of impatience or for other opportunities.  Pinto and Smith are relatively close in age to Dimon, who said in promoting them in 2018 that he wanted to stay in the job for five more years.  Two other people often talked about as potential CEOs are Marianne Lake, who runs JPMorgan\u2019s consumer business, as well as Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak.  \u201cThe bottom line is that Mr. Dimon is often viewed as a steady hand for the banking industry during turbulent times (like we are in now),\u201d KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a note to clients, referring to recent market chaos and economic concerns stemming from the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cNot having him at the helm of JPMorgan is a modest negative.\u201d","2":"A San Diego spa has filed a proposed class action against JPMorgan Chase & Co for allegedly favoring larger businesses over smaller ones in handing out loans through the federal coronavirus relief program.

The bank plans to raise $5 billion to $10 billion in the next couple of months from clients including pension funds, sovereign-wealth funds, family offices and private banks, according to the source.  The biggest U.S. bank by assets already has about $10 billion of client capital that it plans to use on opportunities created by the market disruption in the wake of the outbreak.  That amount has roughly $3 billion earmarked for credit, $3 billion for real estate and $4 billion across transportation and infrastructure.  The pandemic has sent global financial markets into a tailspin, knocking $7 trillion off the value of S&P 500 companies and raising fears of a deep global recession.  JPMorgan said on Saturday it expected real U.S. gross domestic product to fall 10% in the first quarter and plunge 25% in the second quarter.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Dow Jones Industrial Average stock market index listed company JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is seen in Los Angeles, California, United States, in this October 12, 2010 file photo. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  Banks tend to hold loans they grant to Gulf governments in their portfolios, only selling down their exposure quietly through bilateral transactions as they don\u2019t want to be seen as dumping the paper in the market, two banking sources said.  This helps them maintain good relationships with the borrowers in light of future funding requests, but with loans raised by oil-rich Gulf states generally trading at par value, there are also few incentives for other banks to buy them in the secondary market.  However, as Gulf government and state entities seek to raise funds after the recent plunge in oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic strained budgets, banks have been trying to make room for new borrowing requests by selling down some of their exposure, the two sources said.  JPMorgan this week tried to sell down loans it has made to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF) and Abu Dhabi\u2019s Mubadala, among a few other regional names, according to a loan document known as axe sheet, seen by Reuters.  The bank was considering selling at least $50 million of PIF loan paper due in 2023 at an indicative price of 98.75 cents on the dollar, and at least 70 million euros of Mubadala loans at 99 cents on the dollar, the document showed.  JPMorgan and Mubadala declined to comment, while PIF did not respond to a request for comment.  OFFLOADING  Other banks with large exposures to Gulf governments have also tried to offload loans over the past few weeks, a Gulf-based source said.  \u201cEveryone wants money these days and we can\u2019t give everyone money,\u201d said the source, speaking anonymously due to commercial sensitivities.  \u201cEven if you put aside the current market environment, this is a region which has seen an increase in borrowing requests over the past few years so we need to make room.\u201d  The source stressed that the sale of the loans was not a sign of a change in the creditors\u2019 financial condition, with repayments due as per the agreements.  The PIF debt JPMorgan has been trying to sell is part of an $11 billion debut syndicated loan the sovereign wealth fund raised in 2018 from 15 banks, including the U.S. lender.  Gulf states have borrowed tens of billions of dollars since oil prices collapsed in 2014\/2015, taking advantage of low global rates to refill their oil-dependent state coffers, with Saudi Arabia alone borrowing more than $100 billion through loans and bonds over the past few years.  \u201cGenerally the expectation this year is there will be a lot of asks for the region ... so you make room ahead of that,\u201d the source said.  PIF - the investment fund at the centre of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s plans to diversify the Saudi economy - raised an additional $10 billion loan last year.  Some banks were hesitant to participate in that deal given the low interest rate on offer and in light of their already big exposure to Saudi entities, sources have told Reuters.

Most big U.S. banks have been slow to raise the interest rates they pay customers on their savings and deposits, despite the U.S. Federal Reserve setting current rates at between 2.25% and 2.5%.  This has left an opening for some smaller and online-only banks that are trying to capitalize on customer frustration by offering savings accounts and other products that pay between 2% and 2.45% interest.  Gordon Smith, co-president and chief operating officer for JPMorgan Chase, said that though customers are taking out money, and this is contributing to slowing in the bank\u2019s deposit growth, most of those customers still keep Chase as their main bank.  \u201cPeople are taking a component of their deposits. They\u2019re parking those deposits with a high-yield competitor, whomever they may be,\u201d said Smith, also head of JPMorgan\u2019s consumer and community banking.  \u201cThat money is very liquid,\u201d said Smith. \u201cIt\u2019ll then move from that high-yield competitor to another ... but that high-yield competitor is not winning the primary bank relationship, which is obviously what\u2019s critical.\u201d  Smith said the bank constantly reviews its deposit pricing and that interest rates are only part of what customers want from the bank.","11":"April 13 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co:  * JPMORGAN CHASE & CO - EXPECT FIRMWIDE FY2018 ADJUSTED EXPENSE OF ABOUT $63B, INCLUDING THE $1.2B IMPACT OF THE REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING STANDARD  * JPMORGAN CHASE & CO - EXPECTS FY2018 FIRMWIDE NET INTEREST INCOME TO BE $54 BLN - $55 BLN  * JPMORGAN CHASE & CO - EXPECTS FY2018 FIRMWIDE AVERAGE CORE LOAN GROWTH OF 6-7%, EXCLUDING CIB LOANS  * JPMORGAN CHASE & CO - EXPECT FIRMWIDE FY2018 NONINTEREST REVENUE GROWTH OF ABOUT 7% , MARKET DEPENDENT  * JPMORGAN CHASE & CO - EXPECT FY2018 FIRMWIDE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE TO BE ABOUT 20% Source text: [bit.ly\/2GTNU9P] Further company coverage:","12":"Feb 28 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase & Co:  * SAYS DUE TO JPMORGAN CHASE COMPUTER GLITCH, COOK COUNTY EXTENDS PROPERTY TAX DEADLINE FOR ONLINE TAXPAYERS  * SAYS BANK IS WORKING TO RESTORE SERVICE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","13":"FILE PHOTO: The Federal Reserve headquarters in Washington September 16 2015. REUTERS\/Kevin Lamarque\/File Photo  (Reuters) - The forward curve of swaps based on Federal Reserve rate expectations has inverted slightly, indicating that market participants are concerned about the U.S. central bank making a policy mistake, analysts at JPMorgan said in a report.  The forward curve of the one-month overnight index swap (OIS) rate has inverted slightly after the first quarter of 2020, implying an expectation that the Fed will cut rates after then, JPMorgan said in the report sent on Friday.  \u201cAn inversion at the front end of the U.S. curve is a significant market development, not least because it occurs rather rarely. It is also generally perceived as a bad omen for risky markets,\u201d analysts including Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said.  The two most likely explanations for the inversion is that markets are pricing for a Fed policy mistake, or for end of cycle dynamics, with a central bank mistake seen as more likely based on fund flows.  Flows into equity funds have turned slightly negative, after a strong start to the year, and interest rate sensitive sectors including real estate investment trusts (REITs) have seen outflows, which supports the hypothesis that investors are concerned about Fed policy.  Government bond exchange traded funds (ETFs) have also seen steady inflows while inflows into inflation-linked government debt ETFs have slowed, adding to the idea that there is concern about a central bank error.  Concerns about Fed policy would show as fears about earlier growth weakness and be marked by weak equity flows, greater flows into longer-dated bond funds than shorter-dated ones and weak flows in interest rate sensitive sectors.  End of cycle dynamics, on the other hand, would be reflected as overheating and inflation fears, which would boost flows into inflation-linked funds, shorter-dated bond funds and into cyclical sectors and equity funds in general.  Supporting the end of cycle thesis is that recent equity inflows have focused on cyclical sectors and outflows have been in more defensive sectors, and that inflows into short-term and floating-rate bond ETFs have outpaced those of long-term bond funds, JPMorgan said.","14":"(Adds DWS, Mercury Capital Advisors, Barclays)  May 1 (Reuters) - The following financial services industry appointments were announced on Tuesday.

JPMorgan is known as one of the stingier banks on Wall Street in terms of how much it pays revenue-generating employees.  In 2017, the largest U.S. bank spent $7.5 billion on total compensation, which includes bonuses as well as salaries and other employee-related expenses, like health benefits. That represented 31 percent of overall revenue.  In its investment bank, that amount was $2 billion last year, representing a compensation ratio of 27 percent.

REUTERS\/Stephanie Keith\/File Photo  The new business has already recruited 400 people and will offer a range of products, including current accounts, JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, said on Wednesday.  At a time of growth for online finance, JPMorgan\u2019s venture further ramps up competition in Britain\u2019s digital banking sector, where it will compete with Goldman Sachs\u2019 consumer brand Marcus which launched in Britain in 2018.  The new digital bank will also be competing with start-ups such as Starling and Monzo, which have made some headway in grabbing market share from Britain\u2019s four largest banks.  Digital financial services globally have seen a boost in business during the COVID-19 pandemic, with more homebound consumers adopting online banking and investing.  This is not JPMorgan\u2019s first attempt at a digital-only bank.  It launched a smartphone bank called Finn in its home market in 2017, but shut it down a year after its nationwide debut.  Other large banks have also had mixed results when attempting to fend off competition through new digital offshoots.

FILE PHOTO: Bottles of prescription painkiller OxyContin pills, made by Purdue Pharma LP sit on a counter at a local pharmacy in Provo, Utah, U.S., April 25, 2017. REUTERS\/George Frey\/File Photo  The move makes JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, the most high-profile corporation known to have distanced itself from Purdue and its wealthy owners, the Sackler family, amid thousands of lawsuits alleging the company pushed addictive painkillers while downplaying their abuse and overdose risks.  JPMorgan\u2019s decision also underscores a drive among U.S. banks to reassess their relationships with clients and industries in response to controversy and political debates over matters such as immigration detention and mass shootings.  After JPMorgan informed Purdue in March that it had six months to find another bank, Purdue tapped Dallas-based regional bank Comerica Inc to handle its financial transactions and accounts, the sources said.  JPMorgan told Purdue that reputational risks associated with the public backlash against the drugmaker informed its decision to cut business ties, the sources added.  While not a lender to Purdue, JPMorgan\u2019s commercial bank managed the company\u2019s cash and bill payments, according to the sources. It is not clear how long JPMorgan served as Purdue\u2019s bank.  \u201cPurdue is a streamlined organization with an exciting pipeline of new medicines and significant cash reserves,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThe company has multiple banking relationships and will not have any interruption to its banking and financial service needs.\u201d  JPMorgan and Comerica declined to comment.  Purdue faces roughly 2,000 lawsuits accusing the Stamford, Connecticut-based company, and increasingly the Sacklers, of aggressively marketing prescription opioids while misleading prescribers and consumers about risks from their prolonged use.  U.S. states, counties and cities are seeking billions of dollars in damages to address harm from opioids. Nearly 400,000 people have died after overdosing on opioids between 1999 and 2017, according to the latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than half the deaths resulted from prescription painkillers.  Purdue denies it contributed to the U.S. opioid crisis, pointing to U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals of labels for the company\u2019s drugs that carried warnings about risk and abuse associated with treating pain. Purdue and its family owners argue that heroin and fentanyl are currently more significant culprits in the opioid epidemic.  However, health experts have said many people turn to those drugs after first getting hooked on prescription painkillers.  In March, Purdue and the Sackler family reached a $270 million settlement with the state of Oklahoma, which on Tuesday is set to take two other drugmakers to trial over claims they also helped fuel the opioid epidemic. Dozens of other states have lawsuits pending against Purdue, and in some instances the Sacklers, who made a financial contribution to the Oklahoma settlement even though they were not defendants in the case.  A North Dakota judge earlier this month dismissed that state\u2019s case against Purdue.  Purdue Chief Executive Officer Craig Landau in March said a bankruptcy filing remained an option for the company to address potential liabilities from widespread litigation.  LATEST TO SHUN  Various museums, universities and other nonprofits are now shunning donations or reassessing their relationships with the Sackler family, which has a long history of philanthropy.  In New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, which has a wing named for the Sacklers, and the American Museum of Natural History, said earlier this month they had ceased accepting donations from the family.  For JPMorgan, dropping Purdue is the latest in a series of moves aimed at steering clear of political lightning rods. In January, the bank said it would stop financing operators of private prisons, which have become the target of protests over their role detaining undocumented immigrants.  Its peers have made similar moves. In March, Wells Fargo & Co\u2019s CEO at the time, Tim Sloan, told a congressional panel the bank was exiting relationships with private prison operators.  Citigroup Inc, meanwhile, last year placed restrictions on firearms sales for retailers doing business with the bank following the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida. A Bank of America Corp executive said last year that the bank intended to avoid financing military-style firearms for civilians moving forward.","19":"FILE PHOTO: A view of the exterior of the JP Morgan Chase & Co. corporate headquarters in New York City May 20, 2015.

FILE PHOTO: The Citigroup Inc (Citi) logo is seen at the SIBOS banking and financial conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada October 19, 2017. Picture taken October 19, 2017. REUTERS\/Chris Helgren  Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Bank of America Corp all reported declines in fourth-quarter revenue from their key fixed income, commodity and currency trading arms, although overall results at most were cushioned by improving loan growth and net interest margins.  The final months of 2018 were dominated by investor worries about slowing global growth and the U.S.-China trade dispute and were further aggravated by concerns that the Fed might be pushing interest rates too high. The resulting volatility in equity, bond and commodity markets sent many investors to the sidelines, pushing down bond trading volume and hurting the value of credit market assets sitting on banks\u2019 own books.  \u201cYou had a one-two punch of market losses on inventory along with a lot of bank clients stepping back from market because you couldn\u2019t have much of an opinion given the uncertainty,\u201d said Jeffery Harte, bank analyst at Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners.  Credit spreads, the measure of additional compensation investors demand for owning riskier corporate securities over safer U.S. Treasuries, widened in the fourth quarter by the most in more than seven years both for investment-grade and high-yield, or junk, bonds, according to ICE BofAML index data.  Moreover, corporate bond issuance largely dried up, slicing into underwriting fees.  As quarterly results spilled out this week, it became clear that it all added up to a sizable hit for Wall Street\u2019s biggest players.  Bank of America said fixed income fees fell 5 percent because of lower debt underwriting and advisory fees, while its adjusted sales and trading revenue fell 6 percent, with a 15 percent fall in bond trading. Goldman Sachs\u2019 bond trading revenue slid 18 percent to $822 million, far from its peak of more than $6 billion.  In both cases, a big surge in equity trading volumes during the quarter helped offset those losses.  But JPMorgan missed profit estimates for the fourth quarter as its bond trading revenue slump overpowered strong consumer loan growth.  At Citigroup, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said for much of the quarter corporate and investor clients \u201cremained on the sidelines, waiting for some clearer market conditions.\u201d Citi reported a 21 percent fall in revenue in its markets and securities business for the quarter.  After being slow to address the spasms in financial markets, Fed officials in recent weeks have said they are mindful of how such moves have tightened financial conditions. The Fed raised interest rates four times in 2018, but since the start of this year a chorus of Fed officials, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have come out to pledge that they will take it slow from here.  That dovish tone has investors in a better mood so far in the first quarter.  The S&P 500 is up more than 11 percent from its Dec. 24 low and junk bonds are enjoying their strongest start to a year in a decade, according to ICE BofAML\u2019s high-yield index.  The S&P bank sector has risen 17.5 percent since its Dec. 24 low, including a 5.6 percent gain since Citigroup kicked off earnings season on Monday.  Even as \u201cthe potential for tape-bombs from trade and political developments still present challenges, the dovish pivot at the Fed has helped calmed markets,\u201d said Craig Bishop, lead strategist for U.S. fixed income strategies at RBC Wealth Management. \u201cThis has contributed to tamping down fixed income volatility, so to me it could be just a matter of one bad month\/quarter.\u201d  But no one is quite ready to dismiss the possibility that the environment could change quickly again for the worse.  \u201cThat could change tomorrow,\u201d said Sandler O\u2019Neill\u2019s Harte. \u201cThat\u2019s the trouble with trading revenues, they\u2019re awfully volatile.

Five banks have reached $491.5 million of settlements in the case, including earlier settlements of $170 million by Deutsche Bank AG, $94 million by Barclays Plc and $45 million by HSBC Holdings Plc.  Euribor is the euro-denominated equivalent of Libor, a benchmark for setting rates on hundreds of trillions of dollars of credit cards, student loans, mortgages and other debt.  Investors including the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System (CalSTRS) pension fund accused banks of rigging Euribor and fixing prices of Euribor-based derivatives from June 2005 to March 2011 to profit at their expense.

The largest U.S. bank by assets, whose results are often seen as a barometer of the economy, has benefited from a tax windfall and a strong economy that has led to higher interest rates and kept loan defaults in check.  All four of JPMorgan\u2019s main businesses recorded a rise in revenue, with the consumer banking unit notching the biggest jump in revenue due to a healthy appetite for borrowing. Trading was the only weak spot in the results.  Chief Executive Jamie Dimon praised President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts and deregulatory efforts, but cautioned on inflation and \u201cgeopolitical issues bursting all over the place.\u201d  \u201cThe U.S. and the global economy continue to show strength, despite increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties, which at some point in the future may have negative effects on the economy,\u201d Dimon said.  JPMorgan shares fell 2 percent late Friday afternoon. Worries about lackluster trading and weak loan growth have weighed on bank stocks this year, with the S&P Financial index .SPSY falling about 5 percent and underperforming the broader S&P 500 index .SPX.  JPMorgan is the best performing stock among the big six U.S. banks. Including losses from the market carnage over the past two days that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI drop more than 1,300 points, the stock is the only one among the big banks to be in positive territory for the year.  The bank's average core loan book rose 6 percent in the third quarter and outperformed Citigroup's C.N 4 percent growth even as higher rates crimped borrowing in areas such as mortgage loans.  Trading revenue fell 2.5 percent amid an escalating trade war between Beijing and Washington and worries about slowing global growth.  Bond trading revenue fell 10 percent - in sharp contrast to Citigroup's C.N 9 percent increase - while equity trading revenue was up 17 percent.  JPMorgan\u2019s total revenue rose 5.2 percent to $27.82 billion. Net income rose 24.5 percent to $8.38 billion, or $2.34 per share. Analysts had expected earnings of $2.25 per share, according to I\/B\/E\/S data from Refinitiv.  \u201cEverything looks nice and steady for JPMorgan,\u201d Octavio Marenzi, CEO of capital markets management consultancy Opimas said. \u201cThis portends well for the rest of the US banking industry.\u201d  Net interest income - the difference between what the bank earns on loans and pay on deposits - rose 7 percent to $14.1 billion as the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates four times since the third quarter of last year, bringing it to 2.25 percent.  JPMorgan\u2019s non-interest expenses were $15.6 billion, up 7.2 percent. Analysts had expected about $15.7 billion of expenses in the quarter.  Operating costs have risen across the industry as banks are spending more on technology and expanding their business amid a strengthening economy.","40":"(Adds Breakingviews link)  WASHINGTON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump had a sharp rejoinder for Jamie Dimon on Thursday, saying the JPMorgan chief executive lacked the \u201csmarts\u201d to be president but was otherwise wonderful.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission said on Friday it will continue to approve foreign brokerage joint ventures \u201cefficiently\u201d, after announcing its decision for the two banks.  Allowing foreign banks a controlling stake in securities joint ventures is a key part of China\u2019s pledge to ease ownership curbs, especially in the trillion-dollar financial sector.  A lack of control and limited contribution to revenue have long been a source of frustration for western investment banks, and a reason behind JP Morgan\u2019s 2016 decision to sell its 33 percent ownership in its then Chinese joint venture.  Western banks including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse run joint ventures, whose offerings include debt and equity underwriting and financial advisory, with varying degrees of operational control.  Beijing gave UBS approval in November to hold a majority stake in its securities joint venture, making it the first foreign bank to do so under new rules announced in 2017.  COMPLETE SERVICES  JP Morgan and Nomura applied to set up majority-controlled joint ventures in China last year. But unlike UBS, neither has a mainland joint venture and would need to start from scratch.  The majority-owned securities venture will allow JP Morgan to further strengthen its China business and offer \u201ca complete set of services and solutions\u201d to its clients, the Wall Street bank said in a statement.  \u201cIt\u2019s a critical component of our growth plans globally as well as in Asia Pacific,\u201d JP Morgan Asia Pacific Chairman and Chief Executive Nicolas Aguzin, said.  Nomura said it\u2019s China joint venture would initially focus on the wealth management business, and expand its offerings \u201cwith the ultimate goal of growing the business into a full-fledged brokerage\u201d.  \u201cWith an increased presence in China, we aim to support economic growth in both China and Japan and firmly establish ourselves as a global financial services group with deep roots in Asia,\u201d Nomura Chief Executive Koji Nagai said.  The recent approvals for greater access to foreigners, from insurance to asset management, comes amid a festering trade war with the United States, with increased access to the financial sector among a host of demands from Washington.  Premier Li Keqiang said on Thursday that Beijing will expand market access for foreign banks and securities and insurance companies, especially in financial services.  China has in recent years allowed many foreign financial firms to either set up new businesses onshore or expand their presence through majority ownership in joint ventures.  Besides UBS, HSBC also holds 51 percent of its securities business in China, which was launched in 2017, but the Asia-focused bank does so under rules allowing Hong Kong-based companies special access.","43":"(Reuters) - Electricity North West, which is owned in part by the asset management arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, has hired advisers to conduct a strategic review and plan a 2 billion pound ($2.55 billion) sale of the company, Sky News reported on Tuesday.

To identify which potential interns might be best suited for a job, the platform measures a candidate\u2019s attributes against those of a firm\u2019s successful employees. This helps companies make their assessments more data-based than traditional processes.  Over the past few months, entry level employees at JPMorgan across the world played the pymetrics\u2019 games, which were then played by hundreds of candidates for a limited number of full-time roles, Mitro said.  Mitro said employment history is a good indicator of fit for experienced workers, but with recent college graduates, resumes have less predictive value. That prompted JPMorgan to test pymetrics\u2019 technology with entry-level candidates, who are usually just starting their careers.

The investment also shows that the bank is betting that supporting finance apps and having meeting spaces for community groups in its branches could result in more new customers.  A newly renovated Harlem branch bank on West 125th Street is passed more than 1 million pedestrians weekly, and the bank redesigned it to have several meeting rooms that can be reserved for free by people and businesses in the community.  This is a new take on a trend started by other banks like Capital One, which converted several of its branches into cafes in a bid to drive more people into the bank\u2019s costly brick and mortar locations.  JPMorgan\u2019s location has a storefront where local entrepreneurs can hold pop-up shops, as local retailer and hat maker Flamekeepers Hat Club did in August.  The bank plans to open five more branches like the Harlem branch, next in Los Angeles.","57":"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan\u2019s Daiichi Sankyo Co is exploring the sale of its over-the-counter drugs (OTC) business and has hired JPMorgan to advise on the potential deal, several people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

FILE PHOTO: A view of the exterior of the JP Morgan Chase & Co. corporate headquarters in New York City May 20, 2015. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/Files\/File Photo  Still, senior executives, speaking at the bank\u2019s annual investor day, painted a picture of stable financial performance and maintained a key profit goal for the next three years.  Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said while JPMorgan is strong in many of its businesses, the bank was uncertain whether the near-term future for interest rates and the U.S. economy would provide the underlying strength that could boost its bankwide profit targets.  JPMorgan\u2019s annual investor day is closely watched by investors as the bank accounts for about 14 percent of U.S. banking industry revenue, according to estimates by analysts at Barclays.  Lake said the bank expects growth in deposits to slow and the interest it pays for them to rise, reducing profit margins on its loans. At the same time, new regulations are making those loans less profitable and pushing the bank to invest more in securities.  \u201cThe further out you go, the less confidence we have that we won\u2019t see\u201d changes in interest rates and a downturn in the economy, Lake said, when asked why the bank did not raise its target for profitability.  Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the bank\u2019s decision not to raise its profitability target was not a warning about the economy. \u201cWe are not predicting a recession. We are prepared for a recession,\u201d Dimon said.  Like last year, the bank said it expects its return on tangible common equity, a key profit measure for how well it uses shareholder money, to be 17 percent over the medium term, which the bank considers roughly three years.  The bank may exceed its key growth targets, Lake said, but its forecast is set with a cautious view of future risks, including global trade worries as well as Britain\u2019s pending withdrawal from the European Union, or Brexit, she said.  \u201cRecent declines in business sentiment have driven recessionary risk higher,\u201d she said, referring to the United States.  Still, she added, \u201cthe U.S. economy remains consumer-led, and consumers are strong and healthy.\u201d  JPMorgan faces a balancing act: reassuring investors while not making pledges that are likely to haunt it in the future amid growing economic turbulence.  In the fourth quarter, JPMorgan and several other big banks took a hit in their fixed-income trading operations as a market swoon kept clients on the sidelines.  Trading revenue in the first quarter is expected to be down in the \u201chigh teens\u201d in percentage terms after an unusually strong quarter a year earlier when the U.S. tax overhaul boosted results, said Daniel Pinto, head of JPMorgan\u2019s corporate and investment bank.  In a recession, Dimon said, the bank would continue to invest in its businesses. \u201cWe would take advantage of a recession to build our branches, network, etcetera. We would take advantage of a recession.\u201d  While executives trumpeted market share gains from recently increased spending on technology and marketing, they also acknowledged problems.  \u201cIt is a tough time to be in the mortgage business,\u201d said Gordon Smith, chief executive officer of consumer and community banking.  Mike Weinbach, head of home lending, said mortgage originations will likely remain \u201cnear cyclical lows\u201d in the coming years. The industry is struggling with excess capacity for making loans, even as the cost of new loans continues to rise, he said.  The bank sketched out its views before the stock market opened in a slide presentation ahead of the investor day. (bit.ly\/2GMaYXR)  JPMorgan shares fell 1.2 percent at $104.84 after dropping as much as 2 percent early in the session.  The bank stuck with its previous targets of an expense overhead ratio of 55 percent as adjusted expenses were set to rise this year by $2.3 billion, or 3.6 percent.  The higher expense forecast includes $600 million of new technology investments and $1.6 billion for marketing, front-office hiring, new branches and a new headquarters building.  The additional spending is down from $2.7 billion a year ago, when it boosted the technology budget by $1.4 billion.","60":"NEW YORK, Feb 25 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co executives are unlikely to provide new financial targets at the bank\u2019s annual investor day on Tuesday, and instead will use the forum to showcase a clean-energy initiative, analysts said. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported record earnings last year and easily met management\u2019s stated goals for expenses and profitability.  But its metrics are best-in-class among big U.S. banks, and JPMorgan\u2019s sheer size presents challenges for further growth, analysts said.  \u201cWe believe the challenge is for JPM to maintain this strong operating performance while at the same time investing for growth and gaining customer wallet share,\u201d said Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo.  Nonetheless, Wall Street pays close attention to JPMorgan\u2019s investor day, where Chief Executive Jamie Dimon and other senior leaders offer views about key businesses, as well as the global economy and financial markets. Those presenting include Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak, head of Consumer & Community Banking Gordon Smith, Head of Consumer Lending Marianne Lake and others. The event starts at 8 a.m. in New York.  Executives are likely to express optimism about JPMorgan\u2019s potential, despite unsettling macroeconomic events such as concerns over the fast-spreading coronavirus, the 2020 U.S. presidential election and low interest rates, analysts said.  On Monday, global markets plunged as investors ran for safety on fears that a rise in coronavirus cases outside China could expand damage to the global economy. In the United States, the Dow dropped more than 1,000 points for just the third time in history.  However, JPMorgan will likely keep the bank\u2019s official outlook stable for expenses relative to revenue, and for return on tangible common equity (ROTCE), which measures how well a bank uses shareholder money to produce profit.  Last year, JPMorgan\u2019s efficiency ratio of 55% and its full-year ROTCE of 19% met and exceeded management\u2019s targets of 55% and 17%, respectively.  The bank\u2019s main announcement will center on steps it is taking to reduce financing for coal mining projects and companies and to facilitate $200 billion in loans and other financing for clean-energy and sustainability initiatives by the end of 2020.  The bank detailed some of that plan on Monday, after years of pressure from environmental activists and steps taken by other major financial firms including Blackrock Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  JPMorgan shares closed at $132.14 on Monday, near a record high, leaving the bank as the most valuable by market value globally.

Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries - Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar - have issued a quarter of all new debt sold by emerging markets in each of the last three years. They now account for 14 percent of total EM debt stock.  A spokesman for the bank declined to comment on the likelihood of Gulf countries getting the green light in the next update of the index, which normally gets announced around September.  A source at the bank told Reuters that its \u201cindices work to strict rules of eligibility and this rumored scenario with GCC countries (gaining inclusion) may never come to pass\u201d.  The presentation showed how GCC countries are too high on the World Bank High Income classification (IIC) index to meet normal emerging market index eligibility.  However, there could be other ways to look at it, such as purchasing power parity ratios that the IMF and OECD use to compare different countries\u2019 wealth. That would class GCC countries firmly as emerging markets.  Analysts and investors were beginning to run the numbers on what inclusion would mean in terms of bond buying.  According to JP Morgan\u2019s estimates, about $360 billion track its hard-currency emerging market debt indexes. About $150 billion of debt from GCC may get added with an expected weight of 12.33 percent. A phase-in could happen at 2 percent a month for six months.  \u201cThis could lead to passive inflows of over $45 billion, which will be about 30 percent of total amount outstanding of the bonds to be added,\u201d said Abhishek Kumar, the managing director for emerging markets debt and fixed income beta at State Street Global Advisers.

While strength in mortgage banking and cheap valuations could provide support to the S&P 500 bank index, its performance depends on what reassurance executives provide on credit conditions, the outlook for loan growth and their ability to reduce deposit costs during their conference calls.  Tuesday brings third quarter profit reports from Citigroup Inc, Wells Fargo and Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, and Goldman Sachs. Bank of America reports on Wednesday.  The biggest U.S. banks will report a 1.2% decline in third-quarter earnings, while revenue is seen rising 0.9%, according to data aggregated by Refinitiv analyst David Aurelio. This would be the first profit decline since the same quarter in 2016, according to data from Factset.  \u201cOverall it\u2019s shaping up to be a pretty challenging quarter because of the net interest rate environment,\u201d said Fred Cannon, director of research for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York, citing the flattening and temporary inversion of the U.S. Treasury 2-year\/10-year yield curve during the quarter.  Bank profits depend heavily on net interest income, or the difference between the rate they charge for long-term loans and the rate they pay for short-term borrowing.  Executives from Citi, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan all cut their full-year forecasts for net interest income last month, citing macroeconomic concerns.  Part of the problem is U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in July and September. And futures traders are betting on more Fed rate cuts going forward, including one in October.  As a result, bank investors will listen for executive reassurance on the net interest margin outlook and their ability to mitigate weakness, said Manulife Investment Management\u2019s Lisa Welch, who manages the John Hancock Regional Bank Fund.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  One offset to lower lending profits would be a reduction in interest rates banks pay their customers for deposits, as those rates rose while the Fed was hiking interest rates.  \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of questions on how fast banks are able to bring down their deposit costs as loan yields are coming down,\u201d said Welch, adding that she does not expect deposit costs \u201cto come down as quickly as loan yields have fallen.\u201d  Mortgages may be another silver lining to lower rates in third-quarter numbers and future quarters as borrowers avail of cheaper rates. Refinancing, which accounts for most mortgage applications, has more than doubled from a year ago, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data released on Wednesday.  \u201cWith rates being lower, we think mortgage activity will be very strong,\u201d said Welch, pointing to First Horizon as one bank that could benefit from mortgage demand.  Bank of America and Wells Fargo should also benefit, according to KBW\u2019s Cannon. To cope with rising demand, Wells Fargo is boosting its mortgage team, according to a memo seen by Reuters this week.  But investors will also be on high alert for signs slowing U.S. economic growth is hurting debt repayments, said Mike Cronin, investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments.  \u201cGiven that we\u2019ve had some economic data that\u2019s been a little weaker is there any trend in credit costs that raises concerns going into 2020?\u201d said Cronin.  So far, strong credit quality and bank balance sheets have reassured KBW\u2019s Cannon, who is neutral on the sector. \u201cBut if we start to see meaningful credit deterioration that would change our minds about how we think about the banks,\u201d he said.  Cannon did not recommend buying banks going into earnings season due to the likelihood \u201cconsensus estimates come down in the quarter.\u201d But on the plus side, he said, valuations do seem to reflect an expectation for further weakness.  (GRAPHIC - S&P bank index valuation vs S&P 500: )  The S&P Bank index has gained 14% year-to-date, compared with a 16.5% advance for the S&P 500. But the sector\u2019s trading multiple of 10.2 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months compares well to its historical average of 12.6 and the benchmark S&P\u2019s current trading multiple of 16.4.

But, after a spate of weak manufacturing data, Aberdeen Standard\u2019s Cronin is looking for data to stabilize before recommending the sector.  \u201cThere is a lot of downside priced into the stocks but overall I\u2019d still say I\u2019m not really positive on the group just yet,\u201d he said.","77":"A J.P.

A sharp negative turn on Wall Street, which wiped out its earlier gains, kindled safe-haven demand for bonds. The U.S. Treasury Department sold $65 billion in one-month bills; $24 billion in one-year T-bills and $35 billion in five-year notes to average demand. The auctions on Monday and Tuesday were equivalent to 85 percent of the scheduled Treasuries supply this week. \"There is the cash out there for these issues,\" said John Canavan, market strategist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in New York. Canavan said he expected solid bidding for $29 billion of seven-year notes and $15 billion in two-year floating-rate notes on Wednesday. Lingering worries about a trade war between the United States and China have supported safe-haven demand for Treasuries, though Wall Street stock prices initially rose for a second day on Tuesday following last week's plunge tied to fears about an escalation of trade barriers between the world's two biggest economies. \"Despite today\u2019s stock market rebound, 'flight-to-quality' sentiment may still linger given market concerns over trade policies, which could be supportive for demand,\" analysts at Nomura Securities International wrote in a research note. The share of investors who are bullish on longer-dated Treasuries rose to its highest level since last June, a survey from JPMorgan released on Tuesday showed. The $14.7 trillion Treasury sector was on track to generate about a 0.4 percent total return in March, bouncing back from two straight months of losses, according to an index compiled by Barclays and Bloomberg. Moreover, the Conference Board said its gauge of U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly fell to 127.7 in March from a revised 130.0 in February. This raised some worries about consumer spending in the first quarter, analysts said. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down 5.9 basis points to 2.783 percent after touching its lowest level since Feb. 9. Two-year yields were down 4.2 basis points to 2.274 percent, while the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds touched a near seven-week low and was last down 4.3 basis points to 3.028 percent. On Wall Street, the three major stock indexes turned negative in afternoon trading, dragged down by technology shares.

FILE PHOTO: A J.P. Morgan logo is seen in New York City, U.S. January 10, 2017. REUTERS\/Stephanie Keith\/File Photo  The largest U.S. bank by assets set the new deadline in a letter sent to the companies in late January, in which it said they must agree to a \u201cconcrete plan\u201d to transition to a new method of collecting customer data, according to two people familiar with the matter.  Otherwise, JPMorgan will block all automated access to the data, including through so-called screenscraping, or the process of collecting data from one application to use it in another, the people said.  A JPMorgan spokesman confirmed the contents of the letter and said the company already had agreements covering more than 95% of data access requests.  The deadline is the latest move in the bank\u2019s effort to transition fintechs and data aggregators to what it has said is a more secure way of accessing customer data.  Fintech startups, such as those that offer budgeting apps or digital wealth management, usually connect to a user's bank account to gather the necessary data to provide their services. Some gather the data through aggregators such as Yodlee and Plaid, which is in the process of being acquired by Visa Inc V.N, while others request that customers provide their password.  Through JPMorgan\u2019s new method, fintechs will not be able to use customers\u2019 passwords to access their entire financial data, but will instead connect to a set of bank programming code known as an API, that grants access only to limited account information authorized by the consumer.  The transition comes as large banks and fintech companies globally tussle over data-sharing. Banks have said their wariness to grant access to third parties stems from a need to protect highly sensitive information, such as transaction history and income.  Fintechs have been skeptical, arguing that it should be up to consumers, not banks, to decide what companies can look at that information.  JPMorgan said earlier this year that it was preparing to crack down on the use of customer passwords for data-sharing purposes, and had been discussing another method to access information since 2016.  However, some startups said they were surprised by the stringent requirements and strict deadline in the letter, according to one fintech source.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this with aggregators and fintechs since 2016 because our secure API is the best way to help our customers make smart money decisions more easily and safely,\u201d Paul LaRusso, managing director of digital platforms at Chase, said in a written statement to Reuters.  The bank said companies that have agreed to JPM\u2019s terms would be able to continue accessing customer data using existing tools, provided they have a concrete plan in place to move to the new method and are making progress toward that goal.  \u201cCustomers can still use their favorite apps and websites while these companies migrate to our API,\u201d LaRusso said.  JPMorgan\u2019s new policy could drive more fintechs to work with data aggregators that already have agreements with the bank, such as Plaid, said Sam Maule, managing partner for North America at fintech consultancy 11:FS.  \u201cBut most consumers won\u2019t really notice any change,\u201d Maule said.","84":"NEW YORK\/LONDON\/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Regulatory scrutiny of precious metals trading at JPMorgan Chase & Co., one of the world\u2019s largest gold brokerages, has expanded to Singapore and ensnared two more bank employees, according to people familiar with the situation.

Efforts to reach Turnbull were unsuccessful. Ka, a longtime JPMorgan employee who recently won a trading award from the Shanghai Gold Exchange, did not respond to requests for comment.  The exact nature of MAS\u2019s interest is unclear. It has not publicly accused the bank of wrongdoing. A spokeswoman said that, as a matter of policy, the Singapore authority \u201cdoes not comment on our dealings with specific financial institutions.\u201d  JPMorgan has said in U.S. regulatory filings that its metals trading practices are the subject of probes from \u201cvarious authorities\u201d and that it is \u201cresponding to and cooperating with these investigations.\u201d  The ongoing probe by U.S. officials, which includes the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has already resulted in charges against six people in 2018 and 2019 related to alleged spoofing activity between 2007 and 2016.  Spoofing involves placing bids to buy or offers to sell contracts with the intent to cancel them before execution, allowing traders to influence prices.  The U.S. charges have alleged the illegal trading practices took place across JPMorgan\u2019s global precious metals trading desks in New York, London and Singapore.

Leung was charged in May by Hong Kong\u2019s Independent Commission Against Corruption with bribing the then chairman of a potential client, a logistics company, by employing his son at the U.S. investment bank.  While Hong Kong's anti-corruption watchdog did not name the company or the chairman at the time, the prosecution in the Leung case said on Thursday that she had \"offered advantages\" to Keng-lam Ang, chairman of Kerry Logistics Network Ltd 0636.HK.  Leung did that in anticipation that Ang would return the favor by influencing Kerry Logistics and its parent Kerry Properties Ltd 0683.HK to give business to JPMorgan, the prosecution alleged in its summary of facts.  Leung did not comment when approached by Reuters outside the court room. Ang and his son could not be immediately reached for comment via their current employer.  A Kerry Logistics representative said in an email that Ang stepped down from Kerry Logistics Network Limited\u2019s chairmanship in August 2012, and that JPMorgan did not participate in Kerry Logistics\u2019 IPO in December 2013.  A spokeswoman for Kerry Properties did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  A spokeswoman for JPMorgan declined to comment and instead referred to the bank\u2019s statement made when Leung was charged in May that said: \u201cThis is a historical case, which J.P. Morgan reached agreement on and settled in 2016\u201d.  JPMorgan agreed to pay U.S. authorities $264 million in 2016 here resolve allegations it hired the relatives of Chinese officials - dubbed \"princelings\" - to win banking deals.  The bank did not admit or deny the charges. As part of its settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, a Hong Kong unit of the bank admitted to making quid pro quo hiring agreements with Chinese officials to win investment business.  U.S. authorities at the time said JPMorgan\u2019s Asia unit created an elaborate program, called \u201cSons and Daughters\u201d, that allowed clients and influential government officials to recommend potential hires.  \u201cBLINK BLINK, NOD NOD\u201d  Leung was vice-chair of Asia investment banking when she left JPMorgan in February 2015. She first joined JPMorgan in 1994, according to her LinkedIn profile, and left to join rival Merrill Lynch in 2001, before rejoining JPMorgan in 2002.  In 2009, Kerry Properties 0683.HK decided to spin out and list Kerry Logistics 0636.HK in Hong Kong. Leung liaised with top company executives for the IPO and other services that JPMorgan could offer, the prosecution summary showed.  Having considered the existing and potential business opportunities from Kerry Logistics, Leung allegedly sought to offer the chairman\u2019s son, Ang Ren-yi, a job with JPMorgan under the bank\u2019s \u201cSons and Daughters\u201d program, the summary said.  Kerry Logistics is \u201cclose to mandating banks for their IPO. We are a strong contender. Blink Blink nod nod, can we find a place for his son ...\u201d, Leung allegedly wrote in an internal email to her colleagues on Jan. 10, 2010.  Leung arranged interviews for the son and persuaded her colleagues to hire him, the prosecution summary said, adding that Ang Ren-yi was given a job contract starting from June. 28, 2010 as an analyst with the bank in Hong Kong.  Ang Ren-yi resigned from JPMorgan on Oct 28, 2011.  Management of Kerry Logistics said they did not allow Ang, or any employee, to accept advantages from JPMorgan staff as rewards for showing favor to JPMorgan, the document shows.  Leung\u2019s trial has been set to start on Feb. 25, 2020, and will continue for eight days, Glen Kong, prosecutor, said.  Kong asked the judge to consider merging Leung\u2019s case with that of another ongoing investigation as the two share a similar witness list.

A senior investigator at antitrust regulator the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) was also named in a court hearing as a witness in the country\u2019s biggest prosecution of alleged white collar crime.  The investment banks are accused of colluding over a A$3 billion ($2 billion) capital raising.  The local units of JPMorgan, Citi and Deutsche all worked on a share issue for the country's then third-largest bank Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd ANZ.AX in 2015.  Last year, the ACCC brought charges against Citi, Deutsche, ANZ and several of those companies\u2019 top employees alleging they colluded to keep from regular shareholders the fact that the issue was undersubscribed.  The previously undisclosed involvement of witnesses who worked at JPMorgan, which was not charged, raises the chances the case will involve global investment banks testifying against each other when it goes to trial, as well as defending themselves against government prosecutors.  The lawyer for Citi\u2019s former Australia head, Stephen Roberts, named as witnesses Richard Galvin, JPMorgan\u2019s former head of equity and derivative capital markets, and Jeffrey Herbert-Smith, JPMorgan\u2019s former managing director and head of markets, in an application to be allowed to cross-examine them.  Roberts\u2019 lawyer, Robert Dick, told the court he wanted to question the two ex-JPMorgan people on written statements about Roberts\u2019 participation in a phone call at the time of the capital raising.

An ACCC spokeswoman declined to comment on Won\u2019s behalf.

A former JPMorgan banker gave the timeline as the first witness to testify in a legal battle that is being closely watched by investment bankers around the world because it may change the way they are permitted to conduct capital raising.  JPMorgan, Citigroup Inc C.N and Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE worked on a A$2.5 billion ($1.70 billion) stock issue for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) ANZ.AX in August 2015.  All but JPMorgan were charged last year with withholding details of the sale process to investors. Prosecutors accuse the three banks of forming a cartel to restrict the supply of ANZ shares and maintain their price after the banks were unable to sell them all to regular investors, court documents showed.  JPMorgan was given immunity on condition that it cooperate with authorities, the court previously heard.  The defendants\u2019 lawyers want to question prosecution witnesses to determine how and when they came to give signed statements, and who was involved.  \u201cI received a call from my boss in Hong Kong, Nicholas Johnson, telling me to be (available) in mid-March 2016,\u201d JPMorgan\u2019s former head of equity capital markets, Richard Galvin, told a packed court room in Sydney on Thursday.  At a meeting a few days later with company lawyers in Sydney, \u201cthey mentioned there was a matter that had come up around the ANZ capital raising,\u201d Galvin said.  In June 2016, Galvin said he received a \u201cletter of comfort\u201d from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), assuring him immunity if he co-operated with their investigation into the capital raising.  The next month, he met ACCC investigators during which they began to draft a statement about his recollection of the raising, Galvin told the court.  Two years later, in June 2018, the ACCC brought criminal charges against Citi, Deutsche and ANZ.

The bank said directors based the pay decision on \u201cthe firm\u2019s strong performance\u201d last year during the coronavirus pandemic and over the long term across business results, risk controls and conduct; client, customer and stakeholder focus; and teamwork and leadership.  The rationale provided by the board was similar to that offered for Dimon\u2019s compensation for 2019.  Under Dimon, who turns 65 in March, JPMorgan produced net income of $29.1 billion for 2020, down from $36.4 billion a year earlier, and a return on tangible common equity of 14%, down from 19%.  Profits at JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, and other banks were hurt by massive expense provisions for expected loan losses due to the pandemic. Low interest rates fostered by the Federal Reserve to support the economy also reduced lending margins.  Incentive compensation for Dimon and other top JPMorgan executives is largely composed of restricted stock instruments.  The bank also disclosed awards to other executives of restricted stock units, indicating their total compensation for 2020, including:  Gordon Smith, co-president and CEO of Consumer & Community Banking, $22.5 million, unchanged from the year before.

Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak, $12 million, up 20% for her first full year as CFO.","94":"(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N executives are cautiously optimistic that the coronavirus pandemic will not send the economy into the worst possible tailspin, and feel confident enough in the bank\u2019s financial position to start repurchasing shares again soon if regulators allow.  Their comments came on Tuesday after JPMorgan reported much stronger-than-expected results for the third quarter, beating profit estimates and setting aside relatively little money for loan losses.  Only one of its four major units \u2013 consumer banking \u2013 saw revenue and profits decline, and even those customers are holding up relatively well, Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said. Other businesses, including trading, investment banking, commercial lending and wealth management, posted gains.  Although JPMorgan expects loan losses to escalate, and added another $611 million to its loan loss reserves, that figure is tiny compared to the previous quarter and smaller than what many analysts had expected.  JPMorgan has the financial wherewithal to handle those losses and start buying back shares again if regulators will allow it, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said. The Federal Reserve has ordered big banks to halt buyback programs and limit dividends through year-end.  \u201cWe\u2019ll be patient, but we have tremendous amount of wherewithal to do both when the time comes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I hope we\u2019re allowed to do it before the stock is much higher.\u201d  JPMorgan shares fell 1.8% to $100.57 in morning trading. The stock is down 27.4% year-to-date.  As the largest U.S. bank and one of the biggest global lenders, JPMorgan\u2019s results are viewed as a barometer of the economy and financial markets.  Its profit rose 4% to $9.4 billion, or $2.92 per share, in the third quarter, compared with $9.1 billion, or $2.68 per share, in the year-ago period.  Analysts had expected its profit to fall, with a consensus estimate of $2.23 per share, according to Refinitiv.  JPMorgan\u2019s revenue fell slightly to $29.9 billion, but still came in ahead of expectations.  Trading was a bright spot for the third consecutive quarter, as market volatility caused volumes to swell. Revenue there jumped 30% to $6.6 billion.  Analysts cheered the results. Evercore ISI\u2019s Glenn Schorr called JPMorgan \u201cthe Rickey Henderson of banks,\u201d a reference to a celebrated Major League Baseball star.  \u201cJPMorgan put up as strong of a quarter as we could have hoped for,\u201d he wrote in a note to clients.  Executives were careful not to offer too sunny an outlook, especially because Congress has failed to pass another stimulus bill. Lockdowns intended to prevent the virus from spreading have put millions out of work and shuttered thousands of businesses, causing the worst recession in decades.  JPMorgan looks at a range of possible economic outcomes when setting aside reserves, executives said. While its \u201cbase\u201d case has improved from the second quarter, it could very well deteriorate again.  \u201cThere\u2019s so much uncertainty,\u201d said Dimon. \u201cIf better outcomes happen, we are over-reserved by $10 billion. If the double-dip happens, we would be under-reserved by $20 billion.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: A view of the exterior of the JP Morgan Chase & Co. corporate headquarters in New York City May 20, 2015. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  So far this year, JPMorgan has added $19.4 billion to its credit loss provisions, more than four times the comparable figure for 2019.  Low interest rates hurt JPMorgan\u2019s results in a predictable way, as the U.S. Federal Reserve is keeping rates at nearly zero to offset the impact of the pandemic.  JPMorgan\u2019s net interest income fell 9% to $13.1 billion in the third quarter and its net interest margin dropped to 1.82%. Those metrics are closely watched by investors to show how much central-bank rate policies are affecting income, and how well banks are managing their balance sheets.  JPMorgan maintained its forecast for full-year interest income at about $55 billion, but said adjusted annual expenses will be about $66 billion, worse than its prior forecast of $65 billion.  JPMorgan\u2019s results came in contrast to Citigroup Inc C.N, which also reported earnings on Tuesday. Citigroup beat analyst estimates but executives offered a less optimistic economic outlook, especially for its consumer business.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N, Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N and Bank of America Corp BAC.N are scheduled to report results on Wednesday, with Morgan Stanley MS.N on Thursday.","95":"LONDON\/PARIS (Reuters) - JPMorgan has secured additional office space on the outskirts of Paris to house up to 200 staff who could be billeted to the French capital at short notice, under plans to cope with the fallout from a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit, sources told Reuters.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The U.S. investment bank has expanded an existing lease at the temporary base so it can accommodate a swift transfer of crucial operations to the city by April 1 if Britain were to leave the EU without a deal on March 29, the sources familiar with the matter said.  The premises just outside central Paris would accommodate a mix of front, middle and back office employees that the bank considers to be vital to keeping its continental European business running smoothly. Staff earmarked to work out of the venue would do so on a temporary basis while the bank finalises longer term arrangements.  JPMorgan has also taken short-term leases on an undisclosed number of hotel rooms and apartments in Paris and several other European cities where staff may also be moved to if there was a disorderly \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit, one of the sources said.  JPMorgan declined to comment.  Britain is due to leave the EU in 29 days time, but has yet to agree an exit deal. The chances of a no-deal Brexit at the end of March have fallen after Prime Minister Theresa May said she would allow lawmakers to vote on whether to accept her proposed deal or else have a small extension to the leave date.  Speaking at the Economic Club of New York in January, JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said the bank had spent hundreds of millions of dollars preparing for Brexit and was ready for all eventualities.  If there is a no deal staff will remain in place at the temporary site in Paris until the Wall Street heavyweight progresses plans to secure additional prime real estate in the city, preferably close to its existing offices in the city\u2019s famous Place Vendome.  JPMorgan has been resident in Place Vendome since 1916 but there is not enough space to accommodate its \u2018Day 1\u2019 Brexit team there, and not enough time to fit out other more permanent addresses under consideration, including Hotel de la Marine on Place de la Concorde, the sources said.  With one of the most competitive and expensive prime office markets in Europe, JPMorgan is unwilling to rush into signing a long-term lease on a large new base in Paris, especially if a lengthy Brexit transition deal is confirmed.  During a transition, European regulators are expected to give greater clarity on the scale and scope of operations international banks will be required to have in the EU compared with their existing European headquarters in London.","96":"LONDON (Reuters) - Kazakhstan has chosen JP Morgan JPM.N and VTB Capital VTBR.MM to lead the international listing of Kazakhtelecom KZTK.KZ, the country's largest telecoms operator, two financial sources familiar with the matter said.

Dimon, 63, has been CEO of JPMorgan for over a decade, and is a larger-than-life figure on Wall Street. Dimon\u2019s health scare raised new questions about who will succeed him for the long term.

The bank is changing its Chase Premier Platinum accounts, which require a minimum of $75,000 in deposits and certain investments, into Sapphire Banking accounts, spokeswoman Elizabeth Seymour said by phone.  The new accounts will offer special access to sports and entertainment events as do its Sapphire Reserve credit cards.  The Reserve card became a big hit with millennials eager to travel when it was introduced in 2016 with generous sign-up and spending bonuses, and access to travel lounges.  The new bank accounts will also eliminate some of the fees that can annoy consumers, including those for wire transfers and foreign exchange at overseas ATMs.  Later this year the bank will offer its Ultimate Rewards points, which it pays for credit card spending, as a sign-up incentive to new customers to Sapphire Banking accounts, Seymour said.  The new account is another example of JPMorgan cutting prices and offering additional services to attract customers and take market share from competitors.  On Tuesday the bank rattled the discount brokerage industry by offering free stock trades for self-managed accounts through its Chase mobile banking app.  The launch of the Sapphire Reserve card disrupted the high-end credit card business and resulted in higher-than-expected start-up expenses for JPMorgan.  JPMorgan has also taken market share in securities lending with aggressive pricing. It has won commercial banking business by opening new offices in cities outside its established markets.  JPMorgan has previously used tie-ins with Sapphire Reserve to promote its mortgage loans.  The bank aims to grow its consumer deposits more quickly than the industry.

REUTERS\/Sergio Perez\/File Photo  The move from Hesperia, which has said Minor\u2019s 6.3 euros per share offer for NH Hoteles was insufficient, comes as the Thai company nears majority control of NH with 45 percent of its share capital.  Derailing Minor\u2019s bid would be highly complicated at this stage. Spanish law dictates that a holder of more than 30 percent in any one company must launch a takeover offer, and the Thai firm is buying more NH shares every day.  U.S. operator Hyatt Hotels moved toward a takeover battle for NH in July, but backed away just three days later after Minor revealed the size of its stake.  One of the sources said JP Morgan, which advised China\u2019s HNA Group on the sale of a 26.5 percent stake in NH to Minor in June, had approached other potential investors to try to muster a counter offer.  \u201cThey realize it would be difficult, but they see some chance,\u201d the source said.  Minor\u2019s offer put a value of up to 2.5 billion euros ($2.9 billion) on NH, which runs more than 370 hotels in 30 countries. The offer has been approved by Spanish and Portuguese competition watchdogs, but NH said the offer undervalued it.  The mandate given by Hesperia to JP Morgan includes various options ranging from putting together a competing bid, to striking a partnership with Minor or simply selling the stake, the sources said.  Hesperia and JP Morgan declined to comment.  NH turned down a takeover in January from a different Spanish rival, Barcelo, which had valued it at 2.48 billion euros.

The IPO could value New York-based Perella at around $1.5 billion, however, no decision has yet been made and the company could decide to delay or forgo the IPO, according to the report.  Ahead of the IPO, the company is preparing to separate its asset-management division, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  Perella was founded in 2006, and currently manages about $15 billion in assets.  The company has been part of some of the biggest deals in the U.S., including SodaStream's SODA.TASODA.O $3.2 billion buyout by PepsiCo PEP.O and American International Group's AIG.N $5.56 billion acquisition of reinsurer Validus Holdings VR.N.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/Files\/File Photo  The bank plans to increase the number of its frontline private bankers in Latin America by 15 percent, the executive, Adam Tejpaul, said in an interview.  JPMorgan Private Bank employs 450 people in the region and most of then work as client advisers. BBVA Bancomer, Citi, Credit Suisse and Santander all have private banking businesses in Mexico as has the largest Mexican bank Banorte.  The bank\u2019s growth priorities are Mexico, Argentina and Colombia, Tejpaul said, although it also serves clients in Brazil, Chile, Peru and even Venezuela, despite the country\u2019s economic and political crisis.  Tejpaul said the increased regional headcount should help the bank to expand its client base by as much as 20 percent, although he declined to disclose more specific numbers.  \u201cMexico has had a lot of wealth creation and the number of wealthy individuals has increased materially,\u201d Tejpaul said.  Mexican telecom tycoon Carlos Slim and many other lesser known entrepreneurs have amassed fortunes over the past decades, although wealth tends to be unevenly distributed in Mexico, as is the case elsewhere in Latin America.  Tejpaul said the bank would offer more products and services to clients that wanted to pass on their wealth to future generations, including tax planning.  \u201cIf we think of Latin America as a whole, there is a lot of volatility in the capital market and political instability,\u201d Tejpaul said, adding that clients in emerging markets tend to be conservative with their investment decisions as a result.  Talks between Mexico, the United States and Canada to renegotiate the North America Free Trade Agreement dragged on for months last year, stalling at times. Leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador - now president - successfully campaigned in favor of a dramatic shift from the prior government\u2019s pro-market policies.  \u201cThis affects their perception of where and how they want to invest their wealth, more globally more locally,\u201d Tejpaul said.","118":"NEW YORK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon will not get a raise in his annual pay and will receive $31.5 million for his work in 2020, the bank said on Thursday.

SIA, which is being advised by Rothschild, has sent out requests for proposals to banks for potential roles in organising the deal and is looking to fill them in the coming weeks, the sources said.  It plans to issue shares worth 1 billion-1.5 billion euros ($1 bln-$1.6 bln) in a deal that could value the business at more than 4 billion euros excluding debt, another source said.  JPMorgan and UniCredit are expected to be frontrunners for the global coordinators spots, two of the sources said.  SIA, JPMorgan, Rothschild and UniCredit declined to comment.  SIA\u2019s listing comes after European initial public offerings (IPO) dropped to a seven-year low last year.  Yet European stock markets are near record highs boosting investors confidence and offering a window of opportunity for IPO candidates after a flurry of secondary share sales were well received this year.  Milan-based SIA is controlled by state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti through investment vehicle FSIA Investimenti, which owns a 57% stake.  The company said earlier this month that it had started preparations for a Milan float which could take place before the summer.  SIA provides payment services for the banking sector and has the London Stock Exchange among its clients.  Its services include a capital markets software which aims at improving transparency during the IPO or rights issue process - though it is not clear if it will be used for the potential listing.  SIA, which has core earnings of 201 million euros, has also explored a tie up with another payments firm as an alternative option, said a source. Its bigger rival Nexi remains a possible merger partner, the sources said, adding the IPO is its main focus.  The payments sector has seen a flurry of deals in recent years, with Worldline\u2019s acquisition of Ingenico valued at 15 times expected core earnings.  In 2019, Fiserv Inc bought First Data Corp for $22 billion, while Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) secured control of Worldpay for about $35 billion.  Italy\u2019s Nexi has seen its share price rise nearly 90% since its IPO last year and trades at around 17 times expected core earnings, according to Refinitiv data, while Dutch company Adyen trades at a hefty 75 times.  \u201cThe global shift from cash to electronics payments is far from complete,\u201d said Jupiter fund manager Guy de Blonay, adding European payment stocks are expected to keep rising this year.  \u201cOnline payments should continue to grow steadily,\u201d he said.","124":"LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan JPM.N is betting on a female banker to take the reins of its investment banking business in France as it seeks to bolster its leadership in one of Europe's hardest-hit markets from the coronavirus pandemic.  FILE PHOTO: An aerial view shows the Eiffel tower, the Seine River and the Paris skyline, France, July 14, 2019. REUTERS\/Philippe Wojazer  The Wall Street bank has snapped up Citigroup's C.N co-head of France investment banking, Maja Torun, to take on a similar job at the helm of its own franchise, according to a memo sent to staff which confirmed an earlier Reuters report.  Torun, who will start her new role in July, will also join the bank\u2019s France management committee.  The move comes as big banks and corporate boardrooms in Europe are trying to fill the gender gap and open up more top jobs for women.  JPMorgan kept a focus on diversity during its latest leadership reshuffling in February when it promoted two female bankers, Dorothee Blessing and Anu Aiyengar, to two power-sharing roles as co-head of EMEA investment banking and co-head of global M&A, respectively.  In her new Paris-based role Torun will be part of a small circle of female banking leaders in the French capital which also includes BNP Paribas\u2019 Sophie Javary, Goldman Sachs\u2019s Anne Bizien and Citi\u2019s Laurence Parisot.  JPMorgan\u2019s France boss Kyril Courboin, who sent out the memo, said that Torun will mainly focus on deepening the bank\u2019s client franchise while working in close partnership with its existing senior team.  But Torun\u2019s appointment comes with the challenge of a bleak economic environment, with France bracing for a series of rescue deals, nationalizations and restructurings in the coming months.  The French economy sank 6% in the first quarter of 2020 in its sharpest slowdown since World War Two.  The novel coronavirus has forced the country into a prolonged lockdown, paralysing business activity and claiming more than 23,000 lives.  Torun, a specialist in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) who joined Citi in 2016 from Deutsche Bank, will lead JPMorgan\u2019s efforts to win business from cash-strapped companies seeking help to stay afloat and fend off pressure from a growing number of activist investors in France.  She fills a vacant role that will reunite her with a former Deutsche Bank colleague, Marc Pandraud, who has chaired JPMorgan\u2019s investment banking for France and Belgium since 2016.  Torun first met Pandraud at Merrill Lynch where they both worked before the financial crisis forced the bank into a rescue merger with Bank of America BAC.N.  She then rose through the ranks quickly at Citi, winning the top job as the bank's co-head of France investment banking alongside Emmanuel Regniez in 2019 and leaving her mark after Citi topped up M&A league tables in France last year ahead of Goldman Sachs GS.N and Morgan Stanley.  Torun worked on some of France\u2019s most prominent deals in recent years including the merger of Essilor and Luxottica and Publicis\u2019s acquisition of Epsilon.  Conor Hillery, who co-heads JPMorgan\u2019s EMEA investment banking unit, praised her ability to \u201cbuild trust with clients naturally,\u201d saying she was a \u201cfirst class adviser.\u201d  Torun, who holds an MBA from French business school INSEAD, will report to both Kyril Courboin, who runs France as senior country officer, and Tanguy Piret, who heads the banking business across France, Belgium and Luxembourg.","125":"MOSCOW, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Russian gas giant Gazprom sold almost half of its $1.25 billion Eurobond issue to U.S. investors, Yan Tavrovsky, head of JP Morgan in Russia and CIS, told Reuters on Monday.

The deal took place days after the U.S. Treasury lifted sanctions on major Russian companies Rusal and En+.  * \u201cAbout half of the book came in from American investors. This is the evidence that the market has a rather constructive attitude towards Russian borrowers, and Gazprom, in particular,\u201d Tavrovsky said.  * The rest of the demand came mostly from Europe, while less than 10 percent came from Russia and less than 3 percent from Asia, Kirill Kondrashin, head of debt capital markets at JP Morgan in Russia and CIS, added.  * According to Kondrashin, initial demand for Gazprom\u2019s Eurobond exceeded $5 billion, but this had declined to $3.5 billion by the time the book closed as the company had cut its yield guidance.  * It was the first Russian dollar-denominated Eurobond since February 2018 and Gazprom\u2019s largest dollar-denominated Eurobond since 2009, Tavrovsky said.  * \u201cThe demand was very high, it was obvious that investors were hungry for quality issues from Russia. In fact, Gazprom has opened the market for placements in dollars for Russian borrowers after a long break,\u201d he added.  * The share of U.S. dollar-denominated debt in Gazprom\u2019s net debt had fallen to 34 percent as of mid-2018 from 46 percent at the end of 2016, while the share of euro debt had risen to 38 percent from 34 percent.

Efforts have had mixed results, with few projects achieving significant impact.  JPMorgan built the Quorum blockchain internally using the ethereum network, the software that underpins ether, one of the most well known cryptocurrencies.  Quorum, which will remain open-source, is being used by the bank to run the Interbank Information Network, a payments network that involves more than 300 banks. The network and other bank projects running on Quorum will continue to operate using the platform, JPMorgan said.

The utility has been working for months on a plan to securitise part of the arrears and sell them to investors.

The unsecured creditors, who collected pennies on the dollar from GM\u2019s bankruptcy, have been trying for years to recoup some of the $1.5 billion that was paid to GM\u2019s secured lenders.  The $1.5 billion loan was syndicated to hundreds of investors who were defendants in the lawsuit. The individual settlement contributions by JPMorgan, a law firm that handled the paperwork and the investors in the loan were not disclosed in court documents.  JPMorgan declined to comment.  The dispute stemmed from the unintentional release of a lien on GM equipment due to a paperwork error.  At the end of 2008, the automaker was preparing to pay off a $300 million financing. The law firm handling the paperwork accidentally included a lien that secured the $1.5 billion loan in the list of security interests it terminated after the $300 million was repaid.  Releasing the lien rendered part of the loan unsecured, allowing a trustee working for unsecured creditors of GM to try to claw the money back.  The mistake did not invalidate all liens securing the $1.5 billion loan, and the parties have spent years disputing whether GM assets such as robots and conveyor belts secured loan.

Investors have been concerned about the status of PDVSA debt after Washington imposed sweeping sanctions on the company earlier this year.  JPMorgan, which declined to comment on its monthly rebalancing, also sent out a survey to its clients asking more specific questions about Venezuela, Tina Vandersteel, Boston-based head of emerging country debt at Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo & Co, told Reuters.  \u201cJPM had launched a survey, which I\u2019d completed, about what to do about VENZ. The feedback I gave them was, per their index liquidity rules, while the sanctions prevailed, they should be removed,\u201d Vandersteel said in an email.  At the end of January, PDVSA had a weight of 0.53 in JPMorgan\u2019s EMBI Global Diversified index while Venezuela Republic bonds were at 0.66, according to the index provider.  Reuters did not have access to February index weight data.  Venezuela - the country with the largest oil reserves in the world - has defaulted on most of its $63 billion of debt as it has spiralled into its worst-ever economic crisis. The International Monetary Fund has forecast inflation will hit 10 million percent this year.  Since the start of the year, bonds issued by Venezuela and PDVSA chalked up steady gains amid weeks of protests that saw pressure mount on President Nicolas Maduro.  However, trading in PDVSA bonds almost ground to a halt after Washington imposed a swathe of sanctions, including a ban on U.S. investors from trading in the secondary market, other than divestment.  JPMorgan communicates any changes of index constituents to its clients on the last trading day of the month. The EMBI Global index includes $24.1 billion of dollar-denominated PDVSA debt, according to the index provider.

REUTERS\/Chris Helgren  The testimony from former JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N markets head Jeff Herbert-Smith appears to be at odds with the prosecution's case that the three banks and their client Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ.AX agreed to withhold details about a A$2.5 billion ANZ share sale in 2015 to support the stock.  The case, in which JPMorgan has been given immunity in exchange for cooperating with the authorities, is being closely watched by investment banks around the world because it could influence how they are allowed to conduct capital raisings.  Prosecutors have argued that discussions on two conference calls in August 2015 between bankers on the deal amounted to an agreement to not tell investors that underwriters were buying some of the stock.  But Herbert-Smith, who was on the calls, told a Sydney court in a pre-trial hearing that the staff of the three banks decided to withhold information about the share sale independently and there was no agreement.  \u201cI had 30 seconds\u2019 notice, and three seconds to make up my mind,\u201d Herbert-Smith said of one of the calls.  \u201cI was flying blind on the phone call.\u201d  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Seven months later, in March 2016, when he was told the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) wanted to speak to him, Herbert-Smith said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it, I was somewhat surprised\u201d.

According to his lawyer, Herbert-Smith told other bankers on the call that \u201cwe are comfortable with our risk position (and) we are going to stand on it\u201d.  \u201cThere was no prior agreement ... relating to those lines you\u2019ve just recited,\u201d Herbert-Smith said.  Herbert-Smith said that when he met an ACCC investigator in March 2016, the investigator found it hard to believe three people on the same call made the same decision independently.  \u201cI disagreed. Maybe it was familiarity with capital markets,\u201d he said.  Defence lawyers have been questioning Herbert-Smith and two other JPMorgan staffers involved in the stock issue to determine how they came to give their sworn witness statements and who was involved. The defense has previously suggested the JPMorgan evidence may have been contaminated by the involvement of the ACCC and other regulators.  On Thursday, Herbert-Smith said he met the ACCC about six times before signing a statement that would be used to prosecute the other banks, he said.  The banks and their staff and former staff have declined to comment on the case outside of what is said in court. All of the accused have said they will defend the case, which is yet to go to trial, but none has entered a formal plea.

Chinese data showed exports rebounded in March, lifting U.S. and euro zone bond yields to three-week highs and helping offset weaker imports and reports of another cut to German growth forecasts.  Investors are looking for signs of a Chinese economic recovery to temper global growth worries, especially after the International Monetary Fund this week downgraded its 2019 world economic outlook for the third time.  China\u2019s trade results, as well as credit data, have helped boost risk appetite and reinforce the stabilization thesis, which should have spill-over effects for the global economy, said Candice Bangsund, a portfolio manager with the global asset allocation team at Fiera Capital in Montreal.  \u201cThe whole China situation really appears to be gaining some ground,\u201d Bangsund said. \u201cWe saw a very impressive rebound in exports; this of course is helping alleviate fears of a hard landing.\u201d  MSCI\u2019s gauge of equity market performance in 47 countries gained 0.37%, while the EURO STOXX 50 index rose 0.31%.

U.S. banks are benefiting from a cut in corporate tax rates, hikes in interest rates and a growing economy that is driving demand from borrowers while holding down loan loss rates.  \u201cWe see good global economic growth, particularly in the U.S., where consumer and business sentiment is high,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said.  Overall, the bank\u2019s revenue rose 6.5 percent to $28.39 billion and topped the average analyst estimate of $27.36 billion, driven by growth in all four of the bank\u2019s businesses.  Shares of the largest U.S. bank by assets were up 1 percent in premarket trading.  JPMorgan\u2019s quarterly reports are closely watched for signs about the health of consumers and businesses as the lender plays a major role in several businesses, such as home mortgages, commercial lending and asset management.  Average core loans, which include consumer credit and loans to the biggest corporations, were up 7 percent compared with the year-earlier quarter.  Analysts and economists are watching loan demand at banks for signs of any impact from international trade tariffs on their business and expansion plans.  Investors have also been looking for signs that the corporate tax cuts have given companies new confidence to borrow, a phenomenon that bankers have said might not show up before the second half of the year.  Earlier this week, Dimon was quoted in an Italian newspaper saying that U.S. business executives have warned U.S. President Donald Trump that the impact of trade tariffs on economic growth could offset the benefits of tax cuts.  Trading revenue, which makes up about a fifth of JPMorgan\u2019s total revenue, was up 13 percent, compared with a 1 percent gain expected by Credit Suisse analyst Susan Roth Katzke.  In May, the bank\u2019s corporate and investment bank chief, Daniel Pinto, said second-quarter markets revenue was likely to be flat compared with a year earlier.  Net interest income rose 10 percent as the U.S. Federal Reserve raised benchmark interest rates four times since the second quarter of 2017.  Net income rose 18.3 percent to $8.32 billion, or $2.29 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $7.03 billion, or $1.82 per share, a year earlier.

Brent futures rose 18 cents, or 0.4%, to $43.52 a barrel by 11:56 a.m. EDT (1556 GMT), while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 14 cents, or 0.3%, to $41.33.  Both contracts were on track for weekly gains of about 10% this week, their first increase in three weeks.  Prices turned from slightly negative to slightly positive following news that U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin planned to hold talks later in the day amid ongoing negotiations for further COVID-19 federal aid package.  Pelosi said she hopes the Democrats and the administration can reach a deal soon.  In Norway, oil workers could end their 10-day strike later on Friday if a set of new proposals from the oil industry proves satisfactory, the head of the Lederne trade union told Reuters.  An escalation of the strike could almost triple the existing outage if no solution is reached by Oct. 14, taking the total capacity cut to about 934,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day.  Hurricane Delta, meanwhile, has shut 1.67 million barrels per day, or 92%, of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil output, the most since 2005 during Hurricane Katrina.  \u201cWe believe we are soon in for an oil price correction when the Norway strike is resolved and when the hurricane in the U.S. goes away ...

REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/Files\/File Photo  This is the third time the group has advocated voting against JPMorgan\u2019s executive compensation since the Dodd-Frank law mandated shareholders be given a say on pay in 2010. Each time, ISS has cited discretionary compensation as a concern.  JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, did not immediately provide comment on the ISS view.  The bank\u2019s board of directors recommended in its proxy filing that shareholders vote to approve executive compensation at its shareholder meeting next week in Chicago, based on the company\u2019s strong business results, risk controls and conduct, customer and stakeholder focus, and leadership in 2018.  The influential proxy advisory firm said that although JPMorgan\u2019s compensation committee uses performance assessments to guide the amount of discretionary compensation awarded, certain \u201cfactors assessed were described only vaguely and appear subjective.\u201d  \u201cInvestors increasingly prefer an incentive program structure that constrains discretion in favor of emphasis on objective and transparent determinations that are more compatible with pay-for-performance,\u201d ISS wrote.  ISS said it was also concerned about the vesting of one part of the pay plans described as performance share units.  ISS previously advised voting against executive pay in 2015 because it objected to a discretionary cash bonus, and in 2011 because it said the chief executive pay was \u201csignificantly above-median\u201d and the discretionary components reduced the focus on performance.  JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who has led the bank since 2005, received a total of $31 million in compensation for the year 2018, $1.5 million more than in 2017. His compensation included an annual base salary of more than $1.5 million and performance-based incentives of $29.5 million.  The shareholder vote on executive compensation next week is ultimately nonbinding. However, the bank\u2019s board said in its 2019 proxy statement that it will consider the results of the vote when making future compensation arrangements.  In Britain, Standard Chartered faced investor criticism at its annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday after roughly a third of votes were cast against its executive compensation plans.  Standard Chartered\u2019s pay plans differ significantly from U.S. banks.

FILE PHOTO: Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar arrives at the European Union leaders summit in Brussels, Belgium, June 20, 2019. Julien Warnard\/Pool via REUTERS  Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Thursday a withdrawal agreement could be clinched by the end of October, which would allow the United Kingdom to leave the European Union in an orderly fashion.  EU negotiator Michel Barnier and his British counterpart Stephen Barclay, meanwhile, held a \u201cconstructive\u201d meeting on Friday, both the British and EU sides said.  The pound, British stocks, bonds, and Irish government bonds rallied as investors scrambled to cover short positions, with the British currency hitting its highest levels in more than three months. It was trading at $1.2675 at 1500 GMT. [GBP\/]  Deutsche Bank said it was no longer negative on the pound.  \u201cThis represents a significant change of tune by the Irish government, that has so far been relatively pessimistic about the prospect of talks moving forward,\u201d Deutsche\u2019s foreign exchange strategist, Oliver Harvey, told clients.  JPMorgan, meanwhile, predicted a deal would be struck, noting the two sides appeared to have found a solution to the thorny Irish border issue.  The bank now sees a 50% chance of a withdrawal agreement being struck with a \u201cmodified\/time-limited\u201d Irish \u201cbackstop\u201d that could get round a major sticking point over customs and border arrangements between Ireland and the UK province of Northern Ireland.  It had previously put the likelihood at just 5%.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Some remain doubtful. For one, time is short and any deal British Prime Minister Boris Johnson brings back from Brussels will need the British parliament\u2019s approval, including from hardline pro-Brexit factions.  The British government is therefore likely to request an extension to the Brexit deadline and then hold a general election, UBS Wealth Management said. But it acknowledged that the chances of a Brexit agreement had nonetheless increased.  \u201cThe chances of a deal seem to have improved and the pound has moved accordingly but hurdles still remain,\u201d said Dean Turner, economist at the wealth manager.  \u201cTime to thrash out the details of the deal are tight, and then there is the question of parliamentary approval.\u201d  A deal would prolong the rally in the pound, Turner said, predicting sterling would hit $1.35 and trade in the \u201clow 80s\u201d against the euro if there was an agreement.  Morgan Stanley upped its chances of a Brexit deal to 55% from 35% before the latest developments. The investment bank said a deal would be negotiable if London agreed to a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, although it was uncertain such an arrangement would be approved by the current parliament.  \u201cWe continue to see elections as the most plausible mechanism to decide the way forward on Brexit and expect them to be held before Brexit,\u201d the bank\u2019s economists Jacob Nell and Brunca Skarica wrote in a note to clients.  \u201cHowever, given that a Johnson government seems to have switched to supporting a negotiable deal, we now see a significantly reduced risk of a no-deal outcome after elections, since even a Johnson government would prefer an orderly exit to a no-deal outcome.\u201d  Goldman Sachs was ahead of the bunch, however, sending a recommendation late last Friday for clients to buy sterling against the dollar, with a target of $1.30 compared with the then spot pound value of around $1.23.  It assessed the probabilities of a Brexit deal being struck at 60%.  Political risk consultancy Eurasia Group raised its probability of a Brexit deal from 5% to 10%. But barriers to one were still substantial, it cautioned.","188":"NEW YORK, July 31 (Reuters) - The largest U.S. bank by assets, JPMorgan Chase & Co, lowered its prime rate, a benchmark for a wide range of consumer and commercial loans, for the first time in more than a decade on Wednesday, following a rate cut from the Federal Reserve.

JPMorgan was among the banks that left blockchain consortium R3 last year, while a partnership between Belgium-based settlement provider Euroclear and U.S. startup Paxos to develop a blockchain-based service for the London gold market was dissolved in July.  It remains unclear what the spin-off plans would mean for the JPMorgan employees that have been working on Quorum and whether they would join the new entity, one of the sources said.  Product development for Quorum has been led by Amber Baldet, an executive director of the bank\u2019s Blockchain Center of Excellence. Baldet could decide leave the firm and start a new venture, join the spun-off entity or stay at the bank, the source said. Baldet did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The bank had built Quorum internally using the Ethereum network, one of the most popular public blockchains.

Goldman Sachs slashed its 2020 growth forecast to -0.9% from 1.5% only two weeks ago, while JP Morgan went further to predict that Latin America\u2019s largest economy will shrink by 1.0%.  These are among the most gloomy outlooks for Brazil among the world\u2019s big banks, most of which had estimated growth of between 2.0 and 2.5% at the start of the year. The reversals were prompted by the scale of the coronavirus shock.  \u201cGlobal and domestic dynamics take a turn for the worse.

The forecasts came the same day Brazil\u2019s central bank cut interest rates by 50 basis points to a new low of 3.75%.

According to the filing, Berkshire owned $829 million of PNC stock, $460 million of the insurer Travelers, and $2.13 billion of Oracle, the database software company.  It also added to its sizable stakes in two earlier Buffett investments, Bank of America Corp and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  \u201cWhile nervous investors fear the end of the economic recovery, Mr. Buffett is buying economically sensitive bank stocks,\u201d said Bill Smead, who runs Smead Capital Management Inc in Seattle and owns Berkshire stock. \u201cIt makes owners like us not mind sitting through a correction with them.\u201d  Though the filing did not say which individual purchases Buffett or his investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler were responsible for, investors watch Berkshire\u2019s quarterly stock listings for signs about where the trio sees value.

JPMorgan and Travelers declined to comment. PNC, Oracle and Buffett\u2019s assistant did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The investment in JPMorgan, where Combs is a board member, closes a notable hole in Berkshire\u2019s portfolio.  Berkshire had already been the largest investor in several companies, including American Express Co, Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon Corp, US Bancorp and Wells Fargo & Co, according to Refinitiv data.  Buffett has long praised the leadership of JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, and over the last year partnered with him and Amazon.com Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bezos to create a new company aiming to cut U.S. employee healthcare costs.  Atul Gawande, a surgeon and critic of medical industry practices, was named in June to lead the venture.  Buffett and Dimon also teamed up in June to call on companies to stop giving quarterly earnings forecasts, because they encourage an unhealthy focus on short-term profit at the expense of sustainable long-term growth.  Berkshire has more than 90 businesses in the insurance, energy, food and retail, industrial, railroad and other sectors.  Buffett, however, has not made a major acquisition since buying aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts in January 2016.  He often buys stocks such as Apple Inc, in which Berkshire previously disclosed a $57.6 billion stake, when buying whole companies appears too expensive.  Berkshire also spent $928 million repurchasing its own stock in the quarter.  Despite the stock purchases, Berkshire ended September with $103.6 billion of cash and equivalents.

Most of the employees at the site will work for JPMorgan\u2019s Chase Merchant Services division, which is the second-biggest U.S. processor of card payments for merchants.  The division last year bought WePay, a young Silicon Valley-based firm that specializes in connecting payment software with bank networks. WePay now has about 275 employees, who will move to the new building. WePay\u2019s co-founder Bill Clerico said the bank will also hire hundreds of people for new jobs at the site.  This year, JPMorgan made its digital products strategy a major theme of its annual February conference for investors and stock analysts.  The bank, the largest in the U.S. by assets, has said it believes that handling more payments for consumers and companies will bring it more of their deposit and loan business.  Matt Kane, chief executive of JPMorgan\u2019s merchant services division, said the bank was prepared to pay the high costs of operating in Silicon Valley for the chance to hire local software engineers.

The largest U.S. bank said it expects to process a total of $29 billion in loans for around 239,000 customers as part of the government\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The average of these loans is for $123,000, according to a press release.  Congress gave the Small Business Administration (SBA) nearly $660 billion over the past two months for government-guaranteed, forgivable loans that businesses hurt by the epidemic could apply for at participating banks.  Faced with high demand from many of the country\u2019s roughly 30 million small businesses, the program\u2019s success was hindered by technology failures, a lack of clarity on the rules and paperwork required, and by banks\u2019 struggles to quickly launch platforms to process the high volume of loan requests.  \u201cThousands of dedicated (staff) worked tirelessly over the past 30+ days to support the federal government in one of the largest and most ambitious emergency lending facilities in history,\u201d JPMorgan Chairman and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in a statement.  Big banks have faced criticism from policymakers for approving loans to businesses considered to be at the larger end of the small businesses range. This fueled concerns that the program\u2019s funds would be exhausted before smaller, needier companies could apply.  Congress attempted to address this concern this week by ring-fencing $30 billion for banks with less than $10 billion in assets. But pent-up demand meant those funds were exhausted by Tuesday.  For its part, JPMorgan said on Friday that half of the PPP loans it processed went to companies with fewer than 5 employees, and 75% of the loans were for less than $100,000.  \u201cWe\u2019ve followed (the government\u2019s) direction to deploy this relief as quickly as possible and agree with their tightening of eligibility requirements so that funding goes to those that need it most,\u201d Chief Executive of Chase Business Banking Jennifer Roberts said in a statement.","218":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, the country's largest lender by assets, is raising borrowing standards this week for most new home loans as the bank moves to mitigate lending risk stemming from the novel coronavirus disruption.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar  From Tuesday, customers applying for a new mortgage will need a credit score of at least 700, and will be required to make a down payment equal to 20% of the home\u2019s value.  The change highlights how banks are quickly shifting gears to respond to the darkening U.S. economic outlook and stress in the housing market, after measures to contain the virus put 16 million people out of work and plunged the country into recession.  \u201cDue to the economic uncertainty, we are making temporary changes that will allow us to more closely focus on serving our existing customers,\u201d Amy Bonitatibus, chief marketing officer for JPMorgan Chase\u2019s home lending business, told Reuters.  The bank was the fourth largest U.S. mortgage lender in 2019, according to industry publication Inside Mortgage Finance.  The changes should help JPMorgan reduce its exposure to borrowers who unexpectedly lose their job, suffer a decline in wages, or whose homes lose value. The bank said the change will also free up staff to handle a surge in mortgage refinance requests, which are taking longer to process due to staff working from home and non-essential businesses being closed.  Refinancing requests jumped to their highest level in more than a decade last month as average rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, the most popular home loan, fell to near record lows, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA).  JPMorgan would not disclose the current minimum requirements for its various mortgage products, but the average down payment across the housing market is around 10%, according to the MBA.  The new credit standards do not apply to JPMorgan\u2019s roughly four million existing mortgage customers, or to low and moderate income borrowers who qualify for its \u201cDreaMaker\u201d product, which requires a minimum 3% down payment and 620 credit score.  The U.S. housing market had been on a steady footing earlier this year, but with a deepening recession and would-be home buyers unable to view properties or close purchases due to social distancing measures, the health crisis now threatens to derail the sector.  The residential mortgage market is already under strain after borrower requests to delay mortgage payments rose 1,900% in the second half of March, Reuters reported.  The National Association of Realtors last month said home sales could fall by around 10% in the short-term, compared to historical sales for this time of year.

A view of the exterior of the JP Morgan Chase & Co. corporate headquarters in New York City May 20, 2015. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/Files  The bank will contribute $30 million over five years to programs to teach job skills and expand small businesses in Seine-Saint-Denis and other places with high unemployment and poverty, JPMorgan said in a statement provided to Reuters.  Located north of Paris, Seine-Saint-Denis has the highest poverty and crime rates in France. Dotted with large social housing projects, the area is separated from wealthy Paris only by an extremely congested highway circling the city. The area was in the center of the riots that devastated suburbs all over France a decade ago.  CEO Jamie Dimon planned to follow the announcement with a visit to the city on Tuesday. Dimon has been leaving more day-to-day operations of the New York-based bank to lieutenants while he promotes policies and public-private partnerships which he believes will promote economic growth.  His advocacy work has been primarily in the United States where JPMorgan earns about 80 percent of its revenue.  The Paris effort is part of JPMorgan\u2019s \u201cAdvancing Cities\u201d program, which builds on investments of $150 million in Detroit and $40 million in Chicago, cities where JPMorgan has the biggest market share of bank deposits.  JPMorgan executives have said they want more business abroad, particularly commercial lending to mid-sized companies.  JPMorgan employs about 200 people in France among some 255,000 worldwide.  JPMorgan employees in Paris work in investment banking, money management and capital markets. They do not serve low-income individuals or small businesses who could be the first to benefit from the new effort.  Peter Scher, JPMorgan Head of Corporate Responsibility, said the program will provide workers the skills needed by the bank\u2019s business clients, some of which are in office towers near areas where unemployment rates reach 35 percent.  \u201cThat is a good bet for the economy and it is a good bet for our firm,\u201d said Scher.  The job training will focus on the construction, information technology and environmental sustainability industries which are important in France, he said.  The $30 million for Paris is part of $500 million JPMorgan said in September that it would spend in as many as 30 cities, including some outside of the United States.  JPMorgan reported net income in 2017 of $24.4 billion.","260":"LONDON (Reuters) - JP Morgan will cut Venezuela\u2019s sovereign and state oil firm PDVSA\u2019s bonds to \u2018zero weight\u2019 in its widely-followed debt indexes over the next five months, the bank said on Tuesday, after U.S. sanctions halted nearly all trading in them.  The U.S. investment bank\u2019s index arm said the phasing-out process would start on July 31 and be completed by Nov. 29, although technically the debt will remain part of the indexes and pricing will also be maintained for the time being.  Venezuela\u2019s weight in the EMBI Global Diversified, EMBI Global and EMBI+ indices is currently 0.5%, 0.9% and 1.2% respectively. As a result of weighting cut, JP Morgan estimated the average yields on the EM indices would drop by some 45 basis points.  It will now trigger forced selling of the bonds into what is already a largely frozen and illiquid market.  Trading in Venezuelan and PDVSA debt [PDVSA.UL] ground to a halt this year after Washington imposed sweeping sanctions on Venezuela in a bid to force President Nicolas Maduro and his allies from power.  \u201cThose funds who do have the bonds will have to sell,\u201d said Abhishek Kumar lead EM portfolio manager at State Street Global Advisors.  \u201cYou do not want to be holding an overweight position in a country that is not in the benchmark.\u201d  He added it was likely to be a struggle as the sanctions mean they cannot be sold to U.S. investors.  \u201cThere is always a buyer at the right price, but it will definitely be a time consuming process,\u201d he said.  That expectation of forces selling has seen Venezuela\u2019s government bonds marked down to around 15 cents in the dollar from almost 30 cents early last month. PDVSA 2027 bonds are also trading at around 15 cents having been at 20 cents a month ago.  Opposition leader Juan Guaido, who declared himself interim president on Jan. 23, has received the backing of the United States, along with most other countries in the western hemisphere.

SIA, which is being advised by Rothschild ROTH.PA, has sent out requests for proposals to banks for potential roles in organizing the deal and is looking to fill them in the coming weeks, the sources said.  It plans to issue shares worth 1 billion-1.5 billion euros ($1 bln-$1.6 bln) in a deal that could value the business at more than 4 billion euros excluding debt, another source said.  JPMorgan JPM.N and UniCredit CRDI.MI are expected to be frontrunners for the global coordinators spots, two of the sources said.  SIA, JPMorgan, Rothschild and UniCredit declined to comment.  SIA\u2019s listing comes after European initial public offerings (IPO) dropped to a seven-year low last year.  Yet European stock markets are near record highs boosting investors confidence and offering a window of opportunity for IPO candidates after a flurry of secondary share sales were well received this year.  Milan-based SIA is controlled by Italian state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) through investment vehicle FSIA Investimenti, which owns a 57.42% stake.  CDP also owns 25.69% of SIA via its holding CDP Equity which gives the state lender an overall exposure of slightly more than 83%.  Italian lender Banco BPM and asset manager Banca Mediolanum control 5.33% and 2.85% of SIA, respectively, while Deutsche Bank has 2.58% of the company.  The company said earlier this month that it had started preparations for a Milan float which could take place before the summer.  SIA provides payment services for the banking sector and has the London Stock Exchange among its clients.  Its services include a capital markets software which aims at improving transparency during the IPO or rights issue process - though it is not clear if it will be used for the potential listing.  SIA, which has core earnings of 201 million euros, has also explored a tie up with another payments firm as an alternative option, said a source. Its bigger rival Nexi NEXII.MI remains a possible merger partner, the sources said, adding the IPO is its main focus.  The payments sector has seen a flurry of deals in recent years, with Worldline\u2019s acquisition of Ingenico valued at 15 times expected core earnings.  In 2019, Fiserv Inc FISV.O bought First Data Corp for $22 billion, while Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) FIS.N secured control of Worldpay for about $35 billion.  Italy's Nexi has seen its share price rise nearly 90% since its IPO last year and trades at around 17 times expected core earnings, according to Refinitiv data, while Dutch company Adyen ADYEN.AS trades at a hefty 75 times.  \u201cThe global shift from cash to electronics payments is far from complete,\u201d said Jupiter fund manager Guy de Blonay, adding European payment stocks are expected to keep rising this year.  \u201cOnline payments should continue to grow steadily,\u201d he said.","264":"(Reuters) - Walter Shipley, a former banking executive credited with helping spur a series of mergers that led to the creation of JPMorgan Chase JPM.N, has died at age 83, the company said on Saturday.

The Wall Street bank has snapped up Citigroup\u2019s co-head of France investment banking, Maja Torun, to take on a similar job at its own franchise, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the matter is confidential.  JPMorgan and Citi declined to comment.  The move comes as big banks and corporate boardrooms in Europe are trying to fill the gender gap and open up more top jobs for women.  JPMorgan kept a focus on diversity during its latest leadership reshuffling in February when it promoted two female bankers, Dorothee Blessing and Anu Aiyengar, to two power-sharing roles as co-head of EMEA investment banking and co-head of global M&A, respectively.  In her new Paris-based role Torun will be part of a small circle of female banking leaders in the French capital which also includes BNP Paribas\u2019 Sophie Javary, Goldman Sachs\u2019s Anne Bizien and Citi\u2019s Laurence Parisot.  Her appointment comes with the challenge of a bleak economic environment, with France bracing for a series of rescue deals, nationalizations and restructurings in the coming months.  The French economy sank 6% in the first quarter of 2020 in its sharpest slowdown since World War Two.  The novel coronavirus has forced the country into a prolonged lockdown, paralyzing business activity and claiming more than 23,000 lives.  Torun, a specialist in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) who joined Citi in 2016 from Deutsche Bank, will lead JPMorgan\u2019s efforts to win business from cash-strapped companies seeking help to stay afloat and fend off pressure from a growing number of activist investors in France.  She will fill a vacant role that will reunite her with a former Deutsche Bank colleague, Marc Pandraud, who has chaired JPMorgan\u2019s investment banking for France and Belgium since 2016.  Torun first met Pandraud at Merrill Lynch where they both worked before the financial crisis forced the bank into a rescue merger with Bank of America.  She then rose through the ranks quickly at Citi, winning the top job as the bank\u2019s co-head of France investment banking alongside Emmanuel Regniez in 2019 and leaving her mark after Citi topped up M&A league tables in France last year ahead of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

They calculate that, despite buying from major central banks like the ECB, there will be a $840 billion reduction in bond demand in 2020 against a $375 billion decrease in bond supply.  \u201cThis implies upward pressure on bond yields next year, particularly if our estimates of bond fund demand and G4 (US, Eurozone, Japan, UK) commercial bank bond purchases for 2020 prove correct,\u201d JPMorgan\u2019s analysts wrote in a note.  Next year should also break a four-year trend of rising global bond supply.  The $375 billion reduction predicted by JPMorgan reflects both a decline in net government supply in the United States and a reduction of corporate issuance. Companies globally are trying to rein in their debt having pre-financed on the back of record-low interest rates in recent years.  This year has seen bond supply rise to just over $3.1 trillion, the highest level since 2009. Over the past four years, annual global bond supply has gone up by almost $1 trillion.

His lawyer, Florian Miedel, declined to comment on the case.  Tyurin was arrested in the country of Georgia at the request of U.S. authorities last year, the latest of several people to be charged with taking part in the scheme.  JPMorgan disclosed that it had been hacked in 2014, saying it had exposed information associated with about 83 million customer accounts.  Other victims included E*Trade Financial Corp, Scottrade Inc and News Corp\u2019s Dow Jones & Co, publisher of the Wall Street Journal. Prosecutors said a total of more than 100 million customers of the hacked companies were affected.  Prosecutors had previously charged two Israeli citizens, Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein, along with an American resident of Israel, Joshua Samuel Aaron, in connection with the scheme.  Members of the conspiracy made hundreds of millions of dollars through criminal schemes using stolen information, prosecutors said.","276":"(Repeats without changes to headline or text)  MEXICO CITY, Jan 23 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co\u2019s private bank is expanding in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America, the unit\u2019s regional CEO said on Wednesday, as wealth creation and political changes bolster the sector\u2019s prospects.  The bank plans to increase the number of its frontline private bankers in Latin America by 15 percent, the executive, Adam Tejpaul, said in an interview.  JPMorgan Private Bank employs 450 people in the region and most of then work as client advisers. BBVA Bancomer, Citi, Credit Suisse and Santander all have private banking businesses in Mexico as has the largest Mexican bank Banorte.  The bank\u2019s growth priorities are Mexico, Argentina and Colombia, Tejpaul said, although it also serves clients in Brazil, Chile, Peru and even Venezuela, despite the country\u2019s economic and political crisis.  Tejpaul said the increased regional headcount should help the bank to expand its client base by as much as 20 percent, although he declined to disclose more specific numbers.  \u201cMexico has had a lot of wealth creation and the number of wealthy individuals has increased materially,\u201d Tejpaul said.  Mexican telecom tycoon Carlos Slim and many other lesser known entrepreneurs have amassed fortunes over the past decades, although wealth tends to be unevenly distributed in Mexico, as is the case elsewhere in Latin America.  Tejpaul said the bank would offer more products and services to clients that wanted to pass on their wealth to future generations, including tax planning.  \u201cIf we think of Latin America as a whole, there is a lot of volatility in the capital market and political instability,\u201d Tejpaul said, adding that clients in emerging markets tend to be conservative with their investment decisions as a result.  Talks between Mexico, the United States and Canada to renegotiate the North America Free Trade Agreement dragged on for months last year, stalling at times. Leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador - now president - successfully campaigned in favor of a dramatic shift from the prior government\u2019s pro-market policies.  \u201cThis affects their perception of where and how they want to invest their wealth, more globally more locally,\u201d Tejpaul said.

The cancellations could add pressure on other U.S. firms like Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N, Mastercard Inc MA.N and Bank of America Corp BAC.N to reconsider their plans to attend the investor event.  Neither JP Morgan nor Ford would elaborate on the reasons for the decision not to attend the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh later this month, and did not comment on whether concerns about the disappearance of Khashoggi were a factor.  Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist critical of Riyadh\u2019s policies, disappeared on Oct. 2 after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkey believes he was murdered and his body removed. Saudi Arabia has denied that.  The investment summit in Riyadh typically attracts executives from some of the world\u2019s largest companies and media organizations. But it has rapidly become a vehicle for those firms to express their concerns over Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance.  U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened \u201csevere punishment\u201d if it turns out Khashoggi was killed in the consulate, although he said Washington would be \u201cpunishing\u201d itself if it halted military sales to Riyadh.  Major news organizations such as CNN, the Financial Times, the New York Times, CNBC and Bloomberg have pulled out of the conference. The Fox Business Network, the lone Western news outlet still heading to the conference, told Reuters on Sunday it was reviewing that decision.

Representations of the Ripple, Bitcoin, Etherum and Litecoin virtual currencies are seen on a PC motherboard in this illustration picture, February 13, 2018. Picture is taken February 13, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The comments underscored widespread scepticism about the assets by established finance firms, while offering some succor for advocates of blockchain who are still waiting to see it take root.  Last year bitcoin, the original and biggest digital coin, lost nearly three quarters in value, putting the brakes on cautious curiosity from mainstream finance and investors that emerged during its vertiginous ascent in 2017.  JP Morgan said it was skeptical of the value of cryptocurrencies - suggesting the assets would only make sense in a dystopian scenario where investors have lost all faith in gold, the dollar, other major reserve assets and the global payments system.  \u201cEven in extreme scenarios such as a recession or financial crises, there are more liquid and less-complicated instruments for transacting, investing and hedging,\u201d it said in a report on on crypto and blockchain.  Using bitcoin futures trading volumes as a proxy, JP Morgan said participation by financial institutions in crypto markets had slipped over the last six months, with individuals taking up an increasing share of the market.  Pension funds and asset managers have largely stayed clear, despite some advances in market infrastructure that have seen safer methods to store digital money emerge, with most worried about volatility, security flaws and propensity for illicit usage.  The usage of cryptocurrencies for payments - the intended purpose of bitcoin - will remain \u201cchallenged,\u201d JP Morgan said, adding that it was unable to pinpoint any major retailers that accepted digital coins in 2018.  Marketplaces where small businesses and individuals have control over payment methods would prove most fertile ground for the spread of cryptocurrencies, it said, citing a Reuters analysis of the usage of bitcoin in commerce.  Bitcoin, which stood at around $3,565 in afternoon trade, is likely to have cost support at around $2,400, and could fall below $1,260 if a bear market persists, JPMorgan said.  The New York-based bank struck a more optimistic tone on blockchain.  The shared ledger technology, which can process and settle transactions in minutes without third-parties for checks, has the potential to cut costs for global banks and digitalize complex process, it said.  Trade finance would likely benefit from blockchain, the bank said, cautioning that the lack of integration between private platforms could present a stumbling block for wider use.","287":"Oct 23 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co has appointed Mike Gaito as global co-head of healthcare investment banking after Jeff Stute, who held that role, left to join rival investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners LP, people familiar with the matter said.

FILE PHOTO: Cutouts depicting images of oil operations are seen outside a building of Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA in Caracas, Venezuela January 28, 2019. REUTERS\/Carlos Garcia Rawlins\/File Photo  Investors have been concerned about the status of debt issued by Venezuela and its oil firm after Washington imposed sweeping sanctions earlier this year.  With the curbs, trade in Venezuelan debt has ground to a halt, leaving some investors concerned the price is not reflective of the assets\u2019 true value and making it harder for passive funds to accurately reflect the indexes.  JPMorgan, which declined to comment on its monthly rebalancing, had sent out a survey to its clients ahead of the rebalancing asking more specific questions about Venezuela, Tina Vandersteel, Boston-based head of emerging country debt at Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo & Co, told Reuters.  \u201cJPM had launched a survey, which I\u2019d completed, about what to do about VENZ. The feedback I gave them was, per their index liquidity rules, while the sanctions prevailed, they should be removed,\u201d Vandersteel said in an email.  Investment managers\u2019 willingness to support the eviction of Venezuelan debt from the indexes is also influenced by the flexibility of their funds\u2019 investment mandates.  A leading exchange-traded fund from BlackRock, the iShares JPMorgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF, for example, is allowed to invest up to 20 percent of its assets in securities not in the index, its prospectus showed.  Yet making changes to portfolios in reality is not easy.  \u201cTo actually exit the exposure is nearly impossible - especially for larger funds - as there is no trading,\u201d said Uday Patnaik, Head of Emerging Market Debt at Legal & General Investment Management.  \u201cPlacing the country weight to 0 percent while freezing the price of the securities makes the most sense,\u201d he added.  At the end of January, PDVSA had a weight of 0.53 in JPMorgan\u2019s EMBI Global Diversified index while Venezuela Republic bonds were at 0.66, according to the index provider.  Reuters did not have access to February index weight data.  Venezuela - the country with the largest oil reserves in the world - has defaulted on most of its $63 billion of debt as it has spiraled into its worst-ever economic crisis. The International Monetary Fund has forecast inflation will hit 10 million percent this year.  Since the start of the year, bonds issued by Venezuela and PDVSA chalked up steady gains amid weeks of protests that saw pressure mount on President Nicolas Maduro.

The new accounts will offer special access to sports and entertainment events as do its Sapphire Reserve credit cards.  The Reserve card became a big hit with millennials eager to travel when it was introduced in 2016 with generous sign-up and spending bonuses and access to travel lounges.  \u201cWe are focusing on customers who are starting to earn and save more,\u201d Thasunda Duckett, chief executive of Chase Consumer Banking, said in an interview. \u201cThey are reaching key milestones.\u201d  The new bank accounts will also eliminate some of the fees that can annoy consumers, including those for wire transfers and foreign exchange at overseas ATMs.  Later this year the bank will offer its Ultimate Rewards points, which it pays for credit card spending, as a sign-up incentive to new customers to Sapphire Banking accounts, Seymour said.  The new account is another example of JPMorgan cutting prices and offering additional services to attract customers and take market share from competitors.  On Tuesday the bank rattled the discount brokerage industry by offering free stock trades for self-managed accounts through its Chase mobile banking app.  JPMorgan has also taken market share in securities lending with aggressive pricing. It has won commercial banking business by opening new offices in cities outside its established markets.  The launch of the Sapphire Reserve card disrupted the high-end credit card business and resulted in higher-than-expected start-up expenses for JPMorgan.  JPMorgan has previously used tie-ins with Sapphire Reserve to promote its mortgage loans.  Duckett said the bank is working on other extensions of Sapphire in consumer banking. \u201cWe are just getting started. You can expect us to continue to iterate,\u201d she said.  The bank aims to grow consumer deposits more quickly than the industry. Low-cost deposits become more valuable to banks as interest rates rise on loans.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar  The testimony from former JPMorgan Chase & Co markets head Jeff Herbert-Smith in court is a blow to the prosecution, which is relying on JPMorgan to support a case that the three global investment banks engaged in criminal cartel behaviour in a A$2.5 billion share issue for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group in 2015.  The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which brought the charges, accuses Citi and Deutsche and their client, Australia\u2019s fourth-largest bank, of withholding details of the sale to support the stock\u2019s price. JPMorgan was given immunity in exchange for cooperating with the authorities.  In pretrial hearings in Sydney, three senior JPMorgan staffers said they began discussing possible immunity deals with the ACCC in 2016 and wrote witness statements months later.

In a meeting over three days in October 2016, Dewar, who still holds his position at JPMorgan, said ACCC staff showed him a draft on a screen \u201cso everybody could see\u201d.

Yet Lake has emerged as a front-runner to replace Dimon when he eventually retires, Reuters interviews with more than a dozen current and former executives show. Over her nearly six years as JPMorgan's chief financial officer Lake, 49, has taken on more and more responsibilities effectively becoming Dimon's understudy. She helps develop strategies for each of the bank's business units and oversees matters ranging from its annual stress test to employee cafeterias. Largely unknown outside JPMorgan when named CFO in 2012, Lake has worked in both the wholesale and retail businesses during 19 years there. \"She has been all over,\" Dimon, 62, said in an interview, describing Lake as an \"extraordinarily talented executive.\" \u201cShe has all of the qualities of a great leader,\u201d he said. Those include being demanding, drawing information out of people and recognizing talent within the 15,000 people she oversees. Dimon said she also challenges him when she believes he is wrong. Lake, who also spoke to Reuters, said she wanted to broaden her skillset in her next job and has made her ambitions clear to the board chaired by Dimon. She declined to predict whether she will be the next CEO. \"I want to be at this company 10 years from now and I will be quite open-minded about what the next step could look like,\" she said. \"I have told the board that I want to be here for the long-term.\" Dimon has been CEO for nearly 13 years, the longest tenure among major U.S. banks. He is a larger-than-life figure who steered JPMorgan through the financial crisis and regularly stands up to regulators and politicians. The question of who could succeed him has captivated Wall Street for years. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/2NbTiZo) Lake's standing has risen as other CEO candidates have left JPMorgan after growing impatient or getting on Dimon's wrong side, executives said. \"I would put my money on her above anybody else,\" said one longtime JPMorgan executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \"She knows the bank extremely well, with her role spanning all of our businesses and functions,\" said Gordon Smith, co-president of the company and chief executive of JPMorgan\u2019s consumer bank. Dimon, who has said he will step down in about five years, would not discuss Lake's chances. It is the board's choice, and there are other people who could also run the company, he said. And, Dimon cautioned, \"Things change...Everybody changes.\u201d JPMorgan has said it has a succession plan and that it strives to give executives experience in its different businesses, but it does not publicly disclose the details. Two people analysts often mention as possible successors if Dimon were to suddenly leave are Smith, 60, and the other co-president Daniel Pinto, 55, who runs the investment bank. Mary Erdoes, 51, chief of asset and wealth management, and Doug Petno, 53, chief of the commercial bank, have also been cited over the years. CRUCIAL ADVICE When former CFO Douglas Braunstein stepped down in 2012 in the wake of the \"London whale\" scandal in which a JPMorgan trader lost more than $6 billion, Lake was one of several executives interviewing for the CFO job. In the interview, Lake credited a colleague for a piece of advice she says helped her win the promotion: Tell Dimon how much you want the job and tell him how hard you will work for him. \"If you don't tell people you really want a job, then you have no shot,\u201d said Lake. Born in Maryland and raised by working-class parents in southern England, Lake joined JPMorgan\u2019s London office as chief financial officer for credit trading at age 30, after working on the JPMorgan account for PricewaterhouseCoopers accounting firm. She moved to the United States in 2004 as JPMorgan was merging with Bank One, which Dimon ran before becoming CEO of the combined organization. She worked on an expensive, multi-year drive to combine JPMorgan's data and accounting systems and the implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley accounting controls. She was controller of the investment bank during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and ran finances for the retail bank as the mortgage business went through drastic changes afterward. Dimon named her to the current post in November 2012 and colleagues were stunned by her intensity in preparing for her first quarterly results presentation in January. \"She always wants to understand the why behind the things she would say,\" recalled Sarah Youngwood, then head of investor relations. \"It is still happening to this day.\" Lake talks too fast for some people to keep up. \"That is because she thinks so fast, but she has slowed it down,\" said Youngwood, who now has Lake's old job of CFO for the consumer bank. Lake said she sometimes counts to herself to reduce the pace. Bank analysts say they welcome all of the information Lake packs into her presentations and they like that she is quick to thoroughly address questions on investor minds. For example, after Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden published a report in January 2015 asking whether JPMorgan should break itself up because of new regulations, Lake made a case that the bank would thrive because of its size. \"She is probably one of the most gifted CFOs around,\" Ramsden said. \u201cShe is really at the top of every dynamic at JPMorgan.\" Lake\u2019s speed, demands for information, and visual memory of numbers can intimidate new hires, people who work with her said. Dimon said he and Lake sometimes challenge one another to remember numbers down to one decimal point. \u201cWe have a lot of fun with each other,\u201d he said. Lake had her three children through a surrogate starting at the age 42 after she decided that, even without a partner, she wanted to be a parent. She said she realized after she became CFO that her story could inspire other career-driven women at the bank and she tells it frequently. One junior colleague described Lake\u2019s parenting decision as \u201cfearless.\u201d \u201cIt's too easy to say it's not convenient right now\u201d to have a child, said Lake. \u201cOn big life-changing decisions like that, you just have to go for it.\u201d In a nod to her expanding role, JPMorgan put Lake at center stage at its four-hour investor conference this year. Typically, all the business heads would give their own presentations, but this time, Lake spoke for an hour and a half, explaining strategies for each of JPMorgan\u2019s four segments and giving an overview of how the bank is using technology to cut costs and generate more revenue. Lake says she is ready to take on a different role at JPMorgan and that the next CEO\u2019s main challenge will be making sure JPMorgan remains the country\u2019s most profitable big bank. \"When you are a successful company,\" she said, \"you have to fight really hard to make sure you avoid complacency, arrogance, bureaucracy.\" (Reporting by David Henry Writing by Lauren Tara LaCapra Editing by Neal Templin and Tomasz Janowski)","302":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N will provide $500 million over five years to promote economic opportunities in selected cities, including some outside the United States, the bank said Wednesday.

By the end of the year, the bank plans to name a \u201cglobal city\u201d for its first targeted urban investment outside of the United States.

In the wake of the Federal Reserve\u2019s cautious shift due to signs of softness in the U.S. economy and the subsequent drop in 10-year Treasury yields, S&P 500 banks are seen posting year-on-year first-quarter earnings growth of 2.3%, down from 8.2% forecast six months ago, according to Refinitiv data.  (For an interactive graphic on evolving bank earnings estimates click, tmsnrt.rs\/2HOVt1D)  \u201cThe Fed pivoted so abruptly, which gives one pause about what they\u2019re saying about the economy,\u201d said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. \u201cFlat to falling interest rates are not good news for bank interest margins. It\u2019s not surprising that analysts are taking down earnings estimates.\u201d  The central bank\u2019s change in tack put the brakes on what had been a pattern of quarterly rate hikes, amid signs of slowing economic growth.  Slowdown jitters have also hit 10-year Treasury yields. The benchmark bond\u2019s yield hit a 15-month low in the first quarter, flattening the yield curve and narrowing the gap between the interest banks pay depositors and the interest they charge consumers, which is bad news for profits.  \u201cThat\u2019s why the estimates are going down,\u201d Carlson added. \u201c(Analysts are) fearful of interest margins for banks and there\u2019s an underlying concern about loan growth.\u201d  In the first three months of the year, the S&P 500 bounced back from a sell-off in December, gaining 13.1%, its biggest quarterly increase since 2009. But financials underperformed the wider market, gaining 7.9% in the quarter as the new low-interest-rate normal that boosted other sectors was a headwind for banks.  Since October, analysts have drastically lowered their expectations for S&P 500 earnings in 2019, with first-quarter estimates dropping from 8.1% growth to a year-over-year decline of 2.2%. That would mark the first quarter of negative growth since the earnings \u201crecession\u201d that ended in 2016.  The partial federal government shutdown in January and an expected drop in trading revenues provided additional impetus for analysts to cut first-quarter bank earnings estimates.  In a KBW note dated April 3, lead analyst Brian Kleinhanzl sees median year-on-year revenues from both equities and fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) trading to have dropped by 15% in the quarter.  \u201cWithin financials, the industry that\u2019s been hit hardest is capital markets,\u201d said Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Refinitiv on London. \u201cThose downward revisions have intensified over the last 90 days. Of the big 6 banks, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have seen the biggest declines\u201d in first-quarter earnings estimates.  But some analysts believe the effects on banks of a more accommodative Fed and the flattened yield curve are overstated.  Oppenheimer lead analyst Chris Kotowski wrote in a March 25 note \u201cto be sure, rates and the yield curve have had an effect on bank earnings.\u201d But he called the impact from the Fed\u2019s decision \u201ca minor one,\u201d and wrote that aside from these impacts, \u201cbank fundamentals are remarkably stable.\u201d  Recent history shows that large U.S. financial institutions have beat analyst estimates at a higher rate than the broader market. In the eight most recent quarters, the six banks have beat earnings estimates 83.3% of the time on average, compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 75.4% average beat rate. Additionally, bank revenues surprised to the upside 79.2% of the time, while S&P 500 company revenues came in ahead of analyst estimates 68.3% of the time, per Refinitiv data.  (For a graphic on 'U.S. banks beat\/miss track record' click, tmsnrt.rs\/2Vmv2DP)  In today\u2019s late-cycle reality, however, it is not clear that banks can beat even lowered expectations. Either way they should set the tone for what analysts predict will be a rocky earnings period.  \u201cPsychologically, these are bellwether companies that tend to drive sentiment,\u201d Dhillon added, suggesting that their quarterly reports are proxy indicators of corporate earnings health. \u201cBanks are up there.\u201d","305":"Sept 20 (Reuters) - Technology-focused investment bank Qatalyst Partners has hired Ethan Zweig, a JPMorgan Chase & Co managing director, to join its San Francisco-based banking team.

WeWork, a provider of co-work spaces with flexible leases that now has more than 50 locations in Manhattan, said in a blog post on Monday it signed a lease for 258,344 square feet at 21 Penn Plaza. The move makes it the largest private occupier of office space on the island with more than 5.3 million square feet.  JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, has 5.2 million square feet, according to brokerage Cushman & Wakefield.  Flexible space accounted for 12 percent of Manhattan leasing activity in the first six months of the year, according to brokerage CBRE, and WeWork was responsible for about half of that as companies in search of extra space embrace coworking. Flex space providers sign long-term leases with a landlord and then rent the leased space to clients on a short-term basis.

FILE PHOTO: A view of the exterior of the JP Morgan Chase & Co. corporate headquarters in New York City May 20, 2015. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  The landmark multi-agency settlement lifts a regulatory shadow that has hung over the bank for several years and marks a signature victory for the government\u2019s efforts to clamp down on illegal trading in the futures and precious metals market.  JPMorgan will pay $436.4 million in fines, $311.7 million in restitution and more than $172 million in disgorgement, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Tuesday, the biggest-ever settlement imposed by the derivatives regulator.  Between 2008 and 2016, JPMorgan engaged in a pattern of manipulation in the precious metals futures and U.S. Treasury futures market, the CFTC said. Traders would place orders on one side of the market which they never intended to execute, to create a false impression of buy or sell interest that would raise or depress prices, according to the settlement.  This manipulative practice, which is designed to create the illusion of demand, or lack thereof, is known as \u201cspoofing.\u201d  Some of the trades were made on JPMorgan\u2019s own account, while on occasions traders manipulated the market to facilitate trades by hedge fund clients, the CFTC said. The bank failed to identify, investigate, and stop the behavior, even after a new surveillance system flagged issues in 2014, the agency said.  \u201cThe conduct of the individuals referenced in today\u2019s resolutions is unacceptable and they are no longer with the firm,\u201d said Daniel Pinto, co-president of JPMorgan and CEO of the Corporate & Investment Bank.  He added that the bank had invested \u201cconsiderable resources\u201d in boosting its internal compliance policies, surveillance systems and training programs.  In parallel settlements, the bank entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the Department of Justice and the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Connecticut, staving off criminal prosecution on charges of wire fraud.  It also agreed to pay $35 million to settle related charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission, although the bank\u2019s payment to the CFTC would offset that fine, it said.  In an unusual concession, JPMorgan also admitted wrongdoing in agreeing to the SEC and Justice Dept. settlements.  \u201cThis record-setting enforcement action demonstrates the CFTC\u2019s commitment to being tough on those who intentionally break our rules, no matter who they are. Attempts to manipulate our markets won\u2019t be tolerated,\u201d said CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert.  The CFTC and Justice Department have taken aim at spoofing in recent years, using sophisticated data analysis tools to spot potential wrongdoing that it could not previously detect.  Reuters has reported that around 2017, the agency began using techniques it originally developed to spot healthcare fraud schemes to identify suspicious trading patterns, including by scanning activity on exchanges.  \u201cThe idea was: let\u2019s mine this data source to see who the worst actors are,\u201d Robert Zink, a top Justice official who helped lead the effort, told Reuters in May here.  The agency has already charged six JPMorgan traders for manipulating metals futures between 2008 and 2016. On Friday, meanwhile, two former Deutsche Bank AG traders were found guilty here by a federal jury of spoofing, the agency said.","311":"FILE PHOTO: People pass the JP Morgan Chase & Co.

Around 25 people currently work on the Quorum team globally, and it is unclear whether they will join ConsenSys after the merger, the people said.  Blockchain emerged over a decade ago as the software tracking cryptocurrency transactions. Since then, banks and other large corporations have been investing millions of dollars to develop and test a range of business applications using the nascent technology. Efforts have had mixed results, with few projects achieving significant impact.  JPMorgan built the Quorum blockchain internally using the ethereum network, the software that underpins ether, one of the most well known cryptocurrencies.  It is being used by JPMorgan to run the Interbank Information Network, a payments network that involves more than 300 banks. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, also said it would use Quorum to issue a digital currency called JPMorgan Coin that it designed to make instantaneous payments using blockchain.  A merger with ConsenSys would have no impact on the IIN and other JPMorgan projects running on Quorum, one of the people said.  JPMorgan has been considering spinning off Quorum for around two years, evaluating options including setting up an open-source foundation, creating a new startup or merging it with another company, the person said.  A merger with ConsenSys was chosen as the best path forward as both organizations work with ethereum and have been involved in joint initiatives in the past.  ConsenSys, a prominent blockchain startup that grew rapidly during the 2017 crypto bubble, was founded by Joe Lubin, one of the co-founders of ethereum. The company announced last week that it had laid off around 14% of its staff, as it undergoes a restructuring to separate its software development business from its venture activities.  A merger with Quorum would align with its shift toward growing its software division.  Quorum is open source, meaning its code is free and may be modified and redistributed. The plan after the merger is to maintain the Quorum brand and keep the technology open source, one of the people said.","315":"July 16 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co reported a 16% rise in quarterly profit as higher net interest income and a tax gain more than made up for lower activity at the bank\u2019s trading desks.

(Reporting by Elizabeth Dilts in New York and Sweta Singh in Bengaluru Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)","316":"(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday, easing fears that slowing economic growth could weigh on its results.  The largest U.S. bank by assets showed strength across its businesses in the first quarter, driven by what Chief Executive Jamie Dimon described as solid U.S. economic growth, moderate inflation and strong consumer and business confidence.  U.S. bank stocks have underperformed the broader market in recent months on fears of an impending recession, with economists and investors citing concerns over a flattening yield curve and slowing housing market. But bank executives have downplayed concerns, pointing to continuing loan growth.  \u201cThere is no law that says it has to stop,\u201d Dimon said when asked if the decade-long economic expansion is due to turn into a recession. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t count on there having to be a recession in the short run.\u201d  Loans in JPMorgan\u2019s consumer banking division rose 4 percent from a year ago. Overall revenue rose 4.7 percent to $29.85 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $28.44 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been generally quite optimistic about the outlook for the economy,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake told reporters on a call to discuss the results. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t diminish the fact that there are a number of risks out there. Right now we don\u2019t see that playing out in the data.\u201d  The bank\u2019s net interest margin, a key measure of loan profitability, edged up only 0.02 percent point from the fourth quarter, a slower pace of improvement than in the two previous quarters.  FILE PHOTO: People walk inside JP Morgan headquarters in New York, October 25, 2013. REUTERS\/Eduardo Munoz\/File Photo  Investors have been concerned that net interest margins may have peaked for the banks, since the Federal Reserve has signaled it is unlikely to raise short-term rates this year and the spread between short- and longer-term rates has narrowed.  While Lake did not directly answer if the lending spread had peaked after fueling profit growth for years, she said it will likely not get any better in the coming quarters. The bank expects it to remain constant, she said.  Unlike Wells Fargo & Co, the other big U.S. bank to report earnings on Friday, JPMorgan stood by its outlook for net interest income, a key driver of profits, which it expects to increase about 4 percent this year over 2018.  Wells said it now expects its NII to decline 2 to 5 percent instead of landing in a range of plus or minus 2 percent. The change sent Wells shares down as much 2.4 percent. Lake also reiterated the bank\u2019s 17 percent projection for return on average tangible common equity and said she does not anticipate the bank will raise it this year.  Lake downplayed questions about whether the bank\u2019s $90 million provision for credit losses in its commercial banking segment in the first quarter was a reason for concern.  \u201cThese downgrades were idiosyncratic. It was a handful of names\u201d of diverse commercial and industrial borrowers, she said. \u201cWe are not seeing signs of deterioration.\u201d  In the bank\u2019s capital markets business, equity underwriting fell 13 percent and bond trading revenues fell 8 percent from the year-ago quarter. Bank executives had signaled earlier in the quarter that capital markets revenue could fall by a greater amount.  Shares of the bank were up 3.6 percent in morning trading.  The bank said net income rose to a record $9.18 billion, or $2.65 per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $8.71 billion, or $2.37 per share, a year earlier.  Net interest income rose 8 percent to $14.60 billion, boosted by interest rate increases since the first quarter of last year.  Analysts had estimated earnings of $2.35 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.","317":"DUBAI, July 23 (Reuters) - JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley have been picked to advise on Saudi Aramco\u2019s potential acquisition of a stake in petrochemical maker SABIC , four sources familiar with the matter said.

The U.S. Treasury Department will sell $65 billion in one-month bills; $24 billion in one-year T-bills and $35 billion in five-year notes. They are part of this week's record high $294 billion in government debt for sale. Monday's $30 billion two-year note issue, along with $51 billion in three-month bills and $45 billion in six-month bills, drew mediocre demand, analysts said. Lingering worries about a trade war between the United States and China have supported safe-haven demand for Treasuries, though Wall Street stock prices rose for a second day on Tuesday following last week's plunge tied to fears about an escalation of trade barriers between the world's two biggest economies. \"Despite today\u2019s stock market rebound, 'flight-to-quality' sentiment may still linger given market concerns over trade policies, which could be supportive for demand,\" analysts at Nomura Securities International wrote in a research note. The share of investors who are bullish on longer-dated Treasuries rose to its highest level since last June, a survey from JPMorgan released on Tuesday showed. Moreover, the Conference Board said its gauge of U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly fell to 127.7 in March from a revised 130.0 in February. At 11:01 a.m. (1501 GMT), the yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down 2.2 basis points to 2.819 percent.

Caps on foreign ownerships of futures companies will be scrapped as of 1 January 2020, as part of the gradual opening up of China\u2019s financial sector to foreign players.  China\u2019s futures industry is currently dominated by local players.  A filing to the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) dated Dec. 25 showed that J.P. Morgan Futures Co. had applied to make a change of more than 5% in its shareholding structure, though did not give any further details.  If the U.S. bank is able to increase its stake, it would be the first foreign player to have majority ownership of its China futures business.

UBS UBSG.S became the first foreign bank to reach 51% ownership of its China securities joint venture under the new rules in late 2018.

Weeks of asset price volatility may have pushed some fund managers to postpone rebalancing portfolios where equity allocations have been knocked out of whack by a sharp decline in stocks, the bank said in a note to investors. The S&P 500 fell 20% since the start of the year, marking its worst quarter since 2008.  \u201cWe still expect that US pension funds will eventually rebalance within 1-2 quarters,\u201d wrote strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou.  The bank said its estimate of $400 billion in equity buying by the funds over the next two quarters could prove conservative. U.S. pension funds bought $200 billion in stocks by the first quarter of 2009, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis -- equivalent to $600 billion today, the bank said.  Wild market swings have presented a challenge to asset managers looking to square their portfolios against a benchmark or return to their long-maintained allocation of stocks versus bonds. While the S&P is down about 24% from its February highs, unprecedented support from the Federal Reserve and a $2.2 trillion relief package from U.S. lawmakers helped stocks rally 15.5% since March 23.  At least one fund -- the Los Angeles City Employees\u2019 Retirement System, which oversees some $15 billion -- is allowing its rebalancing to be deferred, according to a report in Pensions & Investments. The fund did not immediately respond turn a request for comment.  Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist with Reynolds Strategy, said in a note this week a rebalancing that leads pensions to sell bonds and buy stocks \u201cmakes no sense for pensions given the capital calls they are facing from credit and related products.\u201d  Some index providers, such as S&P Dow Jones Indices, have delayed their quarterly rebalancing due to the market volatility, potentially complicating the picture for funds that look to track index performance.  Last week\u2019s rally in stocks may have helped boost some funds\u2019 equity allocations, making the need to increase exposure less acute, said Mike Schumacher, head of macro strategy at Wells Fargo Securities.  The bank last week had estimated that U.S. corporate pensions will need to shift about $40 billion from fixed income into equities to maintain allocation targets. Its estimate now stands at $20 billion following last week\u2019s rally, Schumacher said.  At the same time, mutual funds, pensions and other asset managers rebalancing their portfolio may have stoked some of last week\u2019s gains.  Steven DeSanctis, an equity strategist at Jefferies, said moves from fixed income into equities \u201cmost likely\u201d happened last week, adding that \u201cthe rebalancings don\u2019t have to take place on the 31st.\u201d  Jack Janasiewicz, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, said some of the market\u2019s recent gains have come from quarter-end and month-end rebalancing.  \u201cOnce we get through the next couple of days, it\u2019s going to be a little bit more interesting because the question then becomes, \u2018Do we return really back to fundamentals and technicals?\u2019.\u201d","321":"PARIS, Jan 19 (Reuters) - U.S. bank JPMorgan Chase & Co said it plans to buy a building in central Paris to house up to 450 staff in coming years, as it relocates some services from London after Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union.  The expansion is expected to make the French capital where it currently has 260 staff, its second-largest base in Europe behind London, which has 10,000 staff, JPMorgan said.  The bank will initially transfer sales teams, followed by trading staff depending on the timing of Britain\u2019s full withdrawal from the European Union, Kyril Courboin, JPMorgan\u2019s CEO France, told Reuters.  \u201cParis is going to be the second pole for our market activities in Europe,\u201d he said.  \u201cLondon will still be number one because we are only transferring euro activities.\u201d  That reflects a wider trend of banks shifting selected activities to euro-zone cities ahead of Brexit, without calling into question London\u2019s dominance as Europe\u2019s premier financial centre.  An acceleration in the Brexit process, with Britain now due to leave the EU on Jan. 31 and negotiate a new relationship with the bloc during the rest of 2020, had prompted JPMorgan to go ahead with relocation plans, Courboin said.  Political reforms to labour law and the fiscal environment had encouraged it to favour France, he added.  The building purchase was announced on Sunday as part of the \u201cChoose France\u201d drive, an annual investment event created by President Emmanuel Macron to draw business leaders to France en route to the World Economic Forum in Davos each January.

It also underscores the importance of corporate self-reporting and remediation in limiting penalties, and offers compliance lessons on avoiding control lapses that can lead to penalties and bad publicity.  A view of the exterior of the JP Morgan Chase & Co. corporate headquarters in New York City May 20, 2015. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/Files  APPARENT VIOLATIONS OF MULTIPLE SANCTIONS PROGRAMS  The settlement between JPMorgan and Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control{here} involved suspected violations by the bank's J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, NA unit of economic sanctions related to Cuba, Iran, and designated proliferators of weapons of mass destruction.  OFAC said the transactions were net-settlement payments, some of which were attributable to airlines on OFAC\u2019s list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List), blocked under OFAC sanctions, or located in countries subject to the sanctions programs administered by OFAC.  OFAC said JPMorgan voluntarily self-disclosed the apparent violations and said they constituted a \u201cnon-egregious case.\u201d  It said the bank had operated a settlement mechanism that resolved billings among airlines and other participants in the airline industry on behalf of its client, a U.S. entity and with approximately 100 members, and a non-U.S. entity and its over 350 members.  It said that from 2008 to 2012 the bank processed 87 transactions through the U.S. financial system that may have contained interests attributable to a sanctions-targeted party.  OFAC said that before January 2012 the bank lacked a process to independently evaluate the participants of the non-U.S. person entity for OFAC sanctions risk, despite receiving red flag notifications regarding OFAC-sanctioned members on at least three occasions. As a result the bank for a number of years processed net settlement payments that appear to have violated OFAC sanctions programs.  Separately, OFAC cited the parent company for the same subsidiary\u2019s violation of sanctions regulations regarding Syria and suspected foreign narcotics kingpins. OFAC said that from approximately 2007 to October 2013, JPMC processed 85 transactions totaling $46,127 and maintained eight accounts on behalf of six customers who were at the same time identified on the SDN List. It issued a \u201cFinding of Violation,\u201d which did not carry a penalty.  AGGRAVATING FACTORS  OFAC cited as aggravating factors in the net-settlement case:  --JPMorgan appears to have acted with reckless disregard for its sanctions compliance obligations when it failed to screen participants in the net settlement mechanism with JPMorgan\u2019s clients for purposes of OFAC compliance, despite having the necessary information to do so;  --The bank missed red flags and other warning signs on several occasions, including twice in 2011 when its client notified the bank about OFAC sanctioned entities participating in the settlement mechanism;  --The bank was aware that it processed net settlement transactions on behalf of the two member organizations on a weekly basis, and, given the bank\u2019s involvement in reconciling the organizations\u2019 billings against each other, JPMorgan staff members had actual knowledge of the individual members, including OFAC-sanctioned entities, involved in each transaction; and  --JPMorgan activity helped several entities subject to OFAC sanctions and harmed the integrity of a number of OFAC sanctions programs.  As a big, internationally sophisticated bank, JPMorgan should have known better, OFAC indicated.  OFAC also considered as mitigating factors:  --No JPMorgan managers or supervisors appear to have been aware of the conduct or transactions that led to the apparent violations;  --The harm to OFAC sanctions programs was significantly less than the total value of the transactions, because the transactions represented net settlements between numerous parties, of which the sanctioned entities were only a few;  --The bank cooperated with OFAC\u2019s investigation, including by agreeing to suspend the statute of limitations; and  --JPMorgan has taken steps as part of a risk-based sanctions compliance program to prevent future similar violations.  As examples of the remedial efforts, OFAC said that, between February 2012 and the time JPMorgan ended its relationship with its U.S. entity client, the bank screened all net settlement participants to prevent sanctioned entities from utilizing the process; it increased its compliance staff; it implemented new sanctions-screening software; and it incorporated these apparent violations as a case study for training purposes.  In the net-settlement case, the enforcement \u201chighlights the risks associated with a U.S. person failing to take adequate steps to ensure that transactions that it processes are compliant with U.S. economic sanctions laws \u2014 particularly in instances in which a U.S. person has actual knowledge or reason to know, prior to the transaction being effected, of an SDN\u2019s past, present, or future interest in such a transaction,\u201d OFAC said.  FINDING OF VIOLATION  In citing JPMorgan for violating the narcotics kingpin and Syrian sanctions regulations, OFAC said that from 2007 to 2013, JPMorgan had used a vendor screening system that failed to identify six customers as potential matches to the SDN List.  The system\u2019s screening logic capabilities failed to identify customer names with hyphens, initials, or additional middle or last names as potential matches to similar or identical names on the SDN List.  Despite strong similarities between the account holder\u2019s names, addresses, and dates of birth in JPMorgan account documentation and on the SDN List, JPMorgan maintained accounts for or processed transactions on behalf of these six customers.  The bank identified weaknesses in the screening tool\u2019s capabilities as early as September 2010 and implemented a series of enhancements from 2010 to 2012.  In 2013, JPMorgan transitioned to a new screening system. In November 2013, JPMorgan re-screened 188 million clients\u2019 records through the new system, identified the questionable transactions and accounts, and reported the violations to OFAC.  \u201cThis enforcement action highlights the importance of financial institutions remediating known compliance program deficiencies in an expedient manner, and when that is not possible, the importance of implementing compensating controls to mitigate risk until a comprehensive solution can be deployed,\u201d OFAC said.  RECENT SANCTIONS SETTLEMENTS  In other recent sanctions cases:  -- U.S. federal and state authorities informed Standard Chartered Bank that they are preparing to bring criminal charges against two of the bank\u2019s former employees over alleged sanction breaches involving Iran-linked companies, the Financial Times reported on Monday.  The report said prosecutors were also seeking to fine Standard Chartered about $1.5 billion in a probe based on allegations the bank continued to breach such Iran sanctions by processing U.S. dollar transactions -- even after it paid a $667 fine in a 2012 settlement for such violations.  Standard Chartered PLC chief executive Bill Winters told senior staff on Tuesday that the bank is working on an \u201cacceptable resolution\u201d with these authorities. He said most of the transactions in question date to before 2012.  As part of it 2012 deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the U.S. Treasury, the bank said it had stopped working with Iranian and Iranian-connected companies, the FT said. StanChart closed its Tehran office in May 2012, the newspaper said.  The bank was subject to an independent monitor appointed to oversee its effort to improve its sanctions compliance program under its DPA; that agreement has already been extended twice, as the monitor has found supposed remedial efforts inadequate.  -- U.S. authorities last year alleged in civil and criminal charges that Chinese handset maker ZTE illegally shipped telecommunications equipment to Iran and North Korea. ZTE was also charged with obstruction for making false statements to the US. Commerce Department and destroying export records.  ZTE paid $1.19 billion in penalties to settle the 2017 case and promised to fire four senior employees and discipline 35 others by reducing their bonuses or reprimanding them.  In April, the Commerce Department said ZTE had not disciplined the 35 employees. Instead it \u201cpaid full bonuses to employees that had engaged in illegal conduct, and failed to issue letters of reprimand.\u201d  The United States then revoked the business\u2019 export privileges so ZTE was unable to get the parts manufactured in the United States that it needed to make its handsets. That caused the business to end its operations.  In exchange for reinstating U.S. exports, ZTE paid a $1 billion fine, reconstituted its board and accepted a U.S.-appointed compliance department. ZTE also paid an additional $400 million that it would receive back if it honors its promises.  -- In June, OFAC announced a $145,893 settlement agreement with telecommunications firm Ericsson to settle its potential civil liability for an apparent violation of OFAC\u2019s Sudanese sanctions regulations.  The violation involved employees of Ericsson units conspiring together and with employees of a third company to export and reexport a satellite hub from the United States to Sudan and to export and reexport satellite-related services from the United States to Sudan.  OFAC determined that the businesses voluntarily self-disclosed the apparent violation. But it also termed the violation egregious , because the employees conspired specifically to evade a U.S. embargo on Sudan, they ignored repeated warnings from the Ericsson\u2019s compliance department, and at least one employee was a manager.  -- HSBC Holdings Plc in 2012 paid a $1.9 billion settlement for helping Mexican drug cartels launder money and for breaching international sanctions by doing business with Iran.  HSBC agreed to cooperate with the U.S. Justice Department in return for not losing access to some of its most lucrative institutional banking activities in the United States.  The bank was also put under the supervision of an external monitor, Michael Cherkasky, who said in a report early in his monitorship that there had been resistance from senior managers at the investment bank.  HSBC purchased new technology and significantly increased its compliance team worldwide. The deferred prosecution agreement it signed with the Justice Department ended in December 2017, signaling the department\u2019s satisfaction with the bank\u2019s compliance enhancements.  STRONG SANCTIONS COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS DESIRED  The use of sanctions by the United States government has been significant in recent years.  Law firm Gibson Dunn noted in a sanctions update for 2017{here} that former U.S. President Barack Obama's administration had sharply increased its additions to sanctions lists by his last year in office, and President Donald Trump had added nearly 1,000 people, companies and entities during 2017 alone.  The Sectoral Sanctions Identifications List (SSI List) also adds complexity to the sanctions compliance landscape. In July 2014, OFAC created the SSI List under an executive order authorizing sanctions against specific sectors of the Russian economy. The list has endured as a sanctions program that targets discrete areas of another country\u2019s economy, such as its energy, mining, and defense sectors, while allowing transactions in other sectors.  The sheer number of sanctions, their variety, and their constant evolution makes sanctions compliance time-consuming, costly and difficult.  Companies are spending considerably to help the United States achieve national security and foreign policy goals through sanctions. Senior management and directors must make sure the company has an adequate sanctions-compliance program as well as oversight and testing to meet legal and regulatory mandates. The efforts also help avoid bad publicity that can be costly even if penalties from authorities are low.  Executives and board members must also ensure there are adequate resources for the creation of an effective program and they must play a part in monitoring the organization\u2019s risk profile through an appropriate board committee.  Based on the findings of a 2017 survey by AlixPartners, however, it seems many boards are falling short in achieving this goal.  Out of 361 financial institutions that participated in the global anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance survey, 20 percent of the institutions indicated that they \u201cdo not provide AML (anti-money laundering) and sanctions compliance training for their boards of directors or are unaware whether their boards are being briefed on AML and sanctions matters.\u201d  Sanctions screening technology can help compliance professionals by parsing data and creating alerts that streamline the searching functions. The data will pertain to customers, vendors, partners and agents, so the technology must be able to handle growing data feeds and changing search parameters, without getting tripped up by similarities in names of people, places or entities.  An alert should stop the transaction and alert the end user. But this is where human judgment plays the ultimate role, by identifying false positives or even detecting where a deeper examination is warranted to purse other financial crimes.  Controls built around the sanctions technology, such as the settings of the screening software, should be consistent with the risk approach of the business and periodically updated. Building a process to handle each type of alert and match takes time.  The sanctions compliance program also must have a regular top-to-bottom review, at least annually, with results of the testing sent to upper management and the board.  An annual risk assessment must precede this program review, however so the business determines its sanctions risks first and then builds around them.  One challenge for compliance teams is embedding sanctions information into a business\u2019s systems and workflows. Besides technology, trained staff, defined roles, escalation processes and technical scalability are needed to make the sanctions controls truly helpful.  Furthermore, identifying the persons and entities that reside on the U.S. sanctions list is tough enough, but global businesses must also know which parties reside on the sanctions lists of other governments, as they will have to answer to them for transgressions.

Other recommendations in JPMorgan\u2019s report include promoting policies for families to build emergency savings, policies and programs that boost income and liquid assets and address the underlying challenges Black and Latino families face within the labor market.  It also suggests expanding affordable housing for underserved communities, helping people with student loans and additional aid to small businesses.","327":"SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian antitrust investigator who helped bring criminal cartel charges against Citigroup Inc C.N and Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE denied acting with \"impropriety\" when presented with communications between the regulator and informants' lawyers.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  The court testimony from Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) enforcement director Michael Taylor on Monday points to a defense strategy questioning the integrity of an investigation that ended in charges of collusion during a A$2.5 billion ($1.67 billion) share sale in 2015.  In pre-trial hearings, lawyers for the investment banks and their client, retail lender Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) ANZ.AX, have been trying to show witness statements by a third investment bank which worked on the deal, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, were tainted by coordination between JPMorgan's lawyers and the authorities.  JPMorgan and its staff and ex-staff agreed to act as informants with the ACCC in exchange for immunity from prosecution, the court has previously heard.  On Monday, Taylor, the first ACCC employee to testify, was handed a note, and Deutsche lawyer Murugan Thangaraj told the packed courtroom it showed a JPMorgan lawyer notifying the ACCC about a discrepancy between statements from JPMorgan witnesses.  \u201cThat\u2019s what the file note records,\u201d Taylor said.  \u201cThat\u2019s an example of the JPMorgan lawyers attempting to give advice to the ACCC about how to build a case,\u201d said Thangaraj.  \u201cThat\u2019s your proposition,\u201d replied Taylor. \u201cIf there are inconsistencies, I want to bring them out. I want to know.\u201d  The JPMorgan witnesses had seemed to be \u201cfull, frank and truthful\u201d throughout their ACCC interviews, Taylor added.  Taylor said he had taken charge of investigations for 30 years and that in this instance, the interviews demanded \u201cmore governance than I have ever been involved in\u201d.  More than a year and a half since the charges were brought against Citi, Deutsche, ANZ and several of their executives, the matter is yet to go to trial. None of the accused has entered a formal plea, but all have said they will plead not guilty.  The case hinges on allegations the banks colluded to keep hold of ANZ stock to prop up its price. It is being closely watched by investment bankers around the world because it could have implications about the way they are allowed to run share sales.  During a sometimes tense local court hearing, Taylor was presented with another email which Thangaraj said showed him arranging to meet JPMorgan lawyers without obtaining the necessary clearance.  When Taylor said he was unclear of the email\u2019s significance, Thangaraj said, \u201cYou are perfectly clear what this is about.\u201d  \u201cI am absolutely not,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the meeting occurred. I\u2019ve read the email. I honestly don\u2019t know. I would not ever act with impropriety. I would never ever act inappropriately.\u201d  When Taylor said again that he was confused by the significance of the email, Thangaraj told the court, \u201cthat\u2019s rubbish.\u201d  The hearing continues.","328":"FILE PHOTO: A view of the exterior of the JP Morgan Chase & Co. corporate headquarters in New York City May 20, 2015.

JP Morgan made the acknowledgement in its legal response to a lawsuit filed by Nigeria over transactions made by the U.S. bank when Royal Dutch Shell and Eni bought offshore oilfield OPL 245 from Malabu Oil and Gas in 2011.  The $1.3 billion deal has spawned legal cases spanning several countries and involving Nigerian government officials and senior ENI and Shell executives, a number of whom face trial in Italy on corruption charges next month.  Malabu is controlled by Dan Etete, who was Nigeria\u2019s oil minister at the time of the deal and was convicted of money laundering in France in 2007. He could not be reached for comment.  The lawsuit against JP Morgan accuses the bank of negligence over the transfer of funds from a Nigerian government escrow account into which Shell and Eni had deposited money to secure OPL 245. It claims $875 million from the bank.  In its written defense, filed in a British court last week, JP Morgan said Britain\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), now renamed the National Crime Agency, had approved the transfers to Malabu. It denied negligence.  The bank had previously said only that it \u201cconsiders the allegations made in the claim to be unsubstantiated and without merit\u201d.  JP Morgan did not provide a comment on the filing. Lawyers representing Nigeria did not respond to requests for comment.  It was not immediately clear whether JP Morgan\u2019s acknowledgement that it knew of Etete\u2019s links with Malabu will have any impact on the trial starting in Milan in May. Italian prosecutors were not immediately available for comment.  Eni\u2019s chief executive is among those going on trial in Milan on charges of paying bribes to Etete and others, including sums that went to Malabu. Shell and Eni deny wrongdoing in relation to OPL 245.  Shell said in April last year that it \u201calways knew\u201d the Nigerian government would compensate Malabu and that Etete was involved. It had previously told Reuters only that payments went to the Nigerian government.  DENIAL OF NEGLIGENCE  The lawsuit against JP Morgan said that although it received a request from Nigeria\u2019s finance ministry to transfer funds to accounts controlled by Malabu, the bank showed gross negligence by not making further checks before allowing the transaction.  Denying negligence, JP Morgan said in its response that the transfers were authorized by designated government signatories for the Depository Account -- the then finance minister and the African country\u2019s accountant general.  The bank also said it knew Etete was the beneficiary of Malabu by July 2011, one month before it made the transfers, and that by July 14, 2011, it \u201cwas aware of Etete\u2019s conviction\u201d.  \u201cIt is admitted that the order referred to Etete as Malabu\u2019s principal. [...] It is admitted that by 15 July 2011 JPMC (JP Morgan Chase) was aware of Etete and of his association with Malabu,\u201d it said in the court filing.  JP Morgan also denied that it had acted in breach of Nigeria\u2019s constitution or owed the government or state any further due diligence.  \u201cIt is denied that \u2018the utilization of the Depository Account\u2019 was contrary to the constitution... It is denied that JPMC \u2018should have been aware\u2019 that this was (allegedly) the case,\u201d the filing said.","331":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N is close to winning the lead advisory role for Saudi Aramco's initial public offering, a source familiar with the situation said on Sunday.

The disclosure, made in a regular quarterly filing by JPMorgan, comes after the SEC said on July 20 that Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE had agreed to pay nearly $75 million to settle its part of a continuing investigation into mishandling of the securities.  ADRs are U.S. securities that represent foreign shares of a foreign company. They require a corresponding number of foreign shares to be held in custody at a depositary bank. Under certain conditions the SEC allows the \u201cpre-release\u201d of ADRs before the corresponding shares have been deposited.  In the case of Deutsche, the SEC said the bank had improperly provided thousands of pre-released ADRs and failed to prevent securities law violations when the instruments were borrowed or lent.  Failures to properly handle the transactions leave ADRs \u201cripe for potential abuse at the expense of ADR holders,\u201d the SEC said when it settled with Deutsche.  JPMorgan said it has been cooperating with the investigation. A spokesman declined to comment further.","333":"FILE PHOTO: A woman passes by a JPMorgan Chase bank in Times Square in New York City, U.S., March 7, 2019.

Individuals who fraudulently obtained loans under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program had not been acting as JPMorgan employees, the person said.  However, breaking the law was a violation of the bank\u2019s code of conduct and some people were fired as a result of their improper EIDL applications, the person added.  The lender found that some of its own staff had deposited suspicious EIDL funds in their Chase checking accounts, according to the report.  Those cases accounted for a \u201cvery small\u201d percentage of the total suspicious activity uncovered by JPMorgan, the person said.  Reuters reported on Tuesday that the lender was probing employees who may have been involved in the misuse of funds intended for COVID-19 relief, citing an internal memo.

FILE PHOTO: People pass the JP Morgan Chase & Co. Corporate headquarters in the Manhattan borough of New York City, May 20, 2015. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  The unit, in which JPMorgan would own 51 percent, would allow the firm\u2019s corporate and investment banking divisions to seek more Chinese clients on the mainland in an effort to expand and grow their businesses, JPMorgan said in a statement.  The U.S. bank also said it is looking to double its research coverage of China-listed companies across all sectors, and that it has appointed banking veteran Mark Leung as chief executive of its China business.  The application is a step toward JPMorgan\u2019s return to the securities business in China, having sold its 33 percent holding in a similar venture to its local partner in 2016.  JPMorgan did not disclose who would own the remaining 49 percent of the new venture. However, it said it would raise its ownership to 100 percent if eventually permitted.  China in April said it aims to raise foreign ownership limits in securities, fund management and futures firms to 51 percent. The announcement came as the United States and other trading partners complain of unfair limits on competition.  \u201cThese developments are important for China, the U.S. and global commerce, and an encouraging sign for the world\u2019s two largest economies,\u201d JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in the statement.  In the past, Western banks could only own up to 49 percent of Chinese securities joint ventures. The lack of control and limited contribution to revenue have long been a source of frustration.  JPMorgan joins other foreign banks including Nomura Holdings Inc 8604.T and UBS Group AG UBSG.S who have taken steps in China to set up majority-owned securities businesses, which typically provide broking and underwriting services.  So far, only HSBC Holdings PLC HSBA.L has received permission to set up a majority-owned securities joint venture in China, taking advantage of rules that favor Hong Kong-established banks over foreign peers.  JPMorgan also said its asset and wealth management unit is also working on increasing its current Chinese joint venture stake to a majority interest, subject to agreement with its joint venture partner and the relevant authorities.","335":"NEW YORK - JPMorgan Chase & Co is tearing down walls and moving its San Francisco investment bankers onto \u201chot desks,\u201d a space-saving layout that has long been a fixture at tech companies, while redesigning offices in Dallas and other cities.  A view of the exterior of the JP Morgan Chase & Co. corporate headquarters in New York City May 20, 2015. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/Files  Shared workspaces have been relatively slow to catch on at banks, but JPMorgan is following recent renovations by some rivals, which designers tout as cost cutting and productivity boosting. Still, bankers who covet the status and privacy of personal offices are in for big changes.  When JPMorgan renovated two floors at its Mission Street office in San Francisco last month, it replaced many offices with diner-style booths, designated quiet zones and communal tables for the roughly 250 investment bankers and other employees there.  Noah Wintroub, a San Francisco-based vice chairman of investment banking at JPMorgan who focuses on tech and media companies, said he lobbied for the open-desk layout, though it may be a culture shock for some.  \u201cWe have historically been very hierarchical. When you become a managing director you have this kind of office,\u201d Wintroub said.  The bank already set up hot desking for investment bankers in Hong Kong, said David Arena, JPMorgan\u2019s head of global corporate real estate. It was able to cut costs by putting more people on fewer floors.  Arena did not say if U.S. renovations will help JPMorgan shrink its real estate footprint. He noted limits to the approach, saying it is \u201ccounter-productive if too many people are squeezed into one space.\u201d  JPMorgan is also redesigning offices in Phoenix and Columbus, Ohio. It did not say if there were any plans to include hot desks at the bank\u2019s New York main office, which is currently under construction.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc tore down walls in its New York asset management office in 2017, and Morgan Stanley, is redesigning its midtown Manhattan headquarters to move brokers, traders and tech employees closer together, according to media reports.  Multiple users sharing one workstation has been common at tech and consulting companies for more than a decade, and a 2015 study by industry group the International Facility Management Association found a majority of businesses now use hot desking for at least some staff.  But the layout was slower to take hold in banking, where a cultural resistance stems in part from the need to take confidential calls in private, according to the report.  Offices were also status symbols, and sitting at a communal table instead of one\u2019s own glass office is a big shift for investment bankers.  Some will still have offices, including Wintroub, though he said he prefers to sit with others in the open area and use his office as a conference room.","336":"FILE PHOTO: Thyssenkrupp's logo is seen close to the elevator test tower in Rottweil, Germany, September 25, 2017.

The test on Wednesday mirrored the Canadian bank\u2019s $150 million offering on the same day of a one-year floating-rate Yankee certificate of deposit, they said in a statement. The platform was built over more than a year using Quorum, a type of open-source blockchain that JPMorgan has developed inhouse and is in discussions to spin off.  Participants in the experiment included Goldman Sachs Asset Management, the fund management arm of Goldman Sachs Group Inc , Pfizer Inc and Legg Mason Inc\u2019s Western Asset and other investors in the certificate of deposit.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar  For most of last year, Main Street lenders were grappling with the economic fallout of the pandemic, setting aside tens of billions of dollars to cover potential loan defaults by struggling businesses and households.  But speedy vaccine deployments and nearly $2 trillion in stimulus have raised hopes of a recovery from one of the worst downturn in decades, prompting banks to start unwinding some of their massive loan loss reserves.  \u201cYou will have a better economy in the second half [of the year] because we have the vaccine coming, we have fiscal stimulus and people have saved up a lot of money,\u201d JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said.  \u201cThere will be a lot of pent-up demand and, hopefully, optimism because of the fact that we are getting through this mess. By sometime this summer you could have a very healthy economy.\u201d  JPMorgan CFO Jennifer Piepszak said the bank had the ability to repurchase up to $4.5 billion of stock in the first quarter, according to regulatory income-based limits on capital reductions.  The pandemic has also caused a plunge in short and long-term interest rates that hurt interest income, but the Wall Street arms of the biggest banks have benefited from volatility in global financial markets, a rush for stock market listings and emergency corporate fundraising.  JPMorgan\u2019s net income rose 42% to $12.1 billion, or $3.79 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31. Revenue rose 3% to $30.2 billion. During the quarter, it released credit reserves of $2.9 billion, adding 72 cents to its earnings per share.  Excluding the reserves, the bank reported net income of $9.9 billion, or $3.07 per share, which was well ahead of the average Wall Street estimate of $2.62 per share, according to Refinitiv.  About 70% of JPMorgan\u2019s beat came from reserve releases and much of the benefit was already priced into its stock, Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr estimated.  Analysts called the results solid, considering low interest rates and business challenges during the pandemic. \u201cThese were strong results and the economic outlook is improving,\u201d Schorr wrote in a note to clients.  In the latest quarter, JPMorgan\u2019s numbers also received a boost from continued strength in its trading and investment banking units.  Investment banking revenue surged 37% to $2.5 billion, driven by higher advisory fees across all its products. Trading revenue rose 20% to $5.9 billion.  Looking forward, JPMorgan said in a slide presentation to analysts that it expects its non-interest expenses to go up in 2021 to about $68 billion from $65.5 billion, as it makes another $1.5 billion of investments in its business and spends another $900 million on its technology.  The spending plan continues JPMorgan\u2019s practice of using its financial heft as the biggest U.S. bank to expand its business and take market share from other lenders as it fights to hold off non-bank competitors.  NOTE OF CAUTION  Still, JPMorgan chief Dimon warned of \u201csignificant near-term uncertainty\u201d and said the reserve takedown did not represent \u201ccore or recurring profits\u201d, while other top executives warned that comparisons with 2020 will be \u201cchallenging,\u201d due to a record performance from markets during the year.  Shares of JPMorgan, Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co, which had seen a strong rally in the run-up to earnings, were all down in early trading even as they reported better-than-expected profits.  Near-zero Federal Reserve interest rates led to a record reduction in net interest margins in 2020 - the difference between what banks charge for loans and what they pay out to depositors.  JPMorgan\u2019s net interest income fell 7% to $13.4 billion.  Interest metrics are closely watched by investors to show how much central-bank policies are affecting income, and how well banks are managing their balance sheets.  The bank\u2019s other reporting lines held up well during the quarter. Three of JPMorgan\u2019s four operating units reported higher revenue, with the consumer & community banking unit recording an 8% decline.

An artist's rendition shows how JPMorgan's planned headquarters skyscraper might look in the New York City skyline in an undated imaged released by Chicago studio VIZfire, U.S. Lewis Garrison\/VIZfire\/Handout via REUTERS.  \u201cWe\u2019re building that headquarters for 50 years! It is not a short-term decision,\u201d Dimon said during a call with reporters after posting quarterly results.  Slated to open in 2024, for a price tag of as much as $3 billion, the building at 270 Park Avenue is to house about 14,000 employees.  At 1,425 feet, it would be the second-tallest office building in Manhattan behind One World Trade Center, nearly 200 feet higher than the Empire State Building and 225 feet above the nearby Bank of America Tower, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.  An illustration by Lewis Garrison, a 3-D architectural illustrator who likes to make video flyovers of skylines, here envisions JPMorgan's new headquarters towering over Midtown Manhattan, a T-Rex in what might seem like a field of dinosaurs.  But since pandemic lockdowns happened in March, far fewer workers have been going into offices, making it unclear why such a big skyscraper is necessary.  JPMorgan has been showcasing new safety protocol and prodding white-collar employees to return, but New York\u2019s financial centers are nothing like they were before the pandemic. Major thoroughfares are more populated than when virus fears ran high, but the Midtown lunch crowd remains sparse.  The longer it goes on, the less temporary it seems.  Companies will need 10% to 20% less office space in a post-pandemic world, several real-estate brokerages predict. Nearly three-quarters of respondents to a Piper Sandler & Co survey in mid-September said they expect to work from home more often, up from 59% in its June tally.  Only one-in-five JPMorgan employees are going to offices in New York now, Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said. The company does not expect that to change for the foreseeable future.  JPMorgan will have a lasting shift toward working from home, Dimon said, but he doesn\u2019t know how big the change will be. The bank has as many people assigned to other New York buildings as it plans to have in the skyscraper and can adjust if necessary, he said.  \u201cWe have plenty of leeway in how we manage our real estate over time,\u201d Dimon said.  JPMorgan likely will adopt new floor plans that are less dense with larger conference rooms and perhaps more private offices, said Dennis Donovan, principal at Wadley Donovan Gutshaw Consulting. The bank will be able to do that from scratch instead of retrofitting.  It may also be part of Dimon\u2019s legacy, a building to last beyond the time anyone is talking about his expense ratios or return on equity.  \u201cIt really is something that will endure well beyond COVID,\u201d said Jesse Keenan, a real-estate professor at Tulane University.

REUTERS\/Afolabi Sotunde  MILAN (Reuters) - Italian prosecutors asked a Milan Court on Wednesday for documents sourced from U.S. bank JPMorgan to be filed as part of a corruption trial over the acquisition of an oilfield in Nigeria by Eni and Shell. The long-running graft case revolves around the purchase of the Nigerian OPL 245 offshore oil field in 2011 for about $1.3 billion. Prosecutors allege that about $1.1 billion of that was siphoned off to politicians and middlemen. At a public hearing, prosecutors asked the court to accept two emails sent to Italy by UK authorities. The emails originate from a separate London court case launched by the Nigerian government against JPMorgan Chase, claiming over $1.7 billion for its role in the disputed oilfield deal. The first is an email sent by former Nigerian Attorney General Mohammed Adoke Bello to JPMorgan from the email address of a company owned by Aliyu Abubakar - a Nigerian oilman whom prosecutors allege paid $500 million in cash as part of a bribe. In this email, seen by Reuters, Adoke sent the bank copies of the resolution agreement regarding the oilfield acquisition. The prosecutors said they considered it relevant to establish the relationship between Adoke and Abubakar. Adoke was charged last year for allegedly receiving bribes to facilitate the deal, and he pleaded not guilty to all charges. Abubakar\u2019s trial will start in coming weeks in Milan. He denies any wrongdoing. The second email, also seen by Reuters, is between two JPMorgan officials expressing doubts about transferring $1.1 billion to two accounts at Nigerian banks. Milan magistrates said at Wednesday\u2019s hearing they considered the email significant as it shows there were doubts within the bank over the transfer, which a Swiss and a Lebanese lender had previously refused to carry out. The Milan court will decide on Feb. 3 whether to admit the two documents in the case. JPMorgan declined to comment. It is not part of the Milan case. The companies and defendants involved in the Milan case, including Eni\u2019s current CEO Claudio Descalzi, have all denied any wrongdoing. Milan prosecutors have asked for jail sentences for all the defendants and fines for the two oil giants.  On Wednesday lawyers for Eni and Shell asked for the companies to be acquitted. The verdict is expected at the end of March.","350":"(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co is investigating employees who may have been involved in the misuse of federal funds meant to help small businesses and other customers hurt by COVID-19 shutdowns, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.

A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  U.S. lawmakers and independent watchdogs have in recent weeks warned of widespread abuse and fraud in the PPP, a $659 billion program under which banks dished out government-backed funds to small business borrowers hurt by pandemic shutdowns.

The Small Business Administration, which administered the PPP, said in July that JPMorgan was the largest lender to the program by loan value, dishing out 270,000 loans worth nearly $30 billion.  The SBA has also warned of \u201cstrong indicators of widespread potential fraud\u201d in its economic disaster loan program.

On Thursday, he highlighted 11 problems he said are impeding U.S. growth and opportunities.  U.S. schools are failing to prepare students for professional-level jobs, he said, and suggested that more high schools and community colleges provide training programs and internships for specific jobs.  JPMorgan is retraining some staff in its own workforce as it prepares for jobs to be eliminated by advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence, Dimon said.  Dimon also called on the U.S. government to finish implementing the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act, which was passed in 2015 and is meant to provide $305 billion to improve America\u2019s highways through 2020.  Bad mortgage rules are also hindering U.S. economic growth, Dimon said. He called for on policymakers to reduce \u201conerous and unnecessary origination and servicing requirements\u201d and to open up \u201cthe securitization markets for safe loans.\u201d  JPMorgan is reviewing its role in originating, servicing and holding mortgages, given the current lack of reforms, he said.  Last year, Dimon praised U.S. President Donald Trump for the 2017 tax reform law, which lowered the business tax rate. JPMorgan invested in technology and new branches and raised employee salaries in 2018 because the reforms boosted its net income by $3.7 billion, Dimon wrote.  However, Dimon said reform is still needed to address inequities in taxes on individuals, and suggested the government expand the earned income tax credit to help the lowest earners.

A presentation by the U.S. investment bank showed 19 of the 24 emerging economies it follows are likely to lift borrowing rates. Only one country, Malaysia, will keep them on hold, while Nigeria, India, China and Turkey are set to cut their rates.  The list wasn\u2019t exhaustive, and didn\u2019t include the likes of Argentina, for example, which more than doubled its interest rates to an eyewatering 60 percent last year as its currency collapsed.  JP Morgan\u2019s global head of research, Joyce Chang, who made the presentation, said the expected pace of hikes could end up being slower if the U.S. Federal Reserves keeps its own increases to a minimum. However, the trend will still be upwards and shows the turnaround seen in emerging markets over the last 12 months.  Between 2015 and early 2018 developing countries, big and small from Brazil and Russia to Armenia and Zambia slashed interest rates, sending borrowing costs sinking and fund managers\u2019 profits soaring.  From February last year, though, the resurgent dollar and higher U.S. borrowing costs hit currencies hard, particularly Argentina and Turkey\u2019s, prompting EM central banks to raise rates instead.  The result was that hikes outstripped cuts for eight straight months after April - the longest such run since mid 2011.  (GRAPHIC: Shifting gears - tmsnrt.rs\/2MupTVW)  Chang\u2019s presentation showed that the emerging market average rate will go up to just over 5 percent this year, from around 4.7 percent now.  Still JP Morgan expects local currency emerging market bonds to have a much better year than they did last year despite the moves. It sees the asset class earning investors just over 6 percent, which is virtually what they lost last year.

Dimon\u2019s pay package consists of an annual base salary of $1.5 million and performance-based incentive of $30 million, according to the regulatory filing.  The bank also disclosed awards of restricted stock units to other top executives indicating their compensation.  Gordon Smith, co-president and CEO of Consumer & Community Banking, and Daniel Pinto, co-president and CEO of the Corporate & Investment Bank, each received $22.5 million in total compensation, up 2.3% from a year ago.  Mary Erdoes, CEO for Asset & Wealth Management, received $21 million, up 2.4%. Marianne Lake, CEO of consumer lending, received more than $15.3 million, up 2.3%.

Three of the four key portfolio managers, Mark Vanacore and Jon Segal and Jason Hempel, who have been leading the multi-strategy credit business for the last decade, will stay with the fund.  Investors will be allowed to shift their capital to the new fund or pull some or all of it out at a time the fund was delivering gains to investors. Exact returns for 2019 could not be learned.

Dimon, widely regarded as the face of the U.S. banking sector, is the most prominent voice on Wall Street so far to project that the economic cost of the coronavirus will not evaporate quickly, and said the bank\u2019s earnings will be down \u201cmeaningfully in 2020.\u201d  But, Dimon said, even in the worst case scenario, the bank is strong and will continue lending to customers and will not need any relief from the federal government.  JPMorgan\u2019s stock was up 5% to $84.05 in morning trading.  JPMorgan could look at suspending dividends if gross domestic product were to fall by as much as 35% in the second quarter and the unemployment rate were to rise further to 14% in the fourth quarter of the year, the chief executive officer wrote in his annual letter to shareholders.  Questions are mounting about whether big U.S. banks will have to cut dividends later this year as the coronavirus crisis puts a record portion of Americans out of work, making it difficult for borrowers to pay back loans.  \u201cIf the board suspended the dividend, it would be out of extreme prudence and based upon continued uncertainty over what the next few years will bring,\u201d Dimon said.  Jamie Dimon, chairman & CEO of JP Morgan Chase & Co., speaks during the Bloomberg Global Business Forum in New York City, New York, U.S., September 25, 2019. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  Dimon highlighted some challenges seen at the bank\u2019s call centers, where a handful of staff have fallen ill, customer call volumes are at record highs and local restrictions have effectively shuttered some offices.  For customers hurt by the crisis, the bank is offering a 90-day grace period to make mortgage and auto loan payments, removing minimum payment requirements on credit cards, and waiving any late fees for those types of accounts, according to the letter.  Dimon also said that the vast majority of the bank\u2019s 16,850 ATMs were \u201cwell-stocked and still functioning\u201d to provide cash for customers.  RELIEF MEASURES  The bank said it had extended about $950 million in new loans to small businesses over the last 60 days and would still extend credit to small businesses.  \u201cIn both our central case scenario for 2020 results and in our extremely adverse scenario, we are lending \u2013 currently or plan to do so \u2013 an additional $150 billion for our clients\u2019 needs,\u201d Dimon said.  Even with that lending, Dimon wrote JPMorgan currently has over $500 billion in total liquid assets and $300 billion in incremental borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Banks.  Dimon did not pass up the opportunity to suggest regulatory and fiscal policy reform, as he has often done in past annual letters.  \u201cAfter the crisis subsides (and it will), our country should thoroughly review all aspects of our preparedness and response. And we should use the opportunity to closely review the economic response and determine whether any additional regulatory changes are warranted to improve our financial and economic system. There will be a time and place for that \u2013 but not now.\u201d  JPMorgan will also nominate former International Business Machines Corp IBM.N CEO Virginia \"Ginni\" Rometty for election to its board.

JP Morgan made the acknowledgement in its legal response to a lawsuit filed by Nigeria over transactions made by the U.S. bank when Royal Dutch Shell and Eni bought offshore oilfield OPL 245 from Malabu Oil and Gas in 2011.  The $1.3 billion deal has spawned legal cases spanning several countries and involving Nigerian government officials and senior ENI and Shell executives, a number of whom face trial in Italy on corruption charges next month.  Malabu is controlled by Dan Etete, who was Nigeria\u2019s oil minister at the time of the deal and was convicted of money laundering in France in 2007. He could not be reached for comment.  The lawsuit against JP Morgan accuses the bank of negligence over the transfer of funds from a Nigerian government escrow account into which Shell and Eni had deposited money to secure OPL 245. It claims $875 million from the bank.  In its written defence, filed in a British court last week, JP Morgan said Britain\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), now renamed the National Crime Agency, had approved the transfers to Malabu. It denied negligence.  The bank had previously said only that it \u201cconsiders the allegations made in the claim to be unsubstantiated and without merit\u201d.  JP Morgan did not provide a comment on the filing. Lawyers representing Nigeria did not respond to requests for comment.  It was not immediately clear whether JP Morgan\u2019s acknowledgement that it knew of Etete\u2019s links with Malabu will have any impact on the trial starting in Milan in May. Italian prosecutors were not immediately available for comment.  Eni\u2019s chief executive is among those going on trial in Milan on charges of paying bribes to Etete and others, including sums that went to Malabu. Shell and Eni deny wrongdoing in relation to OPL 245.  Shell said in April last year that it \u201calways knew\u201d the Nigerian government would compensate Malabu and that Etete was involved. It had previously told Reuters only that payments went to the Nigerian government.  DENIAL OF NEGLIGENCE  The lawsuit against JP Morgan said that although it received a request from Nigeria\u2019s finance ministry to transfer funds to accounts controlled by Malabu, the bank showed gross negligence by not making further checks before allowing the transaction.  Denying negligence, JP Morgan said in its response that the transfers were authorised by designated government signatories for the Depository Account -- the then finance minister and the African country\u2019s accountant general.  The bank also said it knew Etete was the beneficiary of Malabu by July 2011, one month before it made the transfers, and that by July 14, 2011, it \u201cwas aware of Etete\u2019s conviction\u201d.  \u201cIt is admitted that the order referred to Etete as Malabu\u2019s principal. It is admitted that by 15 July 2011 JPMC (JP Morgan Chase) was aware of Etete and of his association with Malabu,\u201d it said in the court filing.  JP Morgan also denied it should have been aware of Nigeria\u2019s constitutional law or that it owed the government or state any further due diligence.

FILE PHOTO: A sign of JP Morgan Chase Bank is seen in front of their headquarters tower in Manhattan, New York, U.S., November 13, 2017. REUTERS\/Amr Alfiky\/File Photo  The suit filed in the English courts in 2017 relates to the purchase of the offshore OPL 245 oilfield in Nigeria by oil majors Royal Dutch Shell and Eni in 2011, which is the subject of an ongoing trial in Milan.  The six-week London trial will start on the first available date after Nov. 1 next year, meaning that proceedings may not begin until 2022.  JP Morgan declined to comment.  Central to the case is a $1.3 billion payment from Shell and Eni to secure the block that was deposited into a Nigerian government escrow account managed by JP Morgan.  As part of the proceedings, JP Morgan will also have to disclose within 21 days which individuals at the bank made the final decision to transfer the funds in question.  \u201cNigeria is pleased that JP Morgan has agreed it will now confirm all the senior figures at the bank who were involved,\u201d a spokesman for the Nigerian government on this case said.  \u201cThis claim will move forward and Nigeria will hold JP Morgan accountable for its central role in the OPL 245 fraud.\u201d  In the claim, Nigeria alleges JP Morgan was negligent in its decision to transfer the funds in escrow to a company controlled by the country\u2019s former oil minister Dan Etete instead of government coffers.  The damages sought include the monies allegedly sent to Etete, around $875 million paid out in three instalments, plus interest taking the total to $1.7 billion.  The decision is also likely to compel the bank to disclose details of its internal processes. JP Morgan sought to quash the case last year.  The Milan trial began in 2018. In July 2020, Italian prosecutors asked a Milan court for Eni and Shell to be fined and some of their present and former executives, including Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi, to be jailed.  They further requested Eni and Shell to be fined 900,000 euros ($1.06 million) each and sought to confiscate a total of $1.092 billion from all the defendants in the case, the equivalent of the bribes alleged to have been paid.  Shell and Eni and the managers accused in the Milan court case, including Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi, have all denied any wrongdoing.

FILE PHOTO: Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar speaks during the 2019 United Nations Climate Action Summit at U.N. headquarters in New York City, New York, U.S., September 23, 2019.  Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Thursday a withdrawal agreement could be clinched by the end of October, which would allow the United Kingdom to leave the European Union in an orderly fashion.  EU negotiator Michel Barnier and his British counterpart Stephen Barclay, meanwhile, held a \u201cconstructive\u201d meeting on Friday, both the British and EU sides said.  The pound, British stocks, bonds, and Irish government bonds rallied as investors scrambled to cover short positions, with the British currency hitting its highest levels in more than three months. It was trading at $1.2675 at 1500 GMT.  Deutsche Bank said it was no longer negative on the pound.  \u201cThis represents a significant change of tune by the Irish government, that has so far been relatively pessimistic about the prospect of talks moving forward,\u201d Deutsche\u2019s foreign exchange strategist, Oliver Harvey, told clients.  JPMorgan, meanwhile, predicted a deal would be struck, noting the two sides appeared to have found a solution to the thorny Irish border issue.  The bank now sees a 50% chance of a withdrawal agreement being struck with a \u201cmodified\/time-limited\u201d Irish \u201cbackstop\u201d that could get round a major sticking point over customs and border arrangements between Ireland and the UK province of Northern Ireland.  It had previously put the likelihood at just 5%.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Some remain doubtful. For one, time is short and any deal British Prime Minister Boris Johnson brings back from Brussels will need the British parliament\u2019s approval, including from hardline pro-Brexit factions.  The British government is therefore likely to request an extension to the Brexit deadline and then hold a general election, UBS Wealth Management said. But it acknowledged that the chances of a Brexit agreement had nonetheless increased.  \u201cThe chances of a deal seem to have improved and the pound has moved accordingly but hurdles still remain,\u201d said Dean Turner, economist at the wealth manager.  \u201cTime to thrash out the details of the deal are tight, and then there is the question of parliamentary approval.\u201d  A deal would prolong the rally in the pound, Turner said, predicting sterling would hit $1.35 and trade in the \u201clow 80s\u201d against the euro if there was an agreement.  Morgan Stanley upped its chances of a Brexit deal to 55% from 35% before the latest developments. The investment bank said a deal would be negotiable if London agreed to a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, although it was uncertain such an arrangement would be approved by the current parliament.  \u201cWe continue to see elections as the most plausible mechanism to decide the way forward on Brexit and expect them to be held before Brexit,\u201d the bank\u2019s economists Jacob Nell and Brunca Skarica wrote in a note to clients.  \u201cHowever, given that a Johnson government seems to have switched to supporting a negotiable deal, we now see a significantly reduced risk of a no-deal outcome after elections, since even a Johnson government would prefer an orderly exit to a no-deal outcome.\u201d  Goldman Sachs was ahead of the bunch, however, sending a recommendation late last Friday for clients to buy sterling against the dollar, with a target of $1.30 compared with the then spot pound value of around $1.23.  It assessed the probabilities of a Brexit deal being struck at 60%.  Political risk consultancy Eurasia Group raised its probability of a Brexit deal from 5% to 10%.

Until now, banks like JPMorgan have used Britain as a gateway to access clients based across the EU. But a loss of so-called passporting rights from March 29 has forced the bank and several rivals to redistribute assets and capital from London to much smaller operations in other hubs including Paris and Frankfurt.

West Texas Intermediate prices are seen following a similar trajectory with prices averaging $60 per barrel in 2020 and $57.50 in 2021, JP Morgan said.

JPMorgan\u2019s co-head of M&A in EMEA, Guillermo Baygual, will work closely with Lukasz Dziarnowski - a seasoned banker who focuses on clients in Central and Eastern Europe as well as the Middle East and North Africa - to pioneer the SPAC bonanza in Europe and win a slice of lucrative advisory fees, according to the memo.  Based in London, the pair will be involved in all SPAC merger discussions across the EMEA region and play matchmaking between SPAC entrepreneurs and possible targets, the memo said.  \u201cGuillermo and Lukasz should be involved in all SPAC merger discussions we are having across the EMEA region to maximize our collective insight into market activity, identify best practices and deliver top-quality execution,\u201d the memo said.  JPMorgan competes head-to-head with the likes of Deutsche Bank to dominate global SPAC league tables.  SPACs raise money from investors with the aim of finding a private company to buy. If the sponsors fail to complete their desired merger within a certain timeframe, the SPAC is dissolved and the money returned to shareholders.

Both Baygual and Dziarnowski will retain their existing roles, with Baygual also leading JPMorgan\u2019s EMEA investment banking industries coverage for corporate clients.

Under new rules announced in late 2017, foreign asset managers can own up to 51 percent of their Chinese mutual fund joint ventures, though, so far, no company has managed to do so.  J.P. Morgan Asset Management (JPMAM) currently owns 49 percent of China International Fund Management (CIFM), while Shanghai International Trust, belonging to Shanghai Pudong Development Group, owns 51 percent.  Shanghai International Trust said in a posting on the Shanghai United Assets and Equity Exchange website it is auctioning a 2 percent stake.  \u201cThis is a very, very critical step because this potentially could open the doorway for a number of other deals to begin working their way through the process,\u201d said Peter Alexander, founder and managing director of fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors.  Alexander added he had \u201ca high conviction level\u201d that JPMorgan will be the buyer and that the purchase price will be watched closely, as it will offer a guidance on the \u201cpremium\u201d foreign firms need to pay for control of a Chinese fund venture.  The open bidding process begins on May 8, and will continue until June 4.  Last year, JPMorgan said that its asset management unit was \u201cpursuing its desire and intent to increase its current joint venture stake in China International Fund Management Co Ltd to a majority interest.\u201d  A spokeswoman for JPMAM declined to comment on Shanghai International Trust\u2019s move.

A number of foreign asset managers, including JPMAM, wholly own companies in China which hold private securities fund management licenses. However, these licenses do not allow them to sell products to mass market retail investors, something that is allowed for mutual fund management joint ventures.  Lack of access to the China market for foreign companies, including financial services firms, is one major area of contention in the trade dispute between China and the United States, and Z-Ben Advisors\u2019 Alexander said that the stake auction by JPMorgan\u2019s Chinese fund partner could be seen in the context of the trade talks.  \u201cYou know this could have been done ages ago.

Hong Kong\u2019s Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), in 2019, charged Leung with bribing the chairman of a logistics company, by employing his son at the bank\u2019s Hong Kong office in 2010.  She did so, the prosecution told the court last year, in anticipation that Ang Keng-lam, the then chairman of Kerry Logistics Network Ltd, would influence his company to give JPMorgan a role on its up-coming initial public offering (IPO).  However, deputy district judge Emily Cheung told the court, when explaining the reasons for her not guilty verdict, that Leung had not played a major role in the decision to hire Ang\u2019s son, Ang Ren-yi, and that Leung had followed procedures required under JPMorgan\u2019s client referral programme.  That programme allowed staff to refer the children or relatives of the company\u2019s existing and potential clients for training or employment.  Cheung said in a three hour-long explanation of her verdict that it was the responsibility of JPMorgan\u2019s Junior Resources Management team to make checks with the bank\u2019s legal and compliance department when employees were being hired under the scheme.  Ang Ren-yi worked at JPMorgan from June 2010 until October 2011, according to court documents.  Leung, who left the Wall Street bank in 2015 according to her LinkedIn profile, did not comment when approached by Reuters outside the courtroom on Monday. A representative of both Angs\u2019 current employer Metropoly Holdings Ltd said they had no comment.  An ICAC spokeswoman said the Commission \u201crespects the court ruling. We will study the reasons for the verdict in consultation with the Department of Justice.\u201d  JPMorgan declined to comment.

The 10-year yield swung in a 24 basis point trading range last week, according to Reuters data, as global stock markets were roiled by jitters over less stimulus from central banks and technical selling spurred by a surge in volatility. Wall Street suffered its worst week in two years last week with the benchmark S&P 500 index posting a 5.2 percent drop, which was its biggest weekly percentage decline since January 2016. The share of investors who said they were neutral on longer-dated government debt was 51 percent, which was the highest since Oct. 16, JPMorgan said. This compared with 47 percent who said they were neutral the prior week. Meanwhile, the share of investors who said on Monday they were \"long\" longer-dated Treasuries fell to 13 percent from 15 percent the previous week, JPMorgan said. The share of investors who said they were \"short,\" or holding fewer Treasuries than their portfolio benchmarks, decreased to 36 percent from 38 percent.

The largest U.S. bank by assets set the new deadline in a letter sent to the companies in late January, in which it also said they must agree a \u201cconcrete plan\u201d to transition to a new method of collecting customer data, according to two people familiar with the matter.  Otherwise, JPMorgan will block all automated access to the data, including through so-called screenscraping, or the process of collecting data from one application to use it in another, the people said.  A JPMorgan spokesman confirmed the contents of the letter and said the company already has agreements with more than 95 percent of companies that request data access.  The deadline is the latest move in the bank\u2019s effort to transition fintechs and data aggregators to what it has said is a more secure way of accessing customer data.  Fintech startups, such as those that offer budgeting apps or digital wealth management, usually connect to a user\u2019s bank account to gather the necessary data to provide their services. Some gather the data through aggregators such as Visa Inc -owned Plaid or Yodlee, while others request that customers provide their password.  Through JPMorgan\u2019s new method, fintechs will not be able to use customers\u2019 passwords to access their entire financial data, but will instead connect to a set of bank programming code known as an API, that grants access only to limited account information authorized by the consumer.  The transition comes as large banks and fintech companies globally tussle over data-sharing. Banks have said their wariness to grant access to third parties stems from a need to protect highly sensitive information, such as transaction history and income.  Fintechs have been skeptical, arguing that it should be up to consumers, not banks, to decide what companies can look at that information.  JPMorgan said earlier this year that it was preparing to crack down on the use of customer passwords for data-sharing purposes, and had been discussing another method to access information since 2016.  However, some startups said they were surprised by the stringent requirements and strict deadline in the letter, according to one fintech source.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this with aggregators and fintechs since 2016 because our secure API is the best way to help our customers make smart money decisions more easily and safely,\u201d Paul LaRusso, managing director of digital platforms at Chase, said in a written statement to Reuters.  The bank said companies that have agreed to JPM\u2019s terms would be able to continue accessing customer data using existing tools, provided they have a concrete plan in place to move to the new method and are making progress toward that goal.  \u201cCustomers can still use their favorite apps and websites while these companies migrate to our API,\u201d LaRusso said.

JPMorgan told investors in September that Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait \u2013 all members of the Gulf Cooperation Council \u2013 would join its emerging-market government bond indexes this year, in phases starting Jan. 31 and running to Sept. 30.  The indexes are performance benchmarks for emerging-market debt; membership can help a country sell bonds and cut borrowing costs. Fund managers estimated index inclusion will generate $30 billion to $40 billion by September.  \u201cWe estimate roughly $30 billion to 35 billion would be the total inflow by September 2019,\u201d said Parth Kikani, director o fixed income at Emirates NBD Asset Management. \u201cHowever, the majority of that (more than half) would be active money that has already come in.\u201d  More than $15 billion in new money has already been invested in GCC sovereign debt before the index entry, Kikani said.  GCC governments have become some of the biggest debt issuers globally over the past few years, tapping international capital markets to plug budget deficits caused by a slump in oil prices.  They will represent around 11.2 percent of JPMorgan\u2019s EMBI Global Diversified and EMBI Global series, JPMorgan said in September.  Saudi Arabia\u2019s bond spreads rose late last year amid an emerging-market sell-off and oil price volatility; the fallout from the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, in early October, added further pressure.  Option-adjusted spreads of Saudi Arabia\u2019s debt due in 2026 rose 53 basis points since early October until the end of the year. By comparison, spreads on 2026 bonds issued by similarly rated Chile rose 39 bps during the same period.  But since the beginning of the year spreads on Saudi bonds have fallen significantly, in line with Chile. That decline was partly caused by yields tightening across emerging markets and partly by foreign investors returning to snap up a $7.5 billion Saudi bond issue in January.  SPREAD COMPRESSION Fund managers said a rebound in oil prices and rekindled risk appetite as well as a strong bid from investors before the index inclusion all helped GCC spread compression.  Some dedicated index investors will wait for the final inclusion to put their money to work, said Sergey Dergachev, senior portfolio manager at Germany-based Union Investment. However, \u201cexpectations matter\u201d for the large group of EMBI indexed investors, he added.  Countries with liquid debt curves -- Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Qatar -- have benefited the most so far.  Dergachev expects overall regional spreads to continue to move in line with global emerging-market debt. Fluctuations will depend on oil prices and such factors as China\u2019s economic growth, geopolitical issues and interest rates hikes.  But he also expected they will be \u201csomewhat supported still from EMBI inclusion euphoria, so if markets stay in the same mood as they are now, GCC should benefit and be a marginal outperformer versus other regions.\u201d  The minimum size for inclusion in the indexes is $500 million, and during the inclusion, instruments will need to have a maturity date beyond March 2022, JPMorgan said.

FILE PHOTO: A view of the exterior of the JP Morgan Chase & Co. corporate headquarters in New York City May 20, 2015. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/Files  Spending on non-essential goods and services, like retail, restaurants, and entertainment, fell sharply across income brackets accounting for nearly all of the drop in spending during that period, the JP Morgan Chase Institute said.  This is primarily due to the stay-at-home orders put in place by many U.S. states, and less due to job loss, at least for now, said Diana Farrell, president and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase Institute.  \u201cWhile surprising, we expect this may change over time as layoffs, furloughs and unemployment insurance further impact families\u2019 bank accounts,\u201d Farrell said in a statement.  The overall fall in spending was 8 times larger than the average drop in household credit card spending in the first month of unemployment during regular times, according to the report.  The global outbreak of the coronavirus has forced governments worldwide to impose lockdown orders to contain its rapid spread, crippling economic activity.  In the United States, more than 32 million people have filed for unemployment benefits since March while consumer demand has also been hard hit.  The U.S. Federal Reserve warned this week that the country will likely see weak economic growth for \u201can extended period\u201d.  The JPMorgan Chase Institute studied anonymized spending data from more than 8 million Chase credit card customers for the period from March 1 to April 11.  Credit card users who report household incomes of less than $39,000 reduced spending by 38%, while wealthier cardholders, with incomes of more than $92,000, reduced spending by 46%. The group says the difference largely reflects higher average spending by wealthier households.  The report showed essential spending, like on groceries and healthcare, initially spiked by 20% before falling back.  Spending on non-essential things fell by 50% and dropped 70% on restaurants.  The group tracked only spending on Chase credit cards, like its Slate, Sapphire and Ink cards. It did not track spending with cash, debit cards or other bank credit cards.

REUTERS\/Thomas Peter\/File Photo  The Chinese government has been considering the sale of Anbang\u2019s overseas real estate and insurance assets, which include Belgian insurer Fidea, since it took control of the troubled company in February.  JPMorgan won the mandate after Anbang asked banks to pitch for a role in August, the sources said.JPMorgan declined to comment. A Vivat spokesman referred questions to Anbang.  An Anbang spokesman said on Wednesday evening the review of Vivat had not been completed and a final decision would be based on the results of the review. He declined to comment further.  Sources said in July the insurer was looking to offload overseas properties worth about $10 billion to shore up its balance sheet as part of a government-backed rescue.  UBS and China\u2019s CICC have wider roles advising Anbang on its restructuring. Sources said they were not handling Vivat\u2019s sale as Anbang wanted independent advice on its European disposals.  Vivat on Wednesday reported a first-half underlying result of 115 million euros, with a Solvency II ratio of 167 percent and a book value of 3.35 billion euros.  Two Dutch insurers, Aegon AEGN.AS and ASR ASRNL.AS, have said they were aware Vivat was preparing a sale and would consider bidding.  ASR could pay around 1.4 billion euros for Vivat, ABN Amro analyst Cor Kluis said in an email on Wednesday.  Anbang bought Vivat -- the insurance arm of the defunct SNS Reaal, nationalized by the Dutch government in 2013 -- for a nominal 1 euro and a cash injection of 1.35 billion euros.  However, Anbang\u2019s foreign expansion plans suffered a setback in May when former chairman Wu Xiaohui was sentenced to 18 years in prison for fraud and embezzlement. He is appealing the conviction.  In April, the Chinese government gave Anbang a 60.8 billion yuan ($9.67 billion) capital injection and began selling its assets.

The move comes as a number of big banks have publicized their aspirations to have more women executives. In August, Citigroup Inc C.N said it aims to lift its share of women in mid- and senior-level executive positions to 40 percent by 2021 from the current 37 percent.  In March, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N said it was committed to having women account for 50 percent of employees globally \"over time.\"  Goldman does not disclose the current global percentage, but in the United States women make up 22 percent of executives and senior managers and 38 percent of total employees.  Studies by university scholars and by management consultants have shown that the financial performance of firms tends to be better if they have more women in top management. One reason is believed to be the diversity of ideas and perspectives that comes from a more heterogeneous pool of executives.  David Gaddis Ross, a professor at the University of Florida who has studied the issue, said in an interview that the increased attention for women from Wall Street likely reflects competition for a new generation of finance graduates who would rather work for firms that embrace diversity.  JPMorgan's conference was to include talks by the five women who are on the 11-member JPMorgan Operating Committee, and interviews with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Nasdaq Inc NDAQ.O CEO Adena Friedman and Girlboss Media CEO founder Sophia Amoruso.","409":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Big U.S. banks made a pretty penny in trading during the first quarter as the coronavirus pandemic caused wild market swings, analysts said, but those gains will likely be overshadowed by declines in other businesses and a bleak outlook for the rest of the year.

That dark optimism reflects the state of banking today.

(tmsnrt.rs\/2RqR9sT)  Shifting updates about the novel coronavirus and government responses during the first quarter created volatility that allowed trading businesses to perform well, analysts said.  Stock markets plunged and soared day-to-day in a manner not seen in at least a decade, while bond markets reacted to the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s cutting interest rates and pouring trillions of dollars into financial markets to address liquidity issues.  Teams that handle stocks, Treasury bonds and foreign-exchange swaps likely did better than those in corporate credit, where there was severe stress at times, analysts said.  Average daily volumes on Tradeweb Markets Inc TW.O, which operates electronic trading platforms for fixed income and equities, were up 39% in the quarter from a year earlier, the company reported.  But activity began dissipating by late March, and few expect it to return as the year goes on.  \u201cGood temporary news for the big banks is trading was really good in 1Q,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr said in a recent report.  The last time Wall Street banks experienced this kind of dynamic was the first quarter of 2009. Investors were worried that banks were in serious trouble, only to learn that government stimulus programs had created a trading boon, which held up through most of that year. But coronavirus volatility may turn out to be quite different, analysts said.  Banks have dramatically restructured their trading businesses since then, and bursts of trading activity have become much more fleeting, even when they are extreme. \u201cIf we look back to, like, 2Q \u201818 when we had that sharp market correction, it took several quarters in a good economy for that trading activity to come back,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck said in an interview. \u201cWith this economy it\u2019s going to take a little bit longer.\u201d","410":"A view of the exterior of the JP Morgan Chase & Co. corporate headquarters in New York City May 20, 2015.

Investors are looking for signs of a Chinese economic recovery to temper global growth worries, especially after the International Monetary Fund this week downgraded its 2019 world economic outlook for the third time.  China\u2019s trade results, as well as credit data, have helped boost risk appetite and reinforce the stabilization thesis, which should have spill-over effects for the global economy, said Candice Bangsund, a portfolio manager with the global asset allocation team at Fiera Capital in Montreal.  \u201cThe whole China situation really appears to be gaining some ground,\u201d Bangsund said. \u201cWe saw a very impressive rebound in exports; this of course is helping alleviate fears of a hard landing.\u201d  U.S. stocks rallied on JPMorgan and an 11.5% jump in Walt Disney Co shares, which lifted the Dow Industrials by 1% and helped the S&P 500 total return index post a record close.

FILE PHOTO: A Standard Chartered logo at its headquarters is seen through a window with raindrops, in Hong Kong, China August 4, 2016. REUTERS\/Tyrone Siu\/File Photo  Britain-based HSBC Holdings PLC and Standard Chartered PLC fell to 25-year lows, while U.S. banks JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of New York Mellon Corp were down 4.1% and 4.7%, respectively.  These lenders were named in recent articles by BuzzFeed News and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, based on leaked documents, known as the FinCEN Files.  Here are the key takeaways from the reports:  1. What are the FinCEN Files?  The investigative series is named after the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, which receives alerts from banks and other financial firms about transactions that appear to be questionable. Those alerts are called suspicious activity reports, or SARs.  Financial institutions filed SARs for more than $2 trillion worth of transactions between 1999 and 2017, according to the reports.  The leaked files pertained to roughly 2,100 SARs filed with FinCEN between 2011 and 2017, representing less than 0.02% of the more than 12 million SARs during that time.  Among the types of transactions highlighted by the report: funds processed by JPMorgan for potentially corrupt individuals and companies in Venezuela, Ukraine and Malaysia; money from a Ponzi scheme moving through HSBC; and money linked to a Ukrainian billionaire processed by Deutsche Bank AG.  2. Why would a transaction be deemed \u201csuspicious\u201d?  U.S. federal laws require certain financial institutions to file SARs if there are signs of money laundering, insider trading, cyber attacks or various types of fraud. The existence of a report does not confirm wrongdoing, but alerts regulators to possible criminal activity.  Banks, money exchanges, securities brokers, insurance companies, casinos and other financial institutions are required to file SARs within 60 days of detection, according to the Treasury Department.  3. What went wrong?  U.S. agencies tasked with enforcing money-laundering laws rarely took any action after receiving SARs, nor did big banks after filing them, according to the FinCEN Files.  As a result, the millions of suspicious activity reports had little-to-no effect on policing the global financial system, the articles said.  4. What does it mean for banks?  It is not entirely clear what negative consequences, if any, banks highlighted in the FinCen Files stories may face.  Analysts on Monday said the revelations were unlikely to lead to additional regulatory penalties or fines, because the behavior detailed in the articles showed that the system is flawed, but did not make clear that the banks had broken any rules or laws.  It is possible that some banks with dated technology may have to spend more money improving compliance systems, and that politicians who typically criticize the industry will scrutinize the matter further, but there was no immediate sign that was happening yet.  \u201cUnless there are more substantive allegations of fact, we expect that (these articles) will not have lasting impacts on the industry or stock prices,\u201d Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski wrote in a note to clients.","427":"June 15 (Reuters) -  * JPMORGAN TO START BRINGING MORE TRADERS BACK TO OFFICE NEXT WEEK - BLOOMBERG NEWS  * JPMORGAN SAID TO PLAN TO HAVE 50% OF NYC TRADERS BACK TO OFFICE BY MID-JULY - BLOOMBERG NEWS Source text : bloom.bg\/3egZWGU Further company coverage:","428":"April 13 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported a 35 percent surge in quarterly profit on Friday, helped by higher interest rates for loans and lower taxes.

The bank said on Tuesday it does not have a firm timeline for when it will return employees to offices, but that it will follow guidance from government and health authorities and take into consideration concerns over public transportation and school reopenings.  Wall Street banks sent workers home in mid-March to help stem the spread of the virus, but that has proved disruptive for some heavily regulated or technology-intensive functions, such as trading and other compliance roles.  President Donald Trump has pressed states to begin easing restrictions on non-essential businesses amid worries the economic fallout will hurt his re-election chances. Some states, though, are resisting that pressure, with New York City, home to JPMorgan\u2019s headquarters, locked down until May 15.  Health experts have criticized the White House\u2019s push to re-open the economy without widespread virus testing, while the World Health Organization warned on Tuesday that lifting lockdowns must be gradual or populations risk a resurgence in cases.  While JPMorgan\u2019s memo did not specifically address testing, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said earlier this month that companies could get employees back to work faster if the government provided them with tests, including antibody tests.  Congress agreed to provide $25 billion for more nationwide testing on Tuesday as part of a $500 billion coronavirus relief package.

After April 1, all existing cardholders will be charged the higher annual fee when it comes time for their annual renewal.

The bank has also struggled to manage the expense of the Sapphire Reserve card, which annually gives customers hundreds of dollars in travel credit and rewards points for a range of transportation expenses, like airline flights, roadway tolls and subway fares.  More than 40 million U.S. households have a credit card from JPMorgan, which comprises about 19 percent of the market, executives have said.  The bank is gambling that customers will deem the Chase Sapphire Reserve cards, which launched in 2016, valuable enough for its rich rewards and travel perks that they do not mind the $100 price increase.  This week, the bank announced new partnerships with the ride-hailing app Lyft Inc LYFT.O and the food delivery services DoorDash Inc.

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Green bonds are booming. Everyone from JPMorgan to Germany is issuing securities earmarked for environmentally friendly projects. Yet the benefits of the $800 billion market in channelling new money to green causes are less obvious.  Green bonds just mean a company issues securities and earmark proceeds for projects like wind farms. That gives the investor certainty how the money is spent. This year as much as $350 billion of the bonds could be created, the Climate Bonds Initiative reckons. Yet the securities may not always be used for very green ends. Oil and gas group Repsol\u2019s 2017 bond, for example, was used to make refineries more efficient.  The market is getting more vigilant. Dirtier bonds are excluded from indexes, and third-party firms scrutinise how funds are used. The European Commission\u2019s Taxonomy, which says what\u2019s green and what isn\u2019t, will tighten the screw.  However, even the darkest green bonds only serve a narrow purpose: They tell investors a lot about the projects they fund, but not much about the company that issues them. An issuer can allocate funds for renewable projects, but that doesn\u2019t make its overall business any greener. A recent Bank for International Settlements report showed that green bonds issuance does not lead to falling or even comparatively lower carbon emissions by the firms selling them.  Green bonds could become more useful if they stimulated new green investment by giving companies a new, cheaper source of funding. Yet that is unlikely, because the credit risk of green bonds is exactly the same as an issuer\u2019s other bonds. If yields on green bonds fall too much out of whack with similar dirty bonds, investors will arbitrage the difference. While there is sometimes a green premium, or \u201cgreenium\u201d, it is usually tiny.  One solution would be to require issuers to also abide by emission reduction targets. Italian utility Enel has gone a step further; abandoning green bonds in favour of debt with coupons linked to its sustainability goals. Even so-called sustainability-linked bonds like these may just be a stopgap. As more capital pours into funds that focus on environmental, social and governance factors, bond markets will differentiate better between green and dirty companies. Green bonds would then become irrelevant.","439":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Spanish energy giant Repsol SA is seen at a barrel during the opening ceremony of its first gas station in Mexico City, Mexico March 12, 2018.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The charges came from an \u201congoing\u201d investigation into alleged fraudulent trading practices at JPMorgan that generated \u201cmillions of dollars in profit\u201d for the bank and \u201ctens of millions of dollars of losses\u201d for its customers, said Brian Benczkowski, an assistant attorney general.  The three men \u2013 global precious metals desk head Michael Nowak, precious metals trader Gregg F. Smith, and former trader Christopher Jordan, who left JPMorgan in 2009 \u2013 were charged with a racketeering conspiracy and other federal crimes, the Department of Justice said in a statement.  The cases relate to spoofing, which involves placing bids to buy or offers to sell contracts with the intent to cancel them before execution, allowing spoofers to influence prices to their benefit.  There has been a surge in spoofing-related prosecutions in the United States in recent years. Two former JPMorgan metals traders, Christiaan Trunz and John Edmonds, already pled guilty to similar charges as part of the same investigation.  A spokesman for JPMorgan declined to comment. One of the largest gold traders in the world, the bank said in an August regulatory filing it was \u201cresponding to and cooperating with\u201d investigations by various authorities, including the Department of Justice, relating to trading practices in the metals markets.  Nowak\u2019s attorneys, David Meister and Jocelyn Strauber of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, said Nowak \u201chas done nothing wrong\u201d and expect him to be fully exonerated. Smith and Jordan did not respond to requests for comment.  Separately, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Monday it has charged Nowak and Smith for spoofing and manipulating prices in the precious metals futures market.  In a statement and in the indictment, prosecutors described how the trio executed \u201cthousands\u201d of unlawful trading sequences that included \u201clayering\u201d deceptive orders at different prices in rapid succession. Prosecutors also described attempts to influence market prices toward specific price points to trigger or avoid triggering options.  An option is a financial instrument that gives buyers the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at an agreed price and at a fixed time. Its value is tied to the value of the underlying asset.  While previous spoofing prosecutions have led to guilty pleas, in a similar case a former metals trader at the Swiss bank, UBS Group UBSG.S, was acquitted by a jury last year, highlighting the difficulties in making a case that canceling orders is a criminal act given that many market orders go unfilled.  Reuters reported on Sept. 12 that Nowak and Smith had been placed on leave from JPMorgan in connection with the ongoing investigation.  \u201cThis is, in our view, a very strong case, and as strong a case as we\u2019ve seen in this area,\u201d said Benczkowski. \u201cWe believe that there were millions of dollars in profit, at least to the bank, and tens of millions of dollars of losses (to customers)  The case was filed with the U.S. District Court in Chicago, and was unsealed on Monday, the Department of Justice said.","441":"(Adds Aviva Investors, Moelis)  March 9 (Reuters) - The following financial services industry appointments were announced on Friday.

Dimon, who runs the biggest U.S. bank, drew a contrast between Trump\u2019s moves and those of other elected officials who he said had not struck the right balance for the economy between regulation and free commerce.  He praised the Trump administration for insisting that \u201crules around cost-benefit analysis be properly applied\u201d and for trying to give regulators \u201cthe proper authority to use common sense.\u201d  Using nearly half of the 46-page letter to promote his views on public policies, Dimon played to his roles as the public face of Wall Street and the chairman of the Business Roundtable, a CEO lobbying group.  Dimon said new federal tax law and \u201ca more constructive regulatory environment\u201d adopted since the 2016 presidential election give him hope that JPMorgan will be able to invest more of its excess capital to grow the bank and expand into new markets.  He emphasized JPMorgan\u2019s ability in the new climate to earn a return on tangible equity of 17 percent, two points higher than the target before corporate tax cuts were enacted and nearly four points greater than the company delivered in 2017.  Offering bank investors a view of the company stock, Dimon contended that it still made financial sense for JPMorgan to buy back shares \u201ceven at or above two times tangible book value\u201d per share, which was $53.56 at year-end. JPMorgan shares closed at $110.99 on Wednesday.  To show that government regulation needs to be \u201csmart,\u201d Dimon included a reprint of a 1992 newspaper essay by the late liberal U.S. senator and Democratic Party presidential candidate George McGovern, who recounted how he had learned late in life that regulations could crush businesses.  Dimon, 62, has said in the past that he was a Democrat, but in recent years he has avoided siding with a political party. He said in the letter that partisanship causes bad public policy.

Activists, including the As You Sow Foundation, Trillium Asset Management and Boston Trust Walden, said they had received notices that the bank has asked for regulatory permission to skip votes at its spring annual meeting on proposals such as reporting on greenhouse gas emissions tied to its lending.  JPMorgan\u2019s position creates reputational risks at a time when clients and investors want banks to help slow the rate of a global rise in temperature, according to a joint statement from the activists on Wednesday.  \u201cThey\u2019re not walking their talk,\u201d said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, in an interview.  She noted how, in correspondence with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission posted on the agency\u2019s website, JPMorgan argued that her group\u2019s request for an emissions report amounted to an attempt to \u201cmicromanage\u201d the company.  \u201cI was surprised at the depth and breadth of the argument saying there\u2019s no way you can talk to us about anything,\u201d Fugere said.  JPMorgan representatives did not immediately comment.  Top U.S. corporations routinely seek permission to skip controversial shareholder proposals. Activists have also targeted other banks and energy companies with climate proposals this year and hope to get a boost from a recent announcement by top asset manager BlackRock Inc to put more focus on environmental issues.  Indeed, other banks have been more receptive to such proposals, or at least, not tried to block them, said Christina Cobourn Herman, program director at the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, which represents the activists. The group says JPMorgan is the largest financier of the fossil fuel industry among 33 top global banks.  Dimon has expressed support for the Paris Agreement to combat global climate warming, and in August joined the CEOs of more than 180 U.S. companies who signed a \u201cstatement of corporate purpose,\u201d arguing that corporate America should focus on social responsibility, including protecting the environment.

The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The platform helps visualize data and can be used traders to figure out which clients are more likely to be interested in a given deal. It can also be used by bank bosses to determine which trading desk or trader has been performing better.  The investment comes as financial institutions look to adopt more technology that can help them take advantage of the vast amounts of data they store.

June 12 (IFR) - The pick-up in European corporate defaults continues to weigh on bank trading desks this quarter, with JP Morgan and HSBC on the hook for sizeable losses after French holding company Rallye entered bankruptcy protection last month.  JP Morgan lost around US$25m on bonds and credit default swap positions related to Rallye, according to people familiar with the matter. HSBC lost about US$5m on its exposure to Rallye, one of those people said. Spokespeople for JP Morgan and HSBC declined to comment on the losses.  The struggles at some of the finance industry\u2019s largest bond trading units show how the recent increase in credit market volatility is creating winners and losers among the banks and funds that trade this market.  IFR reported last week that JP Morgan had struggled this quarter in European high-yield trading. JP Morgan\u2019s European high-yield credit trading desk, headed by Bhavit Sawjani, is known for not being averse to taking risk, having made tens of millions of dollars in revenues for the bank last year, according to people familiar with the matter.  Elsewhere, one of Citigroup\u2019s credit traders left its London office last month after racking up about US$10m in paper losses on CDS positions related to UK travel company Thomas Cook.  By contrast, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse have had particularly strong quarters in European high-yield after getting on the right side of some big moves in bonds and derivatives markets.  Rallye, the holding company for French retailer Casino, has been one of the most high-profile companies to run into trouble this year in Europe.  Investors had been scrutinising its finances for some time. Scott Goodwin, co-founder of New York-based hedge fund Diameter Capital Partners, recommended buying CDS protection on Rallye at the Sohn Investment Conference last year. Goodwin said the company was \u201cburning a material amount of cash\u201d and had a large amount of debt maturing in the next year.  But the speed and scale of the slump in Rallye\u2019s debt prices show how difficult it is for traders caught on the wrong side to cover their positions. The upfront cost of buying five-year CDS protection on Rallye leapt from 48 to 73 points overnight after the company entered creditor protection, according to data provider IHS Markit. That means the upfront fee a buyer of default protection would have paid to insure US$1m of Rallye debt rose from US$480,000 to US$730,000.  The Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee, an industry body of banks and investors that rules on whether CDS contracts should pay out protection holders, voted last month that Rallye entering bankruptcy protection had triggered CDS. An auction to determine the size of those CDS payouts is scheduled to be held on June 27.

In an advisory to JPMorgan index clients seen by Reuters, the bank said the \u201cindex watch\u201d designation covered both Venezuelan sovereign bonds and those issued by state-run oil company PDVSA in its widely followed EMBIG Diversified, EMBIG and EMBI+ indexes.  During the review period, JPMorgan will evaluate liquidity and transactional viability, while watching for official communications around secondary market trading in Venezuela debt. When the period ends on June 28, \u201ca more definitive course of action for Venezuela in the index will be determined,\u201d the bank said.  \u201cIt\u2019s a classic case of a potential bonanza for active managers like us and a terrible disaster for passive managers,\u201d said Jan Dehn, head of research at Ashmore Group, a specialist emerging markets investment manager.  \u201cIf JPMorgan\u2019s final decision is to exclude these bonds from their index those passive investors (who track it) will be forced to sell at exactly the wrong time as the direction of travel in Venezuela is quite clear. Once the regime change happens, which is inevitable, you\u2019re going to want to hold these securities as they\u2019re going to double in value.\u201d  The sanctions imposed by the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) have impaired secondary market trading, liquidity and price discovery on Venezuela\u2019s sovereign bonds and on PDVSA\u2019s securities, the notice said.  In January, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration imposed sweeping sanctions on PDVSA intended to prevent Maduro\u2019s government from siphoning funds from the oil company to maintain his grip on power. Washington has also put curbs on trading in the country\u2019s sovereign debt.  JPMorgan said 76% of investors responding to a recent index client survey said their approved counterparties did not offer them the ability to unwind their PDVSA or sovereign bond holdings.  \u201cThese conditions constitute a de-facto market disruption event from the index standpoint,\u201d it said.  Unless market conditions improve by the end of the review period, JPMorgan may begin a reduction of the index\u2019s exposure to Venezuelan bonds.  \u201cA prolonged market disruption may result in the reduction of Venezuela\u2019s index weight to zero in a phased manner,\u201d the advisory said. Any such phase-out could take three to five months, with the process likely ending in late November. But additional restrictions on secondary market activity could trigger an accelerated wind-down.  The status of Venezuelan debt in the JPMorgan indexes has been a central concern for investors since the sanctions were imposed earlier this year.  Currently, 20 bonds from Venezuela - 12 sovereign issues and eight from PDVSA - are in the benchmark EMBIG Diversified index with a total weight of 0.97%. That is down from 1.19% in early February.  Under Maduro\u2019s government, the oil-rich nation has defaulted on most of its $63 billion of debt as it has spiraled into its worst-ever economic crisis, with rampant hyperinflation and a food shortage.  The Venezuelan securities rallied earlier this year after the United States and other major Western powers recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country\u2019s legitimate leader. The OFAC sanctions, however, have effectively brought activity in its bonds to a halt.","462":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co\u2019s private bank managed at least $10 million for Ghislaine Maxwell, the longtime associate of Jeffrey Epstein, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing two people familiar with the matter.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Strong equity and debt markets and swelling corporate cash coffers also helped boost the confidence of chief executives, convincing them that now is as good a time as ever to pursue transformative mergers, dealmakers said.  \"The clarity on tax has unclogged some of the M&A activity that was strategically imperative, but companies were waiting for the right financial timing,\" said Anu Aiyengar, head of North America M&A at JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N.  While the value of M&A deals globally increased 67 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2018, the number of deals dropped by 10 percent to 10,338, preliminary Thomson Reuters data show, reflecting how deals on average are getting bigger.  Among the largest deals clinched this quarter were U.S. health insurer Cigna Corp's $67 billion deal to acquire U.S. pharmacy chain Express Scripts Holding Co ESRX.O and German utility E.ON SE's EONGn.DE $38.5 billion deal to acquire RWE AG's RWEG.DE renewable energy business Innogy SE IGY.DE.  M&A volumes doubled in Europe in the first quarter, while the United States was up 67 percent and Asia was up 11 percent.  \"The better macro-economic environment in Europe has created greater confidence to get things done. Deals that have been in the works for a long time are now coming to fruition and some industries like utilities are being completely reshaped by the latest wave of consolidation,\" said Borja Azpilicueta, head of EMEA Advisory at HSBC Holdings Plc HSBA.L.  In the United States, the stock market rally was thwarted in the first quarter by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s announcements on trade tariffs on Chinese imports. Corporate valuations are still elevated, but market volatility has increased.  \"Companies have become more aggressive in pursuing deals that make strong strategic sense. But valuations remain high and boards have recently become more cautious on large acquisitions, as it is more difficult to convince their investors of the potential for value creation at such price levels,\" said Gilberto Pozzi, co-head of global M&A at Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N.  Regulatory risk has also increased. Trump's dramatic intervention that blocked Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd's AVGO.O $117 billion hostile bid for U.S. chip maker Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O on grounds of national security earlier this month underscored heightened U.S. concerns about losing out to China in the race for new technologies.  \"While every auction used to see at least one Chinese participant, now people are questioning their ability to deliver and are conscious of the political pushback that Chinese bidders could face,\" said Johannes Groeller, a partner at PJT Partners Inc PJT.N.  On the antitrust front there is also some uncertainty. The U.S. Department of Justice has sued to block U.S. telecommunications company AT&T Inc's T.N $85 billion deal to buy media company Time Warner Inc TWX.N over concerns about how the two companies would consolidate their sectors.  \u201cThe antitrust environment for M&A transactions seems favorable today though certain deals, which catch the attention of regulators or politicians for one reason or another, can be problematic,\u201d said Jack Levy, a partner at Centerview Partners Holdings LP.  \u201cOne should resist the temptation to conclude from those specific deals that the antitrust regime has become more difficult,\u201d Levy added.","464":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co has been hit with a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court accusing it of charging surprise fees when it stopped letting customers buy cryptocurrency with credit cards in late January and began treating the purchases as cash advances.

Chase spokeswoman Mary Jane Rogers declined to comment on the lawsuit but said the bank stopped processing credit card purchases of cryptocurrency on Feb. 3 because of the credit risk involved. Customers can use their Chase debit cards to buy cryptocurrency from their checking accounts without incurring cash advance charges, she said.  Several banks in Britain and the United States, including Lloyds Banking Group PlcLLOY.L, Virgin Money VM.L and Citigroup C.N, banned the use of credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies earlier this year after a dramatic fall in the value of bitcoin, the most popular virtual currency.  Bitcoin has fallen in value by more than half from a peak of almost $20,000 in December amid concerns about regulatory crackdown.  The named plaintiff in the lawsuit, Idaho resident Brady Tucker, was hit with $143.30 in fees and $20.61 in surprise interest charges by Chase for five cryptocurrency transactions between Jan. 27 and Feb. 2, his lawsuit said. Hundreds or possibly thousands of other Chase customers were hit with the charges, Tucker said.  Tucker called Chase\u2019s customer service line to dispute the charges but the bank refused to remove them, according to the lawsuit.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/Files  The goal is to aid the expansion of nonprofits that help people become more financially secure and better able to weather financial hardships. The bank has committed more than $800 million in grants, donations and loans to promote urban renewal in cities including Paris, Detroit, Chicago and others, efforts that need financially stable citizens to succeed.  \u201cWe see financial health as a cornerstone of inclusive growth in cities\u201d, Colleen Briggs, head of community innovation at JPMorgan Chase\u2019s corporate responsibility office, said in an interview.  Families who have even a small amount of emergency savings - between $250 and $749, depending on where they live - are less likely to be evicted, miss housing or utility payments or receive government benefits after a health issue or job loss, according to a 2016 report by the Urban Institute.  JPMorgan is initially giving seven grants worth between $300,000 and $1 million to nonprofits operating in Miami, London, San Diego and Boston, including some, like Mission Asset Fund, which the bank has worked with before.  Briggs said the investments aim to help organizations build out technology or complete other steps needed to scale their services in their communities or nationwide.  \u201cThe main theme is really understanding how do we actually improve people\u2019s financial health - moving beyond knowing how to save more to actually saving more,\u201d Briggs said.  Mission Asset Fund provides no-interest loans to help immigrants and small business owners establish credit scores. Starting a few years ago, the bank\u2019s corporate responsibility office provided financial assistance to help MAF expand to 60 cities, and will give it another $1 million as part of this initiative.  Alice Rodriguez, head of community and business development for Chase, said working with nonprofits has contributed to the bank launching low-cost products like a no-overdraft-fee checking account called Chase Secure.  But where those products cannot help low-income customers, the bank can refer them to these nonprofits.  \u201cTo the extent that we can\u2019t help a client with our own services, we are investing in these other nonprofits so that they can continue to provide that counseling at an ever greater scale,\u201d Rodriguez said.","467":"FILE PHOTO: SsangYong logo is seen on the rear of new XLV compact SUV during media day, ahead of the 84th Geneva Motor Show, at the Palexpo Arena in Geneva March 4, 2014.

The largest U.S. bank by assets showed strength across its businesses in the first quarter, driven by what Chief Executive Jamie Dimon described as solid growth in the U.S. economy, moderate inflation and strong consumer and business confidence.  Loans in the consumer banking division rose 4 percent from a year ago. Overall revenue rose 4.7 percent to $29.85 billion.  The bank\u2019s net interest margin, a key measure of loan profitability, edged up only 0.02 percent point from the fourth quarter, a slower pace of improvement than in the two previous quarters.  Investors have been concerned that net interest margins may have peaked for the banks, since the Federal Reserve has signaled it is unlikely to raise short-term rates this year and the spread between short- and longer-term rates has narrowed.  Investors will be listening closely to what bank executives say about changes in their outlooks for interest margins in coming quarters, analyst Brian Kleinhanzl of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods wrote in a note ahead of the results.  There are other warning signs. JPMorgan\u2019s commercial banking segment made a $90 million provision for credit losses in the first quarter primarily because of downgrades in the credit worthiness of what it called \u201cselect\u201d commercial and industrial borrowers.  In the bank\u2019s capital markets business, equity underwriting fell 13 percent and bond trading revenues fell 8 percent from the year ago quarter.

Unless Prime Minister Theresa May can get a Brexit deal approved by the British parliament, then she will have to decide whether to delay Brexit or thrust the world\u2019s fifth largest economy into chaos by leaving without a deal.  Goldman Sachs said it sees a 50 percent probability of May getting a Brexit divorce deal ratified, adding that lawmakers would ultimately block a no-deal exit if needed.  Goldman said it saw the probability of a no-deal exit at 15 percent and the probability of no Brexit at around 35 percent.  \u201cThere does exist a majority in the House of Commons willing to avoid a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit (if called upon to do so), but there does not yet exist a majority in the House of Commons willing to support a second referendum (at least at this stage),\u201d Goldman said in a note to clients on Friday.  \u201cThe prime minister will repeatedly try to defer the definitive parliamentary vote on her negotiated Brexit deal, and the intensification of tail risks will continue to play a role in incentivising the eventual ratification of that deal.\u201d  May suffered a defeat on her Brexit strategy on Thursday that undermined her pledge to EU leaders to get her divorce deal approved if they grant her concessions.  She has promised that if parliament has not approved a deal by Feb. 26, she will make a statement updating lawmakers on her progress on that day and lawmakers will have an opportunity on Feb. 27 to debate and vote on the way forward.  JPMorgan said that it thought May would now seek an extension to the March 29 deadline.  BREXIT MAZE  The divergent views from two of the most powerful Wall Street banks indicates just how hard investors are finding it to read the labyrinthine plots and counterplots of Brexit, the United Kingdom\u2019s most significant political and economic move since World War Two.  \u201cHaving chosen to afford the PM extra time this week, our expectation is that a majority of MPs will finally be prepared to begin to take action to attempt to ensure that a \u201cno deal\u201d exit does not occur at that point,\u201d JPMorgan said.  \u201cWe continue to think it likely that, rather than allowing the vote and consequent ministerial resignations to occur, PM May will attempt to forestall by stating that she will seek an extension herself.\u201d  Most major banks got the 2016 referendum wrong.  The consensus then was that the United Kingdom would not vote to leave but as results came in showing that it had, sterling had its biggest one-day fall since the era of free-floating exchange rates was introduced in the early 1970s.  In private, though, many bankers are still deeply worried about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.  \u201cThe more messy this gets the more worried I am that we are heading for no deal,\u201d said an executive at one investment bank in London who spoke on condition of anonymity.  \u201cWe still expect a last-minute deal, but the closer we get to exit day we become less sure,\u201d the banker said.  Berenberg, one of Europe\u2019s oldest banks, said it saw the chances of May getting a majority for her deal at just 10 percent. It sees a 30 percent chance of a hard Brexit and a 20 percent chance of no Brexit.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Aramco aims to buy such a stake, possibly taking the entire 70 percent holding owned by Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, two of the sources familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier on Monday.  Late last week, Aramco IPO-ARMO.SE confirmed a Reuters report that it was working on the possible purchase of a \"strategic stake\" in Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) 2010.SE from the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia's top sovereign wealth fund.  Aramco wants to develop its downstream business as the government prepares to sell up to 5 percent of the company, which is the world\u2019s largest oil producer. Boosting its petrochemicals portfolio further could help to attract investors for the initial public offering.  JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley had already been among the advisers assisting Aramco on its IPO.  Aramco\u2019s initial thinking is to buy the full stake owned by the PIF, but if that fails to materialise Aramco could end up with a stake in SABIC of more than 50 percent, making it a majority owner, two of the sources said.  No final decision has been made on the size of the stake as discussions are at a very early stage, they added.  Aramco, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.

Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake stands for a portrait at the headquarters of JP Morgan Chase & Co in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S., September 13, 2018. REUTERS\/Caitlin Ochs  Yet Lake has emerged as a front-runner to replace Dimon when he eventually retires, Reuters interviews with more than a dozen current and former executives show.  Over her nearly six years as JPMorgan\u2019s chief financial officer Lake, 49, has taken on more and more responsibilities effectively becoming Dimon\u2019s understudy. She helps develop strategies for each of the bank\u2019s business units and oversees matters ranging from its annual stress test to employee cafeterias.  Largely unknown outside JPMorgan when named CFO in 2012, Lake has worked in both the wholesale and retail businesses during 19 years there. \u201cShe has been all over,\u201d Dimon, 62, said in an interview, describing Lake as an \u201cextraordinarily talented executive.\u201d  \u201cShe has all of the qualities of a great leader,\u201d he said. Those include being demanding, drawing information out of people and recognizing talent within the 15,000 people she oversees. Dimon said she also challenges him when she believes he is wrong.  Lake, who also spoke to Reuters, said she wanted to broaden her skillset in her next job and has made her ambitions clear to the board chaired by Dimon. She declined to predict whether she will be the next CEO.  \u201cI want to be at this company 10 years from now and I will be quite open-minded about what the next step could look like,\u201d she said. \u201cI have told the board that I want to be here for the long-term.\u201d  Dimon has been CEO for nearly 13 years, the longest tenure among major U.S. banks. He is a larger-than-life figure who steered JPMorgan through the financial crisis and regularly stands up to regulators and politicians. The question of who could succeed him has captivated Wall Street for years. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/2NbTiZo)  Lake\u2019s standing has risen as other CEO candidates have left JPMorgan after growing impatient or getting on Dimon\u2019s wrong side, executives said. \u201cI would put my money on her above anybody else,\u201d said one longtime JPMorgan executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity.  \u201cShe knows the bank extremely well, with her role spanning all of our businesses and functions,\u201d said Gordon Smith, co-president of the company and chief executive of JPMorgan\u2019s consumer bank.  Dimon, who has said he will step down in about five years, would not discuss Lake\u2019s chances. It is the board\u2019s choice, and there are other people who could also run the company, he said. And, Dimon cautioned, \u201cThings change...Everybody changes.\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  JPMorgan has said it has a succession plan and that it strives to give executives experience in its different businesses, but it does not publicly disclose the details.  Two people analysts often mention as possible successors if Dimon were to suddenly leave are Smith, 60, and the other co-president Daniel Pinto, 55, who runs the investment bank. Mary Erdoes, 51, chief of asset and wealth management, and Doug Petno, 53, chief of the commercial bank, have also been cited over the years.  CRUCIAL ADVICE  When former CFO Douglas Braunstein stepped down in 2012 in the wake of the \u201cLondon whale\u201d scandal in which a JPMorgan trader lost more than $6 billion, Lake was one of several executives interviewing for the CFO job. In the interview, Lake credited a colleague for a piece of advice she says helped her win the promotion: Tell Dimon how much you want the job and tell him how hard you will work for him.  \u201cIf you don\u2019t tell people you really want a job, then you have no shot,\u201d said Lake.  Born in Maryland and raised by working-class parents in southern England, Lake joined JPMorgan\u2019s London office as chief financial officer for credit trading at age 30, after working on the JPMorgan account for PricewaterhouseCoopers accounting firm. She moved to the United States in 2004 as JPMorgan was merging with Bank One, which Dimon ran before becoming CEO of the combined organization.  She worked on an expensive, multi-year drive to combine JPMorgan\u2019s data and accounting systems and the implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley accounting controls. She was controller of the investment bank during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and ran finances for the retail bank as the mortgage business went through drastic changes afterward.  Dimon named her to the current post in November 2012 and colleagues were stunned by her intensity in preparing for her first quarterly results presentation in January.  \u201cShe always wants to understand the why behind the things she would say,\u201d recalled Sarah Youngwood, then head of investor relations. \u201cIt is still happening to this day.\u201d  Lake talks too fast for some people to keep up. \u201cThat is because she thinks so fast, but she has slowed it down,\u201d said Youngwood, who now has Lake\u2019s old job of CFO for the consumer bank.  Lake said she sometimes counts to herself to reduce the pace.  Bank analysts say they welcome all of the information Lake packs into her presentations and they like that she is quick to thoroughly address questions on investor minds.  For example, after Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden published a report in January 2015 asking whether JPMorgan should break itself up because of new regulations, Lake made a case that the bank would thrive because of its size.  \u201cShe is probably one of the most gifted CFOs around,\u201d Ramsden said. \u201cShe is really at the top of every dynamic at JPMorgan.\u201d  Lake\u2019s speed, demands for information, and visual memory of numbers can intimidate new hires, people who work with her said. Dimon said he and Lake sometimes challenge one another to remember numbers down to one decimal point. \u201cWe have a lot of fun with each other,\u201d he said.  Lake had her three children through a surrogate starting at the age of 42 after she decided that, even without a partner, she wanted to be a parent. She said she realized after she became CFO that her story could inspire other career-driven women at the bank and she tells it frequently. One junior colleague described Lake\u2019s parenting decision as \u201cfearless.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s too easy to say it\u2019s not convenient right now\u201d to have a child, said Lake. \u201cOn big life-changing decisions like that, you just have to go for it.\u201d  In a nod to her expanding role, JPMorgan put Lake at center stage at its four-hour investor conference this year. Typically, all the business heads would give their own presentations, but this time, Lake spoke for an hour and a half, explaining strategies for each of JPMorgan\u2019s four segments and giving an overview of how the bank is using technology to cut costs and generate more revenue.  Lake says she is ready to take on a different role at JPMorgan and that the next CEO\u2019s main challenge will be making sure JPMorgan remains the country\u2019s most profitable big bank.  \u201cWhen you are a successful company,\u201d she said, \u201cyou have to fight really hard to make sure you avoid complacency, arrogance, bureaucracy.\u201d","494":"NEW YORK, Dec 8 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co\u2019s expenses in 2021 will likely top $67 billion, slightly higher than analysts\u2019 estimates, CEO Jamie Dimon said on Tuesday at an investor conference.

JPMorgan executives had complained that capital requirements prevented the bank from financing such loans itself, but regulators have since eased up, Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said.  As a result, JPMorgan has decided it can hold less cash for its resolution plan, and instead factor in the possibility that it would use the Fed\u2019s emergency lending facility, known as the discount window.  \u201cWe think that this is an important step for us to take to help break the stigma here, and it\u2019s also consistent with the public comments from the Fed,\u201d she told attendees of JPMorgan\u2019s investor day in New York.

The bank reported credit card, merchant services and auto revenue surged $6.3 billion or 9%, with credit card loans up 8%.  But revenues were under pressure this quarter from lower deposit margins because low interest rates meant that the bank earned less on deposits it loaned out. Home lending revenue was also down 5% to $1.3 billion.  Total loans, excluding home lending, rose 3% in the quarter. Home loans were down 17%.  Deposits flowed into the consumer bank in the fourth quarter, helping to offset a decline in loans, as Chase opened around 100 new bank branches 2019 in many new cities where it previously had not been located. Deposits grew 5% compared to a year ago.  CEO Jamie Dimon said the U.S. consumer continued to be in a strong position. \u201cTheir wages are up, their assets are up, their investments are up, their home values are up,\u201d he said on a call with reporters.

The Chinese government has been considering the sale of Anbang\u2019s overseas real estate and insurance assets, which include Belgian insurer Fidea, since it took control of the troubled company in February.  JPMorgan won the mandate after Anbang asked banks to pitch for a role in August, the sources said.  JPMorgan declined to comment. A Vivat spokesman referred questions to Anbang.  Anbang could not immediately be reached for a response. A spokesman told Reuters in August it was reviewing the fate of its overseas holdings.  UBS and China\u2019s CICC have wider roles advising Anbang on its restructuring. Sources said they were not handling Vivat\u2019s sale as Anbang wanted independent advice on its European disposals.  Vivat on Wednesday reported a first-half underlying result of 115 million euros, with a Solvency II ratio of 167 percent and a book value of 3.35 billion euros.  Two Dutch insurers, Aegon and ASR, have said they were aware Vivat was preparing a sale and would consider bidding.  ASR could pay around 1.4 billion euros for Vivat, ABN Amro analyst Cor Kluis said in an email on Wednesday.  Anbang bought Vivat -- the insurance arm of the defunct SNS Reaal, nationalized by the Dutch government in 2013 -- for a nominal 1 euro and a cash injection of 1.35 billion euros.  But Anbang\u2019s plans for foreign expansion have evaporated, and former chairman Wu Xiaohui was sentenced to 18 years in prison in May for charges including fraud.  Beijing gave Anbang itself a 60.8 billion yuan ($9.67 billion) capital injection and began selling its assets.  The two sources said that Dutch insurers Aegon and ASR were considered the most likely buyers for Vivat as a \u201cdeal of synergies\u201d made more sense than a buyout.  The Dutch central bank supports consolidation of the Dutch insurance industry, and last year quickly approved a takeover of Delta Lloyd by NN Group.  Vivat\u2019s operations include personal life insurer Reaal, corporate life and pension insurer Zwitserleven and investment arm Actiam, with more than 54 billion euros of assets under management.

During the 13 years that Dimon has run the bank, he has made it a practice to move even top executives into different roles to give them more experience across the banking franchise.  The new role will give Lake, who has been indicated as a likely successor to Dimon, her first opportunity to run one of the bank\u2019s business, a key qualification that was missing from her resume.

A former JPMorgan banker gave the timeline as the first witness to testify in a legal battle that is being closely watched by investment bankers around the world because it may change the way they are permitted to conduct capital raising.  JPMorgan, Citigroup Inc and Deutsche Bank AG worked on a A$2.5 billion ($1.70 billion) stock issue for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) in August 2015.  All but JPMorgan were charged last year with withholding details of the sale process to investors. Prosecutors accuse the three banks of forming a cartel to restrict the supply of ANZ shares and maintain their price after the banks were unable to sell them all to regular investors, court documents showed.  JPMorgan was given immunity on condition that it cooperate with authorities, the court previously heard.  The defendants\u2019 lawyers want to question prosecution witnesses to determine how and when they came to give signed statements, and who was involved.  \u201cI received a call from my boss in Hong Kong, Nicholas Johnson, telling me to be (available) in mid-March 2016,\u201d JPMorgan\u2019s former head of equity capital markets, Richard Galvin, told a packed court room in Sydney on Thursday.  At a meeting a few days later with company lawyers in Sydney, \u201cthey mentioned there was a matter that had come up around the ANZ capital raising,\u201d Galvin said.  In June 2016, Galvin said he received a \u201cletter of comfort\u201d from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), assuring him immunity if he co-operated with their investigation into the capital raising.  The next month, he met ACCC investigators during which they began to draft a statement about his recollection of the raising, Galvin told the court.  Two years later, in June 2018, the ACCC brought criminal charges against Citi, Deutsche and ANZ.  The banks and their executives have yet to enter formal pleas but have said they will defend the case.  ANZ, Citi, Deutsche and JPMorgan have declined to comment on the matter outside of court hearings.  The pre-trial hearing continued on Thursday.

REUTERS\/Ahmed Jadallah\/File Photo  Oil prices have plunged more than 40% this year after an unprecedented collapse in demand, prompting oil and gas companies to announce spending cuts that will total $625 billion by the end of the decade, according to the Wall Street bank.  The investment crunch will lead to a loss of output that is set to push benchmark Brent oil prices to $60 a barrel within two years, J.P. Morgan analyst Christyan Malek told Reuters.  (GRAPHIC - JPM oil supply and demand: )  Brent LCOc1 fell as low as $16 a barrel in April as the pandemic forced economies around the world to lock down and it is currently trading near $40 a barrel. [O\/R]  The U.S. bank expects global oil demand to average 91 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2020, 9 million lower than earlier estimates, with consumption only recovering to pre-pandemic levels of 100 million bpd in November 2021.  But changes in consumption patterns will lead to a permanent demand loss of 3 million bpd this decade compared with previous forecasts, J.P. Morgan forecasts.  Oil supply, meanwhile, is set to fall by 5 million bpd due to a lack of investment in new output and the closure of some fields. With the lowest production costs and biggest capacity, Saudi Arabia is best placed to take up the slack, the bank said.  \u201cSaudi Arabia will come out on top in the fight for market share as non-OPEC and U.S. production fades,\u201d Malek said.  U.S. shale oil production, which grew sharply throughout the 2010s, will barely rise this decade, climbing only to 11 million bpd by 2030 from 10.9 million this year, the bank forecast.  Before the slide in oil prices, shale output was expected to reach 17 million bpd by the end of this decade.  As a result, J.P. Morgan expects members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting countries (OPEC) to fill the supply gap, once oil prices reach $60 a barrel, which is the price OPEC countries need on average to balance their budgets.  While OPEC\u2019s market share fell from a peak of 39% of total oil supply in 2016 to 33% in 2020-21, the bank expects the group to regain a market share of about 40% by 2025.  Saudi Arabia\u2019s market share is set to grow from 11.6% in 2020 to 15% over the period, a level not seen since the 1980s, Malek said.","512":"(Adds background)  Feb 5 (Reuters) - U.S. authorities that accused six JPMorgan Chase & Co employees of rigging precious-metals futures are building a criminal case against the bank itself, Bloomberg Law reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

As part of the You Invest offering the bank also plans to launch online managed portfolios early next year, the spokeswoman said.

In April 2017 Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in his annual letter that an \u201cinexpensive\u201d self-directed online tool was coming by the end of that year. He also has talked adding free services as part of a bigger consumer package, much like he has seen Amazon.com do with its Prime service.

A JP Morgan spokesman for the region declined to comment.  The Turkish lira tumbled more than 4 per cent against the U.S. dollar on Friday, its biggest one-day fall since a currency crisis took hold in August, raising concerns that Turks are buying more foreign cash as ties with Washington deteriorate.

The ambitious efforts of Facebook Inc to establish a global digital currency have suffered severe setbacks in recent weeks, after several high profile partners including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and eBay abandoned the project.  The exodus followed a pushback from policymakers and regulators in the United States and Europe over concerns Libra could upend the global financial system, threaten users\u2019 privacy and facilitate money laundering.  David Marcus, a Facebook executive who has been leading the project, said this week he expected to get 100 banks and financial firms on board once the project has addressed regulatory concerns..  Speaking to reporters Thursday night, Marcus said Libra did not need banks or payment firms to launch the system, however. He added that Libra intended to meet the highest possible regulatory standards, if not exceed them.

The appointment of a non-Chinese person as CEO of the Hong Kong stock exchange operator surprised the market, and Aguzin will have to balance the wishes of authorities in Beijing, international institutions, and Hong Kong local brokers and traders.  Aguzin, an Argentine, takes over HKEX at a time when shares of the company are near record highs boosted by high trading volumes, particularly through the stock connect schemes which link the Hong Kong bourse with mainland markets.  He will replace Charles Li, another former JPMorgan banker, who announced his resignation as CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) in May.  Aguzin, whose appointment is subject to approval from markets watchdog the Securities and Futures Commission, has been appointed for three years, starting May 24, HKEX said in a regulatory filing.  \u201cI\u2019m surprised the CEO wasn\u2019t more Chinese affiliated,\u201d said Ashley Pittard, head of global equities at asset manager Pendal an HKEX shareholder  \u201cThe future for the Hong Kong exchange is to tie up with mainland exchanges as a gateway to China\u2019s financial hub so this is an interesting decision.\u201d  Aguzin is the first non mainland or Hong Kong-Chinese to be permanent CEO of HKEX since its formation in 2000 in a merger of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong with other local financial market infrastructure providers.  \u201cOur policy with the mainland will not change,\u201d HKEX chairman Laura Cha told the media.  \u201cCurrently we have a good core team of people who deal with mainland related matters ... So the fact that Mr Aguzin does not speak Chinese will not be a factor that will affect our policy or our relationship with our counterparts.\u201d  Hong Kong was the second most popular listing venue in the world in 2020 with deals worth $31.2 billion, compared to Nasdaq\u2019s $51.3 billion, based on Refinitiv data.  The exchange has benefited from a series of Chinese companies looking to raise capital in the Asian financial hub via primary floats, including Kuaishou\u2019s $5.4 billion IPO this month , as well as secondary-listings from U.S.-listed Chinese companies such as tech firm JD.com.  Citi analyst Tian Yafei said Aguzin\u2019s international and investment banking experience could mean HKEX would attempt acquisitions to strengthen areas such as fixed income and currencies and data to diversify revenues away from cash trading.  Aguzin\u2019s appointment comes against the backdrop of Beijing\u2019s imposition of national security legislation on the city that has clouded its outlook as a leading financial center.  Aguzin was appointed as the CEO of JPMorgan\u2019s international private bank in January 2019.  He joined the Wall Street bank in 1990 in Argentina, and was based in Hong Kong as the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Asia Pacific from 2012 to February 2020.  Martin Marron, the chief current chief executive of JPMorgan\u2019s Latin American private bank and head of its Latin America and Canadian operations will replace Aguzin, an internal memo seen by Reuters said.  \u201c(Aguzin) is an outstanding leader and human being ... While we\u2019re disappointed he is leaving us, we thank him for his many accomplishments at our company and wish him all the best,\u201d Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, said.","525":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N has revamped its entry-level program for technologists to attract more young software engineers amid a battle for top talent between Wall Street and Silicon Valley.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  The bank has adapted the two-year curriculum to focus on technical skills and will provide recruits hands-on experience on more challenging projects, Lori Beer, JPMorgan\u2019s global chief information officer, told Reuters on Thursday.  The new hires will also be given technical assessments and training and will be assigned to managers who act as career advisers, she added.  \u201cWe wanted to take a fresh look not only at how other financial services firms think about talent but also, other high tech companies,\u201d Beer said. \u201cWe have fantastic talent but we need a lot of it.\u201d  JPMorgan, which is the largest U.S. bank by assets, brings in about 1,000 entry-level engineers each year globally. Cyber security, cloud technology and data science engineers, are especially in demand, according to Beer.  Similar to other large banks, the company has been facing intensifying competition for the best software developers and engineers from large technology firms and hedge funds which are seen as having better perks and work hours.  The bank now refers to staff under the program as software engineers rather than technology analysts, bringing the terminology in line with that used by big tech companies.  Goldman Sachs Group GS.N, which also calls its technology employees engineers, last year relaxed its dress code for their division in a bid to boost appeal.  At JPMorgan, the dress code was relaxed two years ago, and some offices for tech staff include foosball tables, scooters, video games and guitars, features largely associated with tech firms.  While the growing use of digital technologies has led to a spike in demand for developers across industries, banks have traditionally been big tech recruiters and spenders.  JPMorgan employs 50,000 technologists globally, about two-thirds of them software engineers, up from 40,000 in 2016. It is set to spend $10.8 billion on technology this year, compared to a $9 billion tech budget in 2016.  The bank has 48 million active digital customers, up 14 percent from 2016 and processes $5 trillion in payments a day.","526":"April 2 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has returned to lead the largest U.S bank, after recovering from recent heart surgery, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.

The guilty plea and resignation of Christian Trunz, 34, of London, were announced by the U.S. Department of Justice.  Trunz admitted in the federal court in Brooklyn, New York, to having from July 2007 to August 2016 at JPMorgan and another bank placed thousands of orders for gold, platinum and palladium futures contracts that he never intended to complete.  While the Justice Department did not identify the banks by name in court papers, Trunz had worked for JPMorgan since at least 2008, according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\u2019s BrokerCheck database.  Lawyers for Trunz did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for JPMorgan declined to comment.  Trunz\u2019s plea followed a guilty plea to spoofing last October by another JPMorgan trader, John Edmonds, in a Connecticut federal court.  The Justice Department said Trunz, who worked in New York, London and Singapore, learned about spoofing from more senior traders and engaged in the practice with the consent of his immediate supervisors.  U.S. prosecutors have charged several other traders with spoofing, and their probe into the practice is continuing. JPMorgan said in a Feb. 26 regulatory filing that it was cooperating with the probe.  Trunz pleaded guilty to one count of spoofing and one count of conspiracy to engage in spoofing. His sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 19, 2020. Edmonds has yet to be sentenced.

FILE PHOTO: A Wall Street sign is seen outside the New York Stock Exchange, September 30, 2008. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  Although current President Donald Trump said he would fight the results in court, Wall Streeters who offered comments felt there was little doubt Biden would ultimately succeed. Election predictors including the Associated Press, NBC, Fox News and Edison Research, upon which Reuters relies, called the presidency for Biden.  \u201cBiden is good news for the markets,\u201d Christopher Stanton, chief investment officer at Sunrise Capital Partners, said on Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re all so tired of the whipsaw that came with the Trump tweets.\u201d  Major U.S. stock indexes registered their biggest weekly gains since April this week, as investors bet Biden would win and Republicans would hold onto the Senate. That scenario would create a steadier hand in the Oval Office and a Congress that would check left-leaning impulses on taxes or regulations that pinch companies, investors said.  However, there are lingering risks to asset prices in the days and weeks ahead.  Republicans have already filed several lawsuits over ballot counting and Trump said his campaign will file more. The litigation could drag out election proceedings.  Investor focus also now turns to the Senate, which remains undecided ahead of two runoff elections in Georgia on Jan. 5. The significance of those races, which could potentially end up with the Democrats controlling all three of the White House, Senate and House of Representatives, means January is \u201cthe new November\u201d in terms of election volatility risk, Michael Purves, founder and CEO of Tallbacken Capital, said in a note to clients. Purves said that was evident when looking at contracts for the stockmarket\u2019s fear gauge, the VIX, stretching out into the months ahead.  Beyond those battles, investors have been worried about the people Biden might appoint to his Cabinet. Some of those officials would be negotiating with Congress about a relief package and have extensive powers to craft Wall Street rules.  Current U.S. Federal Reserve governor and former McKinsey consultant Lael Brainard\u2019s name has been floated as a potential Treasury Secretary, while Biden has already tapped former derivatives market regulator and Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker Gary Gensler for advice on financial regulation.  For the moment, investors and prominent Wall Street figures said they were happy with the election finally being called after what seemed like unending tension as ballots were counted through the week.  \u201cNow is a time for unity,\u201d JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in a statement. \u201cWe must respect the results of the U.S. presidential election and, as we have with every election, honor the decision of the voters and support a peaceful transition of power.\u201d  Leon Cooperman, a billionaire former hedge fund manager who had previously criticized Democrats said he was pleased with the results.  \u201cIt\u2019s a signal to the world that America has not changed its values,\u201d said Cooperman, of Omega Family Office. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing in my view.\u201d  Robert Wolf, a major Democratic donor and former UBS Group AG executive who now runs 32 Advisors, was enthusiastic: \u201cI am ecstatic, relieved and deeply hopeful for the future of this country,\u201d he said in a text message.  Billionaire investor Bill Ackman wrote on Twitter: \u201cThere comes a time in the battle when one should fold the tent,\u201d and urged: \u201cConcede graciously and call for unity.\u201d  The financial industry was not reacting in a bubble: major cities from New York to San Francisco erupted in celebration on Saturday. Though Trump undoubtedly has significant support throughout the country, including on Wall Street, 2020 has been a difficult year for the United States.  The coronavirus pandemic has taken a huge toll on the country, killing some 236,250 people so far, while social unrest over the police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, has only hardened divisions that already existed.  Many voters were hoping for a decisive election that would offer some calm, whichever candidate they cast ballots for.  Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz Group\u2019s chief economic adviser, said he hoped a Biden administration could work with Congress to get a handle on the pandemic and pass an economic stimulus package for struggling Americans.  \u201cThe country needs to come together to deal better with a surge in Covid infections that risks the loss of more lives, greater disruptions to livelihoods, and long-term economic, institutional and social scarring,\u201d he said.","530":"NEW YORK, Nov 5 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co said on Tuesday that it hired a team of four bankers to lead a new team in its commercial bank that connects venture capital investors with fast-growing start-ups in technology, life sciences and other fields.

FILE PHOTO: An employee holds gold bars before the refining process at AGR (African Gold Refinery) in Entebbe, Uganda, October 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Baz Ratner\/File Photo  The coronavirus has created a bonanza for investment banks dealing in gold, silver and other precious metals by triggering massive investor purchases and rupturing the normal workings of the market.  But JPMorgan has dominated, growing its share of the market.  The U.S. bank\u2019s revenue by mid-November accounts for at least half of the $1.7 billion to $2 billion that consultancy McKinsey CIB Insights estimates the top 10 investment banks combined will make this year from precious metals, mostly gold.  Its commodities division is on track to bring in more than $1.5 billion this year and could challenge Goldman Sachs for the title of top earner, the sources said.  JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.  Individual investment banks have rarely made more than $1 billion in commodities in recent years, and none has ever before earned more than around $600 million in precious metals in a single year, said George Kuznetsov at McKinsey CIB Insights.  (For a graphic on Commodities bonanza, click )  JPMorgan is the largest bank in the United States and one of the biggest in the world.  It sits at the heart of the global bullion market, and its activities span trading physical bars to derivatives, running vaults and clearing trades in London, the biggest trade hub.  REVENUE WINDFALL  Driving profit has been the clamour for gold and silver from investors, mainly in Europe and North America, worried the coronavirus pandemic and money-printing by central banks could devalue other assets.  These investors pushed gold prices to record highs above $2,000 an ounce earlier this year.  Added to that are profits earned on the Comex futures exchange in New York, where supply issues earlier this year made it more lucrative for those with access to physical gold to trade precious metals.  Banks such as JPMorgan took advantage of opportunities on Comex and helped clients do the same.  JPMorgan\u2019s client business dwarfs that of others.  Data from CME Group, which runs Comex, show JPMorgan\u2019s clients accounted for one-third of all trade in gold bars registered with the exchange in October, and more than two fifths in June.  Like other big banks, JPMorgan was able to get and ship metal cheaply and in large quantities when other, smaller traders could not, sources said.  The revenue windfall will likely fade as trading on Comex reverts to normal patterns, but high gold prices and interest from investors mean this business will remain profitable.  \u201c2020 is going to be an outlier year,\u201d said Kuznetsov at McKinsey.","548":"FILE PHOTO: Jamie Dimon, chairman & CEO of JP Morgan Chase & Co., speaks during the Bloomberg Global Business Forum in New York City, New York, U.S., September 25, 2019.

Dimon said that it was still early, but he expects most banks will add to cash reserves because economists now estimate the U.S. unemployment rate will rise to 18% by June 30, as businesses cannot yet rehire workers let go during the economic shutdown caused by the novel coronavirus.  \u201cSince CECL is very forward looking, I think that banks will have to put up a lot more credit reserves this quarter,\u201d Dimon said, referring a new accounting rule that requires banks to take provisions now for loans a borrower may default on at any point. \u201cWe would have a substantial increase in credit reserves in the second quarter.\u201d  JPMorgan's first-quarter profits plunged by roughly two-thirds because it put aside $7 billion in reserves for outstanding loans to customers. reut.rs\/2XBtsBO  Speaking at a virtual conference hosted by Deutsche Bank, Dimon said that these builds in the bank\u2019s credit reserve coffers are front-loaded and will likely taper off in the third and fourth quarters, when economists also expect the U.S. unemployment rate to fall closer to 10%.  Despite that, Dimon said there are signs the economy is regaining its footing. Customers of the largest U.S. bank are spending more on their debit cards again, bringing 2020\u2019s total spending levels back in line with that of 2019, Dimon said.

Nine Chinese local currency bonds will be included in the bank's Government Bond Index Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) suite in a 10-month process that will see the country's weighting rise to the maximum cap of 10% in the main index, the index team said in a note on Wednesday. Six of the bonds have already been issued, with the others also expected to be sold this year, the note said. The main index, GBI-EM Global Diversified, has $202 billion benchmarked against it, the bank added. Goldman Sachs calculated that the inclusion in the GBI-EM Global Diversified could pull $3 billion of investor money into China's bond market per month. Past restrictions have prevented foreign investors from tapping local bonds in the world's second largest economy. But Beijing has made access easier in recent years, most recently by launching the Bond Connect scheme in 2017 that allows investors to buy and sell onshore bonds via Hong Kong. Such improvements have nudged benchmark providers to start finally incorporating China. Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index started adding Chinese government and policy bank bonds over 20 months in April. The bonds are also on a \"watchlist\" to join FTSE Russell's World Government Bond Index (WGBI), with a review scheduled for September, the index provider has said. Goldman Sachs calculates that since index membership in April, Chinese bond markets have raked in $6-7 billion of investor money a month, and predicted that joining the WGBI could translate into another $6-7.5 billion a month. \"There is value in this market. It is cheap because it is under-invested by foreign investors at the moment,\" said Edmund Goh at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Shanghai, whose firm had been buying Chinese bonds since last year in anticipation of the index inclusion and to diversify portfolios. \"When you look around global bond markets, about one third of bonds in negative yield, the interest rate cycle (in China) has a low correlation with others.\" The inclusion is expected to reduce index yields of the GBI-EM Global Diversified and GBI-EM Global by 17 basis points and 39 basis points respectively once the process is finished. SOME PAIN AHEAD The inclusion of China will see some other countries suffer as investors adjust their portfolios. According to calculations by JPMorgan, Thailand, Poland, South Africa, Colombia and Malaysia will all see their main index weightings cut by around one percentage point. \"This is one of the biggest inclusions that has happened to emerging market countries,\" said Abhishek Kumar at State Street Global Advisors. \"...Given the current market conditions for South Africa, this can have a small impact on debt markets.\" CHINA 10% - BRAZIL 10% 10% MEXICO 9.95% 10% INDONESIA 9.47% 10% THAILAND 8.32% 9.37% POLAND 7.86% 8.86% SOUTH AFRICA 7.51% 8.49% RUSSIA 7.11% 7.99% COLOMBIA 5.54% 6.56% MALAYSIA 5.17% 6.12% HUNGARY 3.70% 4.38% CZECH REPUBLIC 3.33% 3.95% PERU 3.20% 3.80% TURKEY 3.09% 3.66% CHILE 2.94% 3.49% ROMANIA 2.09% 2.48% PHILIPPINES 0.25% 0.30% DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 0.17% 0.20% URUGUAY 0.16% 0.19% ARGENTINA 0.15% 0.17% Source: JPMorgan China's inclusion will mean 20 countries are included in the GBI-EM Global Diversified index, and its market value will rise to $1.1 trillion from $926 billion, the note said.

The efforts could help annual pretax net income rise to a range of $44 billion to $47 billion over the next three years, up from $24 billion last year, JPMorgan said.

The outlook was in line with analysts\u2019 expectations.  Last year, its ROTCE was 13 percent, excluding one-time items, compared with 11 percent at Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N, Bank of America Corp BAC.N and Morgan Stanley MS.N, and 8 percent at Citigroup Inc C.N.  \u201cManagement continues to play the long game and build even bigger competitive moats around each of its businesses by making smart growth and control-related investments that some smaller and\/or less profitable peers can\u2019t fully do,\u201d Evercore ISI bank analyst Glenn Schorr wrote in a note on Tuesday.
