REUTERS\/Mike Segar  The pandemic is a \u201cformidable and ongoing catastrophe,\u201d AIG CEO Brian Duperreault said during a call with analysts to discuss the company\u2019s second-quarter results.  But the impact will affect earnings and not capital, Duperreault said.  AIG, one of the largest U.S. insurers, on Monday posted a 56% fall in quarterly adjusted earnings, partly a result of $458 million in losses related to COVID-19 for its general insurance business.  Analysts and investors have been awaiting insurers\u2019 second-quarter results, the first full quarter of the pandemic, for a clearer picture of the impact of COVID-19 on insurers\u2019 payouts.  The pandemic has left many insurers struggling to estimate future losses and fallout for their massive investment portfolios.  Pandemic-related losses affected a larger number of insurance lines than during the first quarter, AIG\u2019s president and chief operating officer, Peter Zaffino, said during the call.  Those coverage lines include travel, property, trade credit, marine, casualty, workers\u2019 compensation, accident and health, financial lines, contingency, and AIG\u2019s reinsurance business, Validus Re, Zaffino said.  But AIG expects to recover some losses through reinsurance, Zaffino said.  A travel decline because of the pandemic hurt AIG\u2019s travel insurance business, partly contributing to a $1 billion drop in AIG\u2019s net premiums written for the quarter from a year ago, the company said.  Before the pandemic, travel insurance generated $1 billion in premiums in North America, fairly evenly spread across quarters, Zaffino said.  \u201c(T)he second quarter, you had not only no new sales. You had cancellations,\u201d Zaffino said.

The company plans to use proceeds to reduce its debt, Chief Financial Officer Mark Lyons said.

Global insurers are battling a sharp rise in natural catastrophe payouts at a time of coronavirus-induced losses. The investments that insurers rely on to pay claims have also come under pressure.","12":"March 31 (Reuters) - American International Group Inc :  * AIG SAYS CEO BRIAN DUPERREAULT\u2019S 2019 TOTAL COMPENSATION WAS $19.4 MILLION VERSUS $ 20.9 MILLION IN 2018 \u2013 SEC FILING  * AIG SAYS CFO MARK D.

FILE PHOTO: American International Group Inc. (AIG) headquarters seen on the day of the company 2017 annual shareholder meeting at 175 Water Street, New York, U.S., June 28, 2017. REUTERS\/Suzanne Barlyn  Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in Manhattan said the settlement related to seven cross-border transactions between the insurer\u2019s AIG Financial Products unit and foreign banks dating from the mid-1990s.  She said there was \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d that the seven transactions had no economic substance, and were designed to generate bogus foreign tax credits to reduce AIG\u2019s U.S. tax liabilities for the 1997 tax year.  AIG had filed a lawsuit in 2009 challenging an Internal Revenue Service decision from the prior year to disallow the tax credits and impose a 20% tax penalty.  But the government said the seven transactions enabled the New York-based insurer to \u201cgame\u201d the tax system by exploiting differences between foreign and U.S. tax laws, and \u201csucked hundreds of millions of dollars\u201d from the U.S. Treasury.  \u201cAIG created an elaborate series of sham transactions that were designed to do nothing--and in fact did nothing--other than generate hundreds of millions of dollars in ill-gotten tax benefits,\u201d Strauss said in a statement.  The settlement was approved on Thursday by U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton in Manhattan.  AIG was allowed to keep some income expense deductions, and remove some amounts related to the transactions from its taxable income. It had reached a nonbinding settlement in principle in January 2018.  \u201cWe are pleased to put this longstanding matter behind us,\u201d AIG said in a statement.

FILE PHOTO: A banner for American International Group Inc (AIG) hangs on the facade of the New York Stock Exchange, in New York, U.S., on October 16, 2012. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Excluding one-time items, adjusted fourth-quarter earnings were $526 million, or 57 cents per share, compared with an adjusted loss of $2.8 billion, or $2.72 per share, in the same period a year earlier.  Analysts were expecting earnings of 75 cents per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  AIG booked $762 million of catastrophe losses during the quarter, largely from wildfires that raged through California and caused significant damage to homes and businesses.  The quarter also reflected a \u201cmodest\u201d reserve boost to cover future claims, driven by losses in its international commercial businesses.  AIG\u2019s general insurance business posted just $13 million in adjusted pretax income, compared with a $4.9 billion loss in the year-ago quarter, which was affected by a review that caused AIG to significantly boost reserves.  The insurer\u2019s life and retirement business was also affected by a re-evaluation of its underlying method of predicting losses. The business booked a $90 million charge, primarily due to what AIG called a \u201cmodernization\u201d of actuarial systems and models.  That business\u2019 adjusted pretax income fell 10 percent to $782 million from $866 million in the year-ago quarter. Overall, AIG\u2019s bottom line was mostly hurt by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, posting $6.7 billion worth of charges related to the new tax law.  U.S. tax reform has caused many financial services companies to book big one-time losses for earnings held overseas and also for an accounting oddity related to losses booked during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, even though lower corporate tax rates will help them in the long run.  Under Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault, who has been in the role for less than a year, AIG has been looking to acquire businesses and restructure itself to boost results, with a particular focus on technology.  The insurer now has three units, including a general insurance business, a life and retirement unit and a standalone technology unit.  In its announcement on Thursday, AIG said it had recently formed a Bermuda-based legal entity named DSA Reinsurance Company. The entity\u2019s main purpose is to reinsure old policies the company has on its books, many of which have been contributing to losses.  Last month, AIG also agreed to purchase reinsurer Validus Holdings Ltd VR.N for $5.6 billion in a bid to expand its offerings and improve underwriting tools.","18":"Oct 18 (Reuters) - Insurer American International Group Inc said on Thursday it expects third-quarter pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, of between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion.  \u201cThese losses are largely associated with multiple events in Japan, including Typhoons Jebi and Trami, as well as Hurricane Florence and revisions to our loss estimates on the California mudslides,\u201d AIG said in a statement.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Still, the company\u2019s general insurance unit is on track to enter 2019 \u201cat a slight underwriting profit,\u201d AIG CEO Brian Duperreault said at the Goldman Sachs U.S. Financial Services Conference in New York.  The catastrophe losses do not include December, Duperreault said.  Duperreault, who took charge of AIG in 2017, has vowed to turn the company around. His most critical task is overhauling AIG\u2019s underwriting culture after the company spent years chasing revenue growth without appropriately weighing risks.  AIG company expects an overall eight percent adjusted return on equity going into 2019, driven in part by the slight underwriting profit in its general insurance unit, Duperreault said on Wednesday.  \u201cBut let me be clear. We are not satisfied with an eight percent,\u201d Duperreault said. The company intends to reach a double-digit adjusted return on equity, but the process could take up to three years, he added.  \u201cThe problems that AIG had when I arrived were the result of over a decade of firefighting but we are moving beyond that era,\u201d Duperreault said.  AIG expects the unit\u2019s 2019 net earned premium to be consistent with 2018 levels, Duperreault said.  Wildfires in California, net of reinsurance, will add between $150 million and $175 million to AIG\u2019s net pretax losses for the fourth quarter, since the company has triggered its reinsurance coverage, Duperreault said. AIG expects its Validus Holdings Ltd unit, the reinsurer it acquired in July, to incur about a $60 million pretax loss for wildfires, he added.  Earnings for AIG\u2019s Life and Retirement will decrease for the second half of 2019, partly related to investment in new business and \u201cgrowth initiatives,\u201d Duperreault said.  The insurer\u2019s fourth quarter effective tax rate will be around 26 percent because of global catastrophes and a shift in business mix, he said.  On Tuesday, AIG named its chief actuary, Mark Lyons as chief financial officer. Lyons replaces Sid Sankaran, who joined the company in 2015.  Sankaran will remain at AIG as an adviser through the year-end reporting process for fiscal year 2018, the company said.","21":"(Reuters) - American International Group Inc AIG.N is exiting business activities in Iran that came with a subsidiary it acquired and which now butt up against the sanctions against Iran that have been reimposed by the Trump administration, according to a filing.  Validus Holdings Ltd, a Bermuda-based reinsurer that AIG acquired for $5.56 billion in July, is winding down insurance coverage it provides to shipping companies that transport cargo to and from Iran, according to an AIG filing on Nov. 2.  The cargo includes crude oil shipped from Iran and refined petroleum products shipped to Iran, according to the filing.  In May, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six major powers designed to stall Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program and ordered sanctions reimposed on Tehran.  The United States on Monday restored sanctions targeting Iran\u2019s oil, banking and transportation sectors and threatened more action to stop its \u201coutlaw\u201d policies, steps the Islamic Republic called economic warfare and vowed to defy.  European insurers, reinsurers, brokers and shipping firms have been winding down Iranian business since May as the United States prepared to restore sanctions on insurance and reinsurance beginning on Nov. 4.  Validus subsidiaries based outside the United States provide the Iran-related insurance, which includes coverage for vessels, war, cargo and liability, AIG said.

REUTERS\/Suzanne Barlyn  Investors offered relatively weak support for AIG\u2019s pay proposals in the prior two years during the era of Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault, who joined the U.S. insurer in May, 2017 with a lucrative package and has argued that paying top dollar is the only way to recruit and retain top talent.  Two influential proxy advisory firms, which scrutinize proposals and suggest how shareholders should vote, offered cautious approval of AIG\u2019s executive pay this year, saying the board engaged with a significant portion of investors and made enough changes to warrant a \u201cyes\u201d vote.  They noted, however, that the company\u2019s stock performance has been poor, that Duperreault is rewarded more than peers and that AIG has room to improve structural issues with executive compensation.  \u201cCautionary support for the say-on-pay proposal is warranted,\u201d Institutional Shareholders Inc said in its analysis. AIG made \u201cmeaningful improvements,\u201d but its compensation remains a \u201chigh concern\u201d because of a misalignment between performance and pay.  Glass Lewis & Co also \u201ccautiously\u201d recommended approving AIG\u2019s pay proposal because of steps it took to engage with shareholders and restructure compensation packages, despite giving the company an \u201cF\u201d grade in pay-for-performance.  An AIG spokesman declined to comment on the reports.  Both firms had opposed AIG\u2019s pay packages in 2019 and 2018. Just 55% and 62% of voting shareholders threw their support behind the proposals in those years, respectively - far below the norm of 90% or more for U.S. stock issuers.  Executive compensation was a fiery issue for AIG after it received a $180 billion taxpayer bailout in 2008 while still paying executives tens of millions of dollars and funding lavish client events. The money AIG spent to hire Duperreault and the amount it has been putting toward him and other executives with few strings attached re-ignited the debate among investors.  In 2019, AIG held 32 meetings with stockholders representing 54% of outstanding shares to discuss their concerns. The company had reached out to an even wider swath of stakeholders, offering consultations with top executives or directors.  The board made some changes in response to criticism that performance metrics were subjective or vague, that they did not align closely enough with performance or that they were too short-term in nature.  For instance, AIG reduced equity grants and introduced a \u201cvesting cap\u201d that limits rewards executives can receive when the insurer does worse than its peers. It also made changes to prior awards to reflect AIG\u2019s slumping stock price.  The board, led by independent Chair Douglas Steenland, awarded Duperreault $19.4 million for 2019. That was a 7.6% decline from his pay in 2018.  AIG\u2019s total shareholder return for the three years ending in 2019 was -5.47% compared with 8.12% for a major insurance index, according to ISS.","26":"(Reuters) - Insurer American International Group Inc reported first-quarter earnings that trounced Wall Street estimates on Monday, as its general insurance business posted its first underwriting profit since the financial crisis.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Shares of the company rose more than 6 percent after Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault said he expects the company to record an underwriting profit for the full year.  The general insurance unit\u2019s underwriting income, which is the difference between premiums an insurer collects on policies and claims it pays out, was $179 million in the latest quarter, compared with an underwriting loss of $251 million a year earlier.  Adjusted income from the business rose more than two-fold to $1.27 billion.  Duperreault, who took the helm at AIG in May 2017, has been overhauling AIG\u2019s underwriting culture, which has for years focused on chasing revenue growth without appropriately weighing risks.  The CEO and his deputies have been telling staff to be more selective about clients and wind down or revise unprofitable policies. AIG is also buying reinsurance to mitigate losses on old business.  The general insurance unit\u2019s accident year combined ratio - which excludes changes from losses incurred in past years - was 96.1 for the quarter, compared with 99.7 a year earlier. A ratio below 100 percent means the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims.  The accident year ratio is a measurement that Duperreault has cited as the best gauge of the unit\u2019s long-term profitability. The number excludes catastrophe claims and reserve charges.  A tight leash on costs also helped the insurer, with its expense ratio falling 230 basis points to 34.3 from the prior-year quarter.  Gross premiums written rose 11 percent to $10.2 billion in the general insurance business, helped mostly by the performance of its commercial lines insurance in North America.

So-called say-on-pay votes are nonbinding but low results often spur directors into action to guard against losing their own seats.  AIG now hopes to win over some of the skeptical investors at this year\u2019s annual meeting, set for May 21 in New York. Potentially making the task harder will be that shares of the company declined 34 percent in 2018.  Duperreault, known in the insurance industry as a turnaround expert, took charge of AIG in May 2017.  In its proxy, filed on Tuesday, AIG listed a number of steps it has taken in response to shareholder concerns, including tying executive pay more directly to share performance.  For instance, the company said that although Duperreault could have achieved a short-term incentive award of $3.456 million, the board reduced that to $3.04 million in order to reflect \u201cshared accountability\u201d for overall company performance.  Other changes include an initiative to increase diversity among board members and ensuring that board member nominees who are also chief executive officers and up for election this year serve on only one outside board.","47":"BOSTON (Reuters) - American International Group AIG.N paid its new chief executive Brian Duperreault $43.1 million last year, a securities filing showed on Tuesday.

Excluding one-time components, Duperreault earned $14.9 million after rejoining AIG in May, according to the company\u2019s annual proxy filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  That figure was similar to the $15.3 million paid to MetLife Inc MET.N CEO and Chairman Steven Kandarian in 2016, and less than the $27.1 million paid in 2017 to John Strangfeld, chairman and CEO of Prudential Financial Inc PRU.N, according to the latest proxy filings by those companies.  Duperreault, 70, had worked for AIG until 1994 and rejoined it from a Bermuda company he founded, Hamilton Insurance Group.  As CEO he replaced Peter Hancock, who stepped down under pressure. Hancock received $24.2 million last year including a $5 million cash award \u201cfor his service through the transition\u201d to the new CEO, according to the filing.  Duperreault\u2019s payout could indicate investor angst at high CEO pay has faded with rising markets. At last year\u2019s AIG annual meeting, about 98 percent of votes cast by investors were in favor of the 2016 compensation for top executives, the company\u2019s filing states.  While Duperreault\u2019s compensation will be up for another advisory vote at its annual meeting on May 9, some investors have previously said they would approve of the pay so long as he performs.  Since his appointment AIG\u2019s shares have closed as high as $66.06 on Aug. 3. The stock closed at $54.21 on Monday.  AIG received a federal bailout during the financial crisis that eventually totaled $182.3 billion but was repaid.  Greenberg, who built the company until his ouster in 2005, on Monday suffered a legal defeat when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal he led arguing the bailout was illegal and at the expense of shareholders.  Duperreault\u2019s compensation in 2017 included a $12 million cash bonus and a one-time option award valued at $16.2 million, mostly tied to performance targets.

FILE PHOTO: Banners commemorating the 100th anniversary of American International Group Inc. adorn the New York Stock Exchange in Manhattan, New York, U.S. October 10, 2019. REUTERS\/Suzanne Barlyn\/File Photo  AIG shares were up nearly 8% in extended trading.  Zaffino, 53, who succeeds 73-year-old Brian Duperreault, will take charge in March. Zaffino will be AIG\u2019s seventh CEO since 2005.  The insurer, which ranks among the top 10 U.S. carriers by market value, said it has yet to make a decision on how to carry out the separation, beyond the board voting to establish two independent, market-leading companies.  The separation of the business could take \u201ca couple of years\u201d and may be done in phases through sales of minority stakes, according to two people familiar with the matter.  The board\u2019s decision does not rule out a single sale and any proposed transactions will also need board approval, AIG said.  The life and retirement business accounted for 34% of AIG\u2019s $49 billion (37.62 billion pounds) in 2019 adjusted revenue, compared with 64% for its general insurance business, AIG said in September.  AIG has been in the midst of a turnaround launched by Duperreault, who took charge of AIG in 2017.  Duperreault has focused on sharpening underwriting, doing more with worthwhile customers, investing in technology, restoring talent and cutting costs.  Zaffino, has been the point man to execute those goals, partly by reducing losses in the commercial property and casualty businesses and relying more on reinsurance while also modernizing technology and processes. He also helped to recruit a number of executives.  Zaffino joined AIG as global chief operating officer in 2017. His ascension to CEO was widely expected after being named president in December, but AIG had not indicated timing for the change.  AIG has struggled to right itself after a $182 billion U.S. taxpayer bailout in 2008 to save it from collapse. Since then, the company has sold off big chunks to repay the debt plus a $22.7 billion return.  It also had to work through hefty losses from claims occurring in prior years that led to more than $11.2 billion in unexpected reserve increases since 2015, most of which occurred under prior leadership.  In May 2019, AIG reported its first general insurance underwriting profit since the 2008 financial crisis, a key goal.  The separation of AIG\u2019s life insurance business echoes a move pushed by billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, who targeted the insurer in 2015 with a break-up plan that was also supported by former hedge fund manager John Paulson.  Icahn, who wanted AIG to become a smaller, simpler company, demanded that AIG spin off its life insurance unit and now former mortgage insurance business.  The move would return more cash to shareholders, Icahn had said at the time.  Icahn sold his AIG stake in 2018.  Analysts have also seen logic in a separation. While the general insurance business is prone to swings from hurricanes, wildfires and other catastrophic events, the life and retirement unit\u2019s large investment portfolio makes it highly sensitive to interest rates - and current low rates have dragged on earnings.  AIG also on Monday said that it incurred an estimated $790 million in catastrophe losses during the third quarter, net of reinsurance and before tax, including $185 million of estimated catastrophe losses for claims related to COVID-19.  The losses were broadly in line with what analysts expected.  AIG also recorded a $9 million pre-tax charge in its life insurance businesses after conducting and annual review of assumptions it has used to write life insurance policies.","50":"Brian Duperreault, President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of American International Group (AIG) speaks at the UJA-Federation of New York General Insurance Annual Event in New York City, New York, U.S., June 5, 2018.

Among the defendants named in the lawsuit filed by the Chicksaw Nation in Oklahoma state court are several underwriters for insurance marketplace Lloyd\u2019s of London, a unit of American International Group Inc and XL Insurance America, now part of AXA SA.  Representatives for Lloyd\u2019s, XL Insurance and AIG declined comment.  The Chicksaw Nation and other Oklahoma tribes have temporarily shuttered their casinos in order to curb the spread of the coronavirus.  The Native American gaming industry on March 17 requested $18 billion in federal aid as it shut casinos that are the sole source of commercial revenue for dozens of tribes in a bid to slow the spread of the disease.  The Chicksaw Nation closed its casinos because its property has been damaged due to the coronavirus pandemic and \u201ccannot be used for its intended purpose,\u201d the tribe said in a court document.  Recommendations by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to curb the spread of the coronavirus and restrictions across Oklahoma that limit restaurants to take-out service are some of the difficulties at play, said Michael Burrage, the tribe\u2019s lawyer.  \u201cPractically, you couldn\u2019t have a casino operating because of all of these issues,\u201d Burrage said.  The Chicksaw tribe said it has an \u201call risk\u201d insurance policy covering business interruptions, according to the lawsuit.  Many business interruption policies exclude coverage for pandemics and require physical damage to occur on the site. Others can be ambiguous, leading to possible coverage, legal experts said.  It was not immediately clear if the tribe\u2019s insurance excludes pandemics, and its lawyer did not immediately respond to a request to clarify the issue.  The Chicksaw lawsuit is the second in more than a week in which a business has asked a court to declare that the coronavirus is a type of \u201cdirect physical loss or damage\u201d that would require insurers to pay for lost revenue.  Lawyers for insurers and policyholders anticipate a wave of litigation over whether various insurance policies for \u201cbusiness interruption\u201d will cover losses from coronavirus-related shutdowns.  On March 16, the owners of New Orleans restaurant Oceana Grill sued Lloyd\u2019s and officials in Louisiana, asking a state court to declare that the coronavirus, whether inside or outside the restaurant, is a type of \u201cdirect physical damage\u201d that would require insurers to pay.

FILE PHOTO: Billionaire activist-investor Carl Icahn gives an interview on FOX Business Network's Neil Cavuto show in New York, U.S. on February 11, 2014. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  The activist investor started accumulating AIG shares in 2015 and became its third largest investor with a 4.76 percent stake as of the end of 2017.  But Icahn began planning to sell that stake last year as it became evident that AIG would name Brian Duperreault, an industry veteran who would oppose demands to break up the company, as its new CEO, said a second person familiar with the matter.  Both people spoke to Reuters on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.  Icahn exited AIG when the company\u2019s stock changed hands at a price between $60 and $65 - levels last seen in February, one of the sources said.  At $65 per AIG share, Icahn\u2019s stake would have been worth $2.78 billion, according to Reuters\u2019 calculations.  It was not immediately known how much Icahn made from the AIG investment.  AIG shares fell nearly 1 percent to $52.30 in morning trade on Monday.  Icahn Enterprises IEP.O did not immediately respond to a request for comment and AIG declined to comment.  In the company\u2019s first quarter investor presentation released last week, AIG was not included on a list of significant holdings. Its presentation for the fourth quarter of 2017 had shown AIG as the largest of five significant holdings.  In keeping with his aggressive activist investment strategy, Icahn had publicly pressed AIG to shrink and threatened a proxy fight with the company\u2019s management.  The insurer was forced to embark on a two-year turnaround plan developed by former Chief Executive Officer Peter Hancock, which intended to return $25 billion to shareholders.  The company also sold some assets and hired Duperreault, spurring Icahn to back off on his demand to break up the company.  In March, AIG said Samuel Merksamer, a representative of Icahn on the company\u2019s board, would not seek re-election.  On Wednesday, AIG shareholders will vote on a $43.1 million 2017 compensation package for Duperreault, who has vowed to grow the company by making acquisitions and boosting revenues.","69":"June 29 (Reuters) - Heritage Insurance Holdings Inc :  * HERITAGE ANNOUNCES AGREEMENT WITH AIG PRIVATE CLIENT GROUP AND SAFECO  * HERITAGE INSURANCE HOLDINGS - TO OFFER AIG\u2019S PCG AGENTS ABILITY TO TRANSITION UPPER MIDDLE MARKET PERSONAL INSURANCE BUSINESS TO SAFECO AND HERITAGE  * HERITAGE INSURANCE HOLDINGS INC - HERITAGE AND SAFECO WILL WORK TOGETHER TO SEAMLESSLY TRANSITION AIG CUSTOMERS AT RENEWAL Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","70":"June 10 (Reuters) - American International Group Inc :  * AIG LIFE & RETIREMENT - ANNOUNCED LAUNCH OF NEW AQR DYNAMIQ ALLOCATION INDEX Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","71":"Feb 9 (Reuters) - American International Group:  * CEO SAYS INSURER WILL BE \u201cA PREDICTABLE BUYER OF REINSURANCE\u201d IN FUTURE - CONF CALL  * CFO EXPECTS ADJUSTED TAX RATE FOR 2018 OF ABOUT 21 PERCENT TO 22 PERCENT FOR 2018  * CFO SAYS EXPECTS CASH RETURNS IN HIGH SINGLE DIGIT RANGE FROM VALIDUS HOLDINGS ACQUISITION  * EXEC EXPECTS 2018 PREMIUM VOLUME TO BE RELATIVELY FLAT WITH 2017 LEVELS  * EXEC SAYS WILL TAKE A \u201cMORE STRATEGIC APPROACH TO REINSURANCE\u201d INVOLVING SMALLER NET LINES IN PROPERTY, CASUALTY  * EXEC SAYS TAX RATE CHANGE DOES NOT AFFECT FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, WHICH IT EXPECTS TO FULLY USE BEFORE THEY EXPIRE  * EXEC EXPECTS 2018 NET INVESTMENT INCOME FOR CORE INSURANCE BUSINESSES AND LEGACY PORTFOLIOS TO BE ABOUT $13 BILLION, ASSUMING 6 PERCENT TO 8 PERCENT RETURNS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Reporting by Suzanne Barlyn)","72":"March 15 (Reuters) - American International Group Inc :  * AIG CEO BRIAN DUPERREAULT\u2019S FORM 4 DISCLOSES GRANT OF 70,059 2018 RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, THAT CONVERT TO AIG COMMON STOCK ON A 1 TO 1 BASIS - SEC FILING  * AIG CEO BRIAN DUPERREAULT\u2019S 2018 RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS VEST IN JANUARY 2021, AND ARE SETTLED IN SHARES OF AIG COMMON STOCK  * AIG CEO BRIAN DUPERREAULT'S AWARD INCLUDES DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS PAYABLE IN FORM OF ADDITIONAL 2018 RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS Source text (bit.ly\/2Irgmgu) Further company coverage: (Reuters.Brief@thomsonreuters.com)","73":"(Corrects sixth paragraph to show that wildfire losses will add $150 mln to $250 mln to net pretax losses, not that reinsurance will add those amounts)  Dec 5 (Reuters) - American International Group Inc has racked up an estimated $750 million to $800 million in catastrophe losses so far during the 2018 fourth quarter, its chief executive officer said on Wednesday.  Still, the company\u2019s general insurance unit is on track to enter 2019 \u201cat a slight underwriting profit,\u201d AIG CEO Brian Duperreault said at the Goldman Sachs U.S. Financial Services Conference in New York.  The catastrophe losses do not include December, Duperreault said.  AIG expects the unit\u2019s 2019 net earned premium to be consistent with 2018 levels, Duperreault.  Duperreault, who took charge of AIG in 2017, has vowed to turn the company around. His most critical task is overhauling AIG\u2019s underwriting culture after the company spent years chasing revenue growth without appropriately weighing risks.  Wildfires in California, net of reinsurance, will add between $150 million and $175 million to AIG\u2019s net pretax losses for the fourth quarter, since the company has triggered its reinsurance coverage, Duperreault said. AIG expects its Validus Holdings Ltd unit, the reinsurer it acquired in July, to incur about a $60 million pretax loss for wildfires, Duperreault said.  Earnings for AIG\u2019s Life and Retirement will decrease for the second half of 2019, partly related to investment in new business and \u201cgrowth initiatives,\u201d Duperreault said.  The insurer\u2019s fourth quarter effective tax rate will be around 26 percent because of global catastrophes and a shift in business mix, Duperreault said.

Zaffino, known by colleagues for his laser-like focus, remained at his desk as staff began fleeing.  FILE PHOTO: American International Group Inc. (AIG) headquarters seen on the day of the company\u00d5s 2017 annual shareholder meeting at 175 Water Street, New York, U.S., June 28, 2017. REUTERS\/Suzanne Barlyn  It was not until a fire warden pleaded with Zaffino \u2013 who was then an executive at reinsurance brokerage Guy Carpenter \u2013 that he finally left, a person familiar with the situation said.  Zaffino, 53, is now poised to become the next chief executive of American International Group Inc AIG.N, one of the largest U.S. insurers, after being named president in December.  Current CEO Brian Duperreault, 72, who has not said that he is leaving, hired Zaffino as AIG\u2019s chief operating officer in 2017 and soon after also named him head of AIG\u2019s general insurance business.  AIG declined to comment on succession planning. Zaffino did not respond to a request for comment.  Reuters spoke to 11 associates who offered a portrait of what Zaffino may be like as AIG\u2019s next CEO, as is widely expected.  They said Zaffino is as rigorous about underwriting as he is enthusiastic about revenue growth. He expects his team to rattle off performance statistics on demand while knowing how they align with the company\u2019s goals.  AIG\u2019s next CEO will be the seventh since 2005. The company is in the midst of a turnaround launched by Duperreault nearly three years ago.  Zaffino is described as a hard-driving \u201cnumbers guy\u201d who digs deep into raw data to evaluate business lines instead of relying on managers\u2019 reports.  \u201cHe appears demanding and task-oriented,\u201d said Credit Suisse analyst Andrew Kligerman. \u201cThe good part is that he will likely work extremely hard and press his team to work extremely hard to achieve the objectives.\u201d  Added another person who knows Zaffino and who spoke on condition of anonymity: \u201cYou can\u2019t outwork him. He\u2019s on the job 24-7.\u201d  The person described Zaffino as always \u201con,\u201d coaching his deputies during short car trips between events at off-site management meetings.  SOCCER GOALIE  Zaffino is fiercely competitive and disciplined, characteristics that date back to when he played as a Boston College soccer goalie and trained with the U.S. Men\u2019s national team, they said.  Zaffino grew up as his father, longtime insurance executive Salvatore Zaffino, rose through the ranks of the industry, exposing him to industry leaders.  An operating chief is generally next in line for the CEO job, executive consultants said. That does not always happen, but naming that person president typically signals an imminent transition, perhaps within a year.  AIG has struggled to right itself after accepting a $182 billion U.S. taxpayer bailout in 2008 to save it from collapse. Since then, the company has sold off big chunks to pay back the debt plus a $22.7 billion return. It also had to work through hefty losses from claims occurring in prior years that led to more than $11.2 billion in unexpected reserve increases since 2015, most of which occurred under prior leadership.  LOOKING BEYOND DAMAGE REPAIR  Analysts and investors want Duperreault to be the last CEO whose chief responsibility is fixing old problems instead of finding ways to increase revenue. When AIG reports 2019 earnings on Thursday, Wall Street is hoping it will have significantly improved commercial underwriting profit, and is on track to meet a double-digit return-on-equity goal by 2021.  In May, AIG reported its first underwriting profit in general insurance since the financial crisis, a key goal.  Before joining AIG, Zaffino accumulated a wealth of experience as CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc\u2019s MMC.N reinsurance arm and its retail insurance brokerage. He was also an executive for a former General Electric Co GE.N subsidiary that focused on alternative risk insurance and reinsurance, after launching his career at Hartford Financial Services Group Inc HIG.N.  Duperreault has focused on sharpening underwriting, doing more with worthwhile customers, investing in technology, restoring talent and cutting costs.  Zaffino has been the point man to execute those goals, partly by mitigating losses in commercial property and casualty businesses and relying more on reinsurance while also modernizing technology and processes. He also helped to recruit a number of executives.  Nonetheless, AIG\u2019s stock has dropped more than 11% since the current management team arrived. Analysts say whoever runs AIG next will have to fix that, too.  \u201cThey want things to happen right now,\u201d said Piper Sandler analyst Paul Newsome, of AIG\u2019s executives. \u201cIf you are working in that group, you are under pressure to do it right, do it now, and do it big.\u201d","75":"FILE PHOTO: The AIG logo is seen at its building in New York's financial district March 19, 2015.

Two influential proxy advisory firms, International Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, have advised shareholders to reject the package in the non-binding vote, saying it did not align with AIG\u2019s performance.  AIG\u2019s stock has dropped 13 percent since Duperreault took charge of the company last May.  The company\u2019s pay arrangements include $24.2 million for former CEO Peter Hancock, who stepped down last year under pressure, with a $5 million cash award \u201cfor his service through the transition\u201d to Duperreault, according to the company\u2019s annual proxy filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in March.  It is unusual for both advisory firms to recommend voting against pay measures for the same company. ISS recommends votes against pay only about 12 percent of the time for companies listed on the broad-based Russell 3000 stock index, an ISS spokesman said.  That could sway shareholders, corporate governance experts said.  \u201cIt seems that investors do react to these recommendations,\u201d Jill Brown, a management professor at Waltham, Massachusetts-based Bentley University, said in an email.  Brown pointed to a March non-binding vote by Walt Disney Co shareholders, who rejected a $48.5 million executive compensation plan for Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger by a 52 percent majority.  Both proxy advisory firms had advised against Iger\u2019s package.  GRADED \u2018F\u2019  Glass Lewis gave AIG\u2019s package a letter grade of \u201cF.\u201d  \u201cOverall, the company paid significantly more than its peers, but performed significantly worse than its peers,\u201d the report said.  ISS said one-time awards to Duperreault when he joined the company, including a $12 million cash bonus, were not tied to performance.  AIG declined to comment on the proxy recommendations.  AIG\u2019s board compensation committee \u201cbelieves this award properly motivates Mr. Duperreault to create sustainable, profitable growth for AIG, aligning his interests with those of our shareholders,\u201d the proxy filing states.  Some investors have previously said they would approve of Duperreault\u2019s pay so long as he performs.  Duperreault has vowed to help the company expand and boost revenue. He has been working to improve underwriting practices, increase AIG\u2019s focus on technology and install new executives across the insurer to jumpstart profits.  AIG is also preparing to finalize its acquisition of reinsurer Validus Holdings Ltd.  But his steps have yet to boost the bottom line.  In March, AIG said it paid Duperreault $43.1 million last year, according to the proxy filing. Excluding one-time components, Duperreault earned $14.9 million.  That figure was similar to the $15.3 million paid to MetLife Inc CEO and Chairman Steven Kandarian in 2016, and less than the $27.1 million paid in 2017 to John Strangfeld, chairman and CEO of Prudential Financial Inc, according to proxy filings by those companies.  AIG shares have closed as high as $66.06 on Aug. 3, compared with $61.82 on the first trading day following his mid-May appointment.  The stock ended down 0.4 percent on Tuesday at $53.08.

AIG and Merksamer declined to comment. Merksamer was a managing director at Icahn Capital, a unit of Icahn Enterprises LP from 2008 until leaving Icahn\u2019s firm last year.  An Icahn spokesman was not immediately available for comment.  Icahn is AIG\u2019s third-largest investor, holding a 4.76 percent stake in the company at the end of the 2017.  Icahn has shaken up management teams and business strategies at many companies, using deputies like Merksamer to implement changes he deems necessary.  When Icahn first began acquiring his stake in 2015, he advocated splitting AIG into three parts.  The insurer instead embarked on a two-year turnaround plan developed by former Chief Executive Officer Peter Hancock, which intended to return $25 billion to shareholders.  AIG announced in March 2017 that Hancock was stepping down. CEO Brian Duperreault took charge of the insurance giant in May, saying that he wanted to grow the company.  In January, AIG said it would buy reinsurer Validus Holdings Ltd (VR.N) for $5.56 billion in cash, its largest acquisition since the global financial crisis.","84":"(Reuters) - American International Group Inc said on Wednesday it is hiking some commercial insurance rates by as much as 45%, a trend it sees persisting in 2021, as the company prepares to install Peter Zaffino as its new chief executive on March 1.

It said it was still \u201cactively working towards\u201d an initial public offering for an initial 19.9% stake, but also was weighing the interest from private buyers. AIG\u2019s sale comes as insurers are making deals at a frenzied pace.  The company has not said what route it would take with the remaining 80.1% stake, but has indicated it does not intend to break up the business.  AIG\u2019s higher insurance rates reflected \u201cconsiderable improvement and tighter terms and conditions,\u201d Zaffino, who is now president, told analysts on a conference call.  Commercial business rate increases were about 15%, but the figures varied across different business lines, including a 45% increase in the insurer\u2019s excess casualty insurance, a type of specialty coverage, Zaffino said.  Rate increases in the insurer\u2019s financial lines business were over 25%, led by 35% increases for directors and officers liability coverage, Zaffino said.  AIG\u2019s global energy rates rose more than 30%, the company said.  On Tuesday, AIG posted adjusted earnings that hit analysts\u2019 targets.  AIG has struggled to right itself after a $182 billion U.S. taxpayer bailout in 2008 to save it from collapse. Since then, the company has sold off big chunks to repay the debt plus about $22.7 billion in investment returns.  Current CEO Brian Duperreault, who took the helm of AIG in 2017, handpicked Zaffino to work alongside him in an effort to turn the company around.  A key focus was transforming AIG\u2019s general insurance business where Duperreault and Zaffino set about overhauling AIG\u2019s underwriting culture after years spent chasing revenue growth without appropriately weighing risks.  In May 2019, AIG\u2019s general insurance business posted its first underwriting profit since the global financial crisis, a key goal.  AIG announced the planned separation of its life and retirement business in October and expects the transaction to happen over the course of 2021.  The life and retirement business accounted for 34% of AIG\u2019s $49 billion in 2019 adjusted revenue, compared with 64% for its general insurance business, AIG has said.  The separation of AIG\u2019s life insurance business echoes a move pushed by billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, who targeted the insurer in 2015 with a breakup plan that was also supported by former hedge fund manager John Paulson.  Icahn demanded that AIG spin off its life insurance unit and now former mortgage insurance business, a move that he said would return more cash to shareholders.

Performance was hurt by $276 million in private-equity losses compared with $238 million in private-equity income a year ago which included a large gain from one of the holdings.  AIG\u2019s general insurance accident year combined ratio excluding changes from losses incurred in past years, was 94.9 for the quarter, compared with 96.1 a year ago.  AIG has been using the metric to gauge the success of a turnaround plan launched by Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault upon taking the insurer\u2019s helm in 2017.  A ratio below 100 means the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims.  Gross premiums written fell 2% to $8.47 billion in the general insurance business.  AIG\u2019s life and retirement unit posted $881 million in adjusted pretax income compared with $1.0 billion a year ago, driven partly by private-equity losses and deaths from COVID-19.

Duperreault took charge of AIG nearly a year ago, promising to grow the company and boost revenues. He has been working to improve underwriting practices, increase AIG\u2019s focus on technology and install new executives across the insurer to jumpstart profits.  But his steps have yet to boost the bottom line. The stock is down nearly 16 percent since Duperreault\u2019s arrival in May 2017. AIG\u2019s shares were trading at $51.36 on Thursday afternoon after a morning slump during which share were down more than 9 percent.  \u201cGiven the results from some other commercial lines insurers in the quarter everyone was expecting a stronger number from AIG, especially in North American commercial business,\u201d said Elyse Greenspan, a Wells Fargo Securities LLC analyst, in an interview.  The unit has been a \u201cconsistent area of focus\u201d for AIG and one which the insurer\u2019s former management team was unable to fix, Greenspan said.  AIG\u2019s changes to underwriting practices will take some time to show up in the company\u2019s income statement, said Peter Zaffino, chief executive of AIG\u2019s general insurance unit, during the call. But a combination of managing expenses and improving ratios of losses to premiums will contribute to AIG\u2019s year-end financial performance, Zaffino said.  The company is also making changes to excess casualty business, trying to shed certain risky bets such as being the lead insurer for initial public offerings and professional liabilities, Duperreault said.  AIG also reported on Wednesday that it had released $104 million in reserves from its general insurance unit, the first such development since 2016.  The measure alleviated some investor angst, Greenspan said, after the insurer had to set aside funds in 2016 and 2017 to cover possible future claims.","90":"(Reuters) - Insurer American International Group Inc AIG.N on Thursday reported a quarterly profit that beat estimates, as the company booked underwriting income in its general insurance business.

Underwriting income is the difference between premiums an insurer collects on policies and claims it pays out.  Net pre-tax catastrophe loss at the general insurance unit narrowed to $411 million from $826 million, a year earlier.  AIG shares were down about 2.5% at $52.90 in late morning trading.  Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault, who joined the insurer in 2017, has been overhauling the underwriting culture at AIG\u2019s general insurance business through initiatives including raising rates and shedding unprofitable lines.  Total net investment income rose 30% to $3.6 billion in the reported quarter.  AIG\u2019s general insurance accident year combined ratio, a key metric, which excludes changes from losses incurred in past years, was 95.8 for the quarter, compared with 98.8 a year earlier.  A ratio below 100 means the insurer earned more in premiums than it paid out in claims.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say given all the issues at AIG over the last decade-plus, but I honestly can\u2019t remember the last time AIG had a full year underwriting profit,\u201d Duperreault said on a call with analysts.  AIG expects to invest $1.3 billion in the company through 2022 as part of an effort to modernize technology and processes while cutting expenses, said Peter Zaffino, AIG president and chief operating officer. The programs will deliver $1 billion in savings by the end of 2022, he said.  The changes will play out through 10 programs, including building a new underwriting system in the general insurance unit and transforming AIG\u2019s Japanese insurance business into a \u201cnext-generation digital insurance company,\u201d Zaffino said.  Net income attributable to the company\u2019s shareholders was $922 million, or $1.03 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared to a loss of $622 million, or 70 cents per share, a year earlier.  On an adjusted basis, AIG earned $1.03 per share, beating Refinitiv estimates of $1.00.  The insurer also said it expects to pay $1.7 billion as part of a tax settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which could be made as early as the first quarter of 2020.

The insurer posted $938 million, or $1.01 per share, in net income for the first quarter, down from $1.2 billion, or $1.18 per share in the same period a year earlier.  On an adjusted basis, its earnings were $963 million, or $1.04 per share, compared with $1.37 billion, or $1.36 per share, in the same period a year earlier.  Analysts were expecting earnings of $1.27, on average, per share, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S, after lowering their estimates by about 6 percent since last June. It was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable.  Mudslides in California, winter storms across the United States and an earthquake in Papua New Guinea contributed to $376 million worth of catastrophe losses in AIG\u2019s general insurance business during the quarter.  Those costs slashed the unit\u2019s quarterly adjusted pretax income by more than half, to $510 million from $1.1 billion in the year-earlier period, and drove its expense and loss ratios higher.  In AIG\u2019s life and retirement business, adjusted pretax income fell 1 percent to $892 million. The insurer attributed that decline to lower-yielding assets.  The results mark the end of three full quarters for AIG under Chief Executive Officer Brian Duppereault, who took charge of AIG last May, vowing to grow the company and boost revenues.  He has since been working to improve underwriting practices, increase AIG\u2019s focus on technology and install new executives across the insurer to jumpstart profits. But his steps have yet to boost the bottom line, and AIG\u2019s stock is down 10 percent since Duperreault\u2019s arrival on May 14, 2017.

The American insurance and financial services giant has sponsored NZR\u2019s national teams since 2012 and signed a six-year renewal in 2016, with local media reporting the agreements were worth US$10 million to $20 million a year.  The sponsorship, reportedly NZR\u2019s second largest behind a multi-year contract with sportswear manufacturer adidas , was to end in late 2021.  NZR\u2019s largest revenue stream comes from television agreements, with local subscription broadcaster Sky TV reportedly paying NZ$500 million ($331.35 million) for another five-year term starting from 2021.  \u201cWe have enjoyed a hugely successful and mutually beneficial commercial partnership that has helped both AIG and NZR to strengthen our respective brands on the world stage,\u201d NZR Chief Executive Mark Robinson said in a statement.  \u201cThrough this partnership, NZR and the six national teams sponsored by AIG have been able to grow rugby\u2019s presence in new and growing markets, with opportunities to play in new territories and introduce our teams to new fans all over the world.\u201d  While the country\u2019s national teams are powerhouses of world rugby, the small financial resources and population in New Zealand have made it increasingly difficult for NZR to generate similar revenues to other sports or global sporting brands.  They announced a NZ$1.9 million loss for their last financial year in 2018 and while they had strong net assets, Chairman Brent Impey at its annual general meeting in April said future projections showed a \u201cchallenging\u201d environment.  \u201cAlthough we are pleased with our latest financial result these are still challenging times for rugby as we look further ahead,\u201d Impey said at the time.  \u201cThe pressure to retain our talent and support the growth in our community game puts pressure on our long-term financial projections.\u201d  The organisation is locked in a continual battle to retain players, with clubs in Britain, France and more recently Japan enticing All Blacks to the northern hemisphere with large salaries.  NZR\u2019s only leverage is a policy of picking just those who are locally based for national sides, although they have made exceptions in recent years to structure flexible contracts for individual players.

Influential proxy advisory firms International Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis had advised shareholders to reject the resolution, saying the pay package did not align with AIG\u2019s performance.  AIG\u2019s stock has dropped 13 percent since Duperreault took charge of the company last May.  The company\u2019s pay arrangements include $24.2 million for former CEO Peter Hancock, who stepped down last year under pressure, with a $5 million cash award \u201cfor his service through the transition\u201d to Duperreault, according to its annual proxy filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in March.

AIG\u2019s board compensation committee \u201cbelieves this award properly motivates Mr. Duperreault to create sustainable, profitable growth for AIG, aligning his interests with those of our shareholders,\u201d the proxy filing states.  Some investors have said they would approve of Duperreault\u2019s pay so long as he performs.  Duperreault has vowed to help the company expand and boost revenue. He has been working to improve underwriting practices, increase a focus on technology and install new executives across the insurer to jumpstart profits.  AIG is preparing to finalize its acquisition of reinsurer Validus Holdings Ltd VR.N.  But his steps have yet to boost the bottom line.  In March, AIG said it paid Duperreault $43.1 million last year, according to the proxy filing. Excluding one-time components, Duperreault earned $14.9 million.  That figure was similar to the $15.3 million paid to MetLife Inc MET.N CEO and Chairman Steven Kandarian in 2016, and less than the $27.1 million paid in 2017 to John Strangfeld, chairman and CEO of Prudential Financial Inc PRU.N, according to proxy filings by those companies.

REUTERS\/Robert Galbraith  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Anyone who has held shares in American International Group since the end of 2007 is still nursing a 95 percent stock-price loss. That\u2019s even worse than fellow crisis basket case Citigroup. The insurer is, arguably, finally emerging from a lost decade after receiving a controversial $182 billion U.S. government bailout in 2008. But investors remain wary.  The disaster 10 years ago centered on AIG\u2019s financial-products unit, which had sold huge amounts of supposedly not-very-risky credit protection on subprime-mortgage products. The consequences included a $62 billion loss in a single quarter, the final period of 2008.  Employees were vilified, and some critics labeled the bailout a conspiracy to help banks, because it enabled AIG to pay billions to trading counterparties including Goldman Sachs and European institutions like Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and Deutsche Bank.  AIG offloaded assets including its historic Asian life-insurance arm AIA, which has more than tripled in value since it was floated in Hong Kong in 2010. Repaying the government in full in December 2012 was a signal achievement of the then chief executive, the late Bob Benmosche.  Revenue shrank steadily under Benmosche, Peter Hancock and, since May last year, Brian Duperreault, as successive CEOs fought to bring both continuing businesses and problematic legacy lines under control. Duperreault is an industry guru and veteran of AIG, insurer ACE, Marsh & McLennan and Bermuda-based Hamilton Insurance. Ask around his head office in New York, and people say he is a leader who can make the company hum again and who\u2019s assembling a stellar team.  The removal of AIG\u2019s \u201csystemically important\u201d designation by regulators last year was a landmark, too. It even looks like a different company: without AIA, with a focus on stronger underwriting practices, and with ambitions to grow again. The company in July closed its biggest acquisition since the crisis \u2013 the $5.5 billion purchase of Validus, a Bermuda reinsurer with a Lloyd\u2019s syndicate and catastrophe-bond asset manager. Yet AIG still isn\u2019t back to profitable growth, and the roughly $50 billion group\u2019s shares are priced at a nearly 25 percent discount to book value, far lower than most peers. Investors don\u2019t yet accept that the company\u2019s dismal recent past is behind it. Maybe that\u2019s something AIG can achieve in 2019, its centennial year.","108":"The AIG logo is seen at its building in New York's financial district March 19, 2015.

FILE PHOTO - Maurice \"Hank\" Greenberg, former chairman of American International Group Inc., (AIG) arrives at the New York State Supreme Courthouse in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., September 29, 2016. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The justices left in place a 2017 ruling by a federal appeals court in Washington that Greenberg\u2019s Starr International Co had no legal right to challenge the bailout because that right belonged to AIG, which chose not to sue.  Greenberg, 92, led AIG for nearly four decades before being ousted in March 2005. The New York-based insurance powerhouse was rescued by the U.S. government in September 2008 to stave off bankruptcy after the company ran up huge losses from insurance on shoddy mortgage securities.  Starr\u2019s attorney David Boies expressed disappointment in the Supreme Court\u2019s action.  \u201cStarr established that the disproportionate and unfair treatment of AIG\u2019s shareholders in 2008 was not authorized by the applicable statutes and that the government had exceeded its authority by taking control of AIG and using it to bail out other financial institutions, which were found to have engaged in more risky practices,\u201d Boies said in a statement.  Starr, an insurance and investment business that had been one of AIG\u2019s largest shareholders, sued in 2011 on behalf of itself and other shareholders alleging the government illegally took a 79.9 percent stake in the company in exchange for a $85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The shareholders\u2019 rights were diminished in violation of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s guarantee of due process under the law, Starr claimed, seeking more than $40 billion in damages.  A lower court ruled in Starr\u2019s favor, but declined to award damages since the shareholders\u2019 stock would have been worthless without the government loan. The bailout actually helped the plaintiff, that court said.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit threw out that ruling, finding that only AIG, and not Starr as a shareholder, had legal standing to bring claims that the bailout was unlawful. AIG\u2019s board of directors decided not to file such a suit.  AIG\u2019s bailout eventually totaled $182.3 billion but was repaid, leaving taxpayers with nearly $23 billion in profit.  Starr appealed to the Supreme Court. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration urged the justices not to take up the appeal.","111":"(Reuters) - American International Group Inc AIG.N reported a smaller quarterly loss on Wednesday as reinsurance pacts helped offset steep catastrophe losses in Japan and North America.  FILE PHOTO: The AIG logo is seen at its building in New York's financial district in New York, NY, U.S. on March 19, 2015. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  The insurer posted a net loss of $1.26 billion, or $1.41 per share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $1.74 billion, or $1.91 per share, a year earlier.  AIG recorded net pretax catastrophe losses of $1.6 billion in the quarter, mainly related to typhoons in Japan and Hurricane Florence, that were largely in line with the insurer\u2019s preview of those losses in mid-October.  The figures, far worse than analysts were expecting, helped spur a 13 percent drop in AIG shares during recent weeks. The shares were down 1.1 percent in after-hours trade on Wednesday.  AIG\u2019s revised estimates for California mudslides also contributed to its losses.  AIG Chief Executive Brian Duperreault, who took charge in May 2017, has vowed to turn the company around and post an underwriting profit as soon as year-end.  But some analysts are not convinced his plan is working. \u201cThe third quarter results do not suggest progress in and of themselves,\u201d Sandler O\u2019Neill analyst Paul Newsome said in an interview.  AIG has not made much progress in improving underwriting profit in its commercial property and casualty insurance business, even without the catastrophe losses, Newsome said. But there are some signs that AIG\u2019s loss ratio is improving, he said.  AIG estimated it has exhausted about $700 million of the $750 million available through its North American catastrophe reinsurance program following the mudslides, Hurricane Florence and loss estimate from Hurricane Michael, which crashed into Florida earlier this month.  The adjusted pretax loss from the general insurance business narrowed 72 percent to $825 million, while the underwriting loss narrowed to $1.73 billion from $3.8 billion a year ago.  Adjusted pretax income from the life and retirement business fell 38 percent to $713 million, driven by changes to some actuarial assumptions following an annual review.  The company\u2019s combined ratio fell to 124.4 percent from 157.1 percent. A ratio below 100 percent means the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims.  Loss ratio fell to 88.6 percent from 124.1 percent in the year-ago quarter, when it recorded pretax catastrophe losses of $3 billion related to hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.  On an adjusted basis, it lost 34 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 12 cents, according to I\/B\/E\/S data from Refinitiv. It was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable.","112":"Aug 2 (Reuters) - American International Group Inc on Thursday reported a 17 percent fall in quarterly profit due to ongoing issues in its general insurance business, missing analysts\u2019 expectations.  Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault, who took charge more than a year ago, has been trying to turn around the company and its commercial insurance business, including by sharpening underwriting practices.  The company\u2019s second-quarter results included a $200 million restructuring charge related to \u201cefficiency initiatives,\u201d including compensation.  AIG has been on a hiring spree to bring on new executives to boost profits. On Wednesday, AIG said it hired veteran industry executive David McElroy to head its Lexington Insurance Company unit.  He has previously served as executive chairman of Arch Insurance Group Inc. and vice chairman of Arch Worldwide Insurance Group.  Adjusted pre-tax income from AIG\u2019s general insurance business dropped 46 percent to $568 million, while underwriting income swung to a loss of $89 million compared with a profit of $149 million a year ago.  Duperreaut has launched an underwriting review and increased focus on technology in an effort to jumpstart the company\u2019s shares.  The adjusted pre-tax income from the company\u2019s life and retirement business fell 3 percent to $962 million in the quarter.  The insurer posted $937 million, or $1.02 per share, in net income for the second quarter, down from $1.13 billion, or $1.19 per share, a year ago.  On an adjusted basis, it earned $1.05 per share.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc AIG.N Chief Executive Brian Duperreault said on Wednesday he sees \"huge potential\" within the insurer's portfolio for use of a market in which investors trade assets tied to insurance liabilities.  The insurance linked securities (ILS) market, which developed over the past couple of decades as a way for insurers to pass on to investors some of their risks, mainly those associated with natural disasters, is a \"good tool,\" Duperreault said at an insurance conference sponsored by investment bank KBW, a unit of Stifel Financial Corp SF.N.  \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see more of it, not less of it\u201d within AIG, Duperreault said.  Insurance companies that participate in the market typically issue catastrophe bonds, or CAT bonds. If no catastrophe hits, the bonds pay out a percentage of the premiums by way of coupons. But if a disaster does occur, the insurance company can use the funds to pay claims to its policy holders.  AIG\u2019s acquisition of Bermuda-based Validus Holdings Ltd, which was finalized in July, included Validus\u2019 AlphaCat unit, an investment adviser that manages capital for investors and AIG through insurance-linked securities and other investments.  The insurance-linked securities market gives insurers another way for their underwriters to match risks they take on with sources of capital to cover potential claims, Duperreault said.","114":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brian Duperreault, who rejoined American International Group Inc AIG.N as chief executive officer last year to turn the company around, remembers another era when the insurer was trying to blaze a trail toward greatness.  In 1973, Duperreault arrived at AIG\u2019s old Lower Manhattan office to interview for an actuarial position. The company\u2019s name was painted on the brick exterior of the building and linoleum tiles were missing from the floor inside, leaving spots of exposed cement and old, dried glue.  He was 26, fresh out of the U.S. Army and knew nothing about the insurance business, but Duperreault was sold on AIG\u2019s scrappy vibe and high-energy employees.  \u201cI had made a choice with my heart and not with my head,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBut it worked out pretty well.\u201d  Now 71, Duperreault is taking a different gamble at the other end of his career, trying to restore lost shine to a company that has struggled ever since a $182 billion taxpayer bailout saved it from collapse in 2008.  AIG finished repaying the debt, plus a $22.7 billion return, in 2012, but is still wrestling with the consequences of its near-death, including the sale of prized businesses to repay the U.S. government, and a post-bailout talent drain.  In two interviews, Duperreault detailed plans to expand AIG\u2019s international reach, improve underwriting practices and make employees feel proud to work at AIG, but also more accountable for performance.  As AIG\u2019s sixth CEO in a decade, Duperreault is bringing back some practices from the era of Maurice \u201cHank\u201d Greenberg, the man who built AIG into a global insurance colossus. For example, Duperreault is letting business heads set their own budgets and performance goals, and giving underwriters more autonomy.  Duperreault is also hunting for acquisitions that will boost performance and reestablish AIG\u2019s broad reach outside the United States.  Possible targets could include an international life or an employee benefits business. The latter would enhance AIG\u2019s Life and Retirement business and could also cater to commercial customers who have asked for the service, people familiar with the matter said.  SMART RISK-TAKING  But Duperreault\u2019s most critical task is overhauling AIG\u2019s underwriting culture after years spent chasing revenue growth without appropriately weighing risks.  Duperreault and his deputies have been telling staff to be more selective about clients and wind down or revise unprofitable policies. AIG is also buying reinsurance to mitigate losses on old business.  American International Group Inc (AIG) Chief Executive Officer, Brian Duperreault poses in this photo provided August 29, 2018. AIG\/Handout via REUTERS  \u201cWhy are we performing badly when others are performing okay or pretty good?\u201d Duperreault said. \u201cIt really just goes back to smart risk-taking. You can\u2019t play every hand.\u201d  Duperreault\u2019s immediate challenge, as he describes it, is to get the company underwriting risks profitable again \u2013 a key measure of an insurer\u2019s performance and something AIG has not done since 2007. Then he wants to get it growing again.  Duperreault has told investors AIG will break even on underwriting by the start of 2019, which is only a \u201cwaypoint\u201d on a path to richer profits, he told Reuters.  Since taking the helm, Duperreault has hired more than a dozen senior executives and 125 senior underwriters to help execute his vision. Many have previously worked at AIG.  Duperreault's own $43.1 million in 2017 compensation is the largest of any AIG CEO since Greenberg left the company in 2005, according to filings. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/2CnYJPF)  Proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis criticized pay for Duppereault and other executives ahead of AIG\u2019s annual meeting in May, arguing that the company was not performing well enough to lavish tens of millions of dollars upon top executives.  Just 62 percent of voting shareholders signed off on compensation, far below the roughly 90 percent support S&P 500 companies typically receive, according to compensation consulting firm Semler Brossy.  Some analysts say Duperreault\u2019s strategies make sense, but success is far from guaranteed. Last year, AIG reported its lowest revenue and worst loss since the financial crisis, and this year has not been much better.  \u201cI think he can get the process started,\u201d said Sandler O\u2019Neill analyst Paul Newsome. \u201cBut it will take a very, very long time to get it back to what it was before, if that\u2019s even possible.\u201d  AIG shares have lost more than 95 percent of their value since 2007, including 11 percent since Duperreault's hiring. (reut.rs\/2NRx8I0)  Valued at $47.4 billion, AIG is now worth about half of AIA Group Ltd 1299.HK, a former life insurance subsidiary it spun off to reimburse taxpayers, and one-fifth of its peak value of $239 billion in 2000.  EVERY DOLLAR  In response to criticism about compensation, Duperreault said that, in his view, every dollar that goes toward hiring people who can profitably grow revenue is a dollar well spent.  \u201cIf you hire people to make money, that\u2019s probably something you should continue doing,\u201d Duperreault said.  Some on Wall Street welcome his top-tier hirings. \u201cAll of those people left their jobs in high-up positions across the industry to go help Brian fix AIG,\u201d said Wells Fargo analyst Elyse Greenspan.  Before he left AIG in 1994 to head a company himself, Duperreault had spent more than 20 years rising through the ranks under Greenberg\u2019s tutelage.  Duperreault then headed ACE Ltd, transforming it from a niche insurer into a global powerhouse, and in 2008 became CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc MMC.N to reinvigorate the troubled insurance brokerage after it settled a bid-rigging case.  At AIG, Duperreault has also been working to improve relations with regulators.  One of Duperreault\u2019s early challenges was getting AIG off the list of Systemically Important Financial Institutions, or SIFIs, that regulators drew up after the financial crisis.  The company had previously been trying to convince regulators that AIG was no longer a risk to the financial system after selling or winding down some $560 billion in assets and ditching the derivatives business that nearly capsized the company in 2008.  But it was on Duperreault\u2019s watch that the council of top regulators removed AIG\u2019s SIFI shackles last September.  He also had to win over state insurance regulators for his plan to move discontinued business lines to a separate reinsurance unit in Bermuda, a global insurance hub where the unit has favorable requirements for capital it has to set aside.  State regulators were initially concerned about moving those businesses out of their oversight, but after Duperreault spoke to the regulators and created a new executive-level regulatory affairs position, AIG was able to establish the unit, called DSA Re.  \u201cI think we were able to create a level of comfort that this was a well thought-out transaction with a concrete business rationale,\u201d said Thomas Leonardi, a former Connecticut insurance commissioner and investment banker who took up the new role at AIG last year.  Last month, Carlyle Group LP CG.O agreed to buy nearly 20 percent of DSA Re. The investment could spur more deals, analysts said.  Other deals Duperreault has struck include buying Bermuda-based reinsurer Validus Holdings Ltd for $5.56 billion in July, and a UK group life insurance specialist from Munich Re for undisclosed terms in June.  Finding more acquisition targets that meet his criteria has been difficult, Duperreault said.  Duperreault is looking for a company in a large market with a mature legal system that does not cost too much.  \u201cIt\u2019s better to buy than not buy \u2013 but I don\u2019t have to,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is so much profitability to be gained by getting more out of the premiums we currently have.\u201d","115":"(Reuters) - American International Group Inc AIG.N reported a slump in third-quarter profit on Thursday, hurt by losses related to storms, wildfires and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Still, the company\u2019s general insurance unit is on track to enter 2019 \u201cat a slight underwriting profit,\u201d AIG CEO Brian Duperreault said at the Goldman Sachs U.S. Financial Services Conference in New York.  The catastrophe losses do not include December, Duperreault said.  Duperreault, who took charge of AIG in 2017, has vowed to turn the company around. His most critical task is overhauling AIG\u2019s underwriting culture after the company spent years chasing revenue growth without appropriately weighing risks.  The company expects an overall eight percent adjusted return on equity going into 2019, driven in part by the slight underwriting profit in its general insurance unit, Duperreault said.  \u201cBut let me be clear. We are not satisfied with an eight percent,\u201d Duperreault said. The company intends to reach a double-digit adjusted return on equity, but the process could take up to three years, he added.  AIG expects the unit\u2019s 2019 net earned premium to be consistent with 2018 levels, Duperreault said.  Wildfires in California, net of reinsurance, will add between $150 million and $175 million to AIG\u2019s net pretax losses for the fourth quarter, since the company has triggered its reinsurance coverage, Duperreault said. AIG expects its Validus Holdings Ltd unit, the reinsurer it acquired in July, to incur about a $60 million pretax loss for wildfires, he added.  Earnings for AIG\u2019s Life and Retirement will decrease for the second half of 2019, partly related to investment in new business and \u201cgrowth initiatives,\u201d Duperreault said.
