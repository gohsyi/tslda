Federal prosecutors brought criminal conspiracy and wire fraud charges against Sushovan Hussain in 2016, alleging that beginning in 2009, he and others sought to deceive Autonomy\u2019s investors and HP about the company\u2019s financial condition and prospects for growth.  The scheme had several objectives, an indictment said, including to artificially increase and maintain Autonomy\u2019s share price to make the company attractive to potential buyers like HP, which agreed to buy it in 2011 for $11 billion.  Hussain pleaded not guilty, and the trial in San Francisco federal court lasted several weeks.  In a statement, Hussain\u2019s attorney John Keker said defense evidence was excluded from the trial that would have shown HP was not misled at all and that they will appeal the verdict.  \u201cMr. Hussain defrauded no one and acted at all times with the highest standards of honesty, integrity and competence,\u201d Keker said, adding: \u201cIt is a shame that the United States Department of Justice lent its support to HP\u2019s campaign to blame others for its own catastrophic failings.\u201d  The Autonomy deal was supposed to form the central part of HP\u2019s move into software but instead led the U.S. company a year later to write-off three-quarters of Autonomy\u2019s value.  Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co issued a statement on Monday saying it was pleased with the verdict. Hussain misled the market, the company said.  \u201cThat Mr. Hussain attempted to depict the fraud as nothing more than a misunderstanding of international accounting rules was, and still remains, patently ridiculous,\u201d the company said.

British entrepreneur Mike Lynch leaves the High Court in London, Britain March 25, 2019. REUTERS\/Henry Nicholls  HP is suing Lynch, once hailed as Britain\u2019s answer to Bill Gates, along with his former finance chief Sushovan Hussain for more than $5 billion after the 2011 Autonomy deal went disastrously wrong for the Silicon Valley group.  Lynch denies any wrongdoing and says HP\u2019s mismanagement was responsible for the failure of the acquisition. Hussain also denies any wrongdoing.  HP wrote down the value of Autonomy by $8.8 billion, saying it had uncovered serious accounting improprieties. HP is suing Lynch and Hussain for $5 billion of that amount making the case Britain\u2019s biggest-ever fraud trial.  HP\u2019s lawyers told the court when the case opened this week that Autonomy had inflated its true value through a series of fraudulent transactions, such as selling hardware at a loss and so-called round-trip deals - a type of barter with no real commercial rationale - masterminded by Lynch.  In his opening argument for Lynch\u2019s defense, Robert Miles QC said HP had only discovered a small number of historical deals which were said to have some or other wrongful feature, despite spending several years and huge sums of money on its search.  \u201cAll the deals now attacked were real commercial deals with real counterparties. The suggestion that Dr Lynch was in the business of conning HP is unreal,\u201d he told London\u2019s High Court.  \u201cHP, on the other hand, was a vast but floundering company.\u201d  Lynch also faces criminal fraud charges in the United States, which carry a maximum term of 20 years. Hussain has been convicted of fraud in a U.S. case related to the deal.  STRATEGY REVERSAL  A year after acquiring Autonomy, HP threw out Chief Executive Leo Apotheker, the architect of the deal which was supposed to transform the computer and printer maker, one of Silicon Valley\u2019s original companies, into a more profitable group centered on business software and services.  Apotheker was replaced by Meg Whitman, who planned to refocus the company on its core hardware strengths after an outcry from shareholders over the new strategy and a steep decline in HP\u2019s share price.  \u201cAutonomy was left as HP\u2019s unwanted stepchild,\u201d said Miles.  Both Apotheker and Whitman are expected to appear as witnesses in the London trial.  As the case opened on Monday, HP\u2019s lawyer Laurence Rabinowitz QC said the U.S. company had been led to believe it was buying a fast-growing, pure software company.  He told the court that Lynch and Hussain had knowingly been involved in \u201cwidespread and systematic false accounting\u201d to create a materially false picture of Autonomy\u2019s finances.  Autonomy had engaged in \u201crevenue-pumping\u201d by encouraging customers to buy its products in exchange for buying goods from them that it did not need, restructuring deals to produce upfront license fees, and covertly selling pure hardware not even programmed with its software at a loss, Rabinowitz said.  Lynch\u2019s lawyer told the court that it was absurd to think the 53-year-old was making detailed, day-to-day accounting decisions. Rather he relied on a finance department overseen by an audit committee and the company\u2019s auditors, Miles said.  Miles also said it was impossible to understand why Lynch would have taken an executive position at HP after the deal if he really had committed a huge fraud with the U.S. company as its victim.  \u201cThe case that we\u2019re now hearing being advanced entails that Dr Lynch must have been monumentally dim and, as you\u2019ll see, there\u2019s no chance that he is,\u201d Miles said.  Lynch attended the court session but is not expected to be questioned until around July.  Miles also told the court that the $5 billion figure for which Lynch and Hussain are being sued was not based on HP\u2019s own commissioned audits, which had not found a basis for writing down Autonomy in the months after the acquisition.  Hewlett Packard Company in 2015 split into two separate publicly traded companies - HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.  The case is expected to last until the end of the year.","13":"FILE PHOTO: The company logo for Xerox is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 11, 2019.

Xerox and Citigroup did not respond to requests for comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported that Xerox was preparing a bid for HP.  HP shares closed 6.4% higher at $19.57 in New York on Wednesday. Xerox shares rose 3.6% to $37.66, giving the company a market capitalization of $8.3 billion.  Many analysts said there was merit in the companies combining to better cope with a stagnating printing market, but some cited challenges to integration, given their different offerings and pricing models.  \u201cWe would be left to question Xerox\u2019s ability to finance such a large transaction and the potential overlap the two businesses would face,\u201d Wells Fargo analysts wrote in a note.  Xerox had scrapped its $6.1 billion deal to merge with Fujifilm last year under pressure from two major investors, Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, who went on to overthrow its board.  HP has been struggling with its printer business segment recently, with the division\u2019s third-quarter revenue dropping 5% on-year. It has announced a cost-saving program worth more than $1 billion that could result in its shedding about 16% of its workforce, or about 9,000 employees, over the next few years.  This is not the first deal that Icahn has tried to orchestrate by having a small company buy a bigger one. In June, U.S. casino operator Eldorado Resorts Inc agreed to acquire larger peer Caesars Entertainment Corp for $17.3 billion, including debt.  Icahn had earlier gained seats on the board of Caesars.","16":"Jan 8 (Reuters) - HP Inc said on Wednesday that Xerox Holdings Corp securing financing for its $33.5 billion takeover offer for the personal computer maker does not address its key concern of being \u201cundervalued\u201d.  \u201cYour letter dated January 6, 2020 regarding financing does not address the key issue \u2013 that Xerox\u2019s proposal significantly undervalues HP \u2013 and is not a basis for discussion,\u201d the company said in a letter to Xerox.

Xerox made the offer for HP, a company more than three times its size, on Nov. 5, after it resolved a dispute with its joint venture partner Fujifilm Holdings Corp that represented billions of dollars in potential liabilities.  Responding to Xerox\u2019s offer on Sunday, HP said in a statement that it would saddle the combined company with \u201coutsized debt\u201d and was not in the best interest of its shareholders.

Icahn has also amassed a 4% stake in HP.  Xerox had offered HP shareholders $22 per share that included $17 in cash and 0.137 Xerox shares for each HP share, according to the Nov. 5 letter.

Many analysts have said there is merit in the companies combining to better cope with a stagnating printing market, but some cited challenges to integration, given their different offerings and pricing models.  Xerox scrapped its $6.1 billion deal to merge with Fujifilm last year under pressure from Icahn and Deason.  Xerox announced earlier this month it would sell its 25% stake in the joint venture for $2.3 billion. Fujifilm also agreed to drop a lawsuit against Xerox, which it was pursuing following their failed merger.

HP is mindful of large acquisitions given its fateful deal for British software company Autonomy almost a decade ago. HP bought Autonomy for $11.1 billion in 2011 as the centerpiece of its unsuccessful pivot to software.

It has announced a cost-saving program worth more than $1 billion that could result in its shedding about 16% of its workforce, or about 9,000 employees, over the next few years.

However, HP said on Sunday that a decline in Xerox\u2019s revenue since June 2018 from $10.2 billion to $9.2 \u201craises significant questions\u201d regarding the trajectory of Xerox\u2019s business and future prospects.","30":"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday acquitted a former top foreign exchange trader at Barclays Plc accused of illegally trading ahead of an $8 billion transaction for Hewlett-Packard Co, without letting the case go to a jury.  The acquittal of Robert Bogucki, who led Barclays\u2019 foreign exchange trading desk in New York, by U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco sets back federal efforts to hold senior bankers and traders criminally responsible for suspected misconduct.  It also marks a rare instance of such a case being tossed out immediately after the prosecution presented its case at trial, because the evidence was too weak to support a conviction. Bogucki\u2019s trial began on Feb. 21.  A spokesman for U.S. Attorney David Anderson in San Francisco said that office was reviewing Breyer\u2019s decision.  \u201cWe are so very pleased that the court recognized Mr. Bogucki\u2019s innocence and affirmed that the government\u2019s attempt to rewrite the rules years after the fact runs counter to core constitutional principles of due process,\u201d Sean Hecker, a lawyer for Bogucki, said in a statement.  Bogucki was charged with \u201cfront-running\u201d a 2011 transaction involving the sale of 6 billion pounds of cable options linked to HP\u2019s purchase of British software company Autonomy Corp.  Prosecutors accused Bogucki of trying to push down the options\u2019 price, enabling Barclays to profit at HP\u2019s expense.  An indictment quoted Bogucki warning a trader not to let \u201csome loose lipped market monger\u201d tell HP what they were doing, and the trader discussing their plan to \u201cspank the market.\u201d  Breyer, however, said no reasonable jury could find that Bogucki owed HP a duty of trust and confidence.  He also said the relationship between Barclays and HP, industry practice and other factors necessitated an acquittal.  \u201cThe government has pursued a criminal prosecution on the basis of conduct that violated no clear rule or regulation, was not prohibited by the agreements between the parties, and indeed was consistent with the parties\u2019 understanding of the arms-length relationship in which they operated,\u201d Breyer wrote.  \u201cThe court cannot permit this case to go to the jury on such a basis,\u201d he added.  Though such banks as Barclays, Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc have pleaded guilty in connection with foreign exchange markets, few individuals have been held criminally liable.  Last October, a Manhattan federal jury found three former currency traders from Barclays, Citigroup and JPMorgan not guilty of scheming to rig benchmark exchange rates.  The case is U.S. v.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid - RC15DA6446E0\/File Photo  Xerox\u2019s decision came after it said earlier this month it would postpone meetings with HP shareholders to focus on coping with the coronavirus pandemic.  It represents a victory for HP CEO Enrique Lores, who faced a takeover battle as soon as he took over the reins of the Palo Alto, California-based company in November, and a defeat for Xerox CEO John Visentin, a former Hewlett-Packard and IBM Corp executive with ties to the private equity industry who took over as Xerox CEO in 2018.  It is also a blow for billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who owns big stakes in both companies and had pushed for their merger.  Xerox was set to challenge HP\u2019s board at the latter\u2019s annual meeting of shareholders in May, but will now abandon this effort as well as its tender offer for HP\u2019s shares, the company said in a statement.  \u201cWhile it is disappointing to take this step, we are prioritizing the health, safety and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and other stakeholders, and our broader response to the pandemic, over and above all other considerations,\u201d Xerox said.  Xerox added that there were compelling long-term financial and strategic benefits in a potential combination with HP. While it is possible that the companies will choose to engage once the coronavirus crisis subsides, Xerox\u2019s decision means that it will not get another chance to put such pressure on HP until its next annual shareholder meeting in spring 2021.  The banks financing Xerox\u2019s takeover bid \u201cnever wavered in their commitments\u201d despite the market turmoil fueled by the coronavirus outbreak, the Norwalk, Connecticut-based company said.  \u201cHP would like to thank our shareholders, partners, customers and employees for their input and continued support through this process,\u201d HP said in a statement.  The market rout triggered by the global coronavirus outbreak has led many companies to hit the pause button on mergers and acquisitions, sabotaging the hopes of corporate advisers who expected a dealmaking bonanza this year.  Both Xerox and HP have seen their business suffer in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, though HP\u2019s stock has proved more resilient, as employees working for home to protect themselves from the virus boosted revenue for its PCs and other office equipment. Xerox shares have lost more than half their value in the last five weeks, while HP shares are down about a quarter.  PRINTING IN DECLINE  The printing industry is in decline as companies and consumers turn to digital documents to save money and help the environment. This has put pressure on companies in the sector to consolidate and reverse their revenue decline through acquisitions that can boost their market share.  HP, which separated from servers and networking equipment provider Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Inc in 2015, has participated in this consolidation, acquiring Samsung Electronics Co Ltd\u2019s printer business for $1.05 billion in 2017.  Nevertheless, HP had been reluctant to engage in deal discussions with Xerox since November, when the latter launched its takeover campaign after reaching a settlement with Fujifilm Holdings Corp that resolved a legal dispute over their 57-year-old joint venture and a previous attempt to merge, yielding a $2.3 billion after-tax payoff for Xerox.  HP said that Xerox\u2019s offer undervalued it and disputed the $2 billion value of potential cost synergies that Xerox put forward in a possible combination. It argued that its sale to Xerox would saddle the combined company with too much debt, and also raised questions on the impact on Xerox\u2019s supply chain of losing Fujifilm as a partner.  HP engaged in deal talks with Xerox last year at the invitation of Icahn, a top Xerox shareholder who has since also acquired a stake in HP. These talks stalled after the companies failed to agree on the amount of confidential information they shared with each other.  HP relies on its desktop and notebook PCs business for the majority of its net revenue but gets the bulk of its earnings from its printing hardware and supplies division.","37":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - HP Inc HPQ.N reiterated on Sunday its rejection of Xerox Corp's XRX.N $33.5 billion cash-and-stock offer for the company, adding that the proposal \"significantly undervalues HP.\"  The personal computer maker said last Sunday it rebuffed Xerox\u2019s offer, and that it was open to exploring its own bid for the U.S. printer maker.

HP is pursuing Lynch and his former colleague Sushovan Hussain for $5 billion in London\u2019s High Court.  Lynch, who has counter sued, has denied the charge, saying that Autonomy\u2019s value was damaged by mismanagement by HP.

The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said the complaints against auditors Deloitte and the executives would now be handled by its Tribunal, which can levy unlimited fines on individuals and institutions, and exclude individuals from the profession or from certain work until they show improvement.  Thursday\u2019s move comes a month after Autonomy\u2019s former chief financial officer Sushovan Hussain was convicted by a U.S. jury of wire fraud and other crimes related to claims that he inflated the firm\u2019s value before its sale.  HP bought Autonomy to spearhead a shift into software, but the deal soured a year later when it wrote off three-quarters of Autonomy\u2019s value, alleging it was deceived about Autonomy\u2019s finances and prospects for growth. The two sides have been locked in an acrimonious battle ever since.  The FRC, which was investigating the numbers reported by Autonomy, said the conduct of auditors Deloitte; Deloitte partners Richard Knights and Nigel Mercer; former Autonomy finance chief Sushovan Hussain and former Autonomy vice president of finance Stephen Chamberlain, had fallen significantly short of standards.  Hussain and Chamberlain were alleged to have acted dishonestly and\/or recklessly, including when preparing the company\u2019s accounts for 2009 and 2010, the FRC said.  HP has claimed Autonomy\u2019s management fraudulently booked revenue and engineered sham sales to some resellers to inflate the company\u2019s value.  Autonomy\u2019s former management, including its chief executive Michael Lynch, have denied the allegations. Hussain\u2019s lawyer said after his conviction that his client would appeal.  VINDICATION  Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), which HP\u2019s software and enterprise business became after the company was split in 2015, said the FRC\u2019s complaints endorsed its position.  \u201cWe believe the actions of the FRC further vindicate HPE\u2019s position that HP was a victim of financial fraud by former Autonomy management,\u201d a spokesman said on Friday.  The FRC said its inquiry had been in parallel with criminal and civil investigations in both the United States and Britain.  It said Autonomy\u2019s auditors had failed to challenge the company\u2019s accounting and disclosure of purchases and sales of computer hardware and its transactions with resellers.  It also said Knights had failed to correct a misleading statement made by Hussain, and had failed to act with objectivity for a period between 2009 and 2010.  Deloitte UK said it acknowledged Thursday\u2019s announcement from the FRC and had fully cooperated with the investigation.  \u201cWe are disappointed that these complaints have been brought and we will defend ourselves against them at Tribunal,\u201d a Deloitte spokesman said, adding that he was also speaking on behalf of Knights and Mercer.  Knights still works at Deloitte, but is not doing statutory audit work, while Mercer has retired, the spokesman said.  A Tribunal hearing date will be announced in due course.","44":"(Reuters) - HP Inc HPQ.N reported better-than-expected quarterly results and raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast on Thursday, as it benefits from strong growth in its personal systems business and its acquisition of Samsung's printer business.

The acquittal of Robert Bogucki, who led Barclays\u2019 foreign exchange trading desk in New York, by U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco sets back federal efforts to hold senior bankers and traders criminally responsible for suspected misconduct.  It also marks a rare instance of such a case being tossed out immediately after the prosecution presented its case at trial, because the evidence was too weak to support a conviction. Bogucki\u2019s trial began on Feb. 21.  A spokesman for U.S. Attorney David Anderson in San Francisco said that office was reviewing Breyer\u2019s decision.  Sean Hecker, a lawyer for Bogucki, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Bogucki was charged with \u201cfront-running\u201d a 2011 transaction involving the sale of 6 billion pounds of cable options linked to HP\u2019s purchase of British software company Autonomy Corp.  Prosecutors accused Bogucki of trying to push down the options\u2019 price, enabling Barclays to profit at HP\u2019s expense.  An indictment quoted Bogucki warning a trader not to let \u201csome loose lipped market monger\u201d tell HP what they were doing, and the trader discussing their plan to \u201cspank the market.\u201d  Breyer, however, said no reasonable jury could find that Bogucki owed HP a duty of trust and confidence.  He also said the relationship between Barclays and HP, industry practice and other factors necessitated an acquittal.  \u201cThe government has pursued a criminal prosecution on the basis of conduct that violated no clear rule or regulation, was not prohibited by the agreements between the parties, and indeed was consistent with the parties\u2019 understanding of the arms-length relationship in which they operated,\u201d Breyer wrote.  \u201cThe court cannot permit this case to go to the jury on such a basis,\u201d he added.  Though such banks as Barclays, Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc have pleaded guilty in connection with foreign exchange markets, few individuals have been held criminally liable.  Last October, a Manhattan federal jury found three former currency traders from Barclays, Citigroup and JPMorgan not guilty of scheming to rig benchmark exchange rates.  Meanwhile, former HSBC Holdings Plc head of foreign exchange cash trading Mark Johnson is appealing his conviction and two-year prison term for defrauding a client on a currency trade.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  HP adopted a \u201cpoison pill\u201d last month to neutralize Xerox\u2019s tender offer. Unless the companies can reach a compromise, it will be Xerox\u2019s bid to replace HP\u2019s board of directors at the latter\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in the next few weeks, rather than the tender offer, that will determine the outcome of the takeover battle.  The printing industry is in decline as companies and consumers turn to digital documents to save money and help the environment. This has put pressure on companies in the sector to consolidate and reverse revenue decline through acquisitions that can boost market share.  However, after almost a year of on and off talks, HP and Xerox have been unable to avoid a confrontation.  HP accuses Xerox of refusing to provide it with enough information that would allow it to make an offer for Xerox. Xerox has said HP does not want to pursue a combination and that its bid for HP is the best way to combine the two companies and deliver a premium to HP shareholders.  Complicating the talks is billionaire investor Carl Icahn, a top Xerox shareholder who last year also acquired a stake in HP, and has been pushing the companies to combine under the leadership of Xerox CEO John Visentin.  Xerox\u2019s account of their talks published on Monday also differed in some key points from a version that HP reported to its shareholders last week.  For example, HP said last week that Xerox refused to address its questions about the trajectory of Xerox\u2019s business during their negotiations last year. Xerox, on the other hand, said on Monday that few, if any, questions that HP raised were about the revenue trajectory.  In another instance, HP said Visentin told its former CEO Dion Weisler that the debt an acquisition of HP would saddle Xerox with made it preferable for HP to buy Xerox. Xerox, however, said in its disclosures Visentin told Weisler that an acquisition of HP would be highly accretive for Xerox shareholders, despite the fact that a transaction in the opposite direction would be more straightforward.  Xerox, whose $7 billion market capitalization is one quarter the size of HP\u2019s, has said it expects a combination to yield approximately $2 billion in cost synergies, though HP has said this figure is too high. The two companies focus on complementary segments of the printing market.","50":"March 23 (Reuters) - Hp Inc:  * HP INC.

The U.S. executive was giving testimony in the $5 billion trial of Mike Lynch, whom HP accuses, along with his former colleague Sushovan Hussain, of inflating the value of the big data firm before selling it to HP in 2011 for $11.1 billion.  Lynch has denied the allegations and said the failure of the acquisition was down to HP\u2019s mismanagement and neglect of the company during Whitman\u2019s tenure.  Apotheker, the architect of the deal, was fired by HP\u2019s board just weeks after it was announced as part of a huge shake-up which also included the possible sale of its PC business.  Whitman, a non-executive director on the board, said she had to be persuaded to take the job of CEO.

She told the court that her priority was stabilising the core business - which was in a more precarious state than she had feared - and reassuring customers and investors that the company was not going to ditch hardware completely.  But she denied that Autonomy was neglected. \u201cWe really wanted Autonomy to be successful,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were committed to Autonomy but we had to stabilise the core assets.\u201d  She said Lynch, who reported directly to her, received more of her attention in fixing problems than almost anyone else.

He argues that HP itself, a \u201cvast but floundering company\u201d, botched the acquisition.  Autonomy was a market leader in software for unstructured data, helping companies extract the meaning from emails, video or voice calls, which are hard to analyze in traditional ways.  And Leo Apotheker, architect of the deal and HP\u2019s CEO between November 2010 and September 2011, had sought to boost HP\u2019s languishing profitability by integrating its legacy computer and printer business with higher-margin software.  But the former CEO of Europe\u2019s leading business software group SAP resisted suggestions from Lynch\u2019s defense lawyer in London\u2019s High Court that the acquisition of Autonomy was central to a desperate strategy.  \u201cUnstructured data was at the center of your plans,\u201d Robert Miles QC, acting for Lynch, told Apotheker, who was called as a witness in the case.  \u201cNo, that\u2019s not right, it was part of the plan,\u201d Apotheker said, adding that HP had considered buying either Autonomy or German group Software AG in the first half of 2011, but decided on the British firm because it would provide the \u201ctechnological uplift\u201d that HP wanted.  It was not clear cut, Apotheker said:  \u201cLooking at financial markets, investors, I think they would have preferred Software AG,\u201d he said.  Apotheker who said in his witness statement that he had \u201cnever told the due diligence team to prioritize due diligence of Autonomy\u2019s technology over its financials\u201d, also rejected the idea that HP was in crisis.  \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t doing well.

Bets of interest rate cuts by the Fed have surged this week after a dramatic contraction in U.S. manufacturing, cooling private sector hiring and a fall in service sector activity evidenced the fallout from a prolonged U.S.-China trade war.  Traders currently see a 77.5% chance for the central bank to lower borrowing costs at its policy meeting later this month, up from 40% on Monday.  The Fed cut rates in September for the second time this year and said future reductions would be \u201cdata-dependent\u201d.  The S&P had gapped lower on Wednesday after bleak manufacturing data, but Friday\u2019s gains have helped the index climb back to near its Tuesday close.  The benchmark index is now 3% away from its record high hit in July after coming within striking distance of it two weeks ago.  Apple Inc shares rose 2.4% after a report that the company would ramp up production of iPhone 11 models.  The broader technology sector was up 1.26%, rising the most among 11 major S&P sectors. The Philadelphia chip index advanced 1.18%.  At 12:59 p.m. ET (1659 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 235.82 points, or 0.90%, at 26,436.86 and the S&P 500 was up 26.80 points, or 0.92%, at 2,937.43. The Nasdaq Composite was up 73.81 points, or 0.94%, at 7,946.08.  HP Inc tumbled 9.2% after the PC maker said it would cut up to 16% of its workforce as part of a restructuring plan that would result in an overall charge of $1 billion.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.12-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and 1.59-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.  The S&P index recorded 13 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 13 new highs and 57 new lows.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  (Reuters) - Xerox Holdings Corp XRX.N on Tuesday posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit as it kept a tight lid on costs and said it plans to follow through with its $33 billion bid to buy rival HP Inc HPQ.N.  Shares of the company, known for its photocopiers and printers, were up as much as 7%.  Xerox, which has been facing a slowdown in demand as businesses cut down on printing their paperwork, has laid out a three-year cost-cutting plan under Chief Executive Officer John Visentin, a nominee of activist investor Carl Icahn.  In the fourth quarter, Xerox cut expenses by $266 million and said it expects to save another $450 million in 2020. The quarterly results also benefited from a gain of over $500 million related to the sale of stake in Fuji Xerox and other assets.  That helped the company increase its net income to $818 million, or $3.61 per share, from $137 million, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.33 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.11.  Xerox\u2019s total revenue fell to $2.44 billion in the fourth quarter from $2.50 billion a year earlier.  Xerox in November launched a bid for HP to drive consolidation in a shrinking market. After getting rebuffed, Xerox has started a proxy fight to take over the board of its target.  Icahn, who owned stakes in both companies, favors a merger between the two companies."}}
