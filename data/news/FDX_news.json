Amazon is running \u201cShipping with Amazon\u201d in Los Angeles and possibly other locations, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on condition of anonymity.  News of the test sparked investor concern that the world's largest online retailer would upend the shipping market. FedEx Corp FDX.N and United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N shares were down more than 4 percent in afternoon trading.  FedEx, UPS and analysts played down the idea that a trial poses a near-term threat to the couriers\u2019 businesses.  Cowen and Co analyst Helane Becker estimated Amazon would have to invest $100 billion to build a global network of facilities, planes and trucks to compete with FedEx and UPS.  See a graphic unpacking Amazon and the 'Prime economy' here: reut.rs\/2EfyCqy  The program, while still at an early stage, aims to reduce hurdles that some sellers face getting their inventory to Amazon\u2019s facilities.  Under the new process being tested, Amazon sends a truck to pick up sellers\u2019 products, which then takes inventory either directly to an Amazon fulfillment center or to the U.S. Postal Service or to couriers like FedEx, depending on what\u2019s most cost-effective, said the person who spoke to Reuters.  Amazon has run a number of experiments in Los Angeles because the city is spread out and is a big market for deliveries. \u201cShipping with Amazon\u201d is currently intended for select third-party sellers in the test, not for businesses in general, and still it is not yet ready to roll out widely to sellers on Amazon, said the person.  FedEx and UPS customers should not expect to shift their business to Amazon any time soon. The Seattle-based company has considered taking work from the couriers on a conceptual level but does not have initiatives currently planned to ramp up competition, the person said.  Amazon said on Friday it was \u201calways innovating and experimenting on behalf of customers and the businesses that sell and grow on Amazon to create faster lower-cost delivery choices.\u201d  UPS and FedEx have both spent billions of dollars in recent years to upgrade and expand their networks to handle soaring e-commerce volumes. UPS said last week it plans to spend $7 billion on upgrading its network this year alone.  UPS and FedEx also consider Amazon an important customer. Amazon accounts for less than 10 percent of total revenue for UPS and 4 percent of revenue for FedEx, according to Wolfe Research analyst Scott Group.  UPS and FedEx declined to comment on Amazon\u2019s specific strategies or decisions regarding the utilization of their services.  \u201cThere is tremendous opportunity in the business-to-customer market and more growth coming to the sector and UPS, irrespective of how other companies shift strategies,\u201d UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara said.  An earlier report on Amazon\u2019s plan \u201cdemonstrates a lack of basic understanding of the full scale of the global transportation industry,\u201d FedEx spokesman Patrick Fitzgerald said.","1":"* Indexes set their sixth straight session of gains  * FedEx tumbles 10% after cutting profit forecast  * Trump impeachment vote in focus  * S&P 500 hits its fifth consecutive all-time high  * Indexes: Dow flat, S&P up 0.1%, Nasdaq gains 0.2% (For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window.)  Dec 18 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 inched to an all-time high on Wednesday, extending a record-setting run as optimism about global economic growth strengthens, limited somewhat by a steep drop in FedEx shares.  The Nasdaq also hit a record high. All three major indexes were on pace for their sixth straight session of gains, building on a rally from late last week spurred by expectations of an initial U.S.-China trade deal.  Analysts said the trade agreement, announced on Friday, removed a major risk for global equity markets, leaving stocks with slightly more room to rise in what is left of 2019.  \u201cThe trade truce with China has really set the backdrop for a continued move higher to the end of the year,\u201d said Chris Zaccarelli, Chief Investment Officer, Independent Advisor Alliance, Charlotte, North Carolina.  \u201cI don\u2019t see a huge rally, just a slow drip.\u201d  The benchmark S&P 500 hit its fifth consecutive record high on Wednesday, its longest streak since January 2018.  However, holding back gains on the index was a 10% drop in FedEx shares after the U.S. parcel delivery company cut its fiscal 2020 profit forecast on heavy expenses, slowing global trade and the fallout from its breakup with Amazon.com Inc.  The profit warning from FedEx pressured shares of rival United Parcel Service Inc, with the Dow Jones Transport Average down 0.9%.  The market also largely shrugged off the near certain impeachment of Donald Trump as the House of Representatives gears up for a historic vote later in the day on two charges accusing the U.S. President of abusing his power and obstructing Congress.  Trading history during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton and the resignation of President Richard Nixon suggests Wall Street has little to worry about.  Facebook Inc was the biggest boost to the S&P 500 as Deutsche Bank raised its price target on the stock.  At 1:10 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 10.03 points, or 0.04%, at 28,277.19, the S&P 500 was up 2.55 points, or 0.08%, at 3,195.07 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 20.52 points, or 0.23%, at 8,843.88.  Small cap Russell 2000 hit its highest level in 14 months on Wednesday.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.39-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.04-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.  The S&P index recorded 34 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 125 new highs and 41 new lows.","2":"People visit a FedEx Express booth during the China International Import Expo (CIIE) at the National Exhibition and Convention Center in Shanghai, China November 7, 2018.

A FedEx truck is held from entering the scene of a blast at a FedEx facility in Schertz, Texas, U.S., March 20, 2018. REUTERS\/Sergio Flores  The package delivery company will also X-ray entire truckloads of parcels at its sorting facility outside Austin, and then divert them elsewhere for sorting and delivery, said the FedEx employee who was not authorized to speak on the record. The source does not work at the sorting facility but was briefed on the situation.  FedEx spokesman Jim McCluskey said he had no immediate comment.  The blast at FedEx on Tuesday was one of five explosions in Texas in the past 18 days. A sixth explosion on Tuesday night did not appear related, authorities said. The five attacks have killed two people, injured others and left hundreds of federal and local investigators scrambling to find the perpetrator and a motive.  Package screening is not routine at the nation\u2019s big delivery companies such as FedEx, United Parcel Service Inc or the U.S. Postal Service. The industry delivers a total of around 40 million parcels in the United States each day, industry experts said. Checking every package on a regular basis would virtually paralyze their operations.  FedEx will carry out the special screenings at the sorting facility in Schertz, Texas where the package exploded, injuring one worker, and at a second location in Austin, where another explosive device was found, the employee said. The second package was turned over to police.  \u201cFedEx in conjunction with the authorities are field X-raying all the packages one at a time,\u201d the employee said. \u201cFrom then on, we will be doing bulk X-rays of entire trailers.\u201d  Packages will likely be delayed by a day or two at the facility, and FedEx was re-routing all other packages to its hub in Houston to avoid further delays, he said.  FedEx has provided law enforcement with \u201cextensive evidence from our advanced technology security systems designed to protect the safety of our teammates, our customers and the communities we serve,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith told analysts on Tuesday after the company reported quarterly financial results.  FedEx will provide authorities with the location where the package was picked up by the driver and the time, the employee said, providing authorities with a wealth of data.  Satish Jindel, a founder of the delivery company that became FedEx Ground and now serves as president of ShipMatrix, which tracks on-time shipments, said it was highly unlikely that the industry would move toward routine screening. Package bombs are rare, he said, making it unrealistic to check every package, every day, considering the enormous cost.  \u201cThey don\u2019t, they can\u2019t, and they shouldn\u2019t, and it would be unreasonable and ignorant for this country and for people to expect it,\u201d Jindel said. \u201cIt would shut the economy down.\u201d  For now, the industry will likely rely on employees who are trained to flag suspicious packages, Jindel said.  UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara said the world\u2019s largest package delivery company has security measures in place and was cooperating with law enforcement in their investigation, but declined to comment further.  DHL Worldwide Express said it had \u201cstandard\u201d security and screening procedures in place and that its security teams were monitoring the situation in Texas.  The U.S. Postal Service uses technology, targeted screening and employee training to stop suspicious packages, spokesman Dave Partenheimer said.  The FedEx manager with knowledge of the incident said the blast appeared to have been set off by a mechanical arm that diverts packages along a conveyer belt. When the arm came out and hit the package, it exploded on the sorter just as it entered a chute, he said.  \u201cThe good thing is it went off when it was going down the chute,\u201d he said. \u201cThe chute actually shielded anybody below from the blast.\u201d","5":"April 30 (Reuters) - FedEx Corp:  * JOHN A.

FedEx and rival United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N are considered bellwethers for the U.S. economy and global trade. Investors are monitoring their operations for any disruptions caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's ongoing tariff battles with China and other nations.  Trade between the United States and China accounts for roughly 2 percent of total FedEx revenue. Tariffs implemented so far affect less than 10 percent of company volume, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Rajesh Subramaniam said on a conference call.  Economic activity in China is starting to moderate as Trump weighs tariffs on another $200 billon in Chinese imports, he said.  \u201cThe administration\u2019s announcement is worrisome to everyone,\u201d FedEx Chief Executive Frederick Smith said as the market waited for Trump\u2019s promised decision on the new tariffs on Monday.  Volume increases and other factors pushed FedEx net profit up 40 percent to $835 million, or $3.10 per share, for the fiscal first quarter ended Aug. 31. But that was not enough to satisfy Wall Street, which was looking for an adjusted profit that was 35 cents above the $3.46 per share that FedEx reported.  FedEx accelerated the timing of $200 million in annual pay increases this year, following the passage of Trump\u2019s U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That move contributed to compensation-related charges and other items that shaved profits by 48 cents per share in the latest quarter.  \u201cWe remain committed to increasing earnings, margins, cash flows and returns this year,\u201d FedEx Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf said in a statement.  To that end, FedEx increased its adjusted earnings forecast to $17.20 to $17.80 per share from a prior range of $17 to $17.60.  FedEx, UPS and the U.S. Post office are preparing for what is expected to be another record holiday package delivery season.  FedEx invested billions of dollars in capacity-boosting network upgrades \u201cthat will give them a buffer going into the next peak,\u201d Edward Jones analyst Dan Sherman said.  FedEx also is boosting seasonal hiring about 10 percent to 55,000 workers; adding year-round Saturday delivery; and bringing back Sunday holiday season deliveries as Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O ramps up the pressure on shippers.","7":"AUSTIN\/SCHERTZ, Texas (Reuters) - A parcel packed with nails and shrapnel blew up on Tuesday at a FedEx Corp center near San Antonio, Texas, injuring a worker, before a second booby-trapped package was intercepted in Austin - the latest in a chain of bombings that have killed two people.  The two FedEx bomb incidents hours apart on Tuesday morning brought to six the number of explosive devices - five of them detonated - that have come under investigation in Texas this month as the work of a suspected serial bomber.  Baffled investigators have taken the extraordinary step of issuing public appeals through the media asking that whoever is responsible to at least come forward with a demand or an explanation.  Adding to tensions, police and federal agents said that a third package they described as an \u201cincendiary device\u201d went off Tuesday evening in Austin, the Texas capital, injuring a man there.  But police and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) said they had no reason to believe that incident, reported to have occurred at a thrift shop for the charity Goodwill Industries, was related to any of the others or the act of a \u201ccopy cat.\u201d  All but one of incidents have occurred in Austin. The exception came early on Tuesday when a package filled with nails and metal shrapnel exploded at about 12:30 a.m. on a conveyer belt at FedEx distribution center near San Antonio, knocking a female employee off her feet, officials said.  The package was being sent from Austin to another address in the city and passed through a sorting facility in the town of Schertz, about 65 miles (105 km) away. Authorities said the worker was treated for her injuries at the scene.  Later in the morning, authorities were alerted to a suspicious package at a separate FedEx facility in Austin. Police and federal agents called to the scene found the package contained a bomb and it \u201cwas disrupted by law enforcement,\u201d according to a joint statement from Austin police, the ATF and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  No injuries were reported, the statement said.  Slideshow ( 19 images )  The three agencies said investigators had determined that the two FedEx bombs \u201care connected\u201d to the four other bomb blasts that occurred between March 2 and March 18 in Austin, killing two people and injuring four others.  But ATF and police said the incident Tuesday evening in south Austin \u201cdoes not appear to be related\u201d to the previous bombings. Local emergency services officials said the victim, a man in his 30, was treated for minor burns and released.  Slideshow ( 19 images )  A FedEx manager told Reuters the company would begin conducting special safety screenings of packages at its facilities in Schertz and Austin where Tuesday\u2019s incidents occurred.  Speaking through the media, officials have appealed to the bomber to reveal the motives for the attacks and have asked the public for any tips, offering a $115,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.  \u201cSomebody has to know something,\u201d FBI spokeswoman Christina Garza said. \u201cThe person behind these explosives, please, we want to know why.\u201d  \u201cThis is obviously a very, very sick individual, or maybe individuals,\u201d President Donald Trump told reporters. \u201cThese are sick people, and we will get to the bottom of it.\u201d  The four previous explosions killed two people and injured four others, unnerving residents of Austin, a city of some 1 million people. The first bombings occurred as the state capital was hosting the annual South By Southwest music, film and technology festival  The first three devices were parcel bombs dropped off in front of homes in different Austin neighborhoods. The fourth went off on Sunday night on the west side of the city and was described by police as a more sophisticated device detonated through a trip wire.","8":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window.)  * Fed policy decision expected at 2:00 p.m. ET  * FedEx tumbles after profit warning; drags down UPS shares  * Adobe down after tepid revenue forecast  * Indexes down: Dow 0.21%, S&P 0.27%, Nasdaq 0.39% (Updates to early afternoon)  Sept 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks came under pressure on Wednesday as investors waited for the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on interest rates and clues about its future monetary policy, while a profit warning by FedEx weighed on sentiment.  The package delivery company\u2019s shares tumbled 13.6% and were on course for their sharpest one-day percentage drop since the financial crisis after FedEx blamed U.S.-China trade tensions and a split with Amazon.com Inc for its dismal full-year profit forecast.  Its stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 index and drove a 1.7% drop in shares of rival United Parcel Service Inc.  The Dow Jones Transport Average lost 1.71%, while the broader industrial sector was off 0.65%. Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors were in the red.  Investors are now squarely focused on the U.S. central bank\u2019s policy statement due at 2:00 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), followed by Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s address a half hour later.  The Fed is expected to lower interest rates by a quarter percentage point for the second time in three months, but a deep divide among policymakers has led traders to abandon all bets on a third reduction this year.  \u201cI expect them to give a tone of \u2018we\u2019ll let the number tell us what to do next\u2019 as they have in the past,\u201d said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.  \u201cEspecially, with three of the Fed board members last time not voting for the rate cut, you may see even more cautious language going forward.\u201d  Earlier in the day, the central bank injected more cash into the banking system as the key interest rate pierced above its targeted range for the first time since the financial crisis. That puts pressure on policymakers to come up with long-term fixes for the funding squeeze.  In response, trader bets for a 25 basis point reduction in interest rates shot back up to 72.7% after falling to nearly 50% on Tuesday, according to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool.  The interest-rate sensitive banking index edged 0.10% lower and was on pace for a third day of losses.  Expectations of lower rates have spurred a Wall Street rally this year, with the benchmark S&P 500 now less than 1% below its all-time high hit in July.  At 12:37 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 55.89 points, or 0.21%, at 27,054.91, the S&P 500 was down 8.08 points, or 0.27%, at 2,997.62. The Nasdaq Composite was down 31.90 points, or 0.39%, at 8,154.12.  Adobe Inc slipped 2.8% after the Photoshop software maker forecast tepid revenue for the current quarter.  In a bright spot, Versace-owner Capri Holdings Ltd rose 1.9% as Jefferies raised its price target on the stock.

Therefore UPS, FedEx and other private parties cannot technically be involved in shipping ballots,\u201d UPS told Reuters in a statement.  \u201cFedEx does accept individual ballots, and we advise that customers planning to return their ballots via FedEx should closely review their state\u2019s guidelines on absentee voting and deadlines for ballots or related election documents,\u201d FedEx said.  Republican President Donald Trump on Thursday said he opposed providing funds for the struggling Postal Service for mail voting, which is expected to surge to 50% as the coronavirus pandemic rages ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election.  The Postal Service said on Friday it has written to 46 states and the District of Columbia warning there is a significant risk voters will not have enough time to complete and return their ballots.  In a viral Twitter post here on Thursday, author and radio host David Rothkopf said there was a \"big opportunity\" for UPS and FedEx to deliver ballots for free. \"You'll overnight become the most beloved and respected organization in America,\" he wrote.  Various laws and regulations for the most part prohibit private delivery companies from handling mail-in and absentee ballots, the companies and experts told Reuters. Exceptions include deliveries deemed \u201cextremely urgent\u201d by statute and deliveries on the day of and afternoon prior to election day.  In some states, collection would be prohibited because it would be considered \u201cballot harvesting,\u201d said Tammy Patrick, a former Arizona election official and senior advisor to the Democracy Fund foundation.  There are other hurdles that those companies, already coping with a pandemic-related surge in e-commerce shipments, would have to overcome.  For example, the Postal Service touches every U.S. mailbox six days a week. Private companies visit only when they have a delivery or an pre-arranged pickup - and they do not have blanket coverage in rural areas.  Amazon.com\u2019s upstart delivery service has also been floated as an alternative. That service does not do residential pickups.  Representatives from Amazon and the Postal Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  \u201cEstablishing a protocol of how they would collect the ballots would be a challenge,\u201d Patrick said.  Domestic costs would skyrocket since delivery firms charge significantly more for deliveries than the price of a 55-cent stamp, which is the cost to return many ballots.  And, international costs would be \u201castronomical,\u201d Patrick said.","15":"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei is reviewing its relationship with FedEx Corp after it claimed the U.S. package delivery company, without detailed explanation, diverted two parcels destined for Huawei addresses in Asia to the United States and attempted to reroute two others.  Huawei told Reuters on Friday that FedEx diverted two packages sent from Japan and addressed to Huawei in China to the United States, and attempted to divert two more packages sent from Vietnam to Huawei offices elsewhere in Asia, all without authorization, providing images of FedEx tracking records.  Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the records. Shown the images of the tracking records, FedEx declined to make any comment, saying company policy prevented it from disclosing customer information.  Huawei said the four packages only contained documents and \u201cno technology,\u201d which Reuters was unable to independently confirm.  Huawei declined to elaborate on why it thought the packages were diverted.  \u201cThe recent experiences where important commercial documents sent via FedEx were not delivered to their destination, and instead were either diverted to, or were requested to be diverted to, FedEx in the United States, undermines our confidence,\u201d Joe Kelly, a spokesman for Huawei, told Reuters.  \u201cWe will now have to review our logistics and document delivery support requirements as a direct result of these incidents,\u201d the spokesman said.  Huawei acknowledged to Reuters that one package originating in Vietnam was received by Friday, and the other was on its way, according to FedEx tracking records provided by Huawei.  FedEx spokeswoman Maury Donahue told Reuters the packages were \u201cmisrouted in error\u201d. She acknowledged in an earlier statement that the U.S. Department of Commerce had recently added Chinese companies and affiliates to its \u201cEntity List\u201d, but did not elaborate.  FedEx was not requested to divert the packages by any other party, she added.  \u201cThis is an isolated issue limited to a very small number of packages,\u201d said FedEx, referring to the four parcels affected. \u201cWe are aware of all shipments at issue and are working directly with our customers to return the packages to their possession.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: A Huawei company logo is seen at the security exhibition in Shanghai, China May 24, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  FedEx China on Tuesday apologized on its Chinese social media account for the \u201cmishandling\u201d of Huawei packages and confirmed there was no \u201cexternal pressure\u201d to divert packages.  The U.S. Department of Commerce did not reply to a request for comment on whether the incident might be related to its move on May 16 to add Huawei to the so-called \u201cEntity List,\u201d preventing it buying certain items from U.S. companies without U.S. government approval.  FORMAL COMPLAINT  The United States believes Huawei, the world\u2019s largest telecom network gear maker leading the way in creating the next generation of wireless networks known as 5G, is a potential espionage threat because of its close ties with the Chinese government.  Huawei has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services.  The issue has become a flashpoint in an escalating trade battle between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.  The two packages sent on May 19 and May 20 from Tokyo, intended for Huawei in China, ended up in Memphis, Tennessee, the headquarters of the U.S. company, by May 23, according to images of FedEx tracking records shown to Reuters by Huawei.  The two packages originating from Hanoi on May 17, destined for Huawei\u2019s Hong Kong and Singapore offices, were held up after arriving in local FedEx stations in Hong Kong and Singapore on May 21 for \u201cdelivery exception,\u201d according to other images Huawei showed Reuters.  According to FedEx\u2019s website, the status \u201cexception\u201d means an unexpected event is preventing delivery of a package, for example a customs delay, a holiday, or no one being available to accept delivery. FedEx declined to give details on what the exception was in this case.  According to Huawei, a FedEx customer service representative in Vietnam replied to their inquiry on May 22 when two expected packages did not arrive on time, saying: \u201cPlease be informed that FDX SG received notification from FDX US to hold and return the package to US. Hence, the shipment is not deliver to consignee and now being hold at FDX station and under process to RTS it (return to sender),\u201d the representative wrote in broken English, according to an email Huawei showed to Reuters.  Huawei told Reuters that both Vietnam packages were sent by its shipping agent, a contractor to Huawei whom it did not identify, and contained urgent documents. It said the shipping agent refused permission for FedEx to send the packages to the United States and instructed they be returned, Huawei told Reuters. Reuters could not confirm that.  Huawei told Reuters it only learned that the Japan-originated packages, which were sent by suppliers that it did not identify, had been diverted to the United States after checking FedEx\u2019s tracking record.  The company said it has lodged a formal complaint with China\u2019s postal regulator, which it said is investigating the incident. China\u2019s State Postal Bureau did not return a request for comment.","16":"FedEx delivery trucks are pictured in Pasadena, California U.S., March 21, 2017.

A package containing a Huawei phone sent to the United States was returned last week to its sender in Britain, in what FedEx said was an \u201coperational error.\u201d  Chinese telecoms company Huawei Technologies Co in May was added to a blacklist of people and companies the U.S. government said posed a security risk, barring it from buying, without special approval, U.S. technology upon which it was heavily reliant. A number of other Chinese firms have also been banned from buying sensitive U.S. technology.  In its lawsuit, FedEx said it should not be expected to enforce the export ban, and could not reasonably be held liable for shipping products that it did not know about.  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement that the regulation stated that carriers must not knowingly ship items in contravention of the rules. \u201cIt does not require a common carrier to be a policeman or to know what\u2019s in every package,\u201d he said.  UPS said in Tuesday\u2019s statement it would continue to follow government directives across the markets where it operates.  Last month, China said it would launch an investigation after two parcels sent via FedEx destined for Huawei addresses in Asia were diverted to the United States. FedEx said the packages were \u201cmisrouted in error.\u201d  In the latest incident, technology news outlet PCMag said that its writer in Britain had attempted to send a Huawei P30 handset to a colleague in the United States. FedEx returned the phone and told the sender that it could not deliver the package because of a \u201cU.S. government issue\u201d with Huawei and the Chinese government, PCMag reported.  FedEx\u2019s lawsuit and Chinese anger over the deliveries come against a backdrop of increasing tension between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.  Eric Hirschhorn, a former U.S. undersecretary of Commerce, said the lawsuit suggests \u201cthe company is caught in the middle between China and the U.S. They\u2019re being squeezed by two governments that are annoyed at each other and they\u2019re trying to do their business.\u201d","18":"FILE PHOTO: A FedEx Office logo is pictured in Times Square in the Manhattan borough of New York, NY, U.S., April 2, 2017.

FedEx Corp, an economic bellwether, fell about 11% in premarket trading as strong competition from Amazon.com Inc added to woes from the U.S.-China trade war, hitting the package delivery company\u2019s quarterly profit.  The Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates by a quarter percentage point for the second time in three months and provide clues on whether further monetary easing would be in order.  But a deep divide among policymakers has seen traders abandon all bets on a third reduction this year.

The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that the ban was due to FedEx\u2019s on-time performance.  Amazon said sellers can still use FedEx\u2019s pricier and faster Express services, including air transport, for Prime deliveries. The FedEx Ground and Home delivery options that are temporarily restricted for sellers\u2019 Prime shipments remain available for non-Prime shipments. Third-party sellers offer more than 50% of the goods on Amazon\u2019s site.  Amazon Prime members pay $119 per year for fast, \u201cfree\u201d delivery.  Tensions between Amazon and FedEx became public this summer. FedEx canceled its delivery agreements with the world\u2019s leading online retailer just months after Amazon announced plans to speed up Prime shipping to one day from two days on millions of items.  On-time delivery rates during the record-setting Cyber Monday sales week were 90.4% for FedEx Corp, 92.3% for the U.S. Postal Service and 92.7% for United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N, according to consultancy ShipMatrix.  Amazon van drivers delivered 93.7% of U.S. packages on time during that week.  ShipMatrix President Satish Jindel said the performances were not directly comparable because Amazon vans handle short-distance \u201clast-mile\u201d deliveries from fulfillment centers to customer doorsteps. Major shippers like FedEx and UPS move packages great distances - at times from factories on one U.S. coast to customer doorsteps on another - and are more exposed to weather and other disruptions.  News of the FedEx restrictions hit just ahead of FedEx\u2019s quarterly financial report on Tuesday.  \u201cIt\u2019s not about service, it\u2019s about being irritated with the relationship,\u201d Jindel said of Amazon\u2019s decision.  And it could have unintended consequences for Amazon, which is under increasing scrutiny from regulators, labor groups and consumer protection advocates.  \u201cIt will create more ill will toward Amazon and drive more third-party sellers to re-evaluate how they are managing their brands and if they want to be dictated to by Amazon,\u201d said Evan Armstrong, president of supply chain consulting firm Armstrong & Associates.","30":"A package of the FedEx courier delivery services company is pictured in this June 8, 2017 illustration photo.

Confronted by red tape and delays after Britain\u2019s messy exit from the European Union, Irish traders are shipping goods directly to and from European ports, shunning the once-speedier route through Britain.  \u201cYou see the shift in supply chains right here,\u201d he said.  All five operators connecting Ireland to mainland Europe have increased ferry services in the past nine months, with some bringing forward planned sailings and others moving larger ships away from quieter British routes to meet new demand.  Millet forecast Cherbourg would handle 9,000 trucks in January, equivalent to almost a quarter of what passed through the French port annually before the COVID-19 crisis.  For decades, the land bridge offered Irish traders the swiftest, most reliable route to continental Europe. It involves a short sea crossing between Dublin and Holyhead in Wales and then a hop between Dover and Calais. Every year 150,000 lorries would use the route.  But post-Brexit paperwork and delays in customs clearance are snarling up the process, adding hours or days to journeys and ratcheting up costs. Many companies are switching routes.  \u201cThis is a game-changer,\u201d said Chris Smyth, commercial director at Ireland\u2019s Perennial Freight. Demand was huge for freight space to ship to Cherbourg, Dunkirk, Rotterdam and Zeebrugge, he added.  Cherbourg\u2019s business before Brexit had been evenly split between Ireland and Britain. Now, the port would orient itself towards Ireland, Millet said.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  \u201cI thought traffic would double but it has tripled,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question now is whether the traffic volumes we see today will hold in the months to come.\u201d  AVOIDING THE MIDDLEMAN  Stena Line, the largest Irish Sea operator, has doubled its services on the booming Rosslare-Cherbourg route, temporarily cancelling some sailings to Britain after freight volumes fell 60% in the first half of January.  Irish Ferries has deployed a larger vessel out of Dublin and planned to add more weekly rotations next month, the Port of Cherbourg said. Brittany Ferries also brought forward a planned sailing linking France and Ireland.  Danish operator DFDS said the freight ferries plying its new 23-hour crossing from Rosslare to Dunkirk six days a week were \u201cpretty much full\u201d. Route director Aidan Coffey said capturing 30% of \u201cland bridge\u201d traffic would make the route viable and DFDS might soon add up to two more sailings per week.  \u201cWe\u2019re blown away by the demand,\u201d Coffey said.  No one knows if the shift is permanent.  The Irish Maritime Development Office, a government shipping promotion body, said a return to pre-Brexit logistic chains would depend on the speed of customs formalities along the land bridge and that ferries linking Ireland and mainland Europe could not replicate its volumes.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Eddie Burke, a senior official at Ireland\u2019s transport department, said the route through Britain would undoubtedly come back into play again.  Ferry operators were taking decisions on capacity week by week, said Ole Bockmann, Stena\u2019s operations chief in Cherbourg. Reverting to land bridge routes was simple, he said. \u201cWe just take the ships off and go back to the old system.\u201d  RENAISSANCE  It gives ports like Cherbourg and Ireland\u2019s Rosslare a narrow window to persuade traders that the longer sea crossing between Ireland and mainland Europe is commercially viable for just-in-time logistics.  Eighteen months ago, Rosslare on the southeastern tip of Ireland was struggling. Its traffic volumes were stagnant while rivals were enjoying a 10-year run of growth.  Now its general manager, Glenn Carr, is fending off complaints about the number trucks passing through after freight traffic increased 500% in the first half of January.  Carr said the old perception that direct crossings from Ireland were too long for fresh food and just-in-time supply chains was changing. Many of the companies that had switched from the land bridge would remain, he forecast.  \u201cI was talking to some multinationals only this week and the question they asked me was, \u2018Glenn, are you putting on more services?\u2019\u201d  An 18-hour ferry ride away, Cherbourg port\u2019s Millet said his immediate priority was responding to shipping companies demands for better restaurants and washrooms for truckers and ironing out quayside glitches in the loading of extra vessels.  \u201cBrexit has for us been an opportunity to rethink our port,\u201d he said.","35":"BP logo is seen at a fuel station of British oil company BP in St. Petersburg, October 18, 2012.

(Reuters) - With the U.S. economy facing significant headwinds, the Federal Reserve should align its balance sheet policy with its new \u201cpatient\u201d approach to interest rates, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly said on Wednesday.  FILE PHOTO: Mary Daly, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, poses after giving a speech on the U.S. economic outlook, in Idaho Falls, Idaho, U.S., November 12 2018. REUTERS\/Ann Saphir.\u00ca\/File Photo  \u201cWe don\u2019t want the balance sheet to be working at cross purposes with our interest rate policy,\u201d Daly told the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research.  The Fed has been shrinking its $4 trillion balance sheet by as much as $50 billion a month for more than a year, which investors say has been tightening financial conditions even as the central bank last month signaled it is putting its three-year-long campaign to raise interest rates on hold.  Rising downside risks, including slowing global growth, tighter financial conditions and rising uncertainty over trade and other policies, justify that pause in rate hikes, Daly said on Wednesday.  And with U.S. interest rates now within a \u201chair\u2019s breadth\u201d of neutral, Daly said she supports a halt on further increases until inflation rises sustainably to, or even above, the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target, or if there are signs of overheating in financial markets.  \u201cNeutral\u201d refers to rates that neither stimulate nor restrain growth.  And just as the Fed is adjusting its rates policy to financial and economic conditions, so too must it adjust its balance sheet policy, Daly suggested. \u201cThose two are meant to work together and not at cross purposes,\u201d she said.  Indeed, minutes of the Fed\u2019s January policy meeting, released earlier on Wednesday, signaled that the Fed will soon announce plans to stop shrinking its balance sheet later this year, but in the meantime the runoff continues.  The Fed last month left its target range for short-term interest rates at 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent and said it would be \u201cpatient\u201d in adjusting interest rates and would take economic and financial conditions into account in setting balance sheet policy.  Daly said on Wednesday that the U.S. economy is slowing faster than she had earlier thought - \u201cself-bridling\u201d she called it - but added that she believes its near-record-long expansion does not appear to be hitting a dead end.  \u201cThere\u2019s nothing on the radar that says we\u2019re slipping into recession,\u201d she said.","37":"* S&P500 hits 15-month low, Fed seen less dovish than hoped  * Australian shares hit 2-year trough, Nikkei at 9-month low  * 10-year U.S. bond yields at lowest level since April  TOKYO, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Asian shares retreated on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates, as expected, and kept most of its guidance for additional hikes next year, dashing investor hopes for a more dovish policy outlook.  MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.34 percent, with Australian shares dropping as much as 0.65 percent to two-year lows.  Japan\u2019s Nikkei shed 0.8 percent to nine-month lows.  In New York, U.S. S&P 500 Index lost 1.54 percent to hit its lowest level since September 2017. U.S. stocks are on pace for their biggest December decline since 1931, the depths of the Great Depression.  \u201cI think the Fed may be underestimating other factors at play,\u201d said Bob Baur, chief global economist at Principal Global Investors in Des Moines, Iowa in the Unites States.  \u201cTrade has been making headlines, but I think a gradual tightening of monetary policy has been the driving force behind recent market volatility. With corporate borrowing and spending still high, and the Fed continuing to reduce its balance sheet, I\u2019d expect volatility to remain if this tightening continues,\u201d he said.  The Fed raised key overnight lending rate rates by 0.25 percent point as expected to a range of 2.25 percent to 2.50 percent.  It said \u201csome\u201d further rate hikes would be necessary in the year ahead, with its policymakers projecting two rate hikes on average next year instead of three they saw back in September, a change that was also largely in line with expectations.  But the slight revision was not enough to ease market fears over further U.S. economic slowdown on the back of trade tensions, a waning boost from tax cuts and tightening monetary conditions for companies.  U.S. junk bonds were sold off sharply, with their ETFs falling 0.9 percent, the biggest decline since March 1.  As investors flocked to the safety of government bonds, the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell below its May 29 low of 2.759 percent to as low as 2.750 percent, a level last seen in early April.  A rise in short-term interest rates and a fall in the long-date yield rekindled worries of an inversion in the yield curve, where shorter-debt yields become higher than longer-term ones.  Historically an inversion between short-yields, such as three-month and two-year yields, and 10-year yields has been seen as a fairly reliable indicator of a recession down the road.  \u201cWe expect additional rate hikes will invert the three-months to 10-year yield curve which is a reliable signal for a bear market for stocks and a coming recession for both the U.S. and the rest of the world,\u201d said Jeffrey Kleintop, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab in Boston. \u201cSo seriously something to keep a close eye on. We do expect a very difficult year for investors.\u201d  The two-year U.S. yield stood at 2.656 percent, just 0.113 percent less than the 10-year yield.  As one 25 basis point rate hike would likely invert the yield curve, many market players are sceptical whether the Fed can raise rates at all next year.  Fed funds futures are now pricing in only about 50 percent chance of one rate hike.  The dollar bounced back against major currencies after the Fed was perceived to be more hawkish than anticipated.  The euro traded at $1.1380, off Wednesday\u2019s high of $1.14395 hit before the Fed\u2019s policy announcement.  The dollar stood at 112.44 yen, bouncing back from a seven-week low of 112.09 touched just before the Fed.  Commodity currencies fared worse due to weak oil prices.  The Australian dollar hit a seven-week low of $0.7085 late on Wednesday and last stood at $0.7116.  The Canadian dollar hit a 18-month trough of C$1.3507 per dollar and last traded at C$1.3485.  Later in the day, central banks from Japan, UK and Sweden will make policy announcements. All are expected to keep their policies on hold, though the Swedish central bank\u2019s decision is seen as a close call, with some analysts expecting a rate hike.  Oil prices remained battered near their lowest levels in more than a year although they posted some gains on Wednesday from sharp selloff earlier this week after U.S. data showed strong demand for refined products.  U.S. crude futures were little changed at $47.38 per barrel, having fallen to $45.79 earlier this week, the lowest since late August 2017.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  (Reuters) - FedEx Corp FDX.N said on Friday it could take as much as $575 million in charges as it began offering voluntary cash buyouts to certain U.S-based employees in a bid to reduce costs.  The parcel company announced in December that it would be offering voluntary buyouts to ease pressure on profits that have been hit by troubles in its express delivery unit and the integration of European company TNT.  FedEx had said that the vast majority of its buyout offers would be made to workers at the FedEx Express unit, which has 227,000 employees, and at FedEx Services, which employs 30,000 people.  The company also slashed its 2019 forecast that month blaming a weakening European economy and U.S. trade tensions that exacerbated a slowdown in China.  The Memphis, Tennessee-based company said on Friday it expects to incur charges of between $450 million and $575 million related to the buyout program predominantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.  It expects employees to vacate their positions by the end of fiscal 2019 and the program to save it between $225 million to $275 million annually beginning in fiscal 2020.  FedEx did not announce how many jobs it seeks to cut, but has said previously that it would extend similar voluntary buyouts to international workers too.  FedEx employs more than 450,000 people around the world, according to its latest annual filing. The company\u2019s shares closed up 2 percent on Friday and were unchanged in after hours trading.","39":"(Rewrites throughout with FBI notice to parcel delivery companies)  March 21 (Reuters) - The FBI has reminded parcel delivery companies in the United States to follow \u201cestablished protocols\u201d for handling suspicious packages following a bomb blast at a FedEx Corp sorting facility in Texas, an agency spokeswoman said on Wednesday.  A three-week bombing spree, which sent a shiver through the Texas capital of Austin and rattled the rest of the country, raised fears about the possibility of other attackers via package delivery.  \u201cIn light of the bombings in Austin the FBI has reached out to our private-sector partners to remind them of established protocols of how to handle suspicious packages,\u201d Federal Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Lindsay Ram said by email.  There was no suggestion by the FBI that FedEx had not followed protocols to the letter.  Federal prosecutors said on Wednesday they had charged Mark Conditt of Pflugerville, Texas, with unlawful possession and transfer of a destructive device before he blew himself up as police closed in on his vehicle.  FedEx, United Parcel Service Inc and other couriers collect a vast amount of data on packages in their systems. Some of the information may have helped identify the man who carried out the bombings, a FedEx executive said.  FedEx Chief Operations Officer David Bronczek told employees in an internal memo seen by Reuters that the company provided \u201ckey evidence\u201d to law enforcement officials on identifying the suspect.  The FBI\u2019s Ram did not elaborate on whether the agency was concerned about other deadly packages that may have slipped into a mail network that handles roughly 40 million parcels daily in the United States.  FedEx was taking the extraordinary step of screening every package at the sorting facility outside Austin where a parcel bomb exploded on a conveyor belt on Tuesday. It was also x-raying entire trailers filled with packages at that location and other trailers with packages originating from central Texas, a FedEx manager said.  FedEx spokesman Jim McCluskey declined to comment on package screening and on the evidence FedEx provided authorities.  Like FedEx, UPS shipping terms and conditions allow employees to open and inspect packages, and the companies train employees on how to respond if they see packages that look suspicious or may contain drugs.  FedEx and UPS have so far not described steps they may take to expand screening.  UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara said the company constantly evaluates and adjusts its security measures, but does not discuss them in order to maintain their effectiveness.  The United States Postal Service said in a statement that although it appeared none of the devices in Austin were sent through the U.S. mail, USPS reminded employees and customers to be observant about suspicious packages.  Inspectors in its Dangerous Mail Investigations Program \u201care trained to recognize the common characteristics of suspicious mail and are highly proficient in the use of state-of-the-art equipment to include portable X-ray machines,\u201d the USPS said.  The FedEx manager said in-bound international shipments are screened by x-ray or bomb-sniffing dogs, and said the Texas blast could lead to changes in domestic security screening.  Airport-like security measures inside package sorting facilities and retail locations would be a costly and unnecessary step that would paralyze operations, particularly given the rarity of package bombs, said Satish Jindel, a founder of the delivery company that became FedEx Ground.","40":"(Reuters) -Cargo planes and trucks with the first U.S. shipments of coronavirus vaccine fanned out from FedEx and UPS hubs in Tennessee and Kentucky on Sunday en route to distribution points around the country, launching an immunization project of unprecedented scope and complexity.  The inoculations, seen as pivotal to ultimately halting a surging pandemic that is claiming more than 2,400 U.S. lives a day, could begin as early as Monday.  The first are likely to be at vaccination sites closest to any of the 145 initial shipment destinations nationwide, or those nearest the FedEx Corp or United Parcel Service cargo centers that are relaying deliveries from the factory.  Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky suggested the very first injections of the vaccine will be given in his state, home to the UPS Worldport sorting facility in Louisville - one of two distribution command centers. The other is the FedEx air cargo hub in Memphis, Tennessee.  \u201cWe now believe that the first individuals will be vaccinated here in the commonwealth tomorrow morning. We are less than 24 hours away from the beginning of the end of this virus,\u201d Beshear wrote on Twitter on Sunday.  The coronavirus vaccine, developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, gained emergency-use approval from federal regulators late on Friday, clearing the way for distribution to begin a mere 11 months after the United States documented its first COVID-19 infections.  The monumental undertaking began early on Sunday with trucks carrying dry ice-cooled packages of vaccine - which must be kept at sub-Arctic temperatures - from Pfizer\u2019s facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan, to UPS and FedEx planes waiting at air fields in Lansing and Grand Rapids.  TWO HUBS, MANY SPOKES  From there, the delivery jets whisked the shipments to UPS and FedEx\u2019s respective cargo hubs in Louisville and Memphis, for distribution on planes and trucks to the first 145 of 636 vaccine-staging areas across the country. A second and third waves of vaccine shipments were due to go out to the remaining sites on Tuesday and Wednesday.  \u201cToday, we\u2019re not hauling freight, we\u2019re delivering hope,\u201d said Andrew Boyle, co-president of Boyle Transportation, which was hired by UPS to help ferry vaccine from the factory to a waiting plane in Lansing.  The precious cargo was escorted to airports by body-armor-clad security officers.  Boyle employee Bonnie Brewer, 56, said decades of experience hauling chemotherapies and other life-saving drugs prepared her for the historic run.  \u201cIt feels amazing,\u201d Brewer told Reuters after the cargo was safely handed off.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Healthcare workers and elderly residents of long-term care homes will be first in line to get the inoculations of a two-dose regimen given about three weeks apart.  Public health officials have warned Americans not to become complacent about wearing masks and avoiding crowds in the meantime.  More than 100 million people, or about 30% of the U.S. population, could be immunized by the end of March, U.S. Operation Warp Speed chief adviser Dr Moncef Slaoui said in an interview with Fox News Sunday.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  That would still leave the country far short of herd immunity that would halt virus transmission, so masks and social distancing will be needed for months to control the rampaging outbreak.  Health officials will also have to overcome widespread hesitancy about the new vaccines, with many Americans concerned the record speed at which they were developed may have compromised safety.  \u201cIt is however critical that most of the American people decide and accept to take the vaccine,\u201d Slaoui said. \u201cWe are very concerned by the hesitancy that we see.\u201d  SPECIAL DELIVERY  The massive logistical effort is further complicated by the need to transport and store the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine at minus 70 Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit), requiring enormous quantities of dry ice or specialized ultra-cold freezers.  Workers clapped and whistled as the first boxes were loaded onto trucks at the Pfizer factory. The long-awaited moment comes as the U.S. death toll was approaching 300,000 and infections and hospitalizations set daily records. Some models project that deaths could reach 500,000 before vaccines become widely available in the spring and summer. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/34pvUyi)  Slaoui said the United States hopes to have about 40 million vaccine doses - enough for 20 million people - distributed by the end of December. That would include vaccines from both Pfizer and Moderna Inc. An outside FDA advisory panel is scheduled to consider the Moderna vaccine on Thursday, with emergency use expected to be granted shortly after.  The Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine was found to be 95% effective in preventing illness in a large clinical trial. It is not yet known if it prevents infection or transmission of the coronavirus.  UPS and FedEx package delivery drivers are giving the vaccine priority over holiday gifts and other parcels, as health officials plead with the public to avoid holiday gatherings following a post-Thanksgiving spike in hospitalizations and deaths.  Both companies have expertise handling fragile medical products and are leaving little room for error. They are providing temperature and location tracking to backup devices embedded in the Pfizer boxes, and tracking each shipment throughout its journey.","41":"June 15 (Reuters) - Global delivery company FedEx Corp said on Friday that U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will raise prices for American businesses and consumers and are \u201ccounterproductive to U.S. economic interests.\u201d  \u201cFedEx supports lowering trade barriers for our customers,\u201d the company said in a statement.","42":"(Repeats for wider distribution)  Sept 29 (Reuters) - Out with grimy microwaves and sticky coffee machines with worn-out buttons, in with stylus pens, QR codes, no-touch water coolers and mobile apps that pick what brew the machine will make for you.  From the headquarters of Ford in Dearborn, Michigan and Goldman Sachs in New York to Fedex facilities across the United States, workers are returning after months of lockdowns to the new reality of social distancing, hybrid remote and office work schedules, and strict hygiene protocols.  The break room, where employees used to get their daily fix of caffeine and office gossip, is a big part of that reboot as coffee companies, such as Keurig Dr. Pepper, Lavazza and Nestle roll out new technology for the COVID-19 era.  Nestle says it has worked with manufacturers to add a function to its coffeemakers that lets users to make a selection by just hovering a finger over the menu and has been delivering those to clients since June.  Lavazza lauched a new model in September that works with a mobile app to whip up those cappuccinos and lattes without having to touch the machine.  U.S. coffee machine manufacturer Bunn has chosen a different approach, retrofitting its machines with a QR code that lets users order drinks through a webpage.  Last year, supplying offices with beans and brewers was a $5.7 billion business in the United States alone, according to research firm Packaged Facts. Coffee companies, which saw lockdowns wipe out so-called professional sales that also include the hospitality industry, bet they can revive that business by addressing workers' and employers' concerns. (Interactive graphic on U.S. coffee office service sector sales here tmsnrt.rs\/36fUSlh.)

It gave no names.  It issued the threat after Washington last month put Huawei on a blacklist that effectively blocks U.S. firms from doing business with the Shenzhen-based telecoms equipment maker.  Huawei told Reuters on Friday that it was reviewing its relationship with FedEx which it alleged had diverted two parcels destined for Huawei addresses in Asia to the United States and had attempted to reroute two others. FedEx said the packages were \u201cmisrouted in error\u201d.  Xinhua, without elaborating, said FedEx recently did not deliver to the right addressees and addresses in China.  In a statement on its website, FedEx said it would \u201cfully cooperate with any regulatory investigation into how we serve our customers.\u201d  On Tuesday, FedEx China apologized on its Chinese social media account for the \u201cmishandling\u201d of Huawei packages and confirmed there was no \u201cexternal pressure\u201d to divert packages.  Washington believes Huawei, the world\u2019s largest telecom network gear maker, is a potential espionage threat because of its close ties with the Chinese government.  Huawei has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services.  The issue has become a flashpoint in an escalating trade battle between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.  Last month, Washington slapped additional tariffs of up to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese goods, accusing Beijing of reneging on its previous promises to make structural changes to its economic practices.  That prompted Beijing to hit back with additional levies on the majority of U.S. imports on a $60 billion target list.  The Chinese tariffs took effect on Saturday.","45":"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The sudden deterioration in trade talks between the United States and China last month has ratcheted up concerns among U.S. firms that the dispute could go beyond tariffs and affect business in the long-term.  FILE PHOTO: People visit a FedEx Express booth during the China International Import Expo (CIIE) at the National Exhibition and Convention Center in Shanghai, China November 7, 2018. REUTERS\/Stringer  Business associations and consultants say they have been fielding a growing number of inquiries from companies about how best to navigate the trade dispute. They expect those calls to intensify after FedEx Corp over the weekend became embroiled in U.S.-China frictions and an ongoing spat over Chinese tech giant Huawei.  Further rattling nerves are Beijing\u2019s plans to unveil an unprecedented hit-list of \u201cunreliable\u201d foreign firms, groups and individuals that harm the interests of Chinese companies. China\u2019s commerce ministry announced the move on Friday without singling out any country or company.  The US-China Business Council (USCBC), which represents roughly 200 American companies that do business in China, told Reuters on Monday that anxiety among its members was on the rise, especially over the list.  \u201cThe key point for them is that there\u2019s a great deal of uncertainty on how the list will be implemented and what negative repercussions will be brought about should a company be added to the list,\u201d said its vice president of China operations, Jacob Parker.  \u201cAt the moment many of our companies are wondering whether this is an attempt by the Chinese government to increase their potential leverage in the trade negotiations, or if it\u2019s an actual effort to force companies into an unenviable position of choosing between the two markets.\u201d  LOOMING LIST  Analysts said U.S. companies had been more sanguine in the initial stage of the trade war, with many believing that it could not possibly go on, but that began to change after Washington last month accused Beijing of reneging on previous promises, prompting fresh tit-for-tat tariffs.  The United States also last month put China\u2019s Huawei on a blacklist that effectively blocks U.S. firms from doing business with the Shenzhen-based telecoms equipment maker, aggravating existing frictions.  \u201cWe have in the last three weeks fielded more calls from firms wondering about the political risk here than we probably have in the last 10 years,\u201d said Ben Cavender, an analyst at China Market Research Group, whose clients have ranged from clothing retailers to chemical firms.  \u201cRight now there\u2019s a lot more concern that the situation regarding the negotiations has become so unstable and so emotional, when or if there\u2019s going to be a resolution.\u201d  It is unclear exactly how many U.S. companies do business with China, but the American Chambers of Commerce (AmCham) in Beijing and Shanghai count more than 2,000 member firms between them.  \u201cThis is a discouraging development,\u201d said AmCham Shanghai President Ker Gibbs. \u201cWe are concerned and have requested more information about the list. We hope that both sides can refrain from this type of tit-for-tat behavior and get back to the negotiating table.\u201d  Beijing-based AmCham China did not respond to a request for comment.  \u201cAt least three clients have asked us about how the entity list might affect their business,\u201d said a Shanghai-based consultant, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation.  Even some British firms had sought advice, he added, saying they were expressing worry over U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to Britain this week, when he is expected to demand that Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s successor ban Huawei from 5G networks.  \u201cThey fear that the U.S. president might pressure the incoming prime minister to follow his policies,\u201d the consultant said.  SOUTH KOREA EXPERIENCE  One big concern, analysts said, was that U.S. firms could start to experience similar treatment to that doled out to South Korean companies in 2017, after China opposed Seoul\u2019s decision to install a U.S. missile system.  South Korea\u2019s fifth-largest conglomerate Lotte, was among the worst hit. Chinese authorities suspended its work on a $2.6 billion project and ordered Lotte Mart stores to shut over what they said were fire safety violations. Company officials privately linked the action to the missile spat.  \u201cIt would not be inconceivable that China will look at, for example, large retail brands that are operating here and saying, well maybe they should also have fire code violations too. That would create immediate harm to a lot of businesses,\u201d Cavender said.  Another worry is that U.S. corporate officials could personally start to face scrutiny or be investigated in China as a result of the trade frictions, one China-based foreign executive told Reuters on condition of anonymity.  Some, he added, were \u201cexploring summer plans abroad\u201d, having not previously considered doing so, because they were worried about getting caught in the crossfire.  \u201cMany U.S. senior executives in China that I know have this growing concern right now.\u201d","46":"** Brokerage Baird cuts PT of FedEx Corp to $180 from $190 on risks to FY 2020 EPS due to weakness in volumes and incremental costs  ** Broker says PT cut is unrelated to FedEx\u2019s Friday decision to end Amazon contract for FedEx Express plan service  ** Adds that Baird believes the Amazon announcement is more strategically symbolic than material from financial standpoint as the online retailer accounts for a less than 1.3% of FDX\u2019s rev in 2018  ** The slight trim in PT caused by continued weakness in global AF volumes, incremental costs, in part within its Ground segment - Baird  ** FDX\u2019s Ground segment recently announced decision to expand residential delivery service rollout to 7-days-per-week year-round  ** FDX shares down ~2% this year vs rival UPS\u2019s ~0.7% gain and AMZN\u2019s 20% rise YTD (Reporting by Yadarisa Shabong in Bengaluru)","47":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -U.S. delivery firm FedEx Corp on Thursday said quarterly profit almost doubled after rate hikes and spiking volume helped lower the cost of delivering pandemic-fueled e-commerce purchases to residential addresses.

The central bank is due to announce its decision at 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT) after its final two-day policy meeting of the year. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to hold a press conference half an hour later.  Investors widely expect the Fed will lift borrowing costs by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of between 2.25 percent and 2.50 percent. It would be the fourth rate hike of the year and the ninth since the central bank began its current tightening cycle in December 2015.  A rate hike on Wednesday could draw the ire of the White House. President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked the Fed for raising rates this year, saying it was undercutting his efforts to boost the economy. On Tuesday, Trump warned Fed policymakers not to \u201cmake yet another mistake.\u201d  The Fed\u2019s tightening is designed to reduce the monetary policy boost to a U.S. economy that is now growing much faster than central bank policymakers think it can sustain.  With the price of oil tumbling, economic growth in Europe and China slipping, and the fiscal stimulus from the Trump administration\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut package expected to fade, Fed policymakers appear ready to back away from their prior view that the economy could weather three more rate hikes next year.  Fresh Fed economic forecasts to be released along with the policy statement may suggest that two rate hikes is more likely, economists say. Traders of interest rate futures do not even think the Fed will manage one hike.  \u201cYou are at an inflection point,\u201d said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. \u201cYou are most likely seeing growth slowing and you don\u2019t know how much growth and what kind of growth is left over after the fiscal stimulus wears off. And that\u2019s why they don\u2019t know if they need zero, one, or more rate hikes.\u201d  U.S. stocks were broadly higher Wednesday morning on investor optimism the Fed would signal it was near the end of its tightening cycle. The S&P 500 index has tumbled more than 12 percent since late September and, barring a turnaround, is on pace for its poorest December performance since 1931.  With borrowing costs after Wednesday\u2019s expected rate hike close to, if not in, the broad range that Fed officials have identified as \u201cneutral\u201d for a healthy economy, policymakers are also likely to emphasize that future rate-setting decisions will hinge on new economic data.  That may be particularly important as data pulls the central bank in different directions, with a strong labor market and robust output suggesting the need for higher rates, and a weaker global economy and U.S. bond yields suggesting not.  The divergence between the U.S. economy and the rest of the world was cast into stark relief after FedEx Corp slashed its profit outlook on Tuesday. FedEx, seen as a bellwether for global trade, flagged a litany of issues including a Brexit-led slowdown in the United Kingdom, a contraction in the German economy and slowing China demand due to an ongoing trade spat with the United States.  FORWARD GUIDANCE  Economists say the Fed will probably modify or remove from its policy statement a reference to the likelihood that \u201cfurther gradual increases\u201d in its key overnight lending rate will be needed.  Doing so would mark one more step in the Fed\u2019s march away from its reliance on forward guidance to shape market expectations in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.  It could also help the central bank guard against criticism, whether from Trump or others, by allowing Powell to point to the economic realities on the ground as forcing his hand on any future rate hikes.  \u201cThey want to get to the place where they can say all decisions are data-dependent,\u201d said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Standish Mellon Asset Management.","49":"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese authorities in the southern city of Guangzhou detained a U.S. pilot for FedEx Corp FDX.N last week on suspicion of smuggling weapons and ammunition after finding suspected air gun pellets in his luggage, the foreign ministry said on Friday.  The man, identified by the Wall Street Journal as former U.S. Air Force pilot Todd Hohn, arrived in Guangzhou having piloted a FedEx freighter aircraft into the city on Sept. 11, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said.  On the morning of Sept. 12, customs at Guangzhou airport found and seized a suspected box of 681 air gun pellets in the luggage of the pilot, Geng said, adding he had been due to fly to Hong Kong that day.  He was later released from custody, subject to provision of a surety, pending investigation for the suspected smuggling of weapons and ammunition, Geng told a daily news briefing.  The Journal said Hohn was not being allowed to leave China until the investigation concludes.  Hohn could not be reached for a comment, and calls to the Guangzhou police were not answered.  FedEx, which did not name Hohn, said in a statement it was \u201cworking with the appropriate authorities to gain a better understanding of the facts.\u201d  A FedEx spokeswoman declined to give any details when asked if Hohn was being prevented from leaving China.  Hohn\u2019s detention comes at a difficult time in China for FedEx, which has become one of the most high-profile corporate brands to get caught up in the U.S.-China trade dispute and other frictions.  The Memphis-based company has been the target of Chinese ire over shipping mistakes involving several packages, including parcels addressed to China's Huawei Technologies Co HWT.UL, which Washington has put on an export blacklist.  Geng did not name Hohn, but said Guangzhou customs had blocked the pilot from leaving the country \u201con suspicion of smuggling weapons and ammunition.\u201d  Chinese authorities informed the U.S. consulate in Guangzhou a day after he was detained, Geng said, adding that the case was still under investigation.  A U.S. State Department official said the department was tracking developments.  \u201cWe take seriously our responsibility to assist U.S. citizens abroad, and are monitoring the situation,\u201d the official said in an email to Reuters.  The Wall Street Journal first reported the case on Thursday.  Earlier this week, FedEx slashed its fiscal 2020 profit forecast by 18 percent. Executives said the U.S.-China trade war is dampening key economies in Europe and Asia and hurting its Express business, which moves parcels and freight via airplane around the globe.  Hong Kong, where the Journal said Hohn lived, has been rocked since June by large, sometimes violent street protests that have presented Beijing with its biggest political challenge in decades.","50":"(Reuters) - Out with grimy microwaves and sticky coffee machines with worn-out buttons, in with stylus pens, QR codes, no-touch water coolers and mobile apps that pick what brew the machine will make for you.

DUCKER TO RETIRE AUGUST 15  * FEDEX CORP - DUCKER\u2019S SUCCESSOR WILL BE NAMED LATER Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","52":"(Repeats with no changes)  March 21 (Reuters) - FedEx Corp will screen every package at the Texas facility where a parcel exploded on Tuesday, according to a FedEx manager, describing extraordinary steps the company is taking in response to a series of bombings in the state capital.  The package delivery company will also X-ray entire truckloads of parcels at its sorting facility outside Austin, and then divert them elsewhere for sorting and delivery, said the FedEx employee who was not authorized to speak on the record. The source does not work at the sorting facility but was briefed on the situation.  FedEx spokesman Jim McCluskey said he had no immediate comment.  The blast at FedEx on Tuesday was one of six explosions in Texas in the past 18 days. The attacks have killed two people, injured others and left hundreds of federal and local investigators scrambling to find the perpetrator and a motive.  Package screening is not routine at the nation\u2019s big delivery companies such as FedEx, United Parcel Service Inc or the U.S. Postal Service. The industry delivers a total of around 40 million parcels in the United States each day, industry experts said. Checking every package on a regular basis would virtually paralyze their operations.  FedEx will carry out the special screenings at the sorting facility in Schertz, Texas where the package exploded, injuring one worker, and at a second location in Austin, where another explosive device was found, the employee said. The second package was turned over to police.  \u201cFedEx in conjunction with the authorities are field X-raying all the packages one at a time,\u201d the employee said. \u201cFrom then on, we will be doing bulk X-rays of entire trailers.\u201d  Packages will likely be delayed by a day or two at the facility, and FedEx was re-routing all other packages to its hub in Houston to avoid further delays, he said.  FedEx has provided law enforcement with \u201cextensive evidence from our advanced technology security systems designed to protect the safety of our teammates, our customers and the communities we serve,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith told analysts on Tuesday after the company reported quarterly financial results.  FedEx will provide authorities with the location where the package was picked up by the driver and the time, the employee said, providing authorities with a wealth of data.  Satish Jindel, a founder of the delivery company that became FedEx Ground and now serves as president of ShipMatrix, which tracks on-time shipments, said it was highly unlikely that the industry would move toward routine screening. Package bombs are rare, he said, making it unrealistic to check every package, every day, considering the enormous cost.  \u201cThey don\u2019t, they can\u2019t, and they shouldn\u2019t, and it would be unreasonable and ignorant for this country and for people to expect it,\u201d Jindel said. \u201cIt would shut the economy down.\u201d  For now, the industry will likely rely on employees who are trained to flag suspicious packages, Jindel said.  UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara said the world\u2019s largest package delivery company has security measures in place and was cooperating with law enforcement in their investigation, but declined to comment further.  DHL Worldwide Express said it had \u201cstandard\u201d security and screening procedures in place and that its security teams were monitoring the situation in Texas.  The U.S. Postal Service uses technology, targeted screening and employee training to stop suspicious packages, spokesman Dave Partenheimer said.  The FedEx manager with knowledge of the incident said the blast appeared to have been set off by a mechanical arm that diverts packages along a conveyer belt. When the arm came out and hit the package, it exploded on the sorter just as it entered a chute, he said.  \u201cThe good thing is it went off when it was going down the chute,\u201d he said. \u201cThe chute actually shielded anybody below from the blast.\u201d","53":"(Reuters) - U.S. insurer MetLife Inc MET.N has entered into an agreement to provide pension benefits for about 41,000 FedEx Corp FDX.N retirees and beneficiaries through an annuity, the two companies said on Tuesday.

The deal is the first \u201cjumbo-sized\u201d U.S. transfer of pension obligations to an insurer, measured by premium, since 2013, wrote Wells Fargo Securities LLC analyst Sean Dargan in a research note late on Tuesday.  It also marks MetLife\u2019s entry into the market for jumbo-sized transfers, Dargan wrote. The insurer has historically competed for pension transfer deals with less than $1 million in premiums, Dargan wrote.  Some life insurers, including Prudential Financial Inc PRU.N and MetLife, take over corporate pension plans from companies that want to offload them. The insurers then use a group annuity to make regular payments to the retirees and beneficiaries who are entitled to benefits under those pensions.  These deals, known as pension risk transfers, have been around for at least 90 years, but rising interest rates and stock market values are expected to make it easier for more companies unload their plans to insurers.  In 2017, MetLife disclosed that it had failed to make payments to pensioners whom it could not locate after taking over their plans from private companies. MetLife since been trying to locate the individuals, whom it intends to pay, the company has said.  The deal \u201cis a vote of confidence after MET\u2019s group annuitant issues and charges of the recent past,\u201d Dargan wrote.  FedEx\u2019s purchase of the group annuity contract will be funded by assets of its pension plan, the company said.

Citing unnamed sources close to the company, Handelsblatt said financial investor Advent was still in the running for a stake in the company in Britain.  Representatives from Otto and FedEx each declined comment.  FedEx has a limited presence in the European consumer parcel delivery sector.  The Memphis-based company said last month it would tap debt markets to bolster reserves as the novel coronavirus hammers its higher-profit business-to-business shipments, while driving up demand for low-margin home deliveries.  While a tie-up with Hermes could create some efficiencies, experts said the deal is not without risks.

The developments mark the latest fallout from Washington\u2019s trade ban on Huawei, which has not only rattled the global technology supply chain tied to Huawei\u2019s $105 billion business but also is causing much confusion among companies and organizations well beyond the U.S. borders regarding the limits of restrictions.  FedEx has apologized for multiple incidents of diversion of Huawei packages, which it attributed to \u201coperational errors\u201d, but it later sued the U.S. government for what it said was an \u201cimpossible task\u201d to \u201cpolice the contents\u201d of export shipments.  FedEx said on Friday that it initiated the suit against the U.S. DOC \u201cto prevent similar occurrences happening in the future\u201d and reiterated its commitment to the Chinese market.  Huawei told Reuters on Thursday that Flex had withheld some 700 million yuan ($102 million) worth of its goods in its China factory, confirming a report by Chinese government-backed newspaper Global Times.  Flex kept the Huawei assets in its factory in the southern city of Zhuhai after the U.S. blacklisting and caused losses for Huawei, according to the report.  Huawei told Reuters that it has retrieved some 400 million yuan of goods last month after negotiations and is still trying to take back the rest.

REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  Bullard said the conversations occurred \u201cin recent months\u201d as President Donald Trump pressed the Fed to reduce interest rates and considered candidates for two open board seats. Bullard has also made the case for lower rates, and at the central bank\u2019s most recent policy meeting earlier this month he dissented from the decision to leave rates unchanged.  \u201cI have been approached on this. I am happy in my current position,\u201d Bullard said in remarks to reporters ahead of an event at the St. Louis Fed. \u201cI think these kinds of discussions are exploratory in nature and it\u2019d be very unclear whether it would go any further.\u201d  Trump has grown increasingly critical of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in recent months, slamming him for steering the Fed to hike interest rate four times last year, which the president says has curbed economic growth and made it harder for him to negotiate a trade deal with China.  But Trump has also struggled to fill two open seats on the Fed\u2019s seven-member board. Fed governors set interest-rate policy along with five of the 12 reserve bank presidents who rotate through voting seats on the central bank\u2019s rate-setting committee; the two appointees on their own would have a limited voice in the matter.  Members of the Board of Governors are appointed by the president and are subject to Senate confirmation. The heads of the 12 regional banks are nominated by the directors of the local Fed boards and require no such confirmation.  Trump hopes to have nominees for the open Board of Governor seats soon, an administration official said on Tuesday.  Bullard, who holds a doctorate in economics, would check a number of boxes for Trump as a candidate whose deep experience in central banking would likely clear the Senate, and who also argued early on that the Fed should stop hiking rates.  Bullard, who currently holds a vote on the Fed\u2019s rate-setting committee, said in comments to reporters that he felt the Fed should make an initial reduction of a quarter of a percentage point at an upcoming meeting, and make a second reduction later in the year. That, he said, would set the stage for an economic \u201csoft landing\u201d and help ensure continued growth into 2020.  \u201cI felt we are a little bit restrictive,\u201d Bullard said. \u201cIf you went one move now and another later you would be slightly accommodative and that would shore up\u201d the outlook for inflation and growth.  Trump\u2019s two candidates for the open board seats withdrew from consideration earlier this year, after some Republican senators expressed reservations, indicating that both would likely struggle to win confirmation in the Republican-controlled Senate.  Herman Cain, the former head of the Godfather\u2019s Pizza restaurant chain who had made a bid for the presidency in 2012 was a public advocate of many of Trump\u2019s policies, withdrew from consideration in late April.

The package delivery company will also X-ray entire truckloads of parcels at its sorting facility outside Austin, and then divert them elsewhere for sorting and delivery, said the FedEx employee who was not authorized to speak on the record. The source does not work at the sorting facility but was briefed on the situation.  FedEx spokesman Jim McCluskey said he had no immediate comment.  The blast at FedEx on Tuesday was one of six explosions in Texas in the past 18 days. The attacks have killed two people, injured others and left hundreds of federal and local investigators scrambling to find the perpetrator and a motive.  Package screening is not routine at the nation\u2019s big delivery companies such as FedEx, United Parcel Service Inc or the U.S. Postal Service. The industry delivers a total of around 40 million parcels in the United States each day, industry experts said. Checking every package on a regular basis would virtually paralyze their operations.  FedEx will carry out the special screenings at the sorting facility in Schertz, Texas where the package exploded, injuring one worker, and at a second location in Austin, where another explosive device was found, the employee said. The second package was turned over to police.  \u201cFedEx in conjunction with the authorities are field X-raying all the packages one at a time,\u201d the employee said. \u201cFrom then on, we will be doing bulk X-rays of entire trailers.\u201d  Packages will likely be delayed by a day or two at the facility, and FedEx was re-routing all other packages to its hub in Houston to avoid further delays, he said.  FedEx has provided law enforcement with \u201cextensive evidence from our advanced technology security systems designed to protect the safety of our teammates, our customers and the communities we serve,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith told analysts on Tuesday after the company reported quarterly financial results.  FedEx will provide authorities with the location where the package was picked up by the driver and the time, the employee said, providing authorities with a wealth of data.  Satish Jindel, a founder of the delivery company that became FedEx Ground and now serves as president of ShipMatrix, which tracks on-time shipments, said it was highly unlikely that the industry would move toward routine screening. Package bombs are rare, he said, making it unrealistic to check every package, every day, considering the enormous cost.  \u201cThey don\u2019t, they can\u2019t, and they shouldn\u2019t, and it would be unreasonable and ignorant for this country and for people to expect it,\u201d Jindel said. \u201cIt would shut the economy down.\u201d  For now, the industry will likely rely on employees who are trained to flag suspicious packages, Jindel said.

The U.S. Postal Service uses technology, targeted screening and employee training to stop suspicious packages, spokesman Dave Partenheimer said.  The FedEx manager with knowledge of the incident said the blast appeared to have been set off by a mechanical arm that diverts packages along a conveyer belt.

REUTERS\/Philippe Wojazer  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Mass shootings happen in an instant and grab headlines. A business and investment shift away from the firearms industry is happening more subtly. FedEx, the U.S. shipping group, is ending a program that offers discounts for business members of the National Rifle Association, the company confirmed to Breakingviews.  It\u2019s a quiet reversal: eight months ago, FedEx stood by the gun-rights lobby group as other companies scrapped deals. They were reacting to the NRA\u2019s stance after 17 students and staff members were murdered at a Florida high school by a former student. Companies including Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and car-rental firm Enterprise swiftly ended member discounts. At the time, FedEx said that while assault rifles of the kind used in most American mass shootings shouldn\u2019t be in civilian hands, it did not believe in \u201cdiscriminating\u201d between organizations it works with.  The change of tack comes just days after a gunman killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue. The $56 billion logistics company says the closure of its NRA discount program from Nov. 4 has no connection to that incident or any other shooting. Rather, the NRA just didn\u2019t bring in enough business to merit its own deal. It\u2019s among dozens of organizations FedEx plans to move to new pricing programs, and the company has been notifying customers since early October.  That, though, is still significant \u2013 perhaps more so than largely political gestures. It suggests the NRA no longer has the economic clout to inspire fear in the corporate world. The group nearly put gunmaker Smith & Wesson out of business in 2000 when it branded the company a \u201csellout\u201d for agreeing to back stronger gun controls. Boycotts from NRA members followed, and Smith & Wesson\u2019s chief executive lost his job.  Gun-rights lobbyists have resisted both technology that could make firearms safer and no-brainer efforts like making more federal data on firearms incidents readily available. But companies are becoming less timid. When retailers Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Walmart and Kroger pledged to end sales of assault rifles earlier this year, their shares didn\u2019t suffer. As customers and investors change their views, businesses no longer need to take an overtly political stance \u2013 they can just follow the money.","80":"June 7 (Reuters) - FedEx Corp said on Friday it \u201chas made the strategic decision to not renew the FedEx Express U.S. domestic contract with Amazon.com Inc\u201d.

The e-commerce company expects to roll out a new delivery service, dubbed \"Shipping with Amazon\" or SWA, in Los Angeles in coming weeks, the Wall Journal reported citing people familiar with the matter.

Amazon, which would have to invest $100 billion to compete with UPS and FedEx, according to some analysts, appears to be targeting the \u201clast mile\u201d deliveries to households fueled by online shopping, which has grown fast in recent years but is a lower margin business.  \u201cTo date (Amazon) hasn\u2019t made a meaningful push into the true transportation asset ownership we believe is necessary to be a competitor.

Chinese authorities investigating FedEx suspect it illegally held back the Huawei packages and that it also violated other laws, state news agency Xinhua reported on Friday.  Beijing started a probe into FedEx last month after Huawei said the U.S. delivery firm had diverted parcels intended for it. It came after Huawei was placed by Washington on a blacklist in mid-May that effectively blocks U.S. firms from doing business with the Shenzhen-based telecoms equipment maker.  \u201cThe investigation showed that FedEx was suspected of holding up more than 100 Huawei packages entering China,\u201d Xinhua said. \u201cInvestigators also discovered clues to other violations of the company.\u201d  FedEx had no immediate comment on the report. Huawei declined to comment.  The report comes a day after Huawei said electronics contract manufacturer Flex \u201cseized\u201d its goods in China.  The developments mark the latest fallout from Washington\u2019s trade ban on Huawei, which has not only rattled the global technology supply chain tied to Huawei\u2019s $105 billion business but also is causing much confusion among companies and organisations well beyond the U.S. borders regarding the limits of restrictions.  FedEx has apologised for multiple incidents of diversion of Huawei packages, which it attributed to \u201coperational errors\u201d, but it later sued the U.S. government for what it said was an \u201cimpossible task\u201d to \u201cpolice the contents\u201d of export shipments.  Huawei told Reuters on Thursday that Flex had withheld some 700 million yuan ($101.81 million) worth of its goods in its China factory, confirming a report by Chinese government-backed newspaper Global Times.  Flex kept the Huawei assets in its factory in the southern city of Zhuhai after the U.S. blacklisting and caused losses for Huawei, according to the report.  Huawei told Reuters that it has retrieved some 400 million yuan of goods last month after negotiations and is still trying to take back the rest.  Flex said in an emailed statement to Reuters, \u201cFlex and Huawei have had a long-standing and successful partnership which has recently been impacted by unforeseen challenges resulting from the US\/China trade situation. Both parties are actively working to find a mutually agreeable way forward given these facts.\u201d  A Flex spokesman declined to say whether it still held any Huawei assets or counts Huawei as a customer, but said China remains \u201ca very important center of production and end-market\u201d where it employs tens of thousands of people.  Flex said on Friday in its quarterly earnings statement that it would accelerate a move to reduce its exposure to certain products in China and India after \u201crecent geopolitical developments and uncertainties\u201d, which primarily impacted \u201cone customer in China\u201d. It did not name the customer.  \u201cWe have seen a reduction in demand for products assembled for that customer,\u201d it said.

Its board also approved a 91% reduction in Chief Executive Frederick Smith\u2019s base salary for six months starting April 1, according to a regulatory filing on Friday.  The global health crisis has compounded woes at FedEx, which already was struggling to integrate TNT Express, grappling with the high cost of launching Sunday home delivery, and compensating for the loss of Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O as a customer.  Shares in FedEx fell 6.7% to $108.82 in midday trading.  FedEx and larger rival United Parcel Service UPS.N have asked the U.S. Treasury to move quickly to release billions of dollars in government grants and loans to support the sector.  FedEx said it expects to benefit from excise tax relief and payroll tax referrals. It is also eligible for government grants, loans and investment programs.  It warned that participation in such programs could restrict FedEx\u2019s ability to pay dividends to shareholders and to buy back stock. It could also require the company to grant equity interests in FedEx to a government agency.  FedEx has responded to the business crisis by cutting spending, eliminating money-back delivery guarantees, and slapping temporary surcharges on all international package and air freight shipments.  The company\u2019s moneymaking air business has gotten a boost from the grounding of passenger aircraft - which carry half of total air cargo. But that may not continue, FedEx said.  \u201cDue to weakening economic conditions in Europe and the United States and resulting decreases in demand for goods manufactured in Asia, there are no assurances that these increased levels of demand will be sustainable,\u201d FedEx said.

The world\u2019s largest online retailer ordered more than 2,200 heavy-duty Utilimaster \u201cwalk-in\u201d delivery trucks from Shyft Group, a Michigan-based specialty vehicle company, an Amazon spokeswoman told Reuters. The company declined to say how many of the vehicles have been sent to Amazon delivery contractors, or where they would be deployed.  Amazon is under pressure to make good on one- and two-day deliveries promised to customers who subscribe to its $119 annual Prime service. Orders for food, computers, toys and exercise equipment surged after states issued stay-at-home orders to battle the pandemic, overwhelming Amazon\u2019s network and adding days and even weeks to delivery times.  Drivers assigned to the new trucks showed Reuters training materials from Wisconsin-based safety and compliance consultancy J.J. Keller & Associates, which confirmed that Amazon is a client. The Shyft Group did not respond to requests for comment.  One of the new Amazon trucks was seen recently operating in Chicago, according to a Reuters reporter. Training is under way in the Los Angeles area, drivers said.  While Amazon purchased the vehicles last year, the branded trucks have been parked for months in locations around the United States, including in Amazon lots in New Jersey and California dairy country. The company declined to state why it waited so long to roll out the new fleet.  Drivers familiar with the new vehicles said they can carry more and bigger packages than the Mercedes-Benz, Fiat Chrysler, and Ford Motor Co vans Amazon contractors dispatch around the country.  Two drivers, who declined to be named for fear of retaliation, opted not to switch to the new vehicles because they are heavier and more difficult to maneuver than Amazon vans.  Amazon came under fire last year for failing to properly train drivers who work for its fast-growing network of delivery partners. ProPublica, BuzzFeed and other news outlets published reports detailing Amazon van accidents that resulted in injuries and deaths.  Amazon suspended its upstart Amazon Shipping program for non-Amazon packages in June to prioritize deliveries to its own customers.

The package delivery company will also X-ray entire truckloads of parcels at its sorting facility outside Austin, and then divert them elsewhere for sorting and delivery, said the FedEx employee who was not authorized to speak on the record. The source does not work at the sorting facility but was briefed on the situation.  FedEx spokesman Jim McCluskey said he had no immediate comment.  The blast at FedEx on Tuesday was one of five explosions in Texas in the past 18 days. A sixth explosion on Tuesday night did not appear related, authorities said. The five attacks have killed two people, injured others and left hundreds of federal and local investigators scrambling to find the perpetrator and a motive.  Package screening is not routine at the nation\u2019s big delivery companies such as FedEx, United Parcel Service Inc or the U.S. Postal Service. The industry delivers a total of around 40 million parcels in the United States each day, industry experts said. Checking every package on a regular basis would virtually paralyze their operations.  FedEx will carry out the special screenings at the sorting facility in Schertz, Texas where the package exploded, injuring one worker, and at a second location in Austin, where another explosive device was found, the employee said. The second package was turned over to police.  \u201cFedEx in conjunction with the authorities are field X-raying all the packages one at a time,\u201d the employee said. \u201cFrom then on, we will be doing bulk X-rays of entire trailers.\u201d  Packages will likely be delayed by a day or two at the facility, and FedEx was re-routing all other packages to its hub in Houston to avoid further delays, he said.  FedEx has provided law enforcement with \u201cextensive evidence from our advanced technology security systems designed to protect the safety of our teammates, our customers and the communities we serve,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith told analysts on Tuesday after the company reported quarterly financial results.  FedEx will provide authorities with the location where the package was picked up by the driver and the time, the employee said, providing authorities with a wealth of data.  Satish Jindel, a founder of the delivery company that became FedEx Ground and now serves as president of ShipMatrix, which tracks on-time shipments, said it was highly unlikely that the industry would move toward routine screening. Package bombs are rare, he said, making it unrealistic to check every package, every day, considering the enormous cost.  \u201cThey don\u2019t, they can\u2019t, and they shouldn\u2019t, and it would be unreasonable and ignorant for this country and for people to expect it,\u201d Jindel said. \u201cIt would shut the economy down.\u201d  For now, the industry will likely rely on employees who are trained to flag suspicious packages, Jindel said.  UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara said the world\u2019s largest package delivery company has security measures in place and was cooperating with law enforcement in their investigation, but declined to comment further.  DHL Worldwide Express said it had \u201cstandard\u201d security and screening procedures in place and that its security teams were monitoring the situation in Texas.  The U.S. Postal Service uses technology, targeted screening and employee training to stop suspicious packages, spokesman Dave Partenheimer said.  The FedEx manager with knowledge of the incident said the blast appeared to have been set off by a mechanical arm that diverts packages along a conveyer belt. When the arm came out and hit the package, it exploded on the sorter just as it entered a chute, he said.  \u201cThe good thing is it went off when it was going down the chute,\u201d he said. \u201cThe chute actually shielded anybody below from the blast.\u201d","108":"BEIJING, June 14 (Reuters) - Chinese authorities sent an official inquiry to FedEx Corp over parcels that were delivered incorrectly, China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency reported on Friday.

Investors expect Chairman Jerome Powell to explain the Fed\u2019s position at a news briefing after the rate decision.  \u201cThe interesting aspect for me will be how Chair Powell characterizes recent strength in the data without sounding hawkish at the same time, because they do want to keep the door open for more cuts,\u201d said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale in New York.

Possibly further complicating the Fed\u2019s discussions, short-term U.S. interest rates shot up this week, with overnight repo rates rising to 7%, due largely to seasonal factors such as huge payments for taxes and bond supply.

Bond yields tumbled also on expectations of an imminent rate cut from the Federal Reserve in a bid to stabilize markets and the economy with manufacturing growth cooling to its weakest pace in 2-1\/2 years in May. \"It's just that things seem to be getting bad enough every day that the Fed is going to cut,\" said Gennadiy Goldberg, U.S. senior interest rates strategist at TD Securities. The near $16-trillion sector produced a total return of 2.35% in May, its strongest monthly showing since August 2011, according to an index compiled by Bloomberg and Barclays. Long-dated Treasuries generated a stellar 6.7% return, their juiciest performance since January 2015, as the safe-haven market rally knocked 10-year yields some 36 basis points lower last month. In just a month they leapfrogged junk bonds as the best performing U.S. bond sector so far this year. Treasuries were among the top assets in the world in May. They handily beat stocks but trailed the yen somewhat. At 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT), benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell 6.10 basis points to 2.081% after hitting 2.071%, their lowest level since September 2017. Ten-year yields were set for their biggest two-day fall in just over a year. Two-year yields declined 10.20 basis points to 1.842%. They touched 1.838% earlier Monday, which was their lowest since December 2017. Two-year yields were on track for their biggest two-day fall since October 2008 when they declined by nearly 35 basis points. Shorter-dated yields have tumbled on a growing conviction that the Fed would lower key rates more than once before year-end to stave off a recession. RATE-CUT BETS GROWING St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said on Monday a rate cut may be \"warranted soon\" due to global trade risks and weak domestic inflation. In what is widely accepted as a recession signal, 10-year yields have been firmly below three-month note yields . The inversion in the yield curve has become more pronounced and steepened at one point on Monday at 27 basis points, the deepest since 2007. Interest rate futures traders are now pricing in a 60% chance of a rate cut at the Fed\u2019s July 30-31 meeting, up from 18% a week ago, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch program. They implied a 82% chance of another rate cut at the Fed's December meeting, up from 30% a week ago. Still it might be too early for the Fed to cut rates this summer. \"The bond market is a bit over-excited,\" said TD's Goldberg. \"We have not yet seen trade (risk) has spilled over enough into the real economy.\" Monday, June 3, at 1500 EDT (1900 GMT): Price Change US T BONDS SEP9 154-20\/32 29\/32 10YR TNotes SEP9 127-72\/256 17\/32 Price Current Net Yield % Change (bps) Three-month bills 2.29 2.3346 -0.019 Six-month bills 2.245 2.308 -0.047 Two-year note 100-141\/256 1.8417 -0.102 Three-year note 100-238\/256 1.7994 -0.096 Five-year note 100-186\/256 1.8469 -0.082 Seven-year note 101-8\/256 1.9663 -0.067 10-year note 102-160\/256 2.0814 -0.061 30-year bond 106-220\/256 2.5462 -0.037 YIELD CURVE Last (bps) Net Change (bps) 10-year vs 2-year yield 23.80 3.05 30-year vs 5-year yield 69.80 4.40 DOLLAR SWAP SPREADS Last (bps) Net Change (bps) U.S. 2-year dollar swap 4.00 -0.50 spread U.S. 3-year dollar swap 1.00 -0.75 spread U.S. 5-year dollar swap -0.50 -0.25 spread U.S. 10-year dollar swap -4.50 0.50 spread U.S. 30-year dollar swap -28.25 -0.25 spread (Reporting by Sujata Rao and Virginia Furness in LONDON Editing by Nick Zieminski and Chizu Nomiyama)","112":"March 19 (Reuters) - Fedex Corp:  * FEDEX CORP - ANNOUNCES LAUNCH OF FEDEX RETURNS TECHNOLOGY Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Reuters.Brief@thomsonreuters.com)","113":"LOS ANGELES\/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Amazon.com AMZN.O is launching a new fleet of bigger, boxier trucks like those favored by rival package carriers United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N and FedEx Corp FDX.N, as it fights to fix widespread pandemic-fueled delivery delays that sent customers into the arms of competitors like Walmart Inc WMT.N.

FedEx, which is in the throes of a record-setting winter holiday shipping season, launched a new cost-cutting campaign after its Express revenues took a hit. On Dec. 7, FedEx announced that the CEO of its Express unit was retiring at year-end.  Executives noted a sharp UK slowdown due to Brexit uncertainty, Germany\u2019s recent gross domestic product contraction, protests in France that threaten to spread to nearby countries and a cooling down in Asia.  FedEx is seen as a bellwether for the global economy and its results sparked concern that the United States may catch the \u201ccold\u201d affecting other regions, said Trip Miller, managing partner at Memphis-based Gullane Capital.  \u201cThis confirms a lot of market fears ... and is probably why the (stock) market has been off so much,\u201d said Miller.

FedEx Chief Executive Fred Smith said politics fueled much of the world\u2019s economic turmoil and that policy changes can turn it around.  The tempered outlook landed as FedEx grapples with ongoing margin pressure at its Express and Ground units and speculation that Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O will attack its own mounting transportation costs with a competing delivery network - a concept CEO Smith described as \"fantastical.\"  Its new forecast assumes moderate U.S. domestic economic growth and no further weakening in international economic conditions, FedEx said.

Otto said on Wednesday Hermes has seen parcel volumes soar in Germany and Britain in April to levels usually seen in the run-up to Christmas.

The profit warning and weak quarterly results have resulted in a slew of price target cuts, with Morgan Stanley cutting to $148 from $156, as the full year forecast cut was much bigger than expected and implied a tough fourth quarter.  In December, FedEx had slashed its forecast, citing a sharp downturn in worldwide trade, and now expects to earn between $15.10 and $15.90 per share this year.

The company said it did not think it was appropriate to subject Hong Kong-based crew members to extended periods of isolation, preventing them from seeing their families after finishing a trip.  \u201cWhile we don\u2019t know what the rule will state, when it will precisely take effect, or how long it will last, we do not want unknowns to prevent us from taking action on what we understand may likely occur,\u201d FedEx System Chief Pilot Robin Sebasco said in the memo seen by Reuters, which was first reported by the South China Morning Post on Thursday.  A FedEx spokeswoman said it was developing steps to comply with potential quarantine measures in a way that prioritised the safety and well-being of staff while allowing it to continue to operate to Hong Kong.  The memo said the company would cover hotel costs and out-of-pocket expenses for pilots and their families in San Francisco, while continuing to pay their housing allowances in Hong Kong.  However, a Hong Kong-based FedEx pilot said on condition of anonymity that there were flaws in the plan. Many pilots have children in school in Hong Kong, he said, and regardless, it will be difficult for families to live in hotel rooms for weeks or months at a time.  Hong Kong\u2019s biggest airline, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, on Monday warned passenger capacity could fall by 60%, cargo capacity by 25% and cash burn would rise if the new quarantine arrangements were put in place.

Operating margin in the FedEx Ground segment tumbled to 6.4% from 11.5% a year ago, largely related to the cost of adding Sunday, or 7-day, delivery.  At Express, its plane-focused fast delivery service, operating margin fell to 2.6% from 6.6% a year ago, after weak industrial production contributed to softness in its higher-profit commercial business.  In September, FedEx lowered its earnings forecast for the year ending May 2020, to $11 to $13 per share. On Tuesday, it cut that to $10.25 to $11.50 per share, citing missed revenue targets in all transportation segments and higher residential delivery costs.  This holiday season is six days shorter than last year, pressuring package delivery firms at a time when retailers are demanding speedier deliveries.

FILE PHOTO: The Federal Reserve building is pictured in Washington, DC, U.S., August 22, 2018. REUTERS\/Chris Wattie\/File Photo  Thursday marked the third straight day in which the federal funds policy rate traded at its effective ceiling of 2.20 percent. Before this week, the policy rate had approached but never landed on the rate the Fed pays banks on excess reserves (IOER), activated in 2015 to keep the policy rate contained.  The policy rate has drifted higher in its range throughout the year, causing the Fed in June to tweak the IOER lower. To provide a buffer, it now sits 0.05 percent below the upper end of the overall policy range of 2.00-2.25 percent.  The upward drift has renewed a debate over whether the Fed's reduction of its massive bond holdings, which started a year ago, has made it more expensive for banks to borrow excess reserves to meet regulatory requirements or fund their daily needs. (Graphic: Bank excess reserves held at the Fed - tmsnrt.rs\/2Jh0PPN)  Reserves have fallen more quickly than the Fed\u2019s portfolio, leading some in the market to believe a scarcity is behind the upward creep in the policy rate, and that the portfolio trimming would have to stop soon. That, in turn, could leave the Fed with a more accommodative policy stance overall.  \u201cIf one thought that the drift higher in the funds rate were the result of growing scarcity of reserves in the interbank market, then it would signal to the Fed a need to slow or stop pulling reserves out of the banking system via their balance sheet normalization,\u201d wrote Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan.  He added, however, that there was so far \u201clittle evidence that reserves are becoming scarce.\u201d  Central bankers agree.  Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester discussed the issue twice over two days of events in New York, telling investors on Thursday that a series of other one-off factors was driving the policy rate\u2019s upward drift, including the supply of fed funds from government-sponsored home-loan banks.  Another downward tweak to the IOER, to provide more of a buffer, \u201cwouldn\u2019t bother me,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can think about that separately from\u201d the ultimate size of the balance sheet and longer-term operating framework, Mester added.  Hours later, at a conference on Friday at the Bank of France in Paris, the Fed official running market operations argued that even if the effective policy rate rose above IOER, it would not signal reserves scarcity. At any rate, it was unrelated to any future decision on how much to shrink the current $4 trillion in bonds on the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, said Simon Potter, executive vice president at the New York Fed.  \u201cLet me be clear: observing the (policy rate) and other rates above the (IOER) is not a sufficient condition for reserve scarcity,\u201d Potter said at the conference.  The Fed bought some $3.5 trillion in bonds to spur recovery from recession in the last decade, leaving it with a total of $4.5 trillion in overall assets as of October last year.  Since then, it has shed some $250 billion, even as bank reserves have dropped by more than twice that value. The Fed has never specified how much it wants to trim its asset holdings.","127":"FILE PHOTO: A FedEx truck is driven through downtown in Los Angeles, California, U.S., July 22, 2019.

FedEx shares are on course for their biggest one-day percentage drop since 2008.  J.P. Morgan was the most aggressive in slashing its price target by $22, saying growth at the company\u2019s Express business, the largest unit, was taking a hit from delays in integration of TNT Express, a Dutch delivery company it acquired in 2016 for $4.8 billion.  A bellwether of the global economy and the broader logistics sector, FedEx has been battling the costly and lengthy integration that it expects to complete by 2021 at an estimated cost of about $1.7 billion.  Credit Suisse, which cut its price target for the stock to $168 from $175, said barring an outright recession, the numbers are nearly de-risked with the potential for a reacceleration in earnings growth in FY21.  \u201cThis is a transition year... we believe earnings should recover in FY21, and would obviously improve sooner if there were a trade deal between the US and China,\u201d Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a note.  Some analysts also second the company\u2019s view that elimination of the Amazon contract would eventually result in margin improvement.  \u201cAmazon contracts represented only a small proportion of our revenues, the nature of our businesses is such that near-term profits will be adversely affected since the last bit of volume has significant flow-through to the bottom line,\u201d Chief Executive Frederick Smith said on Tuesday.  In June, FedEx ended its contract with Amazon.com Inc for U.S. cargo delivery through FedEx Express, as it focuses on moving the service in-house.  The recent breakup could help rival United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N, which counts Amazon as a customer, handle more holiday packages for the e-commerce company.  FedEx now expects adjusted earnings to fall between 16% and 29% for full-year 2020 ending May 31, compared with its June estimate of a mid-single slide.  Analysts on average had expected a profit of $14.69 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES estimates.  Additionally, FedEx said it would initiate a new round of cost cuts - including reducing services in its global FedEx Express air network after the holiday season. It also will retire and ground dozens of planes.","129":"July 23 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc next year will join rival FedEx Corp in adding Sunday delivery services, efforts viewed as bids to fend off customer-turned-competitor Amazon.com Inc.

Research firm eMarketer expects global online sales to hit $6.25 trillion in 2023 - up 560% from 2013.  \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a room for a third\u201d major shipper, said Cathy Morrow Roberson, founder of Logistics Trends & Insights, who added that the UPS-FedEx duopoly keeps U.S. prices high.  The average cost of shipping a U.S. parcel was $9.51 in 2018, versus $1.81 in China and $5.26 in Germany, according to the Pitney Bowes Parcel Shipping Index.  The dominant U.S. carriers are getting squeezed as Amazon competition lowers rates and e-commerce pushes up some costs. Online orders cost more to handle than business packages because they are often far-flung, one-off residential deliveries. The physical breadth of the United States also means costs could remain higher than in other countries.  Amazon so far is reserving lower-cost urban deliveries for its in-house service, while handing rural packages to carriers. The density of urban environments means costs per package are lower than rural routes.  UPS has some leverage because its unified delivery network is more efficient than the split FedEx Express and Ground networks. But, UPS depends on Amazon for 11.6% of its revenue.  \u201cAs with any customer, there\u2019s no such thing as unattractive freight, just unattractive pricing, so it will be up to UPS to make a decent return on this growing customer,\u201d Stifel analyst David Ross said in a client note.  Amazon\u2019s use of inexpensive independent contractors and e-commerce dominance give it the ability to negotiate hard.  Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx broke up with Amazon over the summer, giving up about 1% of its revenue. UPS\u2019s U.S. Next Day Air business scooped up much of that volume - and saw a 9.2% drop in revenue per package for 2019.  UPS\u2019s unionized workforce - and its dependence on Amazon business - leaves it particularly exposed to competition from the Seattle company\u2019s rising logistics unit.  \u201cThat will be a bigger hit to UPS than FedEx,\u201d Roberson said.","133":"(Reuters) - FedEx Corp FDX.N warned on Tuesday that full-year earnings would miss analysts' estimates, as the U.S.-China trade war exacerbates a global economic cooling and the company manages fallout from its split with customer-turned-competitor Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.

While FedEx has been grappling with its own challenges - particularly the costly and lengthy integration of its European TNT business - it is broadly seen as a bellwether for the global economy and the broader logistics sector.

With the peak holiday shipping season fast-approaching, global package delivery giant FedEx Corp is paying retirement-age pilots bonuses of $40,000 - and potentially as much as $110,000 - to keep them flying into next year, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter and a contract seen by Reuters.  The bonuses, outlined in the latest pilot contract and previously unreported, reveal that a wave of pilot retirements, global pilot shortages and rising cargo demand fueled by the growth of global e-commerce are straining the world\u2019s largest air delivery fleet.  Any problem in maintaining capacity for FedEx, which many economists consider a barometer of U.S. economic strength, disrupts supply chains at a time when they are already being destabilized by international trade tensions.  FedEx and rival United Parcel Service Inc, which is trying to recruit hundreds of pilots this year but is not paying bonuses, play a crucial role in global supply chains from aerospace to retail, particularly during the holidays when average daily delivery volumes can double.  FedEx spokeswoman Bonny Harrison declined to comment on pilot pay or its use of bonuses to manage the timing of retirements. She did point to details of a pilot recruitment campaign it launched publicly in April and said FedEx had about 5,000 aviators on its payroll.  \u201cFedEx Express is well staffed with pilots at this time, however we\u2019re always looking toward the future,\u201d Harrison said.  Two senior FedEx managers familiar with the strategy told Reuters the company offered cash bonuses to retain retiring pilots through the holiday shipping surge that stretches from the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday in November through year-end.  FedEx and UPS had record holiday peak business in 2016 and 2017, and plan to hire a total of 155,000 temporary workers for the peak season to help to deliver products bought from retailers like Amazon.com Inc, Walmart Inc and Best Buy Co Inc to consumers\u2019 doorsteps.  The National Retail Federation expects 2018 U.S. holiday retail sales in November and December to increase as much as 4.8 percent to $720.89 billion compared with a year ago.  FedEx expects to lose about 150-200 of its roughly 5,000 pilots this year - and around the same number annually for the foreseeable future - as more approach age 65, the federally mandated pilot retirement age, one of the sources said.  The FedEx pilot contract seen by Reuters, signed in late 2015, includes a calculation that allows for bonuses of up to $110,000 per pilot. The two sources told Reuters they were aware of pilots collecting bonuses this year of $40,000 to $50,000, though the total number of payouts was unclear.  These bonuses are calculated based on a portion of a pilot\u2019s salary over the 24 months prior to his or her retirement date, the contract says. To get the bonus, a pilot has to provide at least 12 months\u2019 notice of the day he or she will retire on Dec. 31 of a given future year.  Flying for FedEx is the highest-paying job among U.S. carriers, with 30-year pilots making roughly $300,000 not counting overtime or bonuses, industry sources said.  For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs\/2NVcZoB  \u2018ALREADY FEELING IT\u2019  The bonuses are the latest sign of fallout from a global pilot shortage, which is already squeezing the operations of passenger airlines and now pressuring FedEx as it looks to cash in on the revival of the global air cargo market after a prolonged slump.  Each day, roughly a third of global trade by value - or about $17.5 billion worth of products from smartphones and televisions to wine and vaccines - travel by air, according to the International Air Transport Association, a lobby group.  Both FedEx and UPS ordered billions of dollars worth of Boeing Co freighters earlier this year in a move to modernize their fleets and meet rising demand.  Last November, FedEx also ordered 80 new turboprops for its smaller partners - known as \u201cfeeder\u201d airlines - that carry packages from major facilities like its \u201cSuperHub\u201d at Memphis International Airport to smaller cities or rural areas where widebody jets do not fly.  Not having enough pilots means not flying jetliners as often as business plans dictate, or moving more freight by slower or costlier means, like ship or truck.  Dallas, Texas-based Ameriflight, one such feeder airline for FedEx and UPS, is taking matters into its own hands after its pilot headcount fell this year beneath the number of planes in its fleet.  While trying to recruit new pilots through social media and paid advertising, Ameriflight spokeswoman Jamie Smith said that packed pilot schedules in recent months have forced it, on occasion, to pay for costlier charter flights or reject FedEx cargo. This forces FedEx to find another carrier or send freight by truck, which takes longer.  \u201c(FedEx and UPS) are already feeling it on our end,\u201d Smith said.  RECRUITMENT CAMPAIGNS  Separate from the pilot bonuses, FedEx launched the \u201cPurple Runway\u201d program in April to bulk up its ranks, recruiting college graduates with pilot licenses for jobs with its feeder airlines.  The goal is \u201cto ensure a full pipeline of pilots for us and the industry at large,\u201d FedEx Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith told an audience in March at Mississippi\u2019s Delta State University, the first school in the program. The speech and the program were not reported by national media.  UPS has a similar recruitment program dubbed \u201cFlightPath\u201d and was working to recruit between 200-300 pilots this year, but is so far not paying bonuses, a spokesman said.  The pilot shortage is worsening as major U.S. trucking firms - including FedEx and UPS fleets - are already grappling with a chronic truck driver shortage that has raised shipping costs and hurt profits across corporate America.  Trip Miller, Managing Partner at Memphis-based Gullane Capital Partners, a long-time FedEx shareholder, said the pilot shortage will hit FedEx hardest in about 3-to-5 years.  \u201cWe live in a world where 2-day delivery is becoming much more the norm,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThe pilot shortage doesn\u2019t mean \u2018we won\u2019t be able to get your cargo from point A to point B\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019ll mean \u2018we can\u2019t get your packages there as quickly or, if we do, you\u2019re going to pay more.\u2019\u201d","135":"FILE PHOTO: A FedEx delivery truck is seen in New York City, December 16, 2010.REUTERS\/Mike Segar  (Reuters) - A federal judge in New York dismissed a lawsuit on Wednesday against FedEx Corp FDX.N in which New York state and New York City claimed that the package delivery company had shipped untaxed cigarettes, cheating both out of tax revenue, according to a court document.

(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles Editing by Phil Berlowitz)","138":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday brought its three-year drive to tighten monetary policy to an abrupt end, abandoning projections for any interest rate hikes this year amid signs of an economic slowdown, and saying it would halt the steady decline of its balance sheet in September.  The measures, announced following the end of a two-day policy meeting, mean the Fed\u2019s gradual and sometimes fitful efforts to return monetary policy to a more normal footing will stop well short of what was foreseen in late 2015 when the central bank first moved rates from the near-zero level adopted in response to the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.  Having downgraded their U.S. growth, unemployment and inflation forecasts, policymakers said the Fed\u2019s benchmark overnight interest rate, or fed funds rate, was likely to remain at the current level of between 2.25 percent and 2.50 percent at least through this year, a wholesale shift of their outlook.  Rates are now seen peaking at 2.6 percent, sometime in 2020, roughly a percentage point lower than the historic average for the fed funds rate and a sign that the U.S. economy has entered a more sluggish era.  In contrast to projections through much of last year, Fed policymakers no longer see the need to move rates to a \u201crestrictive\u201d level as a guard against inflation, which remains lodged below the central bank\u2019s 2 percent target.  They also said that as of May they would slow their monthly reduction of as much as $50 billion in asset holdings, and halt them altogether in September, ending what amounted to a second lever of monetary tightening that had run in the background since late 2017.  (GRAPHIC: Federal Reserve bond holdings since the financial crisis - tmsnrt.rs\/2HDf8BV)  In terms of interest rates, the new Fed projections knocked the number of hikes expected this year to zero from the two forecast in December, completing a pivot to a less aggressive policy in the face of an apparent jump in economic risks. At least nine of the Fed\u2019s 17 policymakers reduced their outlook for the fed funds rate, a comparatively large number.  \u201cIt may be some time before the outlook for jobs and inflation calls clearly for a change in policy ,\u201d Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in a press conference following the policy meeting, at which policymakers reaffirmed they will be \u201cpatient\u201d before moving rates again.  \u201cPatient means that we see no need to rush to judgment,\u201d Powell said.  Continued growth and a healthy jobs market remains \u201cthe most likely\u201d scenario for the U.S. economy, the Fed\u2019s rate-setting committee said in a policy statement on Wednesday.  But doubts have accumulated, with a slowdown in household spending and business investment at the start of this year possibly signaling an early end to a growth spurt triggered in 2018 by a massive tax cut package and government spending.  The economic projections released on Wednesday showed policymakers at the median see the U.S. economy growing only 2.1 percent in 2019, a full percentage point below the roughly 3 percent growth that was seen in 2018 and which the Trump administration contends will continue.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  \u2018MORE DOVISH\u2019  The new rate view brings the Fed in line with investors who have argued the central bank would not raise rates this year.  \u201cI didn\u2019t think they\u2019d do it, but they came across as more dovish than what was expected,\u201d said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist for Wells Fargo Asset Management.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  The outlook is now also in line with President Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of Fed rate hikes as endangering the recovery, though for the awkward reason that Fed officials do not see his policies having a lasting impact on growth.  Fed funds futures contracts began pricing in a better-than-even chance of a rate cut by next year after the release of the policy statement and projections.  Powell pushed back on that view, saying the U.S. economy is in a \u201cgood place\u201d and that the outlook is \u201cpositive.\u201d  Still, he said, there are ongoing risks, including those related to Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, U.S. trade talks with China, and even the outlook for the U.S. economy, which he said the Fed is watching closely.  \u201cThe data are not currently sending a signal that we need to move in one direction or another, in my view,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great time for us to be patient.\u201d  Benchmark U.S. stock market indexes swung higher after the Fed\u2019s statement was released before giving up the gains later in the trading session, and key Treasury security yields dropped to the lowest levels since early January. The dollar weakened broadly against major trading partners\u2019 currencies.  \u201cThe Fed exceeded markets\u2019 dovish expectations, which took a toll on the greenback,\u201d said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. \u201cThe Fed did a big about-face on policy. The fact that the Fed threw in the towel on a 2019 rate hike was particularly dovish.\u201d  The new economic projections showed weakening on all fronts compared to the Fed\u2019s forecasts from December. In addition to the growth slowdown, the unemployment rate for 2019 is forecast at 3.7 percent, slightly higher than forecast three months ago.  Inflation for the year is now seen at 1.8 percent, compared to the December forecast of 1.9 percent.  \u201cGrowth of economic activity has slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter,\u201d the Fed said. \u201cRecent indicators point to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter ... overall inflation has declined.\u201d","139":"SEATTLE\/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Santa\u2019s sleigh cannot fly without its pilot.

But the former CEO of Europe\u2019s leading business software group SAP resisted suggestions from Lynch\u2019s defense lawyer in London\u2019s High Court that the acquisition of Autonomy was central to a desperate strategy.  \u201cUnstructured data was at the center of your plans,\u201d Robert Miles QC, acting for Lynch, told Apotheker, who was called as a witness in the case.  \u201cNo, that\u2019s not right, it was part of the plan,\u201d Apotheker said, adding that HP had considered buying either Autonomy or German group Software AG in the first half of 2011, but decided on the British firm because it would provide the \u201ctechnological uplift\u201d that HP wanted.  It was not clear cut, Apotheker said:  \u201cLooking at financial markets, investors, I think they would have preferred Software AG,\u201d he said.  Apotheker who said in his witness statement that he had \u201cnever told the due diligence team to prioritize due diligence of Autonomy\u2019s technology over its financials\u201d, also rejected the idea that HP was in crisis.  \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t doing well. I was very unhappy with the results but that doesn\u2019t mean the company was about to go under.\u201d  HP is suing Lynch, once hailed as Britain\u2019s answer to Bill Gates, along with his former finance chief Sushovan Hussain for more than $5 billion. Lynch also faces criminal fraud charges in the United States, which carry a maximum term of 20 years. Hussain has been convicted of fraud in a related U.S. case.  ONLY SOFTWARE  At the opening of the case last week, HP\u2019s lawyer Laurence Rabinowitz QC said the U.S. company believed it was buying a fast-growing software firm with no hardware business.  Apotheker recalled that Lynch told him Autonomy was a \u201cvery focused\u201d pure software company when they first met in Palo Alton, California, in April 2011.  He said he understood that to mean Autonomy\u2019s strategy was driven by \u201csoftware and software only\u201d.  HP argues that covertly selling hardware was one of the ways that Autonomy inflated its revenue, while Lynch\u2019s lawyers have said it was commercially justified.  Apotheker was replaced by Meg Whitman, who planned to refocus the company on its core hardware strengths after an outcry from shareholders over the new strategy and a steep decline in HP\u2019s share price.  Hewlett Packard Company in 2015 split into two separate publicly traded companies - HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.  Whitman is expected to be called as a witness later in the trial, while Lynch himself is expected to appear around July.  The case is expected to last until the end of the year.","142":"FedEx Ground Package Delivery System Inc has agreed to pay $3.3 million to more than 220 deaf and hard-of-hearing workers who the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claimed were turned down for jobs or denied accommodations in violation of federal law.

The package delivery industry is widely seen as a bellwether for the global economy.  \u201cSlowing international macroeconomic conditions and weaker global trade growth trends continue,\u201d FedEx Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf said in a statement on Tuesday.  Executives also blamed the results on the cost of launching year-round, six-days-per-week operations at FedEx Ground in the United States and continued weakness in its international Express business, which includes former Dutch delivery company TNT Express.  FedEx bought that struggling business in 2016 for $4.8 billion and has had difficulties integrating it into its own network.  FedEx expects integration costs to exceed $1.5 billion and said in a regulatory filing that it will complete a project allowing packages to flow between the FedEx Express and TNT Express networks by the end of 2020, more than four years after acquiring the Dutch delivery company.  Adding to those challenges, a 2017 cyberattack on TNT\u2019s European technology systems cost FedEx some $300 million to fix and sent a number of high-value, time-sensitive customers into the arms of stronger operators in Europe.  \u201cIt\u2019s cutthroat over there,\u201d said Cathy Morrow Roberson, founder of consulting firm Logistics Trends & Insights. \u201cFedEx Express has some serious problems.\u201d  Germany\u2019s Deutsche Post DHL earlier this month said it saw no noticeable signs of a slowdown on the horizon, adding that its broad geographic and operational base would make it resilient even if global economic growth weakened.

FedEx now expects to earn $15.10 to $15.90 for the 2019 fiscal year ended May 31. Analysts had predicted full-year fiscal 2019 earnings per share of $15.97, on average.

The package delivery company\u2019s adjusted net income dropped 53.5% year-over-year to $371 million, or $1.41 per share, for the fiscal third quarter ended Feb. 29. Revenue rose about 3% to $17.5 billion.  Analysts on average expected earnings of $1.41 per share and revenue of $16.89 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.  The company - whose rivals include United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N and Amazon's homegrown delivery operation - was grappling with the integration of its TNT Express unit, higher costs related to launching Sunday home delivery, and the loss of Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O as a customer before the deadly virus outbreak began.  Executives see opportunity in surging e-commerce spending as governments in Europe and the United States urge people to hunker down at home to reduce the spread of the virus.

FILE PHOTO: A FedEx delivery worker carries a package for a delivery in Wilmette, Illinois, October 27, 2015. REUTERS\/Jim Young\/File Photo  FedEx, like global rival United Parcel Service Inc, is investing billions of dollars to cope with the boom in low-margin residential deliveries, which account for just over half of total package volume versus 20 percent in 2000.  Taking small numbers of packages the \u201clast mile\u201d to shoppers\u2019 doorsteps and far-flung homes is more costly than delivering scads of envelopes and packages to office buildings - the latter of which has been the Memphis-based company\u2019s bread and butter.  A typical residential delivery costs FedEx and UPS $1.60 more than a commercial delivery. They have surcharges to help cover the extra expense, but retailers are pushing back as they work to lower the cost of ever-faster - and still free - shipping, said Satish Jindel, founder of ShipMatrix.  The lower-cost, part-time drivers will use company vehicles, receive no benefits, work no more than four weekly shifts, and be paid $17.10 per hour in most markets - including Paducah, Kentucky; Roswell, New Mexico; and Jacksonville, Florida. Pay was highest, $19.66 per hour, in Kodiak, Alaska, according to a Reuters review of help wanted ads targeting 139 small to midsize cities in 31 states.  FedEx declined to give details on pay for the new employees or existing Express drivers.  FedEx and UPS traditionally have offered some of the industry\u2019s most desirable jobs.  FedEx Express employs more than 40,000 U.S. couriers. One person familiar with the hiring push said Express\u2019 non-union drivers make about $24 per hour and receive full benefits. Glassdoor.com put the average hourly pay at $18-$32.  UPS\u2019 unionized drivers make $20.50-$37.45, and the average total compensation for UPS small package drivers is $145,000 a year, a spokesman said.  FedEx said the part-time job category creates a group of flexible employees to supplement its existing workforce.  \u201cThis will allow us to handle fluctuations in volume by day of the week or hour of the day,\u201d FedEx said in an email.  Some experts called the effort a response to Amazon, which uses an army of on-demand \u201cFlex\u201d delivery drivers who make $18-25 per hour, get no benefits, and use their own cars to drop off packages. Those low-cost gig workers help open up Amazon\u2019s delivery markets. They also handle overflow and re-deliveries from the independent van owners that Amazon hires for daily routes.  \u201cIt sounds to me like they\u2019re moving toward the gig economy,\u201d John Haber, chief executive of consultancy Spend Management Experts, said of FedEx Express.  The project comes as Don Colleran - who was appointed CEO of FedEx Express in March - works to turn around the division now grappling with higher-than-expected costs related to integrating its European TNT Express business, a cooling global economy, and margin-squeezing e-commerce growth.  Haber and other consultants said the new part-time drivers could support FedEx Express\u2019 \u201cExtra Hours\u201d service that allows retailers like Walmart Inc to fulfill online orders into the evening for next-day local delivery.  \u201cThey\u2019ve got a ton of Walmart business. If these drivers are rural, this fits the Walmart model,\u201d Haber said.  Others said the move takes FedEx in the wrong direction.  \u201cThey should be downsizing the Express network, not expanding it,\u201d said Jindel, who is advocating for FedEx to merge Express with its more efficient North American Ground operation that outsources delivery to a network of independent providers.  \u201cWhy don\u2019t they use their Ground contractors to deliver (those packages) for them?\u201d said Jindel, who helped found Roadway Package System (RPS), which was rebranded as FedEx Ground in 2000 - two years after FedEx bought its parent company.  Meanwhile, FedEx Ground is working to ring out more residential profits by shifting the delivery of nearly 2 million SmartPost packages from and the U.S. Postal Service mail carriers to its own drivers. That should lower costs by increasing the number of parcels dropped at every stop.  Atlanta-based UPS operates one network in the United States and is more profitable than FedEx - even though residential deliveries make up 47% of its volume versus 25% at FedEx, according to ShipMatrix.  Shares in UPS slipped 0.4% in afternoon trading, while FedEx was down 1.3%.  UPS is not likely to replicate FedEx Express\u2019 strategy any time soon.  \u201cWe do not use part-time drivers outside of the period specified in our contract with the Teamsters, which includes periods around the peak holiday season,\u201d UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara said.","147":"LOS ANGELES\/NEW YORK (Reuters) - FedEx Corp FDX.N reported fourth-quarter profit that beat Wall Street estimates on Tuesday, as revenues and operating margins increased in each of the company's operating units.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  While every U.S. package carrier is fighting to manage unexpected demand for home deliveries of bicycles, patio furniture, medicine and food, FedEx entered the pandemic in turnaround mode and is grappling with an inflexible business structure that is contributing to service disruptions in California and Michigan.  FedEx reports quarterly results after the market close on Tuesday.  Reuters could not immediately determine whether it is suffering similar delays in other states.  For two Mondays in a row, FedEx told San Bernardino, California-based Pacific Mountain Logistics it would not make scheduled Ground pickups until Thursday, Chief Executive B.J. Patterson said.  The delay is not limited to FedEx\u2019s Ground division that focuses on e-commerce packages. Service at FedEx Express - which caters mostly to business deliveries - also is affected, said Patterson, who has been a FedEx customer for a decade.  In an email viewed by Reuters, a FedEx Services account representative cited a \u201clack of equipment\u201d and a \u201cbacklog\u201d at the delivery company\u2019s Rialto, California, hub.  A corporate spokeswoman, who did not elaborate on the reasons for the delays, said FedEx Ground is experiencing holiday \u201cpeak-like levels\u201d of residential demand.  \u201cAll these guys got caught flat-footed with the volume increase,\u201d Patterson said, referring to pandemic package surges at U.S. delivery firms.  \u201cI get it. But to not be able to handle it for almost a week, that\u2019s a little insane,\u201d said Patterson, who is moving some shipments to UPS.  The volume surge also is causing \u201csignificant\u201d FedEx Ground delays in parts of Michigan, according company service alerts. Cathy Morrow Roberson, founder of consulting services at Logistics Trends & Insights, said it appears to have started in late May.  WDIV-TV reported that FedEx was addressing Detroit-area delays by hiring package handlers and drivers, and diverting packages from its Oak Park facility.  The pandemic is blurring the lines between FedEx's distinct Ground and Express businesses. It is also heaping additional operational challenges on company executives, who already were wrestling with last summer's split with Amazon.com AMZN.O, a major customer, and the problem-plagued TNT Express merger in Europe.  Business closures forced FedEx to reroute deliveries from shuttered offices to workers\u2019 homes, said Trevor Outman, founder of San Diego-based consultancy Shipware.  FedEx responded to the coronavirus spike by putting caps on the numbers of FedEx Ground packages customers could send. That prompted Patterson and others to shift some excess volume to the pricier Express network.  Over the years, FedEx got kudos for outsourcing costly Ground deliveries to lower-cost contractors. But now experts say the pandemic is highlighting the competitive advantage of UPS\u2019s single package network.  That unified model is more efficient and \u201callows UPS to manage unplanned volume better,\u201d said Dean Maciuba, a former FedEx executive.  Chase Flashman, CEO of consultancy ShipSights, said the disruptions open the door for UPS to woo FedEx customers, much in the way the 1997 UPS strike left an opening for FedEx.  \u201cThey\u2019re going to gain some market share,\u201d Flashman said of UPS. \u201cIt won\u2019t be a short-term shift.\u201d","152":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O will suspend a delivery service that aims to compete with UPS UPS.N and FedEx FDX.N in the United States.

Revenue slipped to $17.4 billion from $17.8 billion a year earlier.  Analysts, on average, expected a profit of $1.52 per share on revenue of $16.4 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.  FedEx said the novel coronavirus pandemic, which is leaving a trail of human and economic damage in its wake, hit virtually all of the company\u2019s revenue and expense line items. Executives declined to provide an earnings forecast for fiscal 2020, citing the uncertain timing and pace of an economic recovery.  FedEx is grappling with a flood of coronavirus-related e-commerce shipments as it rebuilds from its split with Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, a major customer, and the costly integration of TNT Express in Europe.  Business closures and a profound shift to online shopping are squeezing profits at FedEx and rival United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N. Residential e-commerce deliveries, which involve more miles per route and fewer packages per stop, are less lucrative than business deliveries where drivers leave anywhere from a handful to hundreds of pieces at each location.  FedEx total U.S. domestic residential volume was 72% for the fourth quarter, versus 56% a year earlier, FedEx Chief Marketing Officer Brie Carere said on a conference call with analysts  \u201cProfitability doesn\u2019t necessarily improve when you\u2019re sending more packages to far-flung places,\u201d Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold said of home deliveries.  FedEx Ground, which handles more e-commerce home deliveries, reported a 20% revenue increase for the quarter and a 17% drop in operating income.  Revenue at FedEx Express, which skews toward commercial deliveries, fell 10% and operating income dropped 56%.  FedEx executives said they were attacking residential delivery costs as business-to-business shipments begin to show signs of recovery.

Higher peak-related costs, integration costs of its Dutch TNT Express unit, bad weather, and other factors sapped profit by about $170 million year-over-year, FedEx said.  FedEx\u2019s results came the day a package bomb blew up at a FedEx distribution center near San Antonio, the fifth in a series of attacks that have rocked Texas this month.  FedEx Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith told analysts on a call following the results he was thankful there were no serious injuries and said FedEx has provided law enforcement \u201cextensive evidence from our advanced technology security systems.\u201d  FedEx reported its daily package volume were up 6 percent in the quarter, driven by demand during the peak holiday shipping season that begins after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday and lasts through year-end.  FedEx investments to expand capacity and choose higher-profit shipments, coupled with higher prices and volumes, paid off slightly as its Ground unit saw quarterly operating margins rise to 12.1 percent from 11 percent in the year-ago period.  Like its main rival, FedEx has spent billions of dollars on upgrading its network to handle rapidly rising deliveries of products ordered online, and investors were watching eagerly for evidence the investments were paying off.  FedEx lowered it 2018 capex spending forecast by $100 million to $5.8 billion. It said it placed a \"small order\" for Tesla Inc's TSLA.O forthcoming all-electric Semi that it would test for its Freight unit, and said it would add 500 Office locations inside Walmart Inc WMT.N stores over the next two years.  FedEx posted net income for the fiscal third quarter ended Feb. 28 of $2.07 billion, or $7.59 per diluted share, up from $562 million, or $2.07 per share, a year earlier.  Adjusted for one-time items, the company reported earnings per share of $3.72. Wall Street analysts had expected earnings per share of $3.11.  Revenue for the quarter was $16.5 billion, versus the $16.16 analysts expected.

FedEx shares fell 1.7 percent at mid-afternoon, making the stock the biggest drag on the Dow Jones Transport Average index , a gauge of economically sensitively stocks. The Dow transports were down 1.8 percent overall, declining more steeply than the 0.5 percent drop for the benchmark S&P 500 index.  Shares of FedEx rival, United Parcel Service Inc, were off 2 percent.  \u201cThey enable the trade between countries, so they are going to be hit more than domestically oriented companies,\u201d Jairam Nathan, an analyst with Daiwa Capital Markets America, said of the package delivery stocks.  Amazon Inc\u2019s rollout on Tuesday of package delivery lockers for apartment dwellers also may have weighed on FedEx and UPS shares, an analyst said.  In the latest salvo between the world\u2019s two biggest economies on Tuesday, China accused the United States of \u201cextreme pressure and blackmailing\u201d and vowed to retaliate after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods.  Investors were looking for further insight into the fallout from the trade tensions when FedEx reports its fiscal fourth-quarter results after the market closes on Tuesday. Industrial companies overall have been a focal point for trade tensions, and the sector was down 2 percent on Tuesday.  FedEx is expected to post earnings per share of $5.71, a 34 percent rise from a year earlier, on revenue of $17.3 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  The company also may indicate any caution about the impact of an escalating trade dispute when it gives its outlook for its upcoming fiscal year. Analysts on average expect its earnings per share to rise by about 16 percent in fiscal 2019.  \u201cStrong pricing trends driven by demand for e-commerce and time sensitive delivery services should result in an upbeat (fiscal) outlook,\u201d Cowen & Co analyst Helane Becker said in a research note ahead of the results.  In its last quarterly report in March, FedEx Chief Executive Frederick Smith said the company was \u201cconcerned about the prospect of increased protectionist tariffs as history has shown repeatedly that protectionism is counterproductive to economic growth.\u201d  In a statement on Tuesday, a UPS spokesman said the company \u201cstands ready to help our customers no matter their needs for crossing borders or addressing trade complexities.\u201d  Trading in the options market suggested investors were bracing for more of a volatile stock reaction than in the past to FedEx results.  Options on FedEx implied a roughly 4.3 percent move for the shares in either direction by Friday, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert data. Over the last eight quarters, FedEx shares have, on average, moved 3.2 percent, the day after reporting results.

Law enforcement personnel investigate the surroundings of a house linked to the bomber in Pflugerville, Texas, U.S., March 21, 2018. REUTERS\/Loren Elliott  A three-week bombing spree, which sent a shiver through the Texas capital of Austin and rattled the rest of the country, raised fears about the possibility of other attackers via package delivery.  \u201cIn light of the bombings in Austin the FBI has reached out to our private-sector partners to remind them of established protocols of how to handle suspicious packages,\u201d Federal Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Lindsay Ram said by email.  There was no suggestion by the FBI that FedEx had not followed protocols to the letter.  Federal prosecutors said on Wednesday they had charged Mark Conditt of Pflugerville, Texas, with unlawful possession and transfer of a destructive device before he blew himself up as police closed in on his vehicle.  FedEx, United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N and other couriers collect a vast amount of data on packages in their systems. Some of the information may have helped identify the man who carried out the bombings, a FedEx executive said.  FedEx Chief Operations Officer David Bronczek told employees in an internal memo seen by Reuters that the company provided \u201ckey evidence\u201d to law enforcement officials on identifying the suspect.  The FBI\u2019s Ram did not elaborate on whether the agency was concerned about other deadly packages that may have slipped into a mail network that handles roughly 40 million parcels daily in the United States.  FedEx was taking the extraordinary step of screening every package at the sorting facility outside Austin where a parcel bomb exploded on a conveyor belt on Tuesday. It was also x-raying entire trailers filled with packages at that location and other trailers with packages originating from central Texas, a FedEx manager said.  FedEx spokesman Jim McCluskey declined to comment on package screening and on the evidence FedEx provided authorities.  Like FedEx, UPS shipping terms and conditions allow employees to open and inspect packages, and the companies train employees on how to respond if they see packages that look suspicious or may contain drugs.  FedEx and UPS have so far not described steps they may take to expand screening.  UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara said the company constantly evaluates and adjusts its security measures, but does not discuss them in order to maintain their effectiveness.  The United States Postal Service said in a statement that although it appeared none of the devices in Austin were sent through the U.S. mail, USPS reminded employees and customers to be observant about suspicious packages.  Inspectors in its Dangerous Mail Investigations Program \u201care trained to recognize the common characteristics of suspicious mail and are highly proficient in the use of state-of-the-art equipment to include portable X-ray machines,\u201d the USPS said.  The FedEx manager said in-bound international shipments are screened by x-ray or bomb-sniffing dogs, and said the Texas blast could lead to changes in domestic security screening.  Airport-like security measures inside package sorting facilities and retail locations would be a costly and unnecessary step that would paralyze operations, particularly given the rarity of package bombs, said Satish Jindel, a founder of the delivery company that became FedEx Ground.","162":"Sept 29 (Reuters) - Out with grimy microwaves and sticky coffee machines with worn-out buttons, in with stylus pens, QR codes, no-touch water coolers and mobile apps that pick what brew the machine will make for you.  From the headquarters of Ford in Dearborn, Michigan and Goldman Sachs in New York to Fedex facilities across the United States, workers are returning after months of lockdowns to the new reality of social distancing, hybrid remote and office work schedules, and strict hygiene protocols.  The break room, where employees used to get their daily fix of caffeine and office gossip, is a big part of that reboot as coffee companies, such as Keurig Dr. Pepper, Lavazza and Nestle roll out new technology for the COVID-19 era.  Nestle says it has worked with manufacturers to add a function to its coffeemakers that lets users to make a selection by just hovering a finger over the menu and has been delivering those to clients since June.  Lavazza lauched a new model in September that works with a mobile app to whip up those cappuccinos and lattes without having to touch the machine.  U.S. coffee machine manufacturer Bunn has chosen a different approach, retrofitting its machines with a QR code that lets users order drinks through a webpage.  Last year, supplying offices with beans and brewers was a $5.7 billion business in the United States alone, according to research firm Packaged Facts. Coffee companies, which saw lockdowns wipe out so-called professional sales that also include the hospitality industry, bet they can revive that business by addressing workers' and employers' concerns. (Interactive graphic on U.S. coffee office service sector sales here tmsnrt.rs\/36fUSlh.)  DASH FOR AN APP  Lavazza had a new brewer slated to debut at a trade show in May, but started redesigning it to add a touchless function when the pandemic struck in March, Bruce Williamson, vice president of innovation and marketing at Lavazza Professional said.  \u201cWe had to very quickly use the weeks (we had) preparing for an app.\u201d  Williamson said a survey of about 170 consumers across the United States Lavazza commissioned in August validated its decision. It showed 40% of employees expected to leave the building less often to get a drink and to rely more on office supplies, but were nervous about infection risks.  \u201cWhat they are telling us is... \u2018I\u2019m going to come back to the office but I\u2019m nervous about touching the machine\u2019.\u201d  Employers, suppliers and designers are also experimenting with a one-stop service that allows office workers to refuel without going outside, while those working remotely can do it from the comfort of their home.  K-cup pod maker Keurig is supplying coffee for \u2018mini-marts\u2019 set up to replace office cafeterias and offering fresh fruit, vegetables, dairy, meat, coffee and other staples. It has also signed deals with several companies that have classified K-cup pods and brewers essential work items and pay for their deliveries to staff working remotely, said Phil Drapeau, the company's general manager for the 'Away from Home' business.(Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/3cFKFzF)  Ford said more than 100,000 people out of its global workforce of 190,000 have returned to its facilities since May, but cafe service remains suspended and it offers pre-packaged meals and beverages instead. The carmaker is also testing onsite grocery kiosks selling locally sourced dairy, produce, and meal prep kits.  Goldman Sachs told Reuters that 15% of its New York workforce is back with standard precautions in place - mandatory masks in all areas except employee desks and limits on the number of people in conference rooms and common areas.  RETHINK AND RECALIBRATE  Surveys and official guidelines suggest offices will fill up only gradually and might even never return to pre-pandemic capacity.  GoodFirms, a Washington, D.C.-based research firm, said this month its international survey of 168 businesses showed nearly a third of workers had already returned and nearly 60% wanted to do so, but more than half remained concerned about their safety.  A makeover of office catering was important for addressing such concerns, says Alicia LeBeouf, marketing and retail strategy executive at food service company Canteen, which counts FedEx, Pinterest, Target and UPS among its clients.  Buffets and chefs preparing meals on demand are replaced by grab-and-go food stations at Verizon and UnitedHealth Group Inc; contactless coffee machines get rolled out at Microsoft Corp; fridges get pedal-operated doors at Mohawk Industries and individually wrapped plastic utensils replace cutlery.  At a FedEx facility Canteen has replaced all card payment terminals at its grab-and-go stations with Canteen\u2019s \u201cConnect & Pay\u201d app, which also shows which items are available and their nutritional information.  The layout also needs to change, says Tom Vecchione, workplace strategist at New York architecture firm Vocon. The company is knocking down doors and removing screens for its clients to create more spacious common areas that make social distancing easier while replacing chairs with stools to discourage people from lingering for too long.  Canteen\u2019s LeBeouf said employers were banking on workers coming back, but they would not be returning to the same office they left before the pandemic.  \u201cWe\u2019ve had to recalibrate and...rethink everything.\u201d","163":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - FedEx Corp FDX.N is expanding its retail business, FedEx Office, in the United States by adding 500 new locations within Walmart Inc WMT.N stores in the next two years.

Shippers, retailers and restaurants are experimenting with robots, drones and self-driving cars in a bid to use automation to drive down the high cost of delivering gadgets, groceries and even cups of coffee the \u201clast mile\u201d to consumer doorsteps.  FedEx is teaming up with DEKA Development & Research Corp, whose founder Dean Kamen invented the Segway stand-up scooter and iBot stair-climbing wheelchair, for its project.

Cameras and software help them detect and avoid obstacles as they roam sidewalks and roadways at a top speed of 10 miles (16 km) per hour.  The project must win approval in test cities, including the shipper\u2019s hometown of Memphis, and the first deliveries will be between FedEx office stores.  On average, more than 60 percent of merchants\u2019 customers live within three miles of a store location. FedEx said it is working with its partners, which also include AutoZone Inc and Target Corp, to determine if autonomous delivery to them is a viable option for fast, cheap deliveries.  The \u201clast mile\u201d to the home accounts for 50 percent or more of total package delivery costs. Restaurants pay third-party delivery companies like Uber Eats, DoorDash and GrubHub commissions of 10-30 percent per order.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Investors and companies are pouring millions of dollars into projects aimed at lowering those costs and overcoming regulatory hurdles. For safety reasons, many states want autonomous vehicles to have humans as emergency backup drivers.  Starship Technologies, which has raised more than $40 million in venture funding, last year deployed robots to deliver packages in the San Francisco Bay Area.  In January, it teamed up with French food service company Sodexo to take Starbucks, Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and Blaze Pizza orders to the 40,000 students at George Mason University\u2019s Fairfax, Virginia, campus. That service costs $1.99 per order.  Amazon.com is testing its own delivery robot dubbed \u201cScout\u201d.  FedEx rival United Parcel Service Inc is not testing robots - but like FedEx and Amazon, it is experimenting with drone deliveries.  Other tests include tie-ups between grocery seller Kroger Co and self-driving car startup Nuro, as well as DoorDash and General Motors Co\u2019s Cruise Automation.","165":"(Adds details on dry run delay, executive comment)  LOS ANGELES, Dec 10 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service and FedEx Corp plan to deliver millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines before holiday gifts - giving them VIP handling that includes GPS tracking, special labels and first-loaded status on planes and trucks.  The largest U.S. package delivery companies are partners in the federal government\u2019s Operation Warp Speed (OWS) vaccine program and each has specialized capabilities to handle fragile medical products - including Pfizer Inc\u2019s mRna vaccine that requires shipment at sub-Arctic temperatures.  \u201cWe\u2019re giving priority to all the vaccine shipments,\u201d Wesley Wheeler, president of the global healthcare unit at UPS, told the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science & Transportation on Thursday.  A panel of outside advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is meeting on Thursday to weigh whether to recommend that the agency authorize Pfizer\u2019s coronavirus vaccine for emergency use, one of the last steps before vaccinations could begin.  If the vaccine is approved, UPS will put Gold-level service labels, which are embedded with four radios, on every vaccine and dry ice shipment.  UPS GPS trackers will also provide temperature, light exposure and motion data, backing up sensors provided by Pfizer. All of that information will stream into command centers run by UPS and OWS.  \u201cWe have three ways of looking at the packages through the system,\u201d said Wheeler. \u201cWe are watching the packages all day long.\u201d  UPS will load the suitcase-sized vaccine packages onto planes and trucks first and give them special handling in hubs and sorting centers. The company also will inform drivers who are transporting vaccines, and provide security escorts.  Vaccine distribution could start just as the U.S. holiday shipping peak hits record-pandemic fueled e-commerce volumes.  Some experts are already warning that the number of packages tendered for delivery could be 5% greater than the capacity carriers have to handle them - resulting is as many as 700 million gifts not arriving on time.  UPS and FedEx executives said they are giving vaccines top priority and have reserved capacity for them.  Before vaccine deliveries start, UPS will deliver supplies needed to administer Pfizer inoculations - including diluent, mixing vials, needles, syringes, protective equipment for healthcare workers and COVID-19 vaccination record cards for vaccine recipients.  The delivery companies will split next-day Pfizer vaccine deliveries in the United States, and UPS will deliver the first dry ice refills needed to keep vaccine in Pfizer\u2019s suitcase-sized shipping boxes at minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94\u00b0F), Wheeler said.

The move came after FedEx reignited Chinese ire over its business practices when a package containing a Huawei phone sent to the United States was returned last week to its sender in Britain, in what FedEx said was an \u201coperational error.\u201d Fears that China would blacklist FedEx as a result sent its shares down 2.7 percent on Monday.  FedEx\u2019s suit and delivery error come against a backdrop of increasing tension between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. The United States and China have been engaged in a trade fight for nearly a year on issues such as tariffs, subsidies, technology, regulations and cyber security.  The U.S. Commerce Department has banned a number of Chinese firms in recent weeks from buying sensitive U.S. technology.  In court filings in the District of Columbia, FedEx said it should not be expected to enforce the export ban, and could not reasonably be held liable for shipping products that it did not know about.  Export restriction rules \u201cessentially deputize FedEx to police the contents of the millions of packages it ships daily even though doing so is a virtually impossible task, logistically, economically, and in many cases, legally,\u201d it said in a filing.  A U.S. Commerce Department spokesman responded that, \u201cWe have not yet reviewed the complaint, but nevertheless look forward to defending Commerce\u2019s role in protecting U.S. national security.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: A Federal Express truck makes its way down a freeway in San Diego, California August 22, 2014. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Chinese telecoms company Huawei Technologies Co in May was added to the U.S. \u201cEntity List\u201d of people and companies the government said posed a risk to the United States, essentially barring it from buying U.S. technology upon which it was heavily reliant.  China is also drawing up its own \u201cUnreliable Entities List\u201d of foreign firms, groups and individuals.  State-run newspaper Global Times on Sunday tweeted that FedEx was likely to be added to that list.  \u2018OPERATIONAL ERROR\u2019  Last month, China said it would launch an investigation after two parcels sent via FedEx destined for Huawei addresses in Asia were diverted to the United States. FedEx said the packages were \u201cmisrouted in error.\u201d  In the latest incident, technology news outlet PCMag here said that its writer in Britain had attempted to send a Huawei P30 handset to a colleague in the United States. FedEx returned the phone and told the sender that it could not deliver the package because of a \"U.S. government issue\" with Huawei and the Chinese government, PCMag reported.  FedEx responded by saying publicly that it would deliver all products made by Huawei to addresses other than those of Huawei and affiliates placed on the U.S. national security blacklist.  FedEx rival United Parcel Service Inc also confirmed it would not ship to Huawei addresses on the Entity List but had no \u201cgeneral ban\u201d on Huawei products.  A Huawei spokesman said the Chinese firm was not currently using either FedEx or UPS services. On Sunday, Huawei tweeted it was not within FedEx\u2019s right to prevent the delivery and said the courier had a \u201cvendetta.\u201d  China\u2019s foreign ministry asked for a full explanation.  Neither China\u2019s commerce ministry nor FedEx responded to Reuters requests for comment on the likelihood of FedEx being added to the blacklist. State news agency Xinhua previously said the investigation into FedEx misrouting Huawei packages should not be regarded as retaliation.  Being in the \u201ccrosshairs\u201d of the Chinese government \u201cis a tremendous headwind and risk\u201d for FedEx, said Trip Miller, managing partner at Memphis-based Gullane Capital Partners, which holds a FedEx position valued at roughly $7 million.","173":"May 15 (Reuters) - FedEx Corp:  * FEDEX CORPORATION RECOMMENDS STOCKHOLDERS REJECT BELOW-MARKET MINI-TENDER OFFER BY TRC CAPITAL CORPORATION  * FEDEX CORP - FEDEX DOES NOT ENDORSE TRC CAPITAL\u2019S UNSOLICITED MINI-TENDER OFFER  * FEDEX CORP - CO IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH TRC CAPITAL, MINI-TENDER OFFER\/ MINI-TENDER OFFER DOCUMENTS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Reuters.Briefs@thomsonreuters.com)","174":"May 1 (Reuters) - FedEx Corp:  * PLUG POWER - CO, WORKHORSE GROUP DELIVERED TO FEDEX EXPRESS ITS FIRST NORTH AMERICAN FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE DELIVERY VAN FOR ON-ROAD USE Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","175":"June 23 (Reuters) - FedEx Corp said an \u201coperational error\u201d caused a Huawei Technologies Co Ltd phone to not be delivered to the United States and the package delivery company apologised for the error, the Global Times reported on Sunday.  \"FedEx can accept and transport all Huawei products except for any shipments addressed to listed Huawei entities on the U.S. Entity List,\" FedEx said in a statement cited by the newspaper bit.ly\/2ZKOrjF.

FILE PHOTO: A Federal Express truck on delivery is pictured in downtown Los Angeles, California October 29, 2014. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Shares of the company recouped from initial losses and were last up 1.4% at $157.76 in extended trading.  The United States and China have waged an 11-month trade war marked by tit-for-tat tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each others\u2019 goods, roiling financial markets, disrupting supply chains and crimping global economic growth prospects.  \u201cOur fiscal 2020 performance is being negatively affected by continued weakness in global trade and industrial production, especially at FedEx Express,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf said in a statement.  FedEx forecast a mid-single-digit percentage point decline in adjusted earnings for fiscal 2020.  \u201cIf we see these tariffs rise to say 25% as the Trump administration has talked about ... one of the biggest losers in the American economy would be FedEx,\u201d said Matthew White, a transportation and package delivery industry specialist.  \u201cTrade weakness is very hard to predict, as it can be caused by both policy and sentiment. Unfortunately, FedEx is seeing negative effects of both.\u201d  The shipping giant, which gets about a third of its revenue from outside the United States, has drawn Chinese ire over shipping mistakes involving several packages. Most recently, a package containing a Huawei phone sent to the United States was returned last week to its sender in Britain, in what FedEx said was an \u201coperational error.\u201d  Telecoms company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd in May was added to a blacklist of people and companies the U.S. government said posed a security risk, barring it from buying, without special approval, U.S. technology upon which it was heavily reliant.  FedEx on Monday sued the U.S. government, saying it should not be held liable if it inadvertently shipped products that violated the Trump administration ban.  E-COMMERCE  Earlier this month, FedEx decided not to renew its contract with Amazon, which represented less than 1.3% of its total revenue in the last calendar year, for U.S. cargo delivery through FedEx Express, the unit that delivers packages on planes.  FedEx described the decision as a strategic move that would allow it to focus on the broader e-commerce market, a group that would include rivals of Amazon scaling up one- and two-day delivery.  \u201cThe big emphasis going forward is going to be on e-commerce, which FedEx says will pressure yield,\u201d said Cathy Morrow Roberson, founder of consulting firm Logistics Trends & Insights. \u201cThey\u2019re right, especially for Express, and since they will be doing more residential deliveries, that will cost more as well.\u201d  FedEx also said the cost of integrating Dutch delivery company TNT Express into the company was now expected to be about $1.7 billion through fiscal 2021. Fedex had said in March the cost would be more than $1.5 billion. It bought TNT Express in 2016 for $4.8 billion and has struggled to integrate it into its own network.  Adjusted net income fell to $1.32 billion, or $5.01 per share, for the fourth-quarter ended May 31, from $1.60 billion, or $5.91 per share, a year earlier.  Revenue rose to $17.8 billion from $17.3 billion a year earlier, largely due to growth in U.S. volume and higher revenue per shipment at FedEx Freight and FedEx Ground.  Analysts on average had expected earnings of $4.85 per share and revenue of $17.79 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.","177":"(Updates with details)  BEIJING, June 14 (Reuters) - Chinese authorities have launched an investigation into FedEx Corp over parcels delivered to the wrong addresses, China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency reported on Friday.  The report did not give details about the deliveries in question.  FedEx did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Xinhua previously reported that China would investigate whether FedEx damaged the legal rights and interests of its clients after Huawei Technologies Co Ltd said this month the U.S. company diverted parcels destined for the Chinese firm\u2019s addresses in Asia to the United States.  FedEx said the packages were \u201cmisrouted in error\u201d.  The inquiry comes amid worsening trade relations between China and the United States, which saw the two governments slap new tit-for-tat tariffs on each other\u2019s goods last month.  Washington also last month put Huawei on a blacklist that effectively blocks U.S. firms from doing business with the Shenzhen-based telecoms equipment maker.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  FedEx stock has shed nearly half of its value since January 2018, when it hit an all-time high of $274.32. The U.S.-China trade war has hit the company, as has its costly and overdue integration of its European TNT Express acquisition and its breakup this summer with customer-turned-rival Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.  At least six analysts cut FedEx\u2019s price target, unswayed by executives\u2019 assertion that the business had bottomed and would improve substantially before the fiscal year ends in May 2020.  \u201cAfter a string of disappointments over the last 13 months, the burden of proof is on management,\u201d Susquehanna analyst Bascome Majors said in a note.  FedEx shares were the biggest drag on the Dow Jones Transportation index .DJT, which was down 0.9%, and rival United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N fell 1.8%.  FedEx lowered its fiscal 2020 forecast by roughly 9%, citing costs related to launching seven-day delivery, lost revenue from its split with the world\u2019s top online retailer and the ongoing U.S-China trade standoff that has roiled global trade.  Internal missteps and the worst air cargo slump since the financial crisis slammed second-quarter profits in the Memphis-based company\u2019s mainstay Express unit that caters largely to businesses seeking speedy deliveries.  Executives, who are parking planes and restricting hiring to compensate, said FedEx\u2019s troubled TNT Express integration was still two years from completion.  The company\u2019s bid to capture surging e-commerce shipments with the addition of year-round Sunday deliveries cost more than expected in the latest quarter. This resulted in a year-over-year drop in FedEx Ground\u2019s adjusted operating profit that unit chief Henry Maier dubbed \u201chorrific\u201d on a conference call with analysts.  FedEx Ground expects to wring out more residential profit by shifting the delivery of millions of SmartPost packages from U.S. Postal Service mail carriers to its own drivers. The goal is to reduce costs by increasing the number of parcels dropped at every stop, but analysts noted that profits on those packages are razor thin.  Bernstein analyst David Vernon did not rule out further forecast reductions.  \u201cThings are bad, but it\u2019s not clear that the floor is in yet,\u201d Vernon said.","179":"(Reuters) - FedEx Corp FDX.N Chief Executive Frederick Smith has challenged the publisher of the New York Times & Co NYT.N and the editor of the business section of the newspaper to a public debate in response to a story about the company's tax bill.  The package delivery firm\u2019s financial filings showed it owed no taxes in the 2018 fiscal year overall due to President Donald Trump\u2019s tax overhaul, according to the NYT story published on Sunday.  Smith late on Sunday called the story here \"distorted and factually incorrect\" and challenged NYT's publisher A.G. Sulzberger and the business section editor to a public debate in Washington.  \u201cFedEx\u2019s colorful response does not challenge a single fact in our story. We\u2019re confident in the accuracy of our reporting,\u201d Danielle Rhoades Ha, VP-communications at NYT, said in an email on Monday.  \u201cFedEx\u2019s invitation is clearly a stunt and an effort to distract from the findings of our story.\u201d  Smith, in his statement here, said the focus of the debate should be the federal tax policy and the relative societal benefits of business investments along with intended benefits to the economy."}}
