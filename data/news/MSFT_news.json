Microsoft Corp, America\u2019s most valuable company, gained 2.7% premarket, after strength in its cloud business helped it beat analysts\u2019 estimates at the end of a week of mixed corporate results.

So when Thyssenkrupp North America needed help predicting when to service its lifts, it turned to Microsoft Corp, a partnership that illustrates how Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Satya Nadella, has leveraged the cloud to grow its own business.  A 2014 meeting between the leadership of the North American operations of Germany\u2019s Thyssenkrupp AG and newly installed Microsoft CEO Nadella led to MAX, a predictive maintenance service built on Azure, Microsoft\u2019s cloud-computing platform, which has since been used to connect the elevators of 41,000 Thyssenkrupp customers to the cloud.  Before that meeting, the company\u2019s relationship with Microsoft consisted largely of renewing its license for Windows software. Since then, Thyssenkrupp North America\u2019s spending with Microsoft has more than doubled, CEO Patrick Bass told Reuters. \u201cOur IT spend as a whole total is going down, and yet our capabilities and our total spend with Microsoft have substantially increased.\u201d  Leveraging the cloud to enlarge its relationship with customers like Thyssenkrupp has been a key to Nadella\u2019s strategy, and it has paid off: Microsoft shares are up 180 percent since Nadella took over, and its market cap edged above $800 billion for the first time earlier this month.  When it reports earnings on Thursday, the tech giant is once again expected to post banner results, fueled by its fast-growing Office 365 productivity suite subscription service and the Azure cloud computing business.  Its work with Thyssenkrupp illustrates the success Microsoft has had in moving from its traditional licensing model to an emphasis on partnerships and subscription-based cloud-computing products and services.  Bass said Thyssenkrupp has flagged 26 digitization projects, and today every single one \u201chas some touch point into the tech platforms of Microsoft.\u201d  Thyssenkrupp has \u201cgone from being a producer of things and a servicer of things to selling things as a service,\u201d said Sam George, Microsoft director of Azure IoT engineering. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone through quite a transformation.\u201d  George said he has accompanied Nadella on several customer visits. Microsoft has entered similar partnerships with companies including Kroger Co, Starbucks Corp , Chevron Corp and Adobe Systems Inc. The company said 75 percent of Fortune 500 companies have at least three Microsoft cloud enterprise services, up from 70 percent having at least two in 2015.  Since changing the way it reports revenue in late 2015 to emphasize cloud services, Microsoft has seen its Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Office 365, go from declining 3 percent year-over-year in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 to 28 percent growth in the first quarter of 2018. Growth in the company\u2019s Intelligent Cloud, which includes Azure, has gone from 8 percent in the 2016 first quarter to 14 percent in the same period this year  Most recently, Thyssenkrupp North America has been rolling out the Office 365 productivity suite across all of its businesses while encouraging employees to use Microsoft\u2019s Teams collaboration software. It is also using Dynamics 365 as its customer relationship management software of choice.  Bass said his company no longer uses private data centers and is on a path to eliminate on-premise computer servers. Already, 50 percent of Thyssenkrupp North America\u2019s compute and storage is deployed on Azure, and that is expected to grow to more than two thirds within the next 12 months.  Among recent projects he\u2019s proud of, Bass highlighted the use of HoloLens, Microsoft\u2019s augmented reality glasses and associated Azure software, in Thyssenkrupp\u2019s stair lift business. HoloLens lets Thyssenkrupp show customers what a stair chair could look like when installed at home, reducing delivery waits from 12 weeks to less than three weeks, Bass said.  \u201cWe are going to leverage the services of the Azure cloud platform to its fullest,\u201d Bass said.

The \u201cRome Call for AI Ethics\u201d asserts that the technology should respect privacy, work reliably and without bias, consider \u201cthe needs of all human beings\u201d and operate transparently - an area of ongoing research because AI systems\u2019 decisions are often inscrutable.  The document reflects growing interest among companies and institutions to set guardrails for the fast-evolving technology. Police have used facial recognition systems to investigate crimes, and Fortune 500 companies have used AI to vet job applicants - both examples of high-stakes tasks where deploying inaccurate or biased software could lead to harm.  The Vatican\u2019s initiative grew out of concerns that Pope Francis raised about AI and its effect on society more than a year ago, according to John Kelly III, executive vice president of IBM and one of the signatories.  \u201cHis major concerns were, will it be available to everyone, or is it going to further bifurcate the haves and the have-not\u2019s?\u201d Kelly told Reuters in an interview. Vatican officials also had concerns about AI displacing jobs and met with IBM in the United States at a research center in September, he said.  Pope Francis was due to receive the document Friday to conclude a conference that the Vatican\u2019s Pontifical Academy for Life hosted this week on AI ethics. Others participating included the European Parliament\u2019s President David Sassoli and Microsoft\u2019s President Brad Smith.  It was not immediately clear which other technology companies might sign on to the document going forward, or how signatories would implement the principles.  IBM for instance wants a doctor to be in the loop when its AI makes healthcare recommendations - something that may increase over time following a deal it announced this week with the Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children\u2019s Hospital in Rome. That partnership will focus on developing technology to speed up diagnosis and treatment of brain tumor patients.  Both IBM and Microsoft have said they turned down business when they felt uncomfortable with how a customer wanted to use their technology. Still, according to Kelly, about a third of the ethics questions IBM typically faces have no obvious answer.  \u201cGoing forward we\u2019re going to see more falling in that category, only because the technology is advancing so fast,\u201d he said.

Pedestrians pass a video advertisement for IBM at their office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S., January 16, 2018. REUTERS\/Brian Snyder  Armonk, New York-based IBM on Monday sued its former chief diversity officer, Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, who left for a similar job at Microsoft Corp MSFT.O. The lawsuit alleges McIntyre violated a one-year non-competition agreement and could disclose IBM's diversity data and hiring plans.  IBM\u2019s stance puts it at odds with trends in the tech industry and broader corporate world towards sharing diversity success stories and best practices, instead seeming to view diversity as a zero-sum game.  The lawsuit is unusual because IBM is arguing its diversity data and strategy are economically valuable \u201ctrade secrets,\u201d a legal term typically associated with closely guarded formulas like that for Coca-Cola. It appears to be the first company to bring such a lawsuit against a rival over diversity efforts, legal experts said.  IBM cited in its complaint McIntyre\u2019s knowledge and oversight of its plans to hire 50 diverse candidates to executive positions and its development of artificial intelligence-based tools to track the career development of women and minorities at the company.  According to IBM, knowledge of this \u201chighly confidential, proprietary, and competitively sensitive information\u201d would allow Microsoft to compete for the same talent and business from customers that value diversity.  Once synonymous with white men in dark suits, IBM created task forces in 1995 to address the issue and soon greatly increased the diversity of its management.  Y-Vonne Hutchinson, an Oakland, California-based diversity consultant and lawyer who works with the tech industry, said IBM has had a legitimate edge over its industry rivals when it comes to diversity.  IBM\u2019s tools for reaching it diversity goals could qualify as trade secrets if it can show they are valuable to competitors, said Villanova University law professor Michael Risch.  IBM said in a statement that it \u201chas a long history of being recognized for leadership in a diverse and inclusive workplace.\u201d  Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, which is not named in IBM\u2019s lawsuit, said it had no interest in IBM\u2019s confidential information.  \u2018PUBLIC CONDEMNATION\u2019  Russell Beck, a lawyer specializing in trade secrets law, said he was surprised to see IBM make such nakedly economic arguments about diversity, noting that corporations more typically cast their efforts as benefiting society as a whole.  Most large tech firms have long faced criticism for the lack of diversity of their staffs. IBM took a shot at Microsoft in its lawsuit, noting that the latter company has faced \u201cpublic condemnation and class action litigation\u201d for its struggles to recruit and promote women.  Microsoft is seeking to dismiss as without merit a class action alleging pay and promotion discrimination.  Microsoft and IBM both derive much of their revenue from selling software and cloud computing services to big companies, a number of which have said they seek diversity in their vendors and suppliers.  Other tech companies have previously argued for the confidentiality of diversity information, though more out of fear of public criticism and litigation than competition, said John Cary Sims, a professor at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, California.  But more have recently embraced transparency. In 2014, Google released diversity data after previously trying to keep it private. Apple and Microsoft have also made their data public.  Joelle Emerson, a consultant who has advised Twitter Inc TWTR.N and Airbnb Inc on diversity efforts, criticized IBM's position.  \u201cIf you truly want to build a better industry, sharing learnings is actually a really helpful part of that,\u201d she said.  \u201cUltimately, a more diverse tech industry benefits every company within that industry.\u201d","16":"(Adds quote from director of Xbox platform marketing)  June 9 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp unveiled on Sunday its next-generation Xbox console, known as \u201cProject Scarlett,\u201d which is set to hit store shelves during the 2020 holiday season.  The device will be four times more powerful than the Xbox One X console and be powered by an Advanced Micro Devices chip, the company said during its Xbox E3 conference in Los Angeles.  The console will show up to 120 frames per second, or twice the average TV, and include a solid-state drive, Microsoft said, allowing games to load much faster than on its older mechanical hard drives.  The latest version of Microsoft\u2019s popular \u201cHalo\u201d videogame will be launched along with the new console.  Microsoft also announced 14 game titles from Xbox Game Studios, including shooter video game \u201cGears 5.\u201d  Rival Sony Corp has also disclosed plans of its next-generation PlayStation 5 console, with similar specifications including an AMD chip, but no official release date has been announced. Analysts expect a late 2020 release.  Microsoft said its game-streaming service \u201cProject xCloud\u201d would go into preview in October. Rival Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google on Thursday started taking pre-orders for its Stadia game-streaming service which will launch in November.  A new feature will allow users to stream games directly from their own Xbox consoles, instead of Microsoft\u2019s servers, the company said.  \u201cTwo months ago we connected all Xbox developers to Project xCloud,\u201d Phil Spencer, Microsoft\u2019s executive vice president for gaming, said. \u201cNow, the console streaming service will \u201cturn your Xbox One into your own personal and free xCloud server.\u201d  \u201cWhether you\u2019re using a console in our data center or your console at home, this October you\u2019ll be able to use our hybrid gaming cloud to play your games wherever you go. Where you play is now entirely your choice,\u201d Spencer said.  The company announced \u201cProject xCloud\u201d last October saying it was testing a new game streaming service designed to work across PCs, consoles and mobile devices.  Since then, Microsoft has revealed that the service uses hardware similar to that in its existing Xbox One gaming consoles.  \u201cThat means an existing library of more than 3,500 games will work on the service without any changes or modifications required by the developer,\u201d Microsoft said in a blog post in May.  Analysts have said Microsoft is better positioned than most to capitalize on cloud gaming, citing its strength in infrastructure, content it owns, and experience in gaming. But internet speed could affect game streaming.

Microsoft\u2019s press office in Brazil said in an emailed statement it was not officially notified about the prosecutors\u2019 lawsuit, so it could not comment on it. The company underscored that the protection of users\u2019 data was a top priority and said it was ready to clarify any questions prosecutors may have.  Federal prosecutors said in a statement that the default setting for Brazilian customers when they installed Windows 10 gave automatic approval for the company to collect user data, such as browsing and search histories, the content of emails and their location.  \u201cThe procedure violates innumerous constitutional principals, such as the privacy protection,\u201d the federal prosecutors office in Sao Paulo said.  It said it filed a civil lawsuit against Microsoft to block Windows 10 \u201cfrom continuing to collect personal data without users\u2019 express consent.\u201d  Prosecutors asked that the company stop within 15 days its \u201cautomatic collection of data\u201d by Windows 10. They are also demanding that Microsoft include alerts for consumers when they install the software, so that they better understand \u201cthe consequences of authorizing the transfer of data.\u201d  The Brazilian authorities added that their lawsuit was asking that Microsoft be fined 10 million reais ($2.87 million) and 100,000 reais for each day it does not comply with prosecutors\u2019 demands.  It was not clear when a judge may issue a ruling.  Prosecutors said users were able to opt out of allowing Microsoft 10 to sweep up much of their personal information - but that installing it in that manner was \u201clabor intensive and complex\u201d for consumers, and that the software still collected some information.  The statement said Microsoft was trying to increase profits on the back of the data collected by Windows 10, for instance by aiming advertising at specific groups of consumers.  Prosecutors added that several federal government entities, including the judicial system and electoral agencies, used the Microsoft software, creating a risk that legally private information could be made public.

With Microsoft and Apple rallying almost 3 percent, Apple\u2019s market capitalization for a few seconds was $806.6 billion, exceeding Microsoft\u2019s by $200 million and Amazon\u2019s by about $1.2 billion.  Microsoft quickly returned to its spot as the most valuable company, but Apple was on track to end the session above Amazon, up 0.4 percent, taking the No 2 spot.  Apple\u2019s stock has risen 11 percent since its quarterly report last Tuesday, with investors betting it was oversold following months of concern about a slowdown in iPhone demand, and the company\u2019s rare revenue warning on Jan. 2 related to soft demand in China.  After touching a record $1.1 trillion last October, Apple\u2019s market capitalization fell gradually, and it was overtaken in December by Amazon and Microsoft.  Apple\u2019s stock market value hit a low of $675 billion on Jan. 3 after its revenue warning, but then steadily recovered, helped in part by a quarterly report that was better than feared by investors.  While Apple has gained in recent sessions, Microsoft and Amazon\u2019s stocks have fallen after their quarterly reports. Amazon has declined about 4 percent since Thursday, when it forecast first-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates and warned over new regulations in India.  Since Wednesday, when Microsoft met targets for its quarterly results and forecast, its stock has slipped nearly 1 percent.  Google-parent Alphabet was up 2.6 percent, putting its stock market value at $788 billion.

Microsoft and Amazon alone had a combined worldwide market share of more than 50% in the third quarter of 2020, according to Synergy Research Group.  This dominance has raised concerns in Europe that sensitive corporate data could be insecure in the wake of the adoption of the U.S. CLOUD Act of 2018 and in the absence of any major competitors, except China\u2019s Alibaba.  The concerns led to creation of European association Gaia-X, set up to establish common standards for storing and processing data on servers that are sited locally and comply with the European Union\u2019s strict laws on data privacy.  Atos and OVHcloud say they together have a network of 130 data centres able to host data in virtual spaces whose resources are not shared with other users, or private environments.  French cybersecurity agency ANSSI recently granted its so-called SecNumCloud label to OVHcloud, a certification that requires the implementation of high security standards.  Atos, whose computer scientists also help companies install cloud computing services from Microsoft, Google and Amazon, will provide cybersecurity software hosted by OVHcloud.  Amazon, Microsoft and Google say they abide by EU rules and make sure they protect the data entrusted to them.  Many analysts are sceptical of the ability of newcomers to dent the dominance in Europe of U.S. companies, which have spent heavily in recent years to expand in the region.","21":"BERLIN (Reuters) - Business software group SAP said on Monday it had reached a three-year deal with Microsoft to help its large enterprise customers move their business processes into the cloud.  The partnership, called \u201cEmbrace\u201d, will help clients to run operations hosted at remote servers supported by SAP\u2019s flagship S\/4HANA database, new Co-Chief Executive Jennifer Morgan said as SAP released third-quarter results in line with preliminary figures released on Oct. 11.  \u201cWe bundled SAP\u2019s cloud platform services to support customers around the extension, integration and orchestration of SAP systems,\u201d Morgan told reporters, adding that Microsoft would act as a reseller for the product.  SAP said it expected annual revenues of around 75 million euros ($84 million) from the deal: \u201cThere\u2019s no downside to those numbers - only upside,\u201d she told analysts on a call.  In the third quarter, SAP reported a 10% increase in revenue and a 15% rise in operating profit, after adjusting one-off items and currencies, helping it to achieve an expansion of 1.7% in its operating margins. The company reiterated its forecast for the year and through to 2023.  Morgan also praised the performance of Qualtrics, the customer experience platform that SAP acquired a year ago in an $8 billion deal that some analysts and investors criticized as overpriced.  She said that Qualtrics had added more than 300 clients since May, with customers often buying it together with SAP\u2019s human resources product SuccessFactors. Qualtrics founder Ryan Smith - now an SAP management board member - said its deal size had grown by 30% since the takeover.  UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT  Disclosure of the Microsoft partnership comes after long-time CEO Bill McDermott stepped down to make way for Morgan - the first woman to become CEO of a company in Germany\u2019s blue-chip DAX index - and fellow Co-CEO Christian Klein.  Shares, which had rallied strongly on news of the leadership handover, added another 2.3% in trading in Frankfurt on Monday.  The deal - which helped SAP double new cloud bookings in the third quarter - addresses a complaint from many customers that it is too hard to shift from SAP\u2019s traditional on-premise model to remotely hosted services.  The partnership deepens an already close relationship with Microsoft and its Azure cloud division, although the Walldorf-based company said clients hosted by Google and Amazon Web Services could still buy direct from SAP.  De-emphasizing its own-brand cloud offering is turning out to be one factor supporting a pickup in SAP\u2019s cloud gross margins. These picked up by 5.4 percentage points to 69% in the third quarter - compared with a 2023 target of 75%.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Microsoft shares have tripled since Satya Nadella became chief executive in 2014 and refocused the company on building data center software and services. The stock, which has risen more than 21 percent over the past 12 months, gained 1.9 percent in after-hours trading following the earnings report.  Much of Microsoft\u2019s recent growth has been fueled by companies moving to the cloud from on-premise data centers, helping it to beat analysts\u2019 profit targets for more than two years.  Commercial cloud revenue, which includes Azure sales, hit $8.5 billion, up 47 percent from the year-ago quarter. The growth margin for that business rose to 62 percent from 58 percent in the year-ago quarter and 59 percent in the prior quarter.  Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O leads in cloud infrastructure services with a second-quarter market share of over 30 percent, according to market research firm Canalys, but Microsoft's share rose to 18 percent from 16 percent in the previous quarter.  Azure revenue rose 76 percent over the year, slower than the 89 percent rise in the previous quarter.  Blair Hanley Frank, principal analyst at technology research and advisory firm ISG, said investors have been alerted to Azure\u2019s slower growth.  \u201cSeeing that number decline to 76 percent where it was in the 80s and 90s is interesting.

Revenue from Microsoft\u2019s personal computing division, its largest by revenue, rose 14.6 percent to $10.75 billion. That figure beat the consensus analyst estimate of $10.13 billion. The unit includes Windows software, Xbox gaming consoles, online search advertising and Surface personal computers, but gaming is the growth driver with revenue up 44 percent from a year ago.  Microsoft forecast strong revenue for that division in the holiday quarter, of $12.8 billion to $13.2 billion.  \u201cXbox has the key gaming community and monetization capability,\u201d said Nadella.

Microsoft estimated revenue of $9.95 billion to $10.15 billion for that unit in the current quarter.  Overall, the Redmond, Washington-based software company\u2019s revenue rose to $29.08 billion from $24.54 billion, above analysts\u2019 average estimate of $27.90 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  Net income rose to $8.82 billion, or $1.14 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $6.58 billion, or 84 cents per share, a year earlier.

Earnings per share slightly exceeded expectations, but the software maker\u2019s stock fell 2 percent in extended trade after surging 3.3 percent earlier in a broader tech rally.  Azure, Microsoft\u2019s flagship cloud product, had revenue growth of 76 percent in the final quarter of 2018, down from a 98 percent surge a year earlier. Azure sales growth was 76 percent in the September quarter as well.  Long known for its Windows software, Microsoft has shifted focus to the cloud where it is dueling with larger rival Amazon.com Inc to control the still fledgling market.  The company is rapidly picking up business from the retail industry in particular, which is aiming to keep pace with the e-commerce business of Amazon. This month alone, Microsoft announced deals with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and Kroger Co, on top of a five-year agreement with Walmart Inc it unveiled this summer.  \u201cOur strong commercial cloud results reflect our deep and growing partnerships with leading companies in every industry including retail, financial services, and healthcare,\u201d Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said in a statement.

Wall Street analysts on average had expected revenue of $10.09 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Microsoft\u2019s personal computing division, home to Windows software and still its largest by revenue, showed revenue growth of 7 percent to $13 billion, while analysts had expected $13.07 billion. The unit also includes Xbox gaming consoles, the Bing online search service and Surface laptops.  Microsoft reported a profit of $8.42 billion or $1.08 per share in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $6.30 billion or 82 cents per share a year earlier.

The U.S. Army did not provide immediate comment.  Shares of Microsoft fell 7 cents to $110.90 after hours on Friday.  Though many governments want to draw upon the expertise of the biggest U.S. tech companies, employee resistance has added a new challenge to already complicated relationships.  Worker pushback led Alphabet Inc last year to announce it would not renew a Pentagon contract in which its artificial intelligence technology is used to analyze drone imagery.  In other cases, employee criticism has invited greater public scrutiny to deals, such as $10 billion cloud computing contract yet to be awarded and various contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  One Microsoft worker, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was unclear whether any of the lead petitioners\u2019 work was part of the Army contract.

The agency had been criticized after its cyberspies took advantage of vulnerabilities in Microsoft products to deploy hacking tools against adversaries and kept the Redmond, Washington-based company in the dark about it for years.  When one such tool was dramatically leaked to the internet in 2016, it was deployed against targets around the globe by hackers of all stripes.  In the most dramatic case, a group used the tool to unleash a massive malware outbreak dubbed WannaCry in 2017. The data-wiping worm wrought global havoc, affecting what Europol estimated was some 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries.  Neuberger did not directly address that controversy in her call but said that the NSA hoped to be \u201ca good cybersecurity partner.\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019re working to evolve our mission,\u201d she said.","36":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp agreed on Monday to pay about $25.3 million, including a criminal fine, to settle U.S. charges it made improper payments that were used to bribe government officials in Hungary and other countries.

Microsoft also agreed to pay nearly $16.6 million to settle related civil charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over its activities in Hungary, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Turkey, without admitting wrongdoing.  Both settlements resolved charges that Microsoft violated the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, after the Redmond, Washington-based company failed to properly account for the improper payments in its records.  In an email to employees, Microsoft President Brad Smith said the settlements \u201cinvolved employee misconduct that was completely unacceptable,\u201d and said the \u201csmall number\u201d of employees involved in Hungary were no longer with the company.  \u201cThere is no room for compromise when it comes to ethical business practices,\u201d Smith said in the email\u2019s subject line.

Executives and employees at Microsoft Hungary, which is based in Budapest, were accused of falsely telling Microsoft that steep discounts were needed to complete the transactions.  Prosecutors said the savings should have gone to customers, but were instead used by intermediary resellers in part to pay bribes to government officials, with Microsoft recording the discounts as legitimate business expenses.

REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri  COVID-19 has speeded up a move toward cloud-based computing, helping companies such as Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O cloud unit and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google Cloud. For Microsoft, it has also boosted demand for its Windows operating systems for laptops and its Xbox gaming services as families work, learn and play from home, leading to profit that was about 30% above expectations.  Daily users of its Teams messaging and collaboration software have risen to 115 million from 75 million in April, the company said.  \u201cIt was another healthy quarter, with continued demand for remote offerings continuing to power results,\u201d Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood told Reuters in an interview.  Revenue growth for Azure, the company\u2019s flagship cloud computing business, was 48%, up 1 percentage point from the previous quarter and ahead of Wall Street estimates of 43.45%, according to consensus data from Visible Alpha. Hood said the rise in the fiscal first quarter ending in September was driven by \u201can increase in larger, long-term Azure contracts.\u201d  On an investor call she forecast \u201ccontinued strong growth\u201d for Azure.  GRAPHIC: Microsoft Azure revenue growth -  Microsoft has shifted to selling many of its products via recurring subscriptions, which investors like because it generates stable revenue flows. The value of Microsoft\u2019s future recurring revenue contracts with big business customers was flat from the previous quarter and its proportion of one-time deals rose slightly after two quarters of growth.  Microsoft bundles several sets of software and services such as Office and Azure into a \u201ccommercial cloud\u201d metric that investors watch closely to gauge the company\u2019s progress in selling to large businesses. Microsoft\u2019s commercial cloud gross margins - a measure of the profitability of its sales to large businesses - was 71%, compared with 66% a year earlier.  Hood said some of the rise was explained by a change in accounting rules for Microsoft's servers, but the better margins were also driven by sales of lucrative software such as Dynamics 365, which competes with Salesforce.com CRM.N.  \u201cThat Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 38% was better than we thought and quite good,\u201d Hood told Reuters.  Microsoft said 93% of commercial cloud products were sold as subscriptions, compared with 94% the quarter before. The company\u2019s remaining performance obligations - a measure of how much revenue has been booked for the future in sales contracts but not yet formally recognized as revenue - stayed flat at $107 billion in the fiscal first quarter but was up from $86 billion a year prior.  Microsoft said revenue in its \u201cIntelligent Cloud\u201d segment rose 20% to $13 billion in the most recent quarter. Analysts had expected revenue of $12.7 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Revenue from its personal computing division, which includes Windows software and Xbox gaming consoles, rose 6% to $11.8 billion.

FILE PHOTO: The Microsoft logo is shown on the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 13, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The nine justices will hear arguments on Tuesday in a case that pits the interests of tech companies and privacy advocates in safeguarding customer data against the demands of law enforcement in obtaining information crucial to criminal and counterterrorism investigations.  The case began with a 2013 warrant obtained by prosecutors for emails of a suspect in a drug trafficking investigation that were stored in Microsoft computer servers in Dublin. The company challenged whether a domestic warrant covered data stored abroad. The Justice Department said because Microsoft is based in the United States, prosecutors were entitled to the data.  The case is being closely watched by other countries wrestling with similar concerns, including members of the European Union. A ruling is due by the end of June.  A 2016 decision by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals siding with Microsoft marked a victory for tech firms that increasingly offer cloud computing services in which data is stored remotely. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court.  Globally dominant American tech companies have expressed concern that customers will go elsewhere if they think the U.S. government\u2019s reach extends to data centers all around the world without changes being made to the law.  Microsoft, which has 100 data centers in 40 countries, was the first American company to challenge a domestic search warrant seeking data held outside the United States.  Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, told reporters last week the U.S. government should not be able to act unilaterally to access such data without taking into account the laws and interests of other countries.  \u201cIt\u2019s more likely to be a recipe for international tension and chaos,\u201d Smith said.  Solicitor General Noel Francisco, the administration\u2019s top lawyer in Supreme Court cases, said in court papers that a ruling for Microsoft \u201cwould hamper domestic law enforcement and counterterrorism efforts.\u201d  If the Supreme Court were to rule in favor of Microsoft, the government could still gain access data held overseas, but the process would be more cumbersome and potentially take longer.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Lawmakers are considering making changes to the 1986 law.  Bipartisan legislation has been introduced in Congress to update the statute, a move backed by both Microsoft and the administration. The measure would let U.S. judges issue warrants while giving companies an avenue to object if the request conflicts with foreign law. If Congress were to pass the bill before the Supreme Court rules, the case would likely become moot.  BEYOND REACH  Though Microsoft is based in the United States - Redmond, Washington, to be precise - the appeals court said the emails were beyond the reach of domestic search warrants obtained under a 1986 U.S. law called the Stored Communications Act.  The Microsoft customer whose emails were sought told the company he was based in Ireland when he signed up for his account.  Other companies including IBM Corp, Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google filed court papers backing Microsoft. Google has mounted challenges similar to Microsoft\u2019s.  The administration has the support of 35 states led by Vermont who say they routinely seek access to data stored overseas, especially in cases involving child pornography.  Several foreign governments, including Ireland and Britain, filed court papers raising concerns about the U.S. government\u2019s position.  Ireland\u2019s government said in its brief that the question of how law enforcement authorities can access such information is already covered by a 2001 treaty with the United States that allows for information sharing and enforcement of court orders.  The treaty\u2019s procedures \u201crepresent the most appropriate means to address requests such as those which are the object of the warrant in question,\u201d Ireland\u2019s brief said.  The European Commission, representing the 28-country European Union, filed a brief saying that when a country is seeking data from outside its jurisdiction \u201cthe interests and laws of that foreign jurisdiction must be taken into account.\u201d  The Supreme Court has ruled twice in recent years in major cases concerning how criminal law applies to new technology, both times ruling against law enforcement. In 2012, the court held that a warrant is required to place a GPS tracking device on a vehicle. In 2014, the court ruled that police need a warrant to search a cellphone seized during an arrest.  In the court\u2019s current term, which ends in June, the justices are due to rule on another privacy issue on whether police need search warrants to access cellphone location information held by wireless carriers. Based on the Nov. 29 oral argument, the justices appear likely to rule against law enforcement again.","50":"(Adds Amazon\u2019s contesting the award; Defense Secretary\u2019s response)  Nov. 15 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said on Thursday it is contesting the Pentagon\u2019s award of an up to $10 billion cloud computing deal to Microsoft Corp, expressing concern that politics got in the way of a fair contracting process.  Last month, Microsoft beat favorite Amazon for the contract, called the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, or JEDI, which is part of a broad modernization of the Pentagon\u2019s information technology systems.  Here is a timeline of important dates leading up to the award:  JULY 26, 2018: The Pentagon released the final request for proposals from competitors, seeking a single winner to allow for the most rapid adoption of the technology. It said the deal\u2019s initial two-year period would provide time to ensure JEDI was up to standards, noting that new contractors would be needed for other cloud computing demands in the future. The contract, valued at $10 billion over 10 years, was set to be awarded in September.  AUGUST 6, 2018: Oracle Corp filed a protest with the DOD over its plans to award the contract to a single company instead of allowing for multiple winners, arguing that the Pentagon would be locked into a legacy contract for a decade or more. DOD\u2019s Government Accountability Office had until November to respond.  OCTOBER 8, 2018: Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google said it was no longer vying for the $10 billion cloud computing contract with the DOD, in part because the company\u2019s new ethical guidelines did not align with the project, without elaborating.  OCTOBER 9, 2018: Microsoft said its expanded Azure cloud service to help government clients save data on their own servers would be available by the end of the first quarter of 2019, as it battled Amazon.com for the contract. NOVEMBER 14, 2018: The Government Accountability Office denied the protest filed by Oracle, finding that the agency \u201creasonably\u201d determined that the single-award approach was in the government\u2019s best interests for reasons including national security concerns and complied with applicable law.  APRIL 26, 2019: Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp were selected to continue competing for Pentagon cloud-computing services as part of a contract that could be worth some $10 billion.  The selection left Oracle and IBM Corp out of the competition for the contract, which is part of a broad modernization of Pentagon information technology systems.  JULY 18, 2019: U.S. President Donald Trump said his administration was looking closely at Amazon.com\u2019s bid on a $10 billion cloud contract with the DOD after getting complaints from other technology companies.  JULY 19, 2019: Four Republican members of U.S. Congress, including House Armed Services Committee ranking member Mac Thornberry, sent a letter to Trump urging him to move forward with a $10 billion cloud contract with the DOD.  AUGUST 1, 2019: The Pentagon decided to put on hold its decision to award the $10 billion cloud-computing contract after Trump said his administration was examining Amazon.com Inc\u2019s bid following complaints from other technology companies.  AUGUST 5, 2019: Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Jack Reed asked U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper if \u201coutside\u201d influence caused him to delay awarding a $10 billion cloud-computing contract, after Trump suggested Amazon.com Inc should not win it.  OCTOBER 22, 2019: U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper removed himself from reviewing a disputed $10 billion cloud-computing contract because of a possible conflict of interest.  OCTOBER 25, 2019: The Defense Department said that Microsoft Corp has won the U.S. Pentagon\u2019s $10 billion cloud-computing contract, beating out favorite Amazon.

Boeing Co tumbled 5.6% after a report the planemaker was planning to cut 787 Dreamliner output by about half.  All of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes moved up, with information technology jumping 1.3% and consumer discretionary rallying 1.2%.  Even with Friday\u2019s gains, the S&P 500 was on course to end the week lower, with investors fearful of a deep economic slump following a near-crash in April business activity and weekly jobless claims topping 26 million in five weeks.  The index has recovered more than 25% from its March low and expectations are growing that more businesses will be allowed to reopen as coronavirus infections showed signs of peaking.  Georgia became the first state to push ahead with its plan to allow an array of small businesses to reopen on Friday despite disapproval from President Donald Trump and health experts.  Investors may be overestimating how quickly U.S. businesses can go back to normal, and the S&P 500 could fall 5% or more as it becomes evident that resuming normal economic activity may not happen for months, warned Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in North Carolina.  \u201cWe think this is likely to be a little bit of a sideways market, and we won\u2019t be surprised to see a bit of downside before we see more upside,\u201d Freedman said.  Overall, analysts still expect a 15% decline in S&P 500 first-quarter earnings, with profits for the energy sector estimated to slump more than 60%, raising fears of debt defaults, layoffs and possible bankruptcies.  New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly rose in March, but the gains are not likely to be sustainable amid the pandemic, which has abruptly shut down the economy and contributed to a collapse in crude oil prices.  The CBOE volatility index, known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, was down for the third straight session.  At 2:28 pm ET (1828 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.55% at 23,643.48 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.84% to 2,821.41.  The Nasdaq Composite added 1.05% to 8,583.87.  Verizon Communications Inc declined 0.4% after it lost 68,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill in the first quarter.  American Express Co dipped 0.9% after posting a 76% drop in first-quarter profit as the credit card issuer braced for potential losses stemming from the coronavirus outbreak.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.28-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.44-to-1 ratio favored advancers.  The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 29 new highs and 11 new lows.

The drop in share price wiped off nearly $50 billion from the Microsoft\u2019s market value on a day when broader markets were down more than 2%.  The virus has so far infected about 80,000 people, killed nearly 2,800 and spread to 44 countries, after originating in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.  Apple was the first big technology firm to come out and say the virus was affecting its production and demand in China. PayPal Holdings Inc and Mastercard Inc have also warned about a possible hit.  Microsoft said on Wednesday its supply chain was returning to normal operations at a slower pace than anticipated and its Windows and Surface computers had been more negatively impacted than expected.  \u201cFinished good inventory levels matter. If Microsoft had not fully assembled and packaged Surface units in the channel, then the impact would be felt faster and more severely,\u201d Morningstar analyst Dan Romanoff said in a mail.  The global stock markets have also taken a hit as investors grew cautious of the impact of the virus on global supply chains. The Dow Jones Industrials index dropped more than 400 points at the open on Thursday.  Several Wall Street analysts expect other technology companies with heavy presence in China to soon come out with their own statements.  \u201cGiven there seems to be weakness in the PC supply chain, it would seem highly likely to me that we hear something from Intel,\u201d Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said in a mail.  Andrew MacMillen, an analyst with Nucleus Research, said that PC makers such as Dell Technologies Inc and Lenovo Group could be seeing some difficulties.  Dell, the world\u2019s third-biggest PC maker after Lenovo Group and HP, will report quarterly earnings after market close on Thursday. It has a sizeable exposure to China.  Microsoft said on Wednesday it would miss its own third-quarter revenue forecast for the PC unit, which houses Windows, of $10.75 billion and $11.15 billion.  J.P.Morgan analysts said that Microsoft\u2019s guidance is a supply chain issue, not a demand issue, but it was possible that broad supply chain issues plus investors becoming increasingly averse to risk could metastasize into demand issues over time.

Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith (R) makes a statement to the news media with his lawyer Josh Rosenkranz outside of the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, U.S., February 27, 2018. REUTERS\/Leah Millis  Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, both conservatives, indicated sympathy during an hour-long argument in the case toward the Justice Department\u2019s stance that because Microsoft is based in the United States it was obligated to turn over data held abroad sought by prosecutors in a U.S. warrant.  Liberal justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor questioned whether the court needed to act in the closely watched case in light of Congress now considering bipartisan legislation that would resolve the legal issue.  The case began when Microsoft balked at handing over a criminal suspect\u2019s emails stored in Microsoft computer servers in Dublin in a drug trafficking case. Microsoft challenged whether a domestic warrant covered data stored abroad.  A ruling is due by the end of June, giving Congress little time to act.  \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be wiser to say let\u2019s leave things as they are. If Congress wants to regulate in this \u2018Brave New World,\u2019 it should do it,\u201d Ginsburg said.  Alito agreed that Congress should act but added that \u201cin the interim, something has to be done.\u201d  If the court were to rule in favor of Microsoft and Congress does not amend the 1986 law at issue in the case, Alito wondered how the government could quickly obtain information in a major criminal investigation in which data is held overseas, potentially in several different countries.  \u201cWhat happens in that situation?\u201d Alito asked.  Roberts appeared concerned that companies like Microsoft could enable customers to evade the reach of U.S. prosecutors by deliberately storing data overseas.  Microsoft \u201cmight gain customers if you can assure them, no matter what happens, the government won\u2019t be able to get access to their e-mails,\u201d Roberts said.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The company\u2019s lawyer, Joshua Rosenkranz, responded that customers already know that other services existed that provided stronger privacy guarantees.  \u201cIf customers do not want their e-mails to be seized by the government, they don\u2019t use Microsoft\u2019s services,\u201d Rosenkranz said.  The case highlights the friction between tech companies and privacy advocates desiring to protect customer data and law enforcement wanting information vital to criminal and counterterrorism investigations.  LOWER COURT BACKED MICROSOFT  The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2016 sided with Microsoft, handing a victory to tech firms that increasingly offer cloud computing services in which data is stored remotely. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court.  The appeals court said the emails were beyond the reach of domestic search warrants obtained under a federal law called the 1986 Stored Communications Act.  Bipartisan legislation has been introduced in Congress to update the 1986 statute, a move backed by both Microsoft and the administration. The bill would let U.S. judges issue warrants while giving companies an avenue to object if the request conflicts with foreign law. Passage of the bill likely would render the case moot.  Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican who has led the efforts to rework the law, was in the courtroom to hear Tuesday\u2019s argument. He said in a statement afterward that his bill would resolve the legal question while balancing law enforcement and privacy interests.  \u201cThis commonsense legislation has the full-throated support of both law enforcement and the tech community and deserves swift enactment,\u201d Hatch added.  Globally dominant American tech companies have expressed concern that customers will go elsewhere if they think the U.S. government\u2019s reach extends to data centers all around the world without changes being made to the law.  Microsoft, which has 100 data centers in 40 countries, was the first American company to challenge a domestic search warrant seeking data held outside the United States. The Microsoft customer whose emails were sought told the company he was based in Ireland when he signed up for his account.  Other companies including IBM Corp, Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google filed court papers backing Microsoft. Several foreign governments, including Ireland and Britain, filed court papers raising concerns about the U.S. government\u2019s position.

In one of the fastest turns into a bear market, the S&P 500 and the Dow both ended the first quarter more than 20% below the end of 2019, as the health crisis worsened in the United States and brought business activity to a standstill.  It was also the S&P\u2019s biggest first-quarter decline on record as consumers were advised to stay at home, leading businesses to announce temporary closures and massive staff furloughs.  As a result, economists have slashed 2020 growth expectations and investors, eying dismal quarterly financial reports, fear corporate defaults and mass layoffs would lead to a deep recession.  An unprecedented round of fiscal and monetary stimulus had helped equity markets edge higher last week following wild swings that saw the benchmark S&P 500 rise 9% and slump 12% in two consecutive sessions.

Microsoft Corp, the most valuable U.S. company, rose 1.5% as strength in its cloud business helped it beat estimates at the end of a week of mixed earnings.  The gains also lifted the technology sector 0.53%, making it one of the six major S&P indexes trading higher.  \u201cMicrosoft is a sign that not all companies are suffering from the downturn we\u2019re seeing in manufacturing or the pressure from interest rates that\u2019s affecting financials,\u201d said Jeff Kleintop, chief global investment strategist, at Charles Schwab in Boston.  Second-quarter profits at S&P 500 companies are now estimated to rise 1%, according to Refinitiv IBES data, in a reversal from earlier expectations of a small drop.  Remarks from the New York Fed President John Williams, a permanent voting member of the Fed\u2019s policy setting committee, that the U.S. central bank cannot wait for economic disaster to unfold and must add stimulus early were behind Thursday\u2019s positive close.

The planemaker disclosed it would take a $4.9 billion after-tax hit due to estimated disruptions from the grounding of its 737 MAX, but shares gained 4.2% indicating that investors had expected worse.

The Nasdaq Composite was up 14.53 points, or 0.18%, at 8,221.77.  The main indexes have eased off all-time highs hit at the start of this week as some of the first batches of second-quarter earnings releases pointed to a slowdown in growth under the shadow of U.S.-China trade tensions.  The defensive real estate and utilities sectors posted the biggest losses.  Kansas City Southern shares rose 3.8% after the railroad operator posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Its shares helped the Dow Jones Transport index gain about 0.94%.  Credit card issuer American Express Co slipped 2.3% after warning of higher operating costs this year as it spends heavily on rewards programs to attract customers.

The Global Times is published by the People\u2019s Daily, the official newspaper of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party.","83":"(Reuters) - Microsoft has emerged as a savior to young users of TikTok, who praised the tech industry giant for trying to buy parts of the social media company\u2019s operations, in hopes of avoiding a U.S. shutdown.  Bearing hashtags like #SaveTikTok and #Microsoft, which have attracted nearly 1 billion views combined, TikTok\u2019ers - an overwhelmingly young group that uses the app to create short dance, lip-sync, comedy and talent videos - embraced a company founded by people their grandparent\u2019s age and whose former chief executive\u2019s pre-internet-era onstage outbursts and profuse sweating are now a YouTube meme.  A look at Microsoft\u2019s track record on recent acquisitions, including building game Minecraft in 2014 and business networking site LinkedIn in 2016, could validate TikTok users\u2019 optimism, analysts said.  In recent years, Microsoft has taken a hands-off approach to integrating new acquisitions, said Mike Vorhaus, chief executive of Vorhaus Advisors, a digital media consulting firm. For example, Microsoft left Minecraft\u2019s team operating in Europe, he said.  \u201cYou don\u2019t want to lose (TikTok\u2019s) secret sauce, but you want them to gain from Microsoft,\u201d he said.  Microsoft has largely abandoned its historic practice of tying all of its products back to its Windows operating system or other properties. Minecraft apps have no obvious connection to Microsoft. Its sales have quadrupled over the six years since it was acquired and it now reaches 126 million monthly users.  Under Satya Nadella, who took over as Microsoft CEO in 2014, the company purchased two large online communities that it has allowed to operate essentially autonomously. After acquiring business-oriented network LinkedIn for $26.2 billion, LinkedIn kept its brand identity, CEO and its own offices, while GitHub, the code-repository service acquired in 2018, has continued to build tools that help developers use Microsoft\u2019s rivals.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  JT Casey, a TikTok user with 2.8 million followers, said he was initially worried about the idea of Microsoft\u2019s ownership, but concluded there is a potential change that could benefit video creators.  \u201cI realized Microsoft will figure out a way to monetize better, which will lead to creators making more money, as well as Microsoft,\u201d he said.  TIME RUNNING OUT  While TikTok\u2019s fans are lauding Microsoft for coming to the rescue after President Donald Trump threatened a ban over concerns with how the Chinese-owned company handled user data, they are considering other options.  Dmitri Robinson, a 20-year-old TikTok user with more than 270,000 followers, said short-form video apps Triller and Byte are seen as the top two contenders for the next hottest app among conversations with friends and videos he has seen on TikTok.  On Friday, when Trump told reporters he planned to ban TikTok as soon as that weekend, downloads for four TikTok rivals - Triller, Byte, Dubsmash and Likee - all spiked on Sunday, according to data from Apptopia. Daily downloads in the United States for Triller on Sunday almost doubled to nearly 62,000.  Facebook Inc\u2019s Instagram is also readying the global launch of its TikTok rival, called Reels, which first debuted in Brazil in November.","84":"FILE PHOTO: A Microsoft logo is seen in Los Angeles, California U.S. November 7, 2017.

Its Windows and Surface computers had been more negatively impacted than expected, Microsoft said in a statement.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters Breakingviews) - Microsoft still has a shot at going viral without TikTok. The software giant lost out on the chance to buy the video app after its Chinese owner was forced to sell on national security grounds. But a better fit may be gaming chat service Discord, recently valued at about $7 billion according to TechCrunch. It\u2019s a cheaper, and less politically fraught, way for Microsoft to chase new users.  By trying to acquire the U.S. assets of TikTok, Chief Executive Satya Nadella showed where his firm\u2019s ambitions lie. TikTok would have given the $1.6 trillion Microsoft a social network of younger-skewing adherents. Owner ByteDance decided to instead sell a 20% stake to Oracle and Walmart in a deal that values TikTok at around $60 billion. In September, Microsoft bought ZeniMax Media, owner of popular game \u201cDoom,\u201d for $7.5 billion.  Discord offers some of what Microsoft missed out on. Its users chat in topic-based channels \u2013 called servers \u2013 by text, voice, video and pictures, all of which can be public or private. In June, the network co-founded by former game developer Jason Citron had over 100 million monthly aficionados, twice the number it had a year earlier. That\u2019s around one-seventh of TikTok\u2019s global users, but roughly the same as Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Live gaming service.  There\u2019s more overlap than with TikTok too. As well as gaming, Discord is gaining ground in education, where teachers and students use it for remote learning and study groups. Discord arguably looks like a consumer-facing version of Microsoft\u2019s Teams messaging service. It also makes money through subscriptions rather than advertisements, which puts it closer to Microsoft\u2019s own model. With $138 billion in cash, Microsoft can easily afford Discord.  Not that it needs a deal. Analysts already expect the software giant to grow revenue more than 10% for the next three years according to Refinitiv. And chasing consumers brings its own perils. Discord had to do damage control after white supremacists used its platform to plan a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. Social networking isn\u2019t for the faint hearted. If that\u2019s where Nadella\u2019s desires lie, though, Discord may not be a bad way to gratify them.","86":"TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T has secured pledges from Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and other investors of around $108 billion for a second Vision Fund aimed at investing in technology firms.  The Japanese conglomerate itself plans to invest $38 billion in the fund, it said in a statement. Others set to join include Apple Inc AAPL.O and Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn) 2317.TW - both investors in the first fund.  Notable by their absence on the list of state and corporate backers were the sovereign wealth funds of the two countries which formed the cornerstone of its first fund: Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, as well as investment bank Goldman Sachs GS.N.  SoftBank said it was still talking to potential investors and that it expected the fund\u2019s anticipated capital to grow.  Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Bloomberg in October his country was ready to commit a further $45 billion through its Public Investment Fund (PIF), adding: \u201cWithout the PIF, there will be no SoftBank Vision Fund\u201d.  Those close links later compelled Softbank founder and Chief Executive Masayoshi Son to defend the relationship after Saudi security personnel were accused of murdering Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist critical of the Saudi state.  Discussions between Softbank and PIF were ongoing, but the Saudis would wait for a formal proposal before deciding whether to invest in the new fund, a source familiar with the matter said.  A spokeswoman for Abu Dhabi\u2019s Mubadala told Reuters it was still in the process of assessing a potential investment. The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday reported Goldman Sachs would invest in the fund.

Bernstein analyst Chris Lane.  \u201cGiven the track record achieved over the last two years Vision Fund 2 has been substantially de-risked,\u201d Lane said.  SoftBank in May said the first fund had generated a 45% internal rate of return for investors in its common shares, or 29% when debt-like preferred shares are included - though the gains still exist mostly on paper.  On Friday, it said other participants in the second fund will include the National Investment Corporation of National Bank of Kazakhstan, Standard Chartered Bank PLC STAN.L, undisclosed parties from Taiwan and the fund's own managers.  The new fund has broad backing from Japan's financial industry including units of the three mega banks, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc 8306.T, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc 8316.T and Mizuho Financial Group Inc 8411.T, SoftBank's statement showed.  It said Daiwa Securities Group Inc 8601.T, Dai-ichi Life Holdings Inc 8750.T and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc 8309.T have also signed memoranda of understanding (MOU).  The financial structure of the fund, how much each investor would contribute and whether they would provide debt or equity backing was not disclosed by Softbank.  A spokeswoman for Standard Chartered, however, told Reuters the bank would take part in the fund as a debt investor.  \u201cThe objective of the fund is to facilitate the continued acceleration of the AI revolution through investment in market-leading, tech-enabled growth companies,\u201d SoftBank said in its statement.  Masayoshi Son uses artificial intelligence (AI) as a catch-all term to characterise SoftBank\u2019s investment portfolio, which features businesses as varied as ride-hailing and autonomous driving, insurance and healthcare.  SoftBank has not provided concrete details on the kind of investments it is targeting, said a senior executive at one Japanese bank listed as a participant in the new fund.  \u201cThe fund itself is of course attractive, but what matters is the overall balance of the portfolio,\u201d the banker said, declining to be identified further.  LATE-STAGE STARTUPS  Friday's announcement was driven largely by Softbank's need to alert shareholders to its planned investment in the fund. SoftBank Group's shares ended the day up 1.1% in a 0.5% weaker Nikkei 225 .N225.  The first Vision Fund launched two years ago with $60 billion in backing from the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi. It has already burned through much of its capital with investments in over 80 late-stage tech startups.  Bets included Uber Technologies Inc UBER.N and WeWork parent The We Company in a spending spree that has reshaped the venture capital industry as SoftBank outguns less-capitalised rivals.  \u201cWe\u2019ve seen several startups start to beat their rivals and push them out of the market, mainly because - and only after - they receive investment and backing from SoftBank,\u201d said one Hong Kong-based senior investor at a large venture capital firm.  SoftBank did not provide details on how it would fund its $38 billion contribution to the new fund. With the conglomerate not needing to put up all the money at once, proceeds from the first Vision Fund can potentially be recycled, said analyst Dan Baker at Morningstar.  Such a strategy would rely on the first fund continuing to provide blistering returns, as it transitions beyond identifying and investing in promising startups to managing a portfolio of companies that are listed or heading toward public markets.  \u201cWe believe this move should create a positive impression in as much as it confirms the substantial interest in the Vision Fund business and fund procurement capabilities,\u201d UBS analyst Kei Takahashi said in a note to clients.","87":"Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick partners Mark Hansen and Aaron Panner are defending Facebook Inc in antitrust lawsuits filed this week by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and nearly every U.S. state, a representative for the social media company confirmed.

We appreciate the Department\u2019s action in response to our request,\u201d a Microsoft spokesman told Reuters via email.  The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump said this week it would allow some suppliers to restart sales to the Chinese telecoms giant, which was placed on a trade blacklist over national security concerns six months ago.  The Commerce Department confirmed it had begun issuing licenses for some companies to sell goods to Huawei, expanding the company\u2019s supplier base and providing long-awaited clarity to the industry that once sold it billions of dollars worth of goods.  On Wednesday, a U.S. official said it had received roughly 300 license requests, about half of which had been processed. Roughly half of those \u2013 or one quarter of the total \u2013 had been approved and the rest denied.  It was not immediately clear which products had been approved for sale to Huawei, which is the world\u2019s top telecommunications equipment maker and second-largest smartphone maker. A person familiar with the process said Wednesday that some licenses for sales of cellphone components and non-electronic components were approved.  Microsoft declined to comment beyond its statement on which products had been approved, and the Commerce Department declined to comment.  Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said the license was most likely for the company\u2019s Windows operating system.  \u201cThis will be a major relief for Huawei after an arduous period with large technology players like Microsoft, Google and others restricted on the platform,\u201d Ives said.  Huawei has been anxiously awaiting a license for Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google to supply its mobile services to new models. Without access to Google services such as its Play Store for apps, Huawei phones will become harder to sell to consumers outside of China. Google declined to comment on Thursday.  The granting of licenses comes as the Trump administration is working to sign a phase one trade deal with China to end a tit-for-tat trade war that has roiled markets and hit global growth.  But the move immediately met with opposition. A bipartisan group of 15 senators urged the Commerce Department to suspend the issuing of licenses, saying it could threaten U.S. security.  In a letter on Thursday to Trump, the senators said the administration should halt issuing licenses until it provides Congress \u201ca report outlining specific criteria for determining whether or not the approval of any license poses a national security threat.\u201d","89":"FILE PHOTO: The Microsoft logo is shown on the Microsoft Theatre at the E3 2017 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 13, 2017.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/Files  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Microsoft needs to become its own activist. The software giant now has more than $50 billion in net cash on its balance sheet. Tax changes will boost its hoard even faster. With debt easily manageable, the company ought to boost dividends and buybacks, before pushy investors force it to.  The growth of cloud services is a strong wind at the $800 billion company\u2019s back. Businesses are rapidly switching to online versions of Microsoft\u2019s Office, customer-relationship and other enterprise software. As they do that, they also tend to buy more online computing, storage and other services from the company run by Satya Nadella.  Last quarter\u2019s results unveiled on Thursday, for example, show enterprise sales of Office 365 up more than 38 percent from 12 months ago, while revenue from Microsoft\u2019s cloud-computing platform almost doubled. This helped deliver total revenue just above $30 billion, 17 percent higher than the same period last year.  There seems little chance of that fading any time soon. That leaves the company\u2019s balance sheet looking oddly out of date. The majority of Microsoft\u2019s earnings come from overseas. It was too punitive to repatriate these until last year\u2019s changes to the U.S. tax code. Now the company has far more ready access to the greenbacks.  Microsoft\u2019s operations threw off over $31 billion of cash over the past 12 months after subtracting capital expenditure. It paid out $12.7 billion in dividends and $10.7 billion in buybacks over that period. That gave it enough to buy programming repository GitHub for $7.5 billion and still not tap its cash pile.  There\u2019s little reason for the company to be adding to its cash hoard. The company\u2019s size and its triple-A rating from S&P mean it can borrow for long periods of time incredibly cheaply. At present, though, it\u2019s paying down debt, which now stands at just 1.5 times expected EBITDA for the next fiscal year.  Microsoft typically ups its dividend and buyback plans each October. Analysts estimate the company should generate around $38 billion in free cash flow next year alone. Doubling how much it returns to shareholders, to about $47 billion, would still leave the company\u2019s balance sheet with net cash. Microsoft is incredibly conservative, but it\u2019s time for Mr. Softee to loosen the collar.","93":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Cyber security researchers have found a new security flaw that affects a broad swath of modern computing chips and is related to the Spectre and Meltdown chip flaws that emerged in January.  The newest chip problem, known as Speculative Store Bypass or \"Variant 4\" because it's in the same family as the original group of flaws, was disclosed by security researchers at Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google on Monday. Though the flaw affects many chips from Intel CorpINTC.O, Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O and Softbank Group's 9984.T ARM Holdings, researchers described the risks as low, partly because of web browser patches already issued earlier this year to address Spectre.  The Meltdown and Spectre flaws, which emerged in January, can allow passwords and other sensitive data on chips to be read. The flaws result from the way computers try to guess what users are likely to do next, a process called speculative execution.  When the flaws emerged in January, researchers warned that they were likely to find new variants of Spectre in the future. Earlier this month, German computer science magazine c\u2019t reported that a \u201cnext generation\u201d of flaws had been found in Intel\u2019s chips and was likely to be disclosed this month. Intel declined to comment on whether Monday\u2019s announcement was related to the German magazine\u2019s story.  In its research findings, Microsoft said that patches issued for common web browsers earlier this year greatly increased the difficulty of carrying out an attack with the newly discovered flaw.  Chips from Intel, AMD and ARM all have patches available, either directly from the makers or through software suppliers such as Microsoft. Intel said it expects a performance slowdown of between 2 percent and 8 percent from the patches, and ARM said it expects a slowdown of between 1 percent and 2 percent.  However, Intel said that because of the low risk of a real-world attack, it would ship its patches turned off by default, giving users the choice whether to turn them on. AMD also advised leaving the patches turned off due to the difficulty of carrying out an attack.  The security problems do not appear to have impacted chipmakers\u2019 stock prices. Intel shares are up nearly 16 percent to since the start of the year to $54.32, and AMD shares are up 18.3 percent to $12.99 since the start of the year.","94":"FILE PHOTO: The Microsoft logo is pictured ahead of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 24, 2019.

One feature can automatically replace the background during a video chat, for example cropping out a messy home bedroom and replacing it with a picture of a tidy commercial office. Another feature can filter out background sounds during a conference call, such as the crinkling of a plastic potato chip bag.

The company has a huge following among schools and students and it has relaxed here norms for schools by lifting its 40-minute meeting limit on free accounts to facilitate online classes. \"First, Zoom's big advantage, as far as software goes, is it's scalable, easy to use, and deployable across multiple devices,\" said DA Davidson analyst Rishi Jaluria. \"Second, Zoom has a freemium model, which allows companies to dip their toes in the water before committing to a large roll-out, and expansions come easy.\" Video conferencing platforms offer video and audio calls, one-to-one meetings, group conferencing, collaboration and productivity apps, and a secure interface.

FILE PHOTO: The Microsoft logo is pictured at a service centre in New Delhi, India, April 5, 2018. Picture taken April 5, 2018. REUTERS\/Saumya Khandelwal\/File Photo  The denial comes after a prior claim made by an executive of the U.S. technology giant following a client complaint in March.  Microsoft runs a global \u201csoftware asset management\u201d (SAM) program under which it partners with global consultants such as KPMG in India. Under that program, KPMG seeks permission from business owners to check for the use of unlicensed software.  Reuters reported earlier this month that Microsoft had begun probing KPMG\u2019s work in India after a member of India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, Vinit Goenka, complained to both companies that a KPMG employee had \u201cbarged in\u201d to his Mumbai recruitment firm without an appointment to check its software last month.  Following the incident, a senior Microsoft India executive, Rajiv Sodhi, wrote to Goenka and apologized, saying Microsoft was \u201cgetting an assessment agency to carry out an audit of the process delivery at KPMG to identify and correct gaps, if any,\u201d according to an e-mail reviewed by Reuters.  Microsoft and KPMG, who had earlier declined to comment on the probe, on Tuesday denied there was such an audit, and said allegations made against the program\u2019s implementation were \u201cincorrect\u201d.  \u201cMicrosoft and KPMG strongly refute any suggestion that Microsoft is auditing KPMG, or either company has engaged in any wrong doing,\u201d the companies said in the statement sent to Reuters.  A spokeswoman for Microsoft in India clarified on Tuesday that the company was only examining conduct around the recent incident and was not carrying out a broad probe into KPMG\u2019s other anti-piracy work for Microsoft.  POLICE COMPLAINT  Microsoft declined to comment on why Sodhi previously told Goenka there was an audit being carried out. It also declined to comment on whether it hired an assessment agency to do such an audit, citing employee and customer confidentiality concerns.  \u201cWhen a customer complains to us about a process issue they may have experienced, Microsoft and KPMG take the concern seriously and address appropriately through process review and gap assessment, if any,\u201d the companies said in the joint statement.  Sodhi did not respond to a request for comment.  Told about the statement from Microsoft and KPMG, Goenka said the companies should be addressing the issues he raised.  \u201cWhy would he (Sodhi) apologize if they had not done any mistake?\u201d said Goenka, who advises government committees on IT initiatives and filed a police complaint after the incident.  India is one of Microsoft\u2019s biggest markets in Asia, but over half of all software installed on computers in the country is unlicensed, advocacy group Business Software Alliance said in 2016.  Goenka said his firm, Ratein Infotech, used genuine software. Last month, he received a letter from Microsoft saying his company needed help in \u201cinterpreting licensing policies of Microsoft\u201d, according to emails seen by Reuters.  The issue escalated when a KPMG employee, identified only as Srijesh, entered Ratein\u2019s office on March 15.

The move represents an about-face for Trump and prompted the U.S. tech giant to declare its interest in the blockbuster social media deal that could further inflame U.S.-China relations. Trump said on Friday he was planning to ban TikTok amid concerns that its Chinese ownership represents a national security risk because of the personal data it handles.  The proposed acquisition of TikTok, which boasts 100 millions U.S. users, would offer Microsoft a rare opportunity to become a major competitor to social media giants such as Facebook Inc FB.O and Snap Inc SNAP.N. Microsoft also owns professional social media network LinkedIn.  Trump had dismissed the idea of a sale to Microsoft on Friday. But following a discussion between Trump and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, the Redmond, Washington-based company said in a statement on Sunday that it would continue negotiations to acquire TikTok from ByteDance, and that it aimed to reach a deal by Sept. 15.  This is a deadline that was put to ByteDance and Microsoft by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which scrutinizes deals for potential national security risks, according to the sources.  Trump changed his mind following pressure from some of his advisers and many in his Republican party, one of the sources said. Banning TikTok would alienate many of its young users ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November, and would likely trigger a wave of legal challenges. Several prominent Republican lawmakers put out statements in the last two days urging Trump to back a sale of TikTok to Microsoft.  \u201cA win-win in the making,\u201d Republican Senator Lindsey Graham tweeted in response to Trump\u2019s new stance on Sunday.  The negotiations between ByteDance and Microsoft will be overseen by CFIUS, a U.S. government panel that has the right to block any agreement, according to the sources, who requested anonymity ahead of a White House announcement. Microsoft cautioned in its statement that there is no certainty a deal will be reached.  \u201cMicrosoft fully appreciates the importance of addressing the President\u2019s concerns. It is committed to acquiring TikTok subject to a complete security review and providing proper economic benefits to the United States, including the United States Treasury,\u201d Microsoft said in a statement.  FILE PHOTO: People walk past a logo of Bytedance, the China-based company which owns the short video app TikTok, or Douyin, at its office in Beijing, China July 7, 2020. REUTERS\/Thomas Suen\/File Photo  ByteDance and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Microsoft talks. In a statement issued late on Sunday that did not mention TikTok, ByteDance said it faced \u201ccomplex and unimaginable difficulties\u201d in going global.  As relations between the United States and China deteriorate over trade, Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, cyber security and the spread of the novel coronavirus, TikTok has emerged as a flashpoint in the dispute between the world\u2019s two largest economies.  State-backed newspaper China Daily on Monday called ByteDance the victim of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d from the United States, and said Washington had not provided evidence to support its allegation that TikTok posed a threat to U.S. national security.  Under the proposed deal, Microsoft said it would take over TikTok\u2019s operations in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It said it would ensure that all private data of TikTok\u2019s American users is transferred to and remains in the United States.  Microsoft may invite other American investors to acquire minority stakes in TikTok, the company added. About 70% of the outside capital ByteDance has raised has come from the United States.  It is not clear how much Microsoft could pay for TikTok. Reuters reported last week that ByteDance\u2019s valuation expectations for the app exceeded $50 billion, although U.S. pressure to divest it could lower that price tag.  A key issue in the negotiations will be separating TikTok\u2019s technology from ByteDance\u2019s infrastructure and access, to alleviate U.S. concerns about the integrity of personal data. ByteDance owns a Chinese short video app called Douyin that was based on the same code used for TikTok.  One idea under consideration is to give Microsoft and ByteDance a transition period to develop technology for TikTok that will be completely separate from ByteDance, one of the sources said.  Microsoft said it did not intend to provide further updates until there was a definitive outcome in the negotiations.  APP SCRUTINY  The United States has been increasingly scrutinizing app developers over the personal data they handle, especially if some of it involves U.S. military or intelligence personnel. Ordering the divestment of TikTok would not be the first time the White House has taken action over such concerns.  Earlier this year, Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd 300418.SZ sold Grindr LLC, a popular gay dating app it bought in 2016, for $620 million after being ordered by CFIUS to divest.  In 2018, CFIUS forced China's Ant Financial to scrap plans to buy MoneyGram International Inc MGI.O over concerns about the safety of data that could identify U.S. citizens.  ByteDance was valued at as much as $140 billion earlier this year when one of its shareholders, Cheetah Mobile CMCM.N, sold a small stake in a private deal, Reuters has reported. The start-up's investors include Japan's SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T.

OCTOBER 8, 2018: Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google said it was no longer vying for the $10 billion cloud computing contract with the DOD, in part because the company\u2019s new ethical guidelines did not align with the project, without elaborating.  OCTOBER 9, 2018: Microsoft said its expanded Azure cloud service to help government clients save data on their own servers would be available by the end of the first quarter of 2019, as it battled Amazon.com for the contract. NOVEMBER 14, 2018: The Government Accountability Office denied the protest filed by Oracle, finding that the agency \u201creasonably\u201d determined that the single-award approach was in the government\u2019s best interests for reasons including national security concerns and complied with applicable law.  APRIL 26, 2019: Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp were selected to continue competing for Pentagon cloud-computing services as part of a contract that could be worth some $10 billion.  The selection left Oracle and IBM Corp out of the competition for the contract, which is part of a broad modernization of Pentagon information technology systems.  JULY 18, 2019: U.S. President Donald Trump said his administration was looking closely at Amazon.com\u2019s bid on a $10 billion cloud contract with the DOD after getting complaints from other technology companies.  JULY 19, 2019: Four Republican members of U.S. Congress, including House Armed Services Committee ranking member Mac Thornberry, sent a letter to Trump urging him to move forward with a $10 billion cloud contract with the DOD.  AUGUST 1, 2019: The Pentagon decided to put on hold its decision to award the $10 billion cloud-computing contract after Trump said his administration was examining Amazon.com Inc\u2019s bid following complaints from other technology companies.  AUGUST 5, 2019: Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Jack Reed asked U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper if \u201coutside\u201d influence caused him to delay awarding a $10 billion cloud-computing contract, after Trump suggested Amazon.com Inc should not win it.  OCTOBER 22, 2019: U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper removed himself from reviewing a disputed $10 billion cloud-computing contract because of a possible conflict of interest.","103":"FILE PHOTO: Screens display the company logo for Pinterest Inc. during the company's IPO on the front of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 18, 2019.

Amazon appears to have taken an early lead making in-roads with the Biden camp, according to data gathered by Reuters from OpenSecrets and campaign finance records, along with interviews with over a dozen stakeholders including anti-monopoly groups, lobbyists, congressional aides, competitors and lawmakers.  Joining Amazon, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft are among the top five contributors to Joe Biden's candidate campaign committee in the 2020 cycle, according to data from OpenSecrets, a website which tracks money in politics and campaign finance records. Click here tmsnrt.rs\/2GsjNa4 and here here for graphic on top contributors.  The firms are prohibited by law from donating themselves. The contributions were either made by the company\u2019s political action committees (PACs) themselves, members of the PAC or their employees.  Tech is strengthening relationships in case of a Biden victory to ensure they have a voice in an onslaught of federal and state investigations into their business practices, according to campaign finance records and interviews.  The industry\u2019s coziness with the Democratic Party, which dates back through several elections, has critics of their market dominance worried.  Sally Hubbard, who has worked with Democratic lawmakers in the past and currently focuses on monopoly power of tech companies at Washington-based Open Markets Institute, does not want a Biden victory to translate into a repeat of what was widely viewed as President Barack Obama\u2019s hands off approach to tech.  \u201cAre we going to see the same thing with a Biden administration?\u201d she asked, adding there will be a significant amount of pressure from anti-monopoly groups and the progressive wing of the Democratic party to hold the companies accountable.  Depending on the stance of a potential Biden administration, existing antitrust probes under President Trump and state attorneys general could intensify or be weakened.  Biden, for his part, has criticized large internet companies during interviews and campaign events. He has urged the revocation of a key legal shield protecting internet companies from liability over user-generated content. He has also expressed concern over market concentration and privacy issues in the technology industry; criticized Amazon for not paying taxes; and expressed displeasure with Facebook and its founder Mark Zuckerberg.  His two main advisors on tech policy include Bruce Reed, who served as Biden\u2019s chief of staff from 2011-13, and Stef Feldman, the campaign\u2019s policy director, according to a source with the Biden campaign. Reed and Feldman did not respond to requests for comment via the campaign.  A spokeswoman for Amazon said the company\u2019s PAC did not contribute to the Biden campaign. She said Amazon supported both the Democratic and Republican National Convention with technology and digital services to increase viewership.  \u201cWe work with each administration in the same way ... our approach will not change regardless of who wins the election,\u201d the spokeswoman added.  Biden campaign spokesman Matt Hill said Joe Biden is against the abuse of power. \u201cMany technology giants and their executives have not only abused their power, but misled the American people, damaged our democracy, and evaded any form of responsibility. That ends with a President Biden,\u201d Hill added.  Google declined comment. Microsoft said the contributions were made by its employees.  \u2018PROGRESSIVES WILL STRUGGLE\u2019  Tech\u2019s ties to Biden run deep.  Amazon\u2019s Carney worked in former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration as press secretary for a little over three years. He was Vice President Biden\u2019s communications director for the first two years of the Obama administration.  Amazon General Counsel David Zapolsky is a top fundraiser for Biden, also known as a bundler who as individuals have raised more than $25,000. Bundlers are sometimes rewarded with plum positions in their beneficiary\u2019s administration, such as key jobs in federal agencies and influential advisory commissions. Zapolsky has also directly contributed a little over $250,000 to different funds supporting Biden\u2019s presidency, according to campaign finance records. Zapolsky did not comment.  Meanwhile the Biden campaign\u2019s transition team and working groups have added at least eight people who worked for Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple and others with ties to these companies.  A senior policy counsel for a progressive Senate Democrat, who did not wish to be named, said Big Tech\u2019s closeness with the Biden campaign is worrying. The battle for the left wing of the Democratic party on this issue will be on whether they can get crucial appointments in the administration and less about moving Biden toward progressive options, the aide added.  Republican Senator Josh Hawley, a close ally of Trump and a vocal critic of large tech companies, said the progressives may get a \u201crhetorical nod in their direction now and then,\u201d but the Biden campaign\u2019s fundraising shows the progressives will struggle. \u201cFor Amazon in particular to be featured at a political convention is really, really worrisome,\u201d Hawley told Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s taking their lobbying to a whole new level.\u201d  To be sure, many large technology companies - their employees, PAC\u2019s or PAC members - have been top contributors to Democratic presidential campaigns in the past three election cycles, with one notable exception: Amazon. However, contributions from the Seattle-based retailer\u2019s employees have now made Amazon the fifth largest contributor to the Democratic nominee\u2019s candidate campaign committee, according to data from OpenSecrets and campaign finance records. Large technology companies are entirely missing from the Trump campaign committee\u2019s top 20 contributors list.  Donations from senior Amazon executives to the Biden campaign during the primaries were second only to Microsoft, according to data from the Revolving Door Project, which is part of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.  \u201cI think all the fundraising we are seeing is probably going to buy them (Amazon) access, but in terms of policy results, I think it\u2019s going to buy them very little,\u201d said an advisor on tech policy to the Biden campaign, who did not wish to be named. \u201cThere is a lot of collective outrage against tech in Washington these days, and they simply cannot fly under the radar.\u201d","109":"Sept 14 (Reuters) - ByteDance will not sell TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations to Oracle Corp or Microsoft Corp and will not give the source code for the video platform to any U.S. buyers, China\u2019s state-run English television channel CGTN reported on Monday, citing sources.

Smith said that Section 230 of the U.S. Communications Decency Act, which says that tech companies cannot be sued for what users of their online platforms say, was a needed law in the late 1990s when it first passed but that technology companies are now more mature and should have a \u201cnew level of responsibility\u201d for what is said on their sites.

Sony\u2019s PlayStation 5 is expected by analysts to outsell Microsoft\u2019s next-generation Xbox consoles when the devices launch in November, bolstered by Sony\u2019s stronger games pipeline including exclusives like \u201cMarvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales.\u201d  Microsoft\u2019s $7.5 billion acquisition of the publisher behind hit franchises like \u201cDoom\u201d and \u201cFallout\u201d helps close that gap, as it pushes into cloud gaming with the launch of a subscription service last week for Android devices.  The Xbox Game Pass is central to Microsoft\u2019s counterattack, with the rival PlayStation Now service from Sony - which has a dominant hardware install base - seen as lagging in terms of games on offer and by being limited to PlayStation and PC.

Alphabet\u2019s shares were off 0.07% in late morning trade.  COMMENTS:  DANIEL MORGAN, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SYNOVUS TRUST COMPANY  \u201cThis represents a major shift in the U.S. Justice Dept\u2019s stance towards Big-Tech Giants like Google. In the past all the rhetoric typically led to mild fines. This follows Facebook\u2019s July of 2018 record-breaking $5 billion penalty, to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that the company violated a 2012 FTC order by deceiving users about their ability to control the privacy of their personal information. In September of 2019, Google LLC and its subsidiary YouTube, paid a record $170 million to settle allegations by the Federal Trade Commission and the New York Attorney General that the YouTube video sharing service illegally collected personal information from children without their parents\u2019 consent. It looks like Alphabet will be forced to pay some additional fines going forward and submit plans to reconfigure its corporate structure to suffice the U.S. Justice Dept\u2019s concerns.\u201d  DAVID CICILLINE, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE ANTITRUST SUBCOMMITTEE, U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  \u201cAntitrust enforcement against Google is long overdue. The Subcommittee\u2019s investigation uncovered extensive evidence showing that Google maintained and extended its monopoly to harm competition. It is critical that the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit focuses on Google\u2019s monopolization of search and search advertising, while also targeting the anticompetitive business practices Google is using to leverage this monopoly into other areas, such as maps, browsers, video, and voice assistants.\u201d  DAVE HEGER, SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, EDWARD JONES  \u201cThe lawsuit will likely take years to be argued in court, and at this stage, the DOJ is not proposing any extreme remedial action, such as breaking apart the company. Such recommendations could be made, however, further into the proceedings. We feel that with over $120 billion of cash, Alphabet is financially able to fight the allegations and pay fines that might result from any government actions. We continue to feel positive about Google\u2019s long-term growth from search advertising, YouTube advertising, and cloud computing, and we are maintaining our Buy rating.\u201d  MICHAEL PURVES, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, TALLBACKEN CAPITAL ADVISORS, NEW YORK  \u201cThe market is ignoring this because it\u2019s sort of been factored in for a while. We\u2019ve seen these antitrust things, with Microsoft back several years ago, and we\u2019ve seen Google get slammed with these giant fines \u2013 basically it ends up being like parking tickets. Like in Europe, they get these multi-billion dollar fines, and it sucks, and they pay it, and then life goes on. So Google is going to litigate.

The deal enables Salesforce to provide a unified platform for businesses to connect their employees, customers and partners with each other and the apps they use, bolstering its enterprise portfolio.  For Slack, the deal comes as it struggles to fully capitalize on the switch to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Slack changed workplace communications by focusing on real-time messaging that could be broken into conversations with groups assembled on the fly, a more nimble platform than email.  But the messaging style that Slack helped create has become an extremely competitive space, with larger, older competitor Microsoft Corp aggressively promoting its similar Teams product with integrated video and voice calling.  Microsoft has also bundled Teams with many of its office software packages, an added attraction for companies looking to save costs during the disruption caused by the outbreak.  \u201cThe deal allows Salesforce to get deeper into collaboration and business communication and it\u2019s good for Slack, especially to grow their penetration into non-tech companies,\u201d DA Davidson analyst Rishi Jaluria said.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Slack shareholders will receive $26.79 in cash and 0.0776 shares of Salesforce common stock for each Slack share, or $45.5 per share based on Salesforce\u2019s closing price on Tuesday.  The offer represents a premium of 54% since the first report emerged last week about the deal talks.  Slack shares fell marginally to $43.73 in extended trading on Tuesday, while Salesforce\u2019s stock declined above 4%.  \u201c(Salesforce) shares will likely be range-bound in the short term given the large transaction, but we are believers in the benefits of this deal to CRM and see shares recovering,\u201d Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow said.  Separately, Salesforce reported third-quarter revenue of $5.42 billion, beating analysts\u2019 estimate of $5.25 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Silhouettes of mobile users are seen next to a screen projection of Google logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  It is Google's most extensive update to software in its G Suite workplace bundle since accelerating efforts to steal business from Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O dominant Office workplace software suite. Previously, G Suite added instant-messaging and spreadsheet features.  With Gmail, Google said it restructured email storage databases, unified three dueling systems for syncing messages across devices and upgraded computers underpinning the service. That shift to Google\u2019s self-developed Tensor processing chips enables smart-assistant features such as \u201csuggested replies\u201d to messages and \u201cnudges\u201d to respond to forgotten emails.  \u201cThis is an entire rewrite of our flagship, most-used product,\u201d said Jacob Bank, product manager lead for Gmail, which 1.4 billion people use each month.  Unreliable offline access to email has long discouraged would-be customers, while recent high-profile corporate data breaches have increased their desire to lock down email. Analysts estimate G Suite generated about $2 billion in revenue last year, 10 times behind Office.  Google declined to specify costs associated with the redesign. But parent Alphabet reported Monday that first-quarter capital expenditures nearly tripled year-over-year to $7.3 billion.  Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat told analysts that half of the spending resulted from hardware purchases to support expanding use of machine learning, which describes automated programs that can, among other things, identify spam and predict which emails users would find most important.  SECURITY AND SMARTS  Google\u2019s Bank said the overhaul was required primarily to provide offline access to up to 90 days of emails for users who turn on the feature.  The changes also fulfill another top demand of business executives - message expiration.  Users who enable a \u201cconfidential\u201d option when sending an email can time-limit its access to recipients and also require they enter a one-time passcode sent to their phones to read it.  The new setting does not override corporate email retention policies or present new obstacles to law enforcement.  \u201cNudges\u201d and a higher bar for new-mail notifications round out Google\u2019s revised sales pitch. The company estimated that nudges will lead 8 percent of business users each week to remember to follow-up on something important.  Cosmetic changes bring Gmail\u2019s website in line with Office by placing Google\u2019s calendar, tasks and note-taking services within the same page as emails.  Bank said testers have advanced from \u201cneutral to positive to very positive\u201d on the new look.","123":"(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp\u2019s Bing search engine was accessible for some internet users in mainland China late on Thursday, indicating that online access to the foreign technology service may have been restored within the country\u2019s Great Firewall.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Bing\u2019s website was accessible on mobile as well as broadband connections, though some users still reported occasional difficulties and it was not clear whether resumption to service was temporary or permanent.  Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It said on Wednesday that Bing had been blocked in China and that it was trying to determine its next steps.  Searches performed on Bing\u2019s China website at cn.bing.com from within mainland China on Wednesday directed users to a page saying the server could not be reached.  The government\u2019s Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) watchdog did not respond to faxed questions about Bing\u2019s blocked website.  Bing was the only major foreign search engine accessible from within China\u2019s so-called Great Firewall, with Microsoft censoring search results on sensitive topics, in accordance with Chinese government policy.  Its main competitor in mainland China is Baidu, which this week pledged to improve its media aggregating service after a complaint about the quality of the service and its search results went viral on social media.  Should Bing be blocked, it would mark Microsoft\u2019s second setback in China since November 2017, when its Skype internet phone call and messaging service was pulled from Apple and Android app stores.  Microsoft also has a partnership with Chinese data center provider 21Vianet to sell its Azure and Office 365 products.  Alphabet\u2019s Google search platform has been blocked in China since 2010. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in December that it has no plans to relaunch a search engine in China, though it is continuing to study the idea amid increased scrutiny of big technology firms.  China\u2019s President Xi Jinping has accelerated control of the internet in China since 2016 as the ruling Communist Party has sought to crack down on dissent on social media.  In a statement on Wednesday, the CAC said it had deleted more than 7 million pieces of online information and 9,382 mobile apps.  The watchdog also criticized technology company Tencent\u2019s news app for spreading \u201cvulgar information\u201d.","124":"FILE PHOTO: The Microsoft logo is pictured ahead of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 24, 2019.

FILE PHOTO: Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery in the Manhattan borough of New York City, January 29, 2016. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  Amazon will be the sole tenant in a new, modern eight-story office building that\u2019s nearing completion in the South African city, multiple sources familiar with the project told Reuters. The company is advertising dozens of jobs in Cape Town, which played a key role in the early development of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-computing business.  The adverts include one for a software development engineer that says Amazon is assembling a team for a \u201cgreen-field project\u201d dealing with machine learning, big data analysis and cloud computing, which are among the fastest-growing areas in the technology industry.  The company\u2019s expansion shows how fierce competition in the cloud business and rising demand for computing power are driving activity even in relatively undeveloped corners of the technology universe.  AWS is the global leader in cloud computing with 32 percent of the market, versus 16 percent for second-placed Microsoft in the first quarter of 2018, according to research firm Canalys. Microsoft has been growing faster.  The global cloud infrastructure services market was worth nearly $55 billion in 2017 and is expected to exceed $155 billion by 2020, Canalys said. AWS accounted for 73 percent of Amazon\u2019s $1.9 billion operating profit in the first quarter, but just 11 percent of its revenue.  Amazon\u2019s new Cape Town building is due for completion in August, according to a source familiar with the matter. It sits near an existing Amazon technical center and customer support operation.  Amazon did not offer details about the new building in Cape Town, or what its function might be.  \u201cAs more South African customers and partners continue to choose AWS as their cloud provider we continue to hire more staff into our offices in Cape Town and Johannesburg,\u201d Geoff Brown, AWS\u2019 Sub-Saharan Africa regional manager, told Reuters in a statement.  In another sign of Amazon\u2019s cloud-computing drive in South Africa, it is offering start-ups free cloud trials for one year, according to local entrepreneur Tumi Menyatswe - a deal that prompted her to switch to AWS from Google\u2019s cloud.  \u201cThis allows me to focus on my business and to grow until I can pay them,\u201d said Menyatswe, CEO of two-year-old business Minderz, which pairs pet owners with people able to look after cats and dogs during holidays.  EDGE IN AFRICA  It is difficult to measure the relative success of the big cloud-computing players in Africa, as they do not break out financial results for the continent. However, according to analysts, data centers are one measure of growth.  Despite its history on the continent, Amazon has yet to build a data center in Africa. Microsoft, by contrast, announced last year that it was building two data centers in South Africa, one in Cape Town and one in Johannesburg, both due to launch later this year.  Microsoft said in a statement that the plans were on track but would not specify when the data centers would be launched in 2018.  Local data centers offer advantages, in part by reducing \u201clatency\u201d, or delays, in data transmission. \u201cCloser is almost always better,\u201d said Carl Brooks, an analyst at 451 Research.  Clifford De Wit, former chief innovation officer at Microsoft South Africa, said a local data center was a big advantage.  \u201cHaving the actual data center close has so many implications,\u201d said De Wit, now chief technology officer at start-up Dexterity Digital. He cited privacy regulations that require banks and some other companies to store data locally, among other benefits.  Amazon\u2019s Brown told Reuters that South Africa was \u201cone of the many possibilities that we are currently looking at\u201d globally for opening a new data center.  He said the company launched new \u201cEdge\u201d locations -infrastructure that boosts transmission speeds from primary data centers outside the continent - in Johannesburg and Cape Town in the past two months. This will reduce latency for South African customers and bring other benefits, he said.  Famous for its Table Mountain and sandy beaches, Cape Town is emerging as a continental tech hub, with some 35,000 people employed in the sector, according to Wesgro, a trade and investment agency. The city boasts one of the largest publicly available fiber optic networks in Africa, local economic development officials say.  Amazon has played a key role in the city\u2019s internet industry from the start. Two South Africans, Chris Pinkham and Willem van Biljon, led a small Cape Town-based team that developed the key technical underpinnings of AWS, a software architecture known as EC2, and helped build the business plan for the service.  \u201cWe knew it was going to have a large impact,\u201d Van Biljon, who left Amazon more than a decade ago and still lives in Cape Town, told Reuters. \u201cThe rate at which the growth occurred outstripped even our best expectations.\u201d","126":"(Reuters) - Xbox maker Microsoft Corp MSFT.O said on Monday it would acquire ZeniMax Media for $7.5 billion in cash, its biggest gaming acquisition ever as it seeks to strengthen its video game offerings in its rivalry with Sony Corp's 6758.T PlayStation.

The game pass now has more than 15 million subscribers, up from the 10 million the company shared in April.  The deal comes more than a week after Microsoft's failed bid for short video app TikTok's U.S assets. TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance has structured the proposed deal as a partnership with Oracle ORCL.N and Walmart WMT.N, rather than an outright sale.  Bethesda\u2019s structure and leadership will remain in place, Microsoft said.  The gaming industry is on a tear as demand has surged from users stuck at home during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The deal would give Microsoft more hit titles in its gaming library, a big factor for gamers choosing a console.  \u201cMicrosoft recognizes its need for consumer based revenue growth, which we believe this deal will directly help drive along,\u201d brokerage Wedbush Securities said in a note.  Both Microsoft and Sony are launching their next-generation gaming devices in November, with pre-orders for Xbox going live on Tuesday.

But below the surface, the estimates reveal a wide range among the companies that comprise the S&P 500 information technology sector, which includes Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp as well as communications equipment, hardware and IT services companies.  The overall sector\u2019s earnings performance is being dragged down by semiconductors, which are expected to post a nearly 27% plunge in quarterly profits, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, as analysts point to impact from the U.S.-China tariff conflict and generally weak demand.  Growing business IT spending continues to support other pockets of tech, according to investors. Software firms are poised for a nearly 11% gain in profits from a year ago, according to the IBES data from Refinitiv.  \u201cYou may have two dynamics going on in tech in the opposite direction,\u201d said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio. \u201cCan software live up to the numbers and will semis beat the numbers?\u201d  Among software companies, Microsoft, the largest U.S. company by market value, reports results on Wednesday, while earnings are also due next week from semiconductor stalwarts Intel Corp and Texas Instruments Inc.  Other tech earnings next week include payment processors PayPal Holdings Inc and Visa Inc, with iPhone maker Apple, whose results ripple through its supply chain, expected to post a 2.7% drop in earnings when it reports the following week.  One of the early reporters, International Business Machines Corp, kicked off the season on a sour note on Wednesday, with quarterly revenue that missed estimates.  Even with the disparate forecasts for the third-quarter company results, tech stocks are outshining the market broadly in 2019.  The S&P 500 tech sector, which comprises over one-fifth of the benchmark index, has climbed more than 30% in 2019, compared to a 19% rise for the S&P 500.  Federal Reserve easing of interest rates has helped the performance, which comes despite uncertainty about the health of the global economy and about U.S.-China trade tensions.  Tech is \u201cthe primary growth engine of the economy,\u201d said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston.  \u201cChina is an issue for them, but at the same time they continue to grow and they continue to innovate,\u201d Joy said. \u201cYou have to have exposure in technology. We just think as you look around at the market landscape, it\u2019s one of the better places to be right now.\u201d  The tech sector\u2019s strength is broad-based, including gains so far this year of about 30% or more from the four biggest industry groups by market value within the tech sector: software , IT services, hardware, storage & peripherals and semiconductors.  \u201cThe IT budget continues to garner more dollars from the general budget of Corporate America,\u201d said Michael Seidenberg, portfolio manager for the global technology team at Allianz Global Investors. \u201cThere will be winners and losers within the sector, but I think generally speaking that is a trend that has persisted.\u201d  Of U.S. corporations, semiconductor makers are seen as among the most affected by the U.S.-China trade tensions, which have triggered big swings in their shares.  But the stocks still have prospered: the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index has climbed nearly 40% this year to all-time highs, while three chip stocks - KLA Corp , Lam Research Corp, Advanced Micro Devices Inc - are the tech sector\u2019s biggest 2019 gainers.  Despite the steep decline in third-quarter profits projected for S&P 500 semiconductor companies, analysts are optimistic there will be improvement soon, with semiconductors expected to post an 11% rise in 2020 earnings, according to Refinitiv data.  \u201cTo me, there\u2019s a huge disconnect between the performance of these names and the underlying fundamentals,\u201d said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust in Atlanta.  For software and other tech companies, the third quarter can be seasonally weak, said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh, who said she would be looking for executives to comment on whether business is being pushed back to future quarters.  But the strong employment market has supported tech stocks, Forrest said.  \u201cThis a phenomenon you see in the late stages of an expansion,\u201d Forrest said. \u201cHiring is up and to support all the new people that you\u2019ve hired, you to add to your technology.\u201d","128":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart Inc said it is pressing ahead with its goal to invest in TikTok as Oracle Corp takes the lead in a partnership with the Chinese video-sharing app.  FILE PHOTO: Walmart's logo is seen outside one of the stores in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., November 20, 2018. REUTERS\/Kamil Krzaczynski  On Sunday, Oracle beat Microsoft Corp in the battle for the U.S. arm of TikTok with a deal structured as a partnership rather than an outright sale to try to navigate geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington.  Walmart had teamed up with Microsoft on the unsuccessful bid.  ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s Chinese owner, had been in talks to divest the U.S. business of its hugely popular short-video app to Oracle or a consortium led by Microsoft after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the sale last month and said he might otherwise shut it down.  After Microsoft said it had been informed by ByteDance that the Chinese firm would not be selling it TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations, Walmart said it would talk further with ByteDance and \u201cother interested parties.\u201d  Asked on Monday whether the other parties include Oracle, a Walmart spokesman declined to comment.  For Walmart, a relationship with TikTok could supercharge the world\u2019s largest retailer\u2019s battle against Amazon.com Inc in e-commerce and online advertising.  But transforming TikTok from a platform where some 50 million U.S. daily users share short-form videos of people dancing and lip-synching into a shopping powerhouse will be a challenge for the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company, analysts say.  In the United States, TikTok advertisers currently place video ads for merchandise such as headphones or fast foods in-between user-uploaded videos. They can also pay for promoted \u201chashtag challenges,\u201d where users post videos about the brands\u2019 products.  In June, TikTok courted advertisers with a new program called \u201cTikTok For Business,\u201d which lets brands buy ads that appear when users first open the app. \u201cDon\u2019t make ads, make TikToks,\u201d the company told advertisers, which now include Nike Inc, eBay Inc and Colgate-Palmolive Co among others.  While TikTok is already on its way to building a robust advertising business, it has yet to articulate a comprehensive plan to sell goods on the app.  Rivals are far ahead. Facebook Inc has prioritized building out shopping and payments products in recent years across its suite of apps, which include fast-growing Instagram and WhatsApp as well as its namesake \u201cblue\u201d app, suggesting ambitions to emulate do-it-all Chinese super apps like WeChat. SOCIAL COMMERCE  If Walmart seeks inspiration on how to narrow the gap between TikTok and other big digital platforms and also catch up to Amazon, it need look no further than TikTok\u2019s Chinese counterpart.  Douyin, the ByteDance-owned app that resembles TikTok but is available only in China, started selling merchandise in 2017 and now operates a growing e-commerce operation where more than 400 million daily users shop.  Users can watch short videos and livestreams and make purchases directly through the store on the app or click on links to other e-commerce platforms from the videos. Creators are also encouraged to create shops within Douyin.  While Douyin has relied on and brought new business to China\u2019s big e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba, TikTok\u2019s e-commerce ambitions could be underpinned by Walmart.  The retailer has already accelerated e-commerce plans since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Walmart has explored new ways to court shoppers who make fewer trips to their stores. It has invested in curbside pickup and next-day and two-day deliveries.  But it could do much more, say analysts. Walmart could expand into so-called social commerce by hosting TikTok influencers\u2019 online storefronts, and enable shopping directly from the videos and livestreams, said Scott Smigler, president of e-commerce marketing agency Exclusive Concepts.  A partnership with TikTok, Smigler said, \u201cwould give Walmart a compelling edge over both Amazon and Google, who struggle to help consumers discover new products they didn\u2019t know they needed. That\u2019s the true power of social commerce.\u201d  All this could go a long way toward attracting a broader and younger audience. The average age of Walmart shoppers is 47, according to data provider Kantar.  \u201cTikTok is valuable because it\u2019s used every day by kids ... so as long as they (Walmart) gear their ads towards the audience on TikTok, it will be a success and they could be a real leader in advertising and e-commerce,\u201d said Randy Hare, portfolio manager at Huntington Private Bank. \u201cIf they start advertising yard tools and things like that, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll get much traction.\u201d","129":"(Reuters) - S&P 500 dividends are likely to fall about 1% this year, much less than previously expected, as companies reinstate previously suspended payments as they become more confident about recovering from the coronavirus, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.

The selection leaves Oracle Corp and IBM Corp out of the competition for the contract for the Defense Department\u2019s Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, or JEDI. The contract is part of a broad modernization of Pentagon information technology systems.  \u201cI can confirm that AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Microsoft are the companies that met the minimum requirements outlined\u201d in the Request for Proposals, department spokeswoman Elissa Smith said in a statement.  The Pentagon said in its request for bidders last year that the contract for cloud computing services could be worth as much as $10 billion over a 10-year period.

AWS at the time was the only company approved by the government to handle secret and top secret data.  Smith said the earliest a contract was likely to be awarded was mid-July, mainly because of the size and complexity of the deal, potential protest litigation and an ongoing investigation.  Oracle has expressed concern about the role of a former Amazon employee who worked on the JEDI project until recusing himself, then later left the Defense Department and returned to Amazon Web Services.  Smith said a department review of the acquisitions process did uncover potential ethical violations, which have been referred to the Defense Department\u2019s inspector general for further investigation.

REUTERS\/Kim Hong-Ji  SEOUL (Reuters) - For Hyundai, the South Korean conglomerate, North Korea has been a story of lost opportunities \u2013 and tragedy.  In 2003, months before Hyundai was set to open an industrial complex in North Korea, the executive behind the project committed suicide amid accusations his company had made a secret $500 million payment to the North.  Five years later, a Hyundai-run resort in the North was closed after a North Korean soldier shot a South Korean tourist.  Both projects have long been shuttered, symbolizing the difficulties South Korean companies have had doing business across the border.  But, emboldened by a thawing of relations on the Korean peninsula and attracted by its promise of cheap labor and untapped growth, Hyundai is again preparing to return to North Korea.  Hyundai executives and investors are encouraged by a pledge by Seoul and Pyongyang to re-open the Kaesong industrial park and the Mt. Kumgang resort as part of a warming in ties between the neighbors.  International sanctions over the North\u2019s nuclear weapons program make it unclear how quickly investments can resume. But executives and investors are betting Hyundai stands to benefit the most from any peace dividend on the Korean peninsula.  \u201cWe have invested a lot for a long time, and have a solid and wide network and business rights there,\u201d said Baek Cheon-ho, a senior executive at Hyundai Asan, the subsidiary that managed the Kaesong and Mt. Kumgang projects. \u201cCombining all that, Hyundai will eventually be better off in North Korea.\u201d  For Korea Inc, struggling with high labor costs and slowing growth, North Korea\u2019s cheap labor, vast resources and huge growth potential represent an unmissable opportunity, Baek and several business executives told Reuters.  For Hyundai and its ruling family, North Korea also has symbolic importance. Founder Chung Ju-yung was born to a peasant family in Asan, North Korea and named the subsidiary to handle the group\u2019s enterprises after his birthplace.  \u201cWe\u2019re doing this not only for Hyundai, but for the greater good of all South Korean companies,\u201d Baek said. \u201cIf we restart our North Korea businesses, there will be many new jobs for us, but also for a number of other firms working with us.\u201d  EBB AND FLOW  Hyundai\u2019s ebb and flow in North Korea also illustrate how it could again become one of the biggest casualties from any setback in international efforts to get Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear program.  Other South Korean conglomerates such as Samsung and Lotte have made smaller bets on North Korea and will need to start from scratch if economic ties resume. Both have set up taskforces in recent months to explore opportunities.  Shares of unlisted Hyundai Asan have nearly quadrupled to a record high in over-the-counter trading this year.  Other companies such as train maker Hyundai Rotem, builder Hyundai Engineering & Construction and Hyundai Elevator, have also surged as the two Koreas work towards officially ending their 1950-53 conflict.  \u201cStocks like Hyundai Elevator are now going up and down driven by anticipation and headline news, rather than fundamentals,\u201d said Lee Gun-min, a fund manager at BNK Asset Management. \u201cBut we think there is a better chance and visibility about economic cooperation than in the past since the two Koreas are now talking about ending the war.\u201d  Lee manages a \u201cUnification Fund\u201d for his investment firm, targeting stocks with potential exposure to North Korea, mostly Hyundai companies such as Hyundai Elevator but also banks and logistics firms.  \u2018LIFELINE\u2019  South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has pushed for rapprochement with the North since his election last year, calls the Kaesong industrial park a \u201clifeline\u201d for South Korea.  Asia\u2019s fourth-biggest economy is being squeezed globally between high-end, innovative manufacturers and low-cost producers in China and elsewhere.  Before the 2016 closure of Kaesong, some 120 South Korean companies employed 55,000 North Korean workers there, making everything from clothes and kitchen utensils to electronic components. The North Korean workers were well qualified, hard working and cost just a fraction of what workers in the South were paid, factory owners said.  Almost all small and medium enterprises which used to operate in Kaesong said they would like to go back, according to an April survey.  Seven out of 10 South Korean companies would prefer to use North Korean workers instead of foreign migrants due to language barriers and high costs associated with hiring foreign labor, a separate survey by the Korea Federation of SMEs found.  Hyundai Asan has the most riding on the prospect of a peaceful peninsula.  It paid $1.2 billion to buy exclusive rights for Kaesong and Mt. Kumgang, and has interests in railroads and infrastructure projects including reconnecting inter-Korean railways.  Hyundai Asan\u2019s rights to land the size of Manhattan in Kaesong last for 50 years, and it has a plan to build an even bigger factory town if the complex reopens, accommodating 2,000 companies and 350,000 North Korean workers.  Less than 5 percent of the total property in Kaesong has been developed currently, Hyundai told Reuters.  Officials say Hyundai has also agreed with the North to run tours in the coastal city of Wonsan, which North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is trying to build into a hotspot for tourism and foreign investment, as well as Mt. Paektu, the mythical homeland of both Koreas.  Hyundai\u2019s Baek said the company is also in talks with Seoul and state-run corporations about projects to reconnect railroads between the North and South.  \u201cThe government respects Hyundai\u2019s business rights it signed with the North,\u201d said a spokeswoman at South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry, who did not respond to a question about its discussions with Hyundai.  NO LOVE FROM WASHINGTON  South Korean government officials and business executives say the biggest hurdle is opposition from Washington, which wants to maintain sanctions until Pyongyang completely denuclearizes.  In July, Mark Lambert, director for Korean affairs at the U.S. State Department, called about 10 South Korean businessmen for a meeting at the U.S. embassy in Seoul to deliver a stern message: No resumption of any businesses until denuclearization.  \u201cThe mood in the room was bleak,\u201d said SJ Tech Chairman Yoo Chang-geun, who used to operate a factory at Kaesong and attended the meeting.  Baek, who was also present, unsuccessfully argued Kaesong and Mt. Kumgang should be waived from sanctions \u201cto show our goodwill to North Korea\u201d.  A spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department declined to comment on details of \u201cprivate diplomatic conversations\u201d.  Hyundai\u2019s relationship with North Korea goes back a long way.  Hyundai founder Chung drove 500 head of cattle across the border to the North in 1998 to aid reconciliation on the divided peninsula.  Kim Jong Il, the late father of Kim Jong Un, was quoted as saying: \u201cOur first love is Hyundai when it comes to North-South relations, a way earlier than with (South Korean) authorities,\u201d according to a North Korean book titled \u201cPatriots Who Left Their Names On Path To Unification\u201d.  But the suspension of its North Korea projects left Hyundai Asan with combined losses of $367 million in the past decade.  Hyundai admitted it paid North Korean authorities $500 million in 2000 to secure business rights there.  Two days after being questioned by prosecutors over the scandal, Chung Ju-yung\u2019s son and successor, Chung Mong-hun fell to his death from Hyundai headquarters. Indictments against him were dropped after his death.  The Supreme Court gave Hyundai Asan\u2019s then chief executive a suspended jail term for violating foreign money transfer rules, but he was later pardoned.  The widow of the younger Chung now heads Hyundai Asan\u2019s parent group and visited Pyongyang in September as part of a South Korean delegation for a summit between Moon and Kim.  \u201cThere are many hurdles to be overcome, but I feel there is hope ahead of us,\u201d Hyun Jeong-eun said.

They will also work together to let joint users log into to services from either company with a single user name and get tech support from either company.  The move comes as both Oracle and Microsoft are courting large businesses and government customers considering moving computing tasks currently handled in their own data centers to cloud providers.  \u201cWith Oracle\u2019s enterprise expertise, this alliance is a natural choice for us as we help our joint customers accelerate the migration of enterprise applications and databases to the public cloud,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s cloud chief Scott Guthrie said in a statement.  AWS, the largest cloud computing provider, is encroaching on many of those customers, including in Oracle\u2019s historical stronghold in the database market.  \u201cWith this alliance, our joint customers can migrate their entire set of existing applications to the cloud without having to re-architect anything, preserving the large investments they have already made,\u201d Don Johnson, executive vice president of Oracle\u2019s cloud infrastructure unit, said in a statement.  Microsoft has previously inked a deal with German software maker SAP SE and Adobe Inc to make their services work better together.  Ed Anderson, an analyst with research firm Gartner, said the move was a clear \u201cjab\u201d at AWS, especially for Oracle. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that Oracle views AWS as a major competitor in the database market,\u201d he said.

FILE PHOTO: China and U.S. flags are seen near a TikTok logo in this illustration picture taken July 16, 2020. REUTERS\/Florence Lo\/Illustration\/File Photo  The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a U.S. government panel that reviews deals for potential national security risks, has given ByteDance until Sept. 15 to negotiate a sale of TikTok to Microsoft Corp, amid concerns over the safety of personal data that the app handles under its Chinese parent.  Microsoft has said it is seeking to buy the assets of TikTok in North America, Australia and New Zealand. It has not disclosed how much it is willing to pay, though sources previously told Reuters that ByteDance executives value all of TikTok at more than $50 billion.  \u201cA very substantial portion of that price is going to have to come into the Treasury of the United States because we\u2019re making it possible for this deal to happen,\u201d Trump told reporters on Monday.  CFIUS legislation gives the U.S. government broad authority to seek mitigation from companies that are jeopardizing national security, legal experts said.  While CFIUS has never before sought a cut from the proceeds of a divestiture it has ordered, the White House could argue that imposing a fee on Bytedance would deprive it of resources that would otherwise support China\u2019s government on technology initiatives that could harm U.S. interests, some of the legal experts added.  \u201cIt\u2019s certainly inconsistent with the intent of Congress ... and with CFIUS\u2019s long-standing concern to maintain a reputation for acting apolitically and solely on grounds of national security, but it\u2019s not clear that it\u2019s outside the president\u2019s statutory authority,\u201d said Paul Marquardt, a regulatory lawyer at Cleary Gottlieb.  The White House, the Treasury Department, Bytedance and Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  U.S. law states that presidential decisions blocking deals on national security grounds are not subject to judicial reviews. However, a legal challenge is possible under the fifth amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits the government from seizing property without just compensation, as well as other laws, legal experts said.  While a previous fifth amendment challenge to a CFIUS order had limited success, this would be the first time a challenge could be mounted against the U.S. government imposing a deal fee, the experts added.  \u201cThis is akin to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act but on U.S. soil, where the U.S. government would be able to require what is tantamount to a bribe in order to obtain a regulatory approval for a business transaction,\u201d DLA Piper lawyer Nicholas Klein said.  It is not clear if Trump will make good on his demand for a slice of the TikTok deal proceeds. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a specific concept that will be followed through,\u201d White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Fox Business News on Tuesday.","148":"Feb 4 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Thursday it was investigating an issue faced by Teams users in North America while trying to access meetings.

Microsoft said in the post it was a \u201cstrong supporter\u201d of the California Consumer Privacy Act, known as CCPA, which will go into effect on Jan. 1.  The California law is widely expected to harm profits over the long term for technology companies, retailers, advertising firms and other businesses dependent on collecting consumer data to track users and increase sales.  The law raised fears among companies of a rise in a patchwork of state laws and prompted efforts in Washington to write federal legislation that would pre-empt state efforts.  In September, Reuters was first to report reut.rs\/2X4zhp0 that the federal privacy bill is not likely to come before Congress this year as lawmakers disagreed over several issues.  \u201cUnder CCPA, companies must be transparent about data collection and use, and provide people with the option to prevent their personal information from being sold. Exactly what will be required under CCPA to accomplish these goals is still developing,\u201d Julie Brill, Microsoft\u2019s chief privacy officer, wrote in the post.  \u201cMicrosoft will continue to monitor those changes, and make the adjustments needed to provide effective transparency and control under CCPA to all people in the U.S.,\u201d Brill wrote.  Microsoft products that collect data include its Cortana and Microsoft Edge browsers, Bing web search engine, Windows 10 system, Xbox and Skype.  A source familiar with the matter said it may be easier for Microsoft than other tech platforms to comply with California\u2019s privacy laws because much of Microsoft\u2019s business can qualify as a \u201cservice provider.\u201d CCPA offers special treatment to companies that can classify themselves as \u201cservice providers.\u201d  A service provider is defined as having a written agreement with a business, stating that it will not retain, use, or disclose the personal information of consumers for any purpose other than for a specific purpose set forth in the contract.  Service providers are one of three types of entities generally affected by the CCPA. The others are businesses and third parties.  There are certain advantages to being considered a service provider as opposed to a third party.  For instance, if a business shares personal information with a third party, that can trigger certain disclosures that must be made to the consumer. Such third parties also must provide notice to consumers before selling personal information they receive, which in turn could allow consumers to opt out. Transferring personal information to a service provider, by contrast, does not necessarily trigger those additional obligations, making it easier to comply with the law.

Pope Francis, who has raised concerns about the uncontrolled spread of AI technologies, gave his backing in a speech read on his behalf at a conference attended by Microsoft president Brad Smith MSFT.O and IBM IBM.N Executive Vice President John Kelly. The pope is ill and could not deliver the address himself.  Calling for the ethical development of algorithms, known as \u201calgor-ethics\u201d, Francis warned about the dangers of AI being used to extract data for commercial or political ends, often without the knowledge of individuals.  \u201cThis asymmetry, by which a select few know everything about us while we know nothing about them, dulls critical thought and the conscious exercise of freedom,\u201d he said in his message.  \u201cInequalities expand enormously; knowledge and wealth accumulate in a few hands with grave risks for democratic societies,\u201d he said.  The joint document made a specific reference to the potential abuse of facial recognition technology.  \u201cNew forms of regulation must be encouraged to promote transparency and compliance with ethical principles, especially for advanced technologies that have a higher risk of impacting human rights, such as facial recognition,\u201d the document said.  Police have used facial recognition systems to investigate crimes, and Fortune 500 companies have used AI to vet job applicants - both examples of high-stakes tasks where deploying inaccurate or biased software could lead to harm.  It was not immediately clear whether other technology companies might sign up to the document, or how signatories would implement the principles.  IBM, for example, wants a doctor to be in the loop when its AI technology makes healthcare recommendations - something that may increase over time following a deal with the Vatican-owned Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children\u2019s Hospital in Rome.  That partnership will focus on developing technology to speed up diagnosis and treatment of brain tumor patients.  Both IBM and Microsoft have said they turned down business when they felt uncomfortable with how a customer wanted to use their technology.  The Rome conference was the latest example of the Vatican trying to stay ahead of the curve on technology and social issues in order to influence the pioneers of the future, regardless of their religion.  Vatican officials have said they could provide material for a possible papal document on AI, much as meetings with scientists helped shape the pope\u2019s landmark 2015 encyclical \u201cLaudato Si\u201d on the protection of the environment.

At its current price of about $437 a share, the tech giant is now about $132 billion - or around $30 a share - short of hitting $2 trillion in market capitalization.  Tech far outpaced gains among the 11 S&P 500 sectors in morning trading.  A rally in tech-related stocks and historic stimulus have lifted the S&P 500 to within 4% of its peak, but faltering macroeconomic data and a gridlock on more government stimulus have made investors cautious again.

In an interview with Reuters, Gates said the millions of online posts and \u201ccrazy conspiracy theories\u201d about him and about top U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci had likely taken hold in part because of the combination of a frightening viral pandemic and the rise of social media.  \u201cNobody would have predicted that I and Dr. Fauci would be so prominent in these really evil theories,\u201d Gates said.  \u201cI\u2019m very surprised by that.

Since the pandemic began a year ago, millions of conspiracies have spread over the Internet, fuelling misinformation about the coronavirus, its origins and the motives of those working to fight it.

The deal is a big bet on Azure, the company\u2019s fast-growing cloud business, as it will be able to lure more code developers who use GitHub and drive more business to Microsoft.  By pulling off its largest acquisition since the $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn in 2016, Microsoft gets a platform universally known by developers. GitHub calls itself the world\u2019s largest code host with more than 28 million developers using its platform.  After reports of a likely deal between Microsoft and GitHub emerged on Sunday, some users of the software development platform raised doubts on social network Reddit here that GitHub would \"eventually favor Microsoft products over competing alternatives.\"  But Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella downplayed those concerns by saying on a conference call that GitHub will continue to be an open platform that works with all public clouds.  He said Microsoft will use GitHub to promote company\u2019s own developer tools and use its sales team to speed up adoption of GitHub by its big business customers.  The deal reflects the company\u2019s ongoing pivot to open source software and seeks to further broaden its large and growing development community, Moody\u2019s analyst Richard Lane said.  It\u2019s also a smart move by Microsoft, which has seen scorching growth in its cloud business over the past few years. Azure posted a 93 percent jump in revenue in the third quarter ended March 31.  Last year, the software giant shut down CodePlex, its own rival for GitHub, saying the latter was the dominant location for open source sharing and that most such projects had already migrated there.  After closing the acquisition, expected by the end of the calendar year, GitHub will become a part of Microsoft\u2019s Intelligent Cloud unit.  Microsoft\u2019s Nat Friedman will take over as the Chief Executive Officer of San Francisco-headquartered GitHub, whose current CEO Chris Wanstrath will become a Microsoft technical fellow.  On an adjusted basis, Microsoft expects the deal to add to its operating income in fiscal 2020 and reduce earnings per share by less than 1 percent in 2019 and 2020.

Trump\u2019s comments confirmed a Reuters report Sunday that he had agreed to give China\u2019s ByteDance 45 days to negotiate a sale of popular short-video app TikTok to Microsoft.  Trump also said the U.S. Treasury would need to get a lot of money out of a TikTok deal, but it not clear how that would happen.

The figure was cited by plaintiffs suing Microsoft for systematically denying pay raises or promotions to women at the world\u2019s largest software company. Microsoft denies it had any such policy.  The lawsuit, filed in Seattle federal court in 2015, is attracting wider attention after a series of powerful men have left or been fired from their jobs in entertainment, the media and politics for sexual misconduct.  Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys are pushing to proceed as a class action lawsuit, which could cover more than 8,000 women. More details about Microsoft\u2019s human resources practices were made public on Monday in legal filings submitted as part of that process.  The two sides are exchanging documents ahead of trial, which has not been scheduled.  Out of 118 gender discrimination complaints filed by women at Microsoft, only one was deemed \u201cfounded\u201d by the company, according to details in the unsealed court filings.  Attorneys for the women called the number of complaints \u201cshocking\u201d in the court filings and the response by Microsoft\u2019s investigations team \u201clackluster.\u201d  Companies generally keep information about internal discrimination complaints private, so it is unclear how the number of complaints at Microsoft compares to competitors.  Microsoft said in court filings that the plaintiffs did not identify practices that impact enough employees to warrant a class action, and that it spends more than $55 million per year to promote diversity and inclusion. The company had about 74,000 U.S. employees at the end of last year.  Microsoft said the plaintiffs cannot cite one example of a pay or promotion problem in which Microsoft\u2019s investigations team should have found a violation of company policy, but did not. A Microsoft spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment.  U.S. District Judge James Robart has not yet ruled on the plaintiffs\u2019 request for class action status.  A Reuters review of federal court cases filed between 2006 and 2016 revealed hundreds containing sexual harassment allegations where companies used common civil litigation tactics to keep potentially damning information under wraps.  Microsoft had argued that the number of womens\u2019 human resources complaints should be kept secret because publicizing the outcomes could deter employees from reporting future abuses.  A court-appointed official found that scenario \u201cfar too remote a competitive or business harm\u201d to justify keeping the information sealed.

For example, at end-to-end encryption messaging service Wickr, which offers fully encrypted video calls with as many as 50 participants, business sales have more than doubled each week for a month, said Chief Executive Joel Wallenstrom.  Wickr typically serves executives or security teams within a large company who want its encryption to discuss financial or government secrets, rather than displacing Teams, Zoom or Slack.  \u201cWe had a customer that had 150 core users,\u201d Wallenstrom said. \u201cBut when there wasn\u2019t a lot they could do out of the office, so they went to 80,000 in two weeks.\u201d  Slack said last month that simultaneously connected users increased to 12.5 million on March 25 from 10 million on March 10.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  In an email to employees publicly released late on Thursday, Microsoft Chief People Officer Kathleen Hogan said Microsoft had 83 harassment complaints in 2017 out of a U.S.-based workforce of over 65,000 employees.  Nearly 50 percent were found to be supported at least in part following an investigation, she said, and more than half of those resulted in the termination of an employee who engaged in unacceptable behavior.  The unusual publication of such data comes as the world\u2019s largest software company is defending a lawsuit which alleges it systematically denied pay raises or promotions to women. Microsoft denies it has ever had such a policy.  The lawsuit, filed in Seattle federal court in 2015, is attracting wider attention after a series of powerful men have left or been fired from their jobs in entertainment, the media and politics for sexual misconduct.  Microsoft also investigated 84 complaints of gender discrimination last year, Hogan said, and found around 10 percent of those to be supported at least in part.  Earlier this week, Reuters reported on the contents of unsealed court documents which showed that out of 118 gender discrimination complaints filed by women in U.S.-based technical jobs at Microsoft between 2010 and 2016, only one was deemed \u201cfounded\u201d by the company.  Attorneys for the women described the number of complaints as \u201cshocking\u201d in the court filings, and said the response by Microsoft\u2019s investigations team was \u201clackluster.\u201d  Hogan\u2019s email on Thursday linked to the Reuters story and said the numbers cited by plaintiffs were misleading.  \u201cReports that we rarely reach a conclusion in favor of the complainant are based on a faulty reading of a partial data set,\u201d Hogan wrote.  Hogan\u2019s email did not provide additional figures about the time period cited in the court documents.

The Xbox Series X - which the company has described as the \u201cworld\u2019s most powerful console\u201d - will retail for $499.99 and a lower-priced Xbox Series S will sell for $299.99.  The strategy offers consumers greater choice but the compact Series S faces criticism for being less powerful than the Series X, with less storage capacity and lacking advanced \u201cray tracing\u201d graphics for titles like Capcom\u2019s \u201cDevil May Cry 5.\u201d  Xbox will compete with Sony Corp\u2019s PlayStation 5, scheduled to launch on Thursday. PS5 is widely viewed as leading the console race due to its bigger fan base and a broader range of exclusive gaming titles available at launch.  This was the first time Microsoft launched its gaming console globally on the same day and the company said it has seen the highest preorders for Xbox consoles across various markets.  While the initial supply of preorders sold out fast, Microsoft had said additional stocks would be available at launch.  \u201cThere were some early supply chain issues in Q1\/Q2 due to Chinese manufacturing plants shutting down due to COVID, but these have since been operating normally again,\u201d said analyst Maurice Klaehne at research firm Counterpoint.  Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service with more than 100 titles including brand new games, is seen as the company\u2019s greatest weapon for cutting in to PlayStation\u2019s dominance. Game Pass has grown rapidly to more than 15 million users since its launch.  However, Xbox is seen as lacking killer launch titles, with the latest \u201cHalo\u201d game in the flagship series pushed back to next year as the pandemic hit development.  \u201cEach studio is facing unique challenges and constraints depending on its particular location, and many of our external development partners around the world are similarly affected,\u201d said Ryan Cameron, director at Xbox, EMEA.","187":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Adobe Inc and Microsoft Corp are partnering to bolster each other\u2019s sales and marketing software capabilities, taking aim at common rival Salesforce.com Inc, they said on Tuesday.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Adobe and Microsoft hope to make it easier for users of Adobe\u2019s marketing software to find and target teams of potential customers for business goods on LinkedIn, the social network owned by Microsoft, they said at a conference in Las Vegas.  If an Adobe customer is selling medical equipment to a hospital, for example, the new partnership would make it easier to target tailored LinkedIn ads to all of the people involved in the purchasing decision, such as doctors, technicians and finance managers. If the marketing campaign works, sales people could then use Microsoft\u2019s sales software to help close the deal.  \u201cThe LinkedIn network is one of those clear holy grails\u201d for business marketers, Steve Lucas, senior vice president of digital experience at Adobe and former chief executive officer of Marketo, a business-to-business marketing software firm that Adobe acquired last year for $4.75 billion, told Reuters. \u201cIt has just become such a huge lever for B-to-B marketers that it would be impossible for us to ignore it.\u201d  Long known as the maker of content creation tools such as Photoshop, Adobe has in recent years turned to making the software used for marketing campaigns, which rely heavily on the content created with its software.  Most of Adobe\u2019s tools were for marketers trying to reach consumers, but the Marketo acquisition last year bolstered its software for business marketers.  While Microsoft is best known for its Window operating system and Office program, it is also working to grow a business called Dynamics 365, software used by sales people to track deals. Its $26 billion acquisition in 2016 of LinkedIn, perhaps the most common tool used by sales people trying to drum up business, was a key piece of the effort here.  In doing so, both are taking on Salesforce, the cloud software company that offers sales and marketing software, where Adobe and Microsoft lack one or the other.  But by integrating their systems, Adobe and Microsoft can offer something arguably \u201ca lot broader\u201d because Adobe software is how most marketing content gets made, said Melissa Webster, program vice president for content and digital media technologies at research firm IDC.  \u201cThere\u2019s no question that Microsoft and Adobe both have a lot to gain from teaming up against Salesforce,\u201d Webster said.

The Redmond, Washington company is a user of Orion, the widely deployed networking management software from SolarWinds Corp which was used in the suspected Russian attacks on vital U.S. agencies and others.  Microsoft also had its own products leveraged to attack victims, said people familiar with the matter. The U.S. National Security Agency issued a rare \u201ccybersecurity advisory\u201d Thursday detailing how certain Microsoft Azure cloud services may have been compromised by hackers and directing users to lock down their systems.  \u201cLike other SolarWinds customers, we have been actively looking for indicators of this actor and can confirm that we detected malicious Solar Winds binaries in our environment, which we isolated and removed,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson said, adding that the company had found \u201cno indications that our systems were used to attack others.\u201d  One of the people familiar with the hacking spree said the hackers made use of Microsoft cloud offerings while avoiding Microsoft\u2019s corporate infrastructure.  Microsoft did not immediately respond to questions about the technique.  Still, another person familiar with the matter said the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) does not believe Microsoft was a key avenue of fresh infection.  Both Microsoft and the DHS, which earlier on Thursday said the hackers used multiple methods of entry, are continuing to investigate.  The FBI and other agencies have scheduled a classified briefing for members of Congress Friday.  The U.S. Energy Department also said it has evidence hackers gained access to its networks as part of the campaign. Politico had earlier reported the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), which manages the country\u2019s nuclear weapons stockpile, was targeted.  An Energy Department spokeswoman said malware \u201chas been isolated to business networks only\u201d and has not impacted U.S. national security, including the NNSA.  The DHS said in a bulletin on Thursday the hackers had used other techniques besides corrupting updates of network management software by SolarWinds which is used by hundreds of thousands of companies and government agencies.  CISA urged investigators not to assume their organizations were safe if they did not use recent versions of the SolarWinds software, while also pointing out that the hackers did not exploit every network they gained access too.  FILE PHOTO: A Microsoft logo is seen on an office building in New York City on July 28, 2015. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo\/File Photo  CISA said it was continuing to analyze the other avenues used by the attackers. So far, the hackers are known to have at least monitored email or other data within the U.S. departments of Defense, State, Treasury, Homeland Security and Commerce.  As many as 18,000 Orion customers downloaded the updates that contained a back door, SolarWinds has said. Since the campaign was discovered, software companies have cut off communication from those back doors to the computers maintained by the hackers.  But the attackers might have installed additional ways of maintaining access, CISA said, in what some have called the biggest hack in a decade.  The Department of Justice, FBI and Defense Department, among others, have moved routine communication onto classified networks that are believed not to have been breached, according to two people briefed on the measures. They are assuming that the non-classified networks have been accessed, the people said.  CISA and private companies including FireEye Inc, which was the first to discover and reveal it had been hacked, have released a series of clues for organizations to look for to see if they have been hit.  But the attackers are very careful and have deleted logs, or electronic footprints or which files they have accessed, security experts said. That makes it hard to know what has been taken.  Some major companies have said they have \u201cno evidence\u201d that they were penetrated, but in some cases that may only be because the evidence was removed.  In most networks, the attackers would also have been able to create false data, but so far it appears they were interested only in obtaining real data, people tracking the probes said.  Meanwhile, members of Congress are demanding more information about what may have been taken and how, along with who was behind it. The House Homeland Security Committee and Oversight Committee announced an investigation Thursday, while senators pressed to learn whether individual tax information was obtained.  In a statement, President-elect Joe Biden said he would \u201celevate cybersecurity as an imperative across the government\u201d and \u201cdisrupt and deter our adversaries\u201d from undertaking such major hacks.","192":"SEOUL, Nov 15 (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Friday the Pentagon awarded Microsoft Corp an up to $10 billion cloud computing contract after a fair competition, after Amazon.com Inc announced plans to challenge it over alleged bias.  \u201cI am confident it was conducted freely and fairly without any type of outside influence,\u201d Esper told a news conference in Seoul.

Some companies were concerned that a single award would give the winner an unfair advantage in follow-on work. The Pentagon has said it planned to award future cloud deals to multiple contractors.  This week, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper removed himself from reviewing the deal due to his adult son's employment with one of the original contract applicants, IBM Corp IBM.N. IBM had previously bid for the contract but had already been eliminated from the competition.  Microsoft said it was working on a comment. IBM and Oracle did not immediately return requests for comment.  In a book slated for publication Oct. 29, retired Navy commander Guy Snodgrass, who served as a speech writer to former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, said Trump called Mattis and directed him to \u201cscrew Amazon\u201d by preventing it from bidding on the JEDI contract, according to an excerpt of the book seen by Reuters ahead of its release.  \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do that,\u201d Mattis later told other Pentagon officials, according to the excerpt. \u201cThis will be done by the book, both legally and ethically.\u201d  Snodgrass declined to comment pending the release of his book.  In a statement announcing Microsoft as the winner, the Pentagon underscored its view that the competition was conducted fairly and legally.  \u201cAll (offers) were treated fairly and evaluated consistently with the solicitation\u2019s stated evaluation criteria. Prior to the award, the department conferred with the DOD Inspector General, which informed the decision to proceed,\u201d it said.  Microsoft shares were up 3% to $144.98 in after-hours trading after the news. Amazon shares were down 0.92% to $1,745.12.  The Pentagon said it had awarded more than $11 billion across 10 separate cloud contracts over the past two years.  \u201cAs we continue to execute the DOD Cloud Strategy, additional contracts are planned for both cloud services and complementary migration and integration solutions necessary to achieve effective cloud adoption,\u201d the Pentagon said.","202":"(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Sunday unveiled its next-generation Xbox console, known as \u201cProject Scarlett,\u201d which is set to hit store shelves during the 2020 holiday season.  The device will be four times more powerful than the Xbox One X console and be powered by an Advanced Micro Devices chip, the company said during its Xbox E3 conference in Los Angeles.  The console will show up to 120 frames per second, or twice the average TV, and include a solid-state drive, Microsoft said, allowing games to load much faster than on its older mechanical hard drives.  The latest version of Microsoft\u2019s popular \u201cHalo\u201d videogame will be launched along with the new console.  Rival Sony Corp has also revealed plans of its next-generation PlayStation 5 console, with similar specifications including an AMD chip, but no official release date has been announced. Analysts expect a late 2020 release.  Microsoft said its game-streaming service \u201cProject xCloud\u201d will go into preview in October. Rival Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google on Thursday started taking pre-orders for its Stadia game-streaming service which will launch in November.  A new feature will allow users to stream games directly from their own Xbox console, instead of Microsoft\u2019s servers, the company said.  \u201cTwo months ago we connected all Xbox developers to Project xCloud,\u201d Phil Spencer, Microsoft\u2019s executive vice president for gaming, said. \u201cNow, the console streaming service will \u201cturn your Xbox One into your own personal and free xCloud server.\u201d  \u201cWhether you\u2019re using a console in our data center or your console at home, this October you\u2019ll be able to use our hybrid gaming cloud to play your games wherever you go. Where you play is now entirely your choice,\u201d Spencer said.  The company announced \u201cProject xCloud\u201d last October saying it was testing a new game streaming service designed to work across PCs, consoles and mobile devices.  Since then, Microsoft has revealed that the service uses hardware similar to that in its existing Xbox One gaming consoles.  \u201cThat means an existing library of more than 3,500 games will work on the service without any changes or modifications required by the developer,\u201d Microsoft said in a blog post in May.  Analysts have said Microsoft is better positioned than most to capitalize on cloud gaming, citing its strength in infrastructure, content it owns, and experience in gaming.  Several technology companies are looking to boost services revenue through games streaming, including Nvidia Corp, Sony and Electronic Arts while Amazon.com Inc is reportedly working on its own service as well.","203":"A federal judge on Friday narrowed a batch of lawsuits filed by technology licensing company WiLAN Inc alleging Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp, and Google LLC infringed its patents on voice assistant technology.

Dell, HP and Microsoft, which together account for 52% of the notebooks and detachable tablets sold in the United States, said the proposed tariffs would increase the cost of laptops in the country.  The move would hurt consumers and the industry, and would not address the Chinese trade practices that the Trump administration\u2019s office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) seeks to remedy, the four companies said in a joint statement posted online.  Implementing the proposed tariffs would increase U.S. prices for laptops and tablets by at least 19%, or around $120 for the average retail price of a laptop, the companies said, citing a recent study by the Consumer Technology Association.  \u201cA price increase of that magnitude may even put laptop devices entirely out of reach for our most cost-conscious consumers,\u201d the companies said, noting that the price hikes would occur during peak holiday and back-to-school seasons.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Microsoft said in the post it was a \u201cstrong supporter\u201d of the California Consumer Privacy Act, known as CCPA, which will go into effect on Jan. 1.  The California law is widely expected to harm profits over the long term for technology companies, retailers, advertising firms and other businesses dependent on collecting consumer data to track users and increase sales.  The law raised fears among companies of a rise in a patchwork of state laws and prompted efforts in Washington to write federal legislation that would pre-empt state efforts.  In September, Reuters was first to report reut.rs\/2X4zhp0 that the federal privacy bill is not likely to come before Congress this year as lawmakers disagreed over several issues.  \u201cUnder CCPA, companies must be transparent about data collection and use, and provide people with the option to prevent their personal information from being sold.

Microsoft products that collect data include its Cortana and Microsoft Edge browsers, Bing web search engine, Windows 10 system, Xbox and Skype.  A source familiar with the matter said it may be easier for Microsoft than other tech platforms to comply with California\u2019s privacy laws because much of Microsoft\u2019s business can qualify as a \u201cservice provider.\u201d CCPA offers special treatment to companies that can classify themselves as \u201cservice providers.\u201d  A service provider is defined as having a written agreement with a business, stating that it will not retain, use, or disclose the personal information of consumers for any purpose other than for a specific purpose set forth in the contract.  Service providers are one of three types of entities generally affected by the CCPA. The others are businesses and third parties.  There are certain advantages to being considered a service provider as opposed to a third party.  For instance, if a business shares personal information with a third party, that can trigger certain disclosures that must be made to the consumer. Such third parties also must provide notice to consumers before selling personal information they receive, which in turn could allow consumers to opt out.  Transferring personal information to a service provider, by contrast, does not necessarily trigger those additional obligations, making it easier to comply with the law.","211":"FILE PHOTO: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addresses a news conference in Berlin, Germany February 27, 2019.

Shares of Microsoft jumped 3 percent, pushing its market capitalization up to $848 billion. With the broad market rebounding following a recent slump, Apple also rose, but less than Microsoft. Its 2.17 percent increase put Apple\u2019s market capitalization at $845 billion, just four months after the iPhone maker breached the $1 trillion mark for the first time.  Microsoft and Apple briefly traded at about the same level after the bell on Monday, but Microsoft\u2019s intraday lead over Apple on Wednesday was more substantial.  Both companies\u2019 market capitalizations were calculated using outstanding shares reported in their most recent 10-Q filings.  Apple\u2019s market capitalization overtook Microsoft\u2019s in 2010 as the Windows seller struggled with slow demand for personal computers, due in part to the explosion of smartphones driven by Apple\u2019s iPhone.  Since then, Microsoft has not ended an official trading session with a stock market value greater than Apple\u2019s.  Shares of several cloud software makers also rose on Wednesday after Salesforce.com Inc\u2019s upbeat quarterly earnings boosted Wall Street\u2019s expectations for the fast-growing sector, which faced pressure in the recent selloff in technology stocks.  Since Satya Nadella took over as chief executive in 2014, Microsoft has reduced its reliance on Windows software for PCs and became a major player in cloud computing, second only to Amazon.com.  In recent months, technology shares have been punished due to investor worries about rising interest rates and fallout from the trade war between the United States and China.  But Apple has suffered more than other Silicon Valley stalwarts, down 19 percent since the iPhone maker warned on Nov. 1 that sales for the crucial holiday quarter would likely miss Wall Street expectations.  Global demand for smartphones has slowed in recent years, making it more difficult for Apple to increase its revenue.

Reliance\u2019s foray into the cloud services market - essentially selling computer services such as website hosting and data storage - could intensify competition in an Indian market dominated by Amazon Web Services (AWS), say analysts.  Ambani disrupted India\u2019s telecoms industry in late 2016 when he launched Jio with free voice and cut-price data plans, pushing some rivals out of business and forcing others to match tariffs and consolidate in a crowded sector that once comprised more than 10 carriers.  \u201cOther cloud players like AWS and Google will have to come up with new, perhaps cheaper pricing models for India,\u201d said Satyajit Sinha, an analyst at tech consultancy Counterpoint.  Ambani has always dubbed Jio a technology company, and used it to launch internet-enabled devices, deliver entertainment services, build fiber broadband and develop other offerings.  The Reliance-Microsoft partnership could help Jio extend its services to India\u2019s booming start-up ecosystem.  On Monday, addressing Reliance shareholders via a recorded video message, Microsoft\u2019s Indian-born Chief Executive Satya Nadella said: \u201cTogether, we will offer comprehensive technology solutions \u2013 from compute and storage, to connectivity and productivity \u2013 to small and medium businesses everywhere in the country.\u201d  PRICE WAR  Jio would provide free connectivity and cloud infrastructure to start-ups, Ambani said, adding the company would offer a \u201cbundle of connectivity, productivity and automation tools\u201d to micro, small and medium business for as little as 1,500 rupees ($21.05) a month.  \u201cThis pricing of elementary services is really the rock bottom price,\u201d said Naveen Mishra, of tech researcher Gartner.  Rivals such as Amazon Web Services and Google offer similar services at multiple times that price, and technology analysts said Ambani\u2019s move could spark a price war in the Indian cloud market, expected to grow at an average 23% annually over the next five years to touch $5.6 billion.  Amazon\u2019s cloud services unit declined to comment on the matter. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  \u201cWe definitely will reassess whether we should keep using AWS or something else, because storage is a huge cost,\u201d said Aprameya Radhakrishna, the founder and CEO of Vokal, an audio-video knowledge-sharing platform similar to Quora.  \u201cIndia is a price conscious nation in general and anything which is competing on price will definitely get attention.\u201d  Reliance\u2019s big push into cloud services also comes as India, one of the world\u2019s fastest growing web services markets, is framing a data privacy law, drafts of which have emphasized storage of key consumer data locally.  The country's central bank has also asked foreign firms such as Mastercard MA.N and Visa V.N to store payments data solely in India.  \"Companies that have a fairly mature IT adoption or those that are playing with a lot of Indian consumer data, they might prefer to move to (Reliance) because this data is guaranteed to be stored locally,\" said Krishna Iyer, an independent technology advisor who was previously a senior executive at cloud services firm Akamai Technologies AKAM.O.","220":"SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Friday rejected any suggestion of bias in a Pentagon decision to award Microsoft Corp an up to $10 billion cloud computing contract, after Amazon.com Inc announced plans to challenge it.

Amazon was considered a favorite for the contract, part of a broader digital modernization process of the Pentagon, before Microsoft emerged as the surprise winner.  In October, Esper removed himself from reviewing the deal due to his son\u2019s employment with one of the original contract applicants, IBM Corp.

Teams users grew from 32 million to 44 million in the period between March 11 and March 18 alone, as many more U.S. companies asked employees to work from home, Microsoft said.  There were no comparable recent numbers for the major rival to Teams, collaboration app Slack Technologies Inc WORK.N, which said in October that it had 12 million daily active users.  Slack did not update that figure during its earnings announcement on March 12, but said four of its five largest deals in the most recent quarter were won against Microsoft Teams. On Thursday, Slack said it added 7,000 new paid customers from Feb. 1 to March 18, a roughly 40% increase over each of its previous two fiscal quarters, when it had added about 5,000 new paid customers per quarter.

Microsoft denies it had any such policy.  The lawsuit, filed in Seattle federal court in 2015, is attracting wider attention after a series of powerful men have left or been fired from their jobs in entertainment, the media and politics for sexual misconduct.  Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys are pushing to proceed as a class action lawsuit, which could cover more than 8,000 women.  More details about Microsoft\u2019s human resources practices were made public on Monday in legal filings submitted as part of that process.  The two sides are exchanging documents ahead of trial, which has not been scheduled.  Out of 118 gender discrimination complaints filed by women at Microsoft, only one was deemed \u201cfounded\u201d by the company, according to the unsealed court filings.  Attorneys for the women described the number of complaints as \u201cshocking\u201d in the court filings, and said the response by Microsoft\u2019s investigations team was \u201clackluster.\u201d  Companies generally keep information about internal discrimination complaints private, making it unclear how the number of complaints at Microsoft compares to those at its competitors.  In a statement on Tuesday, Microsoft said it had a robust system to investigate concerns raised by its employees, and that it wanted them to speak up.  Microsoft budgets more than $55 million a year to promote diversity and inclusion, it said in court filings. The company had about 74,000 U.S. employees at the end of 2017.  Microsoft said the plaintiffs cannot cite one example of a pay or promotion problem in which Microsoft\u2019s investigations team should have found a violation of company policy but did not.  U.S. District Judge James Robart has not yet ruled on the plaintiffs\u2019 request for class action status.  A Reuters review of federal lawsuits filed between 2006 and 2016 revealed hundreds containing sexual harassment allegations where companies used common civil litigation tactics to keep potentially damning information under wraps.  Microsoft had argued that the number of womens\u2019 human resources complaints should be secret because publicizing the outcomes could deter employees from reporting future abuses.  A court-appointed official found that scenario \u201cfar too remote a competitive or business harm\u201d to justify keeping the information sealed.","227":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window.)  * Microsoft gains on upbeat cloud sales forecast  * Lam Research leads gains among chip stocks  * Twitter plunges on weak results  * Futures up: Dow 0.18%, S&P 500 0.20%, Nasdaq 0.58% (Adds details; updates market action)  By Shreyashi Sanyal  Oct 24 (Reuters) - Wall Street was on course to open higher on Thursday, as solid results from Microsoft, Lam Research and Tesla lifted sentiment following lackluster reports from big bellwether companies in the previous session.

A deal would be in line with Microsoft's stance toward China where the firm has a sizeable presence - unlike fellow U.S. tech heavyweights such as Facebook Inc FB.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google which appear to have given up on China's consumer-facing market with its miscellany of government strictures.  The country accounts for over $2 billion in annual revenue, Microsoft President Brad Smith said earlier this year.  WHAT DOES MICROSOFT DO IN CHINA?  Microsoft employs roughly 6,000 people in the country, with offices in Shanghai, Beijing and Suzhou.  Its flagship Windows operating system is widely used, though revenue has long been crimped by piracy. In recent years the firm has pushed its Azure cloud computing product, launched in 2013 via a partnership with local data service company 21Vianet.  China's cyber-security law limits Microsoft to providing Azure's software and services while 21Vianet runs associated data centres. It is a small player in a sector dominated by local providers Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA.N, Baidu Inc BIDU.O, Tencent Holdings Ltd 0700.HK and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.  Microsoft operates both its Bing search engine and LinkedIn social network in China, though again is a small player compared with local giants.

DOES MICROSOFT SELF-CENSOR IN CHINA?  Bing and LinkedIn in China appear similar to their global counterparts but Microsoft censors search results and content the Chinese government considers sensitive.  Upon LinkedIn\u2019s China launch in 2014, two years before the company was bought by Microsoft, then-Chief Executive Jeff Weiner said censoring content would be \u201cnecessary\u201d for the firm to grow in the country.  In 2019, free speech advocates criticised LinkedIn\u2019s position on censorship after human rights activist Zhou Fengsuo said his profile was not viewable in China. LinkedIn blamed an \u201cerror\u201d and restored its visibility.  Software development website GitHub, which Microsoft purchased in 2019, is also accessible from China. The site, a coding repository, has been used by activists in China to preserve internet content before authorities censor the source.  HAS MICROSOFT HAD SCRAPES WITH CHINA\u2019S GOVERNMENT?  Microsoft has bemoaned rampant piracy of Windows in China for decades and has occasionally filed lawsuits and complaints even against state-backed companies to address its concerns.  Its most notable tussle with the government was in 2014 when authorities raided four Microsoft offices demanding access to contracts and other information as part of an anti-trust investigation.  The same year, the government called on all agencies to ban the purchase of Windows 8 citing security reasons.  Microsoft eventually released a \u201cChina Government\u201d edition of Windows 10 following a joint venture formed in 2015 with state-owned China Electronics Technology Corp.  WHAT ABOUT BILL GATES?  Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has spoken in mostly positive terms about China in recent years. In November, he held a public meeting with Peng Liyuan, wife of President Xi Jinping.  Also late last year, Gates criticised the U.S. government\u2019s restrictions on telecommunications equipment maker Huawei and spoke about sharing Windows source code with China\u2019s government which aided official acceptance of the software in the country.  He has praised China\u2019s response to COVID-19, which earned him public thanks from Xi, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has donated $5 million to China for COVID-19 relief.

REUTERS\/Sergio Perez\/File Photo  The contract, called the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, or JEDI, is part of a broad modernization of the Pentagon\u2019s information technology systems.  Here is a timeline of important dates leading up to the award:  JULY 26, 2018: The Pentagon released the final request for proposals from competitors, seeking a single winner to allow for the most rapid adoption of the technology. It said the deal\u2019s initial two-year period would provide time to ensure JEDI was up to standards, noting that new contractors would be needed for other cloud computing demands in the future. The contract, valued at $10 billion over 10 years, was set to be awarded in September.  AUGUST 6, 2018: Oracle Corp ORCL.N filed a protest with the DOD over its plans to award the contract to a single company instead of allowing for multiple winners, arguing that the Pentagon would be locked into a legacy contract for a decade or more. DOD's Government Accountability Office had until November to respond.  OCTOBER 8, 2018: Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google said it was no longer vying for the $10 billion cloud computing contract with the DOD, in part because the company's new ethical guidelines did not align with the project, without elaborating.  OCTOBER 9, 2018: Microsoft said its expanded Azure cloud service to help government clients save data on their own servers would be available by the end of the first quarter of 2019, as it battled Amazon.com for the contract.  NOVEMBER 14, 2018: The Government Accountability Office denied the protest filed by Oracle, finding that the agency \u201creasonably\u201d determined that the single-award approach was in the government\u2019s best interests for reasons including national security concerns and complied with applicable law.  APRIL 26, 2019: Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp were selected to continue competing for Pentagon cloud-computing services as part of a contract that could be worth some $10 billion.  The selection left Oracle and IBM Corp IBM.N out of the competition for the contract, which is part of a broad modernization of Pentagon information technology systems.  JULY 18, 2019: U.S. President Donald Trump said his administration was looking closely at Amazon.com\u2019s bid on a $10 billion cloud contract with the DOD after getting complaints from other technology companies.  JULY 19, 2019: Four Republican members of U.S. Congress, including House Armed Services Committee ranking member Mac Thornberry, sent a letter to Trump urging him to move forward with a $10 billion cloud contract with the DOD.  AUGUST 1, 2019: The Pentagon decided to put on hold its decision to award the $10 billion cloud-computing contract after Trump said his administration was examining Amazon.com Inc\u2019s bid following complaints from other technology companies.  AUGUST 5, 2019: Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Jack Reed asked U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper if \u201coutside\u201d influence caused him to delay awarding a $10 billion cloud-computing contract, after Trump suggested Amazon.com Inc should not win it.  OCTOBER 22, 2019: U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper removed himself from reviewing a disputed $10 billion cloud-computing contract because of a possible conflict of interest.","242":"(Corrects first paragraph to show Softbank is Japanese company, not Chinese)  SAO PAULO, June 6 (Reuters) - Brazilian logistics company Loggi has raised $150 million in a new financing round led by Japan\u2019s Softbank, Microsoft Corp, GGV, Fifth Wall and Velt Partners, it said in a statement on Thursday.

The announcement was made at Google\u2019s cloud unit\u2019s annual customer and partner conference, which has been turned into a virtual gathering over several weeks due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.  Google has been trying for more than a decade to catch up with Microsoft Corp\u2019s Office, which dominates the global market for corporate email and document editing tools. Both companies have been adding new video-calling features and other collaboration tools to attract new business from companies operating from home during the pandemic.

REUTERS\/Jonathan Ernst\/File Photo  The development marks a shift in how Congress is adapting to the internet, especially in the middle of a pandemic. Use of the app, called Markup ERVS, had not been publicly disclosed before Friday. (ERVS stands for \u201cElectronic Remote Voting System.\u201d)  A total of 230 Democrats in the House of Representatives logged into Markup on their government-provided iPhones to cast 11 votes over several days for a variety of contested leadership positions, including the assistant speaker, the chairs of major committees and the leadership of the House campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said Markup spokesperson Colby Redmond.  The House Democrats also chose their caucus chair through the app, which transfers data to staff in Washington.  Earlier this year, the House changed its procedures for voting on legislation by the full chamber. It allowed members, for the first time, to communicate their votes to colleagues in Washington, who then cast those votes for them in person.  So far, only Democrats have adopted the Markup technology. Republicans have expressed concerns about virtual voting, saying it sets a bad precedent.  U.S. Representative Hakeem Jeffries, who leads the House Democratic Caucus, said in a statement that the Markup app allowed Democrats \u201cto safely recreate the traditions of the House Democratic Caucus\u2019 organizational meetings, including Members\u2019 ability to vote by secret ballot.\u201d  The use of Markup for party leadership races illustrates an early but limited scenario, where a small number of devices and ballots decided the result within a closed system, said Redmond.  The House\u2019s Information Resources office reviewed the software\u2019s security and then installed it on lawmakers\u2019 phones ahead of the contests, a House Information Resources spokesperson confirmed.  Markup\u2019s development was accelerated in March by the advent of the coronavirus. The virus continues to affect lawmakers\u2019 ability to travel to Washington to cast votes and meet with colleagues, making the app\u2019s launch timely.  While the concept of internet-based mobile phone voting has been discussed in the civic technology industry for several years, cybersecurity experts have generally warned against its widespread deployment due to the possibility of cyberattacks.  As a sign of the app\u2019s security, Redmond said, Markup ERVS, a product of Washington-based government tech startup Markup LLC, was built in partnership with Microsoft Corp.  Markup borrows code from Microsoft\u2019s ElectionGuard technology, said Redmond. That offers \u201ca way of checking election results are accurate, and that votes have not been altered,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s website says.  The votes themselves are also encrypted in transit, Redmond said.  \u201cThis was a great example of how ElectionGuard can be used in innovative ways to ensure a secure and verifiable voting process,\u201d Microsoft Vice President Tom Burt wrote in a blog post published Friday.","246":"OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp\u2019s potential acquisition of short-video app TikTok carries myriad risks, thrusting it into the politically fraught social media business and Sino-U.S. conflict amid increased scrutiny of big-tech companies.  FILE PHOTO: The Microsoft sign is shown on top of the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles, California, U.S., Oct. 19,2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  But the deal could help Microsoft build on its $27 billion purchase of LinkedIn to become a bigger player in internet advertising now dominated by Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google.  Microsoft on Sunday said it aims to complete a deal by Sept. 15 for TikTok\u2019s U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand operations. It is likely to have an edge in pricing negotiations as the U.S. is effectively forcing TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent, ByteDance, to sell by threatening to ban the app as a security risk.  TikTok has taken teenagers around the world by storm and emerged as a significant competitor to Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube. But like rivals, TikTok faces substantial new costs for content moderation as the spread of misinformation and allegations of political bias roil social media.  Increased oversight costs accounted for much of the 10-percentage-point drop in gross profit margins for Facebook and Alphabet over the last 3-1\/2 years, Refinitiv data showed.  \u201cDoes Microsoft really want to own an app that breeds conspiracy theories in tweens?\u201d said Hank Green, YouTube star and chief executive of educational media company Complexly. He said TikTok removes content to maintain \u201ca certain feel\u201d, and could face public challenges over such decisions more often under a bigger name such as Microsoft.  At $1.55 trillion, Microsoft is the world\u2019s second-largest company by market capitalization after Apple Inc but has in recent years faced less criticism than peers over antitrust, data protection and China projects.  NADELLA\u2019S DEALS  Microsoft has done several big deals since Satya Nadella became chief executive in 2014, with acquisitions including world-building game Minecraft and job-search social network LinkedIn. They have fared better than those under predecessor Steve Ballmer, whose failed deals included Nokia Oyj\u2019s phone business.  The LinkedIn acquisition in 2016, for 50% above its share price, was Nadella\u2019s biggest and riskiest. Microsoft shares fell 3% when it was announced with analysts expressing concern about slowing revenue growth and an expected cap on usage.  Some concerns may have been overblown. Microsoft has avoided antitrust and privacy scrutiny with a cautious approach to connecting LinkedIn to other products, such as Outlook, and analysts have largely viewed the deal as a success in terms of synergies.  Though the COVID-19 pandemic has slowed sales, LinkedIn ad revenue was among Microsoft\u2019s fastest-growing over 2017-2019 as the global economy roared.  Overall, LinkedIn has generated $14.3 billion in revenue for Microsoft through ads and subscriptions, though analysts estimate it remains unprofitable.  TikTok is a bigger gamble because it caters to a less-affluent audience than LinkedIn, where advertisers typically pay more to attract wealthier consumers. TikTok\u2019s ad sales team and technology also are far less mature than LinkedIn\u2019s were, and TikTok faces greater competition.  About 11% of U.S. adults use TikTok at least once per week, versus 49% for YouTube and 62% for Facebook, showed a survey last month by tech consultancy Vorhaus Advisors.  LinkedIn came to Microsoft at 13 years old with 11,000 employees and 105 million monthly users globally. Six-year-old TikTok, by contrast, has about 1,000 U.S. employees and has been downloaded 226 million times in the four countries targeted by Microsoft\u2019s deal, showed data from app tracker Sensor Tower.  LinkedIn \u201cwas bought on domination of a sector, good revenue, and good margins,\u201d said Mike Vorhaus, head of Vorhaus Advisors. \u201cTikTok is going to be valued based on its incredible user growth and mobile advertising revenue opportunities.\u201d  TikTok would make Microsoft relevant among both young engineers looking for a hip place to work and advertisers clamoring for alternatives to Facebook and Google.  Green, the YouTube star, said he doubted Microsoft ownership would hurt TikTok, noting he amassed 600,000 TikTok followers since he began posting a month ago.  \u201cI don\u2019t see anything at all standing in the way,\u201d he said.","247":"* Ex-Japan Asia down 0.2%, slim gains seen in Japan, Korea, Taiwan  * Investors expect Fed to keep dovish stance  * Microsoft shares up 3.7% after strong earnings  * U.S. tech earnings big focus  * European shares seen falling about 0.4%  TOKYO\/NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Asian equities slipped on Wednesday as investors looked to the Federal Reserve\u2019s guidance on its monetary policy while futures for U.S. tech shares jumped after strong earnings from Microsoft.

I expect shares to get stuck in a range for a while,\u201d said Hisashi Iwama, senior portfolio manager at Asset Management One.  But the tech sector remained a bright spot after Microsoft\u2019s earnings lifted Nasdaq futures 0.5% while Japan\u2019s Nikkei also rose 0.3%.  Microsoft shares rose 3.7% in extended trading after its Azure cloud computing services grew 50%, boosting optimism for other U.S. tech giants, including Apple and Facebook , which announce quarterly results later in the day.  \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s earnings were superb, even compared with strong market expectations,\u201d said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.  \u201cThose tech firm shares have been in a bit of the doldrums since August but they are likely to lead the market again, given their solid outlook,\u201d he said.  At their peak in August, the combined market capitalisation of the top five biggest U.S. tech companies, which also include Amazon and Alphabet, reached 24.6% of the U.S. blue chip S&P500 index. It stood at 22.7%, still well above 15% two years ago.  S&P500 futures were mostly flat, capped by caution ahead of the Fed\u2019s policy meeting as well as profit-taking on cyclical shares after stellar gains this month.  The S&P500 is now trading at 22.7 times its expected earnings, near its September peak of 23.1 times, which was its most inflated level since the dotcom bubble in 2000.  A surge in shares of video games company Gamestop driven by retail investors also raised some concerns that a rally propelled by loads of stimulus money from governments and central banks has become extreme.  Still, analysts expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to stick to its dovish tone to help speed the economic recovery when it concludes its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.  U.S. stimulus talks are also in focus with U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer saying Democrats will move forward on President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan without Republican support if necessary.  Benchmark 10-year notes were yielding 1.035%, having hit a three-week low of 1.028% on Tuesday on rising speculation Biden may have to scale back and possibly delay his ambitious stimulus plan.  The U.S. dollar was little moved as investors awaited the Fed\u2019s decision for clues on whether they should buy riskier currencies.  The dollar index flirted with this week\u2019s low at 90.204, while the euro held firm at $1.2161.  Sterling rose to as high as $1.3753, a level last seen in May 2018 while the Japanese yen changed hands at 103.70 per dollar.  The Australian dollar slipped 0.1% to $0.7739, showing muted response to stronger-than-expected local inflation data.  Oil prices were supported by economic optimism, with U.S. crude futures trading up 0.6% at $52.95 per barrel.  The International Monetary Fund raised its forecast for global growth in 2021, as widely expected, and many investors expect the global economic recovery from the pandemic-driven downturn to continue.","248":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O on Thursday said it is contesting the Pentagon's award of an up to $10 billion cloud computing deal to Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, expressing concern that politics got in the way of a fair contracting process.  The company filed notice last Friday that it will formally protest the decision on the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, known as JEDI. In a company-wide meeting on Thursday, Amazon Web Services\u2019 CEO Andy Jassy said it would be challenging for a U.S. agency to award a contract objectively when the president is disparaging one of the contestants, according to an Amazon spokesman.  President Donald Trump has long criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos.

A challenge to the Defense Department\u2019s award announced last month was widely expected by legal experts, analysts and consultants, especially after Trump publicly derided Amazon\u2019s bid for the high-stakes contract.  Trump had said in August that Amazon\u2019s bid for the JEDI contract was under review by his administration after complaints from other companies.

Picture taken November 7, 2019. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters Breakingviews) - Microsoft may finally get its social-media breakthrough. The least cool technology giant is in talks to buy parts of TikTok, the wildly popular Chinese-owned video app. Owning it could finally bring buzz and more advertising dollars. But there are political risks, and buying only a portion of the ByteDance unit may be messy.  The maker of Office software has outperformed most of its tech rivals in recent years to reach a $1.6 trillion value. But with its emphasis on business customers, it\u2019s still an odd suitor for TikTok. The involvement of President Donald Trump in the process adds a surreal overlay. Trump has threatened to shut down the app. He said on Monday he wouldn\u2019t mind if Microsoft acquired it, but added that the U.S. government should get a cut of any deal.  Chief Executive Satya Nadella may see a chance to reach a broader audience at last. While Microsoft has the LinkedIn professional network, it lacks a mainstream social-media platform and efforts to reach consumers, like streaming service Mixer, have flopped. Acquiring parts of TikTok could fill in some gaps. Microsoft\u2019s search advertising revenue, which fell by nearly 20% year-on-year in the quarter to June 30, was already mediocre before the pandemic.  TikTok also complements Xbox, a rare consumer success for Microsoft, which reported an almost 65% year-on-year jump in gaming revenue in the last quarter. The app known for viral videos has 100 million users in the United States. That could boost Microsoft\u2019s tiny share of the U.S. display ad market, which Facebook dominates.  There are political landmines beyond the public quasi-negotiation with Trump. Owning TikTok would raise concerns about privacy and inflammatory content. It could also draw attention to censorship in China by LinkedIn.  And it\u2019s unclear how TikTok would be divided up. A deal envisions Microsoft owning the app only in the United States and a few other countries. It would still need ByteDance technology but U.S. authorities want a clean break, including in software.  Other TikTok suitors could emerge, but Trump\u2019s meddling is discouraging. If Microsoft can get through the unusually public dealmaking process, the potential financial gains may be worth its time in the spotlight.","251":"(Updates to add Chinese state media comment)  NEW YORK\/WASHINGTON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has agreed to give China\u2019s ByteDance 45 days to negotiate a sale of popular short-video app TikTok to Microsoft Corp , three people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.  U.S. officials have said TikTok under its Chinese parent poses a national risk because of the personal data it handles. Trump said on Friday he was planning to ban TikTok in the United States after dismissing the idea of a sale to Microsoft.  But following a discussion between Trump and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, the Redwood, Washington-based company said in a statement on Sunday that it would continue negotiations to acquire TikTok from ByteDance, and that it aimed to reach a deal by Sept. 15.  Trump changed his mind following pressure from some of his advisers and many in his Republican party, one of the sources said. Banning TikTok would alienate many of its young users ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November, and would likely trigger a wave of legal challenges. Several prominent Republican lawmakers put out statements in the last two days urging Trump to back a sale of TikTok to Microsoft.  \u201cA win-win in the making,\u201d Republican Senator Lindsey Graham tweeted in response to Trump\u2019s new stance on Sunday.  The negotiations between ByteDance and Microsoft will be overseen by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a U.S. government panel that has the right to block any agreement, according to the sources, who requested anonymity ahead of a White House announcement. Microsoft cautioned in its statement that there is no certainty a deal will be reached.  \u201cMicrosoft fully appreciates the importance of addressing the President\u2019s concerns. It is committed to acquiring TikTok subject to a complete security review and providing proper economic benefits to the United States, including the United States Treasury,\u201d Microsoft said in a statement.  ByteDance and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Microsoft talks. In a statement issued late on Sunday that did not mention TikTok, ByteDance said it faced \u201ccomplex and unimaginable difficulties\u201d in going global.  As relations between the United States and China deteriorate over trade, Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, cyber security and the spread of the novel coronavirus, TikTok has emerged as a flashpoint in the dispute between the world\u2019s two largest economies.  State-backed newspaper China Daily on Monday called ByteDance the victim of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d from the United States, and said Washington had not provided evidence to support its allegation that TikTok posed a threat to U.S. national security.  Microsoft, which also owns professional social media network LinkedIn, would become a major competitor to social media giants such as Facebook and Snap Inc were its bid for TikTok, which boasts 100 millions U.S. users, to succeed.  Under the proposed deal, Microsoft said it would take over TikTok\u2019s operations in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It said it would ensure that all private data of TikTok\u2019s American users is transferred to and remains in the United States.  Microsoft may invite other American investors to acquire minority stakes in TikTok, the company added. About 70% of the outside capital ByteDance has raised has come from the United States.  It is not clear how much Microsoft could pay for TikTok. Reuters reported last week that ByteDance\u2019s valuation expectations for the app exceeded $50 billion, although U.S. pressure to divest it could lower that price tag.  A key issue in the negotiations will be separating TikTok\u2019s technology from ByteDance\u2019s infrastructure and access, to alleviate U.S. concerns about the integrity of personal data. ByteDance owns a Chinese short video app called Douyin that was based on the same code used for TikTok.  One idea under consideration is to give Microsoft and ByteDance a transition period to develop technology for TikTok that will be completely separate from ByteDance, one of the sources said.  APP SCRUTINY  The United States has been increasingly scrutinizing app developers over the personal data they handle, especially if some of it involves U.S. military or intelligence personnel. Ordering the divestment of TikTok would not be the first time the White House has taken action over such concerns.  Earlier this year, Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd sold Grindr LLC, a popular gay dating app it bought in 2016, for $620 million after being ordered by CFIUS to divest.  In 2018, CFIUS forced China\u2019s Ant Financial to scrap plans to buy MoneyGram International Inc over concerns about the safety of data that could identify U.S. citizens.  ByteDance was valued at as much as $140 billion earlier this year when one of its shareholders, Cheetah Mobile, sold a small stake in a private deal, Reuters has reported. The start-up\u2019s investors include Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp .","252":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon's inspector general on Wednesday said it could not determine whether the White House influenced the award of a $10 billion contract to Microsoft Corp MSFT.O over Amazon AMZN.O after several officials said their conversations were privileged \"presidential communications.\"  Known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, the cloud computing contract is intended to give the military better access to data and technology from remote locations.  \u201cWe could not definitively determine the full extent or nature of interactions that administration officials had, or may have had, with senior DoD officials regarding the JEDI Cloud procurement because of the assertion of a \u2018presidential communications privilege,\u2019\u201d the report said, referring to the Department of Defense by its acronym.  Amazon, originally considered to be the favorite to win the award, has blamed President Donald Trump for bias against the company and for improperly pressuring the Pentagon.  The report said \u201cwe could not be certain whether there were any White House communications with some DoD officials which may have affected the JEDI procurement,\u201d adding investigators did not find any evidence of a DoD official acting for the White House to influence the process.  The report leaves open the question of whether Trump improperly influenced one of the most closely watched procurement contracts given its size and the high-profile nature of the bidders.  The Defense Department said the report \u201cshould finally close the door on the media and corporate-driven attacks on the career procurement officials\u201d involved with JEDI.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  However, Democrat Jack Reed, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the report \u201ctroubling and incomplete\u201d and said, \u201cit offers yet another example of the president\u2019s efforts to inappropriately pressure federal agencies.\u201d  A spokesman for Amazon Web Services said the \u201cWhite House\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the IG\u2019s investigation is yet another blatant attempt to avoid a meaningful and transparent review of the JEDI contract award.\u201d  The company added \u201cit\u2019s clear that this report couldn\u2019t assess political interference because several DoD witnesses were instructed by the White House not to answer the IG\u2019s questions about communications between the White House and DoD officials.\u201d  In a blog post on Wednesday, a Microsoft official said Amazon\u2019s pricing was key to its defeat, in contrast to the government bias Amazon is claiming.  \u201cNow it wants a re-do,\u201d said Jon Palmer, deputy general counsel at Microsoft. \u201cThat\u2019s not good for our war-fighters. That\u2019s not good for confidence in public procurement. That\u2019s not good for anybody but Amazon.\u201d  The White House did not respond to requests for comment.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Amazon filed a lawsuit in November, weeks after the contract was awarded to Microsoft. Amazon has said the Defense Department\u2019s decision to give the contract to Microsoft was full of \u201cegregious errors,\u201d which were a result of \u201cimproper pressure from President Donald Trump.\u201d  Trump, who has publicly derided Amazon head Jeff Bezos and repeatedly criticized the giant online retailer, has accused the Washington Post, owned by Bezos, of unfair coverage.  Defense Secretary Mark Esper has rejected that there was bias and said the Pentagon made its choice fairly and freely without external influence.  In the inspector general\u2019s report, former Defense Secretary James Mattis was specifically asked about an excerpt from his former staff member\u2019s book that said the president told Mattis to \u201cscrew Amazon\u201d out of a chance to bid on the JEDI cloud contract.

Microsoft won a contract in November to supply the Army with at least 2,500 prototypes of augmented reality headsets, which digitally displays contextual information in front of a user\u2019s eyes. The government has said the devices would be used on the battlefield and in training to improve soldiers \u201clethality, mobility and situational awareness.\u201d  In a petition to Microsoft executives, posted on Twitter, workers said they \u201cdid not sign up to develop weapons, and we demand a say in how our work is used.\u201d They called on the company to develop \u201ca public-facing acceptable use policy\u201d for its technology and an external review board to publicly enforce it.  Microsoft and the U.S. Army did not immediately respond to requests to comment.

Though many governments want to better draw upon the expertise of the biggest U.S. tech companies, fresh employee resistance has added a new challenge to already complicated relationships.  Worker pushback led Alphabet Inc last year to announce it would not renew a Pentagon contract in which its artificial intelligence technology is used to analyze drone imagery.  In other cases, employee criticism has invited greater public scrutiny to deals, such as $10 billion cloud computing contract yet to be awarded and various contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

REUTERS\/Brian Snyder\/File Photo  So when Thyssenkrupp North America needed help predicting when to service its lifts, it turned to Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, a partnership that illustrates how Microsoft's chief executive, Satya Nadella, has leveraged the cloud to grow its own business.  A 2014 meeting between the leadership of the North American operations of Germany's Thyssenkrupp AG TKAG.DE and newly installed Microsoft CEO Nadella led to MAX, a predictive maintenance service built on Azure, Microsoft's cloud-computing platform, which has since been used to connect the elevators of 41,000 Thyssenkrupp customers to the cloud.  Before that meeting, the company\u2019s relationship with Microsoft consisted largely of renewing its license for Windows software. Since then, Thyssenkrupp North America\u2019s spending with Microsoft has more than doubled, CEO Patrick Bass told Reuters. \u201cOur IT spend as a whole total is going down, and yet our capabilities and our total spend with Microsoft have substantially increased.\u201d  Leveraging the cloud to enlarge its relationship with customers like Thyssenkrupp has been a key to Nadella\u2019s strategy, and it has paid off: Microsoft shares are up 180 percent since Nadella took over, and its market cap edged above $800 billion for the first time earlier this month.  When it reports earnings on Thursday, the tech giant is once again expected to post banner results, fueled by its fast-growing Office 365 productivity suite subscription service and the Azure cloud computing business.  Its work with Thyssenkrupp illustrates the success Microsoft has had in moving from its traditional licensing model to an emphasis on partnerships and subscription-based cloud-computing products and services.  Bass said Thyssenkrupp has flagged 26 digitization projects, and today every single one \u201chas some touch point into the tech platforms of Microsoft.\u201d  Thyssenkrupp has \u201cgone from being a producer of things and a servicer of things to selling things as a service,\u201d said Sam George, Microsoft director of Azure IoT engineering. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone through quite a transformation.\u201d  George said he has accompanied Nadella on several customer visits. Microsoft has entered similar partnerships with companies including Kroger Co KR.N, Starbucks Corp SBUX.O , Chevron Corp CVX.N and Adobe Systems Inc ADBE.O. The company said 75 percent of Fortune 500 companies have at least three Microsoft cloud enterprise services, up from 70 percent having at least two in 2015.  Since changing the way it reports revenue in late 2015 to emphasize cloud services, Microsoft has seen its Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Office 365, go from declining 3 percent year-over-year in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 to 28 percent growth in the first quarter of 2018. Growth in the company\u2019s Intelligent Cloud, which includes Azure, has gone from 8 percent in the 2016 first quarter to 14 percent in the same period this year  Most recently, Thyssenkrupp North America has been rolling out the Office 365 productivity suite across all of its businesses while encouraging employees to use Microsoft\u2019s Teams collaboration software. It is also using Dynamics 365 as its customer relationship management software of choice.  Bass said his company no longer uses private data centers and is on a path to eliminate on-premise computer servers. Already, 50 percent of Thyssenkrupp North America\u2019s compute and storage is deployed on Azure, and that is expected to grow to more than two thirds within the next 12 months.  Among recent projects he\u2019s proud of, Bass highlighted the use of HoloLens, Microsoft\u2019s augmented reality glasses and associated Azure software, in Thyssenkrupp\u2019s stair lift business. HoloLens lets Thyssenkrupp show customers what a stair chair could look like when installed at home, reducing delivery waits from 12 weeks to less than three weeks, Bass said.  \u201cWe are going to leverage the services of the Azure cloud platform to its fullest,\u201d Bass said.","263":"TAIPEI, March 12 (Reuters) - Foxconn does not expect to suffer any loss as a result of a lawsuit filed by Microsoft Corp, the chief executive of the Taiwanese company, Terry Gou, said on Tuesday.

Here\u2019s the background. Last spring, U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly of Brooklyn ruled that Microsoft was barred from telling one of its cloud computing customers \u2013 a multinational conglomerate \u2013 about a government warrant for the emails of two employees whom federal prosecutors in Brooklyn said were allegedly part of an international conspiracy to send goods to a foreign country that\u2019s under U.S. sanctions for terrorism.  Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.  The government did not want the corporation to know about the warrant and obtained a non-disclosure order under the Stored Communications Act, arguing that its investigation would be jeopardized if anyone at the company knew prosecutors had access to the two employees\u2019 accounts. Microsoft \u2013 which, you may recall, has a long (and successful!) history of pushing back against government demands for secrecy over warrants for customers\u2019 information \u2013 suggested limited disclosure. Perhaps, Microsoft suggested, it could tell a U.S.-based lawyer, officer or director at the company about the warrant. At a minimum, Microsoft said, it should be permitted to inform someone from the company of the warrant\u2019s existence.  Judge Donnelly ruled that Microsoft can\u2019t say a word to its cloud computing customer. She agreed with Microsoft that its First Amendment rights are at issue, and even that the government\u2019s prohibition is subject to the highest standard of review, strict scrutiny. But the judge held that the gag order met that high standard. Based on ex parte evidence from prosecutors, she said there was a risk that other people at Microsoft\u2019s client company might be involved in the alleged conspiracy.  Microsoft and its lawyers at Davis Wright Tremaine and Covington & Burling appealed to the 2nd Circuit, arguing that its customers own the data they store in the Microsoft internet cloud, just as they did when employee emails were stored in customers\u2019 own hard drives and proprietary servers. Even in those days, the government had to tell companies when it obtained warrants for their records, Microsoft said. Targeted businesses could protect their rights, by, for instance, asserting attorney client privilege. But now, Microsoft said, prosecutors want to be able to obtain all kinds of corporate records from Microsoft and other cloud service providers without companies even knowing their records are in the government\u2019s hands.  I suspect it will not surprise you to hear that trade groups representing U.S. businesses and a group of former prosecutors who now specialize in defending U.S. corporations agree with Microsoft. In amicus briefs docketed this week at the 2nd Circuit, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Internet Association and other trade groups as well as 36 former New York federal prosecutors argued that new technology should not allow the government to sidestep old constitutional principles. (Amicus briefs backing Microsoft first turned up in the docket in late December and early January, as my Reuters colleague Sara Merken reported in a story about other cloud services companies appearing as Microsoft amici. But the redocketing of the Chamber and ex-prosecutors\u2019 briefs brought them to my attention.)  The business lobby\u2019s argument is twofold: U.S. companies that offer cloud computing services will be less competitive than foreign counterparts with prospective customers worried about prosecutors secretly grabbing their cloud-stored data; and U.S. companies may be less willing to take advantage of the efficiencies of cloud storage if they don\u2019t want to expose their data to secret government warrants. So, as the brief explains, Microsoft\u2019s appeal raises Fourth Amendment concerns for cloud storage customers who can\u2019t defend against searches they don\u2019t even know about and First Amendment issues for cloud service providers who can\u2019t tell their customers that a warrant has been served.  \u201cIf moving information from a desktop computer or private server to the cloud results in reduced legal protection from government demands, then individuals and businesses naturally will be more reluctant to use this new technology,\u201d the brief said. \u201cThese consequences make it critically important that courts strictly enforce legal limitations on the government\u2019s ability to obtain data held in the cloud without the knowledge of the information\u2019s owner.\u201d  Three dozen former prosecutors \u2013 from longtime white collar defense lawyers such as Charles Stillman and Andrew Levander to lawyers who only recently left the government, such as Rachel Maimin and Brendan Quigley \u2013 emphasized that the criminal investigation underlying the Microsoft appeal has been underway since at least 2018 with no notice to Microsoft\u2019s customer \u2013 not even, as Microsoft proposed, to a high-level, U.S.-based corporate official. Even acknowledging the government\u2019s right to conduct secret surveillance, the former prosecutors said, the long-running gag order in this case is worrisome.  In typical corporate investigations, they said, targeted companies have an opportunity to contest government demands for information or to challenge information obtained in secret surveillance. Those same constitutional safeguards, they said, \u201cshould equally apply to searches of information maintained in the cloud.\u201d  The Brooklyn U.S. Attorney\u2019s office declined to comment on the amicus briefs or on Microsoft\u2019s contention that it must be permitted to tell its customer about the warrant. The government\u2019s reply brief is due on March 15.","267":"March 13 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates has stepped down from the company\u2019s board to dedicate more time to his philanthropic priorities including global health, education and tackling climate change, the company said on Friday.

The Redmond, Washington-based software company is the fourth largest contributor to Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden\u2019s candidate campaign committee, according to data from OpenSecrets, a website which tracks money in politics and campaign finance records.  The company\u2019s President Brad Smith is playing a key role behind the scenes, hosting a fundraiser for Biden last year in Medina, Washington. He is also a big dollar bundler - people who help raise more than $25,000 for the Biden campaign - and had a public role during the Democratic National Convention, similar to Amazon.com Inc policy chief Jay Carney.  Microsoft Chief Technology Officer Kevin Scott and his wife have contributed over $50,000 supporting committees helping Biden win, according to campaign finance records. And Microsoft board member and co-founder of LinkedIn, Reid Hoffman, and his wife have also donated generously to the Biden campaign. Hoffman\u2019s wife has contributed over half a million dollars to the Biden victory fund.  Microsoft senior executives also have donated more to the Biden campaign during the primaries than any other large tech company, according to data from the Revolving Door Project, part of Center for Economic & Policy Research (CERP).  \u201cMicrosoft has been playing politics for much longer than the other large technology companies that are widely talked about,\u201d said Max Moran, a researcher at CERP, noting it has been around longer than most U.S. tech companies.  \u201cIt knows how to play the game on both sides of the aisle,\u201d he added.  Companies are prohibited by law from donating themselves. The contributions, according to OpenSecrets, were either made by the company\u2019s political action committees (PACs) themselves, members of the PAC or their employees.  Microsoft spokeswoman said the company has a history of engaging with administrations on issues that matter to its business. \u201cOur approach has been consistent: we\u2019ll partner where we can, we\u2019ll stand apart where we should,\u201d she said, adding that the contributions were made by its employees, without offering more details.  Large technology companies including Microsoft have not emerged in the top 20 contributors list for the Trump candidate campaign committee. However, Microsoft\u2019s Smith, whose donations have mostly helped Democrats, has made several contributions to Republicans, including a $15,000 donation to the National Republican Congressional Committee, according to campaign finance records.  The Trump campaign\u2019s top contributors include government employees from the U.S. Postal Service and the Department of Defense, followed by companies such as American Airlines Group and banks such as Wells Fargo, according to OpenSecrets.  The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.  Biden campaign spokesman Matt Hill did not comment on the story, but he pointed to an earlier statement shared with Reuters, which said: \u201cMany technology giants and their executives have not only abused their power, but misled the American people, damaged our democracy, and evaded any form of responsibility. That ends with a President Biden.\u201d  Microsoft has escaped escalating criticism from Washington lawmakers and probes by regulatory agencies - which has culminated into one of the largest antitrust lawsuits against Alphabet\u2019s Google by the Justice Department.  In fact, the lawsuit has delivered a potential opportunity for Microsoft to increase usage of its Bing search engine, a win years after it abandoned a long campaign for legal relief.  The company\u2019s other large competitors, such as Facebook Inc , Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc, are also grappling with various state and federal investigations.  Earlier this year, Microsoft also won a highly controversial $10 billion cloud computing contract from the U.S. Department of Defense after it defeated Amazon in a contest marred by allegations of political influence by President Donald Trump.  \u2018ADULT IN THE ROOM\u2019  Microsoft has presented itself as an \u201cadult in the room\u201d to both parties on the topic of antitrust, a strategy that will continue to ensure attention is diverted to its rivals, CERP\u2019s Moran said.  Smith and Microsoft, for example, have invested time and resources in staying in the good graces of Democratic lawmakers.  Earlier this year, Smith met with the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, which produced a scathing report on how Big Tech hurts competitors. During the meeting, Smith offered Microsoft\u2019s perspective as a company that has faced antitrust regulation in the past and also discussed his company\u2019s concerns about the way Apple operates its App Store, according to a source familiar with the matter.  Lawyers and antitrust experts said there are some challenges Microsoft still faces, even though they are not likely to result in any meaningful action in the immediate future under a Biden administration. For example, in February the Federal Trade Commission said it will examine prior acquisitions from Big Tech companies including Microsoft. The company also faces an antitrust complaint in Europe from Slack, which operates a product similar to Microsoft Teams.  \u201cIt\u2019s the classic case of shiny objects,\u201d said Andrew Gavil, a professor at Howard University School of Law. \u201cMicrosoft has succeeded in making sure the attention stays on everybody else even when they continue to be dominant in many areas they operate.\u201d","269":"Oct 8 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Thursday said it would adopt a set of 10 principles for running its app store for Windows devices that could lower the commissions it charges, aligning itself with practices promoted by a group of Apple Inc critics.  Microsoft and scores of other companies have criticized the iPhone maker\u2019s app store practices, which require developers to use Apple\u2019s official store to reach its hundreds of millions of users and to pay commissions of up to 30% for purchases made in Apple\u2019s store.  Last month, a number of those critics including Spotify Technology SA and Match Group Inc formed a group called the Coalition for App Fairness to challenge Apple\u2019s practices. The group laid out 10 principles - including barring \u201cunfair, unreasonable or discriminatory fees or revenue shares\u201d - that it urged all app stores to follow.  Microsoft runs an app store for PCs, laptops and tablets that use Windows 10 called the Microsoft Store. In a blog post Thursday, Microsoft said it would adopt 10 principles that closely mirrored the group\u2019s demands but did not formally join the group.  Some of the principles will have no immediate effect other than codifying existing Microsoft practices. For example, Microsoft already allows third-party app stores and downloads from the internet on Windows devices.  But other principles - such as a commitment to \u201ccharge reasonable fees that reflect the competition we face from other app stores on Windows\u201d - could mean changes to Microsoft\u2019s commissions of between 15% and 30% of store purchases. Microsoft said it might revise the principles in the future.  In a statement, Spotify said that Microsoft\u2019s new position \u201cwill help create a level playing field for developers both large and small, provide consumers with greater choice, and hopefully encourage other platforms to do the same.\u201d (Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; editing by Richard Pullin)","270":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday dropped Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O privacy fight with the Justice Department over whether prosecutors can force technology companies to hand over data stored overseas after Congress passed legislation that resolved the dispute.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The justices heard arguments in the high-profile case on Feb. 27, but President Donald Trump on March 22 signed legislation into law that makes clear that U.S. judges can issue warrants for such data while giving companies an avenue to object if the request conflicts with foreign law.  \u201cNo live dispute remains between the parties over the issue,\u201d the court said in an unsigned opinion, declaring the case moot.  Microsoft and the Justice Department had been locked in a dispute over how U.S. prosecutors seek access to data held on overseas computer servers owned by U.S. companies. The case involved Microsoft\u2019s challenge to a domestic warrant issued by a U.S. judge for emails stored on a Microsoft server in Dublin relating to a drug-trafficking investigation.  The bipartisan new law, known as the Cloud Act, was supported by Microsoft, other major technology companies and the Trump administration but opposed by civil liberties groups that said it lacked sufficient privacy protections.  \u201cWe welcome the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling ending our case in light of the Cloud Act being signed into to law. Our goal has always been a new law and international agreements with strong privacy protections that govern how law enforcement gathers digital evidence across borders,\u201d said Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president.  A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.  Microsoft, which has 100 data centers in 40 countries, was the first American company to challenge a domestic search warrant seeking data held outside the United States. The Microsoft customer whose emails were sought told the company he was based in Ireland when he signed up for his account.  During arguments in the case, which had been one of the most closely watched of the court\u2019s current term, some justices urged Congress to pass a law to resolve the matter. Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican led the efforts to pass the new law, attended the arguments.  The Trump administration had appealed a 2016 ruling by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2016 that found that the emails in the Microsoft case were beyond the reach of domestic search warrants obtained under a federal law called the 1986 Stored Communications Act.","271":"FILE PHOTO: The Microsoft logo is pictured ahead of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 24, 2019.

The services are designed to work for titles played on any device - including those with operating systems from Microsoft\u2019s onetime rivals like Apple and Google.  Microsoft competes against Amazon Web Services division to sell those cloud services. But it has been in the console gaming business with its Xbox device since 2001 and had 64 million users for its XBox Live online gaming service.

The service requires a technology called machine learning, which Microsoft has refined through its Xbox Live service over the years, he said.","273":"(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp MSFT.O co-founder Paul Allen, the man who persuaded school-friend Bill Gates to drop out of Harvard to start what became the world's biggest software company, died on Monday at the age of 65, his family said.  Allen left Microsoft in 1983, before the company became a corporate juggernaut, following a dispute with Gates, but his share of their original partnership allowed him to spend the rest of his life and billions of dollars on yachts, art, rock music, sports teams, brain research and real estate.  Allen died from complications of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, a type of cancer, the Allen family said in a statement.  In early October, Allen had revealed he was being treated for the non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, which he also was treated for in 2009. He had an earlier brush with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, another cancer, in the early 1980s before leaving Microsoft.  Music-lover Allen had a list of high-profile friends in the entertainment business, including U2 singer Bono, but preferred to avoid the limelight at his compound on Mercer Island, across Lake Washington from Seattle, where he grew up.  Allen remained loyal to the Pacific Northwest region, directing more than $2 billion to mostly local philanthropic projects, developing Seattle's South Lake Union tech hub that Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O calls home and building the headquarters of his Allen Institute for Brain Science there.  Gates described Allen as following the Microsoft partnership with a \u201csecond act\u201d focused on strengthening communities and in a statement said, \u201cI am heartbroken by the passing of one of my oldest and dearest friends.\u201d  Current Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella on Monday called him a \u201cquiet and persistent\u201d man who changed the world.  \u201cHe is under-appreciated in Seattle,\u201d said David Brewster, founder of local news website Crosscut.com and the Seattle Weekly newspaper. \u201cHe\u2019s remote and reclusive. There\u2019s too much Howard Hughes in the way he behaves for Seattle truly to appreciate a lot of the good that he does.\u201d  Paul Gardner Allen was born in Seattle on Jan. 21, 1953, the son of a librarian father and teacher mother. He was two years older than Gates but when they met in the computer room at the exclusive Lakeside School in Seattle in 1968, they discovered a shared passion.  \u201cIn those days we were just goofing around, or so we thought,\u201d Gates recalled in his 1995 book \u201c\u0093The Road Ahead.\u201d  Slideshow ( 7 images )  FROM BOSTON TO ALBUQUERQUE  Allen went on to Washington State University but dropped out in 1974 to take a job with Honeywell in Boston. While there, he pestered Gates, who was studying at nearby Harvard, to quit school and join the nascent revolution in personal computing.  Gates finally agreed and in 1975 the two jointly developed BASIC software for the Altair 8800, a clunky desktop computer that cost $400 in kit form.  The pair moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, close to the Altair\u2019s maker, and formed a company. It was Allen\u2019s idea to call it Micro-Soft, an amalgam of microcomputer and software. The hyphen was later dropped.  Allen was in charge of Microsoft\u2019s technical operations for the company\u2019s first eight years, making him one of the handful of people who created early software such as MS-DOS and Word that enabled the PC revolution and thrust Microsoft to the top.  But he had ceased to be on the cutting edge of software development by the early 1980s. He never displayed the commercial instinct of Gates, who generally is credited with powering Microsoft\u2019s rise to ubiquity in the 1990s.  Allen left Microsoft in 1983 after falling out with Gates and his new lieutenant, Steve Ballmer, in December 1982, only months after being diagnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. As he recalled in his 2011 memoir \u201cIdea Man,\u201d he overheard Gates and Ballmer secretly plotting to reduce his ownership stake.  \u201cThey were bemoaning my recent lack of production and discussing how they might dilute my Microsoft equity by issuing options to themselves and other shareholders,\u201d Allen wrote.  Gates and Ballmer later apologized but the damage was done and Allen left Microsoft, although he remained on the board until 2000.  Slideshow ( 7 images )  CANCER BATTLES  Allen recovered from his cancer after radiation treatment but in 2009 was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, another form of blood cancer. He went into remission in April 2010 but the disease resurfaced in 2018.  Allen held onto his share of the company. His 28 percent stake at Microsoft\u2019s initial public offering in 1986 instantly made him a multi-millionaire.  His wealth peaked at about $30 billion in late 1999, according to Forbes magazine, but Allen was hurt by the sharp decline in Microsoft stock after the dot.com bubble burst in 2000 and some unprofitable technology investments.  In October 2018, Forbes magazine estimated his wealth at $21.7 billion and said he was the 44th richest person in the world.  Allen, the owner of 42 U.S. patents, liked to cast himself as a technology visionary who drove Microsoft\u2019s early success and saw the future of connected computing long before the Internet.  \u201cI expect the personal computer to become the kind of thing that people carry with them, a companion that takes notes, does accounting, gives reminders, handles a thousand personal tasks,\u201d Allen wrote in a column in Personal Computing magazine as far back as 1977, long before portable computers became a reality.  In the same year, he outlined an early vision of what turned out to be the Internet to Microcomputer Interface magazine.  \u201cWhat I do see is a home terminal that\u2019s connected to a centralized network by phone lines, fiber optics or some other communication system,\u201d he said. \u201cWith that system you can perhaps put your car up for sale or look for a house in a different city or check out the price of asparagus at the nearest grocery market or check the price of a stock.\u201d  Allen later called this sweeping idea the \u201cwired world,\u201d which has broadly come to fruition. He was not alone in predicting connected computing but was one of the most prominent.  Yet Allen's technology ventures after Microsoft, which focused on areas he thought would grow with the advent of the \"wired world,\" were not as successful. He lost $8 billion in the cable television industry, chiefly with a bad bet on cable company Charter Communications CHTR.O, while technology ventures he bankrolled such as Metricom, SkyPix and Interval Research were costly failures.  SPORTS TEAMS, A YACHT AND HENDRIX  He had better luck in sports and real estate. Allen bought the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team in 1988 and became a local hero in 1997 when he purchased the Seattle Seahawks football franchise after the previous owner had tried to move the team to California. The Seahawks won the Super Bowl in February 2014 and both franchises are now valued at many times what Allen paid for them.  Allen also made hundreds of millions of dollars redeveloping South Lake Union, a shabby area of downtown Seattle that became a gleaming technology Mecca and site of Amazon.com\u2019s glass \u201cspheres\u201d headquarters.  All the while, the never-married Allen pursued myriad personal projects and pastimes. He owned one of the world\u2019s biggest yachts, the 400-foot (122 meters) Octopus, which was the venue for many lavish parties and the base for scuba expeditions.  A rock \u2018n\u2019 roll aficionado, Allen had a band on call to jam with when he wanted, and spent more than $250 million building a museum devoted to his hero, Jimi Hendrix, which morphed into a music and science fiction exhibit designed by Frank Gehry.  He spent millions more on a collection of vintage warplanes and funded the first non-government rocket to make it into space. He also collected priceless antiquities and works by Monet, Rodin and Rothko to put in his extensive art collection.  Like Gates, Allen was a dedicated philanthropist, giving away more than $1.5 billion in his lifetime and pledging to donate more than half his wealth to charity.  Through various vehicles, Allen focused his giving on brain science, motivated by the loss of his mother to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, along with universities and libraries.","274":"June 11 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp will not sell its facial-recognition technology to police departments until there is a federal law regulating the tech, the Washington Post reported on Thursday, citing the software maker\u2019s president, Brad Smith.

Gates, in fairness, has given vast sums to charity and done much to improve humanity\u2019s lot. That\u2019s Musk\u2019s future challenge.  The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation had given away $55 billion at the end of 2019. Covid-19 has made 2020 a busy year for the philanthropic outfit. The Gates Foundation seeded and has given at least $4 billion to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance which has immunized over 800 million children against diseases like polio and measles. And an offshoot of Gavi has raised $2 billion so far to fight the pandemic, which is enough to reserve 1 billion doses of vaccine for poor countries.  While Musk said in 2012 he would eventually give at least half his wealth away, he doesn\u2019t appear to have done much yet. Instead, Musk has been focused on developing electric cars and spacecraft, which has sent his worth up by about $100 billion this year. That gives him all the more to donate in future should he stick to his word. Moreover, helping fight global warming and colonizing Mars might end up being even more important for humanity than ending a pandemic, over the long run. This needn\u2019t be the last time Musk takes a title from his Seattle-based fellow plutocrat.","276":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp and BMW Group on Tuesday launched an initiative to create an Open Manufacturing Platform that seeks to stimulate innovation and accelerate the development of \u2018smart\u2019 factories.

The New York Stock Exchange with a Hims & Hers Health, Inc banner is pictured as a person runs past in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., January 21, 2021. REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri  After leading markets higher for most of 2020, technology-related stocks took a backseat late last year to so-called value or cyclical plays, whose businesses are expected to gain the most from the economic revival promised by vaccines against COVID-19.  That shift has stalled in recent days as investors weighed lackluster outlooks from big banks and a blockbuster quarterly report from Netflix that lifted its shares by 17%. The Russell 1000 growth index was up 3.3% in the past week as of Friday morning, while its value counterpart fell 1.5%.  Next week\u2019s crop of fourth-quarter results - with about a quarter of the S&P 500 reporting - could help determine whether the resurgence in growth stocks will continue, potentially threatening the recent rally in value and cyclical shares, said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services.  \u201cThat is probably going to be the story of earnings season,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat will earnings mean in terms of the sustainability of this rotation that has occurred in the last eight, nine weeks.\u201d  Steady growth and resilience in the face of the coronavirus pandemic made technology stocks desirable to investors, who poured money into the sector as widespread lockdowns devastated swaths of the U.S. economy.  But a resumption in tech outperformance could also revive concerns over investor crowding into popular names. The biggest five technology-related companies account for about 22% of the weight of the S&P 500.  Aside from Apple and Microsoft, other tech sector companies due to report next week include payment processing firms Visa and Mastercard and semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices. Tesla, whose explosive share price turned the electric car maker into one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, reports on Wednesday.  So far, corporate profits have been strong across the board: Of 66 S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings, 87.9% have beaten Wall Street estimates, well above the long-term average of 65%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Investors are particularly watching corporate outlooks, given the expectation of an economic rebound this year. Earnings are expected to rise 23.7% this year after falling 14.1% in 2020, according to Refinitiv.  While the tech sector\u2019s earnings held up relatively well in 2020, its expected profit growth of 14% in 2021 is below the S&P 500 overall and lags areas such as financials, industrials and materials. \u201cThe risk is in situations where you have had such a good 2020, which is going to be capped off by this reporting next week, what do you do for an encore?\u201d said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital.

Analysts on average expect the company to report a 13% rise in quarterly earnings.  Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners, is eager to learn how well Microsoft is making inroads with its work-from-home products. The software giant is expected to post an 8.7% rise in earnings.  Facebook, estimated to report a 25% rise in earnings, could field questions around any fallout for the social media business from the U.S. elections and banning of President Donald Trump from various platforms, investors said.

Microsoft shares, up more than 21 percent over the past 12 months, rose 2.5 percent in after-hours trading.  Much of Microsoft\u2019s recent growth has been fueled by its cloud computing business, which has benefited from companies rushing to shift their workloads to the cloud to cut data storage and software costs.

Revenue growth in the first quarter ended September was 76 percent, down from 89 percent growth in the fourth quarter.  Microsoft\u2019s focus on fast-growing cloud applications and platforms is helping it beat slowing demand for personal computers that has hurt sales of its popular Windows operating system.  Revenue from Microsoft\u2019s personal computing division, its largest by revenue, rose 14.6 percent to $10.75 billion. That figure beat the analyst estimate of $10.13 billion.

The nine justices will hear arguments in a case that pits the interests of tech companies and privacy advocates in safeguarding customer data against the demands of law enforcement in obtaining information crucial to criminal and counterterrorism investigations.  The case began with a 2013 warrant obtained by prosecutors for emails of a suspect in a drug trafficking investigation that were stored in Microsoft computer servers in Dublin. The company challenged whether a domestic warrant covered data stored abroad. The Justice Department said because Microsoft is based in the United States, prosecutors were entitled to the data.  A ruling is due by the end of June.  A 2016 decision by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals siding with Microsoft marked a victory for tech firms that increasingly offer cloud computing services in which data is stored remotely. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court.  The appeals court said the emails were beyond the reach of domestic search warrants obtained under a 1986 U.S. law called the Stored Communications Act.  Globally dominant American tech companies have expressed concern that customers will go elsewhere if they think the U.S. government\u2019s reach extends to data centers all around the world without changes being made to the law.  Microsoft, which has 100 data centers in 40 countries, was the first American company to challenge a domestic search warrant seeking data held outside the United States.  Bipartisan legislation has been introduced in Congress to update the statute, a move backed by both Microsoft and the administration. If Congress were to pass the bill before the Supreme Court rules, the case would likely become moot.  The Microsoft customer whose emails were sought told the company he was based in Ireland when he signed up for his account.  Other companies including IBM Corp, Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google filed court papers backing Microsoft.  The administration has the support of 35 states led by Vermont.","285":"FILE PHOTO: 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen placed on a keyboard in this illustration taken March 25, 2020.

AnyVision, which denied to NBC such use of its services, did not respond to a request for comment.  The probe reflects growing unease about facial recognition surveillance in the United States and elsewhere that civil liberties groups say could lead to unfair arrests and limit freedom of expression.  Microsoft announced facial recognition ethics principles last year, saying the company would \u201cadvocate for safeguards for people\u2019s democratic freedoms in law enforcement surveillance scenarios and will not deploy facial recognition technology in scenarios that we believe will put these freedoms at risk.\u201d  Microsoft said in a statement that Holder would lead a team from law firm Covington & Burling to conduct the probe. Holder, the top U.S. legal official under former President Barack Obama, was hired by Uber Technologies Inc UBER.N in 2017 to review claims of sexual harassment.  He did not immediately return a request for comment.  M12, the venture fund of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, participated in a $74 million series A investment round that AnyVision announced in June.  NBC had reported that AnyVision\u2019s technology was used within the West Bank and at Israeli border crossings. The company told NBC its software was not used for West Bank surveillance and was deployed at border crossings in a manner similar to U.S. Customs\u2019 use of biometric identification at airports.  Israel faces criticism and a boycott for its occupation and policies toward Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.  AnyVision in an August blog post also said that it would announce an ethics advisory board and that it had a responsibility to prevent its technology\u2019s abuse. At the same time, it touted how facial recognition speeds up border crossings while helping law enforcement spot criminals.  Microsoft itself markets a facial recognition tool and backed a U.S. Senate bill, announced on Thursday, that would require a court order before federal law enforcement could use the technology for targeted, ongoing surveillance.  Neema Singh Guliani, senior legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the bill \u201cfalls woefully short of protecting people\u2019s privacy rights.\u201d","287":"April 27 (Reuters) - Digimarc Corp:  * MICROSOFT AND DIGIMARC PARTNER TO INTEGRATE SCANNING SOFTWARE IN WINDOWS\u00ae 10 OPERATING SYSTEM  * DIGIMARC CORP - ANNOUNCED A NEW 15-YEAR PARTNERSHIP WITH MICROSOFT Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","288":"(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said it has tracked \u201csignificant\u201d cyberattacks coming from a group it calls \u201cStrontium\u201d or \u201cFancy Bear\u201d, targeting anti-doping authorities and global sporting organizations.

Apple shares fell 0.5 percent to $178.58 on the day, adding up to a market value of $847.4 billion.

Both companies\u2019 market capitalizations were calculated using outstanding shares reported in their most recent 10-Q filings.  Apple\u2019s market capitalization overtook Microsoft\u2019s in 2010 as Microsoft struggled with slow demand for personal computers, due in part to the explosion of smartphones like the iPhone.  After Satya Nadella took over as chief executive in 2014, Microsoft reduced its reliance on Windows software for PCs and became a major player in cloud computing, second only to Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.  In recent months, technology shares have been punished by investors worried about rising interest rates and the potential consequences of the U.S.-China trade war.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Thursday announced a new cloud-based tool designed to help corporate customers understand where data is scattered throughout their operations and whether they are in compliance with data privacy regulations.  Once known for its Windows operating system and applications such as Office, Microsoft has built a large business in cloud computing, helping store and process huge amounts of data for corporate customers.  Last year, it introduced a tool called Azure Synapse that is being used by companies such as FedEx Corp to analyze the flow of its 16 million daily packages.  But for large companies, stores of data have become so large, and distributed across so many countries, that Microsoft is rolling out a tool called Azure Purview to help companies better understand precisely what information they have and where it resides.  In particular, the tool is designed to help data privacy and risk management officials ensure their companies are in compliance with rules such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, John \u201cJG\u201d Chirapurath, vice president of Azure data, artificial intelligence and edge, told Reuters in an interview.

The attempted intrusions, many of which were internally flagged by Microsoft Corp over the summer, were carried out by a group often nicknamed \u201cFancy Bear.\u201d The hackers\u2019 activity provides insight into how Russian intelligence is targeting the United States in the run-up to the Nov. 3 election.  The targets identified by Reuters, which include the Center for American Progress, the Council on Foreign Relations and the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said they had not seen any evidence of successful hacking attempts.  Fancy Bear is controlled by Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency and was responsible for hacking the email accounts of Hillary Clinton\u2019s staff in the run-up to the 2016 election, according to a Department of Justice indictment filed in 2018.  News of the Russian hacking activity follows last month's announcement here by Microsoft that Fancy Bear had attempted to hack more than 200 organizations, many of which the software company said were tied to the 2020 election. Microsoft was able to link this year's cyber espionage campaign to the Russian hackers through an apparent programming error that allowed the company to identify a pattern of attack unique to Fancy Bear, according to a Microsoft assessment reviewed by Reuters.  Microsoft declined to comment on Reuters\u2019 findings.  The thrust of espionage operations could not be determined by Reuters. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in August here that Russian operations were attempting to undermine the campaign of presidential candidate Joe Biden.  Democratic National Committee spokesman Chris Meagher said it was \u201cno surprise\u201d that foreign actors were attempting to interfere with the election.  The Russian Embassy in Washington said it does not interfere in America\u2019s internal affairs and denied any link to \u201cFancy Bear,\u201d calling the allegation \u201cfake news.\u201d  The Trump campaign did not return messages.  Over the summer, a specialized cybersecurity unit at Microsoft and federal law enforcement agents notified many of the targets who were in Fancy Bear\u2019s crosshairs, according to six people with knowledge of the matter. Reuters identified SKDKnickerbocker, a lobbying firm allied with Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, as one of them last month.  The targeting of Democrats in Indiana and California - confirmed by four people familiar with the matter - suggests that the Russians are \u201ccasting their net wide,\u201d said Don Smith of cybersecurity company Secureworks.  The Indiana Democratic Party said in a statement it was \u201cunaware of any successful intrusions.\u201d California Democratic Party Chair Rusty Hicks acknowledged being targeted, but stopped short of naming Fancy Bear, saying in an email that \u201cthe effort by the foreign entity was unsuccessful.\u201d  The FBI declined comment.  ATTACKS ON INFLUENTIAL NON-PROFITS  Fancy Bear also targeted think tanks and foreign policy organizations that hold sway in Washington and have, in the past, provided staff for presidential administrations.  Among them was the Center for American Progress (CAP), a left-leaning group whose founder, John Podesta, was at the center of the 2016 Russian hack and leak operation, according to a person with direct knowledge of the incident.  A CAP spokesperson said the organization had not been breached and declined further comment.  The Open Society Foundations, one of the first organizations to see its correspondence leaked to the public by Fancy Bear in 2016, was targeted by the Kremlin again earlier this year, according to two people briefed on the matter. The group\u2019s founder, George Soros, has provided substantial funding to pro-democracy causes and is a regular target of Russian disinformation as well as domestic conspiracy theories.  In a statement, the Open Society said \u201cobviously tensions are extraordinarily high heading into this election, and we are taking many steps to ensure the safety of our staff.\u201d  Others targeted by Fancy Bear in 2020 included the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment, and the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) - all of whom were notified by Microsoft, according to people familiar with the respective organizations.  A CSIS spokesman declined comment on the hacking activity. A Carnegie spokeswoman confirmed the targeting, but declined to provide further detail.

Once known mostly for its Windows personal computer operating system, the company now relies on revenue growth from its cloud-based computing and software services, most of which are sold to other businesses.  While Microsoft still trails the cloud computing leader Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Amazon Web Services in revenue, it has taken a different approach to the market, designing many of its services to be run in either Microsoft\u2019s Azure data centers, its customers private data centers, or a combination of the two.  Amazon, by contrast, at first asked customers move their data to its own servers, though it too has in recent years moved toward Microsoft\u2019s \u201chybrid\u201d approach.  One new service from Microsoft helps online retailers recommend products based on shopping history and can be combined with a retailer\u2019s existing recommendation engine, said Scott Guthrie, Microsoft\u2019s cloud and artificial intelligence chief.  \u201cThey\u2019re using ours in addition to the existing system they had and seeing some tremendous wins in terms of productivity as part of it,\u201d Guthrie said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be necessarily always a winner takes all.\u201d  Microsoft is also releasing tools to let users make artificial intelligence models without having to write the underlying code. Those models can then be \u201ctrained\u201d using the business owner\u2019s data in Microsoft\u2019s cloud.  The company is also introducing a cloud-based blockchain service. The block chain, a ledger for keeping track of transactions among many participants, is used in the financial technology space, and Microsoft said it is working with JP Morgan Chase & Co on the bank\u2019s Quorum offering.  But Microsoft\u2019s Guthrie said blockchain has other uses, such as the system Microsoft helped Starbucks Corp build to track the coffee as it moves from farms to stores to a customer\u2019s cup.  \u201cThat enables them, from a quality control perspective, to dramatically improve the end-to-end supply chain and deliver a better product,\u201d Guthrie said.  Microsoft also said it is releasing a developer edition of its HoloLens 2 headset that was announced earlier this year. The device, which overlays digital information on the real world, will cost $3,500 and is aimed businesses uses like safety training and complex repair work.","304":"FILE PHOTO: Microsoft President Brad Smith speaks during a company event in Athens, Greece, October 5, 2020.

Lawyers have long pushed for greater gender and racial diversity at law firms, corporate legal departments and in the court system. But the industry still lags other professions.  Liu noted a \u201cgenerational lag,\u201d with a more diverse pipeline of lawyers starting their careers. Female enrollment in U.S. law schools eclipsed male enrollment in 2016, he said.  But another panelist, Microsoft general counsel Dev Stahlkopf, said structural barriers will not be fixed by demographic change alone, such as pressure on women to navigate their careers while raising children. Under 20% of law firm equity partners were women and about 6% were racial or ethnic minorities in 2018, according to the National Association for Law Placement.  Stalkopf said she twice cut her own maternity leave short in order not to miss opportunities at her former law firm.  \u201cWith those kinds of barriers, I think many women find themselves either choosing or needing to opt out,\u201d she said.  She noted that Microsoft has had success with a program that rewards its outside law firms\u2019 diversity efforts, with slower progress, though, on diversity in leadership.  Panelist Benjamin Wilson, chairman of the law firm Beveridge & Diamond, said one way law firms can advance diversity at all levels is through compensation, so that lawyers working on a particular matter share credit more equally.  \u201cWhen that happens the client sees the diverse lawyer differently, the diverse lawyer\u2019s peers at his or her firm see them differently, and most importantly the attorney herself or himself begins to see themselves differently,\u201d he said.  Wilson also cited voluntary pledges by law firms to consider more minorities and women for leadership positions.  Stahlkopf said certain programs are making progress, and the challenge is to improve their reach.  \u201cWe as an industry really are going to need to be thinking about how do we scale this broadly,\u201d she said.","312":"FILE PHOTO: An advertisement is played on a set of large screens at the Microsoft office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S., on January 25, 2017.

The justices heard arguments in the high-profile case on Feb. 27, but President Donald Trump on March 22 signed legislation that makes clear that U.S. judges can issue warrants for such data while giving companies a way to object if the request conflicts with foreign law.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp MSFT.O could re-energize its advertising business with a huge supply of video if it follows through on acquiring TikTok's U.S. operations from ByteDance.  Reuters reported on Friday, citing a source familiar with the matter, that Microsoft is in exploratory deal talks as the U.S. government prepares to force China-based ByteDance to divest its video app TikTok over data security concerns.  Microsoft generates the bulk of its $143 billion in annual revenue by licensing software such as Windows and Office as well as cloud storage and computing tools through its Azure service.  The company, with advertising supported businesses including its Bing search engine, MSN news service and LinkedIn business social network, disclosed this month that its search ads sales grew 1% to $7.7 billion over the last year. But that growth was flat when excluding fees it pays to partner websites and apps.  The ad market research company eMarketer has estimated LinkedIn\u2019s ad revenue at about $2 billion annually in the United States alone. But Microsoft also said this month LinkedIn ads sales have fallen this year as the novel coronavirus pandemic prompted advertisers to pare spending.  Social media services, including Facebook Inc FB.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O YouTube, have seen their sales growth continue during the pandemic as users spend more time entertaining themselves online - particularly with video - and advertisers follow them there.  Without an entertainment service aimed at a broad audience, Microsoft has struggled to capture the increasingly lucrative videos flowing to YouTube, Facebook and more recently TikTok, which widely opened its ad tools this month.  Increased U.S. regulatory scrutiny of potentially anticompetitive behavior by Facebook and YouTube have likely diminished their ability to purchase a major competitor soon, according to antitrust experts. Microsoft, though, faces fewer constraints.  \u201cIts consumer strategy remains in flux and an aggressive acquisition (or strategic investment) of TikTok would be Microsoft throwing its hat in the ring and trying to compete with other tech giants in a new avenue of growth,\u201d Wedbush financial analyst Dan Ives said in a statement on Friday.","314":"An appeals court on Thursday dealt a setback to Microsoft in a patent infringement case brought by the defense contractor Leidos, saying an administrative court\u2019s refusal to review the asserted patents was not appealable.

FILE PHOTO: The Microsoft logo is pictured ahead of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 24, 2019. REUTERS\/Sergio Perez\/File Photo  The decision marks a policy change for the Redmond, Washington-based software maker, which has aimed to shape how the technology industry approaches facial recognition. Microsoft has laid out principles to guide its own development of the technology, saying it should perform without bias and must not impinge on democratic freedoms.  Civil liberties groups have said police use of facial recognition could lead to unfair, arbitrary arrests and limit freedom of expression.  Microsoft came under scrutiny last summer for participating in a $74 million funding round for AnyVision, which critics said contradicted the company\u2019s principles.  AnyVision, based outside Tel Aviv, came under scrutiny following media reports that its technology was used to surveil Palestinians who lived in the occupied West Bank. Microsoft later hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and a team from Covington & Burling to investigate the claims.  The law firm found that AnyVision\u2019s technology was in use at checkpoints in border crossings between Israel and the West Bank - as the startup had said - but that it had not fueled a mass surveillance program there, according to a copy of the audit\u2019s findings posted on the website of M12, Microsoft\u2019s venture fund.  Even so, Microsoft said that as a result of the probe it decided to exit the business of investing in facial recognition startups altogether.  \u201cFor Microsoft, the audit process reinforced the challenges of being a minority investor in a company that sells sensitive technology, since such investments do not generally allow for the level of oversight or control that Microsoft exercises over the use of its own technology,\u201d Microsoft and AnyVision said in a joint statement posted on M12\u2019s website.  Microsoft did not have a timeline to share for when the divestment will occur and who will buy its stake, a spokesman said. It was not immediately clear if other M12 investments were impacted by the policy change.  AnyVision did not immediately comment.  While Microsoft has turned down some facial recognition sales on human rights grounds, such as declining a deal for the capital city of a country that nonprofit Freedom House said was not free, it continues to develop the software for other commercial and public sector uses.

The announcement gave no details of any investment the companies would make, outlining only initial research and other work to be completed over the next five years.  Some aims for net zero carbon emissions include reductions across the entire value chain, including impact of products and services, and the substantial commitment and willingness to invest in and speed innovation.  The current alliance also includes French food group Danone SA DANO.PA, German automaker Mercedes-Benz AG, top shipping container firm A.P.

A deal would be in line with Microsoft\u2019s stance toward China where the firm has a sizeable presence - unlike fellow U.S. tech heavyweights such as Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google which appear to have given up on China\u2019s consumer-facing market with its miscellany of government strictures.  The country accounts for over $2 billion in annual revenue, Microsoft President Brad Smith said earlier this year.  WHAT DOES MICROSOFT DO IN CHINA?  Microsoft employs roughly 6,000 people in the country, with offices in Shanghai, Beijing and Suzhou.  Its flagship Windows operating system is widely used, though revenue has long been crimped by piracy. In recent years the firm has pushed its Azure cloud computing product, launched in 2013 via a partnership with local data service company 21Vianet.  China\u2019s cyber-security law limits Microsoft to providing Azure\u2019s software and services while 21Vianet runs associated data centres. It is a small player in a sector dominated by local providers Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Baidu Inc , Tencent Holdings Ltd and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.  Microsoft operates both its Bing search engine and LinkedIn social network in China, though again is a small player compared with local giants.  Its most important China operation is arguably the Microsoft Research Asia, famous as a leader in artificial intelligence (AI).  Founded in 1998 with help from renowned Taiwanese-American AI scientist Kaifu Lee - who went on to lead Google\u2019s China office - the lab has produced alumni who went on to become executives at TikTok owner ByteDance, Baidu, Xiaomi Corp and Chinese facial recognition unicorns.  DOES MICROSOFT SELF-CENSOR IN CHINA?  Bing and LinkedIn in China appear similar to their global counterparts but Microsoft censors search results and content the Chinese government considers sensitive.  Upon LinkedIn\u2019s China launch in 2014, two years before the company was bought by Microsoft, then-Chief Executive Jeff Weiner said censoring content would be \u201cnecessary\u201d for the firm to grow in the country.  In 2019, free speech advocates criticised LinkedIn\u2019s position on censorship after human rights activist Zhou Fengsuo said his profile was not viewable in China. LinkedIn blamed an \u201cerror\u201d and restored its visibility.  Software development website GitHub, which Microsoft purchased in 2019, is also accessible from China. The site, a coding repository, has been used by activists in China to preserve internet content before authorities censor the source.  HAS MICROSOFT HAD SCRAPES WITH CHINA\u2019S GOVERNMENT?  Microsoft has bemoaned rampant piracy of Windows in China for decades and has occasionally filed lawsuits and complaints even against state-backed companies to address its concerns.  Its most notable tussle with the government was in 2014 when authorities raided four Microsoft offices demanding access to contracts and other information as part of an anti-trust investigation.  The same year, the government called on all agencies to ban the purchase of Windows 8 citing security reasons.  Microsoft eventually released a \u201cChina Government\u201d edition of Windows 10 following a joint venture formed in 2015 with state-owned China Electronics Technology Corp.  WHAT ABOUT BILL GATES?  Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has spoken in mostly positive terms about China in recent years. In November, he held a public meeting with Peng Liyuan, wife of President Xi Jinping.  Also late last year, Gates criticised the U.S. government\u2019s restrictions on telecommunications equipment maker Huawei and spoke about sharing Windows source code with China\u2019s government which aided official acceptance of the software in the country.  He has praised China\u2019s response to COVID-19, which earned him public thanks from Xi, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has donated $5 million to China for COVID-19 relief.  The foundation is one of few overseas charities or non-governmental organisations to maintain operations in China, where it has worked with the government and academic institutions against diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis.

The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield moved back above the symbolic 3 percent mark on Tuesday and hit its highest in four months on Wednesday, while two-year rates reached 2.8 percent, the highest in over a decade.  Rises in market interest rates tend to boost banks and the S&P financial sector rose 1.64 percent, lifted by a 2.6 percent increase in shares of JPMorgan & Chase. The KBW bank index was up 1.90 percent.  Also helping lift yields was data that showed U.S. homebuilding increased more than expected in August.  When yields are high, investors tend to favor bonds over defensive sectors such as utilities, consumer staples and real estate, which promise high dividends.  \u201cThe yield curve seems to be holding steady with the 10-year above 3 percent, which bodes well for the financial group and investors are seeing broader economic stability,\u201d said Terry Sandven, chief equities strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.  The Dow Industrials was about 0.6 percent away from a fresh record high after touching its highest since Jan. 29.  The technology sector dropped 0.50 percent, led by a 1.9 percent decline in Microsoft and a 0.2 percent decline in shares of Apple.  Microsoft on Tuesday raised its quarterly dividend by about 10 percent, but Morgan Stanley said the hike was below the company\u2019s 12-month trailing operating income growth.  Five of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher. The Dow Industrials was boosted by a 2.5 percent gain in Caterpillar and 1.7 percent rise in Boeing.  But the utilities fell 1.71 percent, the most among the 11 major S&P sectors.  At 12:49 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 191.94 points, or 0.73 percent, at 26,438.90, the S&P 500 was up 2.79 points, or 0.10 percent, at 2,907.10 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 31.21 points, or 0.39 percent, at 7,924.90.  U.S.-China trade spat continues to weigh on the minds of analysts and investors but the broad conclusion from this week\u2019s exchange of blows was that China may be running out of options, given how much less it imports from the United States.  \u201cWe are not currently at a trade escalation, we are at status quo,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York.  Goldman Sachs was up 2.5 percent, after Reuters reported that the company was in advanced talks with several financial companies to spin off its app, which sells complex financial products to retail investors.  Copart Inc tumbled 16.5 percent, the most on the S&P, after the online vehicle auction company fell short of profit estimates, hurt by higher costs from the impact of Hurricane Harvey.  Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.11-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.09-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.  The S&P index recorded 31 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 44 new highs and 38 new lows.

Technology firms Apple Inc and Microsoft Inc fell in premarket trading after a recent rally that was spurred by investors looking for stocks likely to withstand an economic hit.

The blue-chip Dow is on course for its biggest quarterly percentage decline since 1987 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq is set to close out its worst first three months of the year since 2008.  \u201cIt\u2019s the last day of the quarter, and it\u2019s been a quarter to forget, a horrible quarter,\u201d said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.  \u201cThere is a good chance that the lower open can reverse during the course of the day because bargain hunting is now coming into the picture.\u201d  At 08:38 a.m. EDT, Dow e-minis were down 166 points, or 0.75%, S&P 500 e-minis were down 21.25 points, or 0.81% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 45.25 points, or 0.58%.  Oil stocks were among the big premarket gainers, boosted by a rebound in prices from 18-year lows after the United States and Russia agreed to discuss stabilizing energy markets.  The energy sector has been the worst performer this year, losing more than half its value.  Investors have so far largely shrugged off figures showing the extent of the economic damage from the statewide lockdowns.

The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) is seen through the rain in Washington, D.C., October 29, 2020. REUTERS\/Raphael Satter  The attempted intrusions, many of which were internally flagged by Microsoft Corp MSFT.O over the summer, were carried out by a group often nicknamed \"Fancy Bear.\" The hackers' activity provides insight into how Russian intelligence is targeting the United States in the run-up to the Nov. 3 election.  The targets identified by Reuters, which include the Center for American Progress, the Council on Foreign Relations and the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said they had not seen any evidence of successful hacking attempts.  Fancy Bear is controlled by Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency and was responsible for hacking the email accounts of Hillary Clinton\u2019s staff in the run-up to the 2016 election, according to a Department of Justice indictment filed in 2018.  News of the Russian hacking activity follows last month's announcement here by Microsoft that Fancy Bear had attempted to hack more than 200 organizations, many of which the software company said were tied to the 2020 election. Microsoft was able to link this year's cyber espionage campaign to the Russian hackers through an apparent programming error that allowed the company to identify a pattern of attack unique to Fancy Bear, according to a Microsoft assessment reviewed by Reuters.  Microsoft declined to comment on Reuters\u2019 findings, citing customer privacy. But Tom Burt, corporate vice president, customer security and trust, said in a statement that the company - and the U.S. government - \u201chave been working hard to keep this election safe and secure.\u201d  The thrust of espionage operations could not be determined by Reuters. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in August here that Russian operations were attempting to undermine the campaign of presidential candidate Joe Biden.  Democratic National Committee spokesman Chris Meagher said it was \u201cno surprise\u201d that foreign actors were attempting to interfere with the election.  The Russian Embassy in Washington said it does not interfere in America\u2019s internal affairs and denied any link to \u201cFancy Bear,\u201d calling the allegation \u201cfake news.\u201d  The Trump campaign did not return messages.  Over the summer, a specialized cybersecurity unit at Microsoft and federal law enforcement agents notified many of the targets who were in Fancy Bear\u2019s crosshairs, according to six people with knowledge of the matter. Reuters last month identified SKDKnickerbocker, a lobbying firm allied with Biden, as one of them.  The targeting of Democrats in Indiana and California - confirmed by four people familiar with the matter - suggests that the Russians are \u201ccasting their net wide,\u201d said Don Smith of cybersecurity company Secureworks.  The Indiana Democratic Party said in a statement it was \u201cunaware of any successful intrusions.\u201d California Democratic Party Chair Rusty Hicks acknowledged being targeted, but stopped short of naming Fancy Bear, saying in an email that \u201cthe effort by the foreign entity was unsuccessful.\u201d  The FBI declined comment.  ATTACKS ON INFLUENTIAL NON-PROFITS Fancy Bear also targeted think tanks and foreign policy organizations that hold sway in Washington and have, in the past, provided staff for presidential administrations.  Among them was the Center for American Progress (CAP), a left-leaning group whose founder, John Podesta, was at the center of the 2016 Russian hack and leak operation, according to a person with direct knowledge of the incident.  A CAP spokesperson said the organization had not been breached and declined further comment. The Open Society Foundations, one of the first organizations to see its correspondence leaked to the public by Fancy Bear in 2016, was targeted by the Kremlin again earlier this year, according to two people briefed on the matter. The group\u2019s founder, George Soros, has provided substantial funding to pro-democracy causes and is a regular target of Russian disinformation as well as domestic conspiracy theories.  In a statement, the Open Society said \u201cobviously tensions are extraordinarily high heading into this election, and we are taking many steps to ensure the safety of our staff.\u201d  Others targeted by Fancy Bear in 2020 included the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment, and the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) - all of whom were notified by Microsoft, according to people familiar with the respective organizations.  A CSIS spokesman declined comment on the hacking activity. A Carnegie spokeswoman confirmed the targeting, but declined to provide further detail.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp MSFT.O on Wednesday beat Wall Street sales and profit expectations, powered by sharp demand for its Teams chat and online meeting app and Xbox gaming services as the world shifted to working and playing from home because of the novel coronavirus pandemic.  The company\u2019s shares, up over 12% this year, rose about 5% in extended trading.  The results reflect Chief Executive Satya Nadella's focus over his six-year tenure on cloud computing, in which companies tap Microsoft's data centers for computing power - a growing business dominated by Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O Amazon Web Services.  For the fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft gave business-unit forecasts that were below analyst estimates, predicting tough times for LinkedIn and some small-business software sales.  \u201cUltimately, Microsoft is not immune from what is going on broadly in the world in terms of GDP growth,\u201d Nadella said on a conference call with investors.  But results benefited from sales of its Windows operating system and Surface hardware devices as people upgraded personal computers to work or study from home. Microsoft also cited all-time-high engagement on its Xbox Live gaming service, with 90 million monthly active users.  \u201cThe biggest missed opportunity was in Surface, where demand was huge, the channel inventory was depleted, and supply chain constraints reduced finished goods output,\u201d said Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead. \u201cI believe the company could have easily sold 15-20% more if available.\u201d  Microsoft also benefited from strong demand for its Teams collaboration software, which Nadella said on a conference call now has 75 million daily active users and competes with Zoom Video Communications Inc ZM.O and Slack Technologies Inc WORK.N. The demand influx strained Microsoft's data centers, forcing it to limit new cloud customers' usage and prioritize healthcare and government users.  In an interview, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said some of the increased Teams usage came from subscribers with access to the software as part of a broader package and turned it on for the first time. In other cases, Hood said, Microsoft offered Teams in a free trial to large customers.  \u201cIn those instances, you also won\u2019t see revenue, but seeing great usage obviously is terrific for us longer term if people want to convert that to a paying seat,\u201d Hood said. \u201cWhile I\u2019m really excited about the long-term potential for revenue, you won\u2019t see it in this (fiscal third) quarter, or really even in Q4. It\u2019s more about people being more and more engaged with Microsoft products.\u201d  Responding to analysts\u2019 questions, Microsoft executives declined to specify when they would start charging Teams customers on free trials. \u201cImmediate term, we are mostly building out the relationships, adding new customers, adding intensity and usage in existing relationships,\u201d Nadella said on the call.  Third-quarter sales were helped by demand for cloud services. However, Azure growth slowed to 59% from 62% in the second quarter, which company officials said was a result of how large the business has become.  \u201cDespite the slowed growth, (Azure) operates at approximately 10 times the scale of Google (by annual revenues) and has seen better enterprise adoption so far,\u201d said Daniel Elman, an analyst at Nucleus Research.  Microsoft said revenue for its \u201ccommercial cloud,\u201d a combination of Azure and the cloud-based versions of software such as Office, rose 39% to $13.3 billion.  The business\u2019 gross profit margin, a key measure of cloud profitability that Microsoft has told investors it expects to improve, was 67% versus 63% last year.  Microsoft also said capital expenditure was $3.9 billion, up from $3.4 billion a year earlier and less than the $4.5 billion the previous quarter. However, Hood told Reuters that supply chain constraints due to the coronavirus pandemic had delayed some spending to build Azure data centers, which will likely be higher next quarter as the company works to catch up.  Revenue in the Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, rose 27% to $12.28 billion, beating analysts\u2019 consensus estimate of $11.87 billion according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Revenue rose 15% to $35.02 billion in the third quarter ending March 31, beating estimates of $33.66 billion.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  Last week, Microsoft won the Pentagon contract termed Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, or JEDI, that will be worth up to $10 billion over a period of 10 years, beating out favorite Amazon\u2019s AWS.

Amazon\u2019s Amazon Web Services currently holds about 32% of the cloud computing market, while Microsoft\u2019s Azure has about 18%, according to research firm Canalys.  While AWS contributes nearly 13% to Amazon\u2019s total net sales, Azure accounts for about 33% of Microsoft\u2019s revenue and are both a major cash cow for the companies.  Friday\u2019s decision came after months of controversy and protest over the process for awarding the deal and even drawing the attention of President Donald Trump, who has publicly taken swipes at Amazon, long considered the frontrunner.  Analysts at brokerage firm Compass Point said the deal was a \u201csignificant victory\u201d for Microsoft over AWS and added that Amazon could challenge the decision.  \u201cWe expect a degree of handwringing among Congressional Democrats given the political and practical dimensions of this issue, but our sense is that lawmakers are unlikely to wade too deeply into these waters,\u201d Compass Point\u2019s Marshall Senk said.  Brokerages Mizuho and Independent Research raised their price target on the Microsoft stock at the prospect of the company getting a boost from the contract.  \u201cIn the end, the fact that Azure was chosen as the sole provider for this important project is a testament to just how far it has come over the past couple of years,\u201d said Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz, who raised his price target by $8 to $160.  Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives noted that the deal helps Microsoft gain a bigger chunk of an estimated $1 trillion of next decade cloud business and $100 billion of U.S. government business.

Aided by a series of U.S. court orders and relationships with technology providers in other countries, Microsoft said it its weeklong campaign against the gang running the Trickbot network was heading off a possible source of disruption to the Nov. 3 U.S. vote.  \u201cWe\u2019ve taken down most of their infrastructure,\u201d corporate Vice President Tom Burt said in an interview. \u201cTheir ability to go and infect targets has been significantly reduced.\u201d  The criminals in charge of Trickbot have infected more than 1 million personal computers, including many inside local governments, according to cybersecurity professionals. They then make deals with other gangs to install ransomware and other malicious programs on the infected machines, security professionals say.  Although there is no evidence that the gang has worked with foreign governments, Burt said he wanted to disrupt Trickbot before the election in case Russian agencies attempted to use it to interfere with voting or cast doubt on the results by manipulating data.  Some security experts who had seen little impact from Microsoft\u2019s initial efforts to combat Trickbot said this week that new control servers being brought online by the gang were getting cut off, making it harder for the group to install new programs on infected computers.  \u201cDisruption operations against Trickbot are currently global in nature and have had success against Trickbot infrastructure,\u201d said Intel 471 Chief Executive Mark Arena. \u201cRegardless, there still is a small number of working controllers based in Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and Kyrgyzstan that still are able to respond.\u201d  The Trickbot gang is now asking other malware groups to install its software, Arena and others said, and it is expected to rebuild its infrastructure in other ways.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  The company\u2019s shares rose 5% in extended trading after gaining about 41% in 2020 as COVID-19 shifted computing to areas where the software maker has bet big. It also saw a surprise recovery in sales on the LinkedIn professional social network and navigated a chip shortage that had threaten to hold back its Xbox business.  The shift to work from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated enterprises\u2019 switch to cloud-based computing, benefiting Microsoft and rivals such as Amazon.com Inc\u2019s cloud unit and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google Cloud.  On a conference call with investors, Microsoft executives said they expect a midpoint of $14.83 billion in revenue from the company\u2019s \u201cIntelligent Cloud\u201d segment for the fiscal third quarter, compared with Wall Street expectations of $14.12 billion, according to Refinitiv data. For the company\u2019s productivity segment and its personal computing segment, sales are expected to have a respective midpoint of $13.48 billion and $12.50 billion, compared with estimates of $12.90 billion and $11.60 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  Microsoft said GamePass, the company\u2019s $10 monthly gaming subscription, has 18 million users, up from 15 million disclosed in September. The Xbox Live online gaming service has more than 100 million monthly active users. Microsoft did not give an update on the 115 million Teams daily users it disclosed in October but did say that the mobile version is used by 60 million daily users.  Microsoft said revenue in its \u201cIntelligent Cloud\u201d segment rose 23% to $14.6 billion, with 50% growth in Azure. Analysts had expected a 41.4% growth in Azure, according to consensus data from Visible Alpha. The previous quarter Azure grew 48%.  \u201cThis was really driven by continued customer demand, with stronger-than-expected consumption as customers have increased their focus on digital transformation,\u201d Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood told Reuters in an interview.  Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said that last year, \u201ceconomic weakness and delays in implementation had masked the extent to which Azure was benefiting from the accelerated shift to the cloud caused by the pandemic. But with these results that benefit is now plain to see.\u201d  (GRAPHIC: Microsoft Azure growth rate gradually recovers: )  LinkedIn revenue growth, which dipped as the pandemic shut down businesses, reached 23%, near its pre-pandemic rate of 24% a year earlier. Hood said advertisements on LinkedIn drove the increase.  \u201cWe continue to see advertising market recovery,\u201d she said.  Microsoft bundles several sets of software and services such as Office and Azure into a \u201ccommercial cloud\u201d metric that investors watch closely to gauge the company\u2019s progress in selling to large businesses.  Commercial cloud gross margins - a measure of the profitability of its sales to large businesses - were 71% in the quarter, compared with 67% a year earlier.  Revenue from its personal computing division, which includes Windows software and Xbox gaming consoles, rose 14% to $15.1 billion, driven by strong Xbox content and services growth, beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $13.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Microsoft in November released two new Xbox consoles, its most visible non-work and non-school brand, but the hardware proved difficult to find as a global semiconductor shortage contributed to tight stocks as many retailers. Xbox hardware sales were up 86% despite the shortages, and Hood said growth is likely to continue, with older models also contributing to sales.  \u201cDemand still outpaces supply, and we do expect that to continue,\u201d Hood said. \u201cThe team did a nice job of getting consoles, both of this newest generation as well as continuing to sell the older generation, which provides a great value for gamers.\u201d  Microsoft\u2019s gaming business topped $5 billion in quarterly sales for the first time ever and was propelled by gaming subscriptions and sales as well as new consoles. Microsoft said Xbox content and services revenue grew 40% in the quarter.  The software giant\u2019s overall revenue rose to $43.08 billion in the second quarter ended Dec. 31, from $36.91 billion a year earlier, beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $40.18 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.","342":"","343":"Jan 14 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Tuesday it will roll out a security fix that cybersecurity experts expect will correct a highly dangerous weakness in its popular Windows operating system.

The NSA had previously come under criticism after it took advantage of vulnerabilities in Microsoft products to deploy hacking tools against adversaries and kept the Redmond, Washington-based company in the dark about it for years. When one of those tools was dramatically leaked to the internet by a group calling itself ShadowBrokers, it was deployed against targets around the globe by hackers of all stripes.  In the most dramatic case, a group used the tool to unleash a massive malware outbreak dubbed WannaCry in 2017.

Allen left Microsoft in 1983, before the company became a corporate juggernaut, following a dispute with Gates, but his share of their original partnership allowed him to spend the rest of his life and billions of dollars on yachts, art, rock music, sports teams, brain research and real estate.  Allen died from complications of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, a type of cancer, the Allen family said in a statement.  In early October, Allen had revealed he was being treated for the non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, which he also was treated for in 2009. He had an earlier brush with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, another cancer, in the early 1980s before leaving Microsoft.  Music-lover Allen had a list of high-profile friends in the entertainment business, including U2 singer Bono, but preferred to avoid the limelight at his compound on Mercer Island, across Lake Washington from Seattle, where he grew up.  Allen remained loyal to the Pacific Northwest region, directing more than $1 billion to mostly local philanthropic projects, developing Seattle\u2019s South Lake Union tech hub that Amazon.com Inc calls home and building the headquarters of his Allen Institute for Brain Science there.  \u201cHe is under-appreciated in Seattle,\u201d said David Brewster, founder of local news website Crosscut.com and the Seattle Weekly newspaper. \u201cHe\u2019s remote and reclusive. There\u2019s too much Howard Hughes in the way he behaves for Seattle truly to appreciate a lot of the good that he does.\u201d  Paul Gardner Allen was born in Seattle on Jan. 21, 1953, the son of a librarian father and teacher mother. He was two years older than Gates but when they met in the computer room at the exclusive Lakeside School in Seattle in 1968, they discovered a shared passion.  \u201cIn those days we were just goofing around, or so we thought,\u201d Gates recalled in his 1995 book \u201c\u0093The Road Ahead.\u201d  FROM BOSTON TO ALBUQUERQUE  Allen went on to Washington State University but dropped out in 1974 to take a job with Honeywell in Boston. While there, he pestered Gates, who was studying at nearby Harvard, to quit school and join the nascent revolution in personal computing.  Gates finally agreed and in 1975 the two jointly developed BASIC software for the Altair 8800, a clunky desktop computer that cost $400 in kit form.  The pair moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, close to the Altair\u2019s maker, and formed a company. It was Allen\u2019s idea to call it Micro-Soft, an amalgam of microcomputer and software. The hyphen was later dropped.  Allen was in charge of Microsoft\u2019s technical operations for the company\u2019s first eight years, making him one of the handful of people who created early software such as MS-DOS and Word that enabled the PC revolution and thrust Microsoft to the top.  But he had ceased to be on the cutting edge of software development by the early 1980s. He never displayed the commercial instinct of Gates, who generally is credited with powering Microsoft\u2019s rise to ubiquity in the 1990s.  Allen left Microsoft in 1983 after falling out with Gates and his new lieutenant, Steve Ballmer, in December 1982, only months after being diagnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. As he recalled in his 2011 memoir \u201cIdea Man,\u201d he overheard Gates and Ballmer secretly plotting to reduce his ownership stake.  \u201cThey were bemoaning my recent lack of production and discussing how they might dilute my Microsoft equity by issuing options to themselves and other shareholders,\u201d Allen wrote.  Gates and Ballmer later apologized but the damage was done and Allen left Microsoft, although he remained on the board until 2000.  CANCER BATTLES  Allen recovered from his cancer after radiation treatment but in 2009 was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, another form of blood cancer. He went into remission in April 2010 but the disease resurfaced in 2018.  Allen held onto his share of the company. His 28 percent stake at Microsoft\u2019s initial public offering in 1986 instantly made him a multi-millionaire.  His wealth peaked at about $30 billion in late 1999, according to Forbes magazine, but Allen was hurt by the sharp decline in Microsoft stock after the dot.com bubble burst in 2000 and some unprofitable technology investments.  In October 2018, Forbes magazine estimated his wealth at $21.7 billion and said he was the 44th richest person in the world.  Allen, the owner of 42 U.S. patents, liked to cast himself as a technology visionary who drove Microsoft\u2019s early success and saw the future of connected computing long before the Internet.  \u201cI expect the personal computer to become the kind of thing that people carry with them, a companion that takes notes, does accounting, gives reminders, handles a thousand personal tasks,\u201d Allen wrote in a column in Personal Computing magazine as far back as 1977, long before portable computers became a reality.  In the same year, he outlined an early vision of what turned out to be the Internet to Microcomputer Interface magazine.  \u201cWhat I do see is a home terminal that\u2019s connected to a centralized network by phone lines, fiber optics or some other communication system,\u201d he said. \u201cWith that system you can perhaps put your car up for sale or look for a house in a different city or check out the price of asparagus at the nearest grocery market or check the price of a stock.\u201d  Allen later called this sweeping idea the \u201cwired world,\u201d which has broadly come to fruition. He was not alone in predicting connected computing but was one of the most prominent.  Yet Allen\u2019s technology ventures after Microsoft, which focused on areas he thought would grow with the advent of the \u201cwired world,\u201d were not as successful. He lost $8 billion in the cable television industry, chiefly with a bad bet on cable company Charter Communications, while technology ventures he bankrolled such as Metricom, SkyPix and Interval Research were costly failures.  SPORTS TEAMS, A YACHT AND HENDRIX  He had better luck in sports and real estate. Allen bought the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team in 1988 and became a local hero in 1997 when he purchased the Seattle Seahawks football franchise after the previous owner had tried to move the team to California. The Seahawks won the Super Bowl in February 2014 and both franchises are now valued at many times what Allen paid for them.  Allen also made hundreds of millions of dollars redeveloping South Lake Union, a shabby area of downtown Seattle that became a gleaming technology Mecca and site of Amazon.com\u2019s glass \u201cspheres\u201d headquarters.  All the while, the never-married Allen pursued myriad personal projects and pastimes. He owned one of the world\u2019s biggest yachts, the 400-foot (122 meters) Octopus, which was the venue for many lavish parties and the base for scuba expeditions.  A rock \u2018n\u2019 roll aficionado, Allen had a band on call to jam with when he wanted, and spent more than $250 million building a museum devoted to his hero, Jimi Hendrix, which morphed into a music and science fiction exhibit designed by Frank Gehry.  He spent millions more on a collection of vintage warplanes and funded the first non-government rocket to make it into space. He also collected priceless antiquities and works by Monet, Rodin and Rothko to put in his extensive art collection.  Like Gates, Allen was a dedicated philanthropist, giving away more than $1.5 billion in his lifetime and pledging to donate more than half his wealth to charity.  Through various vehicles, Allen focused his giving on brain science, motivated by the loss of his mother to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, along with universities and libraries.

Microsoft had said before that the hackers had accessed some source code, but had not said which parts, or that any had been copied.  U.S. authorities said Wednesday the breaches revealed in December extended to nine federal agencies and 100 private companies, including major technology providers and security firms. They said the Russian government is likely behind the spree, which Moscow has denied.  Initially discovered by security provider FireEye Inc, the hackers used advanced skills to insert software back doors for spying into widely used network-management programs distributed by Texas-based SolarWinds Corp.  At the most prized of the thousands of SolarWinds customers that were exposed last year, the hackers added new Azure identities, added greater rights to existing identities, or otherwise manipulated the Microsoft programs, largely to steal email.  Some hacking also used such methods at targets which did not use SolarWinds. Microsoft previously acknowledged that some of its resellers, who often have continual access to customer systems, had been used in the hacks. It continues to deny that flaws in anything it provides directly have been used as an initial attack vector.  Microsoft declined to answer Reuters\u2019 questions about which parts of its code had been downloaded or whether what the hackers discovered would have helped them hone techniques.  The company also declined to say whether it was changing any of its code as a result of the breach.  The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to questions.  The company said Thursday it had completed its probe and that it had \u201cfound no indications that our systems at Microsoft were used to attack others.\u201d  Nevertheless, the problems with identity management have proved so pervasive in the recent attacks that multiple security companies have issued new guidelines and warnings as well tools for detecting misuse.  President Joe Biden has promised a response to the SolarWinds hacks, and an inquiry and remediation effort is being led by his top cybersecurity official, Deputy National Security Advisor Anne Neuberger.  The Senate Intelligence Committee will hold a hearing on the hacks Tuesday with witnesses including Microsoft President Brad Smith and FireEye Chief Executive Kevin Mandia.","352":"FILE PHOTO: The Microsoft sign is shown on top of the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 19,2018.

The Azure Synapse system, to be unveiled at an event in Florida, is part of the company\u2019s fast-growing cloud computing unit, which has driven the company\u2019s shares up over the past five years. The tool is meant to help companies build out systems that analyze large amounts of data to make better business decisions, such as whether a digital marketing campaign is driving more traffic to stores and websites.  The Synapse aims to solve two problems for businesses building those systems, Rohan Kumar, the corporate vice president of Azure Data, told Reuters in an interview.  The first is that businesses need different software tools to analyze data held in systems like customer databases - where names and addresses sit in neat rows and columns and look like a spreadsheet - versus newer systems like website monitoring tools, where clicks are recorded as a long stream of numbers and time stamps. The Synapse tool is designed to handle both kinds of data, he said.

Microsoft said on Wednesday its supply chain was taking longer to return to normal operations than expected, and its Windows and Surface computers had taken a bigger hit than feared.

The report came as Reuters revealed one of Biden\u2019s main campaign advisory firms had been warned by the software giant that it was in the crosshairs of the same Russian hackers who intervened in the 2016 U.S. election.  The Microsoft statement highlights how advisers to both presidential campaigns are at risk from digital spies around the globe, as the two candidates face off on Nov. 3 in one of the most consequential U.S. presidential elections in decades.  The announcement by Microsoft\u2019s vice president for customer security, Tom Burt, said the group accused of breaching Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign emails in 2016 - a Russian military intelligence-linked unit widely known as Fancy Bear - had spent the past year trying to break into accounts belonging to political consultants serving both Republicans and Democrats as well as advocacy organizations and think tanks.  Burt also said Chinese hackers had gone after people \u201cclosely associated with U.S. presidential campaigns and candidates\u201d - including an unnamed Biden ally who was targeted through a personal email address and \u201cat least one prominent individual formerly associated with the Trump Administration.\u201d  He added that Iranian hackers - which Microsoft has already called out publicly for attempts to spy on a U.S. political campaign that Reuters identified here as being Trump's - had since tried to log into accounts belonging to Trump administration officials and members of the Republican president's campaign staff.  Microsoft\u2019s announcement was planned before Reuters broke the news that Fancy Bear was suspected of targeting Washington-based SKDKnickerbocker, a campaign strategy and communications firm working with Biden and other prominent Democrats.

REUTERS\/Jonathan Ernst  Burt did not name any of the political consultants involved and Microsoft declined to comment on whether SKDK was among the consultants it had identified as targets.  SKDK has declined comment.  Burt said the Chinese effort to compromise the Biden ally and the Iranian spying against the Trump campaign were unsuccessful, but his blog post provided no detail on the hacking campaign attributed to Russia or the effort to compromise the well-known former Trump associate.  Speaking generally, he said that foreign hacking was intensifying as the vote drew nearer.  \u201cThe activity we are announcing today makes clear that foreign activity groups have stepped up their efforts targeting the 2020 election as had been anticipated,\u201d Burt said.  The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s top cyber official, Christopher Krebs, said Microsoft\u2019s warning was consistent with earlier statements issued by the intelligence community about Russian, Chinese, and Iranian spying on election-related targets.  \u201cIt is important to highlight that none are involved in maintaining or operating voting infrastructure and there was no identified impact on election systems,\u201d Krebs said.  The Biden and Trump campaigns both said they were aware of the targeting and weren\u2019t surprised by it.  Russian Embassy Press Secretary Nikolay Lakhonin pushed back on the allegations, saying Americans had been discussing \u201cso-called \u2018interference\u2019\u201d for years without presenting what he described as \u201cfactual evidence.\u201d Alireza Miryousefi, spokesman for Iran\u2019s U.N. mission in New York, said it was \u201cpreposterous to even think that Iran would conduct hacking.\u201d  China\u2019s foreign affair ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said that China has no interest in the U.S. election and has never interfered in it.

Sony\u2019s deal with Microsoft comes at a time when the Japanese firm\u2019s gaming business is losing some steam as its PlayStation 4 (PS4) console nears the end of its life.  Analysts widely expect Sony to launch a next-generation console in 2020 to replace the five-year old PS4, but for this year at least Sony has flagged a drop in profit.  For Microsoft, the deal bolsters its Azure cloud computing business, which helped push its market value past $1 trillion last month.

Slack in May said that Slack is used by 70,000 paying organizations.  Slack, Microsoft and companies including Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Cisco Systems Inc, Facebook Inc and Atlassian Corp PLC have launched products in the fast-growing workplace collaboration market.

Allen remained loyal to the Pacific Northwest region, directing more than $1 billion to mostly local philanthropic projects, developing Seattle\u2019s South Lake Union tech hub that Amazon.com Inc calls home and building the headquarters of his Allen Institute for Brain Science there.  Gates described Allen as following the Microsoft partnership with a \u201csecond act\u201d focused on strengthening communities and in a statement said, \u201cI am heartbroken by the passing of one of my oldest and dearest friends.\u201d  Current Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella on Monday called him a \u201cquiet and persistent\u201d man who changed the world.  \u201cHe is under-appreciated in Seattle,\u201d said David Brewster, founder of local news website Crosscut.com and the Seattle Weekly newspaper. \u201cHe\u2019s remote and reclusive. There\u2019s too much Howard Hughes in the way he behaves for Seattle truly to appreciate a lot of the good that he does.\u201d  Paul Gardner Allen was born in Seattle on Jan. 21, 1953, the son of a librarian father and teacher mother. He was two years older than Gates but when they met in the computer room at the exclusive Lakeside School in Seattle in 1968, they discovered a shared passion.  \u201cIn those days we were just goofing around, or so we thought,\u201d Gates recalled in his 1995 book \u201c\u0093The Road Ahead.\u201d  FROM BOSTON TO ALBUQUERQUE  Allen went on to Washington State University but dropped out in 1974 to take a job with Honeywell in Boston. While there, he pestered Gates, who was studying at nearby Harvard, to quit school and join the nascent revolution in personal computing.  Gates finally agreed and in 1975 the two jointly developed BASIC software for the Altair 8800, a clunky desktop computer that cost $400 in kit form.  The pair moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, close to the Altair\u2019s maker, and formed a company. It was Allen\u2019s idea to call it Micro-Soft, an amalgam of microcomputer and software. The hyphen was later dropped.  Allen was in charge of Microsoft\u2019s technical operations for the company\u2019s first eight years, making him one of the handful of people who created early software such as MS-DOS and Word that enabled the PC revolution and thrust Microsoft to the top.  But he had ceased to be on the cutting edge of software development by the early 1980s. He never displayed the commercial instinct of Gates, who generally is credited with powering Microsoft\u2019s rise to ubiquity in the 1990s.  Allen left Microsoft in 1983 after falling out with Gates and his new lieutenant, Steve Ballmer, in December 1982, only months after being diagnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. As he recalled in his 2011 memoir \u201cIdea Man,\u201d he overheard Gates and Ballmer secretly plotting to reduce his ownership stake.  \u201cThey were bemoaning my recent lack of production and discussing how they might dilute my Microsoft equity by issuing options to themselves and other shareholders,\u201d Allen wrote.  Gates and Ballmer later apologized but the damage was done and Allen left Microsoft, although he remained on the board until 2000.  CANCER BATTLES  Allen recovered from his cancer after radiation treatment but in 2009 was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, another form of blood cancer. He went into remission in April 2010 but the disease resurfaced in 2018.  Allen held onto his share of the company. His 28 percent stake at Microsoft\u2019s initial public offering in 1986 instantly made him a multi-millionaire.  His wealth peaked at about $30 billion in late 1999, according to Forbes magazine, but Allen was hurt by the sharp decline in Microsoft stock after the dot.com bubble burst in 2000 and some unprofitable technology investments.  In October 2018, Forbes magazine estimated his wealth at $21.7 billion and said he was the 44th richest person in the world.  Allen, the owner of 42 U.S. patents, liked to cast himself as a technology visionary who drove Microsoft\u2019s early success and saw the future of connected computing long before the Internet.  \u201cI expect the personal computer to become the kind of thing that people carry with them, a companion that takes notes, does accounting, gives reminders, handles a thousand personal tasks,\u201d Allen wrote in a column in Personal Computing magazine as far back as 1977, long before portable computers became a reality.  In the same year, he outlined an early vision of what turned out to be the Internet to Microcomputer Interface magazine.  \u201cWhat I do see is a home terminal that\u2019s connected to a centralized network by phone lines, fiber optics or some other communication system,\u201d he said. \u201cWith that system you can perhaps put your car up for sale or look for a house in a different city or check out the price of asparagus at the nearest grocery market or check the price of a stock.\u201d  Allen later called this sweeping idea the \u201cwired world,\u201d which has broadly come to fruition. He was not alone in predicting connected computing but was one of the most prominent.  Yet Allen\u2019s technology ventures after Microsoft, which focused on areas he thought would grow with the advent of the \u201cwired world,\u201d were not as successful. He lost $8 billion in the cable television industry, chiefly with a bad bet on cable company Charter Communications, while technology ventures he bankrolled such as Metricom, SkyPix and Interval Research were costly failures.  SPORTS TEAMS, A YACHT AND HENDRIX  He had better luck in sports and real estate. Allen bought the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team in 1988 and became a local hero in 1997 when he purchased the Seattle Seahawks football franchise after the previous owner had tried to move the team to California. The Seahawks won the Super Bowl in February 2014 and both franchises are now valued at many times what Allen paid for them.  Allen also made hundreds of millions of dollars redeveloping South Lake Union, a shabby area of downtown Seattle that became a gleaming technology Mecca and site of Amazon.com\u2019s glass \u201cspheres\u201d headquarters.  All the while, the never-married Allen pursued myriad personal projects and pastimes. He owned one of the world\u2019s biggest yachts, the 400-foot (122 meters) Octopus, which was the venue for many lavish parties and the base for scuba expeditions.  A rock \u2018n\u2019 roll aficionado, Allen had a band on call to jam with when he wanted, and spent more than $250 million building a museum devoted to his hero, Jimi Hendrix, which morphed into a music and science fiction exhibit designed by Frank Gehry.  He spent millions more on a collection of vintage warplanes and funded the first non-government rocket to make it into space. He also collected priceless antiquities and works by Monet, Rodin and Rothko to put in his extensive art collection.  Like Gates, Allen was a dedicated philanthropist, giving away more than $1.5 billion in his lifetime and pledging to donate more than half his wealth to charity.  Through various vehicles, Allen focused his giving on brain science, motivated by the loss of his mother to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, along with universities and libraries.

REUTERS\/ Mike Blake  (Reuters) - When Microsoft Corp reports earnings on Wednesday, analysts expect some areas of its business to take a hit from the novel coronavirus pandemic, with lower-than-expected sales in areas like advertising on its LinkedIn social network.  But analysts also expect a surge in the use of Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing services and collaboration tools such as the Teams app \u201cas more companies are effectively forced into the cloud\u201d by stay-home orders, as Macquarie Capital analysts Sarah Hindlian-Bowler and Calvin Patel wrote in a research note. Analysts expect those upticks to offset some of declines and position Microsoft as well or better than its peers as the full economic impact of the pandemic becomes clearer.  Analysts expect Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, to report $33.63 billion in revenue and earnings of $1.27 per share for its fiscal third quarter, up from $30.5 billion and $1.14 per share the year before, according to IBES data from Refinitiv as of April 27. The biggest drivers will remain Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud computing platform, which competes with Amazon.com\u2019s Amazon Web Services, and its online software for businesses.  \u201cI don\u2019t think that narrative will take a long-term hit,\u201d Alex Zukin, managing director for software equity research at RBC Capital Markets, said in an interview. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing investors more than willing to give a pass to short-term pockets of weakness around certain businesses.\u201d  The Teams app, in particular, has benefited from stay-home orders in many countries, hitting 44 million users last month. While much of the surge was related to the novel coronavirus and could fade as workers return to offices, Macquarie\u2019s Hindlian-Bowler and Patel expect Teams adoption to be permanently higher than it would have been.  In other segments, analysts expect revenues to be weaker than previously anticipated, including the paid use of LinkedIn by job recruiters, software tools designed for computer servers that sit in a company\u2019s own data centers and even sales of Windows for personal computers, which were interrupted as factories in China shut down during the first three months of the calendar year.  Some of those revenue streams could spring back. After hitting supply shortages, for example, laptop orders have rebounded as companies and consumers bought machines to work from home, an impact that could show in Microsoft\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings report.  Sales in other units more reliant on large one-time deals like on-premises server software could be depressed for months as businesses put non-essential spending on the back burner. But much of Microsoft\u2019s revenue has shifted to subscription or consumption-based billing, which should soften the effect.  \u201cThe revenue stream for Microsoft is extremely sticky,\u201d Zukin said.","377":"July 20 (Reuters) - Shares of Microsoft Corp were set to open at a record high on Friday, after the company reported another blockbuster quarter, backed by growth in its legacy software business and Azure cloud computing services.

At least six brokerages raised their price targets on the company\u2019s stock after the results.  Helped by a boom in demand for cloud-based software, Microsoft has more than doubled in value since Satya Nadella took over as chief executive in 2014 and refocused the software behemoth on newer businesses.  While Microsoft\u2019s core productivity and business processes unit, which includes the Office 365 software suite, rose 13.1 percent to $9.67 billion, revenue for the Azure cloud service jumped 89 percent.  \u201cBased on the results, they were able to beat on all major metrics that people were focusing on.

Trump has given Microsoft until Sept. 15 to put together a blueprint for an acquisition that safeguards the personal data of Americans stored on the short-video app, and he has issued an order to ban it if there is no deal by then.  Microsoft is negotiating a transition period that will give it time to ringfence TikTok technologically from ByteDance after they agree to a deal, Reuters reported on Aug. 2.  The clean break that Trump and lawmakers envision could take a year or more, some of the sources said.  TikTok is functionally and technically similar to ByteDance-owned Douyin, which is available only in China, and shares technical resources with it and other ByteDance-owned properties, people familiar with the matter said.  ByteDance started working on their technological separation several months ago amid scrutiny from the U.S. government, a source familiar with the process told Reuters. It began planning for a split as part of a strategy to shift its power from China, Reuters has reported.  While the code for the app, which determines the look and feel of TikTok, has been separated from Douyin, the server code is still partially shared across other ByteDance products, the source said. The server code provides basic functionality of the apps such as data storage, algorithms for moderating and recommending content and the management of user profiles.  To ensure uninterrupted TikTok service, Microsoft would likely need to rely on ByteDance\u2019s code while it reviews and revises the code, and moves to a new back-end infrastructure to serve users, according to cyber security expert Ryan Speers at River Loop Security, which provides services including cybersecurity due diligence for deals.  Any continuing technical or operational reliance of the U.S. business on the Chinese company after the sale generally would have been unacceptable to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), said Aimen Mir, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury responsible for CFIUS, now a partner at the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  In the past, CFIUS has required adoption of increased protections pending a sale, including separation of the U.S. business from foreign sellers to the furthest extent possible, he said.  Another challenge Microsoft faces is how it will transfer what is viewed as TikTok\u2019s secret sauce, the recommendation engine that keeps users glued to their screens. This engine, or algorithm, powers TikTok\u2019s \u201cFor You\u201d page, which recommends the next video to watch based on an analysis of user behavior.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  TikTok uses recommendation algorithms that are independent from Douyin, according to two sources familiar with the matter. But what makes it tick is the content and user information that is fed into the algorithm.  \u201cAlgorithms are not worth anything without the data,\u201d said Jim DuBois, a former Chief Information Officer at Microsoft. DuBois is a venture adviser at Ignition Partners. \u201cSegmenting the data for those countries is a significant task.\u201d  Microsoft\u2019s negotiations for the acquisition of the U.S., Canada, New Zealand and Australia operations of TikTok complicates a separation. Not only would TikTok have to be separated from ByteDance, it would have to be broken up from TikTok\u2019s other regions. This adds to the technical challenges because of the amount of data involved.  \u201cThe biggest part is separating the user data - both content and data about users,\u201d DuBois said, noting hard disks of data would likely need to be transferred between ByteDance and Microsoft.  TikTok had said its user data was stored in the U.S., with a backup in Singapore, separate from the rest of the company.  The proposed timeline makes consummating a deal very challenging, said Karen C. Hermann, a deal lawyer at Venable LLP: \u201cIt can sometimes take months and months just to identify the business needs of the divested business, what IP and other assets it uses exclusively, and what assets and IP it shares with other businesses in the company group.\u201d","379":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd\u2019s shares rose 4 percent in early trading on Tuesday after the company said it would provide security for one-time rival Microsoft Corp\u2019s flagship Office apps.

BlackBerry and Microsoft were bitter rivals until both decided to focus their businesses elsewhere after losing out in the fiercely competitive smartphone market.  Microsoft has concentrated on cloud computing, while BlackBerry has moved away from selling its own phones to providing software and security to others\u2019 devices.

Upbeat earnings from Microsoft and Mercedes maker Daimler, along with a ceasefire in northern Syria had also lifted the mood, though trade and Brexit uncertainties and some below-par German data prevented more sizable gains.  The list of landmarks was nevertheless still impressive. The pan-European Stoxx 600 rose 0.3% to its highest since May 2018. Germany\u2019s DAX wasn\u2019t far behind and the euro, although a shade lower, was consolidating its 2.1% October advance at $1.1130..

ELECTRIC DREAMS  On Wall Street third-quarter earnings reports remained center stage with investors trying to gauge the fallout from a prolonged U.S.-China trade war, which has already shown up in the domestic economy.  On Wednesday, the Dow and the Nasdaq added 0.2% each and the S&P 500 gained 0.3%. Tesla shares jumped 21% in after-hours trading after the company reported an unexpected third-quarter profit.  Microsoft was looking good too after posting forecast-beating profit and revenue numbers after the closing bell, although the outlook was darkened by slower-than-expected take-up of its Azure cloud services.  Shares of Boeing Co and Caterpillar Inc meanwhile had ended about 1% higher each despite big earnings misses.  \u201cWe have been down this road before with CAT,\u201d RBC Capital Markets\u2019 chief economist Tom Porcelli said in a note titled Still Waiting For Recession. \u201cIf you keep saying a recession is here, it is a mathematical certainty that at some point you will be right.

The dollar index was lower at 97.452 against a basket of six major currencies, heading for its worst month since January 2018.  In commodity markets, oil steadied above $61 a barrel on as concern over the demand outlook offset a surprise drop in U.S. crude inventories and the prospect of further action by OPEC and its allies to support the market.  Brent crude was unchanged at $61.17 a barrel, having jumped 2.5% on Wednesday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down 10 cents at $55.87 and gold barely budged at $1,491.50 an ounce.","391":"FILE PHOTO: A bird flies in front of the Cd Projekt logo at its headquarters in Warsaw, Poland January 21, 2020.

Amazon will be the sole tenant in a new, modern eight-story office building that\u2019s nearing completion in the South African city, multiple sources familiar with the project told Reuters. The company is advertising dozens of jobs in Cape Town, which played a key role in the early development of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-computing business.  The adverts include one for a software development engineer that says Amazon is assembling a team for a \u201cgreen-field project\u201d dealing with machine learning, big data analysis and cloud computing, which are among the fastest-growing areas in the technology industry.  The company\u2019s expansion shows how fierce competition in the cloud business and rising demand for computing power are driving activity even in relatively undeveloped corners of the technology universe.  AWS is the global leader in cloud computing with 32 percent of the market, versus 16 percent for second-placed Microsoft in the first quarter of 2018, according to research firm Canalys. Microsoft has been growing faster.  The global cloud infrastructure services market was worth nearly $55 billion in 2017 and is expected to exceed $155 billion by 2020, Canalys said. AWS accounted for 73 percent of Amazon\u2019s $1.9 billion operating profit in the first quarter, but just 11 percent of its revenue.  Amazon\u2019s new Cape Town building is due for completion in August, according to a source familiar with the matter. It sits near an existing Amazon technical centre and customer support operation.  Amazon did not offer details about the new building in Cape Town, or what its function might be.  \u201cAs more South African customers and partners continue to choose AWS as their cloud provider we continue to hire more staff into our offices in Cape Town and Johannesburg,\u201d Geoff Brown, AWS\u2019 Sub-Saharan Africa regional manager, told Reuters in a statement.  In another sign of Amazon\u2019s cloud-computing drive in South Africa, it is offering start-ups free cloud trials for one year, according to local entrepreneur Tumi Menyatswe - a deal that prompted her to switch to AWS from Google\u2019s cloud.  \u201cThis allows me to focus on my business and to grow until I can pay them,\u201d said Menyatswe, CEO of two-year-old business Minderz, which pairs pet owners with people able to look after cats and dogs during holidays.  EDGE IN AFRICA  It is difficult to measure the relative success of the big cloud-computing players in Africa, as they do not break out financial results for the continent. However, according to analysts, data centres are one measure of growth.  Despite its history on the continent, Amazon has yet to build a data centre in Africa. Microsoft, by contrast, announced last year that it was building two data centres in South Africa, one in Cape Town and one in Johannesburg, both due to launch later this year.  Microsoft said in a statement that the plans were on track but would not specify when the data centres would be launched in 2018.  Local data centres offer advantages, in part by reducing \u201clatency\u201d, or delays, in data transmission. \u201cCloser is almost always better,\u201d said Carl Brooks, an analyst at 451 Research.  Clifford De Wit, former chief innovation officer at Microsoft South Africa, said a local data centre was a big advantage.  \u201cHaving the actual data centre close has so many implications,\u201d said De Wit, now chief technology officer at start-up Dexterity Digital. He cited privacy regulations that require banks and some other companies to store data locally, among other benefits.  Amazon\u2019s Brown told Reuters that South Africa was \u201cone of the many possibilities that we are currently looking at\u201d globally for opening a new data centre.  He said the company launched new \u201cEdge\u201d locations -infrastructure that boosts transmission speeds from primary data centres outside the continent - in Johannesburg and Cape Town in the past two months. This will reduce latency for South African customers and bring other benefits, he said.  Famous for its Table Mountain and sandy beaches, Cape Town is emerging as a continental tech hub, with some 35,000 people employed in the sector, according to Wesgro, a trade and investment agency. The city boasts one of the largest publicly available fibre optic networks in Africa, local economic development officials say.  Amazon has played a key role in the city\u2019s internet industry from the start. Two South Africans, Chris Pinkham and Willem van Biljon, led a small Cape Town-based team that developed the key technical underpinnings of AWS, a software architecture known as EC2, and helped build the business plan for the service.  \u201cWe knew it was going to have a large impact,\u201d Van Biljon, who left Amazon more than a decade ago and still lives in Cape Town, told Reuters. \u201cThe rate at which the growth occurred outstripped even our best expectations.\u201d (Additional reporting by Jeffrey Dastin and Sal Rodriguez in San Francisco; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Pravin Char)","400":"HONG KONG, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Some mainland China internet users said they were able to use Microsoft Corp\u2019s Bing search engine late Thursday after the site had been blocked.

The attempted intrusions, many of which were internally flagged by Microsoft Corp over the summer, were carried out by a group often nicknamed \u201cFancy Bear.\u201d The hackers\u2019 activity provides insight into how Russian intelligence is targeting the United States in the run-up to the Nov. 3 election.  The targets identified by Reuters, which include the Center for American Progress, the Council on Foreign Relations and the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said they had not seen any evidence of successful hacking attempts.  Fancy Bear is controlled by Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency and was responsible for hacking the email accounts of Hillary Clinton\u2019s staff in the run-up to the 2016 election, according to a Department of Justice indictment filed in 2018.  News of the Russian hacking activity follows last month's announcement here by Microsoft that Fancy Bear had attempted to hack more than 200 organizations, many of which the software company said were tied to the 2020 election. Microsoft was able to link this year's cyber espionage campaign to the Russian hackers through an apparent programming error that allowed the company to identify a pattern of attack unique to Fancy Bear, according to a Microsoft assessment reviewed by Reuters.  Microsoft declined to comment on Reuters\u2019 findings.  The thrust of espionage operations could not be determined by Reuters. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in August here that Russian operations were attempting to undermine the campaign of presidential candidate Joe Biden.  Democratic National Committee spokesman Chris Meagher said it was \u201cno surprise\u201d that foreign actors were attempting to interfere with the election.  The Russian Embassy in Washington said it does not interfere in America\u2019s internal affairs and denied any link to \u201cFancy Bear,\u201d calling the allegation \u201cfake news.\u201d  The Trump campaign did not return messages.  Over the summer, a specialized cybersecurity unit at Microsoft and federal law enforcement agents notified many of the targets who were in Fancy Bear\u2019s crosshairs, according to six people with knowledge of the matter. Reuters identified SKDKnickerbocker, a lobbying firm allied with Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, as one of them last month.  The targeting of Democrats in Indiana and California - confirmed by four people familiar with the matter - suggests that the Russians are \u201ccasting their net wide,\u201d said Don Smith of cybersecurity company Secureworks.  The Indiana Democratic Party said in a statement it was \u201cunaware of any successful intrusions.\u201d California Democratic Party Chair Rusty Hicks acknowledged being targeted, but stopped short of naming Fancy Bear, saying in an email that \u201cthe effort by the foreign entity was unsuccessful.\u201d  The FBI declined comment.  ATTACKS ON INFLUENTIAL NON-PROFITS  Fancy Bear also targeted think tanks and foreign policy organizations that hold sway in Washington and have, in the past, provided staff for presidential administrations.  Among them was the Center for American Progress (CAP), a left-leaning group whose founder, John Podesta, was at the center of the 2016 Russian hack and leak operation, according to a person with direct knowledge of the incident.  A CAP spokesperson said the organization had not been breached and declined further comment.  The Open Society Foundations, one of the first organizations to see its correspondence leaked to the public by Fancy Bear in 2016, was targeted by the Kremlin again earlier this year, according to two people briefed on the matter. The group\u2019s founder, George Soros, has provided substantial funding to pro-democracy causes and is a regular target of Russian disinformation as well as domestic conspiracy theories.  In a statement, the Open Society said \u201cobviously tensions are extraordinarily high heading into this election, and we are taking many steps to ensure the safety of our staff.\u201d  Others targeted by Fancy Bear in 2020 included the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment, and the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) - all of whom were notified by Microsoft, according to people familiar with the respective organizations.  A CSIS spokesman declined comment on the hacking activity. A Carnegie spokeswoman confirmed the targeting, but declined to provide further detail.

Bezos also owns the Washington Post, whose coverage has been critical of Trump.  Along with Trump and Esper, Amazon seeks to depose former Defense Secretary James Mattis, Pentagon chief information officer Dana Deasy and four other procurement officials, court records show.  An Amazon spokesperson said that \u201cPresident Trump has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness to use his position as President and Commander in Chief to interfere with government functions \u2013 including federal procurements \u2013 to advance his personal agenda.  \u201cThe question is whether the President of the United States should be allowed to use the budget of the DoD to pursue his own personal and political ends,\u201d the spokesperson added.  The lawsuit also says Amazon\u2019s protest against the decision occurs against the background of impeachment, \u201cwhich is grounded in the President\u2019s repeated refusal to separate his personal interests from the national interest.\u201d President Trump has been acquitted on impeachment charges by the Republican-controlled Senate.  The lawsuit also mentions other instances of alleged interference from Trump.  For example, his alleged interference in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 award of a $400 million border wall contract to Fisher Industries in December 2019 and a report that Trump intervened in the General Services Administration\u2019s solicitation of bids to move the FBI\u2019s headquarters to a new campus in the suburbs.  The current FBI offices are near a Washington hotel owned by Trump\u2019s company.  The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House declined to comment.  Last month, Amazon filed a motion in court to delay the Department of Defense deal with Microsoft until a court rules on its protest of the contract award.  The procurement process has been delayed by legal complaints and conflict of interest allegations. Esper has denied there was bias and said the Pentagon made its choice fairly and freely without external influence.","405":"STOCKHOLM\/TOKYO, (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp MSFT.O on Tuesday launched two models of its Xbox gaming console, seven years after the debut of the previous version, to capture a pandemic-driven boom in consumer spending on games.

PS5 is widely viewed as leading the console race due to its bigger fan base and a broader range of exclusive gaming titles available at launch.  This was the first time Microsoft launched its gaming console globally on the same day and the company said it has seen the highest preorders for Xbox consoles across various markets.  While the initial supply of preorders sold out fast, Microsoft had said additional stocks would be available at launch.  \u201cThere were some early supply chain issues in Q1\/Q2 due to Chinese manufacturing plants shutting down due to COVID, but these have since been operating normally again,\u201d said analyst Maurice Klaehne at research firm Counterpoint.

Jefferies analysts have also pointed to reports of refunds offered by both Sony and Microsoft for digital purchases of the game.  The company said it would hold a call with analysts at 2 p.m. (1300 GMT) and offered no further comment.  Kacper Kopron, analyst at TRIGON DM brokerage, estimates sales of the game\u2019s version on older consoles could account for one-third of its total expected sales volumes over the game\u2019s life cycle.  CD Projekt should now focus on repairing its communication with the gamers, Kopron added.

REUTERS\/David Gray  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Two of America\u2019s fabled technology giants have traded places, with Tim Cook\u2019s Apple playing tortoise to the hare that is Satya Nadella\u2019s Microsoft. This new drama could be on for an extended run.  Apple on Tuesday reported that revenue in the three months to the end of June 29 rose 1% year-over-year to $54 billion. Sales of the company\u2019s iconic iPhone dropped 12%. Service revenue, the money Apple collects from licensing and sales on its app store, grew 13% percent. It\u2019s a bright spot but not enough to offset the bigger drag given it represents only a fifth of the overall pie. The results exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates, and Apple\u2019s stock rose more than 3% in after-hours trading.  Yet compared to its Redmond, Washington rival, Apple looks like a laggard. Earlier in July, Microsoft said its revenue for the same quarter rose 12% to $34 billion as more businesses used its Azure cloud service and subscriptions for its suite of Office products rose.  Microsoft has also overtaken Apple in market worth. A 39% rise in its stock price this year has made it the world\u2019s most-valuable listed company at nearly $1.1 trillion. Add in dividends and Nadella\u2019s company has delivered shareholders a total return of 36% over the past 12 months, three times Apple\u2019s. It has beat Apple on that metric over the past five years, too.  The rivalry between the two tech giants goes back decades. Under founder Bill Gates, Microsoft was so dominant in personal computing operating systems that U.S. regulators tried to break it up. He prevailed but paid a price as Microsoft missed the mobile revolution. A string of costly, questionable acquisitions followed, including $10 billion for Nokia and $6 billion for digital-advertising agency aQuantive.  Cook hasn\u2019t shown signs of retracing Microsoft\u2019s past missteps. Even though Apple is sitting on $102 billion in cash, it rarely makes acquisitions. When it does, like last week\u2019s $1 billion purchase of Intel\u2019s smartphone modem business or a potential investment in SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund 2, they\u2019re small. Apple is more likely to continue with a slow methodical approach. That could leave it in Microsoft\u2019s shadow for some time to come.","413":"BEIJING (Reuters) - A former manager for Microsoft Corp in China has been named as the first executive secretary of the Responsible Cobalt Initiative (RCI), which works to address social and environmental risks in the cobalt supply chain.  Christina Feng, who managed the U.S. tech giant\u2019s program for the responsible sourcing of raw materials until January 2017, was appointed to the full-time RCI role earlier this month and will be based in Beijing, Feng said in an interview with Reuters late on Wednesday.  The 28-member RCI, which groups high-profile cobalt users such as Apple Inc, Sony Corp and Volvo, was established under the Chinese Chamber of Commerce for Metals, Minerals & Chemicals Importers and Exporters (CCCMC) in 2016.  It is currently in the process of selecting a premises for its secretariat in the Chinese capital.  Cobalt, a metal used in lithium-ion batteries for mobile phones and electric vehicles (EVs), has shot to prominence in recent months and its price has skyrocketed due to expected growth in demand from the booming EV sector, especially in China.  But Amnesty International has warned of human rights abuses, including child labor, linked to cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which produces more than 60 percent of the world\u2019s cobalt.  \u201cI consider my role as being responsible for the operations of the secretariat, defining the strategy of the RCI and developing work plans in consultation with board members and other member companies,\u201d Feng told Reuters.  \u201cI think right now the priority is to really define our strategy\u201d for at least the next three years after a long formalization process, she added.  The RCI is currently chaired by the CCCMC, with China\u2019s Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Co Ltd and Germany\u2019s BMW as vice chairs.  Feng said she has never been to the DRC but is planning a visit. The child labor issue is \u201con the top of our radar\u201d but a \u201ccomplicated issue in the DRC context,\u201d she added.  The RCI intends to hold an open session for cobalt market participants at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, a key backer of the RCI, in Paris in mid-April, said Feng.","414":"(Adds ConocoPhillips, Enel; updates Microsoft, Anatol)  June 4 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 2000 GMT on Monday:  ** ConocoPhillips is preparing to offload its stake in Cenovus Energy Inc that it acquired as part of an asset sale to the Canadian oil and gas producer last year, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.  ** Microsoft Corp said it would buy privately held coding website GitHub Inc for $7.5 billion in an all-stock deal to beef up its cloud computing business and challenge market leader Amazon.com Inc.  ** Italy\u2019s Enel SpA bought 73 percent of the shares of Brazilian power company Eletropaulo in an offer at local exchange B3 , paying around 5.55 billion reais ($1.48 billion.  ** Discovery Inc, the owner of Animal Planet and the Discovery Channel, said it will invest more than $2 billion over the next decade to broadcast and stream golf\u2019s PGA Tour outside the United States.  ** Walmart Inc said that private equity firm Advent International will pick up an 80 percent stake in Walmart Brazil and the retailer will retain the remaining 20 percent, without disclosing the value of the transaction.  ** Richemont has completed the sale of its struggling French leather bag maker Lancel to Italian high-end briefcase maker Piquadro in a profit share deal, the luxury goods maker said.  ** Germany\u2019s Bayer will wrap up the $63 billion takeover of Monsanto on Thursday and also retire the U.S. seeds maker\u2019s 117 year-old name.  ** AccorHotels is looking at taking a minority stake in troubled airline Air France KLM to compete better with the broader travel packages offered by online rivals such as Expedia and Booking.com.  ** Nomad Foods said it would buy British frozen foods maker Aunt Bessie\u2019s from William Jackson & Son Ltd for 240 million euros ($281.33 million).  ** Scandinavian payments group Nets is planning to merge with German peer Concardis in a roughly $6 billion transaction, adding to a string of deals in the rapidly consolidating industry.  ** Israel\u2019s Enlight Renewable Energy said on Sunday it is in talks to buy a 300 megawatt wind energy project in western Europe.  ** UK-based packaging group DS Smith Plc has offered to buy Spanish rival Europac for 1.9 billion euros ($2.2 billion) including debt to bolster its position in western Europe\u2019s fast-growing packaging market.  ** Planemaker Boeing Co and French aerospace firm Safran SA will join forces to make and service auxiliary power units (APUs), used to start aircraft engines and run other aircraft systems.  ** eBay Inc could end up with a stake of up to 5 percent in Adyen as part of a deal the two companies agreed in January that will see the Dutch fintech company become eBay\u2019s primary payment processor, a Dutch newspaper reported.  ** Italy\u2019s third largest bank, Banco BPM, is looking to sell part of its debt servicing unit as it strives to meet its bad-loan reduction goals two years ahead of time, sources familiar with the matter said.  ** Shareholders of Slovenian shipping firm Intereuropa on Monday announced a tender for expressions of interest in buying 72.13 percent of the company, financial consultancy PwC said.  ** Luxembourg\u2019s Anatol S.a.r.l. plans to lauch a takeover bid for all of Slovenia\u2019s metal products maker Cinkarna Celje , Nova Ljubljanska Banka, which is leading the process, said.  ** Shares in lender CYBG rose 3 percent on Monday after it announced a revised bid for rival Virgin Money, increasing the likelihood of a deal that would create a new competitor to Britain\u2019s biggest banks.  ** Britain\u2019s Rolls-Royce said it had completed the sale of Germany-based diesel parts maker L\u2019Orange to U.S.-based engineering company Woodward Inc with net proceeds totalling 673 million euros.  ** Italy\u2019s biggest bank, UniCredit SpA is exploring a merger with France\u2019s Societe Generale SA in a move that would see the European banks leading the way for banking mergers on the continent, the FT said on Sunday.  ** UK-based packaging group DS Smith Plc offered to buy Europac, valuing its Spanish rival at 1.9 billion euros ($2.2 billion) as it looks to strengthen its business in western Europe in what would be its biggest-ever acquisition.

FILE PHOTO: The Microsoft sign is shown on top of the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 19,2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  The Redmond, Washington-based company beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit and revenue, powered by an unexpected boost in Windows revenue and brisk growth in its cloud business which has reached tens of billions of dollars in sales.  Microsoft shares rose 4.4% to $130.54 in late trading after the forecast issued on a conference call with investors, pushing the company ahead of Apple Inc\u2019s $980 billion market capitalization. The companies and Amazon.com Inc have taken turns in recent months to rank as the world\u2019s most valuable U.S.-listed company.  Microsoft\u2019s stock has gained about 23% gain so far this year, after hitting a record high of $125.85 during regular trading hours.  Under Chief Executive Satya Nadella, the company has spent the past five years shifting from reliance on its once-dominant Windows operating system to selling cloud-based services.  Azure, Microsoft\u2019s flagship cloud product, competes with market leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide computing power to businesses.  Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood told investors that Microsoft expects to see growth in the fiscal fourth quarter in the business divisions in charge of Azure and Office 365, an online version of its longtime productivity software.  For the third quarter ended March 31, Azure\u2019s growth slowed slightly to 73%, down from 76% in the second quarter. Mike Spencer, Microsoft\u2019s head of investor relations, said the decline was roughly in line with the company\u2019s estimate.  Christopher Eberle, a senior equity analyst with Nomura, said that with Azure, \u201cone should assume a slower rate of growth as we move forward, simply due to the law of large numbers.\u201d Still, Azure will bring in $13.5 billion in sales in fiscal 2019 with an overall growth rate of 75%, he estimated. \u201cI can\u2019t name another company of that scale growing at these rates.\u201d  Microsoft tops tech rivals such as Amazon in market capitalization on some days despite having less revenue, partly because most of its sales go to businesses, which tend to be steadier customers than consumers. A growing proportion of Microsoft\u2019s software sales are billed as recurring subscription purchases, which are more reliable than one-time purchases.  Microsoft\u2019s earnings per share of $1.14 beat expectations of $1, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Windows licensing revenue from computer makers grew 9% year over year, beating expectations after a 5% decline in the previous quarter. Spencer said a shortage of Intel Corp processor chips for PCs that many analysts expected to last into this summer had been resolved earlier than expected, allowing PC makers to ship more machines.  Microsoft\u2019s \u201ccommercial cloud\u201d revenue - which includes business use of Azure, Office 365 and LinkedIn - was $9.6 billion this quarter, up 41% from the previous year but down slightly from the 48% growth rate the previous quarter.  Microsoft\u2019s so-called \u201cintelligent cloud\u201d unit, which contains its Azure services, posted revenue of $9.65 billion, above Wall Street estimates of $9.28 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Microsoft\u2019s Hood said that unit could reach $11.05 billion in revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter.  The \u201cproductivity and business process\u201d unit that includes both Office as well as social network LinkedIn had $10.2 billion revenue versus expectations of $10.05 billion. Hood forecast up to $10.75 billion in revenue for the unit for the fourth quarter.  Microsoft\u2019s latest results contained two weak spots.  Its gaming revenue was up only 5% versus 8% the quarter before, which Spencer attributed to less revenue from third-party game developers and the fact that many gamers are delaying purchases of Microsoft\u2019s Xbox console because a new model is expected soon.  Sales of the company\u2019s Surface hardware grew 21% versus 39% the quarter before, also because customers waited for updated hardware they expected to be released soon.  Total revenue rose 14% to $30.57 billion, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $29.84 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Net income rose to $8.81 billion, or $1.15 per share, from $7.42 billion, or 96 cents per share, a year earlier.","416":"April 27 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp:  * MICROSOFT - QTRLY DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WAS $0.95 AND INCREASED 36%  * MICROSOFT - QTRLY REVENUE WAS $26.8 BILLION AND INCREASED 16%  * MICROSOFT - QTRLY REVENUE IN PRODUCTIVITY AND BUSINESS PROCESSES WAS $9.0 BILLION AND INCREASED 17%  * MICROSOFT - QTRLY REVENUE IN INTELLIGENT CLOUD WAS $7.9 BILLION AND INCREASED 17%  * MICROSOFT - QTRLY REVENUE IN MORE PERSONAL COMPUTING WAS $9.9 BILLION AND INCREASED 13% (UP 11% IN CONSTANT CURRENCY)  * MICROSOFT - QTRLY SERVER PRODUCTS AND CLOUD SERVICES REVENUE INCREASED 20%  * MICROSOFT - QTRLY OFFICE COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS AND CLOUD SERVICES REVENUE INCREASED 14%  * MICROSOFT - QTRLY WINDOWS OEM REVENUE INCREASED 4% (UP 4% IN CONSTANT CURRENCY) DRIVEN BY OEM PRO REVENUE GROWTH OF 11%  * MICROSOFT - Q3 EARNINGS PER SHARE VIEW $0.85, REVENUE VIEW $25.77 BILLION -- THOMSON REUTERS I\/B\/E\/S  * MICROSOFT - QTRLY SURFACE REVENUE INCREASED 32% (UP 27% IN CONSTANT CURRENCY)  * MICROSOFT- QTRLY SEARCH ADVERTISING REVENUE EXCLUDING TRAFFIC ACQUISITION COSTS INCREASED 16% (UP 14% IN CONSTANT CURRENCY)  * MICROSOFT - QTRLY WINDOWS COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS AND CLOUD SERVICES REVENUE INCREASED 21% (UP 17% IN CONSTANT CURRENCY)  * MICROSOFT - LINKEDIN REVENUE INCREASED 37% IN QUARTER  * MICROSOFT - QTRLY GAMING REVENUE INCREASED 18% (UP 16% IN CONSTANT CURRENCY) DRIVEN BY XBOX SOFTWARE  * MICROSOFT - QTRLY SERVICES REVENUE GROWTH OF 24% (UP 21% IN CONSTANT CURRENCY) MAINLY FROM THIRD PARTY TITLE STRENGTH Source text : [ID:bit.ly\/2FhcEmZ] Further company coverage:","417":"FILE PHOTO: A logo of IBM is seen at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 28, 2018.

Slack said on Wednesday that it has filed a complaint against Microsoft with the European Commission.  \u201cWhat we asking for is Teams be separated from the Office Suite and sold separately with a fair commercial price tag, so it competes on the merits with our products,\u201d its general counsel David Schellhase told reporters.

FILE PHOTO: A Microsoft logo is seen in Los Angeles, California U.S. November 7, 2017. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  Source code - the underlying set of instructions that run a piece of software or operating system - is typically among a technology company\u2019s most closely guarded secrets and Microsoft has historically been particularly careful about protecting it.  It is not clear how much or what parts of Microsoft\u2019s source code repositories the hackers were able to access, but the disclosure suggests that the hackers who used software company SolarWinds as a springboard to break into sensitive U.S. government networks also had an interest in discovering the inner workings of Microsoft products as well.  Microsoft had already disclosed that like other firms it found malicious versions of SolarWinds\u2019 software inside its network, but the source code disclosure - made in a blog post - is new. After Reuters reported it was breached two weeks ago, Microsoft said it had not \u201cfound any evidence of access to production services.\u201d  Three people briefed on the matter said Microsoft had known for days that the source code had been accessed. A Microsoft spokesman said security employees had been working \u201caround the clock\u201d and that \u201cwhen there is actionable information to share, they have published and shared it.\u201d  The SolarWinds hack is among the most ambitious cyber operations ever disclosed, compromising at least half-a-dozen federal agencies and potentially thousands of companies and other institutions. U.S. and private sector investigators have spent the holidays combing through logs to try to understand whether their data has been stolen or modified.  Modifying source code - which Microsoft said the hackers did not do - could have potentially disastrous consequences given the ubiquity of Microsoft products, which include the Office productivity suite and the Windows operating system. But experts said that even just being able to review the code could offer hackers insight that might help them subvert Microsoft products or services.  \u201cThe source code is the architectural blueprint of how the software is built,\u201d said Andrew Fife of Israel-based Cycode, a source code protection company.  \u201cIf you have the blueprint, it\u2019s far easier to engineer attacks.\u201d  Matt Tait, an independent cybersecurity researcher, agreed that the source code could be used as a roadmap to help hack Microsoft products, but he also cautioned that elements of the company\u2019s source code were already widely shared - for example with foreign governments. He said he doubted that Microsoft had made the common mistake of leaving cryptographic keys or passwords in the code.  \u201cIt\u2019s not going to affect the security of their customers, at least not substantially,\u201d Tait said.  Microsoft noted that it allows broad internal access to its code, and former employees agreed that it is more open than other companies.  In its blog post, Microsoft said it had found no evidence of access \u201cto production services or customer data.\u201d  \u201cThe investigation, which is ongoing, has also found no indications that our systems were used to attack others,\u201d it said.  Reuters reported a week ago that Microsoft-authorized resellers were hacked and their access to productivity programs inside targets leveraged in attempts to read email. Microsoft acknowledged some vendor access was misused but has not said how many resellers or customers may have been breached.  There was no response to requests for comment from the FBI, which is investigating the hacking campaign, or from the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybsersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.  U.S. officials have attributed the SolarWinds hacking campaign to Russia, an allegation the Kremlin denies.  Both Tait and Ronen Slavin, Cycode\u2019s chief technology officer, said a key unanswered question was which source code repositories were accessed. Microsoft has a huge range of products, from widely used Windows to lesser known software such as social networking app Yammer and the design app Sway.  Slavin said he was worried by the possibility that the SolarWinds hackers were poring over Microsoft\u2019s source code as prelude to a much more ambitious offensive.  \u201cTo me the biggest question is, \u2018Was this recon for the next big operation?\u2019\u201d he said.","423":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amazon.com urged a U.S. judge to toss out the Pentagon\u2019s $10 billion JEDI cloud computing contract award after the Defense Department said in September a court-ordered re-evaluation had determined Microsoft Corp\u2019s proposal still represented the best value for the government.  The company\u2019s Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit said in a redacted Oct. 23 court filing unsealed on Tuesday that the award to Microsoft must \u201cbe invalidated because it is the product of systematic bias, bad faith, and undue influence exerted by President Trump to steer the award away from\u201d the company. It called it a \u201cflawed and politically corrupted decision.\u201d  The White House declined to comment, referring questions to the Justice Department. The Pentagon did not immediately comment.  Microsoft said in a statement Tuesday \u201ccareer procurement officials at the DoD decided that given the superior technical advantages and overall value, we continued to offer the best solution.\u201d  It added \u201cit is time we moved on and got this technology in the hands of those who urgently need it: the women and men who protect our nation.\u201d  AWS said in a statement Tuesday that as a result of the Pentagon revision in September \u201cthe pricing differential swung substantially, with AWS now the lowest-priced bid by tens of millions of dollars.\u201d  A judge in February granted Amazon\u2019s request to temporarily halt the deal from moving forward; that remains in place.  The court is considering motions to dismiss Amazon\u2019s amended complaint that have been filed by the government and Microsoft. The motions have not been made public and it is not clear when the judge might rule.  Amazon, which had been seen as a front-runner to win the contract, filed a lawsuit in November 2019 after the contract was awarded to Microsoft. Trump has publicly derided Amazon head Jeff Bezos and repeatedly criticized the company.  Amazon\u2019s new filing said Trump and his administration \u201cintensified a campaign of interference and retribution against those in DoD perceived as disloyal to the president or capable of reaching conclusions at odds with his personal interests.\u201d  The company argued the latest Pentagon review was \u201criddled with errors even more egregious than those that plagued the initial award,\u201d and that the Pentagon \u201cmanipulated its evaluations to a degree that belies any facade of rationality.\u201d  The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud (JEDI) contract could reach as much as $10 billion and is part of a broader digital modernization of the Pentagon.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  The Technology Coalition, which coordinates industry action around child sexual abuse, also said its 18 member companies would establish a \u201cmulti-million\u201d dollar research fund to study patterns of abuse and build technological tools to prevent them.  Multiple governments have seized on child exploitation as a major issue in their fight to ban encryption in consumer technologies, which they argue allows criminals to operate with impunity.  \u201cWe\u2019d love to move beyond just the number of reports that may be out there, to really understanding what those reports mean,\u201d said Antigone Davis, Facebook\u2019s global head of safety.  The coalition, whose companies collectively earn hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue each year, declined to provide more details, including specifics about which metrics would be tracked.  Child welfare advocates say the number of known child sexual abuse images has soared from thousands to tens of millions in recent years, as predators have increasingly used social networks to groom victims and exchange explicit images.  The U.S.-led \u201cFive Eyes\u201d alliance last year threatened to weaken legal protections and called on Facebook to suspend plans to extend end-to-end encryption across its messaging services.  Facebook generated more than 90% of U.S. child sexual abuse reports online last year, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.  U.S. lawmakers introduced the \u201cEARN IT Act,\u201d in March which would require tech companies to follow best practices to \u201cearn\u201d legal immunity from content posted on their platforms.

(Reuters) - The U.S. government\u2019s antitrust suit against Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google on Tuesday could deliver a huge opportunity for Microsoft Corp to increase usage of its Bing search engine, an unexpected epilogue years after it abandoned a long campaign for legal relief.  FILE PHOTO: Silhouettes of mobile users are seen next to a screen projection of Microsoft logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo\/File Photo  From at least 2007 through 2015, Microsoft lobbied lawmakers, funded private lawsuits, commissioned opposition research and academic papers and even ran TV commercials, all with the aim of getting regulators to bar what it viewed as anticompetitive practices by Google.  Codenamed \u201cAppendix A\u201d inside Microsoft, the campaign failed to change Google\u2019s behavior or boost Bing\u2019s market share, according to current and former Microsoft officials involved in the effort. Satya Nadella killed Appendix A by cutting funding and staff when he took over as chief executive in 2015, the sources said.  Yet, the concerns once expressed by Microsoft underlie the Justice Department\u2019s new case.  Google cornered the web search and search ads markets by paying billions of dollars to smartphone makers, wireless carriers and browser makers to promote its search engine and penalizing them for showcasing rivals, the government alleges.  Google denied the claims in the lawsuit and called it \u201cdeeply flawed.\u201d  The complaint quotes a Google executive as saying without the \u201creally important\u201d penalties, Bing could have stolen away the widespread promotion Google enjoyed. Another Google staffer is quoted as noting Google\u2019s promotional deals with browsers are \u201ca good way to keep [a browser] away from Bing.\u201d  About 80% of U.S. web searches go through distribution points that Google now owns or controls, leaving Bing with about 7% of the market as the closest competitor, the lawsuit says.  Though Google said it is prepared to fight the lawsuit for years, the filing of the complaint is likely to motivate its search engine rivals to newly invest in improving their technology and challenging Google\u2019s various restrictions to gain greater distribution, technology and legal experts said.  And if Microsoft\u2019s response to a government antitrust lawsuit twenty years ago is any guide, Google may move more cautiously against rivals while the case plays out.  \u201cMarkets work better when firms know there is a sheriff in town,\u201d said Chris Sagers, law professor at Cleveland State University.  Sridhar Ramaswamy, a former Google executive who now runs Neeva, which is developing a paid, privacy-focused search engine, said that \u201cwe hope the DOJ\u2019s actions will create a more equal playing field for search apps like Neeva that want to create real options for customers.\u201d  Microsoft declined to comment for this story. It has answered questions about Google from investigators in several countries over the last two years, according to public records, but has not been proactively bashing Google, two academics and two attorneys once retained for anti-Google work said.  APPENDIX A  The Appendix A effort dated back to Microsoft\u2019s frustration with Google\u2019s 2007 acquisition of online advertising company DoubleClick for $3.1 billion, or less than what Microsoft had offered, one source said.  Then-CEO Steve Ballmer organized a handful of people to understand Google\u2019s strategy and fight the deal, which regulators approved over Microsoft\u2019s objections.  The codename, according to sources, referred to the section within a paper written by Google\u2019s co-founders in which they said \u201cadvertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.\u201d  Microsoft tried to make a case to regulators and the public that Google hurt consumers by blocking them from alternatives and instead ironically providing low-quality search results because they were packed with ads.  Microsoft funded and managed anti-Google groups including FairSearch and Icomp, bringing on board other Google foes including Expedia Group Inc, Yelp Inc, News Corp and Oracle Corp, sources said.  Microsoft-backed websites, such as SafeCloud.org, promoted articles raising concerns about the security of Google cloud services, one source said. One Microsoft staffer focused on bonding with small business aggrieved by Google, two other sources said, with some of the operations subsisting off Microsoft funding.  Political campaign strategist Mark Penn later joined in 2012 to produce the widely viewed \u201cScroogled\u201d advertising campaign that criticized Google\u2019s privacy practices and its ad-heavy product searches.  But when Nadella took Microsoft\u2019s reins, he expressed concern that fighting the industry darling that was Google had hurt his company\u2019s ability to hire, partner and attract new business, according to sources involved in the discussions. Nadella decommissioned the Appendix A team, cleared the air with Google, and began using Google-owned software to power Microsoft\u2019s internet browser and some mobile devices.  Bing\u2019s ad salespeople are among those inside that have agitated to renew anti-Google lobbying, sources said.  Meanwhile, Oracle and those other Google critics picked up where Microsoft left off, and have focused over the last five years on Google\u2019s control over advertising technology used by publishers - a subject mostly left out of Tuesday\u2019s complaint.  The Justice Department could introduce allegations related to Google\u2019s advertising technology as soon as next month, again benefitting Microsoft, according to sources briefed on the investigation.","426":"STOCKHOLM\/TOKYO, (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp MSFT.O on Tuesday launched two models of its Xbox gaming console, seven years after the debut of the previous version, to capture a pandemic-driven boom in consumer spending on games.

PS5 is widely viewed as leading the console race due to its bigger fan base and a broader range of exclusive gaming titles available at launch.  This was the first time Microsoft launched its gaming console globally on the same day and the company said it has seen the highest preorders for Xbox consoles across various markets.  While the initial supply of preorders sold out fast, Microsoft had said additional stocks would be available at launch.  \u201cThere were some early supply chain issues in Q1\/Q2 due to Chinese manufacturing plants shutting down due to COVID, but these have since been operating normally again,\u201d said analyst Maurice Klaehne at research firm Counterpoint.

However, Xbox is seen as lacking killer launch titles, with the latest \u201cHalo\u201d game in the flagship series pushed back to next year as the pandemic hit development.  \u201cEach studio is facing unique challenges and constraints depending on its particular location, and many of our external development partners around the world are similarly affected,\u201d said Ryan Cameron, director at Xbox, EMEA.

The services are designed to work for titles played on any device - including those with operating systems from Microsoft\u2019s onetime rivals like Apple and Google.  Microsoft competes against Amazon Web Services division to sell those cloud services. But it has been in the console gaming business with its Xbox device since 2001 and had 64 million users for its XBox Live online gaming service. Microsoft also owns titles such as the \u201cHalo,\u201d the sci-fi action franchise for the Xbox and Windows, as well as \u201cMinecraft,\u201d a game that is popular on mobile devices with operating systems from Apple Inc and Google Inc.

Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at IHSMarkit, said Amazon has a lead right now over Microsoft in cloud services for game makers. But Microsoft\u2019s moves on Thursday, many based on its acquisition last year of a company called PlayFab, could help it gain ground.  \u201cMicrosoft intends to be as agnostic as possible \u2013 even supporting other cloud service providers and all platforms \u2013 but you have to think that these tools will end with more companies using Azure as a result,\u201d Harding-Rolls said.  An example of where Microsoft hopes its own gaming experience will pay off is in matching players of equal skill online, said Mark Russinovich, chief technical officer of Azure. The service requires a technology called machine learning, which Microsoft has refined through its Xbox Live service over the years, he said.

Trump has publicly derided Amazon head Jeff Bezos and repeatedly criticized the company.  Judge Patricia Campbell-Smith issued a preliminary injunction but did not release her written opinion. She also ordered Amazon to post $42 million in the event the injunction was issued wrongfully.

FILE PHOTO: E.ON headquarters in Essen, Germany, March 15, 2017. REUTERS\/Thilo Schmuelgen\/File Photo  That\u2019s why it teamed up this week with U.S. tech giant Microsoft to produce a digital dashboard of all the electrical devices in a home, from heating systems to solar panels to battery storage systems to electric cars.  Set to go on sale next year, E.ON\u2019s home energy management system will be one of a range of products on offer from big German utility companies desperate to increase profits from their networks of millions of electricity and gas customers.  Faced with the prospect of flat earnings from just selling power, German utilities are offering products from smoke alarms, electronic door locks, EV charging kits, broadband and even the Amazon Prime delivery service to generate higher returns.  They\u2019re also trying to get as many new customers as possible on board now to build brand loyalty for when complex smart homes become the norm rather than the exception - and need cutting-edge technology to run efficiently.  Since E.ON announced plans in March to merge with rival Innogy, it has stepped up a race with Vattenfall, EnBW and smaller utilities to persuade German customers to switch providers, offering signing bonuses such as iPads, washing machines or hundreds of euros in cash.  \u201cThe value of customers today is different from three to four years ago because customers have become more active,\u201d said Victoria Ossadnik, chief executive of E.ON\u2019s retail division Energie Deutschland.  WAKING UP  A study by consultants McKinsey & Company www.mckinsey.com showed that pre-tax earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) from downstream power activities in the European Union will grow by a third to 20 billion euros in the 10 years to 2025.  But none of the increase will come from classic power supply, said McKinsey's Tiziano Bruno, one of the authors of the study here published in May.  Bruno said the increase will come from a 5 billion euro ($5.9 billion) rise in the value of energy efficiency services to 9 billion - and that\u2019s why utility companies are set on ring-fencing customers now and coming up with new products.  Investors welcome the shift after years of underperformance by utilities when low wholesale power prices led to operational losses and fossil-fuel plants were driven out of the market by renewable energy in Germany\u2019s drive towards low-carbon energy.  \"German utilities have woken up and are working hard to ensure the customer side does not slip through their fingers,\" said Thomas Deser, a fund manager at Union Investment union-investment.com\/home.html which holds 1.4 percent of E.ON's shares.  \u201cIf they manage to combine software, hardware and services, there is a great chance they\u2019ll keep working with the customer.\u201d  E.ON already has 6 million private residential accounts in Germany - besides companies, municipalities and cities - and its drive for new clients helped it add 50,000 in the first six months of 2018.  Once it combines forces with Innogy next year, it will command a customer base of 50 million retail clients across Europe in countries such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden, Italy, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania.  Engaged in a similar offensive, Vattenfall, which has 3.5 million German household power accounts, has added 100,000 power and gas customers so far this year, German chief Tuomo Hatakka told Reuters this month.  EnBW has 5.5 million household customers in Germany.  BRAND LOYALTY  One of the challenges for big utility companies is to ensure they can hang onto new customers to make the cost of acquiring them worthwhile - and to develop brand loyalty for the future.  Germany's Bundesnetzagentur here, the regulator for several sectors including electricity and gas, said 4.6 million people switched power accounts in 2016 while 2.4 million negotiated improved terms with their existing supplier.  Ralf Kurtz, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers www.pwc.com, estimates that power companies will need to keep new clients for at least two years for the exercise to become viable.  The utilities then need to ensure they are the ones offering products that will let people manage their energy supplies in an efficient way - rather than allowing disruptors with experience of consumer data and digital market places to steal the show.  Announcing its deal with Microsoft to create a digital dashboard of electrical devices, E.ON said the market for home management systems in Europe was 40,000 a year, but this could rise to at least 200,000 within three years.  \u201cDigitisation, Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence provide us with new opportunities to offer customers increased efficiency and convenience,\u201d said E.ON board member Karsten Wildberger.  \u2018UTILITY-IN-A-BOX\u2019  State-owned development bank KfW www.kfw.de\/kfw.de-2.html said in a study last month that while only 11 percent of German households use smart energy devices to optimize electricity and heat consumption, 57 percent can imagine using them.  Digital smart meters, which monitor consumption and feed data back to power suppliers, have yet to take off in Germany, unlike other EU countries such as Italy and the United Kingdom.  The expected demand in Germany for more smart energy devices is why the big power companies are scouring the market to snap up promising startups to ensure they stay in the driving seat.  \u201cAn organization that has to involve itself with its daily business is unlikely to simply be able to produce disruptive innovation,\u201d said Uli Huener, head of innovation at EnBW.  It has adopted a three-pronged strategy: it lets employees develop ideas in an internal \u201cincubator\u201d, it has put 100 million euros into the EnBW New Ventures fund to buy minority stakes in startups and it also has set up an internal company builder to help get innovative ideas up and running.  A division of E.ON called :agile said on Wednesday it had chosen six European startups with energy related products for a three-month sponsorship program with a view to starting pilot schemes that could lead to commercial products.  E.ON already cooperates with companies such as tado www.tado.com and Nuki nuki.io\/en offering smart products like thermostats and electronic door locks and last month it also joined EnBW and Berlin's investment bank IBB here in a financing round for startup Lumenaza www.lumenaza.de\/en.  The German software company has developed a system it calls utility-in-a-box that monitors renewable power production, manages groups balancing supply and demand, links renewable producers to customers and organizes billing.  Creating digital marketplaces for renewable energy suppliers from a wind farm to a home is seen as a significant opportunity in Germany where there are already 1.7 million private households with solar panels.  \u201cThe realization that the energy future is green, fragmented and decentralized has now arrived at the highest management level,\u201d said Lumenaza\u2019s managing director Christian Chudoba.","444":"FILE PHOTO - Terry Myerson, Microsoft Executive Vice President of the Windows and Devices Group speaks about Microsoft's Windows 10 \"Creators Update\" at a live Microsoft event in the Manhattan borough of New York City, October 26, 2016.

SAN FRANCISCO, June 5 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is stepping up its hiring of women seeking to rejoin the workforce, following a rash of complaints about sexual harassment and gender discrimination at the world\u2019s largest software company.  Such \u201creturnship\u201d programs, aimed at workers who had paused their careers to raise children or care for loved ones, are gaining popularity in Silicon Valley as technology companies seek to address criticism about its bias toward young male staff.

The program is part of Microsoft\u2019s LEAP diversity initiative, aimed at hiring women and minorities from unconventional backgrounds, such as self-taught coders and graduates of so-called coding boot camps. The camps typically consist of about 40 candidates who sign six- to eight-month contracts with the likelihood of full-time offers upon completion.  The returnship trainees will go to two teams in Vancouver, one related to augmented and virtual reality, the other a video game studio, according to job listings posted by Microsoft.  Microsoft received 238 internal complaints of gender discrimination or sexual harassment from 2010 to 2016, according to court filings made public in March. It was sued in a Seattle federal court in 2015 for systematically denying pay raises or promotions to women. The company has denied these claims.  The company said in March it had dealt with 83 complaints of harassment and 84 complaints of gender discrimination in 2017. The complaints resulted in about 20 employees being fired.

Volkswagen, which owns brands such as Audi and Porsche, is working on both self-driving cars for the future and driver-assistance features such as adaptive cruise control in current vehicles. But the company\u2019s brand had been developing those features independently.  Last year, Volkswagen consolidated some of those development efforts into a subsidiary called Car.Software to better coordinate among the makers, with each company handling its own work around the look and feel of the software while collaborating on core safety functions such as detecting obstacles.  But the various companies inside the group were still using different systems to develop that software, and the deal announced Thursday will put them on a common cloud provider, Dirk Hilgenberg, chief executive of Car.Software, told Reuters in an interview.  The Microsoft deal will also make deploying software updates to add new features to cars - a practice that helped set Tesla Inc apart from many rivals early on - much easier.  Volkswagen in 2018 inked a deal with Microsoft to connect its cars to Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud computing service. The Thursday deal means that the software updates will be developed on the same cloud that will then beam those updates down to the cars.  \u201cOver-the-air updates are paramount,\u201d Hilgenberg said. \u201cThis functionality needs to be there.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  While updates to SolarWinds\u2019 Orion software was previously the only known point of entry, security company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc said Thursday hackers had won access to the vendor that sold it Office licenses and used that to try to read CrowdStrike\u2019s email. It did not specifically identify the hackers as being the ones that compromised SolarWinds, but two people familiar with CrowdStrike\u2019s investigation said they were.  CrowdStrike uses Office programs for word processing but not email. The failed attempt, made months ago, was pointed out to CrowdStrike by Microsoft on Dec. 15.  CrowdStrike, which does not use SolarWinds, said it had found no impact from the intrusion attempt and declined to name the reseller.  \u201cThey got in through the reseller\u2019s access and tried to enable mail \u2018read\u2019 privileges,\u201d one of the people familiar with the investigation told Reuters. \u201cIf it had been using Office 365 for email, it would have been game over.\u201d  Many Microsoft software licenses are sold through third parties, and those companies can have near-constant access to clients\u2019 systems as the customers add products or employees.

Other big companies, including Microsoft and Cisco Systems Inc, said they found tainted SolarWinds software internally but had not found signs that the hackers used it to range widely on their networks.  Until now, Texas-based SolarWinds was the only publicly confirmed channel for the initial break-ins, although officials have been warning for days that the hackers had other ways in.  Reuters reported a week ago that Microsoft products were used in attacks. But federal officials said they had not seen it as an initial vector, and the software giant said its systems were not utilized in the campaign.

At the end of a long, technical blog post on Tuesday, it used one sentence to mention seeing hackers reach Microsoft 365 Cloud \u201cfrom trusted vendor accounts where the attacker had compromised the vendor environment.\u201d  Microsoft requires its vendors to have access to client systems in order to install products and allow new users. But discovering which vendors still have access rights at any given time is so hard that CrowdStrike developed and released an auditing tool to do that.  After a series of other breaches through cloud providers, including a major set of attacks attributed to Chinese government-backed hackers and known as CloudHopper, Microsoft this year imposed new controls on its resellers, including requirements for multifactor authentication.  The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the National Security Agency had no immediate comment.  Also Thursday, SolarWinds released an update to fix the vulnerabilities in its flagship network management software Orion following the discovery of a second set of hackers that had targeted the company\u2019s products. That followed a separate Microsoft blog post on Friday saying that SolarWinds had its software targeted by a second and unrelated group of hackers in addition to those linked to Russia.

On Feb. 13, she issued an order blocking work on the contract pending resolution of Amazon\u2019s court challenge.  Amazon contends the contract was awarded to its rival because of improper influence by President Donald Trump.  The opinion did not mention Trump or address Amazon\u2019s claims of improper influence, but instead focused on how the Pentagon assessed Microsoft\u2019s data storage in one price scenario.  Campbell-Smith wrote Amazon \u201cis likely to succeed on the merits of its argument that the DOD improperly evaluated\u201d a Microsoft price scenario. She added Amazon is likely to show that Microsoft\u2019s scenario was not \u201ctechnically feasible\u201d as the Pentagon assessed.

Campbell-Smith said \u201cin the context of a procurement for cloud computing services, the court considers it quite likely that this failure is material.\u201d  Amazon, which had been seen as a front-runner to win the contract, filed a lawsuit in November just weeks after the contract was awarded to Microsoft.

As part of the lawsuit, Amazon asked the court to halt the execution of the contract, popularly known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, or JEDI. The contract is intended to give the military better access to data and technology from remote locations.  Last month, Amazon\u2019s cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, said it was seeking to depose Trump in its lawsuit and suggested the president was trying \u201cto screw Amazon\u201d over the contract.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Mapbox does not make a mapping app itself. It instead competes against Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google Maps and HERE Technologies, the map firm owned by a group of companies, to provide the underlying maps inside of other apps. Mapbox maps are found in Snap Inc\u2019s messaging app and the Instacart grocery delivery app.  But the Washington, D.C.-founded startup, which has raised about $228 million from Softbank\u2019s Vision Fund, DFJ Growth and others, has been pushing into providing tools for software developers who are making the software for self-driving cars.  \u201cOur main focus has been in making maps for humans,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Eric Gundersen told Reuters in an interview. But maps for self-driving cars are read by the cars\u2019 computers and need more detailed data, he said.  At an event it held for software developers in San Francisco on Wednesday, Mapbox announced a handful of partnerships designed to make its technology more useful for self-driving cars.  One of Mapbox\u2019s products is software that lets either a mobile phone or a car\u2019s computer see the road as the car drives, picking out things like lanes or speed-limit signs. The company said it will weave that software together with an offering from Microsoft.  The combination will let drivers in the car see real-time events like speed limit changes but then split off some of the camera data and send it to Microsoft\u2019s cloud computer service, Azure. Once there, the data can be processed later by powerful servers to help improve the algorithms that help self-driving cars navigate.  Separately, Mapbox is also working with chipmaker ARM to optimize its self-driving vision software so features detected by ARM\u2019s chips can be recognized as lanes, pedestrians and road signs even faster. In one form or another, ARM\u2019s chips power the majority of mobile phones, tablets and other mobile computers that are making their way into cars.  Mapbox is also pairing with Intel\u2019s Mobileye self-driving unit, which the chipmaker purchased last year for $15.3 billion.  Mobileye is building its own detailed database of road features that is stored in the cloud. Mapbox has built software that will live in cars to beam down Mobileye\u2019s data without hogging up mobile data bandwidth. Cars that use the system will get a constant map ahead of about 200 meters (660 ft), providing a key backup to the car\u2019s onboard sensors, the companies said.

The Redmond, Wash.-based software giant is developing systems that track what shoppers add to their carts, the people say. Microsoft has shown sample technology to retailers from around the world and has had talks with Walmart Inc WMT.N about a potential collaboration, three of the people said.  Microsoft\u2019s technology aims to help retailers keep pace with Amazon Go, a highly automated store that opened to the public in Seattle in January. Amazon customers scan their smartphones at a turnstile to enter. Cameras and sensors identify what they remove from the shelves. When customers are finished shopping, they simply leave the store and Amazon bills their credit cards on file.  Amazon Go, which will soon open in Chicago and San Francisco, has sent rivals scrambling to prepare for yet another disruption by the world\u2019s biggest online retailer. Some have tested programs where customers scan and bag each item as they shop, with mixed results.  For Microsoft, becoming a strategic ally to retailers has meant big business. In addition to developing retail technologies, it ranks No. 2 behind Amazon in selling cloud services that are key to running e-commerce sites, for instance.  It is not clear how soon Microsoft would bring an automated checkout service to market, if at all, or whether its technology would be the answer retailers are looking for. But some see the technology as the next big innovation in shopping, one that Amazon\u2019s competitors cannot afford to ignore.  \u201cThis is the future of checking out for convenience and grocery stores,\u201d said Gene Munster, head of research at Loup Ventures in Minneapolis. The venture capital firm estimates the U.S. market for automated checkout is worth $50 billion. Cashier is one of the most commonly held jobs in the United States.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Microsoft said it \u201cdoes not comment on rumors or speculation.\u201d Walmart and Amazon declined to comment.  EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT  Microsoft\u2019s effort to date has largely fallen under its Business AI, or artificial intelligence, team, one person said. A group consisting of 10 to 15 people has worked on a host of retail store technologies, and they have presented some of their efforts in front of CEO Satya Nadella, the person said.  In a meeting with the team several months ago, Nadella recommended an \u201cintelligent edge\u201d device that could manage connected gadgets such as cameras on site with minimum data transfers to the cloud, which would cut down on costs, said the person.  Making its technology cheap enough so it does not eviscerate grocers\u2019 already thin profit margins is a major challenge for Microsoft, another person said.  Microsoft already showcases the basics for automated checkout at its Retail Experience Center in Redmond.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  It has half a dozen partners, including Redmond-based AVA Retail, that are building their own checkout-free or related services atop Microsoft\u2019s cloud, some of the people said. Sales of partners\u2019 services result in cloud revenue for Microsoft, along with insight into the market for new retail technologies.  Meanwhile, Microsoft\u2019s internal team, including a computer vision specialist hired from Amazon Go, has worked on attaching cameras to shopping carts to track customers\u2019 items. And it has studied novel ways for smartphones to play a role in the shopping experience, people said.  Still, the industry is playing catch-up to Amazon.  The company spent four years building Amazon Go in secret, before launching an employee-only pilot on its Seattle campus in 2016.

FILE PHOTO: Zhang Yiming, founder and global CEO of ByteDance, poses in Palo Alto, California, U.S., March 4, 2020. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  Concerns among major ByteDance backers such as Sequoia and General Atlantic over the financial hit of selling the popular short-video app in the United States for less than what it is worth led Zhang to opt for the sale of only a stake to Oracle, rather than an outright divestment, the sources said.  It is a risky strategy. President Donald Trump has made it clear he wants to see an outright sale of TikTok to a U.S. technology company, amid concerns among national security officials that U.S. user data could be passed on to China\u2019s Communist Party government. He has threatened to ban TikTok in the United States as early as Sept. 20 if ByteDance does not comply.  China also got involved in the process last month, updating its export control rules to give it a say over the transfer of technology, such as TikTok\u2019s recommendation algorithm, to a foreign buyer. Chinese officials have said ByteDance should not be coerced by the United States into a deal.  Microsoft executives grew frustrated over the course of the past week as ByteDance became unresponsive to the Redmond, Washington-based company\u2019s $20 billion-plus bid for TikTok\u2019s U.S. business, three of the sources said. The bid also allowed for future payments based on TikTok\u2019s performance, one of the sources added.  This offer fell short of ByteDance investors\u2019 expectations, the sources said. In arguing for its bid with the Trump administration and U.S. lawmakers, Microsoft upset Zhang, because it referred to TikTok as a security risk it could fix, the sources added. ByteDance has maintained that its ownership of TikTok presents no such risk.  All the while, Sequoia and General Atlantic were working with Oracle on an alternative deal that would avert an outright sale, according to the sources.  Concerned over ByteDance\u2019s lack of engagement, Microsoft asked the Chinese company whether it had lost out in the race for TikTok\u2019s U.S. business, one of the sources said. Microsoft also asked if it could change the deal structure to match Oracle, the source added.  ByteDance responded it would choose Oracle even if Microsoft offered the same structure and terms, the source said. Oracle had been working on the potential deal with the ByteDance investors for several weeks, and had made them and Zhang more comfortable about their partnership, according to the source.  On Sunday, Microsoft announced ByteDance had rejected its bid to acquire TikTok\u2019s U.S. business.  This account of how ByteDance picked Oracle as its partner for the TikTok deal is based on interviews with six people with knowledge of the discussions who requested anonymity to disclose details. ByteDance and Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Oracle declined to comment and pointed to its statement earlier on Monday that confirmed its participation in the proposed deal. General Atlantic and Sequoia also declined to comment.  ByteDance has worked feverishly in the last few days on a deal proposal that would allow the Chinese company to retain a minority stake in TikTok while addressing U.S. security concerns, the sources said. Zhang is referring to this deal in discussions with other ByteDance executives as a restructuring, the sources said. One of the sources called the proposed arrangement akin to a joint venture.  Oracle is in negotiations to take a sizable minority stake in TikTok\u2019s U.S. business, with the remainder owned by some large ByteDance investors, including General Atlantic and Sequoia, the sources said. Oracle would also take over the management of TikTok\u2019s user data in the United States and be responsible for its safety, according to the sources.  It is not clear what valuation this deal would infer for TikTok\u2019s U.S. business, which has as many as 100 million users.  The proposal calls for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the U.S. government panel overseeing the deal talks, to approve board directors at TikTok U.S., as well as relationships with major vendors, the sources added. The arrangements would be similar to those CFIUS put in place when Lenovo 0992.HK acquired IBM's personal computer business in 2005 and SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T acquired U.S. wireless carrier Sprint in 2013, according to the sources.  ByteDance also plans to argue that CFIUS's approval two years ago of China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co Ltd's purchase of U.S. insurer Genworth Financial Inc GNW.N offers a precedent for its proposal with Oracle, Reuters reported on Sunday.  In that deal, China Oceanwide agreed to use a U.S.-based, third-party service to manage Genworth\u2019s U.S. policyholder data. ByteDance will argue a similar arrangement with Oracle can safeguard TikTok\u2019s U.S. user data.  MORE JOBS  ByteDance has also made other concessions to appeal to Trump, the sources said. It has offered for TikTok to create 25,000 U.S. jobs, up from a little over 1,000 employees in the United States currently, according to the sources.  ByteDance is hoping that Oracle founder Larry Ellison\u2019s fundraising for Trump, as well as Oracle CEO Safra Catz\u2019s backing of Trump\u2019s transition team four years ago, will also boost its chances, the sources said.  So far, the White House has been noncommittal in its discussions with ByteDance, and it remains unclear whether the proposed deal will go ahead, the sources said. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said CFIUS would review the deal this week and make a recommendation to Trump.  The White House did not respond to a request for comment.  Reuters reported last week that China\u2019s government would rather see TikTok shut down in the United States than see it be part of a forced sale. It would need to approve the transfer of TikTok\u2019s algorithm to a foreign buyer.  The proposed deal with Oracle would not require ByteDance to apply to Chinese authorities for an export license for TikTok\u2019s algorithm, the sources said.","495":"(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Monday it was investing $1 billion in San Francisco-based OpenAI and that the two had formed a multi-year partnership to develop artificial intelligence supercomputing technologies on Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud computing service.  OpenAI was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit with $1 billion in funding from Silicon Valley investors Sam Altman, Peter Thiel and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, among others. Earlier this year, the group created a related for-profit entity to take in outside investment.  Since its founding, OpenAI has employed artificial intelligence researchers to make advances in the field, such as teaching a robotic hand to perform human-like tasks entirely in software, cutting down the cost and time to train robots.  The group has also focused on the safety and social implications of AI, researching how computers can generate realistic news stories with little more than headline suggestions and warning researchers to consider how their work and algorithms might be misused by bad actors before publishing them.  OpenAI said the Microsoft investment would help it pursue \u201cartificial general intelligence,\u201d or AGI. An AGI is the holy grail of the field and would mean the computing system can master a subject as well or better than the best humans in the world - and master more fields than any single human.  \u201cWe believe it\u2019s crucial that AGI is deployed safely and securely and that its economic benefits are widely distributed,\u201d Altman said in a statement. \u201cWe are excited about how deeply Microsoft shares this vision.\u201d  Microsoft said the two companies would jointly build new AI technologies on Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud computing service. The two also said that OpenAI would move many, though not all, of its services to Azure and that Microsoft would be its \u201cpreferred\u201d partner to commercialize new services.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The two parties declined to answer questions from Reuters about the terms of the deal. Earlier this year, OpenAI created a for-profit limited partnership to take outside investment. The for-profit entity is ultimately controlled by the nonprofit\u2019s board.  When OpenAI created the structure in March, it said investors who put money into the for-profit entity would have their returns capped and that the nonprofit\u2019s mission would take precedence over turning a profit.  Microsoft and OpenAI declined to answer questions about whether and how Microsoft\u2019s return on its $1 billion investment would be capped, or how any revenue and profits from jointly developed technologies would be shared.  The two firms also declined to say whether Microsoft\u2019s investment would be made in cash, or whether it would involve credits for the Azure cloud computing service.  Cloud computing services are a major cost for OpenAI, which spent $7.9 million on cloud computing in the 2017 tax year, or about a quarter of its total functional expenses for that year, according to filings with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.","496":"NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The University of Notre Dame bought streaming company Netflix Inc\u2019s stock, slashed its holdings in Microsoft Corp as well as the Class C shares of Alphabet Inc, and sold its stake in Open Text Corp, Barron\u2019s reported on Sunday, citing the university\u2019s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol\/File Photo  Last month, Microsoft beat favorite Amazon for the contract, called the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, or JEDI, which is part of a broad modernization of the Pentagon\u2019s information technology systems.  Here is a timeline of important dates leading up to the award:  JULY 26, 2018: The Pentagon released the final request for proposals from competitors, seeking a single winner to allow for the most rapid adoption of the technology. It said the deal\u2019s initial two-year period would provide time to ensure JEDI was up to standards, noting that new contractors would be needed for other cloud computing demands in the future. The contract, valued at $10 billion over 10 years, was set to be awarded in September.  AUGUST 6, 2018: Oracle Corp ORCL.N filed a protest with the DOD over its plans to award the contract to a single company instead of allowing for multiple winners, arguing that the Pentagon would be locked into a legacy contract for a decade or more. DOD's Government Accountability Office had until November to respond.  OCTOBER 8, 2018: Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google said it was no longer vying for the $10 billion cloud computing contract with the DOD, in part because the company's new ethical guidelines did not align with the project, without elaborating.  OCTOBER 9, 2018: Microsoft said its expanded Azure cloud service to help government clients save data on their own servers would be available by the end of the first quarter of 2019, as it battled Amazon.com for the contract.[L4N1WP3IO]  NOVEMBER 14, 2018: The Government Accountability Office denied the protest filed by Oracle, finding that the agency \u201creasonably\u201d determined that the single-award approach was in the government\u2019s best interests for reasons including national security concerns and complied with applicable law.  APRIL 26, 2019: Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp were selected to continue competing for Pentagon cloud-computing services as part of a contract that could be worth some $10 billion.  The selection left Oracle and IBM Corp IBM.N out of the competition for the contract, which is part of a broad modernization of Pentagon information technology systems.  JULY 18, 2019: U.S. President Donald Trump said his administration was looking closely at Amazon.com\u2019s bid on a $10 billion cloud contract with the DOD after getting complaints from other technology companies.  JULY 19, 2019: Four Republican members of U.S. Congress, including House Armed Services Committee ranking member Mac Thornberry, sent a letter to Trump urging him to move forward with a $10 billion cloud contract with the DOD.  AUGUST 1, 2019: The Pentagon decided to put on hold its decision to award the $10 billion cloud-computing contract after Trump said his administration was examining Amazon.com Inc\u2019s bid following complaints from other technology companies.  AUGUST 5, 2019: Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Jack Reed asked U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper if \u201coutside\u201d influence caused him to delay awarding a $10 billion cloud-computing contract, after Trump suggested Amazon.com Inc should not win it.  OCTOBER 22, 2019: U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper removed himself from reviewing a disputed $10 billion cloud-computing contract because of a possible conflict of interest.  OCTOBER 25, 2019: The Defense Department said that Microsoft Corp has won the U.S. Pentagon\u2019s $10 billion cloud-computing contract, beating out favorite Amazon.

The city - home to offices of Microsoft and Google - this month saw its heaviest rainfall in a century, which left 70 dead and 5.7 billion rupees ($77 million) in damage to roads and drains, officials said.  In many cities in India, which find themselves increasingly caught between worsening droughts and deluges, urban planners have rarely considered growing climate risks when designing projects.  That lack of preparation - a global problem - is expected to be hugely costly, with about $90 trillion likely to be spent worldwide building and updating infrastructure by 2030, according to the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate.  But India - hit by worsening disaster-related losses - hopes to begin correcting that with a project launched last month to train cities to become climate smart.  \u201cCities are experiencing huge variability in climate... one year there is flood, another year water scarcity,\u201d said Umamaheshwaran Rajasekar, who heads the Climate Centre for Cities at India\u2019s National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA).  The institute is helping India\u2019s housing and urban affairs ministry to implement the project, with Rajasekar at the helm.  \u201cIt is not about looking at the past but looking at the future... how we can enable future development through informed action,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.  The effort is part of an ambitious broader plan to modernise cities with everything from high-speed internet to better transport systems. Under it, 139 cities will be trained to integrate climate risk in the planning stage of projects.  The \u201cClimate Smart Cities Assessment Framework\u201d will tackle the \u201cincreasing frequency of cyclones, floods, heatwaves, water scarcity and drought-like conditions\u201d, according to the government.  Cities will incorporate climate considerations in their management of water, waste and mobility, and in projects designed to make cities walkable and air breathable.  Virtual trainings have already begun with city planners and municipal authorities, officials said.  Several Indian cities have over the past few years worked on achieving ambitious U.N.-led global goals to make cities sustainable and protect the planet but on a \u201ccase by case basis\u201d, said NIUA\u2019s Rajasekar.  \u201cThese actions were happening in parts but we want to make climate part of their ongoing activity,\u201d Rajasekar said.  \u201cCities should be informed of future climatic and demographic changes.\u201d  CLIMATE COST  Threats to India\u2019s cities are growing amid worsening climate risks.  Last year the country experienced a longer-than-usual summer, the biggest monsoon rains in 25 years, a record number of cyclones and unusual cold waves.  In August this year, a new bridge in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh - still awaiting its official inauguration - was washed away as the river flowing under it swelled after heavy rains, local media reported.  Heavy rainfall has hit operations and shut down the largest and busiest airport in coastal Kerala state\u2019s Kochi for several days in 2018 and 2019.  This month, machinery deployed at a planned new airport site in suburban Mumbai was submerged in floodwater amid heavy rainfall and water pouring in from a river diverted to make way for the airport, officials said.  Delhi and its satellite town Gurugram also were waterlogged once again this year as heavy rainfall lashed the capital.  India has ranked among the top 10 countries globally in disaster deaths with a toll of 98,000 lives lost between 1996 and 2015, according to the U.N. disaster risk agency.  Financial losses from climate-related disasters also totalled about $80 billion for that period, it said.  Damodara Sivananda Pai, head of climate research and services at the India Meteorological Department, said the increasing rainfall over the last decade was in part a product of rising heat linked to climate change.  But human changes to land also are playing a role in worsening flooding, he said.  \u201cEarlier, the rain would be absorbed in the soil. Now our drains are choked. Because of urbanisation, the impact (of the rainfall) is more.\u201d  \u2018DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY\u2019  India\u2019s population in the 70 years since it won independence from colonial rule has surged from about 320 million to 1.3 billion, and the percentage of people living in urban areas has jumped as well, the country\u2019s census data and studies show.  By 2030, India is expected to be home to seven megacities with a population of more than 10 million, according to government projections.  While the government supports urban growth, which can create opportunities for people, \u201cthe problem is, how do we want to grow?\u201d asked Hyderabad-based urban planner and architect Srinivas Murthy.  Cities in India have expanded into adjoining agricultural land, buildings have been constructed on filled-in lakes and roads are being built on land reclaimed from the sea to accommodate growing populations, expanding industries and more traffic.  Some of those changes, however, are leaving cities more vulnerable to growing climate threats, from sea level rise to growing water shortages, environmentalists say.  \u201cWe are in a rush to catch up with the West when we should have learned from them,\u201d said activist Sumaira Abdulali who has for years campaigned against destruction of beaches and India\u2019s Western Ghats.  \u201cCOVID-19 has brought (the impacts of) interference with nature into our consciousness, yet we are not planning in terms of protecting the environment,\u201d she said.  Still, the project to help cities become more climate-smart has stoked hopes for change.  Bedoshruti Sadhukhan, senior programme coordinator at ICLEI South Asia - part of the Local Governments for Sustainability network - said infrastructure now being planned will have to factor in rising populations, growing demand for roads and water, and the impact of climate change over the next 50 to 100 years.  Right now, \"that thinking which we want cities to take up is not happening strongly... but this (new project) is a chance to do things differently and do them well,\" she said.

Subscribers to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, priced at $14.99 monthly, will be able to play more than 150 games via the cloud on Xbox consoles, Android devices and PCs.  A subscriber won\u2019t even need to buy a console to play the games, just an Android device and a supported controller.  The launch in 22 countries, including the United States and 19 European countries, marks a shift for Microsoft into cloud gaming, which removes the need for bulky hardware but requires a fast internet connection. New entrants include Google GOOGL.O, which has struggled to build a fanbase for its Stadia service.  \u201cWe built this experience so that it requires as little bandwidth as possible,\u201d said Kareem Choudhry, Microsoft\u2019s head of cloud gaming. \u201cWe\u2019re also working with ISPs (internet service providers) around the world to ensure a strong connection between gamers and our Azure datacenters.\u201d The Xbox Game Pass service has more than 10 million members.  Across the industry, cloud gaming revenue is expected to grow to $4.8 billion by 2023 from nearly $600 million this year, according to Guilherme Fernandes, analyst at gaming analysis firm Newzoo.  Subscribers to the Xbox cloud service will be able to play hit titles like \u201cSea of Thieves\u201d and \u201cGears 5\u201d as part of the monthly fee. The games library is seen as key for the incumbents looking to maintain their lead.

Microsoft said this week the Xbox Series S will go on sale in November priced at $299.99, with the more powerful Xbox Series X priced at $499.99. Sony 6758.T, widely seen as the victor of the last generation console battle, already offers cloud gaming via the PlayStation Now service, but this is not available on mobile devices.  Sony has not yet announced pricing for its next-generation PlayStation 5 console.  Gaming is on a tear due to demand from stuck-at-home users during the COVID-19 pandemic. Microsoft is banking on offering users many ways to play via the cloud service and consoles at different price points to give it an edge.  A constraint on the growth of cloud gaming is latency, or the time delay between pressing a button and getting the reaction on screen, with deployment of 5G telecom services expected to speed up its adoption. Microsoft's service won't be available on Apple AAPL.O devices. Epic Games is currently engaged in a legal dispute with Apple over its commission fees, in a fight seen as having implications for revenue models across the industry.","509":"FILE PHOTO: The GameStop store sign is seen at its shop in Westminster, Colorado January 14, 2014.

A Belgian court and the Belgian Institute of Postal and Telecommunications Service (IBPT) had sought guidance from the European Court of Justice on whether Skype\u2019s SkypeOut service, which allows users to call from computers to a fixed or mobile line for a fee, should be subject to the same regulation as a traditional telecoms company.  Skype had argued that it did not transmit signals itself and did not provide any electronic communications services such as those defined by current EU rules.  Microsoft said it would comply with the ruling, which will require the paid-for service to adhere to more onerous regulation.  Seeking to address the gap between traditional telecoms providers and new internet-based rivals, the European Commission two years ago adopted rules for the sector known as the European Electronic Communications Code which covers Skype, Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger and other voice over internet protocol (VoIP) services.

The focus on removing existing carbon from the atmosphere sets Microsoft\u2019s climate goals apart from other corporate pledges which have focused on cutting ongoing emissions or preventing future ones.  The announcement by the world\u2019s largest software company is the latest in a flurry of climate goals set out by firms after President Donald Trump announced in 2017 his decision to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement, the global pact to fight climate change.

The report follows a Reuters story revealing that one of Biden\u2019s main campaign advisory firms had been warned by the software giant that it was in the crosshairs of suspected Russian hackers.  The Microsoft statement highlights how advisors to both presidential campaigns are at risk from digital spies from around the globe, as the two candidates face off on Nov.3 in one of the most consequential U.S. presidential elections for decades.  The announcement by Microsoft\u2019s Vice President for customer security Tom Burt, says the same group of Russian cyberspies who intervened in the 2016 U.S. election had spent the past year trying to break into accounts belonging to political consultants serving both Republicans and Democrats as well as advocacy organizations and think tanks.  Burt also said Chinese hackers had gone after people \u201cclosely associated with U.S. presidential campaigns and candidates\u201d - including an unnamed Biden ally who was targeted at their personal email address and \u201cat least one prominent individual formerly associated with the Trump Administration.\u201d  He added that Iranian hackers - which Microsoft has already called out publicly for attempts to spy on the Trump administration - had tried to log into accounts belonging to Trump administration officials and members of the Republican president\u2019s campaign staff.  Microsoft\u2019s announcement was planned before Reuters broke the news that hackers targeted Washington-based SKDKnickerbocker, a campaign strategy and communications firm working with Biden and other prominent Democrats.  Burt did not name any of the political consultants involved and Microsoft declined to comment on whether SKDK was among the consultants it had identified as targets.  SKDK has declined comment.  Burt said the Chinese effort to compromise the Biden ally and the Iranian spying against the Trump campaign were unsuccessful, but his blog post provided no detail on the hacking campaign attributed to Russia or the effort to compromise the well-known former Trump associate. Speaking generally, he said that foreign hacking was intensifying as the vote drew nearer.  \u201cThe activity we are announcing today makes clear that foreign activity groups have stepped up their efforts targeting the 2020 election as had been anticipated,\u201d Burt said.  The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s top cyber official, Christopher Krebs, said Microsoft\u2019s warning was consistent with earlier statements issued by the intelligence community about Russian, Chinese, and Iranian spying on election-related targets.  \u201cIt is important to highlight that none are involved in maintaining or operating voting infrastructure and there was no identified impact on election systems,\u201d Krebs said.  The Biden campaign said it was aware of the attempt to break into \u201cnon-campaign email accounts of individuals affiliated with the campaign.\u201d  \u201cWe have known from the beginning of our campaign that we would be subject to such attacks and we are prepared for them,\u201d Biden\u2019s team said in a statement.  The Trump campaign said it too was aware of the break-in attempts. \u201cWe are a large target, so it is not surprising to see malicious activity directed at the campaign or our staff,\u201d Deputy National Press Secretary Thea McDonald said in a statement.  The Chinese and Russian embassies in Washington and the Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York also did not immediately return messages. All three governments have previously denied allegations of cyberespionage.  State-backed hackers regularly target one another\u2019s politicians, their advisors, and their campaigns, but the issue has gained particular salience in the United States and Europe following hack-and-leak operations that targeted Trump\u2019s 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron ahead of his election in 2017 and the British Conservative Party before parliamentary elections last year.

Australia has introduced laws that would force internet giant Google and social media heavyweight Facebook Inc to negotiate payments to domestic media outlets whose content links drive traffic to their platforms.  However, the Big Tech firms have called the laws unworkable and said last month they would withdraw key services from Australia if the regulations went ahead. Those services include Google\u2019s search engine, which has 94% of the country\u2019s search market, according to industry data.  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has since spoken with Morrison about the new rules, the tech company told Reuters, and on Monday, Morrison said the software company was ready to grow the presence of its search tool Bing, the distant No. 2 player.  \u201cI can tell you, Microsoft\u2019s pretty confident, when I spoke to Satya,\u201d Morrison told reporters in Canberra, without giving further detail of the conversation.  \u201cWe just want the rules in the digital world to be the same that exist in the real world, in the physical world,\u201d Morrison added.

The focus on clearing carbon from the atmosphere sets Microsoft\u2019s climate goals apart from other corporate pledges which have focused on cutting ongoing emissions or preventing future ones.  \u201cIf the last decade has taught us anything, it\u2019s that technology built without these principles can do more harm than good,\u201d Chief Executive Satya Nadella said at a media event at Microsoft\u2019s headquarters in Redmond, Washington.  \u201cWe must begin to offset the damaging effects of climate change,\u201d he said, adding if global temperatures continue to rise unabated \u201cthe results will be devastating.\u201d  The plan includes the creation of a \u201cClimate Innovation Fund,\u201d which will invest $1 billion over the next four years to speed up the development of carbon removal technology.  The announcement by the world\u2019s largest software company reflects the rising profile of U.S. corporate action after President Donald Trump announced in 2017 his decision to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement, the global pact to fight climate change.  HISTORICAL EMISSIONS A NEW GOAL  Microsoft\u2019s pledge to address its historical emissions may resonate with some developing nations which say countries that created the most carbon, and wealth in the process, are not taking responsibility for their past pollution.  U.S. Senators Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, and Mike Braun, an Indiana Republican, applauded Microsoft.  \u201cThe scope and scale of this proposal is exactly the kind of bold action we need from the business community,\u201d the pair, chairs of the bipartisan Senate Climate Solutions Caucus, said in a statement.  Microsoft plans to cut carbon emissions by more than half by 2030 across its supply chain, an effort requiring technology that does not fully exist, company President Brad Smith said.  Slideshow ( 11 images )  He said Microsoft would widen the reach of a fee it has charged its business divisions to account for their carbon emissions.  Microsoft said it charges $15 per metric ton for core carbon emissions internally and will expand the coverage in phases to cover all emissions. Microsoft\u2019s price is lower than that for carbon traded in California, where it was $17 per ton in the most recent auction, and the European Union, where it was estimated to trade at 26.57 euros, or $29.58, in the current quarter.  CARBON CAPTURE RAISES QUESTIONS  Co-founder Bill Gates was an early backer of British Columbia-based Carbon Engineering, among a handful of developers of direct air capture technology.  Carbon Engineering CEO Steve Oldham said the firm\u2019s first direct air capture plant is under construction and is expected to capture 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year.  Microsoft \u201cis at the helm of what could be a new movement towards negative emissions,\u201d Elizabeth V. Sturcken of the Environmental Defense Fund, said in a statement, adding that the nonprofit advocacy group was eager for Microsoft to use its political influence as well.  Microsoft\u2019s goal of removing enough carbon by 2050 to account for all its emissions since its founding in 1975 includes direct emissions from sources such as company vehicles and indirect emissions from electricity use.  Question remain about the technology that Microsoft is considering. Sue Reid, vice president of climate and energy at U.S. nonprofit Ceres, which works with companies on sustainability commitments, said the economics of direct air capture have yet to be worked out, and reforestation rates may not be fast enough to catch up with growing emissions.  \u201cThat math is all facing some new uncertainty and vulnerabilities tied to exacerbated climate change impact, (like there being) more wildfires,\u201d she said.  Slideshow ( 11 images )  INVESTORS WANT ACTION ON CLIMATE  Microsoft\u2019s announcement comes as big investors pay more attention to how companies tackle climate change.  Earlier this week, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said companies must act or face investors\u2019 anger over how unsustainable business practices might curb their future wealth.  But even as technology companies have stepped in with climate goal plans, they have faced employee criticism for doing too little.  Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, the world's largest online retailer, last year pledged to be \"net zero carbon\" by 2040 and to buy 100,000 electric delivery vans from a startup, after employee activists pushed the retailer to toughen its stance on climate change.  Microsoft plans to become net zero carbon a decade earlier than Amazon, although its emissions are roughly a third of Amazon\u2019s.  Microsoft expects to release 16 million metric tons of carbon in 2020, including indirect emissions from activities like corporate travel.  Amazon, whose cloud business is bigger than Microsoft\u2019s, delivers billions of packages as the largest internet retailer and owns grocer Whole Foods. It emitted more than 44 million metric tons of carbon in 2018, including indirect sources.  It was not immediately clear if the figures reported by the companies were exactly comparable.  EMPLOYEE ACTIVISTS HIGHLIGHT OIL CONTRACTS  Microsoft and Amazon have come under fire from activist tech workers who have demanded that they stop supplying technology to oil and gas companies because of the polluting nature of fossil-fuel extraction. Microsoft in 2017 announced a multi-year deal to sell cloud services to U.S. energy giant Chevron Corp CVX.N.  Microsoft Workers 4 Good, which says it represents Microsoft employees aiming to hold the company to its stated values, lauded the climate plan but said \u201cthis goal is incompatible with contracts that aim to increase oil extraction, a process which we know is not sustainable.\u201d  In a blog post, Microsoft on Thursday reiterated its commitment to working with oil and gas providers, saying it is \u201cimperative that we enable energy companies to transition\u201d to renewable energy and carbon-capture technologies.  Bill Weihl, former director of sustainability at Facebook Inc FB.O, said Microsoft does not take into account that its work with oil companies could outweigh the gains of measures Microsoft takes on its own carbon reduction.  \u201cThere is good stuff here,\u201d Weihl said. \u201cBut the topline message, that this is urgent, is not matched by what they\u2019re focusing on.\u201d","518":"(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp MSFT.O on Wednesday reported quarterly sales and profit that beat Wall Street expectations, driven by the first acceleration of Azure cloud computing revenue growth in eight quarters amid a pitched battle with Amazon.com Inc\u2019s AMZN.O cloud unit.  Shares of the world\u2019s largest software company hit an all-time high in after-hours trading. The results reflected the approach of Chief Executive Satya Nadella, who for five years has re-centered Microsoft around the cloud, renting out its computing power and technology to large businesses.  Microsoft said Azure, its primary competitor to Amazon\u2019s cloud, grew 62% in the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31, down from a 76% revenue growth rate the year before but up from 59% in the fiscal first quarter.  Microsoft\u2019s chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said increased consumption of Azure services, which include offerings such as computing power to run applications and data storage services, drove the revenue growth.  \u201cWe did have good usage, which matters a ton to that number,\u201d Hood told Reuters. \u201cThe core thing that we focused on - which is consumption growth - was quite good.\u201d  Microsoft said revenue for its \u201ccommercial cloud\u201d - a combination of Azure and the cloud-based versions of software such as Office - reached $12.5 billion, up from $9 billion the year before.  The commercial cloud gross profit margin - a key measure of cloud profitability that Microsoft has told investors it expects to improve - was 67%, versus 62% the year before.

Hood said the company was working to improve margins on its core Azure services, which rely on data centers that can cost billions of dollars to build. She cited \u201chardware improvements and taking advantage of those hardware improvements.\u201d  Microsoft\u2019s revenue and profit for the second quarter were $36.9 billion and $1.51 per share, respectively, compared with analyst estimates of $35.7 billion and $1.32 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Microsoft has focused on hybrid cloud computing \u2013 in which a business can use a mix of Microsoft\u2019s data centers and its own \u2013 as well as on delivering its longstanding productivity programs such as Office via the cloud.  The shift to the cloud has driven Microsoft's shares up more than 50% in the past year, as it gains ground against market leader Amazon and also parries the threats to its classic software programs from newer entrants like Alphabet Inc\u2019s GOOGL.O Google.  In 2019, Microsoft had 22% share of the cloud computing infrastructure market, compared with 45% at Amazon and 5% from Google, according to data from Forrester Research.  \u201cAzure\u2019s renewed growth doesn\u2019t yet pose a threat to AWS\u2019s supremacy in the cloud market, but it does present an opportunity to further close the gap on Amazon and increase its lead over other cloud providers,\u201d said Andrew MacMillen of Nucleus Research.  The company\u2019s Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes Azure, reported revenue that rose 27% to $11.9 billion in the quarter, versus expectations of $11.4 billion. For the fiscal third quarter ending in March, Microsoft forecast revenue with a midpoint of $11.9 billion for the unit, compared with analyst expectations of $11.4 billion.  Its Productivity and Business Process unit, which contains the LinkedIn social network, reported $11.8 billion in revenue compared with estimates of $11.4 billion.  Revenue in the unit that contains Windows was $13.2 billion, compared with estimates of $12.8 billion. Over the past year, Windows sales were hampered by shortages of PC chips from Intel Corp INTC.O, but the chipmaker said last week it had alleviated most of those supply concerns.  Microsoft forecast revenue of between $10.75 billion and $11.15 billion for the unit containing Windows in the fiscal third quarter, a wider-than-normal forecast range that the company said was because of uncertainty surrounding the spread of the coronavirus in China.","519":"(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp MSFT.O on Thursday beat analysts' estimates for fourth-quarter revenue and profit, driven by continued sales increases from its cloud business and sending its shares to all-time highs.  Since Chief Executive Satya Nadella took over in 2014, Microsoft has been shifting away from its Windows operating system software and toward cloud services, in which customers move their computing work to data centers managed by Microsoft.  Revenue growth in Azure was 64% in the fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30, compared with 89% a year earlier and 73% in the prior quarter. Microsoft does not provide an absolute revenue figure for Azure, blending it into its \u201cintelligent cloud unit,\u201d which had revenue of $11.4 billion compared with analyst expectations of $11.0 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  (For an interactive graphic, click here tmsnrt.rs\/2JIzvfe)  Microsoft also forecasted between $10.3 billion and $10.5 billion in intelligent cloud sales for the fiscal first quarter, with a midpoint above analyst estimates of $10.13 billion. The forecast helped send shares of Microsoft up more than 2.6% to record highs above $140 in after-hours trading.  Cloud growth powered Microsoft\u2019s market value past $1 trillion for the first time in April. On Thursday, Microsoft\u2019s Azure-based business segment for the first time ever reported slightly more quarterly revenue than its Windows-based segment.  \u201cThe pressure was obviously on but they executed,\u201d said Hal Eddins, chief economist for Microsoft shareholder Capital Investment Counsel. \u201cThe cloud is such a key driver of growth for them and they seem to have painted a big bullseye on the back of AWS.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: The Microsoft sign is shown on top of the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 19,2018.

Microsoft has a share of 14.6%, while Google has 9.9%.  Microsoft has also gained ground in the past year by bundling its Azure computing service for developers along with Office and other software products for end users, such as in the more than $2 billion cloud deal it signed with AT&T Inc T.N earlier this week.  Microsoft has tried to set itself apart from AWS by combining its traditional software that runs in a customer\u2019s own data center with its Azure products, a strategy that Chris Voce, analyst at Forrester, said helped power the company\u2019s results.  \u201cIts hybrid cloud strategy has resonated with enterprises where this is a more realistic and flexible approach,\u201d Voce said.  Revenue in Microsoft\u2019s productivity software unit jumped 14.3% to $11.05 billion, driven by double-digit revenue growth for LinkedIn and Office 365.

The nine justices will hear arguments on Tuesday in a case that pits the interests of tech companies and privacy advocates in safeguarding customer data against the demands of law enforcement in obtaining information crucial to criminal and counterterrorism investigations.  The case began with a 2013 warrant obtained by prosecutors for emails of a suspect in a drug trafficking investigation that were stored in Microsoft computer servers in Dublin. The company challenged whether a domestic warrant covered data stored abroad. The Justice Department said because Microsoft is based in the United States, prosecutors were entitled to the data.  The case is being closely watched by other countries wrestling with similar concerns, including members of the European Union. A ruling is due by the end of June.  A 2016 decision by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals siding with Microsoft marked a victory for tech firms that increasingly offer cloud computing services in which data is stored remotely. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court.  Globally dominant American tech companies have expressed concern that customers will go elsewhere if they think the U.S. government\u2019s reach extends to data centers all around the world without changes being made to the law.  Microsoft, which has 100 data centers in 40 countries, was the first American company to challenge a domestic search warrant seeking data held outside the United States.  Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, told reporters last week the U.S. government should not be able to act unilaterally to access such data without taking into account the laws and interests of other countries.  \u201cIt\u2019s more likely to be a recipe for international tension and chaos,\u201d Smith said.  Solicitor General Noel Francisco, the administration\u2019s top lawyer in Supreme Court cases, said in court papers that a ruling for Microsoft \u201cwould hamper domestic law enforcement and counterterrorism efforts.\u201d  If the Supreme Court were to rule in favor of Microsoft, the government could still gain access data held overseas, but the process would be more cumbersome and potentially take longer.  Lawmakers are considering making changes to the 1986 law.  Bipartisan legislation has been introduced in Congress to update the statute, a move backed by both Microsoft and the administration. The measure would let U.S. judges issue warrants while giving companies an avenue to object if the request conflicts with foreign law. If Congress were to pass the bill before the Supreme Court rules, the case would likely become moot.  BEYOND REACH  Though Microsoft is based in the United States - Redmond, Washington, to be precise - the appeals court said the emails were beyond the reach of domestic search warrants obtained under a 1986 U.S. law called the Stored Communications Act.  The Microsoft customer whose emails were sought told the company he was based in Ireland when he signed up for his account.  Other companies including IBM Corp, Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google filed court papers backing Microsoft. Google has mounted challenges similar to Microsoft\u2019s.  The administration has the support of 35 states led by Vermont who say they routinely seek access to data stored overseas, especially in cases involving child pornography.  Several foreign governments, including Ireland and Britain, filed court papers raising concerns about the U.S. government\u2019s position.  Ireland\u2019s government said in its brief that the question of how law enforcement authorities can access such information is already covered by a 2001 treaty with the United States that allows for information sharing and enforcement of court orders.  The treaty\u2019s procedures \u201crepresent the most appropriate means to address requests such as those which are the object of the warrant in question,\u201d Ireland\u2019s brief said.  The European Commission, representing the 28-country European Union, filed a brief saying that when a country is seeking data from outside its jurisdiction \u201cthe interests and laws of that foreign jurisdiction must be taken into account.\u201d  The Supreme Court has ruled twice in recent years in major cases concerning how criminal law applies to new technology, both times ruling against law enforcement. In 2012, the court held that a warrant is required to place a GPS tracking device on a vehicle. In 2014, the court ruled that police need a warrant to search a cellphone seized during an arrest.  In the court\u2019s current term, which ends in June, the justices are due to rule on another privacy issue on whether police need search warrants to access cellphone location information held by wireless carriers. Based on the Nov. 29 oral argument, the justices appear likely to rule against law enforcement again.","526":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp MSFT.O recently alerted one of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's main election campaign advisory firms that it had been targeted by suspected Russian state-backed hackers, according to four people briefed on the matter.  The hacking attempts targeted staff at Washington-based SKDKnickerbocker, a campaign strategy and communications firm working with Biden and other prominent Democrats, over the past two months, the sources said.  Microsoft Corp MSFT.O identified the suspected hacking group as the same set of spies blamed by the U.S. government for breaking into the campaign of Democratic former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and leaking the emails of her staff, two of the sources said.  The group, which many cyber researchers refer to as \u201cFancy Bear,\u201d is controlled by the Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, according to reports from the U.S. intelligence community released after the 2016 election.  A person familiar with SKDK\u2019s response to the attempts said the hackers failed to gain access to the firm\u2019s networks. \u201cThey are well-defended, so there has been no breach,\u201d the person said.  U.S. intelligence agencies have raised alarms about possible efforts by foreign governments to interfere in the November presidential election.  Investigations by former special counsel Robert Mueller and the Senate intelligence committee both concluded that affiliates of the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election to try to help Republican Donald Trump get elected. Mueller has warned that Russia was meddling in the current campaign.  SKDK Vice Chair Hilary Rosen declined to comment. The Biden campaign said it was aware Microsoft said a foreign actor had tried and failed to access \u201cnon-campaign email accounts of individuals affiliated with the campaign.\u201d  Microsoft, which has shared with SKDK its assessment that Russian state-backer hackers targeted the firm, declined to comment.  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the allegations as \u201cnonsense.\u201d Moscow has repeatedly denied using hacking to interfere in other countries\u2019 elections.  One of the sources familiar with the incident said it was not clear whether Biden\u2019s campaign was the target or whether the hackers were attempting to gain access to information about other SKDK clients.  SKDK managing director Anita Dunn was a White House communications director during the Barack Obama presidency and serves the Biden campaign as a senior advisor.  The attempts to infiltrate SKDK were recently flagged to the campaign firm by Microsoft, which identified hackers tied to the Russian government as the likely culprits, according to the three sources briefed on the matter.  Democratic U.S. presidential nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks to the media at the end of his visit, before leaving for Delaware, at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport in Detroit, Michigan, September 9, 2020. REUTERS\/Leah Millis  The attacks included phishing, a hacking method which seeks to trick users into disclosing passwords, as well as other efforts to infiltrate SKDK\u2019s network, the three sources said.  A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment.  Microsoft believes Fancy Bear is behind the attacks based on an analysis of the group\u2019s hacking techniques and network infrastructure, one of the sources said.  The company, which has extraordinary visibility on digital threats via its widely used Windows operating system and cloud services such as Office 365, has taken an increasingly active role in calling out state-backed cyberespionage. In 2018, the company launched its Defending Democracy initiative, aimed in part at safeguarding campaigns from hackers.  SKDK is closely associated with the Democratic Party, having worked on six presidential campaigns and numerous congressional races. In addition to its current work for Biden, the firm in 2018 worked on successful governors\u2019 races in Kansas and Connecticut.","527":"(Repeats story from Friday, May 8, to include codes for wider distribution; no changes to text)  MILAN, May 8 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. said on Friday it would create its first datacentre region in Italy under a $1.5 billion investment plan as the U.S. company expands its cloud computing services to more locations across the world.

The new datacentre region will be based in the Milan area, joining Microsoft\u2019s other 60 regions announced globally.  In February, Microsoft announced plans to open a new datacentre region in Spain and earlier this week the company said it would invest $1 billion in Poland as part of plans to open a data centre to provide cloud services to businesses and institutions.

Trump has given Microsoft until Sept. 15 to put together a blueprint for an acquisition that safeguards the personal data of Americans stored on the short-video app, and he has issued an order to ban it if there is no deal by then.  Microsoft is negotiating a transition period that will give it time to ringfence TikTok technologically from ByteDance after they agree to a deal, Reuters reported on Aug. 2.  The clean break that Trump and lawmakers envision could take a year or more, some of the sources said.  TikTok is functionally and technically similar to ByteDance-owned Douyin, which is available only in China, and shares technical resources with it and other ByteDance-owned properties, people familiar with the matter said.  ByteDance started working on their technological separation several months ago amid scrutiny from the U.S. government, a source familiar with the process told Reuters. It began planning for a split as part of a strategy to shift its power from China, Reuters has reported.  While the code for the app, which determines the look and feel of TikTok, has been separated from Douyin, the server code is still partially shared across other ByteDance products, the source said. The server code provides basic functionality of the apps such as data storage, algorithms for moderating and recommending content and the management of user profiles.  To ensure uninterrupted TikTok service, Microsoft would likely need to rely on ByteDance\u2019s code while it reviews and revises the code, and moves to a new back-end infrastructure to serve users, according to cyber security expert Ryan Speers at River Loop Security, which provides services including cybersecurity due diligence for deals.  Any continuing technical or operational reliance of the U.S. business on the Chinese company after the sale generally would have been unacceptable to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), said Aimen Mir, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury responsible for CFIUS, now a partner at the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer.  In the past, CFIUS has required adoption of increased protections pending a sale, including separation of the U.S. business from foreign sellers to the furthest extent possible, he said.  Another challenge Microsoft faces is how it will transfer what is viewed as TikTok\u2019s secret sauce, the recommendation engine that keeps users glued to their screens. This engine, or algorithm, powers TikTok\u2019s \u201cFor You\u201d page, which recommends the next video to watch based on an analysis of user behavior.  TikTok uses recommendation algorithms that are independent from Douyin, according to two sources familiar with the matter. But what makes it tick is the content and user information that is fed into the algorithm.  \u201cAlgorithms are not worth anything without the data,\u201d said Jim DuBois, a former Chief Information Officer at Microsoft. DuBois is a venture adviser at Ignition Partners. \u201cSegmenting the data for those countries is a significant task.\u201d  Microsoft\u2019s negotiations for the acquisition of the U.S., Canada, New Zealand and Australia operations of TikTok complicates a separation. Not only would TikTok have to be separated from ByteDance, it would have to be broken up from TikTok\u2019s other regions. This adds to the technical challenges because of the amount of data involved.  \u201cThe biggest part is separating the user data - both content and data about users,\u201d DuBois said, noting hard disks of data would likely need to be transferred between ByteDance and Microsoft.  The proposed timeline makes consummating a deal very challenging, said Karen C. Hermann, a deal lawyer at Venable LLP: \u201cIt can sometimes take months and months just to identify the business needs of the divested business, what IP and other assets it uses exclusively, and what assets and IP it shares with other businesses in the company group.\u201d (Reporting by Echo Wang in New York and Paresh Dave in San Francisco; additional reporting by Katie Paul in San Francisco; editing by Kenneth Li and Grant McCool)","530":"(Corrects first paragraph to say first instead of second quarter)  Oct 23 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp\u2019s Azure cloud services grew more slowly in its first quarter even as profit and revenue beat estimates, the company said on Wednesday, a sign that competition is picking up in its fastest-growing business.  Revenue from Azure increased 59% in the quarter ended Sept. 30, but came in well below last year\u2019s 76% growth.  Since Chief Executive Satya Nadella took over in 2014, Microsoft has been diversifying from its Windows operating system software, and has focused on its cloud services, in which customers move their computing work to data centers managed by Microsoft.  Strength in that business powered Microsoft\u2019s market value past $1 trillion for the first time in April. However, the business faces intense competition from Amazon.com Inc\u2019s AWS and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google.  Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said Microsoft\u2019s results \u201cwere strong across the board with nearly all key metrics beating consensus.\u201d  But Azure was the key metric that missed slightly, said Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company.  \u201cAzure came in at 59% (revenue growth) and consensus was at 60%,\u201d he said. \u201cOther than that, it was a good quarter, but if you want to throw rocks at it, that is how you would do it.\u201d  Worldwide spending on cloud infrastructure services grew nearly 38% year-on-year in the calendar second quarter to $26.3 billion, according to data from research firm Canalys. Amazon Web Services still dominates the market with a 31.5% share, followed by Microsoft with 18.1%.  Microsoft shares, up 34% for the year, were 0.1% lower in volatile after-market trading.  The technology company\u2019s personal computing division accounted for the largest share of its revenue, rising 4% to $11.13 billion. The unit includes Windows software, Xbox gaming consoles, online search advertising and Surface personal computers.  Windows results were boosted by 19% revenue growth for business computers, which was offset by a 7% decline for consumer PCs.  Mike Spencer, head of investor relations for Microsoft, said Google Chromebooks continued eat into Windows revenue for entry-level laptops.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - If the tech sector is in perpetual party mode, Microsoft is its designated driver. The software giant is vying with retailer Amazon to be the planet\u2019s second-biggest firm by market capitalization, at nearly $730 billion. Its secret is dullness and durability: the predictability of Microsoft\u2019s earnings under boss Satya Nadella has helped the firm\u2019s stock outperform Apple, Alphabet and Facebook over the past five years.  Its quarterly results on Thursday show Microsoft is doing well. The company earned $7.4 billion, an increase of 35 percent over the same period last year. More importantly, customers continue to switch to cloud versions of Office and other business software, and buy increasing amounts of online services, storage and computing. Enterprise sales of Office 365 were up more than 40 percent, while revenue from the Azure cloud-computing platform rose over 90 percent.  Microsoft customers stick around for two reasons. One is that switching to rival products is hard. Enterprises are reluctant to go through the disruption of training workers on new software. The other reason is that Microsoft is fairly staid. A company that puts all its data on Amazon\u2019s Web Services unit risks getting locked in or suffering a disruption if that company\u2019s service goes temporarily out of service.  This reliability explains why the company\u2019s earnings multiple has steadily expanded under Nadella. Microsoft\u2019s shares now trade at 26 times estimated 2018 earnings, a premium to Apple, Alphabet and Facebook. Since he became chief executive in 2014, Microsoft investors have seen over a 28 percent annualized total return. They don\u2019t need to worry about smartphone sales, data-privacy scandals or downturns to internet advertising. It may not be the most exciting company, but Microsoft at least knows how to stay on the road.","532":"(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Wednesday said it had discovered cyber attacks directed at democratic institutions, think tanks and non-profit organizations in Europe and would offer a cyber security service to several countries to close security gaps.  The hacks occurred between September and December 2018, targeting employees of the German Council on Foreign Relations and European offices of The Aspen Institute and The German Marshall Fund, the company said here in a blog post.  Microsoft said it discovered the hacking through the company\u2019s Threat Intelligence Center and Digital Crimes Unit, and the hacks targeted 104 employee accounts in Belgium, France, Germany, Poland, Romania, and Serbia.  Hackers in most cases create malicious weblinks and spoofed email addresses that look legitimate, aiming to gain access to employee credentials and deliver malware, the company said.  Microsoft said many of the attacks originated from a group called Strontium, which the company has previously associated with the Russian government.  Strontium, one of the world\u2019s oldest cyber espionage groups, has also been called APT 28, Fancy Bear, Sofancy and Pawn Storm by a range of security firms and government officials. Security firm CrowdStrike has said the group may be associated with the Russian military intelligence agency GRU.  Germany\u2019s BSI federal cyber protection agency confirmed that Strontium, or APT 28, had been attacking a wide range of organizations in Germany and around the world for years, but said it had not seen a substantial increase in these activities.

REUTERS\/Charles Platiau\/File Photo  \u201cState-controlled groups like APT 28 are usually continually active,\u201d BSI said in response to a query from Reuters, adding it could not confirm a direct connection to upcoming elections.  German officials have blamed a number of hacks, including a 2015 attack on the lower house of parliament, on APT 28, and a German government spokesman last year said Berlin was \u201calmost certain\u201d the Russian secret service was behind the group. Russia has repeatedly denied such claims.  Aspen Germany said the latest attacks were unsuccessful, but it was taking steps to make sure staff members were trained to avoid even the most sophisticated efforts in an ever-present barrage of phishing and malware attacks.  \u201cThis is a wake-up call. In the run-up to May 2019 European elections, it is incumbent on all responsible players in European democracy to remain vigilant,\u201d it said in a statement.  The German Marshall Fund also said its systems were not compromised, but it would continue to work with Microsoft and others to identify and mitigate any security challenges.  No immediate comment was available from German Council on Foreign Relations.  Microsoft said it will offer its cyber security service AccountGuard to 12 new markets in Europe including Germany, France and Spain to help customers secure their accounts.

On Wall Street, a gain of 1.06% in Microsoft helped lift the Dow and kept the S&P 500 and Nasdaq slightly afloat as quarterly results topped expectations, powered by its cloud business.  Stocks received some modest follow-through to the plus side following Thursday\u2019s late rally after two influential Federal Reserve officials - New York Fed President John Williams and Fed Board of Governors Vice Chair Richard Clarida - laid out the case for quick action by the central bank to support the U.S. economy.  However, Williams\u2019 comments were later walked back, with the New York Fed saying the speech was not about potential action at the upcoming meeting.  That dialed back expectations to about 39% for a rate cut of half a percentage point at the Fed\u2019s July 30-31 meeting, according to CME\u2019s FedWatch tool. Markets see it as a certainty the Fed will cut rates by at least a quarter of a percentage point at the meeting.  \u201cMicrosoft is a sign that not all companies are suffering from the downturn we\u2019re seeing in manufacturing or the pressure from interest rates that\u2019s affecting financials,\u201d said Jeff Kleintop, chief global investment strategist, at Charles Schwab in Boston.  Earnings expectations for the S&P 500 have been trending upward recently and show growth of 1% for the second quarter, according to Refinitiv data. As recently as Tuesday, earnings were expected to show a decline for the quarter.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 85.45 points, or 0.31%, to 27,308.42, the S&P 500 gained 2.13 points, or 0.07%, to 2,997.24 and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.93 points, or 0.08%, to 8,214.18.  European shares closed slightly higher, having given up early gains of as much as 0.7%, as political turmoil weighed on Italian stocks after the country\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said he would meet coalition partner and leader of the 5-Star Movement Luigi Di Maio amid speculation that the increasingly unwieldy government might collapse.  The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.12% and MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.33%.  Despite Friday\u2019s advance, MSCI\u2019s index was poised to snap a six-week streak of gains.  The walk back in the dovish Fed comments helped the dollar recover from declines in the prior session, while the euro weakened as expectations of a rate cut by the European Central Bank as early as next week picked up steam.  The dollar index rose 0.33%, with the euro down 0.46% to $1.1223.  In oil markets, crude advanced but was off earlier highs after climbing roughly 2% amid rising tensions between the United States and Iran after a senior Trump administration official said the U.S. will destroy any Iranian drones that fly too close to its ships.  Prices pulled back, however, with Brent prices on track for their biggest weekly decline of the year and U.S. crude on pace for its biggest weekly drop in two months.  U.S. crude rose 0.81% to $55.75 per barrel and Brent was last at $62.68, up 1.21% on the day.","534":"July 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Thursday reported fourth-quarter revenue that beat analysts\u2019 estimates, powered by growth in its flagship cloud product Azure.
