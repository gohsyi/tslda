The drug, part of a class known as bispecific antibodies, is already approved for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) whose cancer has returned after treatment or did not respond to previous treatment, such as chemotherapy.  The expanded approval is for patients with \u201cminimal residual disease,\u201d meaning the presence of cancer cells below a level that can be seen under a microscope. Such patients, who can now be identified with new molecular testing, still have an increased risk of relapse.  The FDA approval marks the first time molecular tests are being used to identify patients for early intervention in order to prevent cancer from reappearing, said Gregory Friberg, head of oncology global development at Amgen.  In studies, four out of five patients with residual ALL showed no signs of the disease after a single cycle of Blincyto, he said. The drug can cause serious side effects including a potentially life-threatening inflammatory condition called cytokine release syndrome.  An estimated 5,960 Americans will be diagnosed with ALL this year, and around 1,470 will die from the disease, according to the National Cancer Institute.

REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann\/File Photo  ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis on Friday touted safety and efficacy of its biosimilar copies of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Remicade and Amgen Inc\u2019s Enbrel, citing a study it hopes will help convince doctors that switching from the original medicines is a viable alternative for treating autoimmune diseases.  The Swiss drugmaker said Zessly, its Remicade biosimilar, matched the original medicine for safety and efficacy at 54 weeks, including in patients who switched from the original. Switching from Enbrel to its Erelzi also did not impact efficacy and safety in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis at 48 weeks, it said in a statement.  Novartis\u2019s generics unit Sandoz is among companies producing cheaper biosimilar copies of some of the most lucrative drugs for autoimmune diseases, in hopes of capturing a share of sales. But it also must convince doctors that its versions are as effective as the original products, including for patients who switch.  \u201cIt is our hope that these studies will help healthcare providers and patients have confidence that switching to Zessly or Erelzi will continue to deliver the benefits they are receiving from their existing treatment,\u201d said Mark Levick, who heads development of biologic drugs at Sandoz.  Remicade and Enbrel each had peak sales of about $7 billion, though that have been falling as rival biosimilar makers including Novartis bring copies onto the market following patent losses.","6":"(Adds Regeneron comment, share price)  Oct 24 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc, looking to boost use of its potent cholesterol drug Repatha, has cut the medication\u2019s U.S. list price by 60 percent to $5,850, the biotechnology company said on Wednesday.  Repatha and rival drug Praluent from partners Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA were launched in 2015 at list prices of more than $14,000 a year.  Sales of both - injectable drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors that dramatically lower bad LDL cholesterol - have been constrained by onerous roadblocks to patient access by insurers looking to limit spending on the expensive drugs.  Amgen\u2019s move \u201cis clearly focused on helping patients afford the medicine at the pharmacy counter,\u201d said Murdo Gordon, the company\u2019s head of commercial operations.  He said the drug, which has been shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks in high-risk patients, needs to be affordable to patients on Medicare, the federal government\u2019s health plan for seniors.  Amgen and other drugmakers have assistance programs to cover co-pays and deductibles for patients covered by commercial insurance, but are barred by law from paying those costs for people on government-funded health plans.  The new $5,850 price is in line with the current net price Amgen gets after discounts and rebates to pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and health insurers, said Amgen spokeswoman Kristen Davis.  In May, Regeneron and Sanofi agreed with pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co to lower Praluent\u2019s price to between $4,500 and $8,000 in exchange for easier access for patients covered by the PBM\u2019s largest plan.  \u201cWe are glad to see that Amgen is following our lead in lowering the cost of PCSK9 inhibitors,\u201d Regeneron said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.  Express Scripts still lists Regeneron\u2019s drug as the preferred PCSK9 option under its largest plan, but said on Wednesday it may \u201cre-evaluate based on Amgen\u2019s update.\u201d  \u201cAmgen is taking an important step forward to help payers be better positioned to provide breakthrough medicines and help people achieve better outcomes,\u201d Express Scripts\u2019 Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in a statement.  Amgen estimates that 75 percent of Repatha prescriptions under Medicare are not filled due to high out-of-pocket costs.  Gordon said Amgen expects that with the new lower list price for Repatha, Medicare Part D plans will list the drug with a fixed co-pay, rather than require patients to cover a percentage of the drug\u2019s price as most now do.  He said nearly half of the 3.4 million Americans estimated to be eligible for treatment with Repatha are on Medicare. Currently, the drug is being used by around 50,000 patients worldwide, Amgen said.  \u201cIn the long term it is our hope that we can address more patient needs, leading ultimately to higher revenue,\u201d Gordon said.  Despite initial forecasts for multibillion-dollar sales, worldwide sales of Repatha totaled just $271 million in the first half of 2018. Sales of Praluent were $134 million in the same period.  Amgen said the new list price will take affect immediately for most Repatha sales, and said the drug sold under the original list price will be phased out by the end of 2020 in order to limit any disruption to existing contracts.  The company said it has been offering healthcare payers significant rebates this year in exchange for improved patient access to Repatha.  Gordon said Amgen may continue to offer rebates to some PBMs and insurers. \u201cIf plans are interested in moving to affordable, fixed co-pay tiers, we are not going to be slow to respond to them,\u201d he said.  Shares of Amgen, which fell 5 percent in regular trading, were little changed at $187.95 after hours.","7":"May 8 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc:  * FDA GRANTS FAST TRACK DESIGNATION FOR OMECAMTIV MECARBIL IN HEART FAILURE  * AMGEN - TOP-LINE RESULTS FROM GALACTIC-HF ARE EXPECTED IN Q4 2020 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","8":"(Reuters) - An experimental Amgen Inc drug that targets a specific genetic mutation shrank tumors in just one of 12 patients with advanced colorectal cancer who were given the highest dose in a small, early-stage trial, the company said on Saturday.  The cancer stopped growing in 10 of the patients taking 960 milligrams of AMG510 daily, while one patient had tumor progression, according to Phase I trial data presented in Barcelona at a meeting of the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO).  In addition, one of the 10 patients whose colon cancer had initially stabilized later left the trial after the disease worsened.  Amgen had previously reported a much higher response rate for AMG510 in lung cancer. The trial tested the drug against multiple tumor types.  AMG510 could become the first approved medicine targeting a mutated form of a gene known as KRAS. The mutation, KRASG12C, occurs in around 13% of non-small cell lung cancers, 3% to 5% of colorectal cancers and up to 2% of other solid tumor cancers.  Guggenheim analyst Michael Schmidt recently estimated that drugs targeting KRASG12C could reach annual U.S. sales of $3 billion and $6.4 billion worldwide.  Rivals, such as Mirati Therapeutics Inc, are also developing drugs that target KRAS mutations.  Amgen said it has not decided whether to move AMG510 into a larger Phase II colon cancer study as a monotherapy. The U.S. biotech does plan to begin a colon cancer trial this year testing the pill in combination with drugs known as MEK inhibitors that block a protein associated with tumor growth.  \u201cThe fact that we saw one response is encouraging,\u201d Greg Friberg, head of oncology development at Amgen, told Reuters, adding that \u201cadditional work in understanding mutational drivers is ongoing.\u201d  AMG510 is part of a growing trend of precision medicines that target specific gene mutations driving cancer regardless of the organ in which the disease originated.  Earlier this month, the company said AMG510 shrank tumors in about half of advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients in the trial. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted \u201cfast track\u201d status to the drug for lung cancer, which could hasten an eventual approval decision.  Early results appear to indicate that the drug is safe, with six out of 76 patients reporting diarrhea or anemia.  Amgen is also studying AMG510 in combination with Keytruda, Merck & Co\u2019s blockbuster immunotherapy, for treating lung cancer.","9":"Jan 30 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc on Thursday said its fourth-quarter sales fell 2% due to competition from lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars, but share buybacks enabled the company to post a profit that topped Wall Street estimates.  For 2020, the Thousand Oaks, California-based biotech company forecast earnings of $14.85 to $15.60 per share on revenue as high as $25.6 billion. Analysts are estimating 2020 adjusted earnings of $16.14 on revenue of $25.5 billion, according to Refintiv IBES data.  A company official attributed the difference to lower interest income and Amgen\u2019s recently acquired 20.5% stake in China\u2019s BeiGene Ltd, which is not yet profitable.  Amgen said fourth-quarter sales totaled $5.88 billion, down from $6 billion a year earlier. Total revenue fell 1% to $6.2 billion, ahead of the average analyst estimate of $6.06 billion.  Quarterly adjusted earnings per share rose 6% to $3.64, beating the average Wall Street estimate of $3.48. Net earnings per share fell 5 percent to $2.85 due to higher operating costs partially offset by a lower share count.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis is a chronic condition resulting from progressive bone loss beginning around menopause.  The monthly injection, Evenity, developed jointly with Belgium-based UCB SA, helps reduce the risk of fracture by increasing bone mass and mildly inhibiting the break down of bone minerals.  Evenity comes with a boxed warning, the FDA\u2019s strictest warning, flagging increased risk of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular-related death.  The approval is expected to augment sales at Amgen, which faces competition from cheaper rivals for two of its biggest selling products - the white blood cell booster Neulasta and rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel.  However, William Blair analyst Matt Phipps expects the initial demand to be slow due to the cardiovascular risks, and expects peak sales of $500 million.  \u201cIt\u2019s important to carefully select patients for this therapy, which includes avoiding use in patients who have had a heart attack or stroke within the previous year,\u201d Hylton Joffe, a director at FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said.  Amgen said the drug would be launched next week and it will unveil the price of the drug as well.  The decision comes months after an FDA panel overwhelmingly voted for the drug\u2019s approval.  Osteoporosis, most common in women who have reached menopause age, affects an estimated 8 million American women.  The market for such treatment is currently dominated by bone strengthening agents known as antiresorptive therapies, including Merck & Co\u2019s Fosamax, which block the normal process of break down of bone minerals. But they take years to get a substantial benefit.  Evenity, which belongs to a new class of drugs known as sclerostin inhibitors, is administered with two 105 mg injections every month for a year, followed by chronic therapy with an antiresorptive drug.","12":"LOS ANGELES, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc said on Thursday it will acquire a 20.5% stake in BeiGene Ltd in a deal that will enable the California-based biotechnology company to expand its presence in China, the world\u2019s second largest pharmaceutical market.  Amgen said it will pay around $2.7 billion in cash, or $174.85 per BeiGene American depository share, for the stake in BeiGene, which agreed to commercialize three Amgen cancer drugs in China. The two companies will also collaborate on development of Amgen\u2019s oncology pipeline.  Amgen and BeiGene will share profits for at least five years on Xgeva, which prevents fractures caused by cancer that has spread to the bone, as well as blood cancer drugs Kyprolis and Blincyto.  Under the deal, two of those drugs will revert to Amgen - one after five years and one after seven years. BeiGene can retain one product and will receive royalties on sales in China for an additional five years on the other two.  \u201cOne of our key priorities over the past few years has been to build the business out globally,\u201d Amgen Chief Financial Officer David Meline told Reuters. \u201cThis is really the remaining piece of that puzzle.\u201d  Meteoric annual growth at a high double-digits percentage rate in the Chinese pharmaceutical market vaulted it into second place behind only the United States. Since 2013, that growth rate has slowed significantly and is projected to decline to growth of 3% to 6% through 2023, according to Iqvia, which tracks pharmaceutical sales and global industry trends.  Still, western drugmakers such as AstraZeneca Plc have profited from partnerships with local players in China, as well as from a recent softening in the country\u2019s regulatory environment for pharmaceutical firms.  \u2018CLINICAL EXPERTISE\u2019  Beijing-based BeiGene has a 700-person commercial operation and a 600-person clinical development organization in China. The company also markets Celgene Corp\u2019s drugs in China.  The Amgen deal calls for BeiGene to contribute up to $1.25 billion to help develop 20 experimental cancer drugs in Amgen\u2019s pipeline. BeiGene would be entitled to royalties on sales of these products outside of China, if approved, with the exception of AMG510, a promising drug under development for lung cancer and other solid tumor cancers.  \u201cBeiGene\u2019s clinical expertise was a major component of the deal,\u201d Amgen research chief David Reese told Reuters. \u201cThey have clearly demonstrated that they can deliver on clinical trials to global standards.\u201d  For each pipeline drug approved in China, BeiGene will assume commercial rights in China for seven years, including for AMG510. After that period, BeiGene will retain rights to up to six of those products in China, excluding AMG510.  Earlier this year, Amgen began selling Xgeva and cholesterol-fighter Repatha in China. Both are available for cash-paying customers, and Amgen plans to seek their placement on the country\u2019s national reimbursement drug list, Chief Commercial Officer Murdo Gordon said.  Amgen said it plans to continue to commercialize its non-oncology product portfolio in China.  China last month expanded a pilot drug bulk-buying program, which was initiated last year, to the entire country in an attempt to negotiate lower prices from drug manufacturers.  Gordon acknowledged that inclusion on the program \u201cusually has a price-lowering requirement.\u201d  As part of the collaboration, Amgen will nominate one person to serve on BeiGene\u2019s board.  The companies said the transaction has been approved by both boards and is expected to close in early 2020, subject to BeiGene shareholder approval.

The drug, deucravacitinib, met both main goals of the study by reducing the extent and severity of psoriasis after 16 weeks of treatment in a far greater percentage of patients than in the group that received placebo.  A significantly higher proportion of patients receiving deucravacitinib achieved at least a 75% improvement in psoriasis as measured by a scale known as the Psoriasis Area Severity Index.  The drug also met a secondary goal of being more effective than Otezla in proportion of patients showing improvement at week 16.  A second late-stage trial comparing the drug to placebo and Otezla is currently underway, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021.  Psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune inflammatory disorder that results in sometimes painful, unsightly scaly and inflamed skin patches.

Since the drug\u2019s target population of older women has underlying risk for such cardiovascular problems, Wall Street analysts have pulled back on sales expectations for Evenity, which was developed jointly with Belgium-based UCB SA.

Sales of Amgen\u2019s older osteoporosis drug, Prolia, are forecast to reach $3.3 billion by 2024. Prolia does not build bone as Evenity does. It is designed to block a protein that activates bone-destroying cells called osteoclasts.

FILE PHOTO: An Amgen sign is seen at the company's office in South San Francisco, California October 21, 2013. REUTERS\/Robert Galbraith\/File Photo  Amgen said it will pay around $2.7 billion in cash, or $174.85 per BeiGene American depository share, for the stake in BeiGene, which will commercialize three Amgen cancer drugs in China. The two companies will also collaborate on development of Amgen\u2019s oncology pipeline.  \u201cChina is going to become a significant opportunity for new revenue,\u201d Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said in an emailed statement. \u201cIt makes a lot of sense to start building there early as Amgen has lots of products to commercialize there.\u201d  Shares of BeiGene, based in Beijing and Cambridge, Massachusetts, were up 25% at $173.10 in after hours trading, while Amgen\u2019s shares were flat at $213.25.  Amgen and BeiGene will share profits for at least five years on Xgeva, which prevents fractures caused by cancer that has spread to the bone, as well as blood cancer drugs Kyprolis and Blincyto.  Under the deal, two of those drugs will revert to Amgen - one after five years and one after seven years. BeiGene can retain one product and will receive royalties on sales in China for an additional five years on the other two.  \u201cOne of our key priorities over the past few years has been to build the business out globally,\u201d Amgen Chief Financial Officer David Meline told Reuters. \u201cThis is really the remaining piece of that puzzle.\u201d  He said the deal would modestly decrease Amgen\u2019s earnings in 2020.  Meteoric annual growth at a high double-digits percentage rate in the Chinese pharmaceutical market vaulted it into second place behind only the United States. Since 2013, that growth rate has slowed significantly and is projected to decline to growth of 3% to 6% through 2023, according to Iqvia IQV.N, which tracks pharmaceutical sales and global industry trends.  Still, western drugmakers such as AstraZeneca Plc AZN.L have profited from partnerships with local players in China, as well as from a recent softening in the country's regulatory environment for pharmaceutical firms.  \u2018CLINICAL EXPERTISE\u2019  BeiGene has a 700-person sales force and 600 employees in clinical development in China. The company sells in China drugs made by Celgene Corp CELG.O, which is being acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co BMY.N.  The Amgen deal calls for BeiGene to contribute up to $1.25 billion to help develop 20 experimental cancer drugs in Amgen\u2019s pipeline. BeiGene would be entitled to royalties on sales of these products outside of China, if approved, with the exception of AMG510, a promising drug under development for lung cancer and other solid tumor cancers.  \u201cBeiGene\u2019s clinical expertise was a major component of the deal,\u201d Amgen research chief David Reese told Reuters. \u201cThey have clearly demonstrated that they can deliver on clinical trials to global standards.\u201d  For each pipeline drug approved in China, BeiGene will assume commercial rights in China for seven years, including for AMG510. After that period, BeiGene will retain rights to up to six of those products in China, excluding AMG510.  Earlier this year, Amgen began selling Xgeva and cholesterol-fighter Repatha in China. Both are available for cash-paying customers, and Amgen plans to seek their placement on the country\u2019s national reimbursement drug list, Chief Commercial Officer Murdo Gordon said.  Amgen said it plans to continue to commercialize its non-oncology product portfolio in China.  China last month expanded a pilot drug bulk-buying program, which was initiated last year, to the entire country in an attempt to negotiate lower prices from drug manufacturers.

Weekly U.S. prescription data from IQVIA, an analytics provider to the life sciences industry, showed that Lilly\u2019s therapy Emgality claimed the largest share of first-time patients at 37.7 percent, for the first time outstripping Amgen\u2019s Aimovig, whose share dropped to 37.2 percent as of April 26. Teva came in at a 25.1 percent share, according to an analyst who reviewed the data.  While Amgen\u2019s therapy was the first to be approved for the U.S. market last May, Lilly has fought to gain more favorable insurance coverage by offering deep discounts. Those efforts appear to have paid off. Lilly is the only drugmaker in the class currently covered by all three of the leading companies that manage Americans\u2019 prescription drug benefits: Cigna Inc\u2019s Express Scripts, UnitedHealth Group\u2019s OptumRx and CVS Health.  \u201cMore new patients were started on Emgality than on Aimovig,\u201d Lilly Chief Executive David Ricks said in an interview on Tuesday at the company\u2019s headquarters in Indianapolis. \u201cIt\u2019s just one week. We\u2019ll count it a trend when it\u2019s many weeks,\u201d Ricks said.  The new migraine drugs are the first designed to prevent the debilitating headaches. Drugmakers predicted that millions of patients could benefit and Wall Street analysts forecast nearly $4 billion in sales in the coming years. But their approval within months of each other last year created a fierce battle for market share, prompting all three drugmakers to offer their treatments directly to patients for free until they gained insurance coverage.  Pharmacy benefits companies that manage prescription drug coverage for tens of millions of Americans were able to pit the manufacturers against each other in negotiations, arguing the therapies were virtually interchangeable and did not appear to improve upon the cheaper generic drugs already on the market, Reuters reported on April 29.  The next day, Lilly and Amgen reported migraine drug sales well below investor expectations. Ricks said nearly 50 percent of Emgality prescriptions in the quarter were provided at no cost to patients, similar to the proportion of giveaways from Amgen and Teva.  Ricks said Lilly is working to boost overall awareness of its migraine drug. Television commercials for Emgality encourage women \u2013 who are more prone to get migraines - to \u201cimagine what you can do with more migraine-free days.\u201d  Although there are no clinical trials directly comparing the three drugs, Lilly stresses in its conversations with doctors some claims that rivals cannot make. They include Lilly trial data of patients who get episodic migraines showing that 16 percent had no migraines on average in any given month. Overall, Emgality cut migraine days in half in three clinical trials, similar to Aimovig and Teva\u2019s Ajovy.  \u201cMigraine-free for a month. That\u2019s a compelling thing for doctors and for patients,\u201d Ricks said.  Lilly is focusing its marketing efforts on primary care practices and says it has encountered few health insurer restrictions on prescriptions written by primary care doctors instead of specialists.  The company is also pursuing approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of Emgality in cluster headaches, an extremely painful type of headache for which there are no effective treatments. Lilly hopes to launch it this summer. Teva had pursued the same use for Ajovy, but last month stopped testing after it found the treatment was unlikely to work.  In an interview last week, Teva CEO Kare Schultz said both Teva and Lilly have been gaining share with new customers, while Amgen\u2019s share of new patients has been sagging. Amgen said it is confident in the opportunity to grow new prescriptions of Aimovig \u201cgiven the huge unmet need in migraine.\u201d (Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; additional reporting by Michael Erman and Caroline Humer in New York and Tova Cohen in Tel Aviv Editing by Phil Berlowitz)","30":"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc AMGN.O on Thursday reported a better-than-expected second quarter profit and raised its full-year earnings forecast, and its chief executive pledged not to raise drug prices again this year.

FILE PHOTO: An Amgen sign is seen at the company's office in South San Francisco, California, U.S., October 21, 2013. REUTERS\/Robert Galbraith\/File Photo  Express Scripts told Reuters it is pressing them to forego the usual strategy of setting a high U.S. list price, then lowering the cost for health plans through hefty rebates. It is also seeking a refund if the drugs don\u2019t work within a defined timeframe.The shift could help Express Scripts and other pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) bring prices down, and deflect growing criticism of their role as \u201cmiddlemen\u201d in the drug supply chain.  The Trump administration and members of Congress have demanded that PBMs pass on more of the rebates they receive to consumers outraged over rising costs at the pharmacy counter. Many Americans now have health plans with higher deductibles or co-payments, making them responsible for more of their medical costs.  Express Scripts is advising drugmakers to take that shift into account as they launch a new class of migraine drugs.  \u201cIf your expectation is that you are not going to actually get that high list price, then don\u2019t do that to patients who have high co-pays,\u201d Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in an interview, describing his message to Amgen and its rivals. \u201cLet\u2019s be more balanced. Let\u2019s get back to where gross-to-net is not so different.\u201dAmgen\u2019s Aimovig is expected to be approved next month, followed by similar drugs from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Lilly that the companies say could benefit up to 4 million people in the United States.  Lilly has been pushing PBMs \u201cfor years\u201d to create contracts that take drug performance into account, Chief Executive David Ricks said when analysts asked about the Reuters story on a conference call to discuss quarterly earnings.  Ricks said he was happy that Express Scripts \u201cis now changing their view and support this kind of construct. We\u2019ll be happy to work with them on it.\u201d  The new injected therapies interfere with the function of a molecule involved in the processes that kick off a migraine, such as dilation of blood vessels in the brain.  Wall Street analysts expect Amgen to announce a list price of up to $10,000 per year for Aimovig once it is approved, setting the tone for competitors.  But Express Scripts and other PBMs restrict access to new drugs they deem too expensive, asking doctors to provide detailed evidence of why a specific patient may benefit, requiring the use of other drugs for a period of time or favoring cheaper rivals when available.  Drugmakers could face similar issues with the new migraine treatments, Miller said: \u201cShould they price these things too high they will probably not be able to achieve much market share.\u201d  Express Scripts is also pushing Amgen and its peers to refund two-thirds of the cost of a migraine drug if a patient stops treatment within 90 days because it didn\u2019t work or caused major side effects.  Such guarantees are becoming more prevalent for older drugs with competing products on the market, including diabetes and hepatitis C therapies. It would be unusual to introduce them for the first drug in an entirely new class of therapy.Amgen, which will market Aimovig in partnership with Novartis, declined to comment on talks with Express Scripts. Research chief Sean Harper said in a recent interview that payers share blame for the current pricing model.  Their demands for ever-larger rebates has forced manufacturers to use higher list prices as a benchmark, he said.  \u201cIt is a ridiculous situation that we are in,\u201d Harper said. \u201cNo one is paying the list price, but patients are exposed for a period of time\u201d until they pay off their insurance deductible.  Shares of Amgen, which will report quarterly results on Tuesday afternoon, fell 1 percent in midday trading. Lilly declined 0.5 percent.  TAKING OUT COSTS  Rising U.S. healthcare costs, the most expensive worldwide, are straining budgets for families, employers and government agencies. That has created new pressures within the industry to control costs.  To that end, Express Scripts has agreed to a buyout from health insurer Cigna Corp, while PBM rival CVS Health Corp plans to buy insurer Aetna Inc .  In interviews with Reuters, smaller PBM Abarca Health and insurer Highmark Health said they were adopting similar tactics to Express Scripts in negotiating coverage for the migraine drugs. CVS declined comment.  Teva said it was evaluating the pricing environment for its migraine drug. The stakes are high for Amgen, which has struggled to grow revenue in recent years.  The biotech company\u2019s last potential blockbuster, high-priced cholesterol treatment Repatha, has been stymied by PBMs who questioned its value compared to generic statins that cost $100 per year.  Repatha and rival Praluent, sold by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, launched in 2015 at list prices near $14,000 a year and were expected to be billion-dollar products. But Express Scripts and other payers have rejected most prescriptions written for the new medicines while awaiting proof that they lower the risk of death.  As a result, Repatha sales totaled $319 million last year, while Praluent had sales of $195 million.  \u201cIf Amgen and Sanofi had it to do over again, I think they would have priced at half the list price and made a whole lot more money,\u201d said Jason Borschow, chief executive officer at Miami-based Abarca.  Aimovig is far more effective at preventing migraines than current treatments, mainly low cost generic drugs. Recent studies have shown that Aimovig reduces episodic migraines by at least half in around 50 percent of patients.  The Food and Drug Administration is expected to decide on Aimovig by May 17. The agency\u2019s decision on Teva\u2019s treatment fremanezumab had been expected in June, but that may be delayed due to manufacturing issues. A ruling on Lilly\u2019s galcanezumab is expected later in the year.","32":"June 28 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc:  * AMGEN AND NOVARTIS PRESENT NEW DATA DEMONSTRATING LONG-TERM EFFICACY, SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY OF AIMOVIG\u2122 (ERENUMAB-AOOE) IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC AND EPISODIC MIGRAINE  * AMGEN - RESULTS FROM A ONE-YEAR STUDY IN CHRONIC MIGRAINE PATIENTS \u201cREINFORCED\u201d ESTABLISHED SAFETY AND EFFICACY PROFILE OF AIMOVIG IN LONG-TERM USE  * AMGEN INC - SAFETY RESULTS OF STUDY AFTER ONE YEAR WERE CONSISTENT WITH ESTABLISHED SAFETY PROFILE OF AIMOVIG IN PREVIOUS STUDIES  * AMGEN INC - EFFICACY DATA OF STUDY SHOWED SUSTAINED BENEFITS UP TO ONE YEAR  * AMGEN INC - AIMOVIG STUDY IS CONTINUING FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS OF TREATMENT Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Reuters.Briefs@thomsonreuters.com)","33":"FILE PHOTO: The company logo for pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 8, 2019.

The 48-week trial involved patients with severe asthma who required oral corticosteroids on top of the standard regimen, the drugmakers said in a joint statement, adding that the drug was compared against placebo.  Tezepelumab works by blocking a type of immune protein called thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP).

For an interactive on Otezla sales click:  Jeff Jonas, healthcare portfolio manager at Gabelli funds, said that a number of Amgen\u2019s current drugs face loss of patent protection and competition from biosimilar drugs, so the growth from Otezla would be welcome.  \u201cThis is an attractive product for them that fits more or less with their current portfolio,\u201d Jonas said. \u201cIt\u2019s an approved product with a good safety profile, so there\u2019s not a lot of risk.\u201d  Still, Jonas expressed some skepticism about Amgen\u2019s growth forecast for the drug, noting that new competitors, including Bristol-Myers\u2019 drug in development, are likely to eat into its market share.  Amgen said it expects the deal to produce tax benefits with a present cash value of $2.2 billion, reducing the actual deal total to $11.2 billion.  With respect to possible antitrust concerns about the purchase, Amgen said on a conference call that it feels very confident that it will be able to close the deal.  Bristol-Myers said most of the proceeds from the sale will go to pay down debt from the deal with Summit, New Jersey-based Celgene. It also increased a previously planned $5 billion accelerated share buyback to $7 billion.","35":"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc AMGN.O on Tuesday said its second-quarter revenue fell 3% due to more competition for its older off-patent drugs, but rising sales of newer medicines helped its results exceed Wall Street forecasts.

It had previously forecast $13.25 to $14.30 per share on revenue of $22 billion to $22.9 billion.  Sales of potent cholesterol fighter Repatha rose 3% to $152 million, below Wall Street estimates of $157 million. Sales of Amgen's new migraine drug Aimovig, which competes with similar new treatments from Eli Lilly LLY.N and Teva TEVA.TA, totaled $83 million for the quarter, beating the $77.4 million projected by analysts.  But sales of Neulasta, which fights infections by boosting white blood cells, fell 25% to $824 million, while sales of kidney drug Sensipar plunged 71% to $122 million as competition from cheaper generics and biosimilars increased.

FILE PHOTO: An Amgen sign is seen at the company's office in South San Francisco, California in this October 21, 2013 photo. REUTERS\/Robert Galbraith\/File Photo  The panel voted 16-1 in favor of the monthly injection developed jointly with Belgium-based UCB SA. The drug, Evenity, helps reduce the risk of fracture by increasing bone formation and inhibiting break down of bone minerals.  Three of the 19-member panel initially voted in favor of a different indication but one of them later said he meant to support the proposed use.  The panel, however, raised concerns of cardiovascular safety risks linked to the drug, which FDA staff reviewers on Monday had cited as the main reason for convening the panel meeting.  \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve adequately characterized cardiovascular safety ... I don\u2019t know the perfect solution but relying on observational data only post approval, I don\u2019t think, will help us answer this reliably,\u201d said panel member Pamela Shaw, who voted in favor of the drug\u2019s approval.  \u201cMy vote is relying on a high-quality post-marketing study.\u201d  Postmenopausal osteoporosis is a chronic condition resulting from progressive bone loss beginning around the time of menopause.  An estimated 8 million American women live with the condition, which puts them at an increased risk of fractures, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation.  Amgen had proposed approval with a boxed warning - the FDA\u2019s harshest - highlighting the heart safety risks associated with Evenity.  \u201cThe efficacy of the drug was superb. If I had to bet, I\u2019d bet that the cardiovascular issue would turn out to be spurious ... I hope (Amgen) will do a study that will get rid of the blackbox,\u201d said Glenn Braunstein, another member who voted \u201cyes\u201d.  Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said a boxed warning would still represent an over $500 million revenue opportunity worldwide for Amgen.  Eli Lilly and Co\u2019s osteoporosis drug Forteo brought in $1.75 billion sales in 2017 despite having a boxed warning.  Evenity, chemically known as romosozumab, belongs to a new class of drugs known as sclerostin inhibitors and is administered as an under-the-skin injection.  Amgen and UCB in 2017 received a complete response letter for the drug from the FDA, which requested data from an additional study to be included in their marketing application.  The FDA is not mandated to follow the recommendation of the panel, but generally does.","38":"FILE PHOTO: The company logo for pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 8, 2019.

Pharmacy benefits managers like Abarca act as middlemen in the drug supply chain, and negotiate discounts on drugs on behalf of health insurers. Depending on the discounts drugmakers are willing to provide, pharmacy benefits managers make decisions about which drugs to include in coverage plans.  Abarca said its new deal with Amgen will help health insurers save costs when patients discontinue the drug because of side effects or a lack of effectiveness.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG is seen at its headquarters in Basel, Switzerland January 25, 2017. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  The complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan comes as drugmakers move to build share in the large market for new treatments to prevent migraine headaches.  Aimovig, which won U.S. and European approvals last year, belongs to a new class of medicines that also includes Eli Lilly and Co\u2019s Emgality and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd\u2019s Ajovy.  Novartis called Aimovig a \u201crunaway success,\u201d used by about 210,000 patients in the United States and 20,000 elsewhere.  Roughly 39 million Americans suffer from migraine headaches, according to the Migraine Research Foundation. Global drug sales to treat migraines could total $8.7 billion by 2026, according to the GlobalData analytics firm.  Amgen, in an emailed statement, said it is seeking to terminate the collaboration agreements with Novartis and obtain damages, but termination would not be effective until the litigation is resolved.  In its complaint, Novartis said it has spent at least $870 million on Aimovig since it began collaborating in August 2015 with Amgen, which previously controlled rights to the drug.  Novartis accused Amgen of trying to back out of their collaboration agreements based on the pretext that the Swiss company\u2019s Sandoz unit was working with Alder Biopharmaceuticals Inc on a possible Aimovig rival.  \u201cThe program about which Amgen has complained is being terminated,\u201d Novartis said, and the lack of a breach means Amgen\u2019s April 2 notice terminating the collaboration agreements should be deemed void.  Novartis said that Sandoz this year amended its contract manufacturing agreement with Alder, agreeing to continue supplying Alder\u2019s drug only through 2023.  \u201cAmgen now wants to keep the Aimovig profits for itself and deprive Novartis Pharma of its contractual right to share in the product\u2019s success and recoup its significant investments,\u201d Novartis said.  The lawsuit seeks to enforce the companies\u2019 collaboration agreements and declare Amgen\u2019s purported termination void.  Alder said it is not a party to the pending litigation between Novartis and Amgen. \u201cSandoz is a separate entity who does contract manufacturing for many companies who would compete with an Amgen or whatever,\u201d Alder Chief Executive Robert Azelby told Reuters in a telephone interview.  RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note: \u201cWe see it as highly unlikely that Sandoz would breach its own agreement with Alder, and in such a case would owe Alder substantial compensation.\u201d  Azelby said Alder intends to keep all U.S. marketing rights for eptinezumab migraine treatment, but is looking for a partner to sell it in other parts of the world.  Novartis\u2019 U.S.-listed shares fell 0.8 percent to close at $94.22, while Amgen shares dropped 0.6 percent, closing at $192.33. Alder\u2019s shares fell 4.9 percent to close at $13.33.

Two additional pillars of Narasimhan\u2019s growth plans are Zolgensma, the gene therapy for rare spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and Aimovig, the migraine drug on which Novartis has partnered with Amgen.  Asked about two deaths of babies in Zolgensma trials, including one in Europe in January that investigators deemed \u201cpossibly related to treatment\u201d, Narasimhan said he did not anticipate an impact on the timing of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval decision, due by May 31.  The baby may have had pneumonia when it received a Zolgensma infusion, he said, and was diagnosed with five separate viral infections before dying of respiratory sepsis.  \u201cWhen you can\u2019t definitively prove one thing or another, the investigator is required to say there could be a potential contribution\u201d from Zolgensma, Narasimhan said. \u201cThat does not mean the investigational agent actually contributed.\u201d  A U.S. drug review group this month recommended Zolgensma should be priced below the $4-5 million level Novartis has pegged as the gene therapy\u2019s value.  \u201cWe\u2019ll of course take that into consideration,\u201d Narasimhan said of the still-undisclosed price tag.

The plant will use Amgen\u2019s new flexible and reconfigurable technology, part of the company\u2019s ongoing efforts to control costs. Because it will be built next to an existing plant, it will cost a little more than half the $300 million estimated by the company in January. It will create 150 new manufacturing jobs, or half the 300 initially forecast.  Amgen, headquartered in Thousand Oaks, California, said in January it would locate the new plant in the United States, due in part to a lower effective tax rate stemming from U.S. tax reform.  The company will also receive corporate tax incentives linked to job creation from Rhode Island, according to Governor Gina Raimondo. \u201cWe continue to advance the state of technology in biologics manufacturing,\u201d Esteban Santos, head of operations at Amgen, told Reuters in an interview. He said key elements of the new lower-cost technology include processes that yield a larger number of cells to produce biologic drugs, a smaller footprint that emits less carbon and uses less water and electricity.  The new plant will also use diposable plastic containers, instead of the steel vats of a traditional plant, to grow cells, which eliminates the need for complicated piping and wiring, requires less labor and makes it easier to change product lines.Construction time and operating costs for the next-generation technology are about half that of a traditional biotech manufacturing plant, according to Amgen.Biotech drugs like Amgen\u2019s osteoporosis treatment Prolia are antibody proteins designed to interact with the body\u2019s immune system to block the path of foreign, potentially damaging invaders. Drugs in this class, known as monoclonal antibodies, are produced from mammalian cells, often from hamsters, that are usually cultivated in large stainless steel vats. The new plant, which will employ about 150 people, is modeled after Amgen\u2019s Singapore facility, which opened in 2014 and is also set up to allow for faster, more efficient production than traditional biologics plants with fixed bioreactors. The existing Rhode Island plant employs about 625, according to Amgen. Amgen\u2019s largest manufacturing plant is in Puerto Rico.  The company in January projected a 2018 adjusted tax rate of 14 percent to 15 percent and said it planned capital investments of about $3.5 billion over the next five years, with 75 percent in the United States.","50":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amgen Inc on Monday lost its bid at the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a ruling that kept the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA cholesterol-lowering drug Praluent on the market, but the patent dispute among the rival drugmakers will continue in another trial.  FILE PHOTO: An Amgen sign is seen at the company's office in South San Francisco, California October 21, 2013. REUTERS\/Robert Galbraith  The justices declined to hear Amgen\u2019s appeal seeking reinstatement of a jury verdict it won against Regeneron and Sanofi in the dispute in which Amgen accused its rivals of infringing its patents relating to its competing drug Repatha and sought to block sales of Praluent.  Amgen had asked the justices to overturn a 2017 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that set aside the jury\u2019s verdict, nullified a ban imposed by a judge on Praluent sales and ordered a new trial. The sales ban was put on hold while the matter was on appeal, never taking effect.  Sanofi and Regeneron said in a joint statement they were pleased with the Supreme Court\u2019s action.  \u201cWe are confident that the law and the facts support our positions,\u201d the companies said, adding that they look forward to the next trial in federal court in Delaware that is scheduled to start on Feb. 19.  Amgen said in a statement it believed in the validity of its patents and was preparing for the new trial.  Praluent is an injectable drug approved by the FDA in 2015 to treat high cholesterol in patients whose cholesterol levels were not controlled by diet and statin treatment. It is created from antibodies that dramatically lower levels of \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol in the blood by blocking a certain protein.  Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen sued Regeneron and Sanofi in 2014. A jury returned a verdict in 2016 that Amgen\u2019s patents relating to Repatha were valid. Paris-based Sanofi and Tarrytown, New York-based Regeneron had stipulated that if the patents were valid Praluent had infringed them.  In January 2018, U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson in Delaware took the unusual step of ordering an end to sales of Praluent. Robinson found that, although having both drugs on the market would be in the public interest, Amgen\u2019s patent rights outweighed that concern.  Praluent and Repatha won U.S. approval to reduce LDL cholesterol and have been shown to lower the risk of heart attacks.

Aimovig competes with similar new migraine drugs from Eli Lilly and Co and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd for placement on pharmacy benefit plans, which typically demand discounts or rebates from the list price in exchange for coverage.  Amgen said Aimovig is the \u201csegment leader,\u201d accounting for 60 percent of prescriptions in its class at the end of the quarter. The company, which offers a free sample program for Aimovig, said the percentage of paid prescriptions increased to around 60 percent from around 50 percent in the fourth quarter.  Amgen commercial operations head Murdo Gordon, speaking on a conference call, said net prices for Aimovig should stabilize in 2019 since contracts with most commercial plans have been signed. But \u201cpeople are moving from one free trial offer to another,\u201d making it difficult to determine the number of patients taking Aimovig on a sustained basis, he said.  First-quarter sales of Amgen\u2019s kidney drug Sensipar fell 57 percent to $213 million, below the $353.4 million forecast by analysts. Amgen is litigating to keep U.S. generic competition for Sensipar at bay.  For the full year, Amgen said it now expects adjusted earnings per share of $13.25 to $14.30 on revenue of $22 billion to $22.9 billion, compared with previous forecasts of $13.10 to $14.30 per share and revenue of $21.8 billion to $22.9 billion.

Large sums are at stake, since Humira clocked up worldwide sales of $18 billion last year, of which around $4 billion came from Europe, and European healthcare administrators are eager to exploit the competitive situation to drive down drug bills.  The U.S. healthcare system, however, is not expected to see Humira biosimilars until 2023, due to a raft of patents protecting AbbVie\u2019s market position. That should keep Humira\u2019s global sales growing for the next four years, despite European losses, according to consensus analyst forecasts.  Humira, used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis and psoriasis, is not only a big cost-saving opportunity for health services, it is also the number one target for companies manufacturing biosimilars.  Two further copies of the medicine are expected to be launched shortly by Mylan and South Korea\u2019s Samsung Bioepis. A fifth Humira biosimilar from Boehringer Ingelheim, which the German company had planned to sell in Europe, has been held back due to patent litigation, a spokeswoman said.  Biosimilars are near-copies of original biotech medicines, but because such drugs are made in living cells they can never be wholly identical. As a result, they require more extensive testing than true generics, which adds to development costs.  For the moment, Amgen and Novartis are not disclosing the price they will charge for their Humira copies, although an Amgen official said there would be cost savings for patients, hospitals and health systems.  The pace of biosimilar use is likely to vary from country to country across Europe, as has been the case with earlier copies of antibody drugs such as Remicade and Enbrel - two rivals to Humira from Merck and Pfizer - and Roche\u2019s blood cancer drug Rituxan\/MabThera.  Scandinavian countries have a track record of early biosimilar adoption and Britain has set a target for 90 percent of new patients getting the \u201cbest value biological medicine\u201d within three months of the arrival of biosimilars and 80 percent of existing patients within 12 months.  In the case of Humira, UK health authorities told administrators earlier this year not to sign any new contracts that extend beyond Oct. 16 \u2013 the expiry date for Humira\u2019s primary European patent.","55":"The logo of Lilly is seen on a wall of the Lilly France company unit, part of the Eli Lilly and Co drugmaker group, in Fegersheim near Strasbourg, France, February 1, 2018.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The forecast marks a shift for 40-year-old Amgen, which still relies on the U.S. market for more than 75% of its sales, 30 years after it won U.S. marketing approval for its first drug, red-blood-cell-booster Epogen.\u201dChina and Japan are the second and third largest markets in our industry,\u201d Bradway said in an interview on Monday on the sidelines of the JP Morgan healthcare conference in San Francisco. \u201cIn the case of China, it is a rapidly growing market. ... Japan has an aging population and we expect that will be a growth market for us.\u201d  Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, California, late last year acquired a 20.5% stake in Beijing-based BeiGene Ltd in a deal to expand its presence in China.  In Japan, Amgen expects by the second quarter of this year to dissolve its current joint venture with Astellas Pharma Inc and begin for the first time to operate an independent marketing unit in that country.  Bradway said the Astellas venture is a model for what Amgen aims to do with BeiGene - \u201cwork on a basket of drugs together, then after a period of time, the rights would return to us.\u201d Under the deal, BeiGene can retain rights to one of Amgen\u2019s cancer products.  Bradway said Amgen drugs such as osteoporosis treatments Prolia and Evenity as well as potent cholesterol fighter Repatha are tailor-made for aging populations.  \u201cWhere there are therapies available to prevent disease, it makes sense for society to identify people who are at risk,\u201d Bradway said. \u201cThe alternative is to fix that which is broken.\u201d  Amgen, which is facing more U.S. competition for older biotechnology drugs for which \u201cbiosimilar\u201d versions are becoming available, needs new sources of growth.  Bradway said Amgen will announce its 2020 financial outlook on Jan. 30, when it presents fourth-quarter 2019 results. He said the company is unlikely to return to its previous pattern of issuing five-year financial plans, due in part to \u201ca much more uncertain environment.\u201d  In addition to biosimilar competition, pharmaceutical companies are grappling with backlash from politicians and consumers to the industry\u2019s practice of routinely hiking list prices, and then giving some of that money back to health insurers in return for preferential reimbursement terms.  For 2019, Amgen forecast that its global net sales prices would drop by a rate in the mid-single digits.  Bradway said Amgen continues to see growth in Europe, where product sales volumes are increasing by rates in the high-single-digits or low-double-digits.  As in most European countries, the governments of both Japan and China negotiate prices for pharmaceuticals paid for by state-operated health plans.  Bradway said Amgen does not currently have any of its drugs authorized for coverage on China\u2019s National Reimbursement Drug List, but the company does plan to apply to have drugs like Repatha and leukemia treatment Blincyto approved for inclusion.","57":"(Reuters) - An experimental Amgen Inc drug that targets a specific genetic mutation reduced tumor size in around half of advanced lung cancer patients given the highest dose in a small, early-stage trial, the company said on Sunday.  Out of 13 lung cancer patients taking a 960-milligram dose of AMG510, seven had tumors shrink by at least 30%, according to data presented in Barcelona at the World Conference on Lung Cancer. Cancer was stabilized in the other six high-dose patients.  Nine of the 13, or 69%, are still taking the daily pill. Two of the partial responders have died, and another left the study due to cancer progression. One patient with stable disease also died.  Patients who responded to the drug have been treated for a median of 15 weeks, but the median duration of response has not been reached, according to Greg Friberg, head of oncology development at Amgen.  He said one patient previously reported as free of lung cancer is being counted as a partial responder since cancer in lymph nodes or other tissue cannot be ruled out.  Thirty-four lung cancer patients are enrolled in the Phase 1 dose-ranging trial, but Amgen has moved only the highest dose into a mid-stage study. The trial enrolled patients with tumors carrying the targeted mutation whose cancer had worsened despite several previous treatments - including chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors.  Of the 23 lung cancer patients so far evaluated - at various doses of AMG510 - 11 had tumor shrinkage of at least 30%.  About a third of trial patients reported mild side effects. More serious side effects, diarrhea and anemia, were seen in 9%of patients and no one left the study due to toxicity, the company said.  Wall Street has taken a keen interest in the Amgen drug that could become the first approved medicine targeting a mutated form of a gene known as KRAS - one of the most common mutations found in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  NSCLC accounts for up to 85% of lung cancers, by far the leading cause of cancer death among men and women, according to the American Cancer Society.  AMG510 is part of a growing trend of precision medicines that target gene mutations driving cancer regardless of the organ in which the disease originated.  The targeted mutation, KRASG12C, occurs in around 13% of NSCLC cases, as well as 3-5% of colorectal cancers and up to 2% of other solid tumor cancers, including pancreatic.  Amgen plans to present Phase 1 AMG510 trial results for patients with colorectal cancer later this month at a separate meeting to be held in Barcelona, this one by the European Society for Medical Oncology.  The company is also enrolling patients in an early-stage study of AMG510 in combination with Keytruda, Merck & Co\u2019s checkpoint inhibitor designed to unleash the body\u2019s immune system to attack cancer cells.  Amgen said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted \u201cfast track\u201d status to AMG510 for previously treated NSCLC with KRASG12C mutation.  Rivals such as Mirati Therapeutics Inc are also developing drugs that target KRAS mutations, but Amgen\u2019s could be first to market.","58":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday set aside a jury verdict that found Amgen Inc patents on its cholesterol drug Repatha were valid, handing a victory to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA, which sells a rival drug.  The ruling from U.S. District Judge Richard Andrews in Wilmington, Delaware was the latest reversal of fortune in a long-running lawsuit in which Amgen is seeking to stop French drugmaker Sanofi and U.S. biotech Regeneron from selling their drug Praluent.  Repatha and Praluent won U.S. approval about two weeks apart in July of 2016. Both drugs dramatically lower \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol by blocking a protein known as PCSK9 that prevents LDL removal from the blood. The injected drugs were later shown to also cut the risk of heart attacks.  The judge, in setting aside the jury\u2019s verdict reached in February, said some patent claims by Amgen relating to antibodies targeting PCSK9 were invalid because they did not sufficiently disclose the Thousand Oaks, California-based company\u2019s claimed innovations.  \u201cIt has been our longstanding belief that all of Amgen\u2019s asserted U.S. PCSK9 patent claims are invalid, and we are pleased that today\u2019s decision reaffirms this,\u201d Sanofi and Regeneron said in a statement.  California-based Amgen said in a statement that it disagreed with aspects of the court\u2019s decision and will seek review by the appellate court.  \u201cProtecting intellectual property is critical to our business since it allows for our investment in the research and development of new medicines,\u201d Amgen said. \u201cConsequently, we are disappointed with today\u2019s decision, and we look forward to presenting our case to uphold the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d  Despite initial forecasts for multibillion-dollar sales, restrictions placed by insurers on use of the potent but expensive drugs have severely limited patient access and sales.  Repatha had worldwide sales of $152 million in the second quarter of 2019, while Regeneron reported Praluent sales of $73.7 million for the period.","59":"(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc\u2019s Retacrit was approved by U.S. health regulators as a biosimilar to current anemia treatments from Amgen Inc and Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday, setting it up to compete against more established brands.

Epogen\u2019s $1.10 billion in sales accounted for about 5 percent of Amgen\u2019s 2017 revenue, but analysts believe a competing product is unlikely to hurt the company.  \u201cIts nice to see that the FDA is moving along and approving biosimilars but the commercial impact to Amgen is quite minimal,\u201d Jefferies analyst Michael Yee, who has a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on Amgen\u2019s stock, told Reuters.  Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Procrit brought in sales of $972 million in 2017, accounting for 2.7 percent of its total sales.  The FDA has been pushing to approve copies of expensive branded drugs to increase competition in the market as the Trump administration rallies against exorbitantly priced medicines.  Biosimilars aim to copy biologic products, which are made inside living cells, but they can never be exact duplicates.  Tuesday\u2019s approval allows Retacrit\u2019s use as a treatment for a drop in red blood cells caused by chronic kidney disease, chemotherapy, or the use of zidovudine in HIV patients.  The biosimilar was also approved for use before and after surgery to safeguard against the need for red blood cell transfusions due to blood loss from surgery.

REUTERS\/Robert Galbraith\/File Photo  It also maintained its earnings forecast for the year, citing continued growth in sales of new drugs despite the ongoing pandemic.  Oral drugs like Otezla have benefited from coronavirus fears that have kept patients away from rival medicines that must by administered in doctors\u2019 offices or hospitals.  \u201cAlthough the first few weeks of April have clearly shown some signs of disruption, the combination of our results from the first quarter and our expectation of an improving outlook for global healthcare activity give us confidence\u201d in Amgen\u2019s existing 2020 forecasts, Chief Executive Bob Bradway said on a conference call.  The company expects 2020 adjusted earnings of $14.85 to $15.60 per share on revenue of $25 billion to $25.6 billion.  Otezla, which Amgen acquired last year from Celgene Corp as part of Celgene's buyout by Bristol Myers Squibb Co BMY.N, helps reduce overactive inflammation. Other similar medicines are also being tested to see if they can help COVID-19 patients.  Amgen expects to begin clinical trials of the drug for COVID-19 in the coming weeks, said research chief David Reese.  Amgen also said it is working with partner Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp ADPT.O to identify antibodies targeting the novel coronavirus that may be developed into a drug to potentially prevent or treat COVID-19.  Amgen\u2019s expertise in manufacturing biologic drugs at scale would enable it to supply large numbers of patients with any antibodies it develops, Reese said.  Amgen said strong first-quarter sales of Otezla, along with higher volume sales of drugs like cholesterol treatment Repatha, contributed to an 11% increase in revenue for the period.  The company last year launched a lower-priced Repatha option aimed at reducing out-of-pocket costs for Medicare patients.  Several other newer medicines also had double-digit percentage sales increases in the period.  \u201cWe are encouraged with the progress and minimal disruption from COVID-19 across the business,\u201d Credit Suisse analyst Evan Seigerman said in a research note.

Wall Street analysts, on average, had forecast $14.61 per share on revenue of $22.9 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Speaking on a conference call, Chief Financial Officer David Meline said Amgen faces headwinds in the form of competition for legacy products such as kidney drug Sensipar and rheumatoid arthritis treatment Enbrel as well as heightened U.S. focus on the issue of prescription drug affordability.  He said Amgen\u2019s 2019 outlook assumes its global net sales prices will drop by a rate in the \u201cmid-single digits\u201d after falling 1 percent in 2018.

That followed lower-than-expected initial full-year earnings outlooks from Johnson & Johnson and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co  However, Yee noted that Amgen has historically issued conservative financial forecasts at the beginning of the year, before raising them each quarter as actual results are reported.  The increase in Amgen\u2019s fourth-quarter sales was driven largely by demand for medicines such as cancer drug Kyprolis, cholesterol fighter Repatha and osteoporosis treatment Prolia.  Sales of new migraine drug Aimovig totaled $95 million for the quarter, nearly double the $50 million analysts had forecast. Aimovig was first to market among a new class of drugs designed to prevent rather than treat migraine headaches.","75":"ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis NOVN.S is betting on heart drug prospect inclisiran in a $9.7 billion takeover of The Medicines Co MDCO.O as it challenges cardiovascular medicines from Amgen Inc AMGN.O, Sanofi SASY.PA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals REGN.O.  FILE PHOTO: Switzerland's national flag flies in front of the logo of Swiss drugmaker Novartis in Basel, Switzerland, January 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann\/File Photo  Novartis is paying $85 per share in cash, a 24% premium over The Medicines Co\u2019s closing price of $68.55 on Friday, to acquire the U.S. biotechnology company\u2019s lone drug, the cholesterol-lowering injection inclisiran.  The deal shows Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan is ready to spend billions on not just rare disease treatments, as it did in 2018 when it paid $8.7 billion for gene therapy specialist AveXis, but also for cardiovascular medicines aimed at a market with potentially millions of patients.  Inclisiran, which still must win regulators\u2019 approval, is set to require twice-yearly injections by doctors, far less frequently than the 26-injection regimens of Amgen\u2019s Repatha and Sanofi\u2019s and Regeneron\u2019s Praluent cholesterol-lowering drugs.  \u201cWe believe that will lead to less patient abandonment,\u201d Narasimhan told investors on a call on Monday. \u201cPayers will have confidence knowing that physician administration will ensure patient compliance.\u201d  Novartis shares were seen up 0.2%, premarket indicators showed. JBPRE01  Repatha and Praluent, which similar to inclisiran aim to inhibit PCSK9 proteins that lead to elevated levels of bad LDL cholesterol in people with heart disease, have struggled to gain traction due a demanding dosing regiment as well as objections to their price, which makers have been forced to slash to less than $6,000 annually.  Narasimhan said he is confident that inclisiran can produce an attractive return on investment and contribute to sales starting in 2021, contingent upon regulatory approval and completion of the deal.  \u201cWe see returns well in excess of cost of capital,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Harry Kirsch said. Novartis plans to pay for with one-third cash and two-thirds long-term borrowings.  Inclisiran could become one of its best-selling medicines, Basel-based Novartis predicted, adding the transaction had been approved by the boards of both companies.  The acquisition would modestly dilute core earnings per share versus a no-deal scenario during the next few years, but should then be significantly accretive to group core operating income and core EPS in the medium term, Novartis said.  HEART DISEASE  Inclisiran, for use on top of statins by heart patients who struggle to lower their cholesterol levels with traditional therapy, is seen as complementing Novartis\u2019s growing business with its heart-failure medicine Entresto, which topped the $1 billion annual revenue threshold last year.  Narasimhan said the company can leverage the sales force it built up to help boost the initially slow Entresto sales to market inclisiran, too.  Novartis has historically had a strong cardiovascular drug franchise, but lost ground when Diovan, once a $6 billion-per-year seller, lost patent protection in 2012. It left the company without an immediate, innovative follow-up product.  The deal fits Narasimhan\u2019s target of acquisitions of up to $10 billion to bolster the group\u2019s portfolio of medicines with new products or technologies.  Novartis\u2019 hunt for deals comes as billions in revenue is under threat from upcoming patent expirations including on Lucentis, for macular degeneration, iron overload medicine Exjade and $3.3 billion-per-year MS drug Gilenya.  Still, Novartis said it is confident that new products including inclisiran will help bolster growth and profitability.  It expects to expand core operating income margins in its Innovative Medicines division to the \u201cmid-thirties\u201d in the near term and to the \u201cmid-to high-thirties\u201d in the medium term.","76":"May 17 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc:  * FDA APPROVES AIMOVIG\u2122 (ERENUMAB-AOOE), A NOVEL TREATMENT DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY FOR MIGRAINE PREVENTION  * AIMOVIG IS EXPECTED TO BE AVAILABLE TO PATIENTS WITHIN ONE WEEK Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","77":"July 11 (Reuters) - Novartis Ag:  * CO, AMGEN AND BANNER ALZHEIMER\u2019S INSTITUTE DISCONTINUE CLINICAL PROGRAM WITH BACE INHIBITOR CNP520 FOR ALZHEIMER\u2019S PREVENTION Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","78":"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc AMGN.O on Thursday forecast 2020 earnings well short of Wall Street estimates, sending shares of the largest U.S. biotechnology company down 2.5%.

For the fourth quarter of last year, Amgen said product sales fell 2% from a year earlier due to competition from lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars, but share buybacks reduced the number of shares outstanding, enabling the company to post a per-share profit that topped Wall Street estimates.  Sales for the quarter totaled $5.88 billion. Total revenue fell 1% to $6.2 billion, which was ahead of the average analyst estimate of $6.06 billion.  Quarterly adjusted earnings per share rose 6% to $3.64, beating the average Wall Street estimate of $3.48.  Net earnings fell 5% to $2.85 per share due to higher operating costs partially offset by the lower share count.  Sales of older drugs such as white blood cell booster Neulasta and kidney drug Sensipar fell sharply due to competition from cheaper versions. Neulasta was down 43% at $665 million and Sensipar sales were off by 76% at $107 million.  Sales of newer drugs like cholesterol fighter Repatha and migraine drug Aimovig rose. Repatha was up by 26% to $200 million, while Aimovig rose 3% to $98 million in the quarter.  Amgen said it bought back around 6% of its outstanding shares last year.

Express Scripts told Reuters it is pressing them to forego the usual strategy of setting a high U.S. list price, then lowering the cost for health plans through hefty rebates. It is also seeking a refund if the drugs don\u2019t work within a defined timeframe.  The shift could help Express Scripts and other pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) bring prices down, and deflect growing criticism of their role as \u201cmiddlemen\u201d in the drug supply chain.

Wall Street analysts expect Amgen to announce a list price of up to $10,000 per year for Aimovig once it is approved, setting the tone for competitors.  But Express Scripts and other PBMs restrict access to new drugs they deem too expensive, asking doctors to provide detailed evidence of why a specific patient may benefit, requiring the use of other drugs for a period of time or favoring cheaper rivals when available.  Drugmakers could face similar issues with the new migraine treatments, Miller said: \u201cShould they price these things too high they will probably not be able to achieve much market share.\u201d  Express Scripts is also pushing Amgen and its peers to refund two-thirds of the cost of a migraine drug if a patient stops treatment within 90 days because it didn\u2019t work or caused major side effects.

It would be unusual to introduce them for the first drug in an entirely new class of therapy.  Amgen, which will market Aimovig in partnership with Novartis, declined to comment on talks with Express Scripts. Research chief Sean Harper said in a recent interview that payers share blame for the current pricing model.

That has created new pressures within the industry to control costs.

In interviews with Reuters, smaller PBM Abarca Health and insurer Highmark Health said they were adopting similar tactics to Express Scripts in negotiating coverage for the migraine drugs. CVS declined comment.  Teva said it was evaluating the pricing environment for its migraine drug. Officials at Lilly did not respond to a request for comment.  The stakes are high for Amgen, which has struggled to grow revenue in recent years.  The biotech company\u2019s last potential blockbuster, high-priced cholesterol treatment Repatha, has been stymied by PBMs who questioned its value compared to generic statins that cost $100 per year.  Repatha and rival Praluent, sold by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, launched in 2015 at list prices near $14,000 a year and were expected to be billion-dollar products. But Express Scripts and other payers have rejected most prescriptions written for the new medicines while awaiting proof that they lower the risk of death.  As a result, Repatha sales totaled $319 million last year, while Praluent had sales of $195 million.  \u201cIf Amgen and Sanofi had it to do over again, I think they would have priced at half the list price and made a whole lot more money,\u201d said Jason Borschow, chief executive officer at Miami-based Abarca.

(Reporting By Deena Beasley Editing by Bill Berkrot)","83":"INDIANAPOLIS (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co has pulled ahead in a three-way race with Amgen Inc and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd in attracting new patients to a new class of migraine drugs, and seeks to build on that advantage by stressing that its therapy can completely prevent headaches in a small percentage of patients.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Weekly U.S. prescription data from IQVIA, an analytics provider to the life sciences industry, showed that Lilly\u2019s therapy Emgality claimed the largest share of first-time patients at 37.7 percent, for the first time outstripping Amgen\u2019s Aimovig, whose share dropped to 37.2 percent as of April 26. Teva came in at a 25.1 percent share, according to an analyst who reviewed the data.  While Amgen\u2019s therapy was the first to be approved for the U.S. market last May, Lilly has fought to gain more favorable insurance coverage by offering deep discounts. Those efforts appear to have paid off. Lilly is the only drugmaker in the class currently covered by all three of the leading companies that manage Americans\u2019 prescription drug benefits: Cigna Inc\u2019s Express Scripts, UnitedHealth Group\u2019s OptumRx and CVS Health.  \u201cMore new patients were started on Emgality than on Aimovig,\u201d Lilly Chief Executive David Ricks said in an interview on Tuesday at the company\u2019s headquarters in Indianapolis. \u201cIt\u2019s just one week. We\u2019ll count it a trend when it\u2019s many weeks,\u201d Ricks said.  The new migraine drugs are the first designed to prevent the debilitating headaches. Drugmakers predicted that millions of patients could benefit and Wall Street analysts forecast nearly $4 billion in sales in the coming years. But their approval within months of each other last year created a fierce battle for market share, prompting all three drugmakers to offer their treatments directly to patients for free until they gained insurance coverage.  Pharmacy benefits companies that manage prescription drug coverage for tens of millions of Americans were able to pit the manufacturers against each other in negotiations, arguing the therapies were virtually interchangeable and did not appear to improve upon the cheaper generic drugs already on the market, Reuters reported on April 29.  The next day, Lilly and Amgen reported migraine drug sales well below investor expectations. Ricks said nearly 50 percent of Emgality prescriptions in the quarter were provided at no cost to patients, similar to the proportion of giveaways from Amgen and Teva.  Ricks said Lilly is working to boost overall awareness of its migraine drug. Television commercials for Emgality encourage women \u2013 who are more prone to get migraines - to \u201cimagine what you can do with more migraine-free days.\u201d Although there are no clinical trials directly comparing the three drugs, Lilly stresses in its conversations with doctors some claims that rivals cannot make. They include Lilly trial data of patients who get episodic migraines showing that 16 percent had no migraines on average in any given month. Overall, Emgality cut migraine days in half in three clinical trials, similar to Aimovig and Teva\u2019s Ajovy.  \u201cMigraine-free for a month. That\u2019s a compelling thing for doctors and for patients,\u201d Ricks said.  Lilly is focusing its marketing efforts on primary care practices and says it has encountered few health insurer restrictions on prescriptions written by primary care doctors instead of specialists.  The company is also pursuing approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of Emgality in cluster headaches, an extremely painful type of headache for which there are no effective treatments. Lilly hopes to launch it this summer. Teva had pursued the same use for Ajovy, but last month stopped testing after it found the treatment was unlikely to work.  In an interview last week, Teva CEO Kare Schultz said both Teva and Lilly have been gaining share with new customers, while Amgen\u2019s share of new patients has been sagging. Amgen said it is confident in the opportunity to grow new prescriptions of Aimovig \u201cgiven the huge unmet need in migraine.\u201d","84":"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc AMGN.O on Wednesday said third-quarter adjusted profit rose 17% due to stronger sales of drugs such as osteoporosis treatment Prolia and psoriasis medication Otezla, bucking challenges from lower drug prices and COVID-19.

The company raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to $15.80 to $16.15 per share, from a previous range of $15.10 to $15.75, and narrowed its revenue estimate. It now expects revenue of $25.1 billion to $25.5 billion versus it prior forecast of $25.0 billion to $25.6 billion.  The company reported a third-quarter adjusted profit $4.37 per share, beating the average estimate of $3.81 per share, as compiled by Refinitiv.  Revenue for the quarter rose 12% to $6.4 billion, in line with analyst estimates of $6.38 billion.  Sales of Prolia rose 11% to $701 million, ahead of the average analyst estimate of $688 million.  Psoriasis drug Otezla, acquired from Celgene Corp in November, had sales of $538 million for the quarter. Amgen said Otezla is expected to maintain its double-digit year-on-year volume growth trend, adding that as an oral pill, it is less affected by COVID-19.  Sales of Amgen\u2019s older arthritis drug Enbrel fell 3% year-on-year to $1.3 billion as the drug continued to lose market share in the quarter.  Amgen posted net income of $2.02 billion, or $3.43 per share, compared with a profit of $1.97 billion, or $3.27 a share, a year ago.","85":"April 2 (Reuters) - Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp:  * AMGEN AND ADAPTIVE BIOTECHNOLOGIES ANNOUNCE STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP TO DEVELOP A THERAPEUTIC TO PREVENT OR TREAT COVID-19  * ADAPTIVE BIOTECHNOLOGIES CORP - COMPANIES WILL BEGIN WORK IMMEDIATELY  * ADAPTIVE BIOTECHNOLOGIES CORP - TERMS OF AGREEMENT ARE NOT BEING DISCLOSED.  * ADAPTIVE - WILL EXTEND HIGH THROUGHPUT PLATFORM TO SCREEN MASSIVE GENETIC DIVERSITY OF B CELL RECEPTORS FROM PEOPLE THAT HAVE RECOVERED FROM COVID-19 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","86":"A federal appeals court on Friday denied a bid by Roche Holdings subsidiary Genentech Inc to block Amgen Inc from selling its cancer drug Kanjinti, a biosimilar version of Genentech\u2019s blockbuster medicine Herceptin.

The biotechnology company also posted much higher-than-expected adjusted profit, but acquisition-related costs pushed net earnings lower.  Amgen said sales of drugs such as osteoporosis treatment Prolia fell during the quarter as people, especially older women who use the physician-administered drug, put off going to the doctor due to the coronavirus pandemic. Sales rose for newer products including Otezla and cholesterol drug Repatha.  Total revenue for the quarter of $6.2 billion was in line with the average Wall Street estimate as compiled by Refinitiv.  Otezla, acquired from Celgene in November, had sales of $561 million for the quarter, beating analyst expectations of $540 million.  The psoriasis drug is being studied as a potential immune system-modulating treatment in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.  Amgen\u2019s net income for the quarter fell 17% from a year earlier to $1.8 billion, driven primarily by costs associated with the Otezla deal and accounting for losses at Chinese partner BeiGene Ltd.  Adjusted earnings rose 4% to $2.52 billion, or $4.25 per share. Wall Street analysts on average, expected $3.84 per share.  For the full year, Amgen narrowed its outlook for adjusted earnings per share to between $10.73 and $11.43 from its previous range of $10.65 to $11.45. The company said it still expects full-year revenue of $25 billion to $25.6 billion.

Six patients were still responding at 7.5 months of follow-up, according to research presented in San Diego at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology.  Amgen also said that AMG420, which targets a protein linked to multiple myeloma known as BCMA, has been given fast track status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  \u201cBased on these data, we plan to open an expanded trial,\u201d David Reese, Amgen\u2019s head of research and development, said in an interview. \u201cWe want to begin exploring quickly enrollment in earlier lines of therapy.\u201d  The Amgen bispecific antibody is designed to attach to a cancer cell and an immune cell, bringing them together so the body\u2019s immune system can kill the cancer.  Other companies are exploring different ways to attack the same BCMA target, including bluebird bio Inc and Johnson & Johnson.  Earlier at the ASH meeting, bluebird and partner Celgene Corp presented early trial data showing that experimental cell therapy bb21217 induced responses in 10 out of 12 heavily pretreated myeloma patients.  Bb21217 is a next generation version of bb2121, the companies\u2019 more advanced, but still experimental therapy in a class called CAR-T that requires harvesting a patient\u2019s own disease-fighting T-cells, modifying them in a laboratory so they target specific proteins on cancer cells and infusing them back into the patient. The manufacturing process for bb21217 is designed to improve the persistence of the altered cells.  Amgen has suggested the \u201coff the shelf\u201d nature of its antibody could be an advantage from both a clinical and commercial standpoint, but oncologists say more data is needed.  Trial patients are hospitalized for their first cycle of AMG420, after which they receive the drug by continuous 24-hour infusion for four weeks, followed by two weeks off therapy, for up to 10 cycles.  Amgen is working on another BCMA-targeting antibody that would last longer in the body, requiring less frequent infusions, but that research is at an earlier stage.  In the current study, 42 patients with multiple myeloma that worsened after at least two prior treatments were given AMG420 at varying doses - the highest dose was discontinued due to toxicity. A total of 13 patients responded to the treatment, including seven who achieved remission.  Serious side effects included nerve damage, infections, and liver failure. Of the 20 patients with serious adverse events, 17 required hospitalization and four had prolonged hospitalization.

FILE PHOTO - An Amgen sign is seen at the company's office in South San Francisco, California, U.S. on October 21, 2013.

Amgen said it expects to continue volume-driven growth as it launches new products including migraine drug Aimovig, which is likely to get U.S. regulatory approval next month. The nation\u2019s largest manager of prescription benefits, Express Scripts, told Reuters it is pressing Amgen and rival migraine drugmakers to reconsider the usual strategy of high list prices and hefty rebates. [L1N1S11CE]  Amgen believes Aimovig has advantages over other migraine drugs and expects a \u201cbolus\u201d of patients once it is approved, Anthony Hooper, the company\u2019s head of commercial operations, said on a conference call with investors.  The biotech company slightly raised the lower end of its full-year financial outlook, and said its adjusted tax rate would be 13.5 percent to 14.5 percent, or half a point less than previously expected.  Amgen posted first-quarter adjusted earnings of $3.47 per share, up from $3.15 a share a year earlier, helped by lower taxes and fewer outstanding shares. Analysts on average expected $3.23 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  First-quarter revenue rose 2 percent to $5.55 billion, with sales up 3 percent to $5.34 billion.  Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said the results marked \u201ca good quarter and a good start to the year\u201d for Amgen, while noting that expectations for large-cap biotechnology companies were low after weak performance so far this year as investors see a lack of meaningful catalysts to boost shares.  Amgen\u2019s sales of anti-inflammatory drug Enbrel, faced with more competition in the rheumatology and dermatology sectors, fell 6 percent to $1.05 billion, below Wall Street estimates of $1.09 billion.

It raised the lower end of 2018 revenue guidance to $21.9 billion from $21.8 billion and left the upper end unchanged at $22.8 billion.","92":"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc\u2019s push to get patients on its new $575 a month migraine drug before competition emerges in September is facing barriers from insurers.  Amgen Inc's headquarters building is seen in Thousand Oaks, California, U.S., in 2016 released July 24, 2018. Courtesy Amgen Inc.\/Handout via REUTERS  Bracing for a flood of costly prescription claims for the drug, Aimovig, large insurers such as Anthem Inc have set requirements for patients to document how they suffer from a defined number of headaches each month, and show that they have tried older migraine drugs first.  Others have made it even harder.  Plans including Blue Cross\/Blue Shield in Florida, Pennsylvania and Kansas confirmed with Reuters that they will only cover prescriptions from - or in consultation with - a neurologist or headache specialist, and specifically a member of the United Council for Neurologic Subspecialties.  Only around three percent of U.S. neurologists have such certification, and they are spread unevenly around the country. Florida and Pennsylvania, for example, each have a couple dozen, mostly in or near cities. Kansas has none at all, although there are three in the Missouri side of Kansas City.  The migraine injection from Amgen, with partner Novartis AG, is the newest front in the battle by payors to control costs amid high patient demand for pricey new drugs. New medicines are expected to triple the migraine market to $8 billion a year, mostly paid for by employers and the government.  In the wake of public pressure from President Donald Trump, drugmakers including Pfizer Inc, Merck & Co Inc and Novartis have in recent weeks rolled back planned list price hikes, or pledged to refrain from raising prices.  Amgen, which will report quarterly results on Thursday, is relying on new medicines like Aimovig to offset declining sales of older products beginning to face competition from biosimilar versions.  Aimovig has been shown to significantly reduce migraine frequency in about half of patients. Current migraine treatments are inexpensive generics or over-the-counter pills that might have side effects, or provide only partial relief for many patients.  In May, Amgen and Novartis were the first to win approval for the new type of migraine drug designed to interfere with a chemical involved in processes that kick off the severe headaches. Headache specialists say the new therapy should help validate migraine - a predominantly female disorder - as a debilitating disease with biological causes.  Four other companies - Eli Lilly & Co, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Allergan and Alder Biopharmaceuticals - are all working on potential rivals. The FDA is slated to decide in September on new drug applications from Lilly and Teva.  In the meantime, Amgen is trying to increase Aimovig prescriptions by giving all new patients two free 30-day samples. After that, people with commercial insurance can get up to 12 months free while their coverage is sorted out.  \u201cPatients are coming out of the woodwork now to get this new medication,\u201d said Dr. David Dodick, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona and chairman of the American Migraine Foundation, echoing what other doctors around the country told Reuters about strong demand for the injection.  BARRIERS TO ENTRY  Express Scripts, the nation\u2019s largest manager of prescription benefits, earlier this year urged Amgen to forego the usual drugmaker strategy of setting a high list price, then lowering the cost for health plans through rebates, Reuters reported.  Aimovig\u2019s $6,900-a-year price came in lower than many had expected, and the pharmacy benefit manager now lists Aimovig as a preferred migraine treatment on its largest formulary -requiring that patients first try two older preventive therapies and a triptan, a family of generic drugs used to treat acute migraine.  Express Scripts has Aimovig in the same category as Botox, Allergan Plc\u2019s anti-wrinkle injection approved for preventing migraine in patients suffering from 15 or more headaches a month.  Anthem Inc, the second largest U.S. health insurer, said its affiliated employer-sponsored health plans cover Aimovig with prior authorization and proof that patients have tried other therapy, but do not require prescriptions from board-certified neurologists.  OptumRx, the UnitedHealth Group group unit that manages prescription drug coverage for the largest U.S. health insurer, covers Aimovig if patients have a certain number of headaches each month, have first tried older drugs and get their prescription from a neurologist or pain specialist, according to its prior authorization form. Officials at UnitedHealth did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation.  The No. 3 health insurer Aetna Inc said it is still conducting its clinical policy process for Aimovig and will be determining coverage in the next few weeks.  For patients with commercial insurance already covering Aimovig, Amgen has a program that keeps the monthly co-pay at $5. But that assistance, seen by some as promoting the use of higher-cost drugs, is not allowed for government-sponsored plans including Medicare and Medicaid.  Amgen also has a \u201cSafety Net Foundation\u201d for uninsured or low-income patients whose insurance plans exclude Aimovig.  Dr. Matthew Robbins, chief of neurology at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, said he sees many patients who are struggling financially and wonders, \u201cwhen the two free months are up, are they going to have to come off of the drug? The co-pays are too expensive.\u201d  Prime Therapeutics, which manages prescription benefits for Blue Cross\/Blue Shield plans in several states covering 27 million members, said the final status of its coverage policy will be determined at a September meeting of its pharmacy and therapeutics committee.  Highmark Health, which insures about 5 million people in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Delaware, requires Aimovig to be prescribed by or in consultation with a neurologist or headache specialist, but does not stipulate that they have a specific subspecialty certification.  The challenges have competing drugmakers already talking with insurers about price and coverage terms.  \u201cWe are in discussions with every major PBM and payer right now ... to achieve the right level of access and affordability at the time of launch,\u201d said Wei-Li Shao, vice president of neurosciences at Eli Lilly.  Teva said its drug will be priced competitively \u201cbased on market dynamics.\u201d  Allergan Chief Commercial Officer Bill Meury said he does not expect the company\u2019s oral drug to be priced at a premium to rival injection medicines.  \u201cWe want to make our medications ... affordable so that health insurers place them on formulary,\u201d he said.  On its website, Optum says it will evaluate all of the new migraine drugs, then \u201cleverage them against each other for the best possible financial arrangement.\u201d","93":"March 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday expanded the use of Amgen Inc\u2019s leukemia drug Blincyto to include patients who are in remission but still have residual signs of the disease.

The expanded approval is for patients with \u201cminimal residual disease,\u201d meaning the presence of cancer cells below a level that can be seen under a microscope.

FILE PHOTO: An Amgen sign is seen at the company's office in South San Francisco, California in this October 21, 2013 file photo. REUTERS\/Robert Galbraith\/Files\/File Photo  Repatha and rival drug Praluent from partners Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA were launched in 2015 at list prices of more than $14,000 a year.  Sales of both - members of a class known as PCSK9 inhibitors that dramatically lower bad LDL cholesterol - have been constrained by onerous roadblocks to patient access by insurers looking to limit spending on the expensive drugs.  Amgen\u2019s move \u201cis clearly focused on helping patients afford the medicine at the pharmacy counter,\u201d said Murdo Gordon, the company\u2019s head of commercial operations.  He said the drug, which has been shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks in high-risk patients, needs to be affordable to patients on Medicare, the federal government\u2019s health plan for seniors.  Amgen and other drugmakers have assistance programs to cover co-pays and deductibles for patients covered by commercial insurance, but are barred by law from paying those costs for people on government-funded health plans.  The new $5,850 price is in line with the current net price Amgen gets after discounts and rebates to pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and health insurers, said Amgen spokeswoman Kristen Davis.  In May, Regeneron and Sanofi agreed with pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co to lower Praluent\u2019s price to between $4,500 and $8,000 in exchange for easier access for patients covered by the PBM\u2019s largest plan.  Express Scripts still lists Regeneron\u2019s drug as the preferred PCSK9 option under that plan, but said on Wednesday it may \u201cre-evaluate based on Amgen\u2019s update.\u201d  \u201cAmgen is taking an important step forward to help payers be better positioned to provide breakthrough medicines and help people achieve better outcomes,\u201d Express Scripts\u2019 Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in a statement.  Amgen estimates that 75 percent of Repatha prescriptions for Medicare patients are not filled due to high out-of-pocket costs.  Gordon said Amgen expects that with the new lower list price for Repatha, Medicare Part D plans will list the drug with a fixed co-pay, rather than require patients to cover a percentage of the drug\u2019s price as most now do.  He said nearly half of the 3.4 million Americans estimated to be eligible for treatment with Repatha are on Medicare. Currently, the drug is being used by around 50,000 patients worldwide, Amgen said.  \u201cIn the long term it is our hope that we can address more patient needs, leading ultimately to higher revenue,\u201d Gordon said.  Despite initial forecasts for multibillion-dollar sales, worldwide sales of Repatha totaled just $271 million in the first half of 2018. Sales of Praluent were $134 million in the same period.  Amgen said the new list price will take affect immediately for most Repatha sales, and said the drug sold under the original list price will be phased out by the end of 2020 in order to limit any disruption to existing contracts.  The company said it has been offering healthcare payers significant rebates this year in exchange for improved patient access to Repatha.  Gordon said Amgen may continue to offer rebates to some PBMs and insurers. \u201cIf plans are interested in moving to affordable, fixed co-pay tiers, we are not going to be slow to respond to them,\u201d he said.","96":"March 26 (Reuters) - Coherus Biosciences Inc:  * COHERUS BIOSCIENCES-U.S. COURT ADOPTED MAGISTRATE JUDGE BURKE\u2019S REPORT & RECOMMENDATION TO GRANT MOTION OF CO TO DISMISS PATENT INFRINGEMENT COMPLAINT  * COHERUS BIOSCIENCES SAYS PATENT INFRINGEMENT COMPLAINT AGAINST CO WAS FILED BY AMGEN INC & AMGEN MANUFACTURING LIMITED - SEC FILING  * COHERUS BIOSCIENCES - PATENT INFRINGEMENT COMPLAINT WAS DISMISSED ON GROUNDS THAT COMPLAINT FAILED TO STATE CLAIM UPON WHICH RELIEF MAY BE GRANTED Source text: (bit.ly\/2pDyhcg) Further company coverage:","97":"April 7 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc:  * AMGEN - TOTAL COMPENSATION FOR CEO ROBERT BRADWAY WAS $19.6 MILLION IN 2019 VERSUS $18.6 MILLION IN 2018  * AMGEN - FOR 2019, RATIO OF ANNUAL TOTAL COMPENSATION OF CEO TO THAT OF MEDIAN STAFF MEMBER WAS 150 TO 1  * AMGEN - BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE \u201cAGAINST\u201d STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL TO REQUIRE INDEPENDENT BOARD CHAIR Source: bit.ly\/2XkdziX Further company coverage:","98":"Aug 9 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday said patents relating to the Amgen Inc\u2019s blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel were valid, denying a challenge by Novartis AG, which is seeking to launch a copycat version.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The department said Japan-based Astellas Pharma and Amgen Inc, the world\u2019s largest biotechnology company, were the latest to settle claims stemming from an industry-wide probe of drugmakers\u2019 financial support of patient assistance charities.  Astellas will pay $100 million while Amgen will pay $24.75 million, the department said. Neither company admitted wrongdoing.  Amgen in a statement said it did not agree that its conduct was inappropriate but settled to put the matter behind it. Astellas also said it believed its actions were lawful.  The investigation, led by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Boston, came amid growing attention to soaring U.S. drug prices. Copays are partly meant to serve as a check on healthcare expenses by exposing patients to some of a medicine\u2019s cost.  Drug companies are prohibited from subsidizing copayments for patients enrolled in the government\u2019s Medicare healthcare program for those aged 65 and older. Companies may donate to non-profits providing copay assistance as long as they are independent.  But the government alleged the drugmakers used such charities as conduits to improperly pay the copay obligations of Medicare patients using their drugs, in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute.  The government alleged that Astellas from 2013 to 2014 while selling the prostate cancer drug Xtandi arranged to have two foundations run funds that would only cover co-pays for patients using androgen receptor inhibitors.  Xtandi at the time was the only major drug used to treat advanced castration resistant prostate cancer from that class of medicines, the government alleged, and Astellas was the only donor to both funds.  The charities were Patient Access Network (PAN) Foundation and Chronic Disease Fund, which is now known as Good Days. PAN said the case involved issues that occurred under its prior leadership. Good Days did not respond to requests for comment.  The government also alleged Amgen from 2011 to 2014 used PAN Foundation as a conduit to pay the copay obligations of Medicare patients using its secondary hyperparathyroidism treatment Sensipar.  The department said Onyx Pharmaceuticals, which Amgen acquired in 2013, also used Chronic Disease Fund as a means to improperly pay the out-of-pocket costs of Medicare patients using its multiple myeloma drug Kyprolis.","103":"A federal appeals court on Wednesday denied a request by Roche Holdings subsidiary Genentech Inc for a temporary order keeping a biosimilar version of its cancer drug Herceptin marketed by Amgen Inc off the U.S. market.

FILE PHOTO: An Amgen sign is seen at the company's office in South San Francisco, California in this October 21, 2013 file photo. REUTERS\/Robert Galbraith  The move deals a blow to Alexion\u2019s efforts to ward off competition for its top-selling drug, which accounted for nearly 82% of the drugmaker\u2019s total revenue in the latest quarter.  Alexion\u2019s shares fell 10.4% to $100.51, while Amgen\u2019s were marginally higher at $208.21.  Amgen is contesting the U.S. patents to Soliris that extend the drug\u2019s market exclusivity to 2027 from 2022.  The Patent Trial and Appeal Board, an administrative court run by the U.S. patent office, said on Friday it was instituting an inter partes review (IPR) on the patents.  The IPR is seeking to invalidate new patents covering the composition of the main ingredient of Soliris, eculizumab, its formulation, and its use to treat blood disorder proxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).  Soliris is approved for four indications and brought in sales of $980.8 million in the quarter ended June 30.  Alexion said it will \u201cvigorously defend\u201d its patents and address the court\u2019s specific concerns in the IPR proceedings.  The drugmaker is trying to retain its stronghold in the PNH market by converting patients to its Soliris-successor Ultomiris, which won U.S. approval last year.  Alexion has also been seeking to expand label for Soliris, which won U.S. approval to treat autoimmune disease neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in June.  Besides PNH and NMOSD, Soliris is approved for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG).  \u201cRegardless of the ultimate outcome here, Soliris has orphan drug designation in the U.S. for gMG through late 2024 and for NMOSD through mid-2026,\u201d the company said.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Orphan drug status comes with incentives, including a period of marketing exclusivity, to developers of rare disease treatments.  A decision on the validity of the new Soliris patents is expected in Q3 2020, as the U.S. patent office may require a full year for its assessment, SVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said.

Bracing for a flood of costly prescription claims for the drug, Aimovig, large insurers such as Anthem Inc have set requirements for patients to document how they suffer from a defined number of headaches each month, and show that they have tried older migraine drugs first.  Others have made it even harder.  Plans including Blue Cross\/Blue Shield in Florida, Pennsylvania and Kansas confirmed with Reuters that they will only cover prescriptions from - or in consultation with - a neurologist or headache specialist, and specifically a member of the United Council for Neurologic Subspecialties.  Only around three percent of U.S. neurologists have such certification, and they are spread unevenly around the country. Florida and Pennsylvania, for example, each have a couple dozen, mostly in or near cities. Kansas has none at all, although there are three in the Missouri side of Kansas City.  The migraine injection from Amgen, with partner Novartis AG , is the newest front in the battle by payors to control costs amid high patient demand for pricey new drugs. New medicines are expected to triple the migraine market to $8 billion a year, mostly paid for by employers and the government.  In the wake of public pressure from President Donald Trump, drugmakers including Pfizer Inc, Merck & Co Inc and Novartis have in recent weeks rolled back planned list price hikes, or pledged to refrain from raising prices.  Amgen, which will report quarterly results on Thursday, is relying on new medicines like Aimovig to offset declining sales of older products beginning to face competition from biosimilar versions.  Aimovig has been shown to significantly reduce migraine frequency in about half of patients. Current migraine treatments are inexpensive generics or over-the-counter pills that might have side effects, or provide only partial relief for many patients.  In May, Amgen and Novartis were the first to win approval for the new type of migraine drug designed to interfere with a chemical involved in processes that kick off the severe headaches. Headache specialists say the new therapy should help validate migraine - a predominantly female disorder - as a debilitating disease with biological causes.  Four other companies - Eli Lilly & Co, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Allergan and Alder Biopharmaceuticals - are all working on potential rivals. The FDA is slated to decide in September on new drug applications from Lilly and Teva.  In the meantime, Amgen is trying to increase Aimovig prescriptions by giving all new patients two free 30-day samples. After that, people with commercial insurance can get up to 12 months free while their coverage is sorted out.  \u201cPatients are coming out of the woodwork now to get this new medication,\u201d said Dr. David Dodick, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona and chairman of the American Migraine Foundation, echoing what other doctors around the country told Reuters about strong demand for the injection.  BARRIERS TO ENTRY  Express Scripts, the nation\u2019s largest manager of prescription benefits, earlier this year urged Amgen to forego the usual drugmaker strategy of setting a high list price, then lowering the cost for health plans through rebates, Reuters reported.  Aimovig\u2019s $6,900-a-year price came in lower than many had expected, and the pharmacy benefit manager now lists Aimovig as a preferred migraine treatment on its largest formulary -requiring that patients first try two older preventive therapies and a triptan, a family of generic drugs used to treat acute migraine.  Express Scripts has Aimovig in the same category as Botox, Allergan Plc\u2019s anti-wrinkle injection approved for preventing migraine in patients suffering from 15 or more headaches a month.  Anthem Inc, the second largest U.S. health insurer, said its affiliated employer-sponsored health plans cover Aimovig with prior authorization and proof that patients have tried other therapy, but do not require prescriptions from board-certified neurologists.  OptumRx, the UnitedHealth Group group unit that manages prescription drug coverage for the largest U.S. health insurer, covers Aimovig if patients have a certain number of headaches each month, have first tried older drugs and get their prescription from a neurologist or pain specialist, according to its prior authorization form. Officials at UnitedHealth did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation.  The No. 3 health insurer Aetna Inc said it is still conducting its clinical policy process for Aimovig and will be determining coverage in the next few weeks.  For patients with commercial insurance already covering Aimovig, Amgen has a program that keeps the monthly co-pay at $5. But that assistance, seen by some as promoting the use of higher-cost drugs, is not allowed for government-sponsored plans including Medicare and Medicaid.  Amgen also has a \u201cSafety Net Foundation\u201d for uninsured or low-income patients whose insurance plans exclude Aimovig.  Dr. Matthew Robbins, chief of neurology at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, said he sees many patients who are struggling financially and wonders, \u201cwhen the two free months are up, are they going to have to come off of the drug? The co-pays are too expensive.\u201d  Prime Therapeutics, which manages prescription benefits for Blue Cross\/Blue Shield plans in several states covering 27 million members, said the final status of its coverage policy will be determined at a September meeting of its pharmacy and therapeutics committee.  Highmark Health, which insures about 5 million people in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Delaware, requires Aimovig to be prescribed by or in consultation with a neurologist or headache specialist, but does not stipulate that they have a specific subspecialty certification.  The challenges have competing drugmakers already talking with insurers about price and coverage terms.  \u201cWe are in discussions with every major PBM and payer right now ... to achieve the right level of access and affordability at the time of launch,\u201d said Wei-Li Shao, vice president of neurosciences at Eli Lilly.  Teva said its drug will be priced competitively \u201cbased on market dynamics.\u201d  Allergan Chief Commercial Officer Bill Meury said he does not expect the company\u2019s oral drug to be priced at a premium to rival injection medicines.  \u201cWe want to make our medications ... affordable so that health insurers place them on formulary,\u201d he said.  On its website, Optum says it will evaluate all of the new migraine drugs, then \u201cleverage them against each other for the best possible financial arrangement.\u201d (Editing by Elyse Tanouye and Edward Tobin)","109":"NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG sued Amgen Inc on Thursday, accusing the U.S. biotech of trying to back out of the companies\u2019 agreements to develop and market Aimovig for the prevention of migraines.

REUTERS\/Robert Galbraith\/Files  Six patients were still responding at 7.5 months of follow-up, according to research presented in San Diego at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH).  The highest trial dose was discontinued due to toxicity. Nearly a third of trial patients developed serious infections and other side effects included nerve damage and liver failure.  Amgen said AMG420, which targets a protein linked to multiple myeloma known as BCMA, has been given fast track status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  \u201cBased on these data, we plan to open an expanded trial,\u201d David Reese, Amgen\u2019s head of research and development, said in an interview. \u201cWe want to begin exploring quickly enrollment in earlier lines of therapy.\u201d  Amgen\u2019s pipeline of bispecific antibodies, which are designed to attach to a cancer cell and an immune cell, bringing them together so the body\u2019s immune system can kill the cancer, are a cornerstone of the biotech company\u2019s oncology research.  Other companies are exploring different ways to attack the same BCMA target, including bluebird bio Inc, Celgene Corp and Johnson & Johnson.  Earlier at the ASH meeting, bluebird and Celgene presented early trial data showing that experimental cell therapy bb21217 induced responses in 10 out of 12 heavily pre-treated myeloma patients.  Bb21217 is a next-generation version of bb2121, the companies\u2019 more advanced, but still experimental therapy in a class called CAR-T that requires harvesting a patient\u2019s own disease-fighting T-cells, modifying them in a laboratory so they target specific proteins on cancer cells and infusing them back into the patient. The manufacturing process for bb21217 is designed to improve the persistence of the altered cells.  J&J, which licensed BCMA-directed CAR-T LCAR-B38M from a unit of China-based GenScript Biotech Corp, on Monday presented updated results from a Chinese study of the cell therapy in 57 previously treated myeloma patients. It showed that 88 percent of patients responded to the treatment, and 74 percent achieved remission.  J&J is currently enrolling patients in an international study aimed at validating those findings.  Amgen has suggested the \u201coff the shelf\u201d nature of its antibody platform could be an advantage from both a clinical and commercial standpoint, but oncologists say more data is needed.  Trial patients are hospitalized for their first cycle of AMG420, after which they receive the drug by continuous 24-hour infusion for four weeks, followed by two weeks off therapy, for up to 10 cycles.  Amgen has another BCMA-targeting antibody that lasts longer in the body, requiring less frequent infusions, but that research is at an earlier stage.  In the current study, 42 patients with multiple myeloma that worsened after at least two prior treatments were given AMG420 at varying doses. A total of 13 patients responded to the treatment, including seven who achieved remission.  Of the 20 patients with serious adverse events, 17 required hospitalization and four had prolonged hospitalization.","113":"Sept 17 (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co on Thursday entered into an agreement with Amgen Inc to increase the supply capacity of the drugmaker\u2019s experimental COVID-19 antibody treatments.

Express Scripts, the largest U.S. manager of prescription benefits, has called for Amgen to reconsider its strategy of setting a high list price for new drugs and then lowering the cost for health plans through hefty rebates.  In a statement on Thursday, Express Scripts said migraine patients have a serious unmet need, but \u201cnot everyone will need this drug\u201d and it will have a program in place to make sure the medication is authorized for only the appropriate patients.  U.S. President Donald Trump last week blasted drugmakers and healthcare \u201cmiddlemen\u201d for making prescription medicines unaffordable for Americans as the administration said it would act to boost competition between pharmaceutical companies and test ways to pay for drugs based on their effectiveness.  The administration said longer-term priorities include restricting use of rebates, creating incentives for drugmakers to lower list prices, and investigating tools to address foreign government practices that it said could be harming innovation and driving up U.S. prices.  Aimovig is the first in a new class of treatments designed to prevent migraine by interfering with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which is involved in the processes that kick off the severe headaches, such as dilation of blood vessels in the brain.  Companies including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Eli Lilly & Co and Alder Biopharmaceuticals Inc are developing similar treatments.  In three separate pivotal trials, involving patients with chronic or episodic migraines, patients given Aimovig experienced an average of one to 2.5 fewer migraine days a month than those treated with a placebo, the FDA said.  The most common side effects reported by patients in the trials were injection site reactions and constipation.  Preventive medications may be an option for around eight million Americans suffering from migraine, Amgen said.  Current migraine treatments are mostly repurposed generic drugs including anti-depressants and hypertension medicines.

Analysts, on average, have forecast annual Aimovig sales of nearly $1 billion by 2022, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Express Scripts has also suggested that Aimovig prescriptions be at least partially refunded if the drug fails to work, since many patients in the clinical trials did not have a significant response to the treatment.

Amgen did not give the pricing of the drug immediately, but said is confident to compete in the biosimilar market.  The label for the treatment carries a boxed warning, FDA\u2019s harshest, flagging risks of serious infections and malignancy, similar to that of Remicade\u2019s.  With the regulatory approval, Avsola joins the existing biosimilars to J&J\u2019s drug, including Pfizer Inc\u2019s 2017 approved Ixifi, Celltrion Inc\u2019s Inflectra and Merck & Co and Samsung Bioepis Co Ltd\u2019s Renflexis.

Avsola was approved for all eligible indications of Remicade, including the treatment of bowel disease, Crohn\u2019s disease and skin disorder plaque psoriasis, the agency said.  Biosimilars are medicines considered highly similar to an original drug and are cheaper alternatives to biologic products.

He said previous studies excluded patients who had tried more than two other treatments.  Reuter said the 17-point gap between the treatment and placebo groups was in line with previous Aimovig studies.  Aimovig, currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is likely to be the first drug in a new class designed to target calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which plays a key role in migraine activation. A decision by the FDA is due by May 17.  Amgen has partnered with Novartis AG to co-commercialize Aimovig in the United States, while Amgen has rights to the drug in Japan and Novartis has rights to commercialize in rest of world. The drug, a monoclonal antibody, was given monthly by injection at a dose of 140 mg for the trial.  Similar drugs are under development at companies including Eli Lilly & Co and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, but Amgen emphasizes that Aimovig is the only one that targets the CGRP receptor pathway, rather than CGRP itself.

REUTERS\/Robert Galbraith  (Reuters) - Drugmaker Amgen Inc said on Thursday that starting next year, its official list price for cholesterol drug Repatha will be the lower price it began offering last year to patients on Medicare and those paying for the drug out-of-pocket.  The company launched the lower price option last October, selling the drug to some patients under the list price of $5,850 per year because the drug\u2019s original $14,000-year-list price was too much for many patients in Medicare or with high-deductible plans.  But Amgen still sold the drug under its original list price, because it had already negotiated discounts in contracts with payers like pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) based on that price. At the time, Amgen said $5,850 was in line with what most patients with private insurance were paying for the drug after discounts and rebates.  They said then that they planned on discontinuing the original list price of Repatha by the end of 2020 or sooner.  The list price for drugs is not necessarily what patients actually pay as \u201cout-of-pocket\u201d costs vary based on the duration of the treatment and individual healthcare plans.  Amgen said that the cost for patients covered under its current contracts with PBMs and health plans will pay $5,850 a year or less for Repatha.  It said that standardizing the lower price option will help because some Medicare patients\u2019 prescription drug plans were not able to buy the drug under the lower list price option.  Sales of drugs like Repatha that dramatically lower bad LDL cholesterol by targeting the PCSK9 protein have been constrained by insurers looking to limit spending on the expensive drugs, which compete with cheap statins that cost hundreds of dollars per year.","146":"The Patent Trial and Appeal Board on Thursday invalidated all claims of a patent that Amgen has accused Sanofi-Aventis and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals of infringing with their breakthrough biologic Dupixent.

Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen won a similar verdict in 2016, as well as a court order blocking Praluent sales, but an appeals court set aside the victory and ordered a new trial.","157":"March 23 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc:  * AMGEN RECEIVES POSITIVE CHMP OPINION RECOGNIZING THAT REPATHA (EVOLOCUMAB) PREVENTS HEART ATTACKS AND STROKES  * AMGEN INC - RECOMMENDED LABEL INCLUDES NEW INDICATION BASED ON REPATHA CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOMES STUDY Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","158":"May 21 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc:  * FDA APPROVES PROLIA\u00ae (DENOSUMAB) FOR GLUCOCORTICOID-INDUCED OSTEOPOROSIS  * FDA APPROVES PROLIA\u00ae (DENOSUMAB) FOR GLUCOCORTICOID-INDUCED OSTEOPOROSIS  * AMGEN INC - SAFETY RESULTS WERE CONSISTENT WITH KNOWN SAFETY PROFILE OF PROLIA  * AMGEN INC - APPROVAL OF PROLIA FOR GLUCOCORTICOID-INDUCED OSTEOPOROSIS IS BASED ON DATA FROM A PHASE 3 STUDY Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","159":"(Corrects spelling of drug in headline and first bullet)  Jan 2 (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd :  * TEVA AND AMGEN RESOLVE ONGOING DISPUTE OVER TEVA\u2019S GENERIC CINACALCET HCL PRODUCT  * TEVA WILL PAY AMGEN AN UNDISCLOSED AMOUNT AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT  * THE AMOUNT AND OTHER TERMS OF SETTLEMENT REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL  * TEVA PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES- LITIGATION BETWEEN PARTIES TO BE ENDED  * TEVA PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES- CO AGREED TO STOP SELLING ITS GENERIC PRODUCT UNTIL LICENSE DATE IN MID 2021, OR EARLIER UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","160":"April 30 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc on Thursday reported better-than-expected first-quarter results on Thursday and said it plans to study psoriasis drug Otezla as a potential treatment for COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus.  Otezla, which Amgen acquired last year from Celgene Corp as part of Celgene\u2019s buyout by Bristol Myers Squibb Co, is a pill that helps reduce overactive inflammation. Other similar medicines are also being tested to see if they can help COVID-19 patients.  Amgen, which maintained its full-year earnings forecast, also said it is working with partner Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp to identify antibodies targeting the novel coronavirus that may be developed into a drug to potentially prevent or treat COVID-19.  Amgen said strong first-quarter sales of Otezla, along with higher volume sales of drugs like cholesterol treatment Repatha, contributed to an 11% increase in revenue for the period.  The company last year launched a lower-priced Repatha option aimed at reducing out-of-pocket costs for Medicare patients.  The biotechnology company reported an adjusted profit of $4.17 per share, up 17% from a year earlier and well above analysts\u2019 average expectations of $3.76, according to Refinitiv IBES.  Amgen said the results were driven by revenue of $6.16 billion and fewer shares outstanding. That topped Wall Street estimates for revenue of just under $6 billion.  Net profit fell 3% to $3.07 per share due to higher operating costs that were partially offset by the lower share count.  For 2020, the Thousand Oaks, California-based company said it still expects adjusted earnings of $14.85 to $15.60 per share on revenue of $25 billion to $25.6 billion.

The department said Astellas Pharma and Amgen Inc were the latest pharmaceutical companies to settle claims stemming from an industry-wide probe of drugmakers\u2019 financial support of patient assistance charities.

FILE PHOTO: An Amgen sign is seen at the company's office in South San Francisco, California in this October 21, 2013 file photo. REUTERS\/Robert Galbraith  The decision was a relief to investors concerned about a competitive threat to Enbrel, which had U.S. sales of $4.8 billion last year. Shares of Amgen closed up about 6% at $196.25 after the ruling.  \u201cThis is a key overhang removed,\u201d Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said in a research note. \u201cWhile an (expedited) appeal is in place and expected, we believe the worst-case fear is now gone.\u201d  U.S. District Judge Claire Cecchi in Newark, New Jersey, rejected arguments by Novartis\u2019 Sandoz unit that the patents covering Enbrel\u2019s active ingredient until 2029 should not have been granted because their concepts were already contained in previous patents.  Enbrel has been on the U.S. market since 1998. It was developed by Immunex, which Amgen acquired in 2002.  Novartis said it would appeal the ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  \u201cSandoz respectfully disagrees with the Court\u2019s ruling, which prevents us from launching an additional treatment option for patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases,\u201d said Carol Lynch, president of Sandoz US and head of North America.  U.S. regulators in recent years have acted to encourage the launch of \u201cbiosimilar\u201d versions of pricey biologic drugs, but drugmakers like Amgen have used litigation to extend patent protections and limit price competition for as long as possible. Biologics are made from living cells and are therefore difficult to copy with precision.  The Food and Drug Administration said last year that biologic drugs account for almost 40 percent of U.S. prescription drug spending, and for 70 percent of the growth in drug spending between 2010 and 2015.  The United States has lagged behind Europe in use of biosimilars.  Pfizer Inc holds rights to Enbrel in Europe, where biosimilar versions are available.  AbbVie has said that rival biosimilar versions of its multi-billion-dollar rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira are available in Europe at discounts ranging from 10 percent to 80 percent.  The FDA in 2016 approved Novartis\u2019 Erelzi as a so-called biosimilar, meaning it is not different from Enbrel in any clinically significant way, but is not identical as a generic drug would be.  Novartis and Amgen are also involved in litigation over a partnership to develop migraine drug Aimovig, which was launched in the United States last year. Amgen is seeking to terminate the partnership, arguing that Novartis has violated the terms due to an agreement by Sandoz to manufacture a rival migraine drug.  U.S.-listed shares of Novartis closed down 0.5% at $90.82.  Amgen is also suing Samsung Bioepis over its Enbrel biosimilar. That litigation remains under way, an Amgen spokeswoman said on Friday. Officials at Samsung Bioepis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","164":"Oct 28 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc on Wednesday said its third-quarter adjusted profit rose 17% due to stronger sales of drugs including the osteoporosis treatment Prolia and recently-acquired psoriasis medication Otezla.  The higher-than-expected results were partially offset by lower drug prices and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The biotechnology company said that more patients had resumed interacting with their doctors in the third quarter than earlier in the health crisis, but prescribing volumes remained \u201cmodestly below\u201d pre-pandemic levels.  The company raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to $15.80 to $16.15 per share, from a previous range of $15.10 to $15.75, and narrowed its revenue estimate. It now expects revenue of $25.1 billion to $25.5 billion versus it prior forecast of $25.0 billion to $25.6 billion.  Amgen also lowered its expected 2020 tax rate to 13% to 14% from 13.5% to 14.5%.  The company reported a third-quarter adjusted profit $4.37 per share, beating the average estimate of $3.81 per share, as compiled by Refinitiv.  Revenue for the quarter rose 12% to $6.4 billion, in line with analyst estimates of $6.38 billion.  Sales of Prolia rose 11% to $701 million, ahead of the average analyst estimate of $688 million.  Psoriasis drug Otezla, acquired from Celgene Corp in November, had sales of $538 million for the quarter, falling short of analyst expectations of $587 million.  Sales of Amgen\u2019s older arthritis drug Enbrel fell 3% year-over-year to $1.3 billion as the drug continued to lose market share in the quarter. That still topped analysts\u2019 expectations of $1.26 billion.  Amgen\u2019s posted a net income of $2.02 billion, or $3.43 per share, compared with a profit of $1.97 billion, or $3.27 a share, a year ago.

(Reporting by Jan Wolfe; editing by Jonathan Oatis)","166":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc said on Monday that they will slash the U.S. list price of their potent but expensive cholesterol fighter Praluent by 60 percent, as the drugmakers follow a similar move by rival Amgen Inc in hopes of increasing use of the drug.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Sanofi is pictured during the Viva Tech start-up and technology summit in Paris, France, May 25, 2018. REUTERS\/Charles Platiau  The new list price for Praluent will be $5,850 a year, matching the price Amgen set when it lowered the list of its competing drug, Repatha, in October.  Sanofi and Regeneron said they expect the lower-priced Praluent to be available for pharmacies to order in early March. They said the new price should improve patient access and result in lower out-of-pocket costs for U.S. consumers.  Praluent and Repatha belong a class of injectable biotech drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors that dramatically lower bad LDL cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart attacks and death.  Sales of both have been severely constrained by onerous roadblocks to patient access put up by insurers looking to limit spending on the expensive drugs.  They were approved in 2015 with initial list prices of more than $14,000 a year.  In March of last year, Regeneron and Sanofi said that they would be willing to charge less for their drug if insurers agreed to reduce barriers for high-risk heart patients.  A few months later they struck a deal with Express Scripts, now part of Cigna Corp, to make the drug available to that company\u2019s customers at a price in the range of $4,500 to $6,600 a year.  The United States, which leaves drug pricing to market competition, has higher prices than in other developed countries, where governments directly or indirectly control costs. That makes it by far the world\u2019s most lucrative market for manufacturers.  Congress has been targeting the pharmaceutical industry over the rising cost of prescription drugs for U.S. consumers, particularly since Democrats took over the House of Representatives in January.  Executives from at least six drugmakers plan to testify at a Senate hearing on rising prescription drug prices later this month.  Drug pricing is also a top priority of the administration of President Donald Trump, who had made it a central issue of the 2016 presidential campaign.","167":"April 30 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc  * AMGEN INC - QTRLY TOTAL REVENUE INCREASED 11% TO $6.2 BILLION; QTRLY GAAP EPS $3.07; QTRLY NON-GAAP EPS $4.17  * AMGEN INC - 2020 EPS GUIDANCE REVISED TO $10.65 - $11.45 ON A GAAP BASIS  * AMGEN INC - REAFFIRMED 2020 EPS GUIDANCE OF $14.85 - $15.60 ON A NON-GAAP BASIS  * AMGEN INC - 2020 TOTAL REVENUE GUIDANCE REAFFIRMED AT $25 BILLION - $25.6 BILLION  * AMGEN INC - QTRLY TOTAL PRODUCT SALES INCREASED 12%  * AMGEN INC - QTRLY OTEZLA SALES $479 MILLION  * AMGEN INC - SEES 2020 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO BE ABOUT $600 MILLION  * AMGEN - ENROLLMENT IS PAUSED IN CLINICAL TRIALS WHERE THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE ABILITY OF SITES TO ENSURE SUBJECT SAFETY\/DATA INTEGRITY  * AMGEN SAYS OTEZLA WILL BE INVESTIGATED AS A POTENTIAL IMMUNOMODULATORY TREATMENT IN ADULT PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 IN UPCOMING TRIALS Source text for Eikon:"}}
