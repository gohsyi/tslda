The test was less sensitive in detecting asymptomatic infection, but the CDC study found that the faster turnaround time can help limit transmission by more rapidly identifying infectious persons for isolation. (bit.ly\/38WwExa)  The study comes when public health departments are scrambling to implement strategies to reduce or prevent the rapid spread of the virus, with the United States recording more than 200,000 new cases and 3,220 deaths on average over the last seven days.  Several rapid antigen tests have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use, but data lacks on test performance in asymptomatic people, according to a team of scientists from CDC\u2019s COVID-19 Response Team and the Arizona Department of Health Services.  Using the real-time reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction, or RT-PCR, test as the standard, the CDC studied over 3,400 specimens collected from people aged over 10 years at two community testing sites in Pima County, Arizona, from Nov. 3 to Nov. 17.  Compared with RT-PCR, Abbott\u2019s BinaxNOW antigen test had a sensitivity of 64.2% for specimens from symptomatic people and only 35.8% for specimens from asymptomatic people.  It had near 100% specificity in specimens from both groups, suggesting very few false positives and no false negatives.  \u201cBinaxNOW is great at finding infectious people \u2013 and this Pima County study demonstrates that BinaxNOW is 92.6% effective at identifying positive cases when people are infectious - in line with our performance data,\u201d Abbott said in an emailed statement.  The researchers said swabs from the back of the nose were taken for the RT-PCR tests, which might have contributed to increased detection for the real-time RT-PCR assay. Swabs from the front of the nose were used for BinaxNOW.","2":"(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories and AbbVie Inc will pay a total of $25 million to resolve allegations that Abbott paid kickbacks to doctors in exchange for prescribing the cholesterol drug TriCor and promoted the medication for unapproved purposes.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The U.S. Justice Department on Friday announced the settlement, which resolves claims first raised in a whistleblower lawsuit filed in federal court in Philadelphia in 2009 by a former Abbott sales representative. AbbVie was spun out of Abbott in 2013.  Neither company, both of which are based in Chicago, admitted to wrongdoing as part of the settlement.  AbbVie in a statement said the settlement concerned sales and marketing practices that occurred over a decade ago.  \u201cThe company determined it was in its best interest to resolve these allegations, rather than engage in protracted litigation, and focus on current business priorities,\u201d AbbVie said.  Abbott declined to comment.  The lawsuit alleged that from 2006 to 2008, Abbott, through its sales representatives, provided physicians kickbacks in the form of gift baskets, gift cards and other items in order to encourage them to write prescriptions for TriCor.  The lawsuit claimed that Abbott also retained healthcare providers for consulting services and speaking engagements in order to induce or reward doctors for writing prescriptions for the drug.  Abbott also improperly marketed and promoted TriCor for purposes other than those approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, including as a treatment to prevent or reduce cardiac health risks in diabetic patients, the lawsuit said.  The lawsuit was filed by Amy Bergman, a former Abbott sales representative, under the False Claims Act, which allows whistleblowers to sue companies on the government\u2019s behalf to recover taxpayer money paid out based on fraudulent claims.  The government may intervene in such cases, but chose not to in this case, leaving Bergman to litigate it on her own prior to the settlement\u2019s being announced. As a reward, Bergman will receive $6.5 million as her share of the settlement.  The case is U.S. ex rel. Amy Bergman, et al. v.

Shares of the company, whose products range from nutritional products to glucose monitoring devices, fell 2.1 percent to $69.51 in premarket trading.  The company\u2019s adjusted profit was in line with analysts\u2019 expectations as a drop in sales at its established pharmaceuticals business was offset by growth in its medical device segment, its largest unit.  New device launches and demand for its glucose monitoring products helped the unit raking in $2.82 billion in revenue, leading to 12.1 percent rise in overall sales in the quarter.  However, the pharmaceuticals business, which sells generic drugs in emerging markets such as India and China, fell nearly 1 percent to $1.16 billion, hurt by a strong dollar.  The company said net earnings fell to $563 million, or 32 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $603 million, or 34 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, Abbott earned 75 cents per share, in line with the average analyst estimate, according to I\/B\/E\/S data from Refinitiv.  Net sales rose to $7.66 billion, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of $7.65 billion.

Any room for uncertainty, people react first and ask questions later. Post call... I think people are comfortable with the growth algorithm here,\u201d said Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar.  A 63% jump in sales of FreeStyle Libre continuous glucose monitor powered the diabetes unit\u2019s better-than-expected revenue of $665 million. Two analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected $645 million.  The device helps diabetics track blood sugar levels without having to prick their fingers, and the company is awaiting the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval for the next-generation version of the device, the Freestyle Libre 2.0.  However, a lack of updates on the approval also left investors skittish.  \u201cAdmittedly, it\u2019s taking longer than we had expected. We obviously misjudged that,\u201d Chief Operating Officer Robert Ford said on a conference call with analysts, but did not provide a timeline for the approval.  The cardiovascular business, the company\u2019s biggest that houses the MitraClip, posted sales of $2.40 billion, below estimates of $2.44 billion, according to two analysts polled by Refinitiv.  Sales of MitraClip, seen as another growth driver, jumped 30% to $176 million.

White, 64, will remain the executive chairman and will be succeeded by Chief Operating Officer Robert Ford, who he appointed last year as part of succession planning.  Abbott\u2019s shares have gained more than four-fold during White\u2019s more than two decades at the helm. They were marginally lower in early trading e following the company\u2019s statement on Wednesday.  \u201cWhile Miles White was at times considered a larger-than-life figure at Abbott, we think Bob Ford is the right person to fill Miles\u2019 shoes,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar said in a client note.  White, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, was instrumental in Abbott's acquisitions of rivals St. Jude Medical and Alere, as well as the spinoffs of Abbott's pharmaceutical arm into AbbVie Inc ABBV.N in 2013 and of Hospira earlier in 2004. Hospira was bought by Pfizer Inc PFE.N in 2015.  He also spearheaded the purchase of BASF\u2019s Knoll pharmaceutical business in 2001 that also brought with it the world\u2019s best-selling drug, Humira. Humira is now owned by AbbVie.  White also serves on the boards of McDonald's Corp MCD.N and Caterpillar Inc CAT.N.  Ford has been with the company for 23 years and had headed Abbott\u2019s medical devices unit. He is a key person behind the company\u2019s FreeStyle Libre glucose monitoring device, its fastest growing diabetes product, according to analyst Kumar.  Abbott is betting on the device, which helps diabetics track blood sugar levels without having to prick their fingers, to cushion slowing growth in some of its older products.  White\u2019s total compensation, including stock awards, was $24.3 million last year.","6":"June 22 (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories:  * ABBOTT LABORATORIES FILES FOR POTENTIAL 2-PART, NOTES OFFERING; SIZE NOT DISCLOSED - SEC FILING Source text: (bit.ly\/3hT6Zrw) Further company coverage:","7":"April 23 (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories:  * ABBOTT LABORATORIES - CO, SANQUIN SIGN MULTIPLE-YEAR CONTRACT FOR SUPPLY OF PRIMARY SEROLOGICAL EQUIPMENT AND CONSUMABLES Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Reuters.Briefs@thomsonreuters.com)","8":"Dec 17 (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories:  * U.S. HHS\u2019 GIROIR SAYS WORKING WITH ABBOTT TO INCREASE PRODUCTION OF SWABS USED IN COVID-19 TESTS  * U.S. HHS\u2019 GIROIR SAYS AT-HOME COVID-19 TESTS WILL BE IMPROVEMENT OVER POINT-OF-CARE TESTS FOR REPORTING RESULTS TO PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS  * U.S. HHS\u2019 GIROIR SAYS HERD IMMUNITY COULD BE ACHIEVED WHEN 75%-80% OF POPULATION IS IMMUNIZED: BRIEFING  * U.S. HHS\u2019 GIROIR SAYS AS OF THIS WEEK SHIPPED 102 MILLION BINAX TESTS FROM ABBOT INCLUDING 66 MILLION TO STATES Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Reporting by Carl O\u2019Donnell)","9":"May 14 (Reuters) - U.S. Food and Drug Administration:  * CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) UPDATE: FDA INFORMS PUBLIC ABOUT POSSIBLE ACCURACY CONCERNS WITH ABBOTT ID NOW POINT-OF-CARE TEST  * FDA SAYS ABBOTT ID NOW POINT-OF-CARE TEST TO DIAGNOSE COVID-19 MAY RETURN FALSE NEGATIVE RESULTS  * U.S. FDA- ALERTING PUBLIC TO EARLY DATA THAT SUGGEST POTENTIAL INACCURATE RESULTS FROM USING ABBOTT ID NOW POINT-OF-CARE TEST TO DIAGNOSE COVID-19  * U.S. FDA - ABBOTT\u2019S TEST CAN STILL BE USED AND CAN CORRECTLY IDENTIFY MANY POSITIVE CASES IN MINUTES  * FDA - RECEIVED 15 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTS ABOUT ABBOTT ID NOW DEVICE THAT SUGGEST SOME USERS ARE RECEIVING INACCURATE NEGATIVE RESULTS  * U.S. FDA- ABBOTT HAS AGREED TO CONDUCT POST-MARKET STUDIES FOR ID NOW DEVICE THAT EACH WILL INCLUDE AT LEAST 150 COVID-19 POSITIVE PATIENTS  * FDA- AGENCY IS REVIEWING ADVERSE EVENT REPORTS ABOUT ABBOTT ID NOW DEVICE Source text for Eikon:","10":"MILAN\/LONDON\/HONG KONG\/NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Breakingviews has launched a daily column covering pandemic-related insights that you might have missed.

Meantime, Tegna is fending off a proxy fight from Standard General, which owns nearly a 10% interest in the $2.3 billion broadcaster. Standard General blamed Tegna on Monday of stalling the auction. In theory a deal could still happen. Tegna benefits in part from political advertising, which, in a presidential election year, is the closest thing to a near certainty.

Carlos Torres Vila can expect to receive fewer Christmas cards this year from European banking peers. The executive chairman of BBVA, Spain\u2019s second largest lender, has renounced the 2020 bonuses of 300 senior staff, including himself, in order to \u201clead from the front\u201d during the coronavirus crisis. The move heaps pressure on other lenders to follow suit.  BBVA expects to save some 50 million euros, equivalent to 0.8% of annual personnel costs. If the same proportion was applied at BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Barclays and Santander, then Europe\u2019s six biggest banks could collectively conserve over half a billion euros, according to their latest results. That would soothe shareholders fretting about dividend cuts and help fend off the kind of anti-bank sentiment seen after the 2008 crisis. Yet, having given up their bonuses, it may be harder for bankers to make the case for such fat payouts when the crisis ends. (By Christopher Thompson)  WALL STREET LOSES AN EXECUTIVE. Jefferies Group\u2019s chief financial officer has died of Covid-19 complications. The Wall Street firm, which typically reports its earnings a month before rivals, is often where investors look to see where the industry is going. Peg Broadbent\u2019s death adds another reminder of how rapidly the world has changed.  Broadbent had worked at Jefferies since 2007, when he joined as the group\u2019s first global risk chief just as the financial crisis hit. The investment bank \u2013 now a subsidiary of listed Jefferies Financial \u2013 came through the crisis mostly unscathed, and didn\u2019t take government rescue funds.  Last week Jefferies reported record quarterly revenue, as a group and at the investment bank Broadbent helped to oversee. Chief Executive Rich Handler noted that in light of events since its financial quarter ended in February, the result already feels like \u201cancient history.\u201d He won\u2019t be the last to say so. (By John Foley)  THE OPPOSITE OF BUYER\u2019S REMORSE. The market value of Abbott Laboratories, which obtained approval for a rapid coronavirus test, rocketed over $10 billion at the start of U.S. trading on Monday morning. The five-minute test is the fruit of a merger Abbott didn\u2019t want to do. The company says tests will be available this week and production will rise to 50,000 per day. It could sell more: Quick tests could be crucial to the safe reopening of factories and public spaces, as well as for use in medical facilities.  The irony is that Abbott\u2019s new bounty comes from technology purchased in its acquisition of Alere. Abbott agreed to buy the company for $5.8 billion in 2016, then got cold feet following revelations of improper accounting at Alere as well as allegations of other bad practices. Alere sued because it didn\u2019t want the deal terminated, and Abbott begrudgingly completed the deal in 2017 at a 9% lower price. Its unexpected virus-testing boost is worth twice the purchase price. (By Robert Cyran)  SICKLY M&A. The UK\u2019s most prominent recent fund management deal could fall foul of the coronavirus. A pandemic probably wasn\u2019t high on Chief Executive Andrew Formica\u2019s radar when he announced in February that his Jupiter Fund Management would gobble up smaller rival Merian Global Investors for 370 million pounds. Back then investors seemed happy to forgive Formica for the deal\u2019s vague benefits: Jupiter didn\u2019t say what synergies it expected to get from combining with Merian, other than to promise that the acquired group had \u201cthe potential to contribute to\u201d an operating margin of up to 60%.  That may be a stretch now. Merian was losing assets before the virus struck. Now it faces declines in the value of the funds it manages, and possibly even more outflows. The over 50% collapse in Jupiter\u2019s share price since the beginning of the year, worse than peers M&G and Standard Life Aberdeen, suggests investors don\u2019t see much benefit from the deal. They will have the chance to vote on whether to proceed in April. To convince them, Formica will need to come up with some more compelling numbers. (By Aimee Donnellan)  SOCCER SACRIFICE. The coronavirus pandemic has Europe\u2019s star soccer players counting their losses. Players at top teams are foregoing part of their paycheques to ease the financial burden from the forced suspension of matches across most of the continent. Juventus star Cristiano Ronaldo will forfeit four months\u2019 salary, a third of his 31 million euro annual package, according to Sky Italia. His teammates and coach will do the same, saving the club a total of about 90 million euros \u2013 meaningful given its 327 million euro net debt.  Not every footballer has volunteered happily. Barcelona, which had sought a 70% salary reduction for players including star forward Lionel Messi, used Spain\u2019s emergency law to unilaterally impose a cut. Swiss club Sion fired nine of its players for refusing to accept part-time contracts. With millions of people facing the prospect of losing their jobs, some soccer self-restraint seems in order.

In late March, Trump hailed the launch of Abbott Laboratories\u2019 ID NOW test at a Rose Garden event and embraced its widespread use at the White House to keep the deadly virus at bay. The president often skipped his own administration\u2019s public health recommendations on mask wearing and social distancing, explaining that \u201ceveryone\u2019s tested\u201d around him using the Abbott device.  His strategy was no match for the virus.  The president announced Friday that both he and his wife, Melania, tested positive - news that raised questions about the health of other top U.S. officials and threw the final weeks of the presidential campaign into disarray. On Friday, Trump began an experimental treatment and checked in to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center as a precautionary measure, a White House official said.  \u201cThe reliance on a rapid test, with its limitations, unfortunately gave the White House and its staff a false sense of security that they were in control of the virus,\u201d said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.  \u201cYou cannot rely on that test to create a barrier between you and the virus,\u201d he said, adding that people \u201chave to wear masks, do social distancing and not go to all these rallies.\u201d  While rapid tests can help contain the spread of a highly contagious virus, they were not designed to be used in isolation. A negative result merely captures a snapshot in time and doesn\u2019t guard against infection soon after. And a person may be infectious for days before the amount of virus in their body registers positive on a test.  Krutika Kuppalli, an assistant professor and expert on infectious diseases at the Medical University of South Carolina, said not enough is known about how these rapid tests perform in people who are asymptomatic.  \u201cTrump was playing with fire and it was really a matter of time before something like this was going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if Trump had been around someone who was sick, wearing a mask could have prevented him from getting the virus.\u201d  Slideshow ( 5 images )  The White House said in a statement Thursday that Trump \u201ctakes the health and safety of himself and everyone who works in support of him and the American people very seriously\u201d and that the administration followed guidelines for limiting COVID-19 exposure to the greatest extent possible.  As of midday Saturday, a growing number of Trump administration officials and allies had tested positive for the virus, including former senior counselor Kellyanne Conway; three Republican senators including Mike Lee of Utah; Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel; and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Trump\u2019s close aide Hope Hicks\u2019 positive test was disclosed on Thursday.  DOUBTERS AND DEFENDERS  An Abbott spokeswoman said the company\u2019s ID NOW test for the coronavirus - used by more than 11 million Americans since regulators approved it for emergency use in March - yields reliable results. The company referred questions about its use in the White House to the Trump administration.  The gold standard in diagnostic testing is known as polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, testing and is performed in a laboratory. But these tests can take hours or days to process. Abbott\u2019s ID NOW device offers two major advantages: a quick turnaround on site and portability.  The Abbott test, which involves putting a nasal swab in a liquid solution and heating it to amplify genetic material from the virus, produces results in 13 minutes or less.  \u201cIn a pandemic, the world needs all types of testing for different settings and stages of the virus, including lab-based testing and rapid point-of-care testing,\u201d Abbott said in a statement.  The White House hasn\u2019t released details on what tests were conducted in recent days on Trump and Hicks. And there is no evidence that the Abbott tests routinely performed on White House staff and visitors produced inaccurate results, nor that Trump or Hicks were infected in the White House rather than in other settings.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  However, despite Trump\u2019s enthusiastic endorsement of the Abbott ID NOW test, some researchers have raised doubts about its accuracy.  In May, a New York University study said the Abbott test could be missing a third to nearly half of positive cases. That same month, researchers at Columbia University Irving Medical Center found that the ID NOW test identified only 73.9% of infectious samples.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration acknowledged there were concerns about \u201cpotential inaccurate results\u201d from ID NOW in May. The agency said it had received 302 \u201cadverse event\u201d reports as of Sept. 30, including numerous reports of false negatives - results showing patients were not infected when they actually were.  In its authorization of ID NOW for emergency use, updated last month, the FDA warned that more testing may be warranted to confirm initial results.  In a statement on Friday, Abbott said the NYU study was flawed and \u201crife with limitations.\u201d The company said its device produces results similar to lab-based methods and that even the most sensitive tests can post false negatives depending on the infection cycle in a person\u2019s body and how much virus they are shedding.  A company spokeswoman said \u201cno test detects the virus immediately after the person becomes infected.\u201d  In a statement Friday, White House doctor Sean Conley said the president\u2019s diagnosis was confirmed with traditional PCR testing.  \u2018DEEMED SAFE\u2019  Emboldened by regular testing of himself and those in close proximity, Trump continued to hold large campaign rallies and events with donors where masks were optional. He flew to his New Jersey golf club Thursday for a fundraiser and speech.  \u201cIt was deemed safe for the president to go. He socially distanced, it was an outdoor event and it was deemed safe by White House operations for him to attend that event,\u201d White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Friday.  Trump and his staff regularly do not wear masks. Last month, Trump publicly disagreed with Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who testified to Congress about the importance of the face coverings.  And at Tuesday\u2019s presidential debate, Trump disparaged his opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, for his frequent mask use. \u201cI don\u2019t wear masks like him - every time you see him, he\u2019s got a mask,\u201d the president said.  Now, the fallout from the White House\u2019s focus on testing as a precaution could extend far beyond the president and his wife, experts say.  \u201cI expect we will see more positive cases\u201d connected to the White House, Kuppalli said. \u201cI pray that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d  (This story fixes capitalization of \u201ca\u201d in Kellyanne Conway)","13":"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday authorized the emergency use of Abbott Laboratories\u2019 coronavirus test for detecting antibodies using another of its diagnostic platforms, which will allow the company to ship nearly 30 million tests this month.  Earlier, the company had permission to run the antibody test on its Architect platform. The authorization now allows Abbott to use the test on its Alinity platform.  Abbott also said it could have capacity for shipping 60 million antibody tests across the world in June, which included tests on its Architect system, for which it gained authorization last month.

The test identifies disease-fighting antibodies in people who have been infected but may have had mild symptoms or none at all, making it different from the current diagnostic tests that require nasal swabs to confirm active infection.  Antibody tests, however, are not recommended as the sole basis of diagnosis of COVID-19 as these antibodies may not be detected in the early days of the infection.  Such tests are considered crucial in efforts to get Americans back to work safely as the presence of antibodies to the virus indicates possible immunity to future infection.  Abbott has previously won U.S. authorization for two other coronavirus testing kits: an automated test that can be used in labs and a test that can deliver results within minutes and be used in physicians\u2019 offices, clinics and hospitals.","14":"A federal judge on Friday allowed Abbott Laboratories to question a wholesaler and its former lawyer about why they withheld documents sought by the healthcare giant in a trademark infringement case, saying there is probable cause to believe they engaged in discovery fraud.

And Abbott raised its annual forecast thanks to rising confidence that there will be of more of the same for the rest of 2020.  With widespread vaccination still distant, the Covid-19 tailwind will blow for several more quarters. The number of cases is rising again in much of the northern hemisphere. That\u2019s mostly, but not entirely, positive for Abbott. Surgeries will probably once again be put on hold. But most operations will eventually be done.

Britain\u2019s banks may have come up with a neat workaround to avoid a post-Covid public relations disaster.

That would avoid the awkward scenario of individual banks chasing struggling hairdressers and caf\u00e9s for cash they may not have \u2013 a scenario that seemed possible after finance minister Rishi Sunak rebuffed the idea of a government-run collections agency.  Sunak may yet regret his decision, however. The banks have little interest in setting up a body that ruthlessly pursues borrowers, since they can claim back any loan losses from the government. It\u2019s possible that the Treasury ends up with a huge bill. The finance minister can\u2019t dodge his responsibility by pretending it\u2019s the banks\u2019 problem \u2013 especially as the scheme was his in the first place. (By Liam Proud)  BACK OF THE NET. Manchester United\u2019s patchy on-pitch form has extended to its finances. The UK-based soccer club reported a 23 million pound net loss in its financial year on Wednesday as lower revenue from broadcasting and gate receipts hit the top-line. Equally worrying was a precipitous rise in leverage as the pandemic led to deferred sponsorship payments and lost season ticket sales: net debt stood at 474 million pounds, or nearly 4 times trailing EBITDA.  There\u2019s reason to hope for an 89th minute turnaround. The Red Devils managed to grow sales from sponsorships and retail \u2013 over half of total revenue \u2013 by 1.4% year-on-year. The team which includes French midfielder Paul Pogba qualified for the pan-European Champions League, meaning greater TV money. Deloitte reckons the latter will grow by 68% this season for England\u2019s Premier League collectively, which would more than offset Manchester United\u2019s matchday sales last year. And if a newfangled FIFA-backed European club championship ever happens, Manchester United will definitely be in it. (By Christopher Thompson)  OLD NORMAL. Swedish private equity giant EQT is spending again. The 16 billion euro group run by Christian Sinding invested 6 billion euros in the third quarter of 2020, compared with 3.4 billion euros in the same period a year earlier. That compares with a one-fifth slump for the European private equity market as a whole, according to PitchBook.  One possibility is that Sinding\u2019s EQT is a leading indicator. Buyout groups have raised a lot of money in recent years, but won\u2019t earn big fees unless they spend. The alternative is that it is imprudently splashing cash before it\u2019s clear what the post-virus world will look like.

Despite the pandemic, Chief Executive Borje Ekholm was upbeat about the outlook for 5G contracts in mainland China, a crucial source of earnings growth, given that the country accounts for roughly the entire projected global expansion in 5G network equipment this year.  Such optimism could prove ephemeral. Barely 24 hours earlier, Sweden joined other European countries in banning China\u2019s Huawei Technologies and ZTE, from developing its domestic 5G network due to security concerns. Given that Huawei is Ericsson\u2019s biggest rival, the Swedish company may face a stiff reaction from Chinese regulators, who have already called for stricter supervision of foreign telecoms operators.

Other top priorities for the newly purchased tests include day care centers, first responders, and \u201ccritical infrastructure,\u201d said Admiral Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  The tests will be distributed in collaboration with Abbott beginning in mid-September, Giroir said. Abbott said last week it will ramp up production to around 50 million tests per month by mid-October.  The U.S. government agreed to purchase 150 million rapid antigen tests for COVID-19 from Abbott in a roughly $750 million deal.  The portable tests can deliver results within 15 minutes and will sell for $5. They require no additional equipment, and can use a less invasive nasal swab than traditional lab tests.  Antigen tests are cheaper and faster than molecular diagnostic tests, but somewhat more likely to fail to identify positive cases of the virus than lab-based diagnostic tests.  President Donald Trump has repeatedly pushed for schools to reopen, but most of the largest U.S. school districts have said they would start the school year with online classes.  Giroir also said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) still supports testing asymptomatic individuals for COVID-19 who are prioritized by local health officials or in high risk populations. Last week, the CDC sparked outcry among many public health officials when it said testing some asymptomatic people may not be necessary.  The United States has conducted 85 million COVID-19 tests so far with a positivity rate of just over 5%, Giroir said. The mean turnaround time is 2.27 days.","70":"May 2 (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories:  * ABBOTT\u2019S XIENCE SIERRA\u2122 HEART STENT RECEIVES NATIONAL REIMBURSEMENT IN JAPAN TO TREAT PEOPLE WITH CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","71":"Alere Inc, now a unit of Abbott Laboratories Inc, has agreed to pay $20 million to resolve claims it made false and misleading statements to investors in the lead up to the announcement of a deal to sell the diagnostic testing company to Abbott.

In late March, Trump hailed the launch of Abbott Laboratories\u2019 ID NOW test at a Rose Garden event and embraced its widespread use at the White House to keep the deadly virus at bay. The president often skipped his own administration\u2019s public health recommendations on mask wearing and social distancing, explaining that \u201ceveryone\u2019s tested\u201d around him using the Abbott device.  His strategy was no match for the virus.  The president announced Friday that both he and his wife, Melania, tested positive - news that raised questions about the health of other top U.S. officials and threw the final weeks of the presidential campaign into disarray. On Friday, Trump began an experimental treatment and checked in to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center as a precautionary measure, a White House official said.  \u201cThe reliance on a rapid test, with its limitations, unfortunately gave the White House and its staff a false sense of security that they were in control of the virus,\u201d said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.  \u201cYou cannot rely on that test to create a barrier between you and the virus,\u201d he said, adding that people \u201chave to wear masks, do social distancing and not go to all these rallies.\u201d  While rapid tests can help contain the spread of a highly contagious virus, they were not designed to be used in isolation. A negative result merely captures a snapshot in time and doesn\u2019t guard against infection soon after. And a person may be infectious for days before the amount of virus in their body registers positive on a test.  Krutika Kuppalli, an assistant professor and expert on infectious diseases at the Medical University of South Carolina, said not enough is known about how these rapid tests perform in people who are asymptomatic.  \u201cTrump was playing with fire and it was really a matter of time before something like this was going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if Trump had been around someone who was sick, wearing a mask could have prevented him from getting the virus.\u201d  The White House said in a statement Thursday that Trump \u201ctakes the health and safety of himself and everyone who works in support of him and the American people very seriously\u201d and that the administration followed guidelines for limiting COVID-19 exposure to the greatest extent possible.  DOUBTERS AND DEFENDERS  An Abbott spokeswoman said the company\u2019s ID NOW test for the coronavirus - used by more than 11 million Americans since regulators approved it for emergency use in March - yields reliable results. The company referred questions about its use in the White House to the Trump administration.  The gold standard in diagnostic testing is known as polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, testing and is performed in a laboratory. But these tests can take hours or days to process. Abbott\u2019s ID NOW device offers two major advantages: a quick turnaround on site and portability.  The Abbott test, which involves putting a nasal swab in a liquid solution and heating it to amplify genetic material from the virus, produces results in 13 minutes or less.  \u201cIn a pandemic, the world needs all types of testing for different settings and stages of the virus, including lab-based testing and rapid point-of-care testing,\u201d Abbott said in a statement.  The White House hasn\u2019t released details on what tests were conducted in recent days on Trump and Hope Hicks, a top White House adviser who also tested positive this week. And there is no evidence that the Abbott tests routinely performed on White House staff and visitors produced inaccurate results, nor that Trump or Hicks were infected in the White House rather than in other settings.  However, despite Trump\u2019s enthusiastic endorsement of the Abbott ID NOW test, some researchers have raised doubts about its accuracy.  In May, a New York University study said the Abbott test could be missing a third to nearly half of positive cases. That same month, researchers at Columbia University Irving Medical Center found that the ID NOW test identified only 73.9% of infectious samples.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration acknowledged there were concerns about \u201cpotential inaccurate results\u201d from ID NOW in May. The agency said it had received 302 \u201cadverse event\u201d reports as of Sept. 30, including numerous reports of false negatives - results showing patients were not infected when they actually were.  In its authorization of ID NOW for emergency use, updated last month, the FDA warned that more testing may be warranted to confirm initial results.  In a statement on Friday, Abbott said the NYU study was flawed and \u201crife with limitations.\u201d The company said its device produces results similar to lab-based methods and that even the most sensitive tests can post false negatives depending on the infection cycle in a person\u2019s body and how much virus they are shedding.  A company spokeswoman said \u201cno test detects the virus immediately after the person becomes infected.\u201d  In a statement Friday, White House doctor Sean Conley said the president\u2019s diagnosis was confirmed with traditional PCR testing.  \u2018DEEMED SAFE\u2019  Emboldened by regular testing of himself and those in close proximity, Trump continued to hold large campaign rallies and events with donors where masks were optional. He flew to his New Jersey golf club Thursday for a fundraiser and speech.  \u201cIt was deemed safe for the president to go. He socially distanced, it was an outdoor event and it was deemed safe by White House operations for him to attend that event,\u201d White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Friday.  Trump and his staff regularly do not wear masks. Last month, Trump publicly disagreed with Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who testified to Congress about the importance of the face coverings.  And at Tuesday\u2019s presidential debate, Trump disparaged his opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, for his frequent mask use. \u201cI don\u2019t wear masks like him - every time you see him, he\u2019s got a mask,\u201d the president said.  Now, the fallout from the White House\u2019s focus on testing as a precaution could extend far beyond the president and his wife, experts say.  \u201cI expect we will see more positive cases\u201d connected to the White House, Kuppalli said. \u201cI pray that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d (Carl O\u2019Donnell reported from New York; Chad Terhune from Los Angeles.

(bit.ly\/38WwExa)  The study comes when public health departments are scrambling to implement strategies to reduce or prevent the rapid spread of the virus, with the United States recording more than 200,000 new cases and 3,220 deaths on average over the last seven days.  Several rapid antigen tests have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use, but data lacks on test performance in asymptomatic people, according to a team of scientists from CDC\u2019s COVID-19 Response Team and the Arizona Department of Health Services.  Using the real-time reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction, or RT-PCR, test as the standard, the CDC studied over 3,400 specimens collected from people aged over 10 years at two community testing sites in Pima County, Arizona, from Nov. 3 to Nov. 17.  Compared with RT-PCR, Abbott\u2019s BinaxNOW antigen test had a sensitivity of 64.2% for specimens from symptomatic people and only 35.8% for specimens from asymptomatic people.  It had near 100% specificity in specimens from both groups, suggesting very few false positives and no false negatives.  \u201cThe appropriate use of high quality rapid antigen tests like the BinaxNOW can serve to slow the spread of this virus in weeks in any given community and in two months across the U.S.,\u201d said Michael Mina, assistant professor at Harvard University.  The researchers said swabs from the back of the nose were taken for the RT-PCR tests, which might have contributed to increased detection for the real-time RT-PCR assay. Swabs from the front of the nose were used for BinaxNOW.  \u201cBinaxNOW is great at finding infectious people \u2013 and this Pima County study demonstrates that BinaxNOW is 92.6% effective at identifying positive cases when people are infectious - in line with our performance data,\u201d Abbott said in an emailed statement.","97":"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday granted Abbott Laboratories ABT.N approval to sell a test for the new coronavirus, as more companies begin producing much needed diagnostics for the pathogen that has set off a global pandemic.  The tests will help meet a major U.S. shortfall of diagnostic capabilities that has severely limited the nation\u2019s ability to track the spread of the outbreak.  The rise in U.S. cases of COVID-19, a highly contagious and sometimes fatal respiratory illness, has concerned health officials and spurred calls from lawmakers for action to expand testing capacity to slow its spread. Governors around the country have been begging for more test kits.  Abbott said it plans to immediately distribute around 150,000 tests to customers in the United States and will continue to ramp up production to hit a goal of providing up to 1 million tests per week.  \u201cThis is an example of what people can achieve when they come together in a moment of great need,\u201d John Hackett, divisional vice president of applied research and technology at Abbott, said in a telephone interview.  The tests will be conducted on Abbott\u2019s m2000 platform, which is currently installed in 175 labs across the country.  \u201cThe majority of the systems are in hospital labs or academic center labs,\u201d Hackett said. \u201cThese are the places where you need them.\u201d  The FDA has been rushing to approve tests for the coronavirus on an emergency basis and has approved those made by Roche Holding AG ROG.S and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc TMO.N.  Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the White House\u2019s coronavirus task force, said on March 4 that roughly 1.5 million tests would be available by the end of that week, while President Donald Trump said the same week that \u201canyone who wants a test, gets a test.\u201d  Those assurances proved not to be the case and the United States lags far behind most other industrialized nations in coronavirus testing that public health officials deem critically important.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that just over 30,000 coronavirus tests have been conducted by federal, state and local laboratories so far.  With the expansion of testing comes a surge in confirmed cases of COVID-19. More than 200,000 cases have been reported worldwide and over 7,000 in the United States with 118 deaths, according to a tally kept by John\u2019s Hopkins University.","98":"The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday said it has joined a whistleblower lawsuit alleging Abbott Laboratories\u2019 Alere Inc unit defrauded Medicare into paying for unnecessary testing supplies for diabetic patients.

Insulin-dependent patients with type 2 diabetes saw a significant drop in their blood sugar levels after wearing Abbott Laboratories Inc\u2019s continuous glucose monitoring system for three months compared with when they were not using the device, researchers said on Saturday.  The study, which was presented at the American Diabetes Association meeting in San Francisco, assessed the medical records of 363 type 2 diabetics in France, Germany and Austria between three and six months.  Dr. Helene Hanaire of the University Hospital Center of Toulouse, France, one of the study authors, said having ready access to their blood glucose readings helped diabetics become more engaged with controlling their glucose levels.  Patients in the study, whose average age was 63, used multiple insulin injections every day over an average of more than eight years.  An analysis of patient records found that patients who used Abbott\u2019s FreeStyle Libre - a device worn on the body that monitors blood sugar continuously through a sensor under the skin - helped patients reduce hemoglobin A1c by nearly 1%.  Hemoglobin A1c levels is a measure of a person\u2019s average blood sugar for three months and indicates the risk for developing long-term complications from diabetes.  Patients who used the device for at least three months saw their A1c levels drop to an average of 8%, from the previous level of 8.9%, when they did not use the device. However, this was still above the American Diabetes Association\u2019s recommended target of 7%.  Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, and many patients can keep their blood sugar within the recommended range with oral medications and do not need insulin. However, those on insulin require regular monitoring of blood sugar levels.  Abbott\u2019s FreeStyle Libre, which can be worn for up to 14 days, reduces the need for the traditional fingerstick testing.","100":"A U.S. appeals court on Friday granted patent monetization company Rembrandt IP Management a new trial in an infringement case it brought against an Abbott Laboratories diagnostic testing subsidiary.

On Thursday, the $50 billion discount retailer reported an almost 19% second-quarter increase in same-store sales from the same period last year, crushing the average analyst estimate by over 3 percentage points. While its share price has slipped from a record high, it\u2019s still up around 30% this year, outpacing Walmart.  It\u2019s clearly benefitting from 2020 anxiety. Store traffic may have fallen, but average transaction totals rose. Quarantines led consumers to stock up on essentials, while a severe economic contraction left millions out of work or worried about money. Its rival Dollar Tree \u2013 which is about half its size \u2013 also outperformed quarterly sales estimates, though with more modest results.  Granted, panic-shopping is likely to subside.

Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 14 day system, which is used to identify continuous glucose levels, trends, and an eight-hour history of glucose patterns in diabetes patients, is pictured in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters July 15, 2019. Abbott\/Handout via REUTERS  Abbott executives said the increase in manufacturing capacity will begin in the second half of this year and make room for the expected U.S. launch of the FreeStyle Libre 2. This next-generation device has been approved in Europe and is now under U.S. regulatory review.  Abbott\u2019s plans for Libre, its fastest-growing diabetes product, used by 1.5 million people worldwide, will be in focus when the company reports quarterly earnings on Wednesday.  Jared Watkin, Abbott\u2019s senior vice president for Diabetes Care, said in an interview that scale is a \u201chuge part\u201d of the company\u2019s strategy for its glucose monitors. \u201cWhen you\u2019re making disposable diagnostic products, the more you can make, the lower the cost you can produce them at.\u201d  While the Libre 2 has more features, including alarms for when blood sugar levels swing too low or high, Abbott plans to keep the U.S. price the same as its predecessor, Watkin said.  Abbott started in diabetes care as a maker of inexpensive test strips and glucose meters. More recently, the company has sought to expand access to its so-called continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices - traditionally sold to type 1 diabetics in markets with generous insurance coverage.  \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough to bring this to a small, wealthy population. Diabetes is such a global epidemic that you need to bring products that can really make a dent in that,\u201d Watkin said.  Launched in Europe in 2014 and in the United States three years later, the FreeStyle Libre allows people with diabetes to track blood sugar levels without multiple daily finger sticks.  A sensor attached to the back of the upper arm uses a thin filament under the skin to measure glucose every minute. Users check their blood sugar levels throughout the day by waving a reader, or smartphone, over the sensor. Major competitors Medtronic Plc MDT.N and Dexcom Inc DXCM.O critique the current Libre's lack of automatic alerts that can help diabetics manage their disease. Yet they also are taking steps to introduce cheaper models themselves, executives told Reuters.  Libre\u2019s sales are expected to reach $1.5 billion this year, the company said. In April, Goldman Sachs estimated the global CGM market could reach $5 billion by 2021, up from $3.7 billion in 2019. Goldman projected Abbott\u2019s 2021 sales at $2.7 billion compared to $1.7 billion for Dexcom and $894 million for Medtronic.  \u2018SCRATCHING THE SURFACE\u2019  In the past, CGMs were used almost exclusively by type 1 diabetics, whose bodies do not make insulin and who must inject themselves with the blood-sugar regulating hormone to survive.  Increasingly, people with type 2 diabetes - the kind driven by obesity, lack of exercise and genetics - must also closely monitor their blood glucose and use insulin to manage their disease when it is not controlled by other medications and lifestyle changes.  For now, Libre users include 1 million type 1 diabetic patients and half a million type 2. That\u2019s a tiny sliver of the 425 million people with diabetes worldwide.  Although not all diabetics need glucose monitors, \u201cthere is an element of scratching the surface at this point,\u201d Watkin said. \u201cThe need to invest and bring up capacity is, we believe, going to be an ongoing activity for us.\u201d  Two 14-day Libre sensors, a month\u2019s supply, retail for $109. Abbott says most of its patients are commercially insured, and many pay as little as $10 out of pocket.  In the United States, the company says, more than half of people in commercial health plans are covered, as well as any eligible diabetic person on Medicare, the federal program for the elderly and disabled. The device is also approved in 45 other countries, including Germany, Japan, Brazil, China and the United Arab Emirates.  Medtronic told Reuters it offers a discounted price of $345 per month for uninsured patients. The company estimates that the typical insured patient pays $50 a month. Medicare does not cover the device.  Dexcom\u2019s G6 sensors retail online, with a discount, at around $350 for a month\u2019s supply. Dexcom says 98 percent of all U.S. private insurers cover the device, and patients covered by commercial insurance pay an average of $50-$80 per month for sensors through pharmacies or durable medical equipment suppliers. It is covered by Medicare.  Libre\u2019s 14-day sensor is also longer-lasting. Dexcom\u2019s sensors work for 10 days, and Medtronic\u2019s for up to 7. Abbott was also the first company to introduce a product that can be used without routine finger stick tests to validate the sensor\u2019s readings \u2013 a feature Dexcom later matched and Medtronic has not.  Dr. Roy Beck, an endocrinologist at the Jaeb Center for Health Research in Tampa, Florida, said that Abbott's FreeStyle Libre is \"an excellent sensor\" but not as accurate at detecting very low blood sugar as the devices from Dexcom, Medtronic or an implantable CGM made by Senseonics SENS.A.  That makes it less desirable for patients for whom this is a major issue, he said. Beck\u2019s center has received research funding from Abbott and Dexcom.  Medtronic and Dexcom executives say the current Libre does not compare with their devices when it comes to features such as alerting users to dangerous blood sugar changes and providing comprehensive trend data.  \u201cIt\u2019s the cheapest, but it\u2019s not exactly in the same category,\u201d said Mike Hill, vice president and general manager of Medtronic\u2019s sensor business.  Abbott countered that its sensor has best-in-class accuracy, and noted that the next-generation Libre 2 does have optional alarms.  Still, Medtronic is considering making a cheaper sensor for patients who don't need all the features of its current continuous monitor, Hill said. And next year, Dexcom plans to launch a cheaper, smaller, 14-day sensor developed in partnership with Verily, Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O life sciences division.  Dexcom Chief Executive Kevin Sayer acknowledged that Abbott\u2019s pricing strategy will affect the global market over time, and that Dexcom expects its own prices to come down. \u201cWe\u2019ve planned for this,\u201d he said.","107":"FILE PHOTO: A woman holds a small bottle labeled with a \"Vaccine COVID-19\" sticker and a medical syringe in this illustration taken April 10, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories said on Monday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued an emergency use authorization for its lab-based COVID-19 antibody blood test.  The test, AdviseDx, can be used to identify a type of antibody called Immunoglobulin M (IgM) in blood samples to determine if someone has been exposure to the novel coronavirus, potentially indicating a recent or prior infection.  Abbott has already received emergency use authorization for seven tests, including molecular tests, a rapid antigen test and another test which can detect a type of antibody called IgG.  The FDA\u2019s emergency use authorization allows the use of unapproved medical products in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases with no adequate or approved alternatives.  IgG is longer lasting in the body after an infection, but IgM is more useful for determining a recent exposure to the coronavirus as these antibodies become undetectable weeks to months following an infection, Abbott said here.  Unlike molecular tests, which can detect whether someone has the coronavirus, antibody tests determine if someone has had a previous infection by detecting disease-fighting proteins called antibodies.  However, antibody tests are not recommended as the sole basis of diagnosis of COVID-19 as these antibodies may not be detected in the early days of the infection.

FILE PHOTO: An Abbott company logo is pictured at the reception of its office in Mumbai, India, September 8, 2015. REUTERS\/Shailesh Andrade\/File Photo  Some analysts also said a 6.9 percent rise in organic sales, which excludes the impact of foreign currency and certain divestitures and acquisitions, was just shy of a roughly 7 percent expected by investors.  Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S had no consensus estimate for the organic sales.  Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy said the miss \u201cmay limit upside to the shares today despite an otherwise very good quarter.\u201d Several other analysts said the company had failed to meet heightened expectations among investors.  Abbott shares fell 2.7 percent to trade at $58.22 mid-morning in New York.  On a reported basis, Abbott\u2019s sales rose 16.7 percent to $7.39 billion, beating consensus expectations of $7.29 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Excluding items, Abbott reported a profit of 59 cents per share against expectations of 58 cents per share.  The company reiterated its full-year 2018 forecast of adjusted earnings from continuing operation between $2.80 to $2.90 per share.  \u201cIt\u2019s all about the expectations,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar said, saying that investors may have been disappointed that the healthcare company only maintained its full-year profit forecast.  The company\u2019s first-quarter results were helped by launches of new medical devices and a turnaround in its business that sells baby and adult nutritional supplements. Sales across all the company\u2019s business units, except in its established pharmaceuticals business, beat expectations.  The established pharmaceuticals, which sells generic drugs in emerging growth countries such as India, raked in sales of 1.04 billion, but missed analysts\u2019 consensus estimates of $1.08 billion.  The weak sales were due to a slowing market growth rate in Russia, Chief Executive Miles White said on a conference call.  \u201cWe seem to have a given market that affects our established pharmaceuticals or even our nutrition business from time to time somewhere. And in this particular case, it\u2019s Russia,\u201d White said.  The company reported net earnings of $418 million, or 23 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, compared to $419 million, or 24 cents per share, a year earlier.  Profit from Abbott\u2019s medical device business - its largest division - continued to benefit from its $25 billion purchase of St. Jude Medical, and from new device launches. Sales for the unit rose 14.6 percent to $2.74 billion in the quarter.","117":"(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories ABT.N missed analysts' estimates for fourth-quarter revenue on Wednesday due to lower sales of its generic drugs in emerging markets as well as a strong dollar, and also forecast current-quarter profit below expectations.  Shares of the Chicago-based company were down 2.1 percent at $70.02 in afternoon trading.  \u201cI know the world worries about the volatility of those markets and the reliability of those markets, and in particular, currency,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Miles White said on a conference call.  He added he thought the underlying growth rates in emerging markets were solid, and that the company could power through the \u201cwindiness of the currency markets.\u201d  A strengthening dollar is expected to hurt profits at large medical device makers that derive a large chunk of their revenue from outside the United States.  Abbott said it expects adjusted earnings of 60 cents to 62 cents per share in the first quarter, below estimates of 64 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  \u201cSome may look at these results and guidance as nothing too special, especially since Abbott had a lower tax rate than what we were anticipating, which helped this quarter\u2019s results,\u201d Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said.  Abbott forecast full-year organic sales growth in the range of 6.5 percent to 7.5 percent, after posting a 7.3 percent organic sales growth in 2018.  Cowen and Co analyst Joshua Jennings said he is optimistic that Abbott can continue to generate above consensus results in 2019, given the consistency and strength of its top-line growth.  Fourth-quarter sales in the company\u2019s pharmaceuticals unit, which sells generic drugs in countries such as India and China, fell 4.8 percent to $1.09 billion, while analysts on average had expected $1.16 billion.  A better-than-expected 6.7 percent rise in sales at the medical device segment, its largest, partly lifted the overall sales by 2.3 percent to $7.77 billion, but missed expectation of $7.82 billion.  The company posted net earnings of $654 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $828 million a year earlier, when it had taken a $1.4 billion charge related to the U.S. tax overhaul.  Excluding items, the company earned 81 cents per share, in line with estimates.","118":"May 14 (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories:  * ABBOTT PROVIDES UPDATE ON ID NOW\u2122  * SEEING STUDIES BEING CONDUCTED TO UNDERSTAND ROLE OF ID NOW IN WAYS THAT IT WAS NOT DESIGNED TO BE USED  * NYU STUDY RESULTS ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH OTHER STUDIES  * SEEN A FEW STUDIES WITH SENSITIVITY PERFORMANCE PERCENTAGES IN 80S, ALSO SEEN OTHER STUDIES WITH SENSITIVITY AT OR ABOVE 90% Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","119":"Sept 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. government will send an \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of the rapid COVID-19 tests it purchased from Abbott Laboratories last week to governors of U.S. states and territories to support school reopening and other critical tasks, an administration official said at a press briefing.
