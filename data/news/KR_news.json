Kroger agreed to sell its nearly 800 convenience stores to EG Group for $2.15 billion, the US supermarket chain said last week, just days after EG closed a 2.85 billion euro equivalent loan financing to fund its acquisition of over 2,000 Esso sites in Italy and Germany and refinance existing debt.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and UBS are leading the latest debt financing and are expected to be joined by other banks, the sources said.  The financing will comprise around $1.9 billion of term loans, of which around $200 million will be denominated in euros, as well as approximately $500 million of second-lien loans, the sources said.  The loans will launch for syndication to institutional investors in the next two to three weeks and will mainly target US-based investors, the sources said.  EG Group\u2019s existing 281 million euro equivalent multi-currency revolving credit facility is also set to increase, given the company has grown as a result of the acquisition, the sources said.  DEBT-FUELLED  The Kroger acquisition will be financed entirely with debt as EG Group\u2019s existing credit agreement enables EG Group to do so.  \u201cIt shows that the company is extremely ambitious, doing the acquisition with no equity,\u201d a syndicate head said. \u201cInvestors will be looking at the pro forma-ing very closely, they\u2019ll look at pro forma and see if falls within existing docs. The owners have already taken out a big dividend and have very little left invested \u2013 does that feel like the right risk\/reward?\u201d  While some investors have expressed displeasure with a new financing launching so soon after the last financing closed, other investors are attracted to the opportunity of deploying further amounts of capital into a well-liked, strong performing credit.  Although investors cant stop the company from funding the Kroger acquisition entirely with debt, they can choose not to invest in the new debt or sell out of their existing positions in the secondary loan market, sources said.  However, EG Group\u2019s term loans have remained fairly flat in secondary since the Kroger acquisition was announced, notwithstanding last week\u2019s volatility from wider macro-economic conditions that saw a softening of many credits.  \u201cSome investors were not so excited to find out about a new deal so soon after an old deal, however, secondary has been stable which suggests buyside is supportive. By definition the company still needs to raise debt so that is the opportunity for the lenders to talk, but if lenders were really worried about the acquisition then secondary levels would have dipped,\u201d a second syndicate head said.  EG Group priced its 2.85 billion euro of loan facilities at the beginning of February. That deal included a 1.985 billion euro term loan B paying 400bp over Euribor with a 99.5 OID; a 400 million pounds term loan B priced at 475bp over Libor with a 99.75 OID; and a $500 million TLB priced at 400bp over Libor with a 99.75 discount.  There was also a 385 million euro unfunded letter of credit paying 200bp over Euribor and a 281 million euro-equivalent multi-currency revolving credit facility paying 300bp over Euribor\/Libor.  All facilities have a 0 percent floor.  TDR acquired a 1.3 billion pounds minority stake in EG Group, formerly known as Euro Garages, in January 2016, backed by a 745 million pounds financing split between a 370 million pounds seven-year TLB and a 250 million pounds equivalent euro-denominated TLB.","6":"July 1 (Reuters) - The healthcare unit of U.S. supermarket chain Kroger Co said on Wednesday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had issued Emergency Use Authorization for its at-home sample collection kit for COVID-19.  The kits will be available to frontline workers across its companies beginning this week, Kroger said, adding that it plans to expand availability to other companies in the coming weeks, with a goal of processing up to 60,000 tests per week by the end of July.

Kroger previously had followed local and state laws on the matter, she said.","8":"LONDON (Reuters) - British online grocer Ocado OCDO.L said on Tuesday that Kroger KR.N, its most important partner, had made good progress identifying locations for the first of at least 20 sites to build automated warehouses in the United States.  FILE PHOTO: Delivery vans are lined up prior to dispatch at the Ocado CFC (Customer Fulfilment Centre) in Andover, Britain May 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Peter Nicholls  In May, the U.S. supermarket group struck a deal with Ocado to ratchet up its delivery business with the construction of robotically operated warehouses, upping the ante in its battle with Amazon AMZN.O.  The Kroger deal is Ocado's biggest yet, exceeding all of the centers the firm has built or plans to build with Morrisons MRW.L in Britain, Casino CASP.PA in France, Sobeys EMPa.TO in Canada and ICA Group ICAA.ST in Sweden.  Kroger is working to identify the first three sites for warehouses, which typically take two years to open.  \u201cThey\u2019re making good progress identifying which particular sites and which particular cities. And we\u2019re making good progress working on the details of the commercial relationship,\u201d Duncan Tatton-Brown, Ocado\u2019s chief financial officer told reporters, without naming the locations.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work going on because even though the final deal (service agreement) isn\u2019t agreed we are actually being paid. So nothing is holding us up,\u201d he said.  Online grocery shopping is growing rapidly, but companies are still grappling with the challenge of how to make money from taking goods at different temperatures to customers\u2019 doors.  Ocado\u2019s experience of developing a high-tech distribution system has helped its progress toward sustainable profit growth, with its shares up more than 200 percent over the last year thanks to four major overseas technology partnership deals.  The stock rose as much as 4.8 percent on Tuesday after Ocado reported third-quarter retail revenue growth in line with full-year guidance and said it had ramped up capacity in Britain with the opening of its fourth robotic warehouse this summer at Erith, near London.  The stock was up 39.2 pence at 951.8 pence at 0925 GMT, valuing the business at 6.4 billion pounds ($8.4 billion).  \u201cWe think there is a great deal for management to now execute on and thus see a low likelihood of another major deal in the near term,\u201d said RBC Europe analyst Sherri Malek.  Ocado said Erith processed over 20,000 orders last week, 14 weeks after opening, a number its third warehouse in Andover, southern England, took 15 months to achieve.  BIGGEST CHALLENGE  Retail revenue rose 11.5 percent to 348.6 million pounds in the 13 weeks to Sept. 2, having climbed 11.7 percent in the first half. In July Ocado forecast retail revenue growth of 10-15 percent for the full year.  \u201cMost of our competitors would die for a sales growth where we are,\u201d said the finance chief.  Industry data also published on Tuesday showed sales at Britain\u2019s four biggest grocers rose in a range of 1.6 to 3.1 percent in the latest 12-week period.  Tatton-Brown said Ocado\u2019s biggest challenge currently was hiring enough people to keep up with the business\u2019 growth.  \u201cWe\u2019re hiring but we\u2019d probably like to hire a bit faster,\u201d he said.  Prior to Tuesday\u2019s update, analysts\u2019 average forecast was for Ocado to make a 2018 pretax loss of 30 million pounds and core earnings (EBITDA) of 73 million pounds. That compares with a loss of 500,000 pounds and core earnings of 84.3 million pounds in 2017.

FILE PHOTO: The Kroger supermarket chain's headquarters is shown in Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S., June 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Lisa Baertlein  In the face of growing competition in the U.S. grocery space, recently disrupted by online retail giant Amazon.com AMZN.O, Cincinnati-based Kroger has taken a series of steps to boost its sales, including slashing prices.  Sales fell 1.2% last year, but analysts expect it to rise 1.1% in 2019.  Under its two-year-old \u201cRestock Kroger\u201d program, the company has been focusing on private-label brand display, rearranging store layouts and expanding home delivery and self checkouts services.  When it announced the program in 2017, Kroger had planned $9 billion in capital investments over three years and had forecast $400 million in incremental operating profit by 2020.  But the company in September raised doubts about its profit targets, shaking investor confidence in its plan.  Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip told analysts on Tuesday that lower pharmacy gross margins, higher wage investments and delayed sales momentum led Kroger to not reconfirm its 2019 operating profit forecast last quarter.  \u201cWe are clear-eyed about what worked and what didn\u2019t,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Rodney McMullen said.  The company has set aside $3.2 billion and $3.4 billion in capital investments for next year mainly for driving profitable sales growth in physical and online stores and the rollout of its first Ocado warehouse facility that will go live in 2021.  Kroger last year bought a stake in Ocado OCDO.L, an online grocer, and struck an exclusive deal for the U.S. market.  \u201cWhen you look at grocery, it really is in a big state of flux... I think Kroger is doing a very aggressive, very smart job,\u201d said Phil Lempert, an expert on retail food trends who advises companies on food branding and consumer behavior.  Kroger also said it would waive pick-up fee for online orders in some stores, as it tries to keep up with competition who offer similar options for consumers to order groceries on their app and collect from stores.  The supermarket chain forecast 2020 adjusted profit between $2.30 and $2.40 per share, and identical sales growth, excluding fuel, to be greater than 2.25%.  Analysts are expecting the company to earn $2.30 per share in 2020 and report same-store sales growth of 1.99%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.","10":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Blue Apron APRN.N climbed on Thursday after Kroger said it was buying Home Chef to broaden its menu in the home meal kit market while stock of Calavo Growers, whose unit partnered with Kroger on another meal kit service, slumped.  FILE PHOTO: The Blue Apron logo is pictured ahead of the company's IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in New York, U.S., June 29, 2017. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  Supermarket chain Kroger Co KR.N said late on Wednesday it would pay $200 million for Home Chef, and up to $500 million more if the service reaches targets for in-store and online sales of its personalized food kits.  Kroger\u2019s purchase of Home Chef sent shares of meal-kit pioneer Blue Apron Holdings 3.2 percent higher in trading on Thursday.  Speculation it could be acquired has pepped up Blue Apron\u2019s stock in the past, although the shares remain down 70 percent since the company\u2019s initial public offering last June, with Wall Street worried about competition from Amazon.com and other retail heavyweights.  Calavo Growers CVGW.O, an avocado distributor that through a subsidiary partnered with Kroger on another meal kit service, slumped nearly 8 percent. Prep+Pared, which Kroger launched last year in partnership with FreshRealm, a supply chain startup partly owned by Calavo Growers, could fall by the wayside following the acquisition of Home Chef, analysts said.  \u201cThis acquisition should allow Kroger to gain new customers nationally, capture share in its existing markets (approximately 60 million shoppers), leverage existing vendor relationships, and complement (or replace) its existing meal kit business, Prep+Pared,\u201d wrote Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman in a note to clients.  Blue Apron launched the meal-kit market, selling subscriptions for pre-portioned ingredients paired with recipes for restaurant-style meals like tilapia piccata and miso-glazed barramundi, but has faced growing numbers of competitors.  Home Chef increased its sales by 150 percent last year and offers more meal variety than competitors, according to Kroger.  In March, Walmart Inc WMT.N launched its own kits, priced between $8 and $15 per meal.  Kroger\u2019s stock was down 0.25 percent at $24.50.","11":"FILE PHOTO: The Kroger supermarket chain's headquarters is shown in Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S., June 28, 2018.

Turkey Hill, which has nearly 800 workers, produces milk, ice creams, frozen dairy treats, iced teas and fruit drinks.  The unit was not part of the sale of Kroger\u2019s convenience stores business to British gas station operator EG Group for $2.15 billion earlier this year.  The sale of the convenience stores, which had $4 billion in annual revenue, was part of Cincinnati-based Kroger\u2019s \u201cRe-stock\u201d plan that aimed to revamp its nearly 2,800 brick-and-mortar supermarkets, cut prices and boost in-store technology.  Turkey Hill distributes frozen dairy desserts and drinks in 49 U.S. states, excluding Hawaii, and owns a manufacturing and distribution facility in Conestoga, Pennsylvania.  The company said it had hired Goldman Sachs & Co LLC to review and evaluate the options for Turkey Hill, which has been owned by Kroger since 1985.","13":"March 1 (Reuters) - U.S. supermarket chain Kroger Co on Friday said its Smith\u2019s Food and Drug Stores division will stop accepting Visa Inc\u2019s credit cards, starting April 3, because of excessive transaction fees.  Kroger had stopped accepting Visa\u2019s credit cards at its Foods Co stores in California in August last year, because of a price dispute over interchange rates and network fees.  \"At Smith's, Visa's credit card fees are higher than any other credit card brand that we accept. Visa's excessive fees and unfairness cannot continue to go unchecked,\" Kroger's Chief Financial Officer Mike Schlotman said reut.rs\/2NzW0oi.  The company added it is going to continue to explore other options to reduce the cost of accepting credit cards and keep prices low for customers.  Smith\u2019s operates over 130 stores across the U.S.  The dispute between Kroger and Visa is the latest between payments processors and merchants over transaction fees. Card companies have said in the past that expenses for ramping up anti-fraud\/anti-theft security measures to make payment processing safer have resulted in a fee hike.  Mastercard and Visa have another round of fee hikes, slated for April, which will be levied on merchant banks, not on the merchants directly, although the banks could pass on the fee hike to sellers, if they want to avoid absorbing it themselves.  Visa was not immediately available for a comment outside working hours.  Smith\u2019s stores will continue to accept all other forms of payment, including major credit cards, and health savings account cards.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  The test of Nuro\u2019s \u201cR1\u201d van, which is shaped like a rounded, silver lunch box, comes as Kroger and other store-based food retailers are racing to catch up with or gain an advantage over online retailer Amazon.com Inc, which sent grocery sellers scrambling to add home delivery after its $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market last year.  Kroger is experimenting with ways to lower the cost of grocery delivery by automating different labor- and cost-intensive aspects of the service, from picking and packing orders to dropping them at homes. Just last month, it struck a deal with British online grocer Ocado to build highly automated warehouses.  Kroger Chief Executive Officer Rodney McMullen told Reuters that the non-exclusive partnership with Nuro, announced ahead of the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Thursday, will help shape the grocer\u2019s strategy for giving shoppers at its 2,800 stores in 35 states \u201canything, anytime and anywhere.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s one more piece of that puzzle,\u201d McMullen said of the Nuro test. No money exchanged hands and the location of the test city has yet to be announced.  Nuro said it is in the process of gaining regulatory approval for the project.  Nuro co-founder Dave Ferguson called the battery-operated R1 a \u201cconsiderate, conservative\u201d road user. It is half the width and about two-thirds the length of a Toyota Corolla and will travel at a maximum speed of 25 miles per hour, he said.  The R1 is larger than the slow-speed sidewalk delivery robots that Starship Technologies has been testing in cities around the world and, unlike many other driverless vehicles, it has no seats for humans.  Customers in the test market will have the option to select driverless delivery when they order groceries from their local Kroger supermarket\u2019s website. Kroger and Nuro will tell users when R1 leaves the store and give updates on its journey. They also will provide a code to open the compartment containing their order.  Kroger offers its own delivery service in Denver and works with a broad variety of third-party providers in other markets. Delivery is popular, in part, because it takes the effort and hassle out of carrying bulky or heavy items like large packages of toilet paper or cases of bottled water to and from a car and into the home \u2013 something Nuro vans will not do.

The 135-year-old company is experimenting with a variety of technologies as it battles Amazon.com and Walmart Inc to find a profitable formula to serve customers who want milk and eggs whisked to their doorsteps. These shoppers are a tiny but fast-growing segment of the $800-billion U.S. grocery market. Kroger must win them over to survive.  \u201cWe want to serve the customer on their terms,\u201d said Chief Executive Rodney McMullen, who for years has kept tabs on the economics of grocery delivery. \u201cFor us, every penny counts.\u201d  In a series of interviews with Reuters at Kroger headquarters in Cincinnati, McMullen and other executives outlined a host of experiments and initiatives. These include self-driving delivery vans, third-party delivery contractors and curbside pickup in Kroger parking lots. Most of these efforts are an attempt to leverage one of the company\u2019s most valuable assets: brick-and-mortar stores located within a mile or two of most of its current customers.  But Kroger is breaking with that familiar model for its next big push. It is betting big on giant warehouses staffed with fast robots to pack orders straight for delivery to shoppers.  In May, Kroger paid roughly $248 million for a minority stake in Ocado, a British company whose newest machines can pull together a 50-item grocery order in as little as five minutes. That technology leapfrogs what is currently in use by any retailer in the United States. It has turned Ocado into the world\u2019s No. 1 online grocer, serving 679,000 active customers in the United Kingdom without operating a single supermarket.  This year Kroger and Ocado will pick U.S. sites for the first three of 20 planned high-tech warehouses, known as \u201csheds,\u201d that take a couple of years to build, Kroger executives said. They declined to name locations, but said Kroger plans to break into at least one new area where it does not have existing stores.  Industry veterans said Kroger\u2019s partnership with Ocado was a bold move that positions the company, which posted 2017 sales of $123 billion, to grab share from younger players seen as nimbler and more innovative.  \u201cThis will be a game-changer ... and probably the most likely catalyst for grocery e-commerce in the U.S. to take off,\u201d said London-based Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne, a former e-commerce executive at British food seller Tesco.  Kroger executives would not say whether they will use their own drivers or outsource delivery from the sheds.  Meanwhile, the company has teamed up with Silicon Valley self-driving startup Nuro to test a driverless delivery van in Phoenix. And Kroger continues to invest in curbside pickup.  Earlier this month it launched a beefed-up online shopping service called Kroger Ship that sends packages directly from its distribution centers via United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp.  But competitors are not sitting still.  Walmart, which waged a brutal price war to become the top U.S. grocery seller, recently launched its own self-driving car project. Later this year it will begin testing automated grocery picking at a supercenter in Salem, New Hampshire.  Amazon, meanwhile, already sells more non-perishable groceries online than any other retailer. It spent $13.7 billion last year to acquire the Whole Foods supermarket chain with an eye to turning those stores into distribution hubs to bolster its AmazonFresh delivery service. The company just launched curbside pickup at Whole Foods, starting with stores in Sacramento, California and Virginia Beach, Virginia.  DEMAND DILEMMA  It is all largely a bet on the future.  Analysts say online grocery purchases currently account for just 1 percent to 4 percent of U.S. industry sales. Three-quarters of online shoppers surveyed said they rarely or never buy groceries that way, according to a new Reuters\/Ipsos telephone poll of nearly 6,000 adults fielded from June 26 to July 11.  (For a look at why U.S. shoppers are not buying groceries online, see: tmsnrt.rs\/2LYQUUV)  Investment in automation has spurred faster growth overseas. Online grocery sales account for 5.6 percent of the market in the United Kingdom and 3.8 percent in China, compared to 1 percent in the United States, according to market research firm IGD Retail.  Kroger is letting go of old models that have proven unprofitable.  Chief Financial Officer Mike Schlotman revealed for the first time that the company never made money on Home Shop, a roughly 30-year-old delivery service it shuttered in April. Kroger offered it in just 20 stores in the company\u2019s King Soopers division in the Rocky Mountain area, for prices ranging from $10.95 for an internet order to $20.90 for telephone orders. That was not enough to cover the cost of labor and the expense of operating a fleet of refrigerated trucks.  \u201cIt\u2019s highly inefficient to do that out of a store. You can\u2019t get the critical mass you need,\u201d Schlotman said.  Kroger replaced Home Shop with Instacart, one of a handful of third-party delivery firms that now serve more than 1,200 Kroger stores.  Monteyne, the supermarket analyst, said Kroger\u2019s new delivery push is a recognition of the value of online shoppers. These customers crave convenience and tend to spend more per order than those who just drop by the supermarket for a few items. The \u201cfirst-mover\u201d advantage is key to locking them in.  That is how Kroger lost Cincinnati shopper Alene Annan, 50. Tired of hauling dog food and Diet Coke up two flights of steps to her home, she switched to Meijer Inc, which was among the first stores to offer delivery in her area.  Still, she said she is open to switching back to Kroger when its new service is ready.  \u201cThey just have to make it easy,\u201d Annan said.","26":"March 23 (Reuters) - Department store operator Target Corp and grocery chain Kroger Co are in talks about a possible merger, tech focused magazine Fast Company reported on Friday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

Walmart also called for a strengthening of background checks for gun buyers and action to take guns out of the hands of those who pose a risk of violence, which was followed by an almost identical message from grocery operator Kroger Co.  Both Walmart and Kroger, which exited the firearms and ammunition business last year when its Fred Meyer unit stopped such sales, said they are now asking customers not to bring guns into their stores, even when allowed by local laws.  The two retailers are among a growing number of U.S. companies, such as Delta Air Lines and Bank of America, that are responding to the debate over guns and gun safety as mass shootings have proliferated, risking backlash from powerful gun owners\u2019 groups while elected leaders consider options.  \u201cIt\u2019s clear to us that the status quo is unacceptable,\u201d Walmart\u2019s chief executive officer, Doug McMillon, said in a letter to employees. \u201cAs a company, we experienced two horrific events in one week, and we will never be the same.\u201d  Kroger, in a statement from corporate affairs vice president Jessica Adelman, spoke about \u201cthe growing chorus of Americans who are no longer comfortable with the status quo and who are advocating for concrete and common sense gun reforms.\u201d  Kroger said it was \u201cjoining those encouraging our elected leaders to pass laws\u201d on background checks and keeping firearms out of the hands of those at risk for violence.  McMillon said Walmart\u2019s decision follows his visit to El Paso, Texas, on Aug. 6, three days after a gunman went on a rampage at a Walmart store there, killing 22 people.  Walmart Inc said it would stop selling ammunition for handguns and some assault-style rifles in all its stores across the United States. McMillon in the letter described himself as a gun owner and said that company founder Sam Walton was \u201can avid outdoorsman who had a passion for quail hunting.\u201d  Walmart will stop selling handgun sales in Alaska, the only state where it still sells hand guns. The halt on the ammunition and handgun sales will come into effect when current inventory is sold out.  Kroger had sold guns in 43 of its Fred Meyer stores in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska before announcing in March 2018 that it would exit the firearms business.  PRAISE AND CRITICISM  The retailers\u2019 latest moves sparked immediate reaction from groups on both sides of the gun control debate.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cThe tide is turning,\u201d said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, a gun control advocacy group. The announcements \u201csend a strong cultural signal that when lawmakers don\u2019t protect their constituents, companies will protect their customers.\u201d  The National Rifle Association (NRA), a pro-gun group with deep political ties, said Walmart was succumbing to pressure from \u201canti-gun elites.\u201d  \u201cLines at Walmart will soon be replaced by lines at other retailers who are more supportive of America\u2019s fundamental freedoms,\u201d it said. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Kroger move.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Walmart said its latest actions would reduce its share of the ammunition market from around 20% to a range of about 6% to 9%, and would trend toward the lower end of that range over time.  U.S. gun and ammunition stores had total sales of about $11 billion last year, of which 19% was ammunition, according to market research firm IBISWorld.  The move reflects growing corporate activism on guns.  Walmart, like rival Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, had previously ended sales of assault rifles and raised the minimum age for gun purchases to 21.  Bank of America last year said it would no longer lend to companies making military-style firearms for civilians, and airlines Delta and United last year said they were no longer offering discounted rates to the NRA.  The latest move will leave Walmart focused on weapons for hunting, including deer rifles, shotguns and related ammunition.  \u201cThe general principle is if we don\u2019t sell the firearm we wouldn\u2019t sell the ammunition,\u201d a spokesman for Walmart told Reuters.  Just last month, Walmart said it would not change its policy on selling firearms even as it took down signs and playable demos of violent video games.  On Friday, McMillon in his letter to employees said he would send letters urging action on \u201ccommon sense measures\u201d to the White House and the Congressional leadership, calling for debate of the reauthorization of a ban on assault weapons, to determine its effectiveness, as well.","30":"Sept 13 (Reuters) - Kroger Co missed quarterly same-store sales estimates on Thursday, as disruptions caused by the supermarket chain changing the way it stocks merchandise on shelves kept some customers away from its stores.

Their move comes weeks after Walmart Inc said it was pulling the plug on e-cigarette sales, citing growing federal, state and local regulatory complexity and uncertainty.  E-cigarettes and other vaping products have been linked to a mysterious lung illness that is reported to have led to 18 deaths as of last week, with the number of confirmed and probable cases of the condition exceeding 1,000, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Kroger said it would discontinue sales of e-cigarettes at its stores and fuel centers after selling through its current inventory.  Walgreens said it had decided to stop selling e-cigarette products at its U.S. stores as the CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other health officials continue to examine the issue.

Kroger\u2019s price-earnings ratio has tumbled to 11.5 times future earnings, from 18.8 times in early 2016, Barron\u2019s said.  That puts it at a 30 percent discount compared with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index, and triple the average discount of about 9 percent over the past decade, Barron\u2019s said.  Spending to expand the digital business will weigh on Kroger\u2019s earnings in the current fiscal year, Barron\u2019s said, but analysts expect earnings to rise 14 percent two years from now.  Kroger\u2019s market share has risen about 2 percentage points since 2009, and hit 10.3 percent last year, placing it second behind Walmart Inc and Sam\u2019s Club, which have a combined 21.2 percent, Barron\u2019s said.  Kroger faces competition from Walmart and Amazon.com , which spent $13.7 billion to acquire Whole Foods last year, as well as smaller chains that are offering more food, Barron\u2019s said.  But Kroger\u2019s large franchise includes 2,800 grocery stores under many brands, 800 convenience stories and several hundred jewelry outlets, Barron\u2019s said.  If the company can produce growth in the next fiscal year and investors decide to push the stock up to 14 times forward earnings, the stock could hit $30, producing a 25 percent return, including dividends, Barron\u2019s said.

(reut.rs\/38tj82t)  Kroger said the home-collection of nasal swab sample needs to be performed under the supervision of a licensed healthcare professional through video chat and the sample needs to be shipped overnight to a designated laboratory for processing.  The sample will be tested at the laboratory to detect parts of the coronavirus, which can be used to diagnose active infection with the virus. Most results will be confirmed in less than 72 hours, the company said.  The kit will initially be available in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Tennessee, Utah and Virginia. Additional states will be added in the coming weeks.  While self-sample collection helps reduce patient traffic at hospitals and minimize chances of infection for healthcare workers, experts have flagged concerns about whether patients can accurately collect samples on their own and ship them to labs.

The 135-year-old company is experimenting with a variety of technologies as it battles Amazon.com and Walmart Inc to find a profitable formula to serve customers who want milk and eggs whisked to their doorsteps. These shoppers are a tiny but fast-growing segment of the $800-billion U.S. grocery market. Kroger must win them over to survive.  \u201cWe want to serve the customer on their terms,\u201d said Chief Executive Rodney McMullen, who for years has kept tabs on the economics of grocery delivery. \u201cFor us, every penny counts.\u201d  In a series of interviews with Reuters at Kroger headquarters in Cincinnati, McMullen and other executives outlined a host of experiments and initiatives. These include self-driving delivery vans, third-party delivery contractors and curbside pickup in Kroger parking lots. Most of these efforts are an attempt to leverage one of the company\u2019s most valuable assets: brick-and-mortar stores located within a mile or two of most of its current customers.  But Kroger is breaking with that familiar model for its next big push. It is betting big on giant warehouses staffed with fast robots to pack orders straight for delivery to shoppers.  In May, Kroger paid roughly $248 million for a minority stake in Ocado, a British company whose newest machines can pull together a 50-item grocery order in as little as five minutes. That technology leapfrogs what is currently in use by any retailer in the United States. It has turned Ocado into the world\u2019s No. 1 online grocer, serving 679,000 active customers in the United Kingdom without operating a single supermarket.  This year Kroger and Ocado will pick U.S. sites for the first three of 20 planned high-tech warehouses, known as \u201csheds,\u201d that take a couple of years to build, Kroger executives said. They declined to name locations, but said Kroger plans to break into at least one new area where it does not have existing stores.  Industry veterans said Kroger\u2019s partnership with Ocado was a bold move that positions the company, which posted 2017 sales of $123 billion, to grab share from younger players seen as nimbler and more innovative.  \u201cThis will be a game-changer ... and probably the most likely catalyst for grocery e-commerce in the U.S. to take off,\u201d said London-based Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne, a former e-commerce executive at British food seller Tesco.  Kroger executives would not say whether they will use their own drivers or outsource delivery from the sheds.  Meanwhile, the company has teamed up with Silicon Valley self-driving startup Nuro to test a driverless delivery van in Phoenix. And Kroger continues to invest in curbside pickup.  Earlier this month it launched a beefed-up online shopping service called Kroger Ship that sends packages directly from its distribution centers via United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp.  But competitors are not sitting still.  Walmart, which waged a brutal price war to become the top U.S. grocery seller, recently launched its own self-driving car project. Later this year it will begin testing automated grocery picking at a supercenter in Salem, New Hampshire.  Amazon, meanwhile, already sells more non-perishable groceries online than any other retailer. It spent $13.7 billion last year to acquire the Whole Foods supermarket chain with an eye to turning those stores into distribution hubs to bolster its AmazonFresh delivery service. The company just launched curbside pickup at Whole Foods, starting with stores in Sacramento, California and Virginia Beach, Virginia.  DEMAND DILEMMA  It is all largely a bet on the future.  Analysts say online grocery purchases currently account for just 1 percent to 4 percent of U.S. industry sales. Three-quarters of online shoppers surveyed said they rarely or never buy groceries that way, according to a new Reuters\/Ipsos telephone poll of nearly 6,000 adults fielded from June 26 to July 11.  (For a look at why U.S. shoppers are not buying groceries online, see: tmsnrt.rs\/2LYQUUV)  Investment in automation has spurred faster growth overseas. Online grocery sales account for 5.6 percent of the market in the United Kingdom and 3.8 percent in China, compared to 1 percent in the United States, according to market research firm IGD Retail.  Kroger is letting go of old models that have proven unprofitable.  Chief Financial Officer Mike Schlotman revealed for the first time that the company never made money on Home Shop, a roughly 30-year-old delivery service it shuttered in April. Kroger offered it in just 20 stores in the company\u2019s King Soopers division in the Rocky Mountain area, for prices ranging from $10.95 for an internet order to $20.90 for telephone orders. That was not enough to cover the cost of labor and the expense of operating a fleet of refrigerated trucks.  \u201cIt\u2019s highly inefficient to do that out of a store. You can\u2019t get the critical mass you need,\u201d Schlotman said.  Kroger replaced Home Shop with Instacart, one of a handful of third-party delivery firms that now serve more than 1,200 Kroger stores.  Monteyne, the supermarket analyst, said Kroger\u2019s new delivery push is a recognition of the value of online shoppers. These customers crave convenience and tend to spend more per order than those who just drop by the supermarket for a few items. The \u201cfirst-mover\u201d advantage is key to locking them in.  That is how Kroger lost Cincinnati shopper Alene Annan, 50. Tired of hauling dog food and Diet Coke up two flights of steps to her home, she switched to Meijer Inc, which was among the first stores to offer delivery in her area.  Still, she said she is open to switching back to Kroger when its new service is ready.  \u201cThey just have to make it easy,\u201d Annan said.","46":"March 1 (Reuters) - Kroger Co:  * KROGER CO SAYS \u201cRAISING THE MINIMUM AGE TO 21 TO PURCHASE FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION IN ALL OF OUR FRED MEYER LOCATIONS THAT SELL FIREARMS\u201d  * KROGER - WILL NO LONGER ACCEPT ANY SPECIAL-ORDERS OF ASSAULT-STYLE RIFLES WEAPONS IN ALASKA  * KROGER - \u201cAS WE REFRESH STORES WE ARE OFTEN TRANSITIONING GUN DEPARTMENTS DUE TO SOFTER DEMAND AND CHANGING CUSTOMER PREFERENCES\u201d  * KROGER - IN RESPONSE TO EVENTS IN PARKLAND & ELSEWHERE, CO HAS \u201cTAKEN A HARD LOOK\u201d AT POLICIES, PROCEDURES FOR FIREARM SALES Further company coverage: (Reuters.Brief@thomsonreuters.com)","47":"Feb 14 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Friday said it has bought stock in Kroger Co, investing in one of the largest U.S. grocery chains as smaller rivals struggle.

Kroger Best \"Unicorn Swirl\" ice cream are pictured on a shelf in a Kroger in Columbia, South Carolina, U.S., June 20, 2019. REUTERS\/Leah Millis  BERLIN\/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Kroger Co has room to improve on sales and is looking to its Deluxe Unicorn Swirl ice cream and other store-brand products to boost growth, Chief Executive Rodney McMullen said on Thursday.  Multicolored, sparkly ice cream is an unlikely battleground in U.S. grocery stores. But Kroger Co believes trendy house-brand items like Unicorn Swirl will help it win market share from Walmart Inc, Aldi and Amazon.com Inc.  \u201cWe know we can do better when it comes to identical sales results,\u201d McMullen told analysts after Kroger posted quarterly same-store sales below Wall Street estimates, sending its shares down 2.5%.  The grocer\u2019s store-brand business was one of its most powerful tools, McMullen said.  Kroger\u2019s own brand sales for the quarter rose 3.3%. Unicorn ice cream, pork belly bites and artisan jerky were among 219 new store brand items that boosted sales by $225 million.  By churning out new house-brand items, Kroger hopes to tap into broad sales growth for private labels. The push comes as grocers compete fiercely on price and race to expand online ordering and delivery, an area where the biggest U.S. grocery chain has lagged.  Kroger added 1,022 \u201cown brand\u201d items in 2018, and each supermarket on average stocks more than 15,000 private-label products such as pet food, clothes, furniture, meal kits and office supplies. Kroger\u2019s 16 house brands account for more than 30% of unit sales, the company said in March.  \u201cWe don\u2019t see this slowing down at all,\u201d McMullen had told Reuters in a separate interview in May.  Cincinnati-based Kroger has long made store brands that compete with name brands from Kraft Heinz Co, Nestle and others. But it started focusing more on its own brands in 2012 and flagged them as key to reviving sales growth when introducing its \u201cRestock Kroger\u201d plan two years ago.  Graphic on store brand growth: tmsnrt.rs\/31Ff7UN  Kroger\u2019s Simple Truth line hit $2.3 billion in annual sales to become the biggest U.S. natural and organic brand, the grocer said in March. Sales of its Kroger range and premium Private Selection food line are also growing, with the total own brand portfolio expanding 45% since 2011.  Starbucks Corp kicked off the unicorn food craze in 2017, sparking a social media frenzy with its pink and blue Unicorn Frappuccino. Breakfast cereal and cake followed, and Target Corp launched a cherry-flavored Unicorn Magic ice cream last year.  Kroger debuted its cake batter-flavored Unicorn Swirl in March, and saw more than 2.5 million likes and shares on social media for the product on National Unicorn Day on April 9.  \u201cKroger has been very clever about expanding into rapidly growing categories,\u201d said Neil Saunders, who heads retail consultancy GlobalData, highlighting brands like Simple Truth and Home Chef meal kits.  Simple Truth has likewise benefited from a social media boost. Kayla Schneider, 28, a vegan receptionist and beauty advisor from Fenton, Michigan, has 11,000 Twitter followers and earlier this year tweeted when Simple Truth vegan ice cream went on sale.  \u201cI have a lot of followers who also share my type of diet and I like sharing new finds\/yummy products so they can try them out as well,\u201d Schneider said in a Twitter direct message.  Almost half of Kroger\u2019s private-label grocery lines, including bakery and dairy items, are produced in its 37 plants, giving it an advantage when it comes to creating and testing out items.  Kroger makes more in-house than other U.S. retailers, with Walmart outsourcing all store-brand production until very recently, when it opened a dairy in Indiana, retail consultant Roger Davidson said.  \u201cThey (Kroger) are very serious about private label and in my opinion better than any consumer goods company in the U.S.,\u201d said Davidson, who used to oversee food procurement at Walmart. \u201cBig CPG companies are really struggling,\u201d he said, referring to consumer packaged goods makers.  Kroger has been looking for ways to claw back market share from Walmart, the world\u2019s biggest retailer, and German discount chain Aldi. It also has to grapple with Amazon\u2019s fast-growing private-label sales, both online and in Whole Foods.  MARGIN PRESSURES  Soaring commodities and freight costs have pressured margins at companies like Procter & Gamble Co and Unilever PLC in recent years, making it harder for them to compete.  Meanwhile, Kroger\u2019s private-label margin is typically 600 to 800 basis points higher than that of big consumer brands, McMullen said on Thursday.  Private-label products on average are about 20% less expensive than branded goods, according to data from market research firm IRI.  At a Kroger-owned Mariano\u2019s in Chicago, 24 bottles of own-brand water cost $2.50 versus $4.99 for Nestle\u2019s Pure Life, for instance. The world\u2019s No.1 consumer company said in April there was no point in Pure Life trying to outcompete private-label bottled water.  Own-brand products made up 14.9% of U.S. store sales in 2018, up half a percentage point, with frozen, pet and baby products growing fastest and millennials buying most, according to IRI.  That compares with an international average of 39.4%. The share is highest in Britain at 52.5%, in part due to discounters like Aldi.  Aldi is expanding rapidly in the United States and seeks to become the No.3 U.S. grocery chain with 2,500 stores by 2022. It sells products that are almost entirely house brand.  KETO, PALEO, FLEXITARIAN  Kroger has a 400-person team developing its brands. The company poached Gil Phipps in 2012 from Texas-based retailer H-E-B, which has sought to emulate British store brand leaders like Sainsbury\u2019s since the 1990s.  But Walmart has also been adding private labels, while already squeezing Kroger on price and outperforming on e-commerce and automation.  In March, Walmart launched its Hello Bello line of plant-based baby products with actor couple Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard. A month later, it introduced Unicorn Sparkle ice cream selling for $2.24 for 48 ounces, compared to $2.50 for Kroger\u2019s Unicorn Swirl.  As part of the \u201cRestock Kroger\u201d drive, the company is also investing in store revamps and delivery, although a joint venture with British online grocer Ocado is taking time to ramp up.  \u201cI worry whether Kroger is really keeping the end consumer in mind. They have so many irons in the fire,\u201d said consultant Davidson.","51":"CINCINNATI (Reuters) - Kroger Co KR.N, the nation's biggest supermarket chain, whose founder delivered groceries by horse and buggy, is using a different kind of horsepower in its race with online grocery sellers.

Its shares, up 13% this year, fell 5%.  \u201cInvestors might be slightly jittery from Kroger not quantifying its FY20 outlook,\u201d CFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram said.  Digital sales skyrocketed 92% in the first quarter ended May 23, compared with the previous quarter\u2019s 22% increase, as more consumers opted for Kroger\u2019s delivery and pickup services. Overall same-store sales, excluding the impact of fuel prices, rose 19%.  Kroger said same-store sales growth was trending in the mid-teens range so far this quarter, as customers cook more at home.  \u201cCustomers are still stocking up, but to a lesser degree than during the shutdowns ... We do expect sales to continue to taper as the quarter progresses,\u201d said Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip.  The results showed sales rose 11.5% to $41.55 billion, versus an average estimate of $40.72 billion.

Shares in Kroger, the largest U.S. supermarket operator with $123 billion in 2017 sales, closed up 2.35 percent at $30.45 on news of the deal.  Kroger's arrangement with Alibaba raises the stakes for rival U.S. grocery seller Walmart Inc WMT.N, which along with its Chinese partner JD.com Inc JD.O, is already fighting Alibaba for dominance in the world's second biggest economy.  \u201cE-commerce enables Kroger to quickly scale (up) to reach new customers and markets where we don\u2019t operate physical stores, starting with China,\u201d Yael Cosset, Kroger\u2019s chief digital officer, said in a statement.  The latest move from the 135-year-old grocer comes as the $800 billion U.S. grocery industry wrestles Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O aggressive expansion into groceries through its purchase of specialty retailer Whole Foods Market and other efforts.  Kroger responded with its biggest strategy shift in two decades and already has unveiled a series of online initiatives.  Those include inking an exclusive U.S. deal with British online grocer Ocado OCDO.L to build automated warehouses to prepare curbside pickup and delivery orders, and launching a beefed-up U.S. online shopping service called Kroger Ship that sends packages directly from its distribution centers.  Kroger said its Simple Truth natural and organic products, which generated $2 billion in sales last year, will be sold in China beginning on Wednesday. Initial offerings include almonds and multivitamins.  Walmart and JD have been tightening their alliance to counter Alibaba\u2019s dominance in China\u2019s grocery sector, where the share of online business is expected to more than double to 6.6 percent by 2020, according to research firm IGD.  JD.com, the second-largest e-commerce retailer in China, serves as an online shopping platform for many Walmart stores in the country. The U.S. retailer holds a 12 percent stake in the Chinese company.  Earlier this year, Walmart opened a small high-tech supermarket and partnered with JD to deliver groceries from the store, in a bid to compete with delivery from Alibaba\u2019s Hema Fresh stores.  Walmart and JD also co-invested $500 million in a Chinese online grocery and delivery firm to check Alibaba, which is rapidly expanding its retail network, investing in brick-and-mortar stores and cutting deals to combine shoppers\u2019 online and offline experience.","55":"Sept 11 (Reuters) - Kroger Co reported a 14.6% rise in quarterly same-store sales on Friday, helped by a surge in online grocery sales as customers cooked more at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, sending the U.S. supermarket chain\u2019s shares up 4%.

The company has made heavy investments to engineer a turnaround and gain market share from rivals including Walmart Inc WMT.N and Albertsons.

The announcement follows similar moves by Walmart Inc and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Inc on Wednesday, two weeks after social media-savvy students ignited an intense debate on gun control in the United States following a deadly shooting spree at their Florida high school.  \u201cRecent events demonstrate the need for additional action on the part of responsible gun retailers,\u201d Kroger said in an email.  Kroger operates 133 Fred Meyer stores in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington. It sells firearms in 43 of those stores.  The company will also stop selling assault-style rifles in Alaska. It ceased such sales in its Fred Meyer stores in Oregon, Washington and Idaho several years ago.  \u201cWe made the decision (Wednesday) that we will no longer sell assault-style rifles in Alaska nor accept any special orders of these weapons in this market,\u201d a Kroger spokeswoman said.  Fourteen students and three adults were killed in Florida on Feb. 14 after being shot with a semi-automatic AR-15-style assault rifle. Authorities have said the weapon was purchased legally last year by the accused gunman, Nikolas Cruz, when he was 18 years old.  Federal firearms law allows people aged 18 and older to buy \u201clong guns,\u201d including shotguns and rifles, and associated ammunition from licensed firearm dealers. The law restricts dealer sales of other guns, including handguns like pistols, and related ammunition to people who are 21 and older.  The National Rifle Association, which represents gunmakers and gun owners, opposes raising the minimum age for purchases of rifles or \u201clong guns.\u201d  Gun control supporters have other retailers in their sights.

Representatives from Academy Sports did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  New online petitions also target Bass Pro Shops and Cabela\u2019s, which together operate roughly 200 stores. Bass Pro, which bought Cabela\u2019s in September, did not immediately comment.  Walmart stopped selling assault firearms and accessories in 2015 and only sells handguns in Alaska.

Using face masks is the top recommendation from health experts and government officials looking to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in 136,000 deaths across the country.  Walmart said about 65% of its over 5,000 U.S. stores, including its wholesale Sam\u2019s Club outlets, were in areas where there was already some form of government mandate on face coverings. Its new policy will now apply to all stores from Monday.  Kroger will require the use of face masks in all its locations from July 22, while department store chain Kohls, whose majority store base already insists on face coverings, will make it a requirement across stores starting July 20.  Best Buy Co Inc and Starbucks Corp have already imposed the use of face masks at their U.S. outlets.  Trade group National Retail Federation (NRF) on Wednesday pushed for retailers to adopt a nationwide policy that requires customers to wear masks.  While many retailers have recommended masks for months, they were hesitant to make it a requirement, for fear of antagonizing shoppers, with numerous videos posted online on confrontations between customers and employees.  \u201cShopping in a store is a privilege, not a right.

The U.S. grocery industry is dominated by Walmart Inc WMT.N and Kroger but has been in upheaval since last summer, when Amazon's $13.7 billion deal for Whole Foods sent supermarkets scrambling to match the online retailer on home delivery.  The Kroger deal announced on Thursday is Ocado\u2019s first in the United States and the British company\u2019s fourth major agreement with retailers in six months.  Shares of Ocado, an online grocery retailer known for using robots rather than people to process and pack orders, soared as much as 80 percent to an all-time high. Kroger shares were last up 1.4 percent, with investors reassured by the U.S. company\u2019s saying the move would not dampen expected earnings for 2018 and 2019.  Kroger Chief Executive Officer Rodney McMullen called the partnership \u201ctransformative\u201d and told Reuters that it accelerates the company\u2019s efforts to give customers anything, anytime, anywhere.  While Cincinnati, Ohio-based Kroger currently offers online grocery delivery service, orders are filled at individual stores and delivery is handled in-house by Kroger and by third-party providers Instacart and Target Corp-owned Shipt TGT.N.  Kroger\u2019s deal with Ocado, which is exclusive, won plaudits on Wall Street.  \u201cThe Ocado partnership is the best investment the Kroger Company\u2019s ever made in the last 25 years,\u201d said Burt Flickinger, managing director of consultancy Strategic Resource Group.  \u201cOcado is a consumer\u2019s dream and a competitor\u2019s nightmare, and the competitor that\u2019s going to get caught in the crossfire is clearly Amazon,\u201d he said.  U.S. supermarkets fear Amazon will apply its distribution know-how to Whole Foods by transforming existing stores into a grocery delivery network with help from low-cost \u201cgig economy\u201d drivers. Amazon is already offering free two-hour delivery from some U.S. stores for members of its loyalty club Prime.

E-commerce accounts for 7.5 percent of sales of packaged consumer goods in Britain, compared with 1.5 percent in the United States, according to data firm Kantar World Panel, which predicts the latter will rise to 8 percent by 2025.  Some analysts and grocers question how well the Ocado model is suited to the U.S. market given its much more dispersed population compared with densely populated Britain.  Outside urban areas, they say that it makes more sense to focus on having people pick groceries from existing stores rather than building expensive high-tech warehouses, or to offer curbside pickup for orders, a service available at Walmart and Kroger.  Kroger executives said the deal is beneficial even if significant U.S. delivery demand fails to materialize.  That\u2019s because Ocado\u2019s warehouses, known as \u201csheds,\u201d could assemble orders for Kroger\u2019s popular ClickList curbside service, lowering costs and freeing employees to better serve customers, who now tend to bounce between in-store shopping, pickup and delivery.  \u201cThis will leapfrog our ability to do that in an accelerated way and in a cost-effective way,\u201d CEO McMullen told Reuters.  Both Amazon and Whole Foods declined comment on the deal.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  TRANSFORMING THE INDUSTRY  The deal is a setback for Ahold Delhaize AD.AS, owner of U.S. chains Food Lion, Stop & Shop and Giant, which some analysts had considered a candidate to merge with Kroger to give the retailer access to Ahold's U.S. online grocery delivery service Peapod.  Shares in Ahold fell 1.8 percent.  Kroger, which already holds a 1 percent stake in Ocado, will buy new shares equivalent to 5 percent valued at 183 million pounds ($247.5 million), Ocado said.  Shares in Ocado, which listed in 2010 and delivered its first annual profit in 2014, hit a record of 1,000 pence before closing up 44.4 percent at 804 pence.  Kroger will identify at least 20 sites to build automated warehouses in the United States, Chief Financial Officer Duncan Tatton-Brown said, exceeding all of the centers Ocado has built or is planning to build for all other partnerships.  The two companies are working to identify the first three sites in 2018. McMullen said the first would likely be in an area where Kroger has stores and an opportunity reach new customers.  Ocado \u201csheds\u201d typically take around two years to open, said McMullen who added that services would be offered under the Kroger name or those of its supermarket chains, such as Ralphs in Southern California.  Tatton-Brown said the partnership has scope in the future to grow two or three times beyond the initial 20 centers.  Kroger has roughly 2,800 stores in 34 mainly Midwest and southern states and offers delivery from 1,100 stores and ClickList pickup at more than 1,000.  The detailed financial terms have yet to be agreed, but Kroger could bring forward some of its payments under the deal, which would reduce Ocado\u2019s need for capital. If the retailer fails to hit volume targets it could also lose exclusivity and will have to pay compensation to Ocado.

But Kroger Co believes products like Kroger Best Unicorn Swirl ice cream will help it win market share from Walmart Inc , Aldi and Amazon.com Inc.  By churning out trendy new house-brand items, Kroger hopes to tap into broad sales growth for private labels. The push comes as grocers compete fiercely on price and race to expand online ordering and delivery, an area where the biggest U.S. grocery chain has lagged.  Kroger added 1,022 \u201cown brand\u201d items in 2018, and each supermarket on average stocks more than 15,000 private-label products such as pet food, clothes, furniture, meal kits and office supplies. Kroger\u2019s 16 house brands now account for more than 30% of unit sales, the company said in March.  \u201cWe don\u2019t see this slowing down at all,\u201d Kroger Chief Executive Rodney McMullen told Reuters in an interview in May.  Cincinnati-based Kroger has long made store brands that compete with name brands from Kraft Heinz Co, Nestle and others. But it started focusing more on its own brands in 2012 and flagged them as key to reviving sales growth when introducing its \u201cRestock Kroger\u201d plan two years ago.  Graphic on store brand growth: tmsnrt.rs\/31Ff7UN  Kroger\u2019s Simple Truth line hit $2.3 billion in annual sales to become the biggest U.S. natural and organic brand, the grocer said in March. Sales of its Kroger range and premium Private Selection food line are also growing, with the total own brand portfolio expanding 45% since 2011.  Kroger has been using data to spot trends and jump on them quickly, McMullen told Reuters, and unicorn ice cream is one example.  Starbucks Corp kicked off the unicorn food craze in 2017, sparking a social media frenzy with its pink and blue Unicorn Frappuccino. Breakfast cereal and cake followed, and Target Corp launched a cherry-flavored Unicorn Magic ice cream last year.  Kroger debuted its cake batter-flavored Unicorn Swirl in March, and saw more than 2.5 million likes and shares on social media for the product on National Unicorn Day on April 9. It declined to comment on sales, beyond saying they had far exceeded the company\u2019s expectations.  \u201cKroger has been very clever about expanding into rapidly growing categories,\u201d said Neil Saunders, who heads retail consultancy GlobalData, highlighting brands like Simple Truth and Home Chef meal kits.  Simple Truth has likewise benefited from a social media boost. Kayla Schneider, 28, a vegan receptionist and beauty advisor from Fenton, Michigan, has 11,000 Twitter followers and earlier this year tweeted when Simple Truth vegan ice cream went on sale.  \u201cI have a lot of followers who also share my type of diet and I like sharing new finds\/yummy products so they can try them out as well,\u201d Schneider said in a Twitter direct message.  Almost half of Kroger\u2019s private-label grocery lines, including bakery and dairy items, are produced in its 37 plants, giving it an advantage over rivals when it comes to quickly creating and testing out items.  Kroger makes more in-house than other U.S. retailers, with Walmart outsourcing all store-brand production until very recently, when it opened a dairy in Indiana, retail consultant Roger Davidson said.  \u201cThey (Kroger) are very serious about private label and in my opinion better than any consumer goods company in the U.S.,\u201d said Davidson, who used to oversee food procurement at Walmart. \u201cBig CPG companies are really struggling,\u201d he said, referring to consumer packaged goods makers.  Kroger reports quarterly earnings on Thursday. It has been looking for ways to claw back market share from Walmart, the world\u2019s biggest retailer, and German discount chain Aldi. It also has to grapple with Amazon\u2019s fast-growing private-label sales, both online and in Whole Foods.  Aldi shares tanked in March when it reported a 10% fall in fourth-quarter revenue and lower-than-expected earnings for the first time since October 2017.  FAMILIES CAN SAVE $3,000 A YEAR  Soaring commodities and freight costs have pressured margins at companies like Procter & Gamble Co and Unilever PLC in recent years, making it harder for them to compete.  Private-label products on average are about 20% less expensive than branded goods, according to data from market research firm IRI.  Nestle said in April there was no point in its Pure Life brand trying to outcompete private-label bottled water. The world\u2019s No. 1 consumer company is expanding its premium, fizzy and flavored waters to eventually outweigh some lost volumes.  At a Kroger-owned Mariano\u2019s in Chicago, 24 bottles of own-brand water cost $2.50 versus $4.99 for Pure Life.  A U.S. family of five can save up to $3,000 a year buying private-label food, and get equal or higher nutritional value, according to Burt Flickinger, managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group.  U.S. private-label packaged food sales were $65.42 billion last year, up 7% from 2013, according to Euromonitor.  Own-brand products made up 14.9% of U.S. store sales in 2018, up half a percentage point, with frozen, pet and baby products growing fastest and millennials buying most, according to IRI.  That compares with an international average of 39.4%. The share is highest in Britain at 52.5%, in part due to discounters like Aldi.  Aldi is expanding rapidly in the United States and seeks to become the No.3 U.S. grocery chain with 2,500 stores by 2022. It sells products that are almost entirely house brand, including weekly deals on clothes, toys and homewares.  Last fall, Kroger rolled out an in-house fashion label called Dip, sold in 305 of its 2,800 stores. It added Dip homewares and furniture in 525 stores earlier this year.  But analysts say Dip, with clothes that are $19 or less, has been underwhelming.  \u201cAny grocer that goes into non-food often doesn\u2019t do very well,\u201d GlobalData\u2019s Saunders said.  A Kroger spokeswoman said customer response to both Dip apparel and home goods had been favorable.  KETO, PALEO, FLEXITARIAN  Kroger has a 400-person team developing its brands. The company poached Gil Phipps in 2012 from Texas-based retailer H-E-B, which has sought to emulate British store brand leaders like Sainsbury\u2019s since the 1990s.  Phipps said Kroger\u2019s consumer trend data will dictate where it expands next: \u201cWe will continue to introduce more plant-based foods and products that fit various eating styles like keto, paleo and flexitarian.\u201d  But Walmart has also been adding private labels, while already squeezing Kroger on price and outperforming on e-commerce and automation.  In March, Walmart launched its Hello Bello line of plant-based baby products with actor couple Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard. A month later, it introduced Unicorn Sparkle ice cream selling for $2.24 for 48 ounces, compared to $2.50 for Kroger\u2019s Unicorn Swirl.  \u201cI want to offer the best quality products for the best price, and we have been concentrating on that and I\u2019m thrilled with the progress we have made,\u201d Walmart\u2019s U.S. CEO Greg Foran told shareholders earlier this month.  As part of the \u201cRestock Kroger\u201d drive, the company is also investing in store revamps and delivery, although a joint venture with British online grocer Ocado is taking time to ramp up.  \u201cI worry whether Kroger is really keeping the end consumer in mind. They have so many irons in the fire,\u201d said consultant Davidson.","100":"FILE PHOTO: The Kroger supermarket chain's headquarters is shown in Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S., June 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Lisa Baertlein\/File Photo  (Reuters) - U.S. supermarket chain Kroger Co said on Wednesday it had blocked Indiana Oath Keepers, a far-right militia group, from receiving donations collected from customers after drawing flak from a number of social media users.  Investigators of the U.S. Capitol breach on Jan. 6 accused members of Oath Keepers of organizing the riot that left five people dead. Criminal complaints have revealed that many of the suspects have ties to the group and the Proud Boys, another right-wing group.  \u201cGiven the concerning nature of the allegations against this organization, we have immediately removed the group from receiving customer-directed funds,\u201d Kroger said in a statement.  It said Oath Keepers was an IRS-approved non-profit organization and was receiving donations through its customer-directed program in which thousands of groups participate.  \u201cWe were dismayed to learn yesterday (Tuesday) that this group was part of the Community Rewards program,\u201d Kroger said.  The company said it had not directed any corporate grants or charitable dollars to the organization that received \u201cnominal amount\u201d of the customer-directed funds.  Kroger is currently reviewing the list of organizations enrolled in the program to determine if there are additional groups that should be removed, it said.","101":"April 16 (Reuters) - Kroger Co:  * KROGER CO - CO, ITS SUBSIDIARIES WILL NOW OFFER ASSOCIATES AN EMPLOYEE EDUCATION BENEFIT OF UP TO $3,500 ANNUALLY  * KROGER CO ANNOUNCES \u201cLONG-TERM ASSOCIATE BENEFITS FOLLOWING TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT\u201d Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","102":"FILE PHOTO: A logo of Kroger is displayed on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., December 5, 2017.

REUTERS\/Lisa Baertlein\/File Photo  Shares of the Cincinnati-based company fell more than 2% in early trading after sales at established stores rose just 1.5%, excluding fuel, below a consensus estimate of 1.78%, according to Refinitiv IBES data.  Analysts said the soft numbers showed the company was struggling to attract shoppers despite slashing prices to keep up in a crowded U.S. grocery market.  \u201cWith the U.S. economy doing really well, particularly with the middle-income consumer, which is Kroger\u2019s consumer ... the very tepid same-store sales growth has got people pretty nervous,\u201d Scott Mushkin, an analyst with Wolfe Research said.  Under its \u201cRestock Kroger\u201d program, the company has been highlighting private label brand display, rearranging store layouts and expanding services such as home delivery and self checkouts.  It has also invested in expanding its online business and improving its Kroger app. The initiatives powered a 42% jump in digital sales in the first-quarter ended May 25.  Gross margin, however, fell 40 basis points to 22.22%, hurt by its low-margin pharmacy business.  \u201cThe challenge is, the benefits of the \u2018Restock Kroger\u2019 program appear to be outweighed by the challenges the company is seeing (in) the competitive environment,\u201d Mushkin said.  Walmart last month reported its best first quarter same-store sales growth in nearly a decade.  Kroger maintained its profit and same-store sales forecast for the year even as it topped expectations for overall quarterly sales and profit.  Excluding one-time items, the company earned 72 cents per share. Sales overall fell 1.2% to $37.25 billion, reflecting the decision to close its convenience store business.  Analysts had expected a profit of 71 cents per share and sales of $37.21 billion.","104":"Dec 6 (Reuters) - Kroger Co reported quarterly same-store sales that fell short of analysts\u2019 estimates on Thursday, hurt by disruptions caused by revamping the layout of its stores to give more shelf space to its best selling products.  Cincinnati-based Kroger said net income attributable to Kroger fell to $317 million, or 39 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Nov. 10, from $397 million, or 44 cents per share, a year earlier.  The company said same-store sales, excluding fuel, rose 1.6 percent. Analysts on average had expected a 1.65 percent increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Grocers across the United States have been implementing new ways to draw more shoppers to their stores as they face intense competition from online retailer Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and its unit Whole Foods.  Kroger said the pilot program will be tested across 13 Walgreens stores near Kroger\u2019s Cincinnati headquarters.  Kroger said customers will also be able to shop for its \u2018Our Brands\u2019 range, including the Simple Truth organic food brand, at the Walgreens stores.

REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  (Reuters) - Kroger Co's KR.N superstore chain Fred Meyer said it would exit its firearms business, two weeks after deciding to stop selling guns and ammunition to those under the age of 21.  Earlier this month, Kroger joined other U.S. retailers such as Walmart Inc WMT.N and Dick's Sporting Goods Inc DKS.N to bar the sale of firearms to those under 21, following a deadly shooting at a Florida high school.  Fred Meyer said it was working on plans to phase out sales of firearms and ammunition.  \u201cThis is a victory for communities and for common sense. And it\u2019s a positive step for our pension fund beneficiaries and for public safety,\u201d New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who oversees the city\u2019s public pension funds, said in a statement. Stringer said he had called for Kroger to cease selling firearms last year.  Several large money management firms that own shares in gun makers, including BlackRock Inc BLK.N, the world's largest asset manager, and State Street Corp STT.N, have felt the heat following the Florida massacre and have sought answers from gun makers and distributors.  Fred Meyer said the firearm business generated about $7 million annually, while it also highlighted \u201csoftening consumer demand.\u201d  Fred Meyer operates 133 stores in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington and sells firearms in 43 of them.","107":"(Reuters) - Kroger Co raised its annual profit forecast on Thursday, although the U.S. supermarket chain missed expectations for quarterly sales as its coronavirus-driven online growth slowed due to an easing in restrictions in the second half of the year.

However, a spike in coronavirus cases has led to a pick up in sales in recent weeks, prompting the retailer to reimpose a purchase limit on certain essential products.  \u201cBears rightly point out that recent growth rates are unsustainable,\u201d Evercore analyst Michael Montani said.  Kroger expects adjusted per-share profit of $3.30 to $3.35 in 2020, compared with its prior range of $3.20 to $3.30 and Refinitiv IBES estimate of $3.30.  It also expects same-store sales, excluding fuel, to rise around 14%, compared with its prior view of a more than 13% growth and estimate of a 13.08% rise.  Third-quarter same-store sales, excluding fuel, rose 10.9%, beating estimates. Sales including fuel, however, rose 6.3% to $29.72 billion, missing $29.97 billion estimate.
