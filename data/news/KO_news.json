In a presentation outlining its long-term plans to investors, Whitbread also predicted that its German operations would be profitable in fiscal year 2022.  The group, which completed the $5 billion sale of Costa Coffee last month, has shifted focus completely to its hotels business. It also forecast a further 220 million pounds in savings over the next three years.","1":"(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co KO.N reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and sales on Friday as it sold more teas, coffees and vitamin water, offsetting sluggish sales of fizzy drinks, sending its shares up as much as 2 percent.  Coke also said it planned to use cash it held overseas and savings generated from the U.S. corporate tax rate changes to reduce its debt by $7 billion, making it the latest company to take advantage of the new tax law to bolster its balance sheet.  For the fourth quarter, however, the company took a $3.6 billion charge related to the tax law, resulting in a net loss compared with a profit a year earlier.  Coke and rival PepsiCo PEP.O have been struggling with lower sales of their sugary sodas as consumers shift to healthier drinks. Earlier this week, Pepsi also reported weak quarterly sales of sodas and sugary drinks.  To stem the decline, Coke relaunched its iconic low-calorie Diet Coke in four new flavors - ginger-lime, feisty cherry, blood orange and twisted mango - earlier this year, and has focused on its non-fizzy beverages such as Georgia coffee and Glaceau vitamin water.  Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said the new flavors and packaging were a step in the right direction and that sales of Coke Zero Sugar were picking up following a relaunch.  Net operating revenue fell to $7.51 billion from $9.41 billion a year earlier due to ongoing efforts to refranchise its bottling operations, but beat the average analyst estimate of $7.36 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Global volume growth remained unchanged even as North America volumes increased 1 percent.  Wells Fargo analyst Bonnnie Herzog said flat unit case volume growth was a concern but positive momentum in many international markets was encouraging.  The Fanta and Diet Coke maker reported a net loss of $2.75 billion, or 65 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, mainly due to a $3.6 billion charge related to the new tax law. A year earlier the company had posted a profit of $550 million, or 13 cents per share.  On an adjusted basis, the company reported earnings per share of 39 cents, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of 38 cents.  For 2018, the Coke said it expects organic revenue to grow 4 percent and adjusted earnings per share to grow between 8 and 10 percent.","2":"Aug 28 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co said on Friday it would reduce its global workforce as part of a company-wide restructuring.  The beverage maker did not provide details on how many jobs it plans to cut, but said it would offer voluntary separation packages to 4,000 employees in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico.  The company said it would incur about $350 million to $550 million in severance expenses.","3":"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Beverages South Africa (CCBSA) will increase the stake held by employees and black empowerment investors in the company to 20%, it said on Friday, in a bid to meet merger conditions laid out by competition authorities.  Bottles of Coca-Cola are displayed at a supermarket. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  In 2014, the Coca-Cola Company and SABMiller Plc reached an agreement with the majority shareholder of a company which bottled Coca-Cola\u2019s products to combine the bottling operations of their non-alcoholic beverages businesses in Southern and East Africa, which led to the creation of CCBSA\u2019s parent company.  The parent company is Coca-Cola Beverages Africa.  The merger required the parties to increase black empowerment ownership of CCBSA, a government rule meant to reverse decades of economic exclusion of black people under apartheid.  Companies in South Africa are required to meet rules of a scheme called Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) which allows black employees and investors to hold equity in the company. This makes a company more likely to qualify for government tenders.  The deal will see nearly 8,000 employees increase their current holding of around 5% in CCBSA to an approximate 15% shareholding, CCBSA Managing Director, Velaphi Ratshefola and Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition Ebrahim Patel said in a joint statement.  Adding to the company\u2019s external BEE partners, the combined equity stake will be 20%, Patel said.  In June the company said every employee will receive an equal allocation of shares regardless of staff level, race or years of service.  CCBSA, a bottler for the Coca-Cola Company, will also be contributing 80 million rand ($5.39 million) per year for three years to the government\u2019s localisation initiatives.  \u201cWe have also undertaken to collaborate with our sugar suppliers to increase the volume of sugarcane procured from black farmers,\u201d Ratshefola added.

The somber forecast undid an initial rise in shares of the world\u2019s biggest drinks maker after it topped forecasts for revenue and profit, helped by a reboot of its Diet Coke brand that has introduced new flavors and cans.  The company said it had reformulated recipes and launched smaller packaging to ensure that two-thirds of its major brands would not be subject to the new tax, but Coca-Cola Classic, its top-selling U.K. brand, will still face the levy, which kicked in on April 6.  Company executives during a post-earnings call also cautioned that rising freight costs in North America, up 20 percent from a year earlier, would reduce revenue in the first half of the year.  \u201cPeople assumed that Coke sold to bottlers, and so some didn\u2019t realize how much exposure the company has on freight,\u201d said Brittany Weissman, a consumer analyst with Edward Jones. \u201cBut they do distribute and are affected.\u201d  U.S. packaged goods companies, already struggling with lower demand and price tensions with retailers, have recently begun flagging higher commodities and transportation costs.  A jump in volumes due to the timing of Easter holiday shipments and price cuts in North America helped Coca-Cola top first-quarter revenue estimate by $300 million.  Total volumes rose 3 percent in the first quarter, with growth in both sodas and teas and coffees driving much of the gains.  Organic sales, which exclude gains from acquisitions or divestitures, rose 5 percent in the quarter.  \u201cWhile it\u2019s good to see the underlying volumes improve, people are concerned on the pricing side, if those volumes are gaining at the expense of the price and mix,\u201d said Weissman.  First quarter net revenue fell 16 percent to $7.63 billion, due to the divestment of its bottling operations, but beat analysts\u2019 estimates of $7.34 billion.  Despite the strong results, Coca-Cola retained its full-year outlook for organic sales growth and earnings per share, which could also have disappointed investors, brokerage Macquarie said.  Excluding items, net profit of 47 cents per share beat consensus forecasts by 1 cent, the company said.","5":"(Corrects to show Coke distribution is for Kaiser not former Kirin products)  BRUSSELS, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Heineken, the world\u2019s second largest brewer, denied on Sunday a Brazilian newspaper report, which said that Coca-Cola Brasil had filed a lawsuit seeking to annul Heineken\u2019s 2017 acquisition of Brasil Kirin.  The Valor Economico newspaper said that the filing in a Brazilian court accused the Dutch brewer of designing a sale contract for Brasil Kirin with the intention of breaking the distribution contract it had with Coca Cola.  However, Heineken said it understood the lawsuit from Coca-Cola Brasil and Brazilian Coke bottlers was not threatening the acquisition, which made it the number two player in the country, the world\u2019s third-largest beer market.  Last October, an arbitration tribunal decided Heineken must keep distributing its existing Kaiser products via the Coca-Cola network until March 2022, keeping the dates in the original contract. Heineken had wanted to sell its new and existing brands via its own distribution system.  Heineken said on Sunday it had become aware of the lawsuit through public sources, but believed the suit was not aimed at annulling its 2017 acquisition of Kirin\u2019s business in Brazil.  Coca-Cola Brasil and the Brazilian Coke bottlers, it said were seeking compensation, for Heineken\u2019s unwillingness to transfer its portfolio of beers bought with the Kirin acquisition to the Coke distribution system.  The plaintiffs were challenging certain corporate actions of Heineken, but these actions did not impact the validity of its Brasil Kirin purchase. An arbitration tribunal had already addressed these issues, Heineken said.  Heineken also said the lawsuit did not change its operations in Brazil, including distribution of its Kaiser brands via Coke distributors.  Coca-Cola did not immediately comment on the matter.

FILE PHOTO: Dr Pepper soda cans for sale are pictured at a grocery store in Pasadena, California, U.S., February 14, 2018. REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni  The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected California resident Shana Becerra\u2019s claim that Dr Pepper\/Seven Up, now part of Keurig Dr Pepper Inc, misled consumers, including through ads featuring physically attractive models, and that its conduct violated California consumer fraud laws.  Becerra, who claimed to have struggled with obesity since childhood, relied on scientific evidence that she said linked aspartame, an artificial sweetener used in Diet Dr Pepper, to possible weight gain.  But in a 3-0 decision for the San Francisco-based court, Circuit Judge Jay Bybee said Becerra failed to show that reasonable consumers associated diet soda with health benefits.  \u201cNo reasonable consumer would assume that Diet Dr Pepper\u2019s use of the term \u2018diet\u2019 promises weight loss or management,\u201d Bybee wrote. \u201cThe use of \u2018diet\u2019 in a soft drink\u2019s brand name is understood as a relative claim about the calorie content of that soft drink compared to the same brand\u2019s \u2018regular\u2019 (full-caloric) option.\u201d  John Weston, one of Becerra\u2019s lawyers, said he was disappointed with the decision.  Evan Young, a lawyer for Dr Pepper\/Seven Up, in an email said people who drink Diet Dr Pepper know it is a calorie-free version of Dr Pepper.  \u201cWe appreciate that the Ninth Circuit has allowed common sense to prevail and that it rejected the attempt to complicate something that is so simple,\u201d he added.

The 9th Circuit last week dismissed Becerra\u2019s appeal in a similar case against Coca-Cola Co over Diet Coke, saying it lacked jurisdiction because the February 2018 dismissal by U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco was not final.  Alsup would be expected to apply the reasoning in Monday\u2019s decision if Becerra pursued the Diet Coke case.

FILE PHOTO: Boxes of Coca-Cola are seen at a grocery store in Los Angeles, California U.S. November 21, 2017. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  The Atlanta-based company said fourth-quarter revenue growth was led by its trademark Coca-Cola, that included products such as caffeinated beverage Plus Coffee and Zero Sugar soda.  Retail sales of its flagship brand rose 6%, Chief Executive Officer James Quincey said, adding that volumes in the brand were positive for the second straight year.  The world\u2019s largest beverage maker has been pushing into flavored sodas, coffees, teas and low-sugar beverages to attract consumers who move away from sugary drinks.  The company is also expanding its portfolio and bought dairy company Fairlife earlier this month after spending about $5 billion to buy Costa Coffee last year.  Credit Suisse analyst Kaumil Gajrawala found it reassuring that the group\u2019s core product did well amid such expansion.  \u201cWhen the trademark Coke brand is up 6%... That\u2019s one of the most positive indicators we have,\u201d Gajrawala said.  The group said innovative sodas helped its organic revenue, a keenly watched metric that excludes currency fluctuations and acquisitions, climb 7% during the quarter.  Coca-Cola projected 2020 organic revenue growth to slow slightly to about 5% from a 6% rise it reported in 2019 and said it would continue focus on new categories through acquisitions.  \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty good indication that they feel good about the year so far... this would be seen as setting up a strong year,\u201d industry expert and executive editor of Beverage-Digest, Duane Stanford, said.  Volumes, a key indicator of demand, grew 3%, spurred by its Coca-Cola soda, with growth across all geographies. Volumes grew 4% for teas and coffee and 3% for sparkling soft drinks.  For the year, Coca-Cola expects to record adjusted profit of $2.25 per share, just a cent below analysts\u2019 forecast, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Excluding one-time items, Coca-Cola earned 44 cents per share in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, meeting Wall Street expectations.  Net revenue grew 16% to $9.07 billion, beating analysts\u2019 estimate of $8.89 billion.  Net income attributable to the company\u2019s shareholders rose to $2.04 billion, or 47 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $870 million, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier.","23":"Nov 8 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co said on Thursday it plans to launch two energy drinks under its namesake brand, its latest move to diversify away from sugary sodas.

Coca-Cola announced its interest in a statement on Monday, responding to a report from BNN Bloomberg that said it was in talks with Canada's Aurora Cannabis Inc ACB.TO to develop drinks infused with cannabidiol (CBD), the non-psychoactive chemical found in marijuana.  Coke would join a rush by major alcohol makers and a cigarette company to test the cannabis market and find partners ahead of the Oct. 17 launch of legal recreational marijuana in Canada.  Coke and Aurora, in separate statements, each said they were interested in cannabidiol-infused beverages but would not comment on any specifics or talks. Aurora\u2019s stock soared 17 percent, while Coke\u2019s edged up slightly.  The CBD drinks would likely aim to ease inflammation, pain and cramping, the BNN report said here.  Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog called the news \u201can exciting potential development\u201d as it would take Coke into another fast-growing healthier segment following last month\u2019s $5.1 billion deal for Costa Coffee and expand cannabis-infused drinks in the area of functional wellness products.  The CBD products likely would be different from those produced by alcohol makers, which would likely give drinkers a buzz from tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive chemical in marijuana.  Beer makers Constellation Brands STZ.N, Molson Coors TAP.N and Heineken HEIN.AS are all playing in the market for cannabis products. For example, Heineken's craft beer Lagunitas recently launched Hi-Fi Hops, a beer-flavored sparkling water with THC and CBD.  \u201cThe THC beverages probably sit better with the beer makers, and maybe CBD fits better with Coke, in terms of playing off the health trend,\u201d said Liberum analyst Nico von Stackelberg.

She said she would not be surprised to hear of a similar deal by PepsiCo for its Gatorade drink. Pepsi did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the cannabis market.  Besides Aurora, she said cannabis companies Tilray TLRY.O and Aphria APH.TO were likely targets for partnerships with big consumer companies looking to get into the market.  LEGAL HIGH  Canada is the first major economy to legalize recreational marijuana, and shares in cannabis producers have rallied in anticipation. New Cannabis Ventures' global cannabis stock index has risen about 87 percent over the past year. here  Several U.S. states have legalized marijuana but it remains against federal law.  Sales in U.S. legal markets should nearly triple to $16 billion by 2020 from $5.4 billion in 2015, according to market research firm Euromonitor International, and Constellation says cannabis globally could be worth $200 billion in 15 years.  \u201cAlong with many others in the beverage industry, we are closely watching the growth of non-psychoactive CBD as an ingredient in functional wellness beverages around the world,\u201d Coke said in its statement on Monday.  Cannabidiol is one of hundreds of molecules found in marijuana plants, and contains less than 0.1 percent of THC. It does not cause intoxication.  There are already CBD drinks available in some markets, made by brands such as Dirty Lemon, Sprig and Kickback.  Moving into this area carries little reputational risk for Coke, said Liberum\u2019s von Stackelberg.  \u201cIf they came out with a THC-infused drink, that\u2019s a different question,\u201d he said.

The world's biggest beverage makers, Coca-Cola and rival PepsiCo PEP.O, have been responding to changing consumer tastes by moving beyond traditional sodas and offering drinks that are lower in sugar or come in new flavors and in ready-to go packages.  \u201cOur performance was largely driven by consumer demand for no sugar versions of some of our best-known sparkling soft drink brands as well as for the a smaller packages for less sugar,\u201d Chief Executive Officer James Quincey told analysts.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected California resident Shana Becerra\u2019s claim that Dr Pepper\/Seven Up, now part of Keurig Dr Pepper Inc, misled consumers, including through ads featuring physically attractive models, and that its conduct violated California consumer fraud laws.

Then in September 2015 a letter from the IRS arrived at Coca-Cola\u2019s Atlanta headquarters with a bill for back taxes whose amount, $3.3 billion, stunned the world\u2019s No. 1 soft drinks maker.  Coca-Cola sued the IRS, disputing the bill. The case is being tried now in U.S. Tax Court in Washington. A verdict is not expected for some time after the trial ends, expected in mid-April.  The case is being watched closely by tax experts as a sign of rising tension between tax authorities and multinational corporations over transfer pricing, that is, the way companies value the goods, services, trademark and patent rights that they constantly move among foreign units across national boundaries.  An important management discipline inside multinationals, transfer pricing is under more scrutiny than ever before from tax agencies worldwide because of strict new global standards, raising legal risks for companies and their investors.  The Coca-Cola case goes to trial as interest among corporations in seeking multi-year deals with the IRS covering transfer pricing arrangements has fallen in the past two years.  The IRS reported on Friday that it received 101 applications in 2017 for \u201cadvance pricing agreements\u201d (APAs), similar to 2016\u2019s level of 98 in 2016, but well below 2015\u2019s peak of 183.  APA applications also fell in 2016 in Japan, the top U.S. bilateral APA partner, according to the latest data.  Anecdotal evidence suggests the APA process, designed to prevent conflict, is under strain in many countries, with some tax lawyers citing Mexico, Italy and China as challenging.  Corporate tax directors at a conference in Washington earlier this month said APAs are taking longer to negotiate and government tax agencies are less willing to do them.  \u201cWe\u2019re really living in a different time and we can understand why tax authorities might be reluctant because there\u2019s a lot more external scrutiny than there ever was,\u201d said Amy Roberti, director of global tax and fiscal policy for Procter & Gamble Co, at the conference.  Asked for more details afterward, Roberti said through a company spokeswoman that APAs help Procter & Gamble build \u201crelationships with governments and fiscal authorities.\u201d  The IRS did not immediately provide answers to questions about the Coca-Cola case and transfer pricing, in general.  Coca-Cola responded to questions by providing an internal employee memo about the case that said, \u201cThe company firmly believes that the IRS\u2019 claims are without merit and will pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies.\u201d  TRANSFER PRICING CHALLENGE  The IRS contends that Coca-Cola charged several foreign affiliates royalties that were too low from 2007 to 2009, which reduced the parent company\u2019s U.S. income and resulted in underpayment of its U.S. income taxes by $3.3 billion.  Tax agencies often challenge transfer pricing arrangements on the grounds that they are set up to minimize income in high-tax countries and maximize it in low-tax countries.  Under a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting framework set up by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2016, one hundred national tax agencies including the IRS expect companies to use an \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d approach to transfer pricing.  That means, in the case of trademark rights, for instance, charging foreign units royalties equal to their open market value. The trouble is that trademarks are usually unique. So approximating their \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d price is difficult.  Coca-Cola says in court filings that the IRS approved the company\u2019s method for setting its transfer prices for the affiliates in a 1996 agreement, but that the IRS later withdrew that approval and issued the bill for back taxes.  Coca-Cola did not have an APA with the IRS. Instead, it had an APA-like \u201caudit closing agreement\u201d that dated back to 1996 and was, the company says, reaffirmed in later audits.  But much changed in transfer pricing over the more than 20 years since Coca-Cola reached its understanding with the IRS.  \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting case,\u201d said former IRS Acting Commissioner Steven Miller. \u201cIf I were a tax director, I would be thinking about how much I can rely on agreements like this.  \u201cIt does drive home how important it is not to just assume that an agreement can be relied on forever because apparently, maybe not,\u201d said Miller, now national director of tax at consulting firm Alliantgroup.

REUTERS\/Baz Ratner  By a 3-0 vote, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. threw out a May 2016 dismissal of much of Dr Pepper\u2019s decade-old case, saying a trademark review board failed to properly analyze whether \u201czero\u201d was too generic to be trademarked.  Multiple companies sell beverages with the \u201czero\u201d name, which often denotes an absence of calories or carbohydrates.  The ability to market products effectively is important to beverage makers trying to counteract declines in U.S. sales of carbonated soft drinks since their mid-2000s peak.  Coca-Cola and its lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Dr Pepper welcomed the decision. \u201cWe do not believe that any company should have the ability to claim exclusive trademark rights to a term like \u2018zero\u2019 in connection with zero-calorie beverages,\u201d spokesman Chris Barnes said in a statement.  Coca-Cola has used the \u201czero\u201d name on such products as Cherry Coke Zero, Sprite Zero, Powerade Zero, and more recently Coca-Cola Zero Sugar.  The Atlanta-based company\u2019s effort to register U.S. rights to 17 drinks with the word \u201czero\u201d prompted a 2007 challenge by Dr Pepper, whose products include Diet Rite Pure Zero. Coca-Cola argued that such names could confuse consumers.  In 2016, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s Trademark Trial and Appeal Board said \u201czero\u201d had \u201cacquired distinctiveness\u201d when used to sell Coca-Cola soft drinks.  The board cited a 2008 survey offered by Coca-Cola in which 61 percent of consumers associated the word \u201czero\u201d with one company, as opposed to 6 percent for the word \u201cdiet.\u201d  But the board also said Plano, Texas-based Dr Pepper could trademark Diet Rite Pure Zero because only full brand names, not the word \u201czero\u201d by itself, were \u201cinherently distinctive.\u201d  Dr Pepper\u2019s appeal sought to force Coca-Cola to \u201cdisclaim\u201d the word \u201czero,\u201d broadly freeing rivals to use it.  In Wednesday\u2019s decision, Circuit Judge Kathleen O\u2019Malley said the trademark board used the wrong legal approach to assess whether consumers thought \u201czero\u201d generically described low-calorie or low-carbohydrate drinks.  She also said Coca-Cola failed to counteract Dr Pepper\u2019s evidence about how companies used the word, and that the passage of time made the 2008 survey\u2019s usefulness \u201cquestionable.\u201d  The case was returned to the trademark board for further proceedings.  The case is Royal Crown Co et al v Coca-Cola Co, U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 2016-2375.","43":"(Reuters) - Earlier this year, a flood of major U.S. companies pledged to address racial inequality and promote social justice after Minneapolis police killed George Floyd, a Black man, setting off protests across the country.

REUTERS\/Lindsey Wasson\/File Photo  Companies that rushed to take a stand include household names like Home Depot Inc, Procter & Gamble Co and Coca-Cola Co. Corporate America pledged billions to promote diversity in employee ranks and the communities in which they operate, including banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co, which recently made a $30 billion commitment over the next five years.  Another set of companies, particularly in Silicon Valley, are turning more cautious, according to interviews with more than a dozen investors, entrepreneurs, executive coaches and recruiters.  Companies and employees should avoid taking public stances that stoke controversy in an increasingly polarized America, proponents of this view and their advisers told Reuters. Instead, they should focus on strategic initiatives and meeting financial targets, they said.  Management teams and boards of directors are discussing how to handle the issue, sources said, with some staying silent as a strategy and others laying out formalized ground rules detailing how executives can discuss sensitive social and political issues.  \u201cPeople are struggling with employees expecting companies to solve problems that are beyond the purview of the company,\u201d said executive coach Stephen Miles of the Miles Group.  Miles has spoken to at least 10 CEOs in recent weeks who commiserated with Brian Armstrong, the chief executive of Coinbase, whose Sept. 27 blog post explaining why the cryptocurrency company would remain apolitical brought the debate into the public square. (Blog: bit.ly\/2IG9BMm)  Coinbase and its employees should pay attention to the corporate \u201cmission\u201d and not delve into broader societal problems that distract and decrease productivity, Armstrong wrote. The company declined to comment further for this story.  After he shared it on Twitter, some founders and former senior executives of prominent tech companies replied supportively. The view may be shared even more widely in corporate America than it appears.  \u201cPeople aren\u2019t taking a public stand about this, but they are asking about it in the boardroom: \u2018What should we do?\u2019\u201d said Kathleen Utecht, managing partner at venture-capital firm Core Innovation Capital.  Utecht agrees with Armstrong. His position is more common than people may realize, she said, especially at smaller companies where management teams do not want to devote limited resources to fixing complex societal issues.  The unprecedented outpour of corporate support for racial justice lately follows several years of companies taking a stand on other issues that activists criticize them about, including climate change, the gender wage gap and LGBTQ rights.  Blue-chip corporations have not wavered from their announcements and smaller companies have taken a stand, too. On Friday, Expensify CEO David Barrett emailed the software company\u2019s 10 million users urging them to vote for Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden.  These declarations get attention, partly because of how unusual they are historically, said Harvard University professor Mike Toffel, who has studied CEO activism. It is more common now than it was five or 10 years ago, but still rare, he said, and the feeling that companies should get involved in politics is far from universal.  \u201cYou can count on a couple of hands how many examples you can find,\u201d he said. \u201cMany are not engaging.\u201d  Roughly half of the companies in the Russell 1000 did not make statements about racial inequality last summer, according to preliminary data from As You Sow, a nonprofit that advocates for corporate accountability.  Of those that did make statements, 195 were in hard-to-find locations like a CEO\u2019s LinkedIn page or staff Facebook page, not the corporate website, said Andrew Behar, As You Sow\u2019s chief executive.  Lloyd Carney, a former tech executive who sits on the boards of companies including artificial intelligence provider Nuance Communications Inc, said \u201csmart\u201d companies are taking steps to address social causes internally, but not in a splashy way. That allows them to avoid backlash from employees, customers or politicians, he said.  \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where it\u2019s better to make quiet noise,\u201d said Carney. \u201cA press release is the worst thing you can do in this highly politicized environment.\u201d  About half a dozen companies outside Silicon Valley recently set up \u201cguardrails\u201d for how executives can discuss sensitive social and political issues, like Black Lives Matter, one adviser to boards told Reuters. Executives must make it clear that they are speaking in a personal capacity on certain issues and notify boards about their comments, the adviser said.  For instance, high-tech manufacturer Sono-Tek Corp adopted a similar code of conduct in September that forbids employees from participating in politics on the job or with company resources.  The provision is especially important in today\u2019s tumultuous world and is meant to help employees feel comfortable at work, said the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Steve Bagley.  \u201cLarge businesses want people to buy their product, to support their company, whether they are hardcore Democrats or hardcore Republicans, or in between,\u201d said Ronn Torossian, head of 5W Public Relations, who talks to CEOs across a wide swath of industries. \u201cA week doesn\u2019t pass that major companies aren\u2019t discussing this.\u201d","44":"(Reuters) - The European bottling arm of Coca-Cola has sweetened its final, binding takeover offer for Australian counterpart Coca-Cola Amatil by 75 cents per share, reflecting a jump in the company\u2019s market value since an initial offer last year.

Shares in Coca-Cola Amatil, which have been gaining steadily since CCEP\u2019s initial offer was made public in October, hit an eight-year high of A$13.41 in response.  Coca-Cola has long outsourced its bottling operations to separate regional operators. It owns 31% of Amatil and 19% of CCEP, which is now by far the largest by revenue, serving 13 countries in Western Europe. While the deal would unite two companies that bottle and distribute Coca-Cola drinks, providing scale, operating efficiencies and a larger geographic spread, it also provides CCEP with a platform for further consolidation in Asia.  Amatil said it backs the offer, which would be Australia's biggest deal this year and comes after reports here that its major shareholders viewed the earlier offer of A$12.75 per share as too low.  The company\u2019s preliminary full-year results in January forecast 2020 earnings before interest and taxes of A$550.7 million, 10% ahead of expectations, while also slashing debt, on the back of a strong Christmas in Australia and New Zealand.  Monday\u2019s offer is subject to an independent expert concluding that the offer is \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d, but Jefferies analysts said CCEP was likely to seal the deal.  \u201cWe do not see a superior proposal emerging given the integrated nature of the franchise system,\u201d the brokerage\u2019s analyst Edward Mundy said.  CCEP said it would buy out 10.8% of Coca-Cola\u2019s stake in Amatil in cash, but has not yet made any decision on acquiring the rest.

According to the International Labor Organization, nearly 25 million people work in forced-labor conditions worldwide, with 47 percent of them in the Asia-Pacific region.  Food and beverage companies are under pressure to address the risk of forced labor in countries where they obtain sugarcane. A study released last year by KnowTheChain (KTC), a partnership founded by U.S.-based Humanity United, showed that most food and beverage companies fall short in their efforts to solve the problem.  The study said Coca-Cola, one of 10 global companies looked at by KTC, has committed to conduct 28 country-level studies on child labor, forced labor, and land rights for its sugar supply chains by 2020.  The U.S. beverage giant said it has been exploring multiple blockchain projects for more than a year.  Brent Wilton, the company\u2019s global head of workplace rights, said in an email to Reuters, \u201cWe are partnering with the pilot of this project to further increase transparency and efficiency of the verification process related to labor policies within our supply chain.\u201d  The new venture is intended to create a secure registry for workers and their contracts using blockchain\u2019s validation and digital notary capabilities, said Blockchain Trust Accelerator (BTA), a non-profit organization involved in the project.

The State Department said it will provide expertise on labor protection.  \u201cThe Department of State is excited to work on this innovative blockchain-based pilot,\u201d Deputy Assistant Secretary Scott Busby said in an email to Reuters, noting that while blockchain cannot compel companies or those in authority to abide by the labor contracts, it can create a validated chain of evidence that will encourage compliance with those contracts.

Coca-Cola also remains paused on Facebook and Instagram and declined to say if this changed its view. Beam Suntory, maker of Jim Beam bourbon and Courvoisier Cognac, plans to stay away from paid advertising for the rest of 2020 and reassess in 2021 based on how Facebook adjusts its approach.  Over 1,000 advertisers joined a Facebook boycott over concerns it wasn\u2019t doing enough to combat hate speech. U.S. civil rights groups enlisted multinationals to help pressure the social media giant after the June death of George Floyd, an American Black man, in police custody in Minneapolis.  \u201cBrands are very concerned about having any affiliation with the disinformation that runs through the big tech platforms,\u201d said Michael Priem, CEO of advertising technology firm Modern Impact.

Larger brands can afford to take a stance, but for smaller businesses that have already been hurt by the coronavirus pandemic, \u201cit\u2019s either make it or die,\u201d Priem said.  On Wednesday, the World Federation of Advertisers announced that social media platforms and advertisers had committed to create common definitions of harmful content such as hate speech and harmonized reporting standards.  A Facebook spokeswoman said on Friday that advertisers were returning to the platform.  \u201cFor the most part advertisers are coming back because they recognize the efforts we\u2019re making,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cWe\u2019re never satisfied.

The future of such companies is not only critical for their owners and employees, but also key for their main supplier - Coca-Cola, the world\u2019s No.1 soft drink maker - which needs them to flourish to help it recover from a slump in sales.  But COVID-19 has upended their business models.  \u201cIt was chaos. You just had no idea what the world was going through and what we were up against,\u201d said Williams, the finance head of his family\u2019s firm. \u201cIt\u2019s on our shoulders to try to take our business forward into the future and to maintain the work that our ancestors have done.\u201d  Shoppers in lockdowns snapped up cases of Coke, Fanta and Sprite at grocery stores rather than at gas stations, restaurants and stadiums.  That left bottlers scrambling to keep stores stocked with bigger, often less-profitable packages. Lucrative sales to restaurants and convenience stores are still only a fraction of what they were before the pandemic hit the United States.  The bottlers - now saddled with too much product meant for restaurants - have also been hit by a shortage of aluminum cans due to a surge in demand for canned drinks as people stay home.  Williams, whose business distributes rather than makes drinks, has adapted to this new order over the last six months, while grappling with higher costs for fuel, transportation, labor, safety gear and cleaning products. Pressures have eased since the lockdown, but his firm is still affected.  (Graphic: Coca Cola bottlers by volumes sold in 2019 vs 2016 - )  Slideshow ( 4 images )  COCA-COLA MASS LAYOFFS  Coca-Cola sells syrups, powders and base ingredients - known as concentrates - to bottlers, who mix, package and sell drinks to retailers, giving a cut back to the soda giant.  The company works with many large publicly listed bottlers around the world, including in Europe and Asia. But many U.S. players are small, family-owned businesses, with limited reserves to draw from as sales and profits shrink.  About two-thirds of them received pandemic aid from the U.S. government to keep in hand or stay afloat, which is important for Coca-Cola to increase its own sales.  All the while Coca-Cola, with whom they have a symbiotic relationship, has also been under intense pressure.  The drinks giant\u2019s volume sales in North America declined 16% in the latest quarter. Nearly 40% of its over 10,000 employees in the region will decide by Thursday whether to volunteer for severance as part of a sweeping restructuring.  \u201cIt was a very difficult time throughout April and May, in particular, and our bottlers have to deal with that on a regular basis,\u201d Chaly Moyen, Coca-Cola\u2019s North America head of strategy, told Reuters. As lockdowns have eased, worldwide volume declines have moderated, from about 25% in April to about 10% in June.  She declined to say whether Coca-Cola would bail out any bottlers close to going bankrupt.  NEW BUSINESS REALITIES  Coca-Cola is the U.S. leader in fizzy drinks - excluding tea, water and energy drinks - with about 38% of the $41.8 billion retail market, followed by PepsiCo and Keurig Dr Pepper, according to Euromonitor.  While the food-service sales that make up about half of Coca-Cola\u2019s business have dived, Moyen said North American sales to large stores have risen. At the height of the pandemic, they were up by a double-digit percentage versus a year earlier, and remain up by double-digits for 2020 so far, she added.  However she acknowledged bottlers and distributors had been hit hard by the shifting retail landscape. \u201cThe impact that bottlers had from a mix shift was real,\u201d Moyen said, adding that Coca-Cola expected the new consumer habits to stick.  Selling less product has also hurt; in the quarter ended June 26, Coca-Cola sold 22% less concentrates worldwide as demand fell.  Some bottlers have been forced to lay off or reassign workers specializing in supplying restaurants to bottling and distributing retail-friendly products, tasks in which they are not experienced, driving down productivity.  Reyes Holdings, Coca-Cola\u2019s second-biggest U.S. bottler, told Reuters it laid off 30 people - or about 6% of staff - at its Alsip facility in Illinois in April. As things improved, it reinstated half of those workers.  Coca-Cola Consolidated, the biggest U.S. Coke bottler - last month reported a 3.6% fall in quarterly net sales. But the company, whose No.1 shareholder is Coca-Cola, increased adjusted operating income by 5.4%, after furloughing about 700 people without pay.  Duane Stanford, publisher of the Beverage Digest newsletter, said such moves simply reflected the new business realities.  \u201cIn this kind of environment it\u2019s important to control costs \u2013 that absolutely comes with cutting jobs.\u201d","50":"(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co shares were set for their worst day in more than 10 years after the company forecast slowing sales in 2019, hit by a stronger dollar in the face of rising global economic uncertainty and lower demand for its fizzy sodas in some markets.

A stronger dollar is an added headache for companies like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo Inc that are already wrestling with rising freight and commodity costs even as they spend heavily on non-carbonated drinks to attract health conscious consumers.  Coca-Cola, which gets nearly two-thirds of its revenue from international markets, called out Middle East, Argentina and Turkey as being particularly weak and weighing on sales in the first half of 2019.  \u201cWe want to be prudent in our outlook guidance, given the macro environment,\u201d Chief Executive Officer James Quincey said on a post-earnings call. \u201cConsumers are under more pressure as we head into the new year.\u201d  To counter rising costs, Coca-Cola has raised prices of its beverages.

Coca-Cola forecast full-year profit to be between $2.06 and $2.10 per share, far below the average estimate of $2.23.  The company also said it expects core 2019 revenue growth of about 4 percent, down from 5 percent in 2018.  \u201cThe company seems to be playing it very conservatively on currency and taxes, but still a disappointment versus expectations,\u201d Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said.

Trade sparring between Trump and the European Union weighed on car stocks, down 1.5 percent and the worst-performing sector.

Multiple companies sell beverages with the \u201czero\u201d name, which often denotes an absence of calories or carbohydrates.  The ability to market products effectively is important to beverage makers trying to counteract declines in U.S. sales of carbonated soft drinks since their mid-2000s peak.  Lawyers for Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The companies did not immediately respond to similar requests.  Coca-Cola has used the \u201czero\u201d name on such products as Cherry Coke Zero, Sprite Zero, Powerade Zero, and more recently Coca-Cola Zero Sugar.  The Atlanta-based company\u2019s effort to register U.S. rights to 17 drinks with the word \u201czero\u201d prompted a 2007 challenge by Dr Pepper, whose products include Diet Rite Pure Zero. Coca-Cola argued that such names could confuse consumers.  In 2016, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s Trademark Trial and Appeal Board said \u201czero\u201d had \u201cacquired distinctiveness\u201d when used to sell Coca-Cola soft drinks.  The board cited a 2008 survey offered by Coca-Cola in which 61 percent of consumers associated the word \u201czero\u201d with one company, as opposed to 6 percent for the word \u201cdiet.\u201d  But the board also said Plano, Texas-based Dr Pepper could trademark Diet Rite Pure Zero because only full brand names, not the word \u201czero\u201d by itself, were \u201cinherently distinctive.\u201d  Dr Pepper\u2019s appeal sought to force Coca-Cola to \u201cdisclaim\u201d the term \u201czero,\u201d broadly freeing rivals to use it.  In Wednesday\u2019s decision, Circuit Judge Kathleen O\u2019Malley said the trademark board used the wrong legal approach to assess whether consumers thought \u201czero\u201d generically described low-calorie or low-carbohydrate drinks.  She also said Coca-Cola failed to counteract \u201cnumerous sources of evidence\u201d from Dr Pepper about how companies used the word, and that the passage of time made the 2008 survey\u2019s current usefulness \u201cquestionable.\u201d  The case was returned to the trademark board for further proceedings.

The purchase from Britain's Whitbread WTB.L of Costa's almost 4,000 outlets thrusts the world's biggest soda company into one of the few bright spots in the sluggish packaged food and drinks sector.  Paying about 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) more than some analysts had expected, Coke will use its distribution network to supercharge Costa's expansion as it chases coffee chain market leader Starbucks SBUX.O and its almost 29,000 stores across 77 markets.  Beyond coffee shops, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey, a Briton familiar with the UK brand, said Costa would provide an important growth platform ranging from beans to bottled drinks in an attractive category, growing by around 6 percent a year.  Coke already sells some coffee, such as the Georgia brand in Japan, but lacks a global offering, Quincey said in a blog post here, highlighting Costa's retail footprint, roastery, supply chain and Costa Express vending system, which the company plans to expand.  \u201cCoffee is one of the strongest growing categories in the world, and Coca-Cola needs to expand into coffee and hot drinks,\u201d he said.  Operating a retail chain marks a new challenge for 132-year-old Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, which mostly sells soft drink concentrates to a network of franchised bottlers.  It will face a fight, as rivals are also bulking up in a fragmented market, keen to attract young people prepared to pay out for barista-made drinks and developing tastes for ever more exotic coffees.  Nestle NESN.S, the market leader in packaged coffee, for example, has sealed a $7 billion licensing deal for Starbucks' retail business, while Europe's billionaire Reimann clan has built the JAB empire spanning coffee brands such as Kenco, Douwe Egberts and soft-drink maker Dr Pepper Snapple.  Bringing Costa shops to the key U.S. market would affect Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s - a major Coke customer - and JAB, which owns a string of chains including Peet\u2019s and Caribou.  Meanwhile, if Coke were to roll out canned or bottled Costa coffee drinks through its U.S. bottling system, that could upset the dominance of a joint venture between Starbucks and PepsiCo PEP.O, trade publication Beverage Digest said.  Cappuccinos sit on a table in Costa Coffee in Loughborough, Britain April 25, 2018. REUTERS\/Darren Staples  The purchase of the biggest coffee chain behind Starbucks adds to Coca-Cola\u2019s drive to diversify away from fizzy drinks and expand its options for increasingly health-conscious consumers, after countries started introducing sugar taxes.  Coke shares were down 0.4 percent in morning trade in New York as investors weighed the benefits of diversification against concerns about profitability.  \u201cWe do think investors will have questions surrounding the retail component of the business and lower operating profit margin versus legacy Coca-Cola,\u201d said JP Morgan analysts.  Coke did not change its outlook for 2018 or beyond. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2019.  CAFFEINE HIGH  Whitbread shares closed 14.3 percent higher following news of the deal, which analysts said was priced at a punchy 16.4 times Costa\u2019s latest annual earnings.  \u201cCoca-Cola are one of the few companies in the world that could justify the valuation,\u201d said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.  \u201cIts global reach should turbo-charge growth in the years to come, and hot drinks are one of the few areas of the wider beverages sector where the soft drinks giant doesn\u2019t have a killer brand. Costa will get lots of care and attention.\u201d  Whitbread had been in the process of demerging Costa from its hotel group Premier Inn, and the sale marks the latest transformation in a business that was established in 1742 as a brewer and which has also owned sports clubs and restaurants.  Whitbread bought Costa, founded in 1971 in London by Italian brothers Sergio and Bruno Costa, for 19 million pounds in 1995. It only had 39 shops then, but now its maroon shop front is one of the most ubiquitous sights on British high streets, with 2,422 outlets in the UK and a further 1,399 in international markets, operated as franchises, joint ventures and wholesale outlets.  Whitbread Chief Executive Alison Brittain said the price tag represented \u201ca substantial premium\u201d to what would have been created through a demerger.  \u201cWe were not interested in a sale other than to somebody who had a strategic rationale and therefore would be able to create significantly more value than Costa could create on its own.\u201d  Some of the proceeds will go toward reducing Whitbread\u2019s pension deficit and financial debt to ease expansion of the Premier Inn hotel chain in the UK and Germany, but Brittain said a \u201csignificant majority\u201d of the cash would go to shareholders.  Brittain also denied Whitbread had been pressured to accelerate the sale by activist investor Elliott and other hedge funds. \u201cI would imagine they would be as delighted and surprised as anybody else this morning,\u201d she told reporters.  Elliott congratulated the board on the deal and said it \u201clooks forward to continuing to engage with them to maximize the value of the remaining businesses\u201d.  CAFE CULTURE  The global market for packaged coffee and drinks was worth about $83 billion in 2017, a fraction of the $513 billion market for soft drinks, according to Euromonitor International, but it is growing faster. What is more, sales at coffee shops like Starbucks and Costa are growing even faster, as people increasingly indulge their habit on the go, rather than at home.  Costa recently expanded into China to try to offset an increasingly saturated market in Britain, where chains such as Starbucks and Caffe Nero vie with thousands of independents.  A burgeoning cafe culture in China provides an encouraging backdrop, but Costa faces intensifying competition there as well. Starbucks, which has 3,400 stores in China, plans to almost double that by 2022, while partnering with Chinese tech giant Alibaba BABA.N to start delivery services.  Local rival Luckin also plans to more than double its Chinese store count to 2,000 by the end of 2018.

Coca-Cola\u2019s investment in BodyArmor - which will make it the brand\u2019s second largest shareholder - comes as its Powerade drink competes for market share with Gatorade.

Coca-Cola, however, has historically stayed away from full-blown acquisitions, settling instead for acquiring partial stakes in companies - a strategy that allows it to test-drive potentially risky bets.

Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestle and Unilever are responsible for half a million tonnes of plastic pollution annually in the six developing countries examined in the report released by international aid agency Tearfund.  That is enough to cover 83 football pitches in a day, it said, calling the situation \u201cmorally indefensible\u201d.  Of the waste plastic, 60% is then burned by consumers on street corners, open dumps and in backyards, producing annual greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 4.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide - the same as \u201c2 million cars on UK roads a year\u201d, the charity added.  Petrochemicals derived from oil and gas, which are carbon-rich fossil fuels, form the building blocks for plastic products.  Globally, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere hit a new record high in 2018, reinforcing damaging weather patterns, the World Meteorological Organization said in November.  An earlier 2019 report from UK-based Tearfund found that up to a million people die every year in poor countries from illnesses caused by discarded waste and plastic pollution.  Of the four multinational companies in the new study, Coca-Cola is \u201cby far the worst polluter\u201d, responsible for emissions greater than the other three combined, as about 8 billion of its bottles are burned or dumped each year in the six countries, Tearfund said.  In a statement, Coca-Cola said it was working to increase the use of returnable and refillable packaging, citing examples in five of the countries in the report - Brazil, India, Mexico, Nigeria and the Philippines - but did not mention China.  The company was aiming for every plastic bottle to contain \u201cat least 50% recycled plastic by 2030\u201d, it said, adding that the Tearfund report \u201craises some serious issues\u201d.  PepsiCo, identified as the second-worst polluter, said it had set a target to decrease \u201cvirgin plastic content\u201d across its beverage business by 35% by 2025.  Nestle, the world\u2019s biggest food company, said it was committed to making 100% of its packaging recyclable or reusable by 2025.  Tearfund, however, said the brands should be doing more, adding that only consumer goods giant Unilever had committed to reduce its total plastic use, which the company said would amount to a decrease of more than 100,000 tonnes by 2025.  Unilever also said in a statement it planned to help collect and process more plastic packaging than it sells by 2025.","85":"(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co KO.N on Friday joined a list of big U.S. companies laying off thousands of workers in response to the coronavirus crisis, offering voluntary deals across its businesses and promising to halve its number of operating units.

Coca-Cola\u2019s previous deal ran to 2020 and the new agreement with China\u2019s top milk products manufacturer, which will span six Olympic Games, makes it the longest Olympic sponsor, the U.S. drinks maker having first supported the Games in 1928.  \u201cIt is a substantial arrangement.

The announcement is a major boost for the IOC, strengthening its financial future as interest in the world\u2019s biggest multi-sports event has waned in the last few years.  Mengniu is the latest Asian company to join as top sponsors after Bridgestone, Toyota and Alibaba in recent years and reflects the region\u2019s growing influence of global business.  \u201cThis long-term agreement is another demonstration of the relevance and stability of the Olympic Games in these times of uncertainty,\u201d IOC President Thomas Bach said.

Coke has previously taken a cautious approach to energy drinks as they are wrought with controversy in both the United States and international markets after some drinks were linked to deaths in young people.  The company initially took a nearly 17 percent stake in energy drinks maker Monster Beverage Corp MNST.O in 2015, making Coke the largest shareholder, to sample at a distance the market in which it had a small presence with its NOS and Full throttle brands.  However, the partnership has turned rocky with Coke currently in arbitration with Monster Beverage over the launch of the Coke energy drinks, as it would put it in direct competition with Monster and violate their initial 2015 agreement.  \u201cWe have submitted the difference in interpretation to an arbitration panel for resolution, which is the mechanism agreed by the Coca-Cola Co and Monster in the original agreements,\u201d a Coca-Cola spokesperson said.  Analysts, however, were skeptical whether consumers would take to Coke\u2019s energy drinks under a brand mainly associated with fizzy sodas.  \u201cWhile Coca-Cola certainly has the distribution muscle to push new offerings, we question the fit of an energy drink under the Coca-Cola trademark,\u201d Cowen & Co analyst Vivien Azer said.  Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan said he did not think Coke\u2019s new line of beverages would gain meaningful market share as consumers of energy drinks opt for something edgier.  Astrachan said Coca-Cola may be using the launch to enhance the consumption of trademark Coke drinks rather than materially change its relationship with Monster that is currently worth about $6 billion.

Coke confirmed to Reuters that it was developing two energy drinks and that it had filed for arbitration with Monster.

FILE PHOTO: A villager and his family paddle a wooden canoe on the Fly River near the township of Kiunga in the Western Province of Papua New Guinea, November 3, 1997. REUTERS\/David Gray\/File Photo  But getting the proceeds out of the South Pacific nation is proving much more troublesome, undermining efforts by the host of this month\u2019s APEC meeting to portray itself as an attractive destination for international investment.  Australian-listed Coca-Cola Amatil CCL.AX, which distributes Coke in the region, recently disclosed it was holding more of PNG's kina PGK= currency than it wanted due to foreign exchange restraints, a complaint echoed by other big businesses.  The restrictions, used to prop up the kina by fixing its value in a narrow band, have created a shortage of dollars and a weeks-long queue to buy them. That is stifling business investment and with it, the country\u2019s economic prospects, business leaders say.  \u201cFor most customers, it has provided an impediment to the growth of their business,\u201d said Robin Fleming, Chief Executive of Bank South Pacific, PNG\u2019s biggest commercial bank and largest foreign exchange dealer.  \u201cIt\u2019s really strained some of those relationships with their suppliers overseas,\u201d he said on the phone from his office in the dusty seaside capital, Port Moresby.  DIGGING IN  Port Moresby is the venue for this month\u2019s Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit of world leaders and PNG is hoping to use the high-profile event to showcase the nation and its investment credentials.  PNG Prime Minister Peter O\u2019Neill said earlier this year that after APEC, \u201ceveryone will remember where Papua New Guinea is\u201d and not confuse it with an African country.  Papua New Guinea has one of the largest economies in the Pacific Islands region, backed by mining, timber, fishing and huge energy reserves.  Riding booming commodity prices, the kina touched as high as $0.47 in 2013 but fell as low as $0.33 the following year when the oil price plunged.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  Demand for kina also dropped away sharply since the end of construction in 2014 of a giant LNG project led by Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N.  The dollar shortfall was exacerbated by lower-than-expected tax receipts from the PNG LNG project and disruptions to copper and gold exports.  Papua New Guinea\u2019s central bank responded by fixing the currency to a 150 basis point band either side of about $0.41 in June 2014. That made dollars cheaper overnight, driving a spike in demand exceeding meager supplies held locally by exporters.  Demand for foreign currency exceeded supply by about $500 million in August, according to Papua New Guinea\u2019s central bank\u2019s most recent policy update.  That has left businesses - even those earmarked for priority access to foreign currency such as food, fuel, aviation and medicine - pleading with suppliers to accept late payments.  \u201cIt does make it a challenge to get the currency you need to import materials,\u201d such as sugar, aluminum tins and plastic bottles, Coca-Cola Amatil\u2019s Sydney-based spokesman Patrick Low said.  Meanwhile, CCA\u2019s stockpile of cash in kina jumped by more than a third over the 12 months to June 30 to 687 million kina ($200 million), half-year accounts show.  Other businesses find themselves similarly hamstrung.  \u201cWe need to minimize our purchasing in Australia,\u201d said Ariel Sarangya, who manages a computer shop in the highlands and has cut back buying stock due to a lack of foreign currency.  \u201cYou need to wait up to three months, sometimes more than that, it\u2019s up to the banks. We have to take whatever they give.\u201d  Heineken HEIN.AS subsidiary South Pacific Brewery Ltd has quit all non-essential capital expenditure since the crunch began and has struggled to remit dividends to its parent, managing director, Stan Joyce, told Reuters.  The company even briefly considered buying coffee and trying to sell that offshore to bring in some U.S. dollars, he added.  DIGGING OUT  Economists say the solution is to let the kina gradually fall to encourage dollars to flow.  But the government is staking its hopes on an anticipated $13 billion in foreign investment expected as part of an expansion of the PNG LNG project, and recovering commodity prices, to stabilize the currency.  It has also cut dollar-denominated imports of fuel and last month raised $500 million with its debut sovereign bond issue.  \u201cMuch work going into import replacement, bringing fishing and logging industries processing onshore, lowering transport, energy and communication costs,\u201d Treasurer Charles Abel said in an email, adding the backlog should be cleared by year\u2019s end.  Businesses and economists are less sure, and say restraints need to be dropped before investment flows again.  In the meantime, though, Coke is flowing just fine, with PNG revenue and earnings up for the half-year.  \u201cThe most popular drink here in Papua New Guinea is Coke,\u201d said Raymond Yafus, a storeman at a supermarket in PNG\u2019s second-largest city, Lae.","123":"April 23 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks opened higher on Tuesday, led by gains in technology stocks and upbeat earnings from a handful of companies including Coca-Cola and Twitter.

Coca-Cola makes syrups and concentrates and through its bottlers distributes them to fast-food chains, theaters, amusement parks and other venues, most of which have either closed all operations or limited their businesses.  Several concerts and sporting events, including the company-sponsored Tokyo 2020 Olympics, have been postponed or canceled.  As a result, volumes fell about 25% globally since the beginning of April, largely stemming from the loss of sales other than at retail stores, the company said.  The hit to second-quarter results will be material, it said, though the ultimate impact on this quarter and the rest of the year is unknown at this time. Coca-Cola added it expected comparable revenue to include 4% to 5% hit from a stronger dollar.  The Atlanta-based beverage maker said, however, it saw stockpiling in some markets and a sharp rise in e-commerce sales, as consumers rushed to buy goods in preparation for lockdowns.  \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not the case that e-commerce is offsetting the losses... E-commerce, even though it\u2019s doubled in sales, for a beverage category, it\u2019s still a very small percentage of the total beverage category,\u201d Chief Executive Officer James Quincey told analysts.

Bottles of Coca-Cola are seen at a Carrefour Hypermarket store in Montreuil, near Paris, France, February 5, 2018.

Coca-Cola sued the IRS, disputing the bill. The case is being tried now in U.S. Tax Court in Washington. A verdict is not expected for some time after the trial ends, expected in mid-April.  The case is being watched closely by tax experts as a sign of rising tension between tax authorities and multinational corporations over transfer pricing, that is, the way companies value the goods, services, trademark and patent rights that they constantly move among foreign units across national boundaries.  An important management discipline inside multinationals, transfer pricing is under more scrutiny than ever before from tax agencies worldwide because of strict new global standards, raising legal risks for companies and their investors.  The Coca-Cola case goes to trial as interest among corporations in seeking multi-year deals with the IRS covering transfer pricing arrangements has fallen in the past two years.  The IRS reported on Friday that it received 101 applications in 2017 for \u201cadvance pricing agreements\u201d (APAs), similar to 2016\u2019s level of 98 in 2016, but well below 2015\u2019s peak of 183.  APA applications also fell in 2016 in Japan, the top U.S. bilateral APA partner, according to the latest data.  Anecdotal evidence suggests the APA process, designed to prevent conflict, is under strain in many countries, with some tax lawyers citing Mexico, Italy and China as challenging.  Corporate tax directors at a conference in Washington earlier this month said APAs are taking longer to negotiate and government tax agencies are less willing to do them.  \"We're really living in a different time and we can understand why tax authorities might be reluctant because there's a lot more external scrutiny than there ever was,\" said Amy Roberti, director of global tax and fiscal policy for Procter & Gamble Co PG.N, at the conference.  Asked for more details afterward, Roberti said through a company spokeswoman that APAs help Procter & Gamble build \u201crelationships with governments and fiscal authorities.\u201d  The IRS did not immediately provide answers to questions about the Coca-Cola case and transfer pricing, in general.  Coca-Cola responded to questions by providing an internal employee memo about the case that said, \u201cThe company firmly believes that the IRS\u2019 claims are without merit and will pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies.\u201d  TRANSFER PRICING CHALLENGE  The IRS contends that Coca-Cola charged several foreign affiliates royalties that were too low from 2007 to 2009, which reduced the parent company\u2019s U.S. income and resulted in underpayment of its U.S. income taxes by $3.3 billion.  Tax agencies often challenge transfer pricing arrangements on the grounds that they are set up to minimize income in high-tax countries and maximize it in low-tax countries.  Under a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting framework set up by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2016, one hundred national tax agencies including the IRS expect companies to use an \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d approach to transfer pricing.  That means, in the case of trademark rights, for instance, charging foreign units royalties equal to their open market value. The trouble is that trademarks are usually unique. So approximating their \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d price is difficult.  Coca-Cola says in court filings that the IRS approved the company\u2019s method for setting its transfer prices for the affiliates in a 1996 agreement, but that the IRS later withdrew that approval and issued the bill for back taxes.  Coca-Cola did not have an APA with the IRS. Instead, it had an APA-like \u201caudit closing agreement\u201d that dated back to 1996 and was, the company says, reaffirmed in later audits.  But much changed in transfer pricing over the more than 20 years since Coca-Cola reached its understanding with the IRS.  \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting case,\u201d said former IRS Acting Commissioner Steven Miller. \u201cIf I were a tax director, I would be thinking about how much I can rely on agreements like this.  \u201cIt does drive home how important it is not to just assume that an agreement can be relied on forever because apparently, maybe not,\u201d said Miller, now national director of tax at consulting firm Alliantgroup."}}
