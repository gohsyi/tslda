Big-box retailer Target Corp surged 19.5%, set for its biggest one-day percentage jump, after it raised its annual earnings forecast. Home improvement chain Lowe\u2019s Cos Inc climbed 9.8% as it joined bigger rival Home Depot Inc in beating profit estimates.  The reports come on the heels of solid earnings from Walmart Inc and strong retail sales data last week that allayed fears of a U.S. recession.  Together their shares helped the retail index rise 2.24% and consumer discretionary sector 1.78%, the most among the major S&P sectors.  \u201cInvestors are counting on the strength of consumer spending,\u201d said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.  \u201cWhen they see good earnings in the sector, it gives them some confidence, particularly when there is a lot of concern about non-internet retailers.\u201d  Adding to the upbeat sentiment, Bank of America Corp Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan played down fears of a potential U.S. recession and said strong consumer spending could keep the economy growing.  At 13:52 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 270.74 points, or 1.04%, at 26,233.18, the S&P 500 was up 23.28 points, or 0.80%, at 2,923.79. The Nasdaq Composite was up 67.16 points, or 0.84%, at 8,015.72.  The highlight of the day will be the minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s July meeting, when it cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade. The details of the meeting are due to be released at 2 p.m. ET.  As U.S.-China trade tensions took a turn for the worse since the Fed\u2019s move last month and added to risks of slowing economic growth, investors will closely monitor comments from Chair Jerome Powell on Friday at the Jackson Hole Symposium for clues on what more the central bank plans to do to boost growth.  Meckler expects to see a dovish tone in Powell\u2019s speech, \u201cnot so much because the U.S. is having economic problems but its a recognition of the fact that the rest of the world is having an economic slowdown.\u201d  Yields in U.S. Treasuries bonds ticked higher on Wednesday, a day after their fall pressured Wall Street and paused a strong rebound from last week\u2019s selloff on recession fears.  All S&P sectors were higher with the defensive utilities , consumer staples and real estate sectors posting the smallest gains, reflecting investor appetite for risk.  Toll Brothers Inc slipped 3.8% after the luxury homebuilder posted a decline in orders, hinting at weaker demand for new homes.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.73-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 2.22-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.  The S&P index recorded 26 new 52-week highs and four new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 55 new highs and 56 new lows.

The preliminary settlement filed on Thursday with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan requires a judge\u2019s approval.  It resolves claims that the Minneapolis-based retailer, which has performed background checks for employment in U.S. stores since 2001, violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employers from discriminating based on race, gender and other characteristics.  Target was accused of having \u201cimported the racial and ethnic disparities\u201d in the U.S. criminal justice system into its hiring process, in part by disqualifying job applicants for convictions that were unrelated to the work they sought.  The settlement calls for eligible blacks and Hispanics who were since May 2006 wrongly denied hourly and entry-level jobs such as cashiers, cart attendants, food service workers and stockers to receive $1.2 million or \u201cpriority hiring.\u201d  Another $600,000 will go to nonprofits that help people with criminal histories reenter the workforce, while most of the rest will cover legal and other fees, the settlement said.

Jenna Reck, a Target spokeswoman, said the retailer no longer asks for criminal histories in job applications, but still considers convictions \u201cimportant\u201d and gathers criminal background information late in the hiring process.  \u201cWe have a number of measures in place to ensure we\u2019re fair and equitable in our hiring,\u201d while \u201cmaintaining a safe and secure working and shopping environment for team members and guests,\u201d she said.

On Wednesday, Walmart Inc WMT.N, Kroger Co KR.N and Kohls Corp KSS.N had decided to implement the policy at all their outlets.  Target TGT.N said it would launch the policy from August 1, with an exception for those with underlying medical conditions and young children.

CVS CVS.N will also launch the rule at its pharmacies from Monday, but said it was not asking its employees to act as enforcers.

REUTERS\/Jonathan Alcorn  The Minneapolis-based retailer will offer free two-day shipping on hundreds of thousands of items from Nov. 1 to Dec. 22 with no order minimum or membership required. Target had announced the shipping service in March.  Target\u2019s two-day shipping option is less expensive than Amazon.com Inc\u2019s, which requires an annual subscription fee of $119 under its Prime membership service. Walmart Inc offers free two-day shipping for a minimum order of $35.  Target will also expand its Drive Up Service, which allows customers to place orders online and have packages brought to their cars by the retailer\u2019s employees. It will include nearly 1,000 stores by the end of October, ahead of schedule.  The company currently fulfills about 50 percent of its digital orders from inventory at its stores and plans to increase that to 90 percent.  Target will also offer same-day delivery on 55,000 items with Shipt, a company it bought for $550 million last year, in \u201chundreds of markets.\u201d Shipt will offer the service in 200 markets, up from 160 announced earlier.  The biggest changes the retailer has made to its business over the past five years have been on order fulfillment, the final mile of delivering orders from a warehouse or store to shoppers\u2019 homes, Target Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell told reporters at a briefing on Tuesday.  The offerings will be part of the \u201cTarget Run and Done\u201d holiday promotional campaign.  Cornell also said Target\u2019s holiday hiring plans are on schedule. The retailer has received over 100,000 applications in a tight labor market and is seeing a 40 percent rise in job applications for its warehouses. In September, Target said it would hire 120,000 seasonal workers at wages starting at $12 an hour. The company has made a commitment to go up to $15 an hour by 2020.  Last week, Target said it will dedicate nearly a quarter of a million square feet of new space to its toy business across 500 stores, seeking more holiday toy sales after retailer Toys \u201cR\u201d Us Inc went bankrupt this year. Target had said its shoppers will be able to shop for more than 2,500 new and exclusive toys.  Rival Walmart Inc has made a similar push for gaining market share in toys.  In August, Target reported its strongest comparable store sales growth in 13 years and said a strong economy lifted customer visits to the most in a decade.  U.S. holiday sales in 2018 will increase by 4.3 percent to 4.8 percent from a year ago, when consumer spending surged to a 12-year high, according to The National Retail Federation.  The trade body said holiday sales growth will be higher than an average increase of 3.9 percent over the past five years but slower than last year\u2019s 5.3 percent gain, when consumer spending grew the most since 2005, boosted by tax cuts.","11":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart Inc WMT.N, Target Corp TGT.N and Best Buy Co BBY.N have made changes to their gift card programs to reduce the risk of fraud as consumers enter the holiday shopping season.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Barbara Underwood and Josh Shapiro, the attorneys general of New York and Pennsylvania, announced the changes on Tuesday, as part of a more than year-long initiative to thwart scam artists.  The changes include reducing purchase limits on store-branded gift cards in a single transaction, limiting how much can be loaded onto the cards, and prohibiting the redemption of store-branded gift cards for other gift cards.  Walmart, Target and Best Buy also bolstered training to help employees spot scams and warn potential victims.  \u201cBy working collaboratively with these retailers, we\u2019ve created a way for businesses to take proactive steps to prevent scams,\u201d Underwood said in a statement.  The National Retail Federation said gift cards are the most popular item on consumers\u2019 wish lists for the 12th straight year, requested by 60 percent of 7,313 people surveyed.  Last month, the Federal Trade Commission said 26 percent of victims reporting scams between January and September said they paid with gift cards, up from just 7 percent in 2015.  Losses through September from gift and 'reload' cards totaled $53 million, up from $40 million for all of 2017, with a median loss of about $500 per incident. (here)  Regulators said scammers often use retail gift cards to buy third-party cards such as iTunes, Steam and Google Play that can be resold on the black market, and impersonate other people to swindle unwitting victims.  Common impersonations include grandchildren claiming they got into trouble, such as arrests or accidents, and needed money for bail or lawyers; Internal Revenue Service agents claiming, often angrily, that taxes were owed; and tech support employees seeking payments to fix alleged viruses on victims\u2019 computers.  Underwood and Shapiro said retail gift cards cannot be used for such expenses, and that the IRS does not cold-call people.  They also said consumers should not volunteer gift card numbers to people they don\u2019t know, and should contact state consumer officials or law enforcement if they believe they were targeted.","12":"(Reuters) - Target Corp reported a 17.2% rise in comparable sales for the holiday season on Wednesday as its online sales more than doubled, thanks to faster deliveries and higher demand for home goods, electronics and beauty products.  A large chunk of the sales growth came from same-day deliveries and store pick-up services, areas where the Minneapolis-based retailer has been investing heavily during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Deep-pocketed retailers such as Target and Walmart Inc are using the disruption brought on by the health crisis as an opportunity to gain market share from smaller brick-and-mortar rivals struggling to survive the impact of the pandemic.  Target in December sold 150 million items through services that allow customers to collect their online purchases from stores, almost four times more than the same period a year earlier.  The sales surge came as retailers spread out their holiday season promotions to prevent crowding at stores, instead of focusing on a few specific days.  In a blog post, Target said on Wednesday it would keep its nearly 1,900 U.S. stores closed on Thanksgiving this year, repeating the measure it had taken in 2020.  \u201cIt is even less likely retailers will return to the big sales bonanza of Thanksgiving and Black Friday even when the pandemic is over,\u201d said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.  Target said sales trends in January has been strong. Analysts on average expect its fourth-quarter comparable sales, which includes January, to rise 12.7%.  However, analysts at Gordon Haskett said the retailer had likely missed the more optimistic expectations of 18%-19% growth, which is closer to what Target had seen in the third quarter.  Shares of the company, which have gained about 60% over the last 12 months, fell 1% in early trading.","13":"Jan 13 (Reuters) - Target Corp said on Wednesday its comparable sales rose 17.2% in November and December as its online sales more than doubled during the holiday period.

Comparable digital sales rose 155% in the third quarter, the company said, driven largely by same-day services like Drive up, Shipt or straight in-store pick ups, with more than 95% of sales being fulfilled through stores.  Target has emerged as one of the big winners from the disruption caused by the health crisis as investments in its private label and online business, including faster shipments, pay off.  \u201cThose investments turned out to be crucial. Without them, we would not have been able to meet the extraordinary demand driven by the pandemic,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said on a media call.  Store traffic at Target also rose in the quarter, unlike at bigger rival Walmart, even with people making fewer trips outdoors.  Comparable sales, which include online and store sales, rose 20.7% in the third quarter ended Oct.31, trouncing expectations of an 11.31% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Electronics sales jumped more than 50%, while comparable sales for the home category were up in the mid-20% range.  The pandemic has also forced retailers to bring forward their holiday promotions, casting a shadow over the traditional holiday shopping season from Thanksgiving to Christmas day.  \u201cMany have started to shop earlier and we do expect it (shopping) to be spread out during the holiday season, but they are looking to celebrate and ... we expect a lot of gift giving,\u201d Cornell said.  Target\u2019s net earnings rose to $1.01 billion, from $714 million a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $2.79 per share.

The company, one of the retailers benefiting from the big shift to online shopping during the health crisis, said it expected seasonal hiring to be on par with last year, when it hired more than 130,000 store employees.  Consumers have been increasingly shopping online and either have items delivered to their homes or collect them at a nearby store as they stay indoors.  According to a forecast from Deloitte, e-commerce sales are expected to record a 25% to 35% rise in the 2020 holiday season, traditionally the busiest time of the year.  \u201cWe\u2019re building even more flexibility into our seasonal staffing as we enter into, what is sure to be, an unprecedented holiday shopping season,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell told reporters on a briefing call, adding that the company would also offer additional hours of work starting with current staff.  During the first half of the year, more than 10 million consumers shopped on Target\u2019s website and demand for same-day fulfillment options quadrupled, the retailer said, leading it to train more staff in areas that are in demand such as \u2018drive up and order pickup.\u2019  Distribution centers will send more inventory to stores than usual to make sure in-demand items are well stocked, and to ensure smooth operation the company said it would hire more full-time and seasonal warehouse team members across the country than last year.

The retailer has spent billions of dollars on its push to compete with the ease of delivery provided by Amazon.com Inc and Walmart Inc, buying grocery delivery firm Shipt, and building in-store pickup and drive-up services.  Target said one out of five customers who used its same-day service in the quarter were new, with shoppers collecting their orders from stores within a couple of minutes of placing them through the company\u2019s mobile app or website.  \u201cQ2 could not have gone better for Target,\u201d Charlie O\u2019Shea, a vice president at ratings agency Moody\u2019s, said of the results.  Led since 2014 by retail-industry veteran Brian Cornell, Target has bounced back from a slide three years ago which saw its margins drop, prompting a rethink that has seen it remodel hundreds of stores each year since.  Like Walmart it has refitted its business to deal with the challenge presented by Amazon and other online retailers, also developing its line of own-brand goods to boost profits.  Wednesday\u2019s results showed the company\u2019s same-day services drove more than three-fourths of a 34% increase in comparable digital sales in the quarter. Those online sales accounted for more than half of its total same-store sales.  FILE PHOTO: An empty shopping cart stands outside a target store during a Black Friday sales event in Westbury, New York, U.S., November 23, 2018. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  \u201cBecause these options leverage our store infrastructure, technology and teams, same-day fulfillment delivers outstanding financial performance as well,\u201d Cornell told a post earnings call.  The company\u2019s stock, which had already risen 29% this year, jumped 19% to a record high of $102.02, driving gains in other retail players and adding to broad gains for Wall Street.  NO MARGIN SLIP  The quicker deliveries, Target executives said, also powered profitability as margins expanded for the first time in nearly three years, rising 30 basis points to 30.6% in the quarter.  That reflected a stronger product mix and optimization of pricing, the company said, at a time when Walmart\u2019s margins dropped 46 basis points. Macy\u2019s, Kohl\u2019s and J.C. Penney have all reported disappointing results in the past week.  \u201cWhile many department store peers struggle to sustain positive traffic and stable gross margins, Target is finding the right balance,\u201d Evercore analyst Greg Melich said.  Target\u2019s comparable sales rose by a better-than-expected 3.4% as demand for apparel, toys and beauty products rose. Late in the quarter, the retailer also benefited from back-to-school promotions.  Its strategy of opening smaller locations in college towns and urban areas, and stocking more own-brand goods, helped store traffic grow 2.4%.  Earlier this week, the company said it was starting a new food and beverage brand, Good & Gather, that would hit stores in September.  Target expects full-year adjusted profit to be between $5.90 and $6.20 per share, up from the prior range of $5.75 to $6.05 per share. The outlook accounted for potential additional U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports.  Excluding certain items, it earned $1.82 per share, beating the average analyst estimate by 20 cents. Total revenue rose 3.6% to $18.42 billion, above expectations of $18.34 billion.","19":"Slideshow ( 3 images )  (Reuters) - The Trump Administration\u2019s coronavirus relief payment provided a fillip to sales of major retailers in April as millions of Americans used the money to buy everything from video games to sewing machines even as the country struggles with record job losses.  Walmart WMT.N and Target Corp TGT.N noted in their earnings call this week that quarterly comparable sales, which rose about 10%, got a major boost from increased demand for non-essentials at the end of last month.  \u201cCall it relief spending, as it was heavily influenced by stimulus dollars,\u201d Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said on Tuesday, citing a jump in sales of clothing, televisions, video games, sporting goods and toys.  The U.S. government doled out relief checks of $1,200 in late April to help tens of millions of households cover essentials and cope with the financial distress brought on by the coronavirus pandemic as job losses reached 20 million.  However, as lockdown restrictions were eased, Americans moved away from stockpiling staples and instead splurged on discretionary big-ticket items, helping boost margins for retailers.  The shift also helped specialty retailers such as Best Buy BBY.N and Advance Auto Parts Inc AAP.N.  \u201cWe did see an increase on the week of the stimulus, but the week after the stimulus was better ... And then two weeks after was better than one week after. So we are seeing that sequential improvement,\u201d Advance Auto Chief Executive Tom Greco said.  Target CEO Brian Cornell said the company saw an increase in online and store traffic, both tied to the extra cash, but cautioned that the bump could be short-lived.  Edward Jones analyst Brain Yarbrough concurred, saying, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect the trends you\u2019ve seen in late April and potentially in the beginning of May to continue. That wouldn\u2019t be realistic.\u201d","20":"(Reuters) - A surge in Target Corp's TGT.N online sales due to panic buying during the coronavirus crisis helped the big-box retailer post better-than-expected quarterly results on Wednesday, even as it grappled with soaring operational costs.  Target, like Walmart WMT.N, benefited from customers stockpiling staples and cleaning products at the start of the quarter, while demand for non-staple items like beauty products, home goods and clothes rose as stimulus checks arrived late in April.  Although U.S. grocers and supermarket chains have seen a monumental surge in sales during the quarter, they have little to show in terms of profit as most of their funds were spent on bonuses and overtime payments to keep stores running during the pandemic.  \u201cLast quarter was unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Target\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell told reporters. \u201cIt was intense, it was volatile, it was stressful for our guests and the country.\u201d  Overall, online comparable sales jumped 141%, benefiting from investments in same-day delivery services such as in-store pick up, Drive-up and Shipt, and accounted for almost all of its same-store sales growth for the first quarter ended May 2.  Net profit, however, fell 64.3% in the quarter as operating costs rose 11%.  Target, which has already pulled its financial targets for the year, is setting aside nearly $500 million to spend on maintaining safety standards at stores and pay employees higher wages.  \u201cThere\u2019s just so much uncertainty as I think about the balance of the year ... Obviously we\u2019re watching closely to see what happens from an economic standpoint,\u201d Cornell said.  On an adjusted basis, the company earned 59 cents per share, beating already lowered expectations of 40 cents.  \u201cTarget is prioritizing being open for customers ... This strategy makes sense, although near term results are likely to remain volatile,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst Greg Melich said.","21":"(Repeats story to fix formatting with no changes to text)  April 23 (Reuters) - A surge in online sales for Target Corp in March and April offset the bulk of damage done by coronavirus lockdowns to in-store sales, but its margins continue to suffer along with profit from higher costs, the retailer said on Thursday.  The big box retailer said digital comparable sales had surged over 275% so far in April, with several days in the month recording more online sales than Cyber Monday, traditionally the busiest day for e-commerce companies.  However, the company expects margins to drop by 5-percentage points in the first quarter due to temporary wage increases of $2 an hour for store and distribution center workers as well as higher sales of low-margin products such as groceries. The company now plans to pay higher wages until May 30.  Target, along with Kroger and Costco, is among a few companies that has benefited from the spread of the pandemic.  Other players in retail, especially apparel chains and department stores, have taken a big hit from the pandemic, with some of them on the verge of filing for bankruptcy.  \u201cWatching the retail industry decline is not something I enjoy, but I think going forward we\u2019re going to see significant market share opportunities, across our apparel business,\u201d Target Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said on a media call.  \u201cThat\u2019ll be a benefit to us. But unfortunately, it will come at the expense of others who are closing their doors and potentially no longer operating in this future environment.\u201d  A surge in online shopping more than made up for a mid-teens decline in comparable store sales for the company in April.  Overall comparable sales have risen more than 5%.  Sales of food and beverage items rose over 12% in April, while those of toys and electronics jumped over 30%. In contrast, sales of apparel and accessories tumbled more than 40%.  Target said quarter-to-date comparable sales have risen over 7%, with digital sales more than doubling.

The big-box retailer said it now plans to remodel only about 130 stores in 2020, down from 300, moving the rest of the projects to 2021. Target added it would open fewer small format stores than it had previously planned.  \u201cIt\u2019s become very clear that we need to be disciplined about making sure our stores and supply chain is focused on serving our guests without any unnecessary distractions,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said.  \u201cWe\u2019ll need to prioritize the flow of food, medicine and other essentials for the foreseeable future.\u201d  In the past few weeks, consumers have been flocking to stores to load up on canned food, disinfectants, toilet paper and other essentials as the pandemic keeps Americans confined to their homes, forcing retailers including Target to put limits on the number of items that can be bought in one shopping trip.  Cornell said demand has been \u201cunprecedented,\u201d likening the buying behavior to levels occasionally seen during natural disasters.  Target had laid out its full-year, first-quarter forecasts and investment plans for 2020 just three weeks earlier and last year announced a new share repurchase program of $5 billion. The buyback has now been suspended.  Till date in March, overall same-store sales at Target was up more than 20% from a year earlier, with sales of essentials, food and beverage up more than 50%.  The company also expects higher-than-anticipated costs, driven by an increase in pay and benefits for frontline workers, and for maintaining essential inventory.  Target, like many other retailers, has reduced store hours for cleaning and restocking and said last week it would raise the minimum wage by $2 an hour for store and distribution center workers through May 2.  Rivals such as Amazon.com Inc and Walmart Inc have also boosted pay and gone on a hiring spree to manage a surge in orders.  The virus, which has infected more than 44,000 people in the United States leading to more than 500 deaths, has resulted in the closure of several businesses and raised concerns of a global recession.  \u201cThere is no playbook for how to react in this environment.

The retailer said no guest information was compromised.  Earlier on Saturday, Target tweeted bit.ly\/2WKO1HY that it was aware guests could not make purchases and apologized for the inconvenience.

This year\u2019s shopping period is the shortest since 2013.  The hiring plans often indicate the sales expectations of retailers and come against the backdrop of softening retail job environment and escalating trade war between Beijing and Washington that has threatened to increase costs for retailers.  \u201cRetailers are still trying to minimize the impact of the trade war on consumers by bringing in as much merchandise as they can before each new round of tariffs takes effect and drives up prices,\u201d National Retail Federation Vice President for Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said.

United Parcel Service Inc, the world\u2019s biggest parcel delivery firm, said on Monday it was planning to hire 100,000 holiday workers, after it invested billions of dollars to automate package sorting centers.  Retail employment contracted for a seventh straight month in August to hit the lowest level since January 2016. Department store jobs, which have been hard hit by online competition, sunk to the lowest point since the federal government started tracking the data in 1990.  Kohl\u2019s Corp said in July that it had started hiring across 500 of its stores for the holidays, while Amazon.com said on Monday it is starting its seasonal hiring in the coming weeks.  Target\u2019s roughly 8% rise in holiday hiring is much lower than the 20% increase a year earlier and a 43% jump in 2017.  Janet Kloppenburg, president at retail research firm JJK Research Associates, said a rise in digital sales reduces the need for incremental store payroll for retailers.  Retailers have been investing more on their websites and mobile apps as consumers prefer to shop online and have it delivered to their doorstep or pick up in stores.

The company, one of the retailers benefiting from the big shift to online shopping during the health crisis, said it expected seasonal hiring to be on par with last year, when it hired more than 130,000 store employees.

To spur growth, Target is revamping its supply chain, strengthening online delivery services, investing in its own brands and employees, and connecting its online and store shopping experiences for customers, Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said at an investor meeting at Target\u2019s headquarters in Minneapolis.  Earlier in the day, the retailer reported fourth-quarter profit that missed estimates, gross margins that were at their lowest in 20 years, and gave a disappointing forecast for first-quarter comparable sales. Shares were down 4 percent at $72.10 after earlier sinking more than 5 percent.  \u201c2017 was all about putting down a plan, getting the wheels turning in the right direction,\u201d Cornell said. \u201c2018 is about acceleration, leveraging our greatest assets and leaning in to our competitive strength.\u201d  The retailer plans $3 billion of capital expenditure this year to support those investments, remodel stores and strengthen online operations to stay competitive. In February last year, Target said it would reinvest more than $7 billion through 2020.  The company said it would introduce free two-day shipping without a membership requirement, following larger rival Walmart Inc WMT.N, which introduced the feature last year on orders of $35 or more. Target did not say if the free shipping was conditional upon a minimum order of a certain value.  Target said more than half its online order volume was shipped or picked up from stores, a key factor driving online sales growth of 29 percent during the fourth quarter. That made it a fourth straight annual jump in online sales of more than 25 percent in the year through Feb. 3.  FILE PHOTO: Shoppers exit a Target store during Black Friday shopping in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, U.S., November 24, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  MISSING EXPECTATIONS  Earlier in the day, Target missed fourth-quarter earnings expectations for a third consecutive year.  Looking forward, the company expects only modest comparable sales growth in the low single digits for the first quarter, with analysts expecting 2.36 percent. It expects adjusted earnings of $1.25 to $1.45 per share, against analyst estimates for $1.40 per share.  For the full year, Target reiterated its forecast from January, expecting adjusted earnings of $5.15 to $5.45 a share, compared to analyst estimates for $5.27 per share.  The earnings miss bucked strong fourth-quarter results from rival brick-and-mortar retailers like Macy's Inc M.N, Kohl's Corp KSS.N and Best Buy Co Inc BBY.N, who have suffered the most from the market-share gains made by Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O over the past decade.  Profit margins were further eroded by a hike in employee wages in the fourth quarter. In October, the company said it would raise wages for hourly workers to $15 by 2020 and as part of that plan, will raise them to $12 per hour this spring.  In a bid to fend off rivals, Target has focused on doubling the number of its small-format stores, aggressive product promotions and keeping grocery prices low. On Tuesday, it said it will remodel 1,000 stores by 2020. Excluding items, Target earned $1.37 per share in the fourth quarter ended Feb.3, just shy of average analyst estimates for $1.38.  Gross margins stood at 26.2 percent, lower than 26.6 percent a year earlier.  Quarterly comparable sales grew 3.6 percent, beating expectations and was its strongest performance since the first quarter of 2012, thanks to higher customer traffic at both stores and online. Analysts expected a 3.1 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Sales grew 10 percent to $22.77 billion, topping the average estimate of $22.53 billion, helped by an additional week in the fourth quarter.","38":"April 19 (Reuters) - Target Corp:  * TARGET TO LAUNCH SAME-DAY DELIVERY IN COLORADO  * TARGET CORP - BEGINNING MAY 3, SHIPT WILL DELIVER FROM TARGET STORES IN BOULDER, COLORADO SPRINGS, DENVER AND FORT COLLINS METRO AREAS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","39":"Feb 12 (Reuters) - Target Corp:  * TARGET CORP - CO, SHIPT ANNOUNCE THEY WILL BEGIN SAME-DAY DELIVERY ACROSS TWIN CITIES METRO AREA  * TARGET CORP - BEGINNING MARCH 1, 2018, SHIPT WILL DELIVER FROM TARGET STORES IN AND AROUND MINNEAPOLIS AND SAINT PAUL Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","40":"April 3 (Reuters) - Target Corp:  * SHIPT AND TARGET LAUNCH SAME DAY DELIVERY ACROSS NORTHWEST Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","41":"(Reuters) - Target Corp blew past analyst expectations for quarterly profit and sales on Wednesday as more Americans used the retailer\u2019s quick-delivery services to buy everything from electronics to home goods during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Shares of the Minneapolis-based retailer hit a record high of $168.42 with a gain of about 3% in morning trading, adding to the 27% advance seen so far this year.  Comparable digital sales rose 155% in the third quarter, the company said, driven largely by same-day services like Drive up, Shipt or straight in-store pick ups, with more than 95% of sales being fulfilled through stores.  Target, which operates nearly 1,900 stores, has emerged as one of the big winners from the disruption caused by the coronavirus health crisis as investments in its private label and online business, including faster shipments, have paid off.  While people were making fewer trips outdoors, many who did venture out visited Target, raising its store traffic during the quarter. Bigger rival Walmart on Monday said it saw foot traffic fall, though U.S. e-commerce sales surged 79%.  \u201cThe investments we\u2019ve made in safety and our team are being recognized, and they\u2019re rewarding us even during the pandemic with more and more trips to our stores,\u201d said Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said on a media call.

Comparable sales, which include online and store sales, rose 20.7% in the third quarter ended Oct.31, trouncing expectations for an 11.31% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Electronics sales jumped more than 50%, while comparable sales for the home category were up in the mid-20% range.  Other categories that performed well in the quarter included home decor, intimates and sleepwear, men\u2019s apparel, food and beverage, toys, and beauty.  Earlier this month, Target said it struck a long-term deal with Ulta Beauty Inc to open the cosmetics store chain\u2019s stores at the retailer\u2019s locations.  The pandemic has forced retailers to bring forward their holiday promotions, casting a shadow over the traditional holiday shopping season from Thanksgiving to Christmas day.  \u201cWe expect this to be a season that\u2019s going to be very different, unlike any other we\u2019ve ever seen. But we expect that guests will decorate their home, and there\u2019ll be gifts under the tree,\u201d Cornell said.  Retailers that have seen sales surge during the pandemic, including Target and Walmart, are grappling with how to restock shelves quickly with highly sought essentials, especially as COVID-19 cases are surging in much of the United States and across the world, spurring Britain and other countries in Europe, and many American states, to go into another lockdown.  Target, whose inventory of cleaning and paper products had taken a hit at the start of the health crisis, said it was making progress in these categories even though sales had not returned to pre-pandemic levels. It said it felt \u201cwell positioned\u201d in all of its major categories heading into the peak of the holiday season.  Target\u2019s net earnings rose to $1.01 billion, from $714 million a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $2.79 per share, beating estimates for $1.60.

U.S. stocks opened solidly higher following better-than-expected results from retailers Target Corp and Lowe\u2019s Cos Inc.

Minneapolis-based Target employs over 300,000 workers and runs 1,845 stores in the United States. The discount chain is investing billions of dollars to improve its supply chain, grow its online sales and improve delivery of merchandise to shoppers\u2019 homes.  Target previously raised minimum hourly pay to $12 in March 2018 from $11. In 2017, Target, said it was committed to raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020. The wage increase will affect \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of employees, a Target spokeswoman said.  Retailers have been finding it tougher to attract workers, with U.S. unemployment at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, while there has been growing political pressure on companies to pay workers a fair living wage.  Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer and the largest U.S. private sector employer, pays workers $11 an hour at entry-level. Walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Amazon.com Inc raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour in October after facing harsh criticism over poor pay and working conditions. The online retailer said at the time that it would lobby Washington for the federal minimum wage to be raised.  The $15 minimum wage movement has found support from Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for the party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, part of a new crop of Democrats swept into office this year on a stronger liberal platform.  \u201cCroissants at LaGuardia (New York airport) are going for seven dollars a piece,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on April 1. \u201cYet some people think getting a whole hour of personal, dedicated human labor for $15 is too expensive??\u201d  Amid the growing political pressure, other companies have also moved to raise wages. For example, Costco Wholesale Corp raised its minimum wage twice in a year and since March pays employees at least $15 an hour.  In a blog post due to be published on Target\u2019s website on Thursday, the company\u2019s Chief Human Resources Officer Melissa Kremer tied the minimum wage hikes to the company\u2019s strong holiday performance, saying it \u201cmade a big difference.\u201d  In March, Target forecast 2019 profit above Wall Street estimates after a strong holiday season.  \u201cWe were able to start them all (seasonal hires) at $12 or more - and that helped us reach our seasonal hiring goal ahead of schedule, which gave our teams a lot of extra time to train and prepare for our busiest season of the year,\u201d Kremer said.  It was not immediately clear if Target employees who already make $13 an hour will also see an increase in pay.  Target\u2019s spokeswoman said the company would evaluate hourly pay rates for such employees and make adjustments as appropriate. With some of Target\u2019s previous wage hikes, such employees have been entitled to an annual merit raise and a pay-grade hike.

However, shares of the retailer fell nearly 3% after the company said it expects margins to drop by 5-percentage points in the first quarter due to temporary wage increases and higher sales of more low-margin products such as groceries.  The company now plans to pay an extra $2 an hour for store and distribution center workers until May 30.  Target also said it had to write down the value of its inventory for apparel and accessories as shoppers confined to their homes refrained from refreshing their wardrobe, leading to a 40% drop in comparable sales so far in April.  Target, along with Kroger KR.N and Costco COST.O, are among the few companies that have seen a net benefit in sales from consumers stockpiling essentials.  Other players in retail, especially apparel chains and department stores, have taken a big hit from the pandemic, with some of them on the verge of filing for bankruptcies.  \u201cWatching the retail industry decline is not something I enjoy, but I think going forward we\u2019re going to seesignificant market share opportunities, across our apparel business,\u201d Target Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said on a media call.  \u201cThat\u2019ll be a benefit to us.

Thursday\u2019s settlement calls for experts to review Target\u2019s guidelines for using criminal histories in hiring, and help the retailer implement appropriate changes.

The Institute for Supply Management report on the U.S. non-manufacturing sector showed companies in February placed the most new orders since August 2005, an indicator of robust health. Its measure of business activity also jumped, to 64.7 last month, versus 59.7 in January. Yields jumped as the strong data added to the chances of an interest rate hike in 2019.  The ISM report is significant \u201cbecause it is a February number. So much of the data we\u2019re getting is really old stuff,\u201d said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president, fixed income trading at D.A. Davidson, citing the U.S. government shutdown. A new home sales report also released on Tuesday reflected data for December.  For that reason, \u201cthe ISM non-manufacturing is the most important announcement\u201d of the day, said Hurley.  Yields were also higher after U.S. retailer Target forecast 2019 profit above Wall Street estimates as strong online sales and higher customer traffic at stores drove better-than-expected holiday sales, sending its shares higher, last up 4.3 percent.  Target\u2019s earnings beat helped reverse some of the pall cast over the American economy by the Commerce Department\u2019s report that December\u2019s retail sales were the weakest since 2009. The retail sales number had also been delayed by the government shutdown and was released in mid-February.  \u201cThere\u2019s some skepticism that the retail sales report that we saw for December really was as weak as it appeared because we\u2019ve seen such good earnings out of Target,\u201d said Hurley.  Analysts also mentioned that they were looking at comments from Fed members Eric Rosengren and Robert Kaplan.  Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said earlier concerns that the economy might overheat without higher interest rates now seem \u201cless pressing,\u201d with little inflation pressure and sharp market swings at the end of 2018 making investors less ebullient.  A $5.7 trillion borrowing binge by U.S. companies could make a slowdown in the world\u2019s biggest economy even more painful and is one more reason the Federal Reserve was wise to put interest rate hikes on hold, said Kaplan, president of the Dallas Fed.  The benchmark 10-year yield was last up 1.3 basis points to 2.735 percent. At both ends of the yield curve, the 30-year yield was last at 3.094 percent, up 0.3 basis point, and the two-year yield, which reflects investor expectations of future rate hikes, was up 1.4 basis points to 2.559 percent.

Target had announced the shipping service in March for shoppers who spend over $35 or use a loyalty card.  Target will also expand its Drive Up Service, where customers place orders online and have packages bought to their cars by the retailer\u2019s employees, to nearly 1,000 stores by the end of October, ahead of schedule.  Target\u2019s two-day shipping option is less expensive than Amazon.com Inc\u2019s, which requires an annual subscription fee of $119 under its Prime membership service. Walmart Inc offers free two-day shipping for a minimum order of $35.  Target will also offer same-day delivery on 55,000 items with Shipt, a company it bought for $550 million last year, to \u201chundreds of markets.\u201d Shipt currently operates in 46 states; Target did not specify how that would change, but it previously said it would offer same-day delivery to about two-thirds of U.S. households by the holiday season.  The biggest changes the retailer has made to its business over the past five years have been on order fulfillment, the final mile of delivering orders from a warehouse or store to shopper\u2019s homes, Target Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell told reporters during a press briefing on Tuesday.  The offerings will be part of the \u201cTarget Run and Done\u201d promotional campaign during the holidays.  Cornell also said Target\u2019s holiday hiring plans are on schedule. The retailer has received over 100,000 applications in a tight labor market and is seeing a 40 percent lift in job applications for its warehouses. In September, Target had said it would hire 120,000 seasonal workers at wages starting at $12 an hour. The company has made a commitment to going up to $15 an hour by 2020.  Last week, Target said it will dedicate nearly a quarter of a million square feet of new space to its toy business across 500 stores, seeking more holiday toy sales after retailer Toys \u201cR\u201d Us Inc went bankrupt this year. Target had said its shoppers will be able to shop for more than 2,500 new and exclusive toys. Rival, Walmart Inc has made a similar push for gaining market share in toys. In August, Target reported its strongest comparable store sales growth in 13 years and said a strong economy lifted customer visits to the most in a decade.  U.S. holiday sales in 2018 will up 4.3 percent to 4.8 percent from a year ago when consumer spending surged to a 12-year high, according to The National Retail Federation (NRF).  The trade body said holiday sales growth will be higher than an average increase of 3.9 percent over the past five years but slower than last year\u2019s 5.3 percent growth, when consumer spending grew the most since 2005, boosted by tax cuts. (Reporting by Nandita Bose in New York; Editing by David Gregorio)","54":"Aug 19 (Reuters) - Target Corp on Wednesday reported its best quarterly comparable sales growth and online revenue that nearly tripled as shoppers lapped up videogames, kitchenware and clothes during the pandemic using the retailer\u2019s same-day delivery services.  The surging demand seen at big-box chains at the height of the lockdown, has continued into the second quarter even as restrictions ease, with shoppers using their stimulus checks to shop for non-essentials, such as tablets and beauty products.  \u201cThe biggest change we saw from Q1 to Q2 ... was the exceptional growth we saw in in-store shopping in an environment where many Americans were turning to digital to fulfill their needs,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell told reporters.  In the second quarter ended Aug. 1, the U.S. retailer\u2019s apparel sales grew by double-digits compared to a 20% decline in the first quarter, with electronics sales up more than 70%.  Through the pandemic-ridden first half of the year, that saw numerous bankruptcies of traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, Target said it grabbed about $5 billion in market share across categories.  The retailer also echoed bigger rival Walmart in describing the start to the back-to-school season as slow because of uncertainty around when students would go back to classrooms.  \u201cAs we move into Q4 we can expect a hard fought election and a holiday season that like so much of this year, is likely to be unprecedented,\u201d Cornell said.  The company\u2019s comparable sales, which include online and store sales, jumped 24.3% in the quarter trouncing expectations of a 8.2% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Comparable digital sales surged 195%, driven largely by the success of Target\u2019s same-day services, such as in-store pick up, Drive up, and Shipt, which grew 273% in the quarter.  Target\u2019s net earnings rose to $1.69 billion from $938 million a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $3.38 per share.  Total revenue rose 24.7% to $22.98 billion.","55":"March 15 (Reuters) - Target Corp:  * TARGET CORPORATION DECLARES REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND  * SETS QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.62 PER SHARE Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","56":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of GAP clothing retailer is seen at a company's store at Tbilisi Mall in Tbilisi, Georgia, April 22, 2016. REUTERS\/David Mdzinarishvili  (Reuters) - Gap Inc GPS.N said on Thursday it plans to hire more than 30,000 seasonal workers for the upcoming holiday season, lower than the 65,000 target the apparel retailer had set for 2018.  The holiday season, which includes Black Friday, Christmas and New Year, is the busiest time of the year for retailers and brings in a majority of their total sales.  A Gap spokeswoman said total seasonal hiring is lower this year to give current employees the opportunity to pick up more hours.  Hiring plans often indicate sales expectations of retailers and come against the backdrop of a softening retail environment and a prolonged U.S.-China trade war that has threatened to increase costs for retailers.  Big-box retailer Target Corp TGT.N said earlier this month that it planned to hire more than 130,000 store employees for the holiday season, a roughly 8% rise from last year, but much lower than the 20% increase in 2018 and a 43% jump in 2017.  Retail jobs contracted for a seventh straight month in August to hit their lowest since January 2016, which hinted at softer U.S. consumer spending going into the Christmas season.  Gap said on Thursday it would host a one-day event on Oct. 5 at all its stores, as well as select distribution and customer centers across the United States and Canada to hire as many as 5,000 work associates as part of the holiday hiring plan.  Shares of the company were down about 2% in afternoon trading.","57":"April 10 (Reuters) - Target Corp:  * SHIPT AND TARGET TO LAUNCH SAME-DAY DELIVERY ACROSS NEVADA  * BEGINNING APRIL 26, SHIPT WILL DELIVER FROM TARGET STORES IN LAS VEGAS AND RENO, INCLUDING SURROUNDING METRO AREAS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","58":"(Reuters) - From Georgia to Wisconsin to Ohio earlier this year, voters in primary elections were stuck for hours in lines from sharply reduced polling locations. And the surge in absentee ballots due to concerns over the coronavirus pandemic overwhelmed election officials.  Heeding the stark warning ahead of Election Day on Nov. 3, U.S. companies are aiming to facilitate what is expected to be a chaotic 2020 U.S. presidential election. Twitter TWTR.N and Apple AAPL.O are giving workers paid time off to get to ballot boxes. Starbucks SBUX.O and The Gap's GPS.N Old Navy are urging staff to volunteer at local polling stations.  Nearly 800 companies including Nike NKE.N, healthcare company Abbott Laboratories ABT.N and technology company Qualcomm QCOM.O are participating in a CEO-led bipartisan activist group called Time to Vote, which encourages companies to give employees at least a few hours off to vote.  Starbucks Chief Executive Kevin Johnson said last month that people could work out with managers when they can head to polls, adding that the move is partly motivated by concerns about Black voter suppression. Starbucks is also urging its over 200,000 U.S. employees register to vote from its mobile app.  \u201cWe know that barriers exist, notably in Black and Brown communities throughout the nation, that lend to systemic racism and require greater voter access and protections,\u201d Johnson said in an internal memo on Aug. 27. \u201cNo (employee) will have to choose between working their shift or voting on or before Election Day.\u201d  Rules securing time off for workers to vote vary by state. In New York, workers can be paid for up to two hours to vote, but they may be required to give advance notice. In Alabama, workers get one hour of unpaid time.  \u201cVoting is always important, but the degree of partisan polarization this year seems to be extraordinarily high. This makes the stakes of the election unusually high as well,\u201d said Jonathan Entin, professor of political science at Case Western Reserve University.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Partisan battles over expanding mail-in voting amid the pandemic have threatened to snarl the political process where more than a third of registered voters are expected to do so by mail or vote early in person, according to a survey published in August from Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape project.  President Donald Trump for months has railed against voting by mail citing unfounded fraud concerns and last week encouraged supporters to vote twice, once by mail and again in person, compounding the confusion ahead of Election Day.  Nearly half of voters fear difficulties with voting in the U.S. presidential elections, according to a voter survey by Pew Research.  Companies including Tiffany & Co TIF.N, Levi Strauss LEVI.N and Walmart WMT.N have offered paid time off or flexible hours to workers.  \u201cIf any employee needs extra time to vote or work at the polls, they can simply work with their managers on creating a flexible schedule,\u201d a spokesman for packaged food company Conagra Brands CAG.N said.  Some companies, including Kraft Heinz KHC.O and Target TGT.N, have also set up websites to guide employees on registering to vote and learning about candidates in partnership with the League of Women Voters and the National Association of Manufacturers.  Several states have warned in recent months that they may not have enough poll workers, with Maryland at one point estimating it was short 14,000 people. In response, companies including Target and The Gap have offered paid time off to volunteer as poll workers. Poll sites are expected to fall short of volunteers as older people who are more at risk to COVID-19 infection have typically staffed sites and are expected to stay home.  The two companies have joined 150 others including Amazon.com AMZN.O and Etsy ETSY.O to help sign up 350,000 new volunteers through a corporate-led campaign called the Civic Alliance. The group says on its website that its goal is to drive historic voter turnout in 2020.

Similar scenes were seen in the United Kingdom, where consumers have stripped shelves bare of canned food, disinfectants, toilet paper and other essentials with the country going into lockdown.  UK's biggest retailer Tesco TSCO.L said the coronavirus-led panic buying has put the company in \"uncharted waters,\" while Ocado, UK's top online grocer, said on Tuesday orders currently were 10 times normal rates. The biggest global names are cautious in admitting it, but after a decade of an e-commerce induced \"retail apocalypse\", the coronavirus outbreak is providing the relief that big-box supermarket operators have been hoping for.  Analysts pointed to Walmart and Target as two chains that will benefit more than others in the United States due to their robust supply chains and higher investments in online and delivery.  \u201cWalmart and Target\u2019s curbside pick up and delivery capabilities will resonate strongly with consumers in this time of social distancing, and should contribute comparable sales growth,\u201d Cowen analyst Oliver Chen said in a note early this month.  The virus, which has infected more than 44,000 people in the United States leading to more than 500 deaths, has resulted in the closure of several businesses and raised concerns of a global recession.  Target said on Wednesday it would focus on meeting this surging demand by cutting down on remodelling stores and opening fewer small format outlets.  The company also withdrew its full-year outlook that it had announced just three weeks earlier, and suspended its $5 billion share buyback program.  Shares of Target fell as much as 8.7% to $91.80. They have fallen nearly 22% this year.  Target CEO Cornell said demand has been \u201cunprecedented,\u201d likening the buying behavior to levels occasionally seen during natural disasters.  \u201cThere is no playbook for how to react in this environment.

The reports come on the heels of solid Walmart Inc earnings and retail sales data last week that allayed fears of a U.S. recession.  Big-box retailer Target Corp surged 18.2%, the most on the S&P 500 index, after it beat quarterly profit estimates and raised its annual earnings forecast.

The Minneapolis-based retailer also raised its annual profit forecast and said its quarterly performance was driven by demand for home products, toys and electronics as well as a rebound in seasonal merchandise sales after cold weather in the first quarter hurt demand.  An extra week of back-to-school spending in the second quarter versus a year earlier along with a one-day sale in July to compete with Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O Prime Day, also boosted performance.  Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said the jump in customer traffic during the second quarter was unprecedented. Store traffic grew 6.4 percent from a 2.1 percent gain during the same period a year earlier.  \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that like others, we\u2019re currently benefiting from a very strong consumer environment, perhaps the strongest I\u2019ve seen in my career,\u201d he said.

Cornell said its performance was aided by investments in its online operations, bulking up its lineup of in-house brands, rolling out smaller stores, a supply chain overhaul, store remodeling and delivery options.  Online sales jumped 41 percent in the quarter, versus a 28 percent gain in the first quarter and a 32 percent rise a year ago after Target cut its next-day delivery fee for household items to $2.99 from $4.99 and rolled out a drive-up service to pick up orders in an hour.  Target is also expanding its delivery services through Shipt, a same-day delivery company it bought for $550 million last year, and partnering with courier services on same-day orders in U.S. metro areas. The retailer said it will offer same-day delivery to about two-thirds of U.S. households by the holiday season.  Target plans to make capital expenditure of $3 billion this year on its supply chain, online delivery, its own brands and merging online and in-store shopping. The retailer intends to reinvest more than $7 billion through 2020.  The retailer will try to grab more toy sales during the second half. \u201cWe are going to make sure we are taking more than our fair share of that market,\u201d Cornell said referring to the toy and baby categories. Retailer Toys \u201cR\u201d Us Inc went bankrupt earlier this year.  Second-quarter same-store sales rose 4.9 percent, topping analysts\u2019 expectations of a 3.99 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Excluding one-time items, Target earned $1.47 per share in the quarter ended Aug. 4, higher than the average analyst estimate of $1.40.  Margins remained under pressure from investments in e-commerce. The gross margin rate was 30.3 percent, compared with 30.4 percent a year ago.  Revenue rose to $17.78 billion, topping the average estimate of $17.31 billion.  For the full year, Target raised its earnings forecast to a range of $5.30 to $5.50 per share from $5.15 to $5.45.  The retailer\u2019s shares rose as much as 6.8 percent to $88.89, the highest since at least 1980, and were up 5.2 percent at $87.59 at midmorning.

The Minneapolis-based chain\u2019s expansion of delivery and in-store pick-ups, along with a broadening of product lines, has made it a success story among U.S. brick-and-mortar retailers striving to deal with the shift to online shopping.  Sales growth in the crucial November-December period, however, came in at just 1.4%, down from 5.7% growth a year ago and compared to the company\u2019s own previous forecasts of around 3-4% for the whole of the fourth quarter.

Kohl's KSS.N, J.C. Penney JCP.N and Macy's M.N all reported a drop in sales for the holiday period last week as foot traffic in malls dropped.  One standout so far has been membership-only supermarket chain Costco COST.O, which recorded a 9% rise in comparable store sales for the 18 weeks ended Jan. 5.  \u201cTarget missed expectations because web growth didn\u2019t outpace the industry and its online sales in general are lower than the percent that other retailers see from ecommerce,\u201d said Sucharita Kodali, retail analyst at Forrester Research.

Target expects same-store sales growth of about 5 percent for the fourth quarter through January, while comparable sales had grown 3.4 percent in the November-December period last year.  All of the retailer\u2019s core categories grew during the holiday season, with toys, baby and seasonal gift items being the strongest.

The robust sales numbers indicate consumer confidence has largely not been impacted by rising market volatility due to concerns over slowing global growth and a political deadlock in Washington.  Target said store pickup and drive-up surged more than 60 percent from a year ago, and accounted for a quarter of the company\u2019s digital sales in the holiday period.

Covid-19 has given many businesses a beating, but not vegan egg maker Just. The company says it\u2019s likely to pursue an initial public offering earlier than planned, Reuters reported on Wednesday, after sales grew 150% from April to June, year-over-year. Scrambling the recent trend for loss-making IPOs, Just wants an operating profit before it hits the public market.  Even without a pandemic, vegan food was a hot investment category. Shares of Beyond Meat are up more than 80% since its IPO last year. True, bean-based ovo-substitutes are a tougher sell. But the total addressable market, a staple data point for hotshot IPOs, is huge. Around 1.4 trillion chicken eggs are consumed annually, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization.  Aiming to turn an operating profit before going public \u2013 which Beyond Meat did not \u2013 is wise, if only because Just\u2019s history is complex.

U.S. chain Target\u2019s shares shot up more than 12% on Wednesday after its second-quarter revenue grew by one-quarter. More impressive is that about 17% of sales came from online orders, more than doubling from just over 7% in the same period last year. That switch didn\u2019t impact its operating profit margin either, since the higher cost of delivery was offset by fewer discounts and cost cuts elsewhere.  The reason is that Target started early. The company bought same-day delivery platform Shipt in 2017 for $550 million and has tacked on in-store and drive-by delivery too. A retailer building e-commerce from scratch would struggle to process the equivalent of 10% of its pre-pandemic sales through digital channels at short notice. That also meant that Target\u2019s 195% growth in e-commerce revenue outpaced even giant rival Walmart, whose digital sales almost doubled over the same period. Self-help pays off.

Since Covid-19 went global in March, public health has largely taken precedence over economic concerns. That\u2019s still the case in New Zealand, but in Britain, a shift is visible. The government now hopes that airport tests can replace quarantines for travellers from some countries. A change will please airlines like Ryanair and easyJet, whose reopening plans have been thrown into disarray.  The UK government\u2019s thinking seems to be that European Covid-related deaths are not rising as fast as cases, and improved tests and more effective tracing can keep the situation under control until vaccines start arriving, hopefully early next year. If that attitude spreads, Germany\u2019s expected extension of its pandemic furlough scheme to 24 months will look excessive. A surge in Covid-19 hospitalisations would lead to a fast U-turn, but if that doesn\u2019t happen, governments may be less cautious about pushing harder for an economic take-off.

UK inflation accelerated to 1% in July from 0.6% in June, official data showed on Wednesday. The reading was above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. It mirrored the bigger-than-expected rise in U.S. consumer prices reported on Aug. 12.  Gathering data, a big problem during strict lockdown, is now straightforward. And petrol prices, which boosted inflation on both sides of the Atlantic, are easy enough to track. But the pandemic has disrupted consumer and retail behaviour. In Britain, clothing and footwear prices were the biggest contributors to the rise in the inflation rate because the normal summer discounting was brought forward to the lockdown months. Still, the upside inflation surprises don\u2019t change the big picture. At current levels of activity, high and sustained inflation is some way off.

The company said it had underpaid employees at its Target business by A$9 million ($6.02 million).

Wesfarmers shares touched an intraday high of A$46.94 to close up 2.9%, their biggest gain in a year.  Several high-profile Australian companies have been embroiled in wages scandals, setting aside millions of dollars to repay affected employees.

Revenue from continuing operations for the half-year rose 6% to A$15.25 billion and the company cut its interim dividend to 75 cents per share for the period from 100 cents a year earlier.

Walmart said it removed the toys from its shelves and online as soon as LaRose informed the recall nearly three years ago and it did not sell the products thereafter.  \u201cWe\u2019ve discussed this matter with the New York Attorney General\u2019s office and will address the allegations and demands with the court,\u201d a Walmart spokesman said.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  (Reuters) - Target Corp TGT.N should hold off on plans to cash in on a perceived advantage in toys after the collapse of Toys \"R\" Us, several of the company's investors told Reuters, worried it could eat up capital desperately needed in an Amazon-dominated retail world.  When the biggest toy retailer in the U.S. went bankrupt last September, analysts parsing through the wreckage came to the conclusion that Target would be among the biggest beneficiaries.  Of the 182 Toys \u201cR\u201d Us stores scheduled to close in the first half of 2018, 93 percent are within a 15-minute drive of at least one Target store, UBS analyst Arpine Kocharyan said and analysts say the department-store chain should see more traffic as a result.  The Minneapolis-based company was already in the middle of a push that saw it add 1,400 new toys to its catalog in 2017 and Wall Street brokerages say it could see a 30-45 basis point jump in overall group sales as a consequence of the bankruptcy.  \u201cWe are playing to win in toys. We think there is opportunity to expand share,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said on a conference call last November.  Target has also launched a number of exclusive toys including a board game based on Bob Ross's Joy of Painting TV show and introduced a line of action figures based on characters from Netflix's NFLX.O smash hit \"Stranger Things\".  The investors who spoke to Reuters in the past month were not convinced.  \u201cWe do not believe Target should invest more in selling national brand toys, and Target\u2019s toys business is not core to our investment thesis,\u201d said Jack Leslie, a portfolio manager for Miller\/Howard Investments Portfolio, who holds a $96 million stake in Target.  HEAD ON FIGHT  Target declined to say how much it is spending on toy advertising and repositioning itself, but the company did lay out plans last year to spend $2 billion on promotions, stores and technology to fight other retailers head on.  UBS\u2019s Kocharyan estimated the company could get a 0.4-0.45 percent boost in revenue even if it only managed to capture 25 percent of the sales lost by Toys \u201cR\u201d Us.  Target\u2019s stock, down over 10 percent in 2017, has recovered those losses to trade up 11.7 percent this year.  Yet the picture is cloudy and complicated by the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us restructuring and the underlying factors behind its bankruptcy.  The toy chain collapsed mainly by its inability to service a huge debt load piled on it by its private equity buyers, KKR & Co LP KKR.N and Bain Capital LP, amid tepid sales and a broader shift toward online shopping.  Sector analysts are unsure how long it will take Toys \u201cR\u201d Us to emerge from bankruptcy.  If Target wants to get, and as importantly, keep the customers Toys \u201cR\u201d Us lost, then it will need to invest solidly in marketing itself as a major toy retailer.  At the same time there is the Amazon factor that continues to upend the traditional retailing industry everyday.  \u201cThe toy category is not a growth category,\u201d said Steven Roorda, an analyst and portfolio manager with Minnesota-based Stonebridge Capital Advisors, who has covered Target for 30 years and owns shares of the company.  \u201cU.S. birth rates are moderating and along with children using other devices to access entertainment at an earlier age (that) means that the toy category has been under pressure as evidenced by what is going on with (toymaker) Mattel.\u201d  Four of the institutional investors who Reuters spoke to said they would rather see Target focus on exclusive private-label brands, expanding its online business and open more stores next to urban campuses to make it \u201cun-Amazonable\u201d.  \u201cIs Target going to improve its business, improve its traffic and will there be a halo effect from selling more toys. I think the answer is yes, yes and yes,\u201d said John Tompkins, a portfolio manager at Tyvor Capital, which owns more than 300,000 shares in the retailer.  \u201cWould I raise my stake specifically related to this because I think their toy business is going to get better, no.\u201d","90":"March 15 (Reuters) - Target Corp:  * SHIPT AND TARGET TO LAUNCH SAME-DAY DELIVERY IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

REUTERS\/Jeenah Moon  Target's sales figures and tepid forecast underscore the pressure brick-and-mortar retailers are facing in building their e-commerce operations to attract more shoppers amid fierce competition from Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.  Its comparable digital sales rose 20% in the fourth quarter, compared with 31% growth in the previous quarter as well as in the same period a year earlier.  Walmart Inc WMT.N last month posted its slowest increase in quarterly online sales in nearly two years and forecast growth to slow further this year. In contrast, Amazon logged record sales for the holiday season.  High online growth rates at Target and Walmart would be difficult as the businesses grow larger in scale and as Amazon eats into their pie, especially during the holiday quarter, Ken Perkins, founder of research firm Retail Metrics, said.  Kohl's Corp KSS.N, in contrast, beat tempered expectations for holiday-quarter sales as a partnership with Amazon brought in more shoppers to its stores.  The slowdown in growth for Target, one of the bellwethers in the retail industry, comes even as it spends billions of dollars to roll out same-day delivery and in-store pickup services, while remodeling stores to use as hubs for online orders.  Total revenue rose 1.8% to $23.40 billion, but missed expectations of $23.50 billion. Analysts had lowered their estimates from $23.90 billion after Target reported weak sales in January for the crucial shopping season.  However, its adjusted profit of $1.69 per share beat estimates of $1.66, as the company saved on delivery costs with more customers picking up their online orders from stores.  Target forecast adjusted earnings of $6.70 to $7 per share for fiscal 2020, the mid-point of which was below analysts\u2019 estimates of $6.87, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

FILE PHOTO: A newly constructed Target store is shown in San Diego, California May 17, 2016. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Minneapolis-based Target, the eight largest U.S. retailer by sales and fifth largest by employee count, runs 1,845 stores and employs more than 300,000 workers in the United States. The discount chain is investing billions of dollars to improve its supply chain, expand online sales and improve delivery of merchandise to shoppers\u2019 homes.  Target previously raised minimum hourly pay to $12 in March 2018 from $11. In 2017, Target, said it was committed to raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour by end of 2020. The wage increase will affect \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of employees, a Target spokeswoman said.  Retailers have been finding it tougher to attract workers, with U.S. unemployment at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, while there has been growing political pressure on companies to pay workers a fair living wage.  Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer and the largest U.S. private sector employer, pays entry-level workers $11 an hour. Walmart declined comment on the issue. The retailer\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon, said in February that a Walmart worker earns $17.55 on average with wages and benefits. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable that we\u2019ve got the appropriate wage investments to get the talent we need,\u201d he said.  Amazon.com Inc raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour in October after facing harsh criticism over poor pay and working conditions. The online retailer said at the time that it would lobby Washington for an increase in the federal minimum wage.  The $15 minimum wage movement has found support from Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for the party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, part of a new crop of Democrats swept into office this year on a liberal platform.  \u201cCroissants at LaGuardia (New York airport) are going for seven dollars a piece,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on April 1. \u201cYet some people think getting a whole hour of personal, dedicated human labor for $15 is too expensive??\u201d  Amid the growing political pressure, other companies have also moved to raise wages. For example, Costco Wholesale Corp raised its minimum wage twice in a year and since March has been paying employees at least $15 an hour.  In a blog post due to be published on Target\u2019s website on Thursday, the company\u2019s chief human resources officer, Melissa Kremer, tied the minimum wage hikes to the company\u2019s strong holiday performance, saying it \u201cmade a big difference.\u201d  In March, Target forecast 2019 profit above Wall Street estimates after a strong holiday season.  \u201cWe were able to start them all (seasonal hires) at $12 or more - and that helped us reach our seasonal hiring goal ahead of schedule, which gave our teams a lot of extra time to train and prepare for our busiest season of the year,\u201d Kremer said.  It was not immediately clear if Target employees who already make $13 an hour will also see an increase in pay.  Target\u2019s spokeswoman said the company would evaluate hourly pay rates for such employees and make adjustments as appropriate. With some of Target\u2019s previous wage hikes, such employees have been entitled to an annual merit raise and a pay-grade hike.","96":"March 6 (Reuters) - Target Corp:  * CEO - NEIGHBORHOOD STORES FULFILLED MORE THAN HALF OF OUR TOTAL DIGITAL VOLUME - CONF CALL  * CEO - RAISING STARTING WAGE TO $12 AN HOUR THIS SPRING - CONF CALL  * CEO - EXPECTS 325 MORE STORES TO BE REMODELED IN 2018 - CONF CALL  * CEO - TO OFFER FREE TWO DAY DELIVER ON \u201cHUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ITEMS\u201d ON WEBSITE - CONF CALL  * CEO - CO TO EXPAND SAME-DAY DELIVERY SERVICE FROM MANHATTAN TO ALL 5 BOROUGHS AND SEVERAL OTHER BIG-CITY MARKETS  * STORES WILL BE OUR PREFERRED SHIPPING POINT OF DIGITAL ORDERS IN THE LONG RUN - CONF CALL  * TO RAISE CAPITAL INVESTMENT TO OVER $3 BILLION IN 2018 - CONF CALL  * THE YEAR\u2019S EXPECTED DECLINE IN OPERATING MARGIN RATE WILL BE DRIVEN ENTIRELY BY $175 MILLION INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION & AMORTIZATION Further company coverage:","97":"(Reuters) - Target Corp on Thursday expanded its same-day delivery options for online shoppers, intensifying the race among retailers to deliver orders faster.

Target expects to deliver a strong holiday performance by expanding its toy department in more than 500 stores, offering two-day free shipping with no minimum purchases on thousands of items and accelerating the pace of store remodels, he said.  Target expects same-store sales to rise about 5 percent in the final quarter, signaling a slowdown during the most critical time of the year for retailers even though it was above estimates of 4.8 percent.

But operating income continues to reflect near-term challenges, Chief Executive Brian Cornell said on an earnings conference call.  The retailer remained confident it could hit its earlier full-year earnings outlook, however, with payoff from investments aimed at warding off competition from Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and brick-and-mortar rivals expected to pick up later this year.  \u201cThe key message from Target\u2019s first-quarter results was the company\u2019s ability to drive transaction growth, but not without investment spending and margin pressures,\u201d Morningstar analysts wrote in a research note.  Target\u2019s operating income margin weakened to 6.2 percent in the first quarter from 7.1 percent a year ago.  The retailer said margins should improve as seasonal merchandise sales rebound after a delayed spring, pricing investments made last year deliver results, customers react positively to new private-label brands and it focuses on cost-cutting.  Morningstar expects online sales, higher costs associated with delivery and price competition will continue to weigh, however, and did not anticipate a sizeable change to its 5.9 percent average operating margin projection over the next decade.  The retailer has poured billions of dollars into aggressively promoting its products, remodeling stores and keeping grocery prices low to compete with Walmart and supermarket chain Kroger Co KR.N.  It cut its next-day delivery fee for household essentials to $2.99 from $4.99 last week and waived it for customers paying with a Target card.  The retailer said on Wednesday it is rolling out a new drive-up service where shoppers can pick up orders in an hour.  It is also expanding its delivery services through Shipt, a same-day delivery company it bought for $550 million last year, and partnering with courier services on same-day orders in metro areas.  Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods rattled the grocery industry on worries the online seller would quickly ramp up delivery of fresh food.  Last week, Whole Foods debuted a loyalty program for Amazon Prime customers and Kroger said it would partner with British online grocer Ocado OCDO.L to build robot-operated warehouses to support U.S. home delivery.  Target has said it plans $3 billion of capital expenditure this year on its supply chain, online delivery, its own brands and merging online and in-store shopping.  The retailer maintained its full-year forecast of a low to single digit increase in comparable sales and adjusted earnings of $5.15 to $5.45 per share.  Target shares, which tumbled more than 8 percent in pre-market trade, were last down 5.4 percent at $71.37.

In February last year, Target said it would reinvest more than $7 billion through 2020. Cornell said shoppers are reacting positively to remodeled stores, investments in merchandising and speedy delivery.  Strong sales growth in home, essentials, food and beverages, offset weaker sales in weather-sensitive categories.  Online sales rose 28 percent in the first quarter, up from a 21 percent rise a year ago but below the 29 percent rise in the fourth quarter.  Excluding items, Minneapolis-based Target earned a profit of$1.32 per share in the quarter ended May 5, below the average analyst estimate of $1.39.

Macy\u2019s Inc said on Wednesday it would hire 80,000 temporary workers for the holiday season, in line with last year\u2019s initial hiring, and assign more hands to cater to online orders.  Minneapolis-based Target, which began raising hourly wages to $12 from $11 earlier this year, said all workers hired after Sept. 16 would receive a minimum of $12 an hour.  Last year, the company vowed to pay $15 an hour by the end of 2020, the so-called \u201cliving wage\u201d for which labor advocates across the United States are campaigning.  Target also said it was investing more than $2 million in an employee rewards program during the holiday season.","107":"Jan 15 (Reuters) - Target Corp on Wednesday reported comparable sales growth of just 1.4% for the 2019 holiday season on the back of weak demand for electronics, toys and home products, sending shares in the retailer 8% lower.  \u201cWe faced challenges throughout November and December in key seasonal merchandise categories and our holiday sales did not meet our expectations,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said in a statement.  Last week, mall-based chains Kohl\u2019s, J.C. Penney and Macy\u2019s said sales fell during the November-December period.","108":"A newly constructed Target store is shown in San Diego, California May 17, 2016.

Coffee futures are currently trading near 13-year lows, weighed down by a record-large Brazilian crop. Prices are below the cost of production in most countries, forcing some farmers out of business and prompting concern from the industry on its long-term ability to source good coffee.  Archer Farms, Target\u2019s flagship-owned coffee brand, sells about six million pounds of coffee each year. Currently, about 20 percent of Archer Farms coffee is fair trade certified.  The United States imported about 3.5 billion pounds of coffee in the 2018\/2019 season, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  Fair Trade USA, the leading certifier of such products in North America, works to institute a floor price for farmers; for coffee, that minimum price is $1.40 per pound and farmers receive an additional 20 cents per pound sold.  \u201cThe current market is nothing short of a disaster for coffee farmers,\u201d said Paul Rice, founder and CEO of Fair Trade USA.  The most active coffee futures contract fell last week to 94.65 cents per pound, the lowest since 2005. Farmers have been searching for ways to find pricing alternatives, including separate pricing mechanisms for high-grade specialty beans.","109":"FILE PHOTO: Employees work at a Target store at St. Albert, Alberta, January 15, 2015. REUTERS\/Dan Riedlhuber\/Files  (Reuters) - Target Corp on Sunday said it was unable to process select card payments at some stores for nearly 90 minutes due to a vendor-related issue \u2013 the second consecutive outage faced by the retailer in a week.  Target said its payments vendor NCR experienced an issue at one of its data centers on Sunday afternoon, which affected the retailer\u2019s stores.  The incident was not related to Saturday\u2019s glitch, the company said in an emailed statement, adding that the issue has now been resolved and payments are going through.  The company had faced an outage on Saturday due to an \u201cinternal technology issue\u201d which stopped customers in the United States from paying for in-store purchases.  The issue was not a security-related issue and no payment information was compromised at any time, the retailer added.  A defect in a network device in June 2014 also caused problems with Target\u2019s payment processing systems, according to media reports.","110":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of world stock markets recovered from early declines but was slightly lower on Tuesday as China cut its growth targets to a 30-year low but added more stimulus, while strong U.S. economic data sent the dollar to a two-week high.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Stocks on Wall Street traded in a like fashion, with the benchmark S&P 500 a touch below the unchanged mark as investors looked for developments on trade between the United States and China. Positive retail earnings from Target Corp and data on the U.S. services and housing sectors helped provide support to the upside.  The Commerce Department said sales of new U.S. single-family homes rose to a seven-month high in December while a reading from the Institute for Supply Management showed an acceleration in growth in the vast services sector in February.  The S&P 500 index has struggled to hold above the 2,800 level, which has proven to be a stiff resistant point. Still, the index is up nearly 19 percent from its Dec. 24 low.  \u201cWhen you are here at that important level in the S&P 500, it\u2019s healthier to see the market slow down, pause, take account of the micro and the macro and absorb the good news,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.  \u201cTo see the market pause right now, as opposed to a deep sell-off, is encouraging.\u201d  European shares bounced between modest gains and declines, eventually closing slightly higher in the wake of China\u2019s response to the lowered growth target of between 6.0 to 6.5 percent for 2019, which includes billions of dollars in planned tax cuts and infrastructure spending and a lack of news on the trade front.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 13.02 points, or 0.05 percent, to 25,806.63, the S&P 500 lost 3.16 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,789.65 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.21 points, or 0.02 percent, to 7,576.36.  Fatigue after a strong run higher for equities is playing a role in the recent pause. MSCI\u2019s All Country World Index was down 0.07 percent, and has now risen more than 15 percent from its near two-year closing low on Dec. 24. The index is trading at 14.6 times expected earnings, on par with levels back in early October, when a global bear market began to take hold.

The holiday season, which includes Black Friday, Christmas and New Year shopping, marks the busiest time for retailers and records the most sales during the year.  \u201cIt\u2019s critical we build the right team across our stores and supply chain to deliver an exceptional holiday experience for our guests during the busiest time of the year,\u201d Chief Human Resources Officer Melissa Kremer said.  The seasonal hiring would include about 125,000 employees in stores and 8,000 at its distribution and fulfillment centers in the United States.  Big-box retailers have been investing more on their websites and mobile apps as consumers prefer to shop online and have it delivered to their doorstep or pick up in stores, rather than wait in long lines at billing counters.  Target is the one of the first retailers to layout its hiring plans for the holidays. The 8% rise in holiday hiring is much lower than last year\u2019s 20% increase.  United Parcel Service Inc, the world\u2019s biggest parcel delivery firm, said on Monday it was planning to hire 100,000 holiday workers, the same number as last year, hinting at a softening in the U.S. consumer economy.  Retail employment contracted for a seventh straight month in August to hit the lowest level since January 2016. Department store jobs, which have been hard hit by online competition, sunk to the lowest point since the federal government started tracking the data in 1990.  Target said it would pay workers $13 for an hour, a wage that it has been paying employees since June. The company will also invest $2 million in an employee rewards program for the holidays.

Target did not give any reason for the outage and was not immediately reachable for comment.

The company spent about $500 million in the first quarter ended May 2 to maintain safety measures at stores and to pay employees higher wages for working through the pandemic.  \u201cLast quarter was unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Chief Executive Brian Cornell told reporters. \u201cIt was intense, it was volatile, it was stressful for guests and the country.\u201d  Stay-at-home orders imposed to contain the virus powered a 141% jump in Target\u2019s online comparable sales, accounting for almost all of its same-store sales growth.  Although sales at stores opened for at least a year rose 0.9%, including digital they jumped 10.8%, beating Wall Street estimates of a 7.49% rise, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  At the start of the quarter, Target, like Walmart, benefited from customers stockpiling staples and cleaning products, but as the lockdown extended and the stimulus checks arrived, demand rose for discretionary items including apparel.  Target, which has already pulled its financial targets for the year, said it would scale back planned investments to focus on meeting increased demand.  \u201cThere\u2019s just so much uncertainty as I think about the balance of the year ... Obviously we\u2019re watching closely to see what happens from an economic standpoint,\u201d Cornell said.  The company\u2019s net earnings fell to $284 million from $795 million, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 59 cents per share.  Revenue rose 11.3% to $19.37 billion, edging past expectations of $19.04 billion.
