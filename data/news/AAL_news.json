Investors can exchange the bonds for others also coming due in 2020, but with a $50 bonus per $1,000.  United Airlines and Kingsland Holdings Limited, which between them control Avianca, said in a joint statement that results of the exchange thus far were sufficient for it to give the airline up to $250 million in additional financing.  \u201cWe are also pleased to confirm that this achievement is sufficient to satisfy United\u2019s requirement for the exchange of these May 2020 bonds, regarding our previously announced offer, together with Kingsland, to loan $250 million to Avianca Holdings,\u201d said John Gebo, senior vice president of alliances for United Airlines.  \u201cOur loan remains contingent on certain other conditions being met by Avianca Holdings, including certain commitments and waivers made by other stakeholders,\u201d Gebo said.

The surprise deal with Latin America\u2019s largest carrier will give Delta a much bigger footprint in the region, a key growth market in which LATAM flies to dozens of destinations including cities in Argentina, Peru and Brazil.  The LATAM deal is Delta\u2019s largest since it merged with Northwest Airlines a decade ago.  American Airlines Group Inc, which has long been the leading U.S. carrier in the region and was pursuing a deeper route alliance with LATAM, said the loss of its Chilean partner would not have a significant impact on its financial results.  American added that its LATAM partnership had limited upside after the Chilean Supreme Court struck down the two carriers\u2019 plans for further route cooperation that would have also involved oneworld alliance members British Airways and Iberia.  \u201cThis is a body blow for American, but not a lethal body blow. It means that Delta will have more access to Latin America than it did before, but American already has much of that in its back pocket,\u201d independent aviation analyst Mike Boyd said.  Following its tie-up with Delta, LATAM will exit oneworld and pursue route options with Delta and its partner Grupo Aeromexico, which belong to the rival SkyTeam alliance. It has not, however, decided whether to officially join SkyTeam.  Oneworld said LATAM had advised it would leave the alliance in \u201cdue course\u201d in line with contractual requirements, without naming a specific date.  Airlines increasingly have bilateral codeshare arrangements outside major alliances. Qantas Airways Ltd, a oneworld member, said it would retain its codeshare partnership with LATAM despite the Chilean carrier\u2019s departure from the alliance.  DELTA PARTNERSHIP  As a result of the deal, Delta will sell its stake in Brazil\u2019s largest airline Gol, a LATAM rival.  Delta does not expect regulatory obstacles for its tie-up with LATAM, where it will gain representation on the board of directors. The plan envisions growth for both carriers, which currently overlap on only one route, Chief Executive Ed Bastian told Reuters.  \u201cI think it\u2019s a great fit,\u201d he said.  Atlanta-based Delta expects the LATAM deal to be accretive to earnings per share over the next two years and add $1 billion in revenue growth over five years, Bastian said.  Delta is using newly issued debt and available cash for the deal. It will also provide LATAM with an additional $350 million to help it transition out of oneworld and plug into Delta\u2019s network.  The two can start code-sharing before they receive government, regulatory and anti-trust approval for the larger tie-up, a process Bastian said he expects to take between 12 and 24 months.  Delta will also acquire four A350 aircraft from LATAM and assume LATAM\u2019s commitment to purchase another 10 A350s to be delivered between 2020 and 2025 for an undisclosed sum.  Apart from its stake in Grupo Aeromexico, Delta also has holdings in Air France KLM, China Eastern, Virgin Atlantic and Korean Air Lines Co\u2019s parent company.  It has also been negotiating a 10% stake in Alitalia as part of its strategy to boost its international presence through equity investments. That plan has not changed with the LATAM deal, which Delta started studying about three months ago after an approach by a third party, Bastian said.  Delta has seen its shares and earnings outpace U.S. rivals this year. Its stock closed 0.8% higher before the announcement.","16":"NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - Shares of American Airlines Group Inc fell more than 5 percent on Thursday as sharply higher fuel costs weighed on profits and spooked investors.  The Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier reported net profit of $186 million, or 39 cents share, in the first quarter, down from $340 million, or 67 cents a share, a year ago.  Excluding items, American earned 75 cents a share, 3 cents above average analyst forecasts.  Fuel expenses jumped 25.7 percent in the quarter.  \u201cHigher fuel prices led to a decline in year-over-year earnings, but we are excited about the future,\u201d American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker said in a statement.  Shares were trading at $42.95, extending a 17-percent year-to-date decline.  Rising costs are an ongoing concern for airlines, as high fuel prices and rich bumps in salaries and benefits for pilots, flight attendants and mechanics have swelled operating expenses.  This has put a damper on what could have been an otherwise rosy operating environment for American. Robust demand for air travel drove a 5.9-percent year-over-year increase in quarterly total revenue to a record $10.4 billion.  American said enhancements to its fleet, notably an order of 47 Boeing 787s, will help improve fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs, saving the carrier money down the line.  Referring to the spike in fuel expenses, American lowered its full-year earnings forecast to between $5 and $6 per share, from between $5.50 and $6.50.  American said it expects second-quarter unit costs, excluding fuel and special items, to rise 3.5 percent due to employee and benefit increases and other costs.  The Dow Jones U.S. Airlines Index was down 2.7 percent on Thursday, and has lost 11 percent this year, on results from American and rival Southwest Airlines.","17":"(Reuters) - American Airlines said it is restarting passenger flights to China on Wednesday, lifting the total number of U.S. weekly flights to 10 as the U.S. government continues to push for more air service between the world\u2019s two largest economies.

The company, which has the second-biggest fleet of MAX aircraft in the United States with 24 jets, now expects unit revenue, a measure that compares sales to flight capacity, to increase between 3% and 4% percent in the quarter ended June, compared with its earlier forecast of a rise of between 1% and 3%.

The October job cuts comprise 17,500 furloughs of union workers -including 1,600 pilots and 8,100 flight attendants - and 1,500 management positions.  Based on current demand levels, American now plans to fly less than 50% of its normal schedule in the fourth quarter, with international flying reduced to only a quarter of 2019 levels, Parker and Isom said in the memo.

American, the largest U.S. airline, announced last month it was canceling about 140 flights a day through April 6.  Once the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) gives 737 MAX approval to return to service, American will need at least 30 days to prepare the jets and its pilots for commercial flights, airline and union officials have said.  Boeing 737 MAXs have been grounded worldwide since March 2019 following an Ethiopian Airlines Co crash, the second of two fatal crashes in five months that killed 346 people.  Reuters has reported the FAA will not approve the return of the MAX until February and it could slip until March or later. Last week, Boeing said it would recommend requiring all pilots to undergo simulator training before resuming flights, which may also push back the resumption of commercial flights.  Last month, United Airlines Holdings Inc UAL.O extended cancellations of its MAX flights from March until June 4.  Without the 737 MAX, United said it was cancelling about 56 flights a day in January and February, which tend to be slower travel months, with daily cancellations rising to 80 in March and April and 108 in May and the early part of June.  Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N, the largest operator of MAX airplanes worldwide, said in December it was removing roughly 300 weekday flights from its total peak-day schedule of more than 4,000 daily flights through April 13, nearly double the amount it had canceled through March 6.","45":"FILE PHOTO: An American Airlines Airbus A321-200 plane takes off from Los Angeles International airport (LAX) in Los Angeles, California, U.S. March 28, 2018.

A decline in fuel prices in 2016 and 2017 led U.S. airlines to discount ticket prices, hurting revenue. Investors have been concerned that the cycle may repeat itself if oil prices do not show an improvement, resulting in depressed fares.  American said it expects its fuel expense to reduce in the fourth quarter to between $2.22 and $2.27 per gallon, compared with $2.30 to $2.35 per gallon earlier.

But while Avianca hopes to restart flights in May, Copa says it may not be able to do so until at least June 1 and is applying emergency measures to save cash.  Copa has long been considered by analysts as the most financially solid of Latin America\u2019s airlines, because its reliance on the Panama City airport for virtually all of its flights represents a big cost efficiency.

American and Southwest, the two largest U.S. operators of Boeing Co's BA.N 737 MAX aircraft that has been grounded since March following two deadly crashes, said they do not have enough aircraft to meet the demand they see in the market.  Both airlines have canceled flights into early June as they operate slimmer fleets but said on Thursday that cancellations would likely extend into the summer or fall after Boeing signaled this week that it does not expect to win regulatory approval for the jets to fly again until mid-year.  Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said the airline is losing 6 million to 7 million customers a year due to the 737 MAX grounding, but said he expects to \u201caggressively recapture\u201d lost market share once the jets return.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pent-up demand for traveling on American.

Shares of American Airlines gained 2.6% to $28.03 while Southwest shares were up 3.5% at $55.35.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  After regulators give the green light, airlines will still need a month or longer to prepare the jets and their pilots.  For Southwest, the world\u2019s largest 737 MAX operator with nearly 10,000 pilots, the training process will take at least a couple of months more than the 30 days that it initially expected now that Boeing is recommending simulator training rather than just computer based training.  Parker said it was too soon to see any impact from the coronavirus that has emerged from Wuhan, China, but said the carrier is working with U.S. public health officials. In response to the outbreak, passengers are being screened as a precaution at airports around the world.  Southwest does not fly to Asia.  For 2020, American said it expects 2020 full-year adjusted earnings between $4 and $6 per share, an estimate some analysts said they thought was conservative.  Southwest, which had bet its entire growth strategy on the 737 MAX, did not provide 2020 guidance given continued uncertainty around when the jets will fly again.  Both companies struck partial compensation deals with Boeing over 737 MAX damages in 2019 and said they expect additional settlements this year.  Smaller U.S. airline JetBlue also posted quarterly earnings on Thursday that showed it delivering on a three-year cost-cutting drive, sending its shares higher.","68":"Feb 19 (Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc:  * AMERICAN AIRLINES SAYS CONTINUES TO INCUR FINANCIAL DAMAGES IN 2020 DUE TO THE GROUNDING OF THE BOEING 737 MAX AIRCRAFT - SEC FILING  * AMERICAN AIRLINES SAYS EXPECT DISCUSSIONS TO CONTINUE WITH BOEING FOR FURTHER COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGES Source text: [bit.ly\/2V6fzum] Further company coverage: (Reuters.Briefs@thomsonreuters.com)","69":"FILE PHOTO: Corporate logos of American Airlines are seen at their office in Caracas, Venezuela March 15, 2019.

He most recently advised Puerto Rico on its debt woes, as well as California on how to best grapple with catastrophic wildfires and the bankruptcy of power utility PG&E Corp PCG.N.

American said it was notified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of its decision to ground the jets earlier on Wednesday.","94":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O said on Thursday it plans to suspend flights to 15 U.S. airports in October as travel demand remains low as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.  Congress has been weighing for weeks whether to grant U.S. airlines another $25 billion in payroll assistance that would keep tens of thousands of airline workers on the job for another six months and extend minimum service requirements.  American shares were off 0.5% in midday trading.  American said it will cancel just over 700 flights in October to and from those 15 airports but warned it could make additional cuts or could reconsider if Congress provides more assistance.  \u201cThis is the first step as American continues to evaluate its network and plans for additional schedule changes in the coming weeks,\u201d the airline said.  Delta Air Lines DAL.N and United Airlines UAL.O declined to comment on their schedule plans.  The debate over airline assistance has stalled as Congress has struggled to reach agreement on a broader coronavirus assistance package.  Some lawmakers think Congress and the White House may not reach a deal until September.  Major U.S. airlines that received portions of $25 billion in payroll assistance were required by the U.S. Transportation Department to maintain minimum flights through Sept. 30, but the government could opt to extend those requirements. American received $5.8 billion in payroll assistance.  Several airlines have been privately warning lawmakers they would be forced to suspend service to some smaller airports without assistance.  American will halt flights to Del Rio, Texas; Dubuque, Iowa; Florence, South Carolina; Greenville, North Carolina; Huntington, West Virginia; Joplin, Missouri; Kalamazoo-Battle Creek, Michigan; Lake Charles, Louisiana; New Haven, Connecticut; New Windsor, New York; Roswell, New Mexico; Sioux City, Iowa; Springfield, Illinois; Stillwater, Oklahoma, and Williamsport, Pennsylvania starting Oct. 7.  The Transportation Department said Thursday it will \u201cmonitor ongoing access by the traveling public to the national air transportation system.\u201d  Travel and transportation sectors, including hotels, restaurants, performance venues, public transit and passenger railroad Amtrak, are seeking significant government assistance.  The U.S. Travel Association said Wednesday that travel \u201cbusinesses and workers cannot wait until September or until after the election. Congress must come together immediately to pass meaningful legislation.\u201d","95":"Jan 28 (Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc reported an $8.9 billion annual loss on Thursday, its biggest on record, as travel restrictions and lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged the aviation industry in 2020.

The Federal Aviation Administration has said pilots and controllers must not fly or conduct safety-related duties for 48 hours after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.  Asked about the memo, American Airlines said it is working on plans to provide the vaccine to pilots and other employees as it becomes available in different states but does not plan to require them unless they are mandated by certain countries for entry.  \u201cAs we work to develop a program to connect our team with the COVID-19 vaccine, we are encouraging team members to get vaccinated as opportunities arise for them to do so,\u201d spokeswoman Stacy Day said.  Inoculation against the disease caused by the coronavirus is considered key to safely reopening large parts of the U.S. economy.  Air travel has been particularly hit hard by the pandemic, and strict rules putting health-care workers first in line has slowed the rollout in the United States.

Wrestling with a sharp downturn in travel demand amid the pandemic, American and United together furloughed more than 32,000 workers in October, when an initial $25 billion to cover six months of airline workers\u2019 salaries expired.  \u201cWe are already starting to work through the details of how we will bring back team members, but we\u2019re not over the finish line yet,\u201d American CEO Doug Parker and President Robert Isom said in a memo on Monday that urged Congress to pass the legislation quickly.  A United spokesman said the company was also preparing to bring back furloughed employees once lawmakers approve the bill.  The House of Representatives and Senate were aiming to pass a bipartisan $900 billion coronavirus aid package before the end of the day.  \u201cIf passed into law quickly, we should be able to get everyone a paycheck on Christmas Eve,\u201d American\u2019s executives said.  The $15 billion earmarked for airlines requires all furloughed workers to be recalled and receive their full salaries from Dec. 1 through March 31, 2021.  The terms of the new assistance program mirror the initial package passed by Congress in March, which required larger airlines to repay 30% of the payroll grants over time and offer the government warrants.  It also requires airlines to resume flying to some routes stopped after the first package expires, and gives the Transportation secretary authority until March 1, 2022 to require flights to small and remote communities that airlines served before the pandemic.  Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, said the legislation will restore paychecks for over 100,000 flight attendants and other aviation workers who lost their jobs on Oct 1.

A CNBC reporter said the wife of the flight captain and the first officer\u2019s mother were both onboard the almost 1,200-mile flight.  American and planemaker Boeing have sought to reassure the public over the plane\u2019s safety after it was cleared by U.S. regulators in November to resume flights.

The grounding was lifted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) last month after Boeing agreed to software upgrades and new safeguards on a key flight control system linked to both fatal crashes.

American Airlines currently has 31 737 MAX aircraft after taking delivery of seven more jets since the FAA lifted its safety ban, including one on Monday and plans to gradually reintroduce the plane to its fleet.  The MAX\u2019s return comes at a time when COVID-19 has thrust the industry into its worst crisis, with airlines parking hundreds of jets as demand hovers around 30% of 2019 levels.  When the 737 MAX was grounded, U.S. airlines canceled flights because they lacked aircraft to meet demand, adding to Boeing\u2019s financial liability.

An application for a joint venture covering the United States, Australia and New Zealand was rejected by former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.  The deal would allow the airlines to coordinate their planning, pricing, sales and frequent flyer programs, with new options and customer service improvements.

American said it now expects 2018 earnings per share in a range of $4.50 and $5.00, down from $5 to $6 previously, and forecast third-quarter unit revenue - a closely watched performance metric that compares sales to flight capacity - to rise 1 to 3 percent.  To boost profitability in what Parker called a \"new reality\" of higher fuel at around $75 per barrel, the No. 1 U.S. carrier by passenger traffic said it will cut costs and defer deliveries of 22 A321neo AIR.PA aircraft from Airbus that were previously scheduled for delivery in 2019, 2020 and 2021.  The deferrals will reduce capital expenditures by $1.2 billion over the next three years, it said.  Among large U.S. rivals, Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N also warned that fuel would squeeze its profit for the full year, while United Airlines UAL.N raised its 2018 profit forecast thanks to a rise in average fares and traffic.  American Airlines\u2019 net income fell to $566 million, or $1.22 per share in the second quarter ended June 30, from $864 million, or $1.75 per share, a year earlier.  On an adjusted basis, American earned $1.63 per share.  Operating revenue rose 3.7 percent to $11.64 billion.  Analysts on average expected quarterly profit of $1.59 per share on revenue of $11.70 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Aside from fuel costs, Parker also attributed some of the airline\u2019s underperformance to its domestic operations and said will allow Basic Economy customers the same carry-on allowance as Main Cabin customers as of Sept. 5 in a move to better compete with lower-fare products.","147":"(Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc and JetBlue Airways Corp said on Thursday they are launching the first phase of their partnership with codeshares on nearly 80 routes from New York and Boston.

New York-based low-cost carrier JetBlue and international major American are hoping the partnership, announced in July, will give them more competitive heft in the U.S. Northeast as the industry recovers from the coronavirus pandemic, which has decimated travel.  \u201cThe alliance is also essential to getting our planes back in the air profitably and crewmembers working again,\u201d said JetBlue\u2019s head of revenue planning, Scott Laurence.  The two airlines are also introducing 33 new routes in the first phase of their alliance, which American\u2019s chief revenue officer, Vasu Raja, called \u201cthe first step to delivering the best customer proposition with the biggest network in New York and Boston.\u201d  Codesharing allows travelers to book with one airline for flights operated by a partner. The two airlines will also begin offering reciprocal benefits on their loyalty programs this spring.  Following a U.S. Department of Transportation review, American and JetBlue agreed to divest some slots at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) near Washington and will refrain from coordinating on some markets.  JetBlue pilots voted earlier this week to reject a tentative agreement that would have given the airline contractual relief to implement the partnership. JetBlue said it still planned to move forward.  The union representing American Airlines\u2019 pilots said on Thursday it was still analyzing the codesharing announcement.","148":"CHICAGO\/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. airlines face a winter test of their finances and question marks over the reach of their domestic flight networks after failing, for now, to win fresh federal aid.

REUTERS\/Adrees Latif\/File Photo  American Airlines and United Airlines began laying off 32,000 workers after a deadline passed with no new help from Washington, but told staff they would reverse this if lawmakers reach a deal on COVID-19 relief.  Late Thursday, the U.S. Senate adjourned until Monday evening, suggesting no action on any airline assistance was near.  U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke for 50 minutes Thursday afternoon but \u201cdistance on key areas remain,\u201d a spokesman for Pelosi said.  White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany on Thursday urged Congress to quickly pass standalone legislation to aid airlines.  U.S. airlines are collectively burning about $5 billion of cash a month as passenger traffic has stalled at around 30% of 2019 levels. After tapping capital markets, they say they have enough liquidity to last them at least 12 months at that rate.  They have argued for another $25 billion in federal payroll aid to maintain their workforce and meet demand as the economy rebounds. Without the money, flight networks could further shrink, hampering their revenue power and shortening their liquidity runway.  Between voluntary and involuntary furloughs, major U.S. airlines\u2019 workforce will shrink by at least 25% in October.  \u201cAirlines quite correctly have been bulking up on cash ... but to be 25% smaller, best case, how are you going to handle the debt service?\u201d asked airline consultant Mike Boyd.  Cities will lose a number of daily flights and non-stop options, Cowen analyst Helane Becker said. \u201cService to small communities will decline pretty dramatically,\u201d she added.  That threat has resonated with some lawmakers even as the bailout request partly fell victim to broader political turmoil in a bitterly divided Washington.  Some airline officials think if Congress cannot reach agreement now on a broad coronavirus relief package, it may include funding for airlines when it takes up the issue again in the coming months.  But an uncertain recovery has not helped the airlines\u2019 case.  Industry experts expect a slight improvement in domestic demand over the winter holidays from current levels, but it will remain far below last year\u2019s volumes. Meanwhile, higher-margin business and international travel remain severely depressed.  Daily passengers at U.S. airports have swung from record highs in 2019 to dramatic lows in 2020, according to Transportation Security Administration (TSA) data.  \u201cRight now airline traffic is equal to where it was in the 1970s,\u201d said Becker. \u201cAnd the industry has a balance sheet that is 2019.\u201d  Chief executives acknowledge that pre-pandemic air travel demand is unlikely to return for years, and still unknown is how the pandemic, which has forced drastic changes in habits, will impact travel behavior.  American Airlines, which said in August it planned to end service to 15 smaller airports without additional government assistance, said Thursday it is set to end service to 11 cities on Oct. 7.  The airline remains in talks with local officials about continuing service to Stillwater, Oklahoma and Roswell, New Mexico. In an order issued last week, the U.S. Transportation Department said American could not immediately halt service to Joplin, Missouri and Sioux City, Iowa.","149":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The grounded Boeing Co 737 MAX is \u201chighly likely\u201d to be flying by mid-August, American Airlines Group Inc Chief Executive Doug Parker told shareholders on Wednesday.

American Airlines\/Handout via REUTERS\/File Photo  A battered aviation industry is awaiting regulatory approval for a software fix and pilot training updates by Boeing that would pave the way for the troubled jet to fly again following two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia within five months.  American Airlines has said the economic impact of the grounded MAX would be about $350 million between its worldwide grounding in mid-March and Aug. 19, when the airline had initially envisioned flying its 24 MAX jets again.  On Sunday, American extended cancellations of about 115 daily flights until Sept. 3, but Parker said that decision merely reflected monthly scheduling plans for crew.  \u201cNo one should take that as some indication that we don\u2019t think the aircraft will be ready by Aug 19,\u201d Parker said during the company\u2019s annual shareholders meeting.  \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be selling seats today if we didn\u2019t think it was a highly likely possibility (...) that we\u2019d be able to provide that service by Sept. 3,\u201d he added.  Boeing has yet to formally submit its software fix to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which said on Wednesday it does not have a specific timetable on when the 737 MAX would return to service.  Still, Parker said he understood there was \u201can absolute fix\u201d for the 737 MAX, while acknowledging there was no certain timetable and that rebuilding public confidence may take time.  Once regulators approve the MAX, airlines will need some time to train pilots on the software fix, meant to prevent the erroneous triggering of a system called MCAS that played a role in the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes, and to prepare the jets following months of storage.  Before the jet flies commercially, Parker said he and other executives would fly in the MAX and noted that if American pilots were comfortable taking up the aircraft, over time, the flying public would recognize that it is safe.  Speaking on CNBC on Wednesday, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said he believed consumer confidence would take a while to restore, and that a MAX return to service was \u201cprobably going to be longer than anyone would like it to be.\u201d  Shares in Delta, which does not operate the MAX, have outperformed those of U.S. rivals with the jets. American shares, which have lost about 4% this year, were up 1.2% on Wednesday.","150":"PLANO, Texas (Reuters) - American Airlines Group's AAL.O pilots want compensation for lost pay stemming from flights canceled as a result of the Boeing 737 MAX grounding, the head of the airline's pilot union said on Tuesday.

REUTERS\/Lindsey Wasson\/File Photo  Boeing Co's BA.N 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in mid-March after two deadly crashes that together killed 346 people in a span of five months and forced MAX carriers like American to cancel more than a hundred daily flights.  \u201cThe effect has been real and calculable,\u201d Allied Pilots Association President Captain Eric Ferguson said at a conference for independent pilot unions in Plano, Texas.  Ferguson said APA pilots are seeking a commitment from American similar to one made by Southwest Airlines LUV.N last month when Chief Executive Gary Kelly promised employees to share any reimbursement from Boeing over the MAX grounding.  \u201cWe\u2019re looking for the same thing,\u201d said Ferguson, noting that while some 737 MAX pilots have been scheduled on other routes, their overall flying hours have decreased as a result of the cancellations.  Negotiations between Boeing and its customers over the financial impact of the grounding, which has also halted deliveries of more than 250 jets that continue to roll off its Seattle production line, are ongoing.  Southwest is the world\u2019s largest MAX carrier. It has 34 jets parked in the California desert awaiting approval to fly again, and 41 more that were scheduled for delivery this year. American has 24 MAX jets and 16 more due this year.  Ferguson, who became president of APA in July, is working closely with American to ensure that its MAX jets are safely returned to service once the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration approves them.  Boeing is developing a software fix and new pilot training that must be reviewed by the FAA. The manufacturer has repeatedly said it is targeting the fourth quarter for the plane to return to service.  Once the FAA gives 737 MAX approval, American will need around 30 days to prepare the jets and its pilots for commercial flight, APA representatives said.  For Southwest, with over 10,000 737 pilots, it may take between 45 to 60 days following approval before the plane resumes commercial flights, representatives from the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association said at the conference.","151":"FILE PHOTO: An American Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight from Los Angeles lands at Reagan National Airport shortly after an announcement was made by the FAA that the planes were being grounded by the United States in Washington, U.S. March 13, 2019.

Rising bookings have fueled revenue growth for the main U.S. carriers, partially because they have been able to charge passengers more for seats that are in scarcer supply following the worldwide MAX grounding in March after two fatal crashes.  But the lower than planned capacity is also weighing on costs.  American, the second largest U.S. operator of the MAX, has removed its 24 jets from its schedule through early November, leading to about 115 daily cancellations.  To compensate for its reduced fleet and the absence of fresh MAX deliveries, the airline will extend the lifespan of other 737 models as well as some 757s and A320s to help it meet demand.  The No.1 U.S. airline by passenger traffic lifted the lower end of its 2019 adjusted profit forecast to between $4.50 per share and $6 per share, up from a previous range of $4.00 per share to $6.00 per share.  Net income rose 19% to $662 million, or $1.49 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30 from a year earlier.  On an adjusted basis, the airline earned $1.82 per share.

Until now most airlines have exempted passengers with medical conditions, though United Airlines UAL.O and Delta Air Lines DAL.N require that any conditions be cleared before flying.

U.S. airlines have grounded nearly half of all airplanes, canceled hundreds of thousands of flights and the industry is still burning through billions a dollars a month. But many airlines are adding back flights in July as demand modestly rebounds.  Speaking to shareholders at the company\u2019s annual meeting, American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker said while passenger numbers are improving, they are \u201cstill a fraction of what they were last year and particularly internationally.\u201d  That makes it difficult to know how many flights it will operate in the fall, when U.S. payroll aid for airlines runs out, and in the summer of 2021.  Still, American and Delta each said their daily cash burn rate was expected to slow to about $40 million in June. American had previously forecast a $50 million-per-day cash burn.  Delta forecast a 90% plunge in second-quarter revenue and warned it would need to renegotiate its debt agreements to avoid a default next year.  To restore confidence in flying, United Airlines UAL.O said on Wednesday it is now requiring all passengers to complete a health self-assessment during their check-in process, based on recommendations from the Cleveland Clinic.

American said revenues per mile flown, a closely watched performance metric which compares sales to flight capacity, would be flat to up 2 percent in the current quarter.  A fall in unit revenue growth to less than 2 percent in the fourth quarter had sent American\u2019s shares spinning lower when it flagged the number earlier this month.  Still, American said it expects its revenue growth to outpace rivals. It forecast $1 billion of additional revenue in 2019 as it continues to optimize its network, expands its Premium Economy product and adds new gates at its Dallas-Fort Worth and Charlotte hubs.  The company also said it sees more than $300 million of cost savings in 2019.  Thursday\u2019s numbers showed fuel expenses rose almost 20 percent in the quarter.  The company forecast full-year earnings per share to rise between 21 percent and 65 percent, well above the 30 percent increase expected by analysts on average, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The No. 1 U.S. airline by passenger traffic said net income, excluding special items, rose 8.3 percent to $481 million, or $1.04 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, beating analysts\u2019 estimate of $1.01 per share.  Total operating revenue rose 3.1 percent to $10.94 billion.","167":"Jan 28 (Reuters) - American Airlines said on Thursday its regional carrier PSA has temporarily removed most of its aircraft from service and it is rebooking passengers while it works with the Federal Aviation Administration to address the issue.  \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, PSA Airlines has temporarily removed most of its aircraft from service in order to complete a necessary, standard inspection on the nose gear door,\u201d a spokeswoman said.

REUTERS\/Joshua Roberts  Airlines including American are taking steps to reduce costs and downsize their fleets to more closely match a drastic drop in travel demand due to the pandemic.  American had more than 900 jets in its fleet in 2019 and commitments to purchase another 248, according to regulatory filings.  To reduce its overall fleet size, it will accelerate the retirement of older aircraft, rather than push back deliveries as rivals like Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N have announced.  In an interview with Reuters, Parker said the airline will have around 100 fewer jets in the summer of 2021 than it had planned given the early retirements.  \u201cThat\u2019s how we\u2019ll reduce our fleet, rather than pushing off deliveries,\u201d Parker said.  Earlier, American said it was bringing forward the retirement of Boeing 757 and 767 jets, Airbus A330-300s and Embraer 190s due to a decline in demand for travel.  The retirements, first reported by Reuters in March, contributed to a $1.4 billion one-time charge in the first quarter.  American is due to receive 69 new aircraft this year, including 18 jets from the Airbus 320neo family and 22 Boeing 737 MAX planes, according to regulatory filings. On a conference call with investors, the company said those purchases were already fully financed.  Delivery of the 737 MAX jets is uncertain, however, as Boeing Co BA.N awaits regulatory approval for the jets to fly again since two fatal crashes led to a global grounding last year.","169":"(Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc said Sunday it is extending cancellations of about 115 daily flights into September due to the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX.

American Airlines said Sunday it is extending those cancellations through Sept. 3. Boeing has yet to complete a certification test flight and formally submit its software upgrade and training changes to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for approval.  Boeing said Sunday it is continuing \u201cto work with global regulators to provide them the information they need to certify the MAX update and related training and education material and safely return the fleet to service.\u201d  The world\u2019s largest airplane manufacturer said it is \u201cpartnering with our airline customers to maintain their planes in storage and will provide \u2018entry into service\u2019 type support once they are cleared to resume commercial operation.\u201d  The FAA declined to comment on Sunday.  The FAA\u2019s acting chief, Dan Elwell, told reporters last month he does not have a specific timetable to unground the 737 MAX.  The plane was grounded in March following a fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash just months after a similar Lion Air disaster in Indonesia which together killed 346 people.  Southwest Airlines Co and United Airlines have canceled flights into August because of the grounding of the 737 MAX.  Asked last month it is realistic that the 737 MAX could be flying again by August, Elwell declined to be specific.  \u201cIf you said October I wouldn\u2019t even say that, only because we haven\u2019t finished determining exactly what the training requirements will be,\u201d Elwell said. \u201cIf it takes a year to find everything we need to give us the confidence to lift the (grounding) order so be it.\u201d  Global airlines that had rushed to buy the fuel-efficient, longer-range aircraft have since canceled flights and scrambled to cover routes that were previously flown by the MAX.  Boeing hopes the software upgrade and associated pilot training will add layers of protection to prevent erroneous data from triggering a system called MCAS, which was activated in both the planes before they crashed.","170":"July 26 (Reuters) - American Airlines said on Thursday its second-quarter profit fell 34.5 percent, hurt by higher fuel costs.

The policies exempt young children from wearing masks or other facial coverings.  Many U.S. airlines are also requiring pilots and flight attendants to use facial coverings while on board aircraft.  Airlines in the United States have seen a nearly 95% drop in U.S. passengers and have slashed flight schedules. They are now working to reassure customers about the safety of air travel by instituting new cleaning and social distancing procedures.  Some airline unions and U.S. lawmakers have urged the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to require facial coverings for all passengers and crew.  United said it will provide complimentary masks to passengers. Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N, one of the largest U.S. airlines, has not required facial coverings.  The FAA has declined to implement the requirement, and it is not clear if the agency has the authority to compel passengers to wear face masks.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The treaty will be sent to President Michel Temer, who is expected to sign it into law. The agreement allows an unlimited number of flights between Brazil and the United States, the favorite destination of Brazilian tourists, and should result in lower airfare prices.  It is expected to lead to increased interest by the U.S. airline industry in the potentially huge Brazilian market.  The Open Skies treaty was signed in 2011 but faced opposition from lawmakers lobbied by local airline interests in Brazil, who feared competition from U.S. carriers.  The accord was a requirement for the U.S. Department of Transportation to approve a business deal between American Airlines and LATAM, the two largest carriers in the region, which would see them co-ordinating schedules and offering more connections.  Brazil's anti-trust agency has already given the green light for the partnership. In 2016, Chile-headquartered LATAM signed the joint business agreement with American, and another with IAG's ICAG.L British Airways and Iberia, all members of the Oneworld Alliance.  American Airlines applauded the treaty\u2019s approval.  \u201cOpen Skies agreements have proven to increase travel choices and enhance competition, resulting in greater benefits for consumers and positively impacting economic growth,\u201d the airline said in a statement.  Brazil's third-biggest airline, Azul Linhas A\u00e9reas AZUL.N, which started in 2008, initially opposed the agreement, arguing that it needed to establish itself in the Brazilian market before it was opened up to further competition.  The treaty was backed by GOL Linhas A\u00e9reas Inteligentes GOLL4.SA, Brazil's second airline in which Delta Airlines Inc DAL.N has a 9.48 percent stake, and Avianca Brasil, which hopes to seal a business deal with United Continental Holdings Inc UAL.N in the near future.  Brazil\u2019s center-right government is backing separate legislation to remove or ease limits on foreign investment in Brazilian airlines, currently restricted to 20 percent of common voting shares.  Flights between Brazil and the United States are expected to surge by 30 percent as a result of Open Skies, according to Brazil\u2019s tourism board Embratur.

United Airlines UAL.O is also selling planes to capacity though both notify passengers of full flights and allow them to re-book.  Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said at a Senate hearing that there was \u201csubstantial disappointment\u201d with American, given many airlines are keeping middle seats open.  \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right message,\u201d Redfield said.  Some lawmakers want Congress to require open seats on commercial flights.

The partnership with Alaska will provide connections through Seattle to Bangalore from 100 U.S. cities, he said, citing demand from markets as vast as Boston, Raleigh, Austin, Chicago and the West Coast.  The new Bangalore route, which American plans to service with a Boeing 787-9, will be the carrier\u2019s only U.S. flight to India since it stopped flying to Delhi in 2012.  There is more demand for business class seats to India than the last time American flew there - partially due to improved premium cabins with lay flat seats - making flights more viable, Raja said.  American continues to see strong bookings across the world despite a recent drop in demand to China following the coronavirus outbreak, he said, adding that by building up networks and partnerships, airlines can be more nimble in terms of adjusting to any fall-offs in demand.  By teaming up with Alaska Airlines, American can also explore new markets in South East Asia and the South Pacific from Seattle that were previously beyond the carrier\u2019s range, Raja said.  The two airlines will expand their codeshare to include international routes from Los Angeles and Seattle, and Alaska Airlines intends to join the oneworld alliance by summer 2021, the two companies said.

Air passenger traffic is down by about 70% versus a year ago as the coronavirus pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the travel industry. U.S. airlines furloughed tens of thousands of employees when an initial $25 billion in federal payroll support that banned job cuts expired in October.  United Airlines executives warned on Monday that its recall of furloughed employees after the fresh aid would be \u201ctemporary,\u201d saying \u201cwe just don\u2019t see anything in the data that shows a huge difference in bookings over the next few months.\u201d  American said the relief would help airlines serve passengers once the pandemic subsides, and in the nearer term, aid in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and other critical supplies.  Airlines have said they do not expect a robust travel recovery until vaccines or effective treatments are widely available.  American, which has furloughed nearly 19,000 employees since October, stands to receive roughly $3 billion from the payroll package, one person briefed on the matter said.  The new aid package includes similar conditions as the previous one, such as caps on executive compensation and share buybacks, and requires airlines to repay 30% of the payroll grants over time, offer the government warrants, and restore some routes.  The program could stave off job reductions for the time being at Southwest Airlines, which has asked unions to accept pay cuts to prevent its first-ever furloughs next year.  A Southwest spokesman said the company had no updates on the potential furloughs and would closely examine the final terms and conditions of the program once the bill becomes law.  Among other large U.S. carriers, Delta Air Lines avoided furloughs this year after reducing work hours for its largely non-union staff. Its unionized pilots agreed to pay cuts to avoid furloughs through 2021.","217":"Oct 22 (Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc reported a third straight quarterly loss on Thursday, hurt by a slump in travel globally due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Other U.S. airlines, including Delta Airlines Inc, United Continental Holdings Inc and JetBlue Airways Inc, have also announced price hikes recently.  The moves come at a time when Congress is considering whether to require the U.S. Transportation Department to assess if airline baggage and ticket change fees are \u201creasonable and proportional.\u201d  Airlines have cited rising costs as a concern, with high fuel prices and bumps in salaries and benefits for pilots, flight attendants and mechanics pushing up operating expenses.  In July, American cut its 2018 earnings forecast for the second time after it reported a 34.5 percent drop in quarterly profit, hurt by higher fuel costs.  U.S. airlines\u2019 revenues from baggage and reservation-change fees increased from $5.7 billion in 2010 to $7.5 billion in 2017. Other fees are not reported to regulators.  United Airlines Chief Executive Oscar Munoz defended the price hikes last week, saying they were the first increases in eight years.  Southwest Airlines Co, the No. 4 U.S. airline, has said it would continue to allow passengers to check two bags and does not charge reservation-change fees.  U.S. House of Representatives and Senate negotiators have been holding lengthy talks on a compromise bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration, which could be unveiled as early as Friday. Congress faces a Sept. 30 deadline to extend the FAA\u2019s operating authority.

Boeing Co is targeting regulatory approval for the fixes in October, though the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has said it does not have a firm timeline to put the jets back in the air.

American Airlines and United Airlines began laying off 32,000 workers after a deadline passed with no new help from Washington, but told staff they would reverse this if lawmakers reach a deal on COVID-19 relief.  U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were expected to continue negotiations on Thursday.  U.S. airlines are collectively burning about $5 billion of cash a month as passenger traffic has stalled at around 30% of 2019 levels. After tapping capital markets, they say they have enough liquidity to last them at least 12 months at that rate.  They have argued for another $25 billion in federal payroll aid to maintain their workforce and meet demand as the economy rebounds. Without the money, flight networks could further shrink, hampering their revenue power and shortening their liquidity runway.  Between voluntary and involuntary furloughs, major U.S. airlines\u2019 workforce will shrink by at least 25% in October.  \u201cAirlines quite correctly have been bulking up on cash ... but to be 25% smaller, best case, how are you going to handle the debt service?\u201d asked airline consultant Mike Boyd.  Cities will lose a number of daily flights and non-stop options, Cowen analyst Helane Becker said. \u201cService to small communities will decline pretty dramatically,\u201d she added.  That threat has resonated with some lawmakers even as the bailout request partly fell victim to broader political turmoil in a bitterly divided Washington.  And an uncertain recovery has not helped the airlines\u2019 case.  Industry experts expect a slight improvement in domestic demand over the winter holidays from current levels, but it will remain far below last year\u2019s volumes, and higher-margin business and international travel remain severely depressed.  Daily passengers at U.S. airports have swung from record highs in 2019 to dramatic lows in 2020, according to Transportation Security Administration (TSA) data.  \u201cRight now airline traffic is equal to where it was in the 1970s,\u201d said Becker. \u201cAnd the industry has a balance sheet that is 2019.\u201d  Chief executives acknowledge that pre-pandemic air travel demand is unlikely to return for years, and still unknown is how the pandemic, which has forced drastic changes in habits, will impact travel behavior.  This has accelerated a deeper economic debate over which sectors should be propped up.  Top International Monetary Fund officials warned last month that certain sectors, including travel, were facing a \u201cprolonged decline\u201d due to the lingering impact of the coronavirus pandemic.  \u201cMany firms in these sectors may no longer be viable. This will require gradually unwinding the lifelines extended to these firms so that labor and capital may be reallocated away from such shrinking sectors to growing sectors such as online retail and other e-commerce,\u201d IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and chief economist Gita Gopinath wrote in Foreign Policy magazine.

Last week, American Airlines said that avoiding furloughs will be difficult and it expects to have between 10% and 20% more workers than needed in July 2021.  Earlier in the day, rival JetBlue JBLU.O and pilots' union Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), reached an agreement to avoid involuntary furlough until May 1, 2021.  Separately, American Airlines said on Wednesday it expects its summer 2021 long-haul international capacity to be down 25% compared with 2019, as it sees significantly lesser business from its international market.

The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act requires companies to provide 60 days\u2019 notice of potential layoffs or furloughs.  In a memo to employees released on Wednesday, American said the notices are tied to the overstaffing it expects in October when U.S. government payroll assistance expires.  American, with more than 130,000 employees in 2019, had already warned that furloughs would be hard to avoid as pandemic-hit revenue remains more sluggish than the airline had hoped.  Among different work groups, warnings are being sent to 2,500 pilots or about 18% of the total, nearly 10,000 flight attendants or 37% of the total, and 3,200 mechanics or 22% of the total.  Overall, American expects to be overstaffed by about 20,000 in the fall, but hopes to reduce the actual number of furloughs through enhanced leave and early-departure programs it has rolled out alongside unions, Chief Executive Doug Parker and President Robert Isom said in the memo.  They noted, however, that if Congress passes another round of payroll support through March 31, the need for involuntary furloughs at that time would be \u201cmuch less throughout the industry\u201d because \u201cthere would most certainly be more demand for air travel.\u201d  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Unions representing aviation workers have asked lawmakers for another $32 billion in payroll aid to keep hundreds of thousands of workers employed for another six months past October. Airlines are not opposed to the idea but so far have not actively lobbied for it.  Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N said this week it believed it could avoid furloughs after about 17,000 employees signed up for early-departure deals.  By encouraging more senior workers to leave, U.S. airlines could trim their labor costs - their main expense - during the recovery, giving them more pricing power. Airline union contracts require airlines to furlough junior workers first.  United Airlines UAL.O has sent 36,000 furlough notices, representing about 45% of workers, and Southwest Airlines LUV.N has also warned that job losses will be hard to avoid.  After boosting summer flying following some signs of pent-up leisure demand in May and June, some airlines are now scaling back their schedules due to a surge in COVID-19 cases across the country.  The U.S. outbreak has prompted several countries to impose travel restrictions on Americans. The European Union excluded the United States from its \u201csafe\u201d travel list.  Both Canada and Mexico want to extend the ban on non-essential travel at U.S. borders.  Even within the United States, Americans from 22 states are required to self-quarantine for 14 days if they enter New York or New Jersey, two states that have managed to curb infections.","274":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O is set to sharply increase the number of jets it is planning to retire beyond its announced plans as it accelerates a fleet transformation to respond to the coronavirus crisis, people familiar with the matter said.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Some 4,700 jets have been parked globally as airlines slash operations due to travel restrictions, according to Ascend by Cirium fleet data, and American\u2019s decision confirms industry speculation that many of those older jets will not fly again.  In addition to the retirement of 34 Boeing Co BA.N 757s and 17 Boeing 767s announced just two weeks ago, American now plans to also sunset a batch of 76 Boeing 737s it acquired between 1999 and 2001, nine Airbus SE AIR.PA A330-300s and 20 Embraer E190s, the people said.  The plans were announced by President Robert Isom in a video Q&A with employees on Sunday, where he said the arrival of new Boeing 737 MAX jets, expected later this year after a prolonged global grounding, could help facilitate the retirement of older jets that would be in need of heavy maintenance.  American is also considering retiring some of its 50-seat regional jets, he said.  American said on March 12 it was accelerating the retirement of its remaining Boeing 757s and 767s as it looks at removing older, less fuel-efficient aircraft from its fleet.  \u201cDecisions beyond the 757 and 767 have yet to be finalized, and we continue to make refinements to our overall fleet plan,\u201d American spokesman Ross Feinstein said, adding that decisions would be based on demand.  Airlines around the world have slashed capacity and even the planes flying are nearly empty. Data firm OAG said the aviation industry was less than half the size it was in mid-January, just before countries started confirming coronavirus cases outside China.  Aside from heavy maintenance needs on the A330-300s and some of the 737s, American was also facing retrofitting costs on some of the 737s. It said on Monday it would be seeking up to $12 billion from a government aid package meant to help airlines manage costs during the downturn, particularly for employee payroll.  The pace of aircraft retirements influences an airline\u2019s cost structure since new aircraft are costly to buy but cheaper to run. It also gives a clue to potential future demand for new aircraft.  Some analysts are predicting a surplus of aircraft as a wounded airline industry emerges from the coronavirus lockdown into what many economists expect to be a broad recession.  But decisions by airlines to retire planes in 2020 and 2021 could trim that surplus, Ascend by Cirium consultancy head Rob Morris told an Airline Economics webinar on Friday.  The last two years saw a total of 1,130 retirements, he said. Aircraft demand is influenced by a combination of new production and the rate at which airlines retire older planes.  Airlines\u2019 fleet plans had been structured around expectations that global travel demand would continue to grow this year and beyond, but now analysts do not expect passenger traffic to recover 2019 levels for some time.  As jets head to parking lots or graveyards, an American 767 landed in Miami from Lima, Peru late Monday in what could have been the final flight for its 767 fleet.  So far American has temporarily parked 135 out of 150 widebodies -- including 787 Dreamliners -- and more than 300 single-aisle jets, and may continue to park more of its smaller aircraft as the crisis continues, Isom told employees.","275":"(Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Wednesday ordered that an American Airlines mechanic charged with purposely damaging an aircraft that was due to take off from Miami with 150 aboard remain behind bars before a trial, court papers showed.  Abdul-Majeed Marouf Ahmed Alani, who is no longer employed by American, is a flight risk and a danger to the community, the court said. The incident occurred in July.  According to local media, U.S. Magistrate Judge Chris McAliley cited new evidence of potential terrorism sympathies when denying bail, including videos on Alani\u2019s cellphone depicting Islamic State mass murders.  However, court papers on Wednesday did not show any change in the charge against Alani, a U.S. citizen, to suggest any link to terrorism.  \u201cWe are cooperating with federal authorities in this investigation.

When law enforcement officials interviewed Alani after his arrest, he claimed he was upset over stalled labor talks and that he had tampered with the aircraft hoping that a delay or cancellation would lead to overtime work.  Pilots aborted the take-off after receiving an error message and no one was injured.  American\u2019s mechanics have not had a joint contract since the carrier merged with U.S. Airways in 2013. Both sides are talking before a mediator this week in Washington.  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said last week that it had revoked Alani\u2019s mechanic certificate.","276":"March 14 (Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc:  * AMERICAN AIRLINES-EVALUATING ITS CURRENT SCHEDULED SERVICE TO UK & IRELAND, HAS NOT YET MADE ANY ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS SCHEDULE AT THIS TIME Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","277":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An American Airlines mechanic was ordered temporarily detained Friday after he was charged with purposely damaging an aircraft in July amid a dispute between the airline and its mechanics union involving stalled contract negotiations.  Abdul-Majeed Marouf Ahmed Alani will remain in custody pending a hearing on Wednesday, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office said. Federal prosecutors are requesting he continue to be detained pending trial.  Pilots of a flight from Miami to Nassau, Bahamas, on July 17 aborted takeoff plans after receiving an error message involving the flight computer, which reports speed, pitch and other data, according to a criminal complaint filed on Thursday in U.S. District Court in Miami.  It said after returning to the gate for maintenance, a mechanic discovered a loosely connected pitot tube, which measures airspeed and connects directly to the flight computer.  A later review of video surveillance footage before the flight captured \u201cwhat appears to be the sabotage of the aircraft\u201d by a man walking with a limp, the complaint said.  When Alani was interviewed, he told law enforcement he was upset at the stalled contract between the union and American, which he said had affected him financially, according to the complaint. It said Alani claimed to have tampered with the aircraft to cause a delay or have the flight canceled in anticipation of obtaining overtime work.  Unions have complained that American is trying to outsource more maintenance jobs, a move American has indicated is necessary to cover increased wages.  In a statement bit.ly\/2N09Na8 on Friday, American said it was scheduled to resume negotiations with its mechanics union at the National Mediation Board in Washington, D.C. on Sept. 16.  A U.S. federal court last month issued a permanent injunction against American\u2019s mechanics union, which the airline had accused of illegal slowdowns it said had devastated its operations during the peak summer travel season.  A spokesman for American said the airline had an \u201cunwavering commitment\u201d to safety and security and had placed passengers on the July 17 flight subject to the criminal complaint on another plane to get to their destination.  \u201cAt the time of the incident, the aircraft was taken out of service, maintenance was performed and after an inspection to ensure it was safe the aircraft was returned to service,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cAmerican immediately notified federal law enforcement, who took over the investigation with our full cooperation.\u201d  Court records do not indicate whether Alani had an attorney.

U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on Friday wrote on Twitter that on two days last week he had American flights canceled at the last minute because of mechanical issues and \u201cnow we learn an American mechanic was caught sabotaging planes due to labor dispute.\u201d He added he wants mechanics to get a fair contract.","278":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) on Friday granted American Airlines Group Inc and Qantas Airways Ltd final approval to operate a joint venture after a prior effort was rejected in 2016.  FILE PHOTO: An American Airlines airplane sits on the tarmac at LAX in Los Angeles, California, U.S., March 4, 2019. Picture taken March 4, 2019. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  The department last month had issued an order tentatively approving the agreement and granting antitrust immunity to the airlines covering international service.  U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao announced the approval on Friday afternoon, noting it was the first completed review of an airline joint venture proposal during the Trump administration.  Reuters was the first to report on the planned announcement earlier on Friday.  An application for a joint venture covering the United States, Australia and New Zealand was rejected in November 2016 by former President Barack Obama\u2019s DOT. It tentatively concluded after a 17-month review that the venture \u201cwould reduce competition and consumer choice.\u201d  The deal will allow the airlines to coordinate planning, pricing, sales and frequent flyer programs, with new options and customer service improvements. The two OneWorld alliance carriers are planning up to three new routes within the first two years as well as increased capacity on existing routes, the department has said.  American Airlines did not immediately comment on Friday, but Chief Executive Doug Parker said last month the joint venture would also create new jobs in the airlines and industries.  In June, JetBlue Airways Corp told the DOT that it took no position on the alliance, but said it would \u201csubstantially reduce competition in relevant markets and concentrate a huge level of market share and power in the hands of immunized alliances.\u201d  It also said the three major global airline alliances - OneWorld, SkyTeam and StarAlliance - will control 86% of the U.S.-Australia market.  U.S. regulators in 2001 approved similar joint venture agreements for United Airlines and Air New Zealand Ltd, and in 2011 for Delta Air Lines Inc and Virgin Australia.  The U.S. DOT is, however, requiring American and Qantas to perform a self-assessment of the venture\u2019s impact on competition seven years after it takes effect and report their findings to the government.  Regulators in Australia and New Zealand approved the first application for the joint venture before it was initially rejected by the U.S. DOT.  American and Qantas in February 2018 made a second attempt to gain U.S. regulatory permission under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration for a venture that would let them coordinate prices and schedules. They threatened to cancel services if it was rejected and argued it could \u201cunlock\u201d up to $310 million annually in consumer benefits.  The revised application made significant changes, including removing a provision that would have barred either carrier from code-sharing with other carriers. Code-sharing allows two or more carriers to publish and advertise a single flight under their own flight number.  The airlines argued in their 2018 application that the venture would lead to lower fares and higher capacity as a \u201cmore viable third competitor,\u201d and drive other carriers to improve quality, schedules and prices.  Qantas said last year the joint venture would allow the two airlines to \u201csignificantly improve service\u201d and \u201cstimulate demand.\u201d  The airlines said the agreement could generate up to 180,000 new trips between the United States and Australia and New Zealand annually.","279":"Passenger wears a protective face mask as he walks past the American Airlines ticketing desk at Josep Tarradellas Barcelona-El Prat Airport, after further cases of coronavirus were confirmed in Barcelona, Spain March 12, 2020.

Hundreds of experts will gather in Geneva next week, on Feb. 11-12, in an attempt to find a way to fight back against the outbreak by speeding research into drugs and vaccines, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. A multinational WHO-led team would go to China \u201cvery soon\u201d, it added.  It stressed no known effective treatment existed to combat the virus, dismissing various reports of \u201cdrug breakthroughs\u201d.  China said another 65 people had died in the previous 24 hours, in the highest daily total yet, taking the overall toll on the mainland to 490, most in and around the locked-down central city of Wuhan, where the new virus emerged late last year.  There have been two deaths outside mainland China - in the Philippines and Hong Kong - both following visits to Wuhan.  The virus had disrupted air travel, with more than two dozen airlines suspending or restricting flights to China and several countries, including the United States, banning the entry of anyone who has been in China over the previous two weeks.  Hong Kong said all visitors from mainland China would be quarantined for two weeks, while Taiwan banned the entry of mainland residents from Thursday.  The disruption spread to cruise ships this week, with about 3,700 people facing at least two weeks cut off aboard a liner anchored off Japan after health officials confirmed 10 passengers had tested positive for the virus.  Passengers on the Diamond Princess posted pictures online of officials in masks and gowns conducting health checks and an empty deck.  \u201cThis is not a good situation,\u201d British passenger David Abel said in a video shot in his cabin and posted to Facebook.  In Hong Kong, 3,600 passengers and crew were confined to their ship docked in the city for tests after three people on board had tested positive earlier.  Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways 0293.HK asked its 27,000 employees to take three weeks of unpaid leave, saying conditions were as grave now as during the 2009 financial crisis.  American Airlines Group AAL.O and United Airlines UAL.O said they would suspend flights to and from Hong Kong after this week, a step that would leave no U.S. carriers flying passengers to the Asian financial hub.  About half of the air cargo carried globally is in the belly of passenger jets rather than dedicated freighters.  FACTORY DISRUPTION  Nearly $700 billion was wiped off mainland Chinese stocks on Monday with many factories shut, cities cut off and travel links constricted, fuelling worries about global supply chains. Asian stocks steadied on Wednesday.

Planemaker Airbus AIR.PA has prolonged a planned closure of its final assembly plant in Tianjin, China, it said.  Taiwan's Foxconn 2317.TW, which makes phones for global vendors including Apple AAPL.O, aims to gradually restart factories in China next week but could take at least a week or two more to resume full production, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.  German sportswear company Adidas ADSGn.DE said it was temporarily shutting a \"considerable\" number of its stores in China.  Slideshow ( 10 images )  White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the epidemic would delay a surge in U.S. exports to China expected from a Phase 1 trade deal set to take effect this month.  European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said the virus was adding to economic doubts.  \u201cWhile the threat of a trade war between the United States and China appears to have receded, the coronavirus adds a new layer of uncertainty,\u201d she said in Paris.  HUMAN-TO-HUMAN SPREAD  Evidence of human-to-human spread outside China surfaced after an international business gathering in Singapore in January was linked to virus cases reported in Malaysia and South Korea, but authorities did not comment on its nature or the industry involved.  Singapore - one of the worst hit countries outside China in the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - has reported 28 cases of the new coronavirus.  Across mainland China, there were a total of 24,363 coronavirus infections, according to the WHO. Nearly 230 cases have been reported in some 27 countries and regions outside mainland China, a Reuters tally based on official statements shows.  \u201cThe relatively small number of cases outside China gives us a window of opportunity to prevent this outbreak from becoming a broader global crisis,\u201d WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference.  The WHO has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency and says face masks are important in curbing transmission if someone is showing symptoms.

REUTERS\/Nick Oxford\/File Photo  Vasu Raja, American Airlines\u2019 senior vice president of Network Strategy, told Reuters that the airline is cutting between 70% and 75% of flights in April and about 80% of flights in May. For this month and May it is cutting nearly 90% of its international flights.  Raja said domestic demand will remain weak into May, citing of the lack of bookings.  Still, the largest U.S. airline has no plans to halt U.S. flights entirely, noting medical workers and others who must travel, sometimes for urgent medical reasons. \u201cWe are making no plans for the cessation of flying,\u201d Raja said. \u201cThe important thing is to provide a minimum level of essential service to customers ... but we do it in such a way where we don\u2019t burn an excessive amount of cash.\u201d  Across the industry, at some major airports overall U.S. flights are down 50% to 70%, officials say. The number of people who went through U.S. airport checkpoints hit another new low on Wednesday at just 136,023, down from 2.2 million a year ago.  American also disclosed on Thursday that it will cancel more than 60% of its total international flights this summer, including an 80% reduction in Pacific capacity, a 65% reduction in Atlantic and 48% reduction in Latin America. American is also delaying the launch of new international routes until 2021, delaying the launch of new winter seasonal service and suspending 25 summer seasonal flights.  The cuts in May are striking. American Airlines will go from the pre-crisis typical 250 weekday flights from Washington Reagan National Airport to about 28 in May. It will shrink from close to 100 flights a day at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport to just 11 flights a day. At its Dallas-Fort Worth hub, American will decline from nearly 1,000 planned flights a day this summer to around 350.  The cuts are prompted by the sharp demand reduction. \u201cLiterally we have flights that are 5% full,\u201d Raja said. Washington flights are often 10-12% full and been hurt by a big decline in government travel, he added.  Still, American has no idea when things will turn around. \u201cIf we are the bottom it is only because gross bookings have fallen to zero and they can\u2019t go any lower than that,\u201d Raja said. \u201cPretty soon we\u2019ll even run out of people to cancel on U.S. airlines.\u201d  American will not fly its A330 fleet through the end of the summer to conserve costs.  American has said it is eligible for $12 billion out of $50 billion in U.S. government loans and grants for the airline industry.","286":"March 17 (Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc:  * AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC. - AMERICAN AIRLINES MAKES CHANGES TO ADMIRALS CLUB LOUNGES AND FLAGSHIP LOUNGES IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19  * AMERICAN AIRLINES - TEMPORARILY CLOSED SOME U.S. ADMIRALS CLUB LOCATIONS IN AIRPORTS WITH MULTIPLE LOUNGES IN RESPONSE TO DECREASED DEMAND Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","287":"WASHINGTON\/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday asked airlines to halt furloughs and firings, saying a long-awaited deal to provide another $25 billion in aid for the struggling sector was \u201cimminent.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi participates in a news conference at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S. October 1, 2020. REUTERS\/Erin Scott\/File Photo  American Airlines and United Airlines began furloughing 32,000 workers this week but reiterated on Friday that they would reverse course if Congress acts quickly to extend the payroll support program.  A final deal does not appear likely until next week at the earliest when both chambers could vote on a standalone measure or adopt a broad-based coronavirus relief package of $1.5 trillion or more. Talks between Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on that bigger bill are continuing.  Earlier, Representative Peter DeFazio, chair of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, failed to win approval of a standalone bipartisan measure under unanimous consent after some Republicans objected.  Republicans \u201ckilled this legislation,\u201d DeFazio said angrily, hitting a lectern. \u201cThese people\u2019s lives are at stake.\u201d  Pelosi said despite the setback \u201cDemocrats will continue our efforts to provide direly-needed relief for airline workers.\u201d  The House is to return to session Tuesday, and the Senate could take up a standalone measure next week if a broader coronavirus deal is not reached.  Last week, Senator Roger Wicker had sought to win unanimous approval of a standalone airline measure but faced opposition from a few senators.  A spokesman for Senator Rick Scott on Friday said his boss still had concerns with the airline payroll assistance bill and at least one other senator reportedly also has concerns according to congressional aides.  It is also possible the Senate may not return as scheduled next week after Senator Mike Lee disclosed Friday he had tested positive for the coronavirus.  Still, Pelosi\u2019s support was a major step forward, said Association of Flight Attendants-CWA President Sara Nelson, who has rallied thousands of airline workers to keep pressuring lawmakers for a deal.  \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that the widely expressed, bipartisan support for saving airline jobs will lead to a legislative breakthrough soon,\u201d United Airlines spokesman Frank Benenati said. \u201cBut they need to act quickly.\u201d  Republican Senator John Cornyn, who is up for re-election in Texas where American Airlines is based, applauded Pelosi\u2019s decision to advance a standalone relief bill, saying that protecting airline workers jobs \u201cwill help keep air travel safe and protect this vital sector of our economy.\u201d  Separately, the National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) sent a letter on Thursday urging Congress to include new consumer protection measures for passengers on matters including ticket refunds as part of a financial relief package or in separate legislation.  Congress in March approved a $50 billion bailout for the passenger airline industry, half primarily in the form of grants to fund payroll costs and half in government loans.  They have asked for another $25 billion in payroll support to keep their workforce and meet demand as the economy rebounds.","288":"(Reuters) - American Airlines Group AAL.O said on Wednesday it would make good on its plan to return Boeing Co's BA.N 737 MAX jets to passenger flights by the end of 2020 after the planemaker won U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval to fly them again.  The No.1 U.S. airline said it will begin with non-commercial flights in early December before resuming passenger flights later in the month.  The airline said it will operate two flights a day, or one round-trip between Miami and New York from Dec. 29 to Jan. 4.  The FAA detailed software upgrades and training changes Boeing must make in order for it to resume commercial flights after a 20-month grounding, the longest in commercial aviation history.  Smaller rival United Airlines UAL.O announced plans to return the 737 MAX aircraft to service in the first quarter of 2021. Southwest Airlines LUV.N, the world's largest MAX operator, had in October said it does not plan to fly the aircraft until the second quarter of 2021.  The Boeing 737 MAX planes had been grounded since March 2019 after two fatal crashes killed 346 people.","289":"FILE PHOTO: A member of a ground crew walks past American Airlines planes parked at the gate during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, U.S., April 5, 2020.

American, the largest U.S. airline, said the compensation will be received over several years. The airline will use more than $30 million of the compensation for the airline\u2019s 2019 employee profit-sharing program.  American said it does not expect any material financial impact of the agreement to be realized in its fourth-quarter 2019 earnings and it will continue talks regarding compensation for damages related to the MAX grounding beyond 2019.  Boeing said it does not comment on discussions with airlines.  Boeing\u2019s best-selling 737 MAX has been grounded since two fatal crashes in five months killed 346 people. The company is halting production this month.

IATA, which represents about 280 airlines comprising 83 percent of global air traffic, has said that on Monday it will revise down its forecast for industry profitability this year due to higher oil, infrastructure and labor costs.  The United States last month agreed a deal with the United Arab Emirates and in January with Qatar to resolve claims from the three largest U.S. carriers that Gulf airlines had received unfair government subsidies.  Parker said he was pleased with the result of the talks but needed to see more from the Gulf carriers before American Airlines could consider partnerships with them.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t had enough time to make sure that those resolutions have the effect that we hope for, so we shall see,\u201d he said.  Qatar Airways had plans to buy a stake in American Airlines last year, but reversed that decision, saying an investment did not meet its objectives. American Airlines executives had opposed the share buy.  When asked on Sunday whether he would be open to investments from Gulf airlines further down the line, Parker said American Airlines did not need such transactions. He added, however: \u201cWe are open to investments from everybody.\u201d  (Clarifies U.S.-Qatar deal signed in January in paragraph 5.)","293":"FILE PHOTO: Passengers wear protective face masks as they stand in front of the American Airlines ticketing desk at Josep Tarradellas Barcelona-El Prat Airport, after further cases of coronavirus were confirmed in Barcelona, Spain March 12, 2020.

The phase-out onboard its planes will begin in November, with plastic straws and stirrers to be replaced by environmentally friendly bamboo.  \u201cWe\u2019re cognizant of our impact on the environment and we remain committed to doing our part to sustain the planet for future generations of travelers,\u201d Jill Surdek, vice president of flight service, said in a statement.
