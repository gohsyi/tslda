The chain will work in a joint venture with Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group to test facial recognition check-ins at two China hotels this month, the firms said on Wednesday, with ambitions for a global rollout later.  China is spearheading the use of facial recognition for everything from helping control major live events to ordering fast-food, but also bolstering a growing domestic surveillance system that has raised fears among human rights activists of privacy being invaded.  The joint venture said the new technology would help guests jump queues and cut the check-in process to less than a minute, compared to at least three minutes at a normal counter.  Chinese guests will need to scan their IDs, take a photo and input contact details on an automated machine, the firms said. The device will then dispense room key cards after verifying identities and booking information.  The pilot will roll out at two Marriott hotels in Hangzhou and Sanya on the tropical island province of Hainan.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Starwood Hotels, now owned by Marriott, four years ago became the first U.S. hotel company to sign a deal with Cuba since the 1959 revolution amid the normalization of relations pursued by former President Barack Obama.  But the administration of President Donald Trump has unraveled that detente, tightening the decades-old U.S. trade embargo on Cuba and saying it wants to pressure the island into democratic reform and to stop supporting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.  The approach could help Trump bolster support in the large Cuban-American community in Florida, a state considered vital to his re-election chances in November.  A company spokeswoman said the U.S. Treasury Department had ordered the company to wind down its operation of the Four Points Sheraton in Havana by Aug. 31. It would also not be allowed to open other hotels it had been preparing to run.  A U.S. Treasury Department spokesperson said it could not comment on specific licensing matters, but that the administration aimed to prevent Cuba\u2019s military from using revenue from tourism to \u201coppress its own people\u201d,  The Four Points Sheraton in Havana, like swaths of the tourism sector and economy at large, is controlled by the commercial arm of the Cuban military.  \u201cIn 2017, Trump promised he would not disrupt existing contracts U.S. businesses had with Cuba,\u201d wrote William LeoGrande, a Cuba expert at American University in Washington, on Twitter. \u201cPromise made, promise broken.\u201d  The news comes two days after the U.S. State Department expanded its list of Cuban entities with which Americans are banned from doing business to include the military-owned financial corporation that handles U.S. remittances to Cuba.  U.S. sanctions have further crippled an economy already struggling with a decline in aid from leftist ally Venezuela and the end of hard-currency generating Cuban medical missions in Brazil and elsewhere.

Sorenson said that Marriott's partnership with ecommerce company Alibaba BABA.N had driven a \"few million\" new members to sign up for its loyalty programs in China since the deal was inked in 2017.  Marriott generates roughly 55 percent of its business from loyalty members.  The company said on Tuesday it plans to expand its presence in India where it has more than 50 signed projects in its pipeline.  The Bethesda, Maryland-based company expects to introduce three new brands, namely Moxy, Delta and Tribute in the coming few years in India, which is its second biggest market in Asia after China.

REUTERS\/Heinz-Peter Bader  The travel industry has been facing mounting problems after weeks of cancellations focused on Asia, with online travel agency Booking Holdings BKNG.O forecasting a wider-than-usual range for its first-quarter outlook, citing uncertain travel demand and flagging a significant hit to the period from the virus.  Hawaiian Airlines HA.O has suspended flights between the international airports at Honolulu and Incheon, South Korea beginning March 2 through April 30, citing a spike in COVID-19 cases in the Asian country. (bit.ly\/2HV9Nno)  The United States told Americans on Tuesday to begin preparing for the coronavirus to spread within the country as outbreaks in Iran, South Korea and Italy escalated, triggering concerns of a hit to global travel demand.  \u201cDue to the uncertainty regarding the duration and extent of the coronavirus outbreak, Marriott cannot fully estimate the financial impact from the virus, which could be material to first-quarter and full-year 2020 results,\u201d Marriott said, adding that room additions in 2020 could also be delayed as a result of the outbreak.  Marriott, which is currently facing low occupancy rates in the Asia Pacific region, has also issued cancellation fee waivers for guests affected by the virus outbreak in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan until March 15.  U.S. airlines and hotels are extending options for customers to rebook travel to a growing list of countries, including Italy, as coronavirus cases spike beyond China and spark fears of a global pandemic.  \u201cIt is not possible to predict where, and to what degree, outbreaks of the coronavirus will disrupt travel patterns,\u201d Booking said in its earnings release.  JetBlue which only flies in the United States, the Caribbean and Latin America, became the first U.S. airline to offer waivers for all travel on Wednesday, announcing it would suspend change and cancellation fees for new flight bookings between Feb. 27 and March 11 this year.  \u201cWhile authorities have not issued any travel restrictions to the locations we fly, we want to give our customers some peace of mind that we are ready to support them should the situation change,\u201d JetBlue said in a statement.  Marriott reported a quarterly profit above analyst estimates on Wednesday as occupancy and room prices in North America inched higher. The company also forecast revenue per available room growth \u2014 a measure of a hotel\u2019s financial performance \u2014 to be between flat and up 2% in 2020.  The hotel operator said it expects 2020 earnings, excluding the impact of the virus, to be between $6.30 and $6.53 per share. Analysts were expecting $6.47 per share, according to Refinitiv data.","24":"RIYADH (Reuters) - Marriott International expects to attract $2 billion of investment in Saudi Arabia in the next four years by almost doubling the number of hotel rooms it operates there, an executive said on Monday.

REUTERS\/Andrew Kelly  The kingdom aims to boost domestic and international tourism in its drive to diversify the economy away from oil exports. It is has set a target of $46.6 billion in spending by local and foreign tourists in 2020, up from $27.9 billion in 2015.  Alex Kyriakidis, Marriott\u2019s president and managing director for the Middle East and Africa, told Reuters his firm would expand the number of rooms at its hotels to about 12,500 in the next four years from almost 6,800 now.  Building now underway on the almost 6,000 new rooms would cost $2 billion, he said in an interview, adding the company would operate 52 hotels once work was completed, up from 23 now.  The company operates the Marriott, Ritz Carlton, Le Meridien and Sheraton brands in Saudi Arabia, among others.  Riyadh\u2019s Ritz-Carlton Hotel reopened this month, more than three months after it was converted into a temporary prison for members of Saudi Arabia\u2019s business and political elite detained in an anti-corruption purge.  He said Ritz Carlton\u2019s temporary closure did not hurt the group\u2019s operations in the kingdom, adding that the crackdown on corruption should reassure investors.  He said domestic tourism still accounted for most visitors.  The Saudi authorities have said they would issue tourist visas to foreigners this year, but details have not been disclosed.  To attract visitors, Saudi Arabia said it would develop resorts on some 50 islands off the Red Sea coast and an entertainment city south of Riyadh featuring golf courses, car racing tracks and a theme park.","25":"April 14 (Reuters) - Marriott International Inc:  * MARRIOTT FILES FOR POTENTIAL SERIES EE NOTES OFFERING; SIZE NOT DISCLOSED - SEC FILING Source text: (bit.ly\/3cto5cn) Further company coverage:","26":"Feb 15 (Reuters) - Marriott International Inc:  * MARRIOTT FILES FOR POTENTIAL MIXED SHELF OFFERING; SIZE NOT DSICLOSED - SEC FILING Source text: (bit.ly\/2BZjwIk) Further company coverage:","27":"(Reuters) - Marriott International Chief Executive Officer Arne Sorenson, who was undergoing treatment for pancreatic cancer, has died, the company said on Tuesday.

The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages for loss of control of personal data, automatically includes guests who made a reservation for one of the former Starwood brand hotels - including Sheraton Hotels & Resorts and St. Regis hotels - before Sept. 10, 2018.  Bryant is represented by law firm Hausfeld and the case is funded by Harbour Litigation.  A London-based spokeswoman for Marriott said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have a comment to make at this time.\u201d  Around seven million British guest records were compromised by the hack, according to the UK Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), which last year proposed to fine Marriott 99.2 million pounds ($133 million).

The lawsuit said that 189 Marriott properties worldwide impose fees ranging from $9 to $95 a day.  Resort fees, sometimes called destination or amenity fees, are displayed separately from hotel room prices. The charges are often lumped with taxes, giving the impression they are government imposed, and only become evident to consumers near the end of the booking process, the agency said.  The practice has emerged as consumers increasingly comparison shop on travel websites. Hotels attract travelers by advertising lower room rates that do not include the fees.  \u201cBy charging these fees, hotels can increase profits without appearing to raise prices. Over the past decade, Marriott has increased its use of resort fees,\u201d the attorney general said.

(Reporting by Clare Roth;)","43":"(Reuters) - U.S. hotel operator Marriott MAR.O missed already lowered estimates for first-quarter profit by a huge margin on Monday, as bookings plunged due to the coronavirus-led lockdowns that kept a quarter of its hotels closed.  In line with Holiday Inn-owner IHG\u2019s announcement last week, the company said its bookings in Greater China improved in April as the world\u2019s second-largest economy gradually reopened for business.  Marriott\u2019s shares, down 42% this year already, fell as much as 6.5% as the company reported a 90% slump in the industry\u2019s closely watched revenue per available room indicator in April.  \u201cApril seems to have defined the bottom (for Marriott),\u201d Chief Executive Officer Arne Sorenson said, as the company was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic that led thousands of people to cancel bookings and stay at home to contain the spread of the deadly virus.  Soreson said demand was, however, starting to crawl back. \u201cAs restrictions are released, I think the trend line now is towards more (hotel) openings, not towards more closings.\u201d  Marriott, which reported a 22.5% decline in first-quarter revenue per available room, would be adding thousands more hotel rooms in over the next year or two, as they have already been under development.  The company\u2019s worldwide development pipeline totaled nearly 3,035 hotels with about 516,000 rooms. More than 230,000 rooms in the pipeline were under construction as of the end of the first quarter.  Marriott is cutting or deferring around 45% of its earlier 2020 spending forecast of between $700 million and $800 million, but any cutbacks in new investments would only begin to be visible in 2022, SunTrust Robinson analyst Patrick Scholes said.  Sorenson said occupancy at Marriott hotels in Greater China was just over 30% presently, up from less than 10% in mid-February 2020, and said that was evidence of the resilience of travel demand.  Marriott\u2019s total debt jumped by about 12% to $12.23 billion in the quarter and the company said it had net liquidity of about $4.3 billion as of May 8.

The company closed the Starwood deal in September 2016.  Marriott said for 327 million guests, compromised data could include passport details, phone numbers and email addresses. For some others, it could include credit card information.  Marriott said it first found out about the breach after an internal security tool sent an alert on Sept. 8.  \u201cWe\u2019ve opened an investigation into the Marriott data breach. Additionally, under New York law, Marriott was required to provide notification to our office upon discovering the breach; they have not done so as of yet,\u201d said Amy Spitalnick,  Communications Director and Senior Policy Advisor, Office of the New York Attorney General.  Marriott said it would inform affected guests about the breach, starting Friday, and that it had reported it to law enforcement and regulatory authorities.  Several companies have suffered data hacks in recent years. The breach could cost Marriott hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs.  Yahoo said last year all of its three billion accounts were hacked in a 2013 data theft. Attorneys had said the breach sharply increased the legal exposure of its new owner, Verizon Communications Inc.  Altaba Inc, as Yahoo came to be known after Verizon bought it, said it expected to pay a total of $47 million in litigation expenses to settle related cases.

FILE PHOTO - Logo of Marriott hotel is seen in Vienna, Austria April 9, 2018. REUTERS\/Heinz-Peter Bader  Marriott said last week that a hack that began four years ago had exposed the records of up to 500 million customers in its Starwood hotels reservation system.  Private investigators looking into the breach have found hacking tools, techniques and procedures previously used in attacks attributed to Chinese hackers, said three sources who were not authorized to discuss the company\u2019s private probe into the attack.  That suggests that Chinese hackers may have been behind a campaign designed to collect information for use in Beijing\u2019s espionage efforts and not for financial gain, two of the sources said.  While China has emerged as the lead suspect in the case, the sources cautioned it was possible somebody else was behind the hack because other parties had access to the same hacking tools, some of which have previously been posted online.  Identifying the culprit is further complicated by the fact that investigators suspect multiple hacking groups may have simultaneously been inside Starwood\u2019s computer networks since 2014, said one of the sources.  If investigators confirm that China was behind the attack, that could complicate already tense relations between Washington and Beijing, amid an ongoing tariff dispute and U.S. accusations of Chinese espionage and the theft of trade secrets.  \u201cChina firmly opposes all forms of cyber attack and cracks down on them in accordance with law,\u201d Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang told Reuters.\u201dIf offered evidence, the relevant Chinese departments will carry out investigations according to law.\u201d  Marriott spokeswoman Connie Kim declined to comment, saying \u201cWe\u2019ve got nothing to share,\u201d when asked about involvement of Chinese hackers.  Marriott disclosed the hack on Friday, prompting U.S. and UK regulators to quickly launch probes into the case.  Compromised customer data included names, passport numbers, addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and email addresses. A small percentage of accounts included scrambled payment card data, said Kim.  Marriott acquired Starwood in 2016 for $13.6 billion, including the Sheraton, Westin, W Hotels, St. Regis, Aloft, Le Meridien, Tribute, Four Points and Luxury Collection hotel brands, forming the world\u2019s largest hotel operator.  The hack began in 2014, shortly after an attack on the U.S. government\u2019s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) compromised sensitive data on tens of millions of employees, including application forms for security clearances.  White House National Security advisor John Bolton recently told reporters he believed Beijing was behind the OPM hack, a claim first made by the United States in 2015.  Beijing has strongly denied those charges and also refuted charges that it was behind other hacks.  Former senior FBI official Robert Anderson told Reuters that the Marriott case looked similar to hacks that the Chinese government was conducting in 2014 as part of its intelligence operations.  \u201cThink of the depth of knowledge they could now have about travel habits or who happened to be in a certain city at the same time as another person,\u201d said Anderson, who served as FBI executive assistant director until 2015.  \u201cIt fits with how the Chinese intelligence services think about things. It\u2019s all very long range,\u201d said Anderson, who was not involved in investigating the Marriott case and is now a principal with Chertoff Group.  Michael Sussmann, a former senior Department of Justice official for its computer crimes section, said that the long duration of the campaign was an indicator that the hackers were seeking data for intelligence and not information to use in cyber crime schemes.  \u201cOne clue pointing to a government attacker is the amount of time the intruders were working quietly inside the network,\u201d he said. \u201cPatience is a virtue for spies, but not for criminals trying to steal credit card numbers.\u201d  FBI representatives could not immediately be reached for comment on the evidence linking the attack to China. A spokesperson said on Friday that the agency was looking into the attack, but declined to elaborate.","67":"","68":"LONDON, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Marriott International Inc , the world\u2019s largest hotel operator, is facing a London class action brought by millions of former hotel guests demanding compensation after their personal data was hacked in one of the largest data breaches in history.  Martin Bryant, founder of technology and media consultancy Big Revolution, is leading the claim for English and Welsh-domiciled guests after more than 300 million customer records from Marriott\u2019s global database, potentially including passport and credit card details, were hacked between 2014 and 2018.  \u201cI hope this case will raise awareness of the value of our personal data, result in fair compensation ... and also serve notice to other data owners that they must hold our data responsibly,\u201d he said in a statement.  The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages for loss of control of personal data, automatically includes guests who made a reservation for one of the former Starwood brand hotels - including Sheraton Hotels & Resorts and St. Regis hotels - before Sept. 10, 2018.  Bryant is represented by law firm Hausfeld and the case is funded by Harbour Litigation.  Around seven million UK guest records were involved, according to the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), which last year proposed a 99.2 million pound ($133 million) fine over the breach.  A London-based spokeswoman for Marriott was not immediately available for comment.  Marriott announced in 2018 that hackers had accessed its Starwood hotels reservation database and notified the FBI.  \u201cWe fell short of what our guests deserve,\u201d Chief Executive Arne Sorenson said at the time.  Attorneys filed a lawsuit in a Maryland federal court within hours of the disclosure. Others followed suit in the U.S. and Canada.  The London class action has been filed in the High Court after a landmark Court of Appeal decision last October that a collective action could be served against Internet giant Google over alleged unlawful tracking of iPhone users in 2011 and 2012 through third party cookies.  Google is appealing.","69":"(Repeats to widen distribution)  BENGALURU, April 3 (Reuters) - Marriott International Inc is looking to lower the commissions it pays to online travel agencies starting with Expedia Group Inc when it renegotiates its contract with the company later this year, Chief Executive Officer Arne Sorenson said on Tuesday.  Online travel agencies, already dealing with tight margins, are facing more pressure from hotel chains seeking to shift customers to book directly on their web and mobile platforms by providing incentives like free wifi and discounts.  \u201cWe would certainly like to pay less. We will have to see how the negotiations go,\u201d Sorenson told Reuters on the sidelines of a press conference in Bengaluru.  Marriott will be renegotiating contracts with major online bookers for the first time since its merger with Starwood Hotels in September 2016 and the lower commissions could likely boost Marriott\u2019s revenue per room, but may hurt the travel agents.  Expedia\u2019s would be the first major renewal with the current deal expiring later this year. The company will renegotiate its contract with Booking Holdings Inc sometime in 2019.  The Marriott chief was in India\u2019s global outsourcing capital Bengaluru to open the company\u2019s 100th hotel in the country, the Sheraton Grand Bengaluru Whitefield.  Marriott currently pays a commission of upwards of 10 percent to online travel agencies, which currently contribute about 12 percent to Marriott\u2019s overall bookings.  The bulk of company\u2019s bookings come from direct channels, including its mobile application and website.  \u201cWe have seen significant growth in all digital channels...What has declined a bit would be travel agents, in part because people are moving online and doing things themselves,\u201d Sorenson said.  The world\u2019s biggest hotel chain is benefiting from strong economic growth in Asia Pacific region, led by China.  Sorenson said that Marriott\u2019s partnership with ecommerce company Alibaba had driven a \u201cfew million\u201d new members to sign up for its loyalty programs in China since the deal was inked in 2017.  Marriott generates roughly 55 percent of its business from loyalty members.  The company said on Tuesday it plans to expand its presence in India where it has more than 50 signed projects in its pipeline.  The Bethesda, Maryland-based company expects to introduce three new brands, namely Moxy, Delta and Tribute in the coming few years in India, which is its second biggest market in Asia after China.  The growth in India would raise its room inventory to more than 30,000 units, up from about 22,000 currently, Marriott said without providing a timeline.  Expedia\u2019s shares were down nearly 1 pct at $106 in late afternoon trading on Tuesday.

Marriott has been criticized recently by activist investor Jonathan Litt who, according to media reports, has urged the company to consider culling its 30 brands to better align itself with competitors such as Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.  Opening of 1,700 hotels by 2021 will average more than 500 hotels per annum, adding between 275,000 and 295,000 rooms over the next three years, and potentially generating $400 million in fee revenue in 2021.

During the three-year period, the company plans to pay $1.9 billion to $2 billion in dividends and buy back shares worth $7.6 billion to $9 billion, Marriott said.  The hotel chain had come under scrutiny after it was hit by a massive data breach involving up to 383 million guests in its Starwood hotels reservation system, which was disclosed in last November.  Chief Executive Officer Arne Sorenson earlier this month apologized before a U.S. Senate panel and vowed to protect against future attacks.

Last month, Marriott missed Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter revenue and forecast a lower-than-expected full-year profit, blaming slowing demand in North America, its largest market.

Analysts expect a wider rollout of COVID-19 vaccines later this year to first aid a rebound in leisure travel, leaving business travel-reliant hotel chains including Marriott and smaller rival Hilton Worldwide struggling for longer.  Marriott said that the pace of bookings for its group business, which makes up about 20% of its annual room nights, has improved in the second half of 2021 to being down between 25% and 30%.  \u201cOn the group front, (cancellations) have slowed for the second half of 2021, and they are at normal levels for 2022,\u201d said Stephanie Linnartz, group president, consumer operations.  Earlier this week, Hilton also forecast an improvement in the group business in the latter half of the year.  Marriott\u2019s results come days after the death of its Chief Executive Officer Arne Sorenson. The company is expected to announce a new CEO in the next two weeks.  Its fourth-quarter revenue plunged 60% to $2.17 billion, missing analysts\u2019 estimates of $2.40 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.  Quarterly net loss was $164 million, compared with a profit of $279 million a year earlier.  The company posted an annual net loss of $267 million, its first since 2009.  Shares of Marriott, which owns the St. Regis and the Ritz-Carlton hotel chains, ended up 0.5% at $131.98. The stock has fallen about 9% in the past 12 months.","86":"FILE PHOTO: Logo of Marriott hotel is seen in Vienna, Austria April 9, 2018. REUTERS\/Heinz-Peter Bader  (Reuters) - Marriott International MAR.O said on Tuesday bookings in Greater China were improving steadily in April as authorities lifted some coronavirus-led travel curbs, even as it forecast a 60% decline in its March total revenue per available room.  Shares of the company, which owns the Ritz-Carlton and St. Regis luxury hotel brands, rose as much as 6.7% to $83.30 in morning trading.  Marriott said occupancy in Greater China rose to roughly 20% in the first week of April, underpinned by a recovery in leisure demand, as restrictions on movement and quarantine measures ease.  The hotel industry has been hurt by a jump in booking cancellations due to coronavirus-driven lockdowns, forcing Marriott and smaller rivals Hilton Worldwide HLT.N and Hyatt Hotels H.N to abandon their outlooks.  But with the world\u2019s second-largest economy slowly reopening for business, the number of closed Marriott hotels in Greater China fell to just under 20 as of Tuesday, from more than 90 hotels in mid-February, the company said.  \u201cWe believe leisure demand will likely lead the recovery as businesses are likely to balance travel needs with viable alternatives such as virtual meetings,\u201d Jefferies analyst David Katz wrote in a note.  Marriott, however, said booking trends for the rest of the world have not yet stabilized.  It estimated a 23% drop in first-quarter revenue per available room, a key measure of hotel health, and said it plans to eliminate or delay around 40% of its annual investment spending plan of between $700 million and $800 million.  The company \u201cdoes not expect to see a material improvement (in RevPAR performance) until there is a view that the spread of COVID-19 has moderated and governments have lifted restrictions,\u201d it said.","87":"(Reuters) - Marriott International Inc on Friday reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, as the world\u2019s biggest hotel chain benefited from a lower effective tax rate and higher room prices.  FILE PHOTO: Logo of Marriott hotel is seen in Vienna, Austria April 9, 2018. REUTERS\/Heinz-Peter Bader  An expanding U.S. economy has driven demand for corporate travel, benefiting the owner of Ritz-Carlton and St. Regis luxury hotel brands.  However, an increase in existing tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from 10% on Friday may threaten global economic growth in the quarters ahead, affecting travel demand, analysts have warned.  Marriott said its occupancy rate fell 0.8% in North America, its biggest market, while room prices increased by 2%, resulting in revenue per available room (revPAR) rising 0.8% in the first quarter ended March 31.  RevPAR, a key measure of a hotel\u2019s financial performance, is calculated by multiplying the average daily room rate by occupancy rate.  Asia Pacific, Marriott\u2019s large market outside North America, gained in both occupancy and room rates, with occupancy rising 1.9% and rates increasing by 0.5% in the quarter.  Marriott results, aided by lower taxes, were seen as \u201cunspectacular\u201d by an analyst, who said the numbers were unlikely to cheer the investors.  \u201cDespite these positives, the quarter is likely not enough to push the shares higher in the current market context,\u201d Jefferies analyst David Katz wrote in a note.  Marriott\u2019s worldwide revPAR rose 1.1% in the quarter, driven by a 1.5% increase in room rates. Also, the company reaffirmed its full-year worldwide revPAR forecast between 1% and 3%.  The company raised its full-year 2019 adjusted profit forecast in the range of $5.97 per share to $6.19 per share, from a previous forecast of $5.87 per share to $6.10 per share, partly due to a lower effective tax rate.  On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.41 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.34 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Marriott\u2019s profit beat was helped by a lower tax rate of 13%, against an expected rate of 21%.  Revenue rose marginally to $5.01 billion in the quarter, but was below analysts\u2019 estimates of $5.11 billion.  Shares of the company fell 3% to $131.50 in premarket trading.

The hack began in 2014, a year before Marriott offered to buy Starwood.  The company initially said records of up to 500 million guests were involved and then revised its estimate to up to 383 million in January.  The hotel operator also said that some 25.55 million passport numbers were stolen in the attack on the Starwood Hotels reservation system, 5.25 million of which were stored in plain text.

The company said the partnership will start this summer at Marriott\u2019s select properties and the service will be available by invitation to other hotel chains.  Several media reports had said that Marriott had tested both Apple Inc\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa to select what was best suited for its hotels.  On whether Alexa was chosen over Siri, Marriott said \u201cthis was not a direct comparison with Siri.

This means, for example, that a traveler who searches online for a Marriott in Dallas would not be shown advertising for competing hotels, the Travelpass lawsuit alleges.

The Maryland-based company, which said it could eliminate 1 billion straws and a quarter of a billion stirrers a year, said it would provide alternatives, for example paper straws, to customers upon request.  \u201cRemoving plastic straws is one of the simplest ways our guests can contribute to plastic reduction when staying with us \u2013 something they are increasingly concerned about and are already doing in their own homes,\u201d Arne Sorenson, president and CEO of Marriott International, said in a statement.  The U.N. Environment Programme estimated in its global Clean Seas campaign launched last year that some 8 million tons of plastic is dumped into the ocean every year, damaging the marine eco-system. Although plastic straws represent a relatively small portion of all plastic waste, they are difficult to recycle and often end up in landfills where they decompose at a much slower rate than paper alternatives.  Marriott joins a growing number of hospitality companies that have said they will do away with disposable plastic straws.  Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc said in May it plans to remove plastic straws from 650 of its managed properties by the end of this year.
