FILE PHOTO: Logos of ConocoPhillips are seen in its booth at Gastech, the world's biggest expo for the gas industry, in Chiba, Japan, April 4, 2017. REUTERS\/Toru Hanai  A U.S. district court judge in Houston on Thursday ruled Conoco can depose Citgo as preparation for a court case against PDVSA and others over alleged asset transfers in the Caribbean that Conoco claims were designed to frustrate its efforts to obtain payment under an International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) award.  Citgo declined to comment, citing a policy regarding ongoing litigation.  Conoco is pleased with the court\u2019s decision, spokesman Daren Beaudo said in a statement. The company has not received any payment from PDVSA for the award and will continue to pursue the matter, he added.  The decision is another blow to the Venezuelan oil company, which has struggled to pay creditors as its oil production has fallen to the lowest level in more than three decades.  Conoco alleges state-run PDVSA transferred crude and fuels stored at the Isla refinery and Bullenbay Terminal in Curacao to Citgo to prevent it from seizing the oil to enforce the ICC award, according to its filing with a U.S. district in Houston.  The court filing portrays active and often successful efforts by PDVSA and its subsidiary to defeat Conoco\u2019s bids to seize oil cargoes and other assets. In one case, it claims PDVSA caused Citgo Petroleum to claim ownership of cargoes off Aruba as a way to lift the company\u2019s liens, Conoco said in its June filing.  PDVSA also denied court officers access to some ships docked near Curacao and at least one vessel temporarily disabled its GPS transponder to make a getaway, avoiding seizure, the filing said.  Conoco\u2019s assets in Venezuela were expropriated in 2007, after the late President Hugo Chavez nationalized several oil projects by forcing their conversion into joint ventures controlled by PDVSA.  Conoco and Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N left Venezuela after they were unable to reach agreements with PDVSA.  As part of the arbitration award, Conoco was able to place liens on assets owned or rented in Curacao, Aruba, Bonaire and St. Eustatius, including inventories held at refineries and terminals, and cargoes aboard vessels.  But those efforts have been hindered by local groups and courts. A Curacao court provisionally lifted Conoco\u2019s claims on the Isla refinery in May after public utilities and the island\u2019s government petitioned the court, citing their need for the fuels.","1":"(Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas producer ConocoPhillips withdrew a request to extend flaring permits at 41 of its sites in West Texas, saying it no longer needed them as operational improvements had reduced the need for flaring events.  FILE PHOTO: The logo for ConocoPhillips is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., January 13, 2020. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Flaring, the practice of deliberately burning unwanted gas, has become a concern for environmentalists and investors on fears that it exacerbates climate change by releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.  ConocoPhillips continues to take steps to reduce flaring in Permian Basin\u2019s Goldsmith area by improving operational procedures, including shut-ins, John Roper, director of the company\u2019s media relations and crisis communications, told Reuters on Friday.  \u201cThese efforts have reduced the need for flaring events and eliminated the need to pursue the RRC (Railroad Commission of Texas) applications,\u201d Roper added.  The RRC confirmed that ConocoPhillips had withdrawn its request in a letter dated Sept. 2.  In October, the company had applied for a two-year permit to cover unplanned flaring at its Goldsmith facilities.  A report by the Environmental Integrity Project, a non-profit organization, citing state records, said the 41 Conoco sites burned 1.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas in 2018-2019, releasing more than 1,262 tons of sulfur dioxide.  Although companies have to apply for permits to burn unwanted gas, Texas currently allows producers to do so for six months and routinely issues waivers after the six months expires.  The head of the RRC said in June that Texas as early as this fall could tighten some flaring rules.  Recommendations from an industry panel included halving the number of days producers can routinely burn unwanted gas without going to the RRC for a hearing to 90 from 180.","2":"April 26 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips:  * REPORTS FIRST-QUARTER 2018 RESULTS; STRONG PERFORMANCE ON DELIVERING DISCIPLINED PLAN  * Q1 ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE $0.96 EXCLUDING ITEMS  * Q1 EARNINGS PER SHARE $0.75  * QTRLY PRODUCTION EXCLUDING LIBYA 1,224 THOUSAND BARRELS OF OIL EQUIVALENT PER DAY (MBOED), A DECREASE OF 360 MBOED  * QTRLY TOTAL REALIZED PRICE WAS $50.49 PER BARREL OF OIL EQUIVALENT (BOE), COMPARED WITH $36.18 PER BOE IN Q1 OF 2017  * INCREASED FULL-YEAR 2018 PRODUCTION GUIDANCE TO 1,200 TO 1,240 MBOED  * SEES SECOND-QUARTER 2018 PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO BE 1,170 TO 1,210 MBOED  * COMPANY\u2019S 2018 CAPITAL GUIDANCE OF $5.5 BILLION IS UNCHANGED  * COMPANY INCREASED FULL-YEAR 2018 PRODUCTION GUIDANCE TO 1,200 TO 1,240 MBOED  * ON TRACK FOR FULL-YEAR SHARE REPURCHASES OF $2 BILLION  * QTRLY TOTAL REVENUE AND OTHER INCOME $8,961 MILLION VERSUS $7,771 MILLION REPORTED LAST YEAR  * Q1 REVENUE VIEW $8.84 BILLION -- THOMSON REUTERS I\/B\/E\/S Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","3":"(Reuters) - ConocoPhillips issued a muted annual outlook on Tuesday, expecting a hit from weaker oil demand growth due to the coronavirus outbreak and disruptions at its operations in Malaysia and Libya.  The logo for ConocoPhillips is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., January 13, 2020. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Shares of the company, which also reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter profit, fell as much as 3.6% and were at the bottom of the S&P Energy Index.  On a post-earnings call with analysts, ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Officer Ryan Lance warned that oil demand growth could be hit by 100,000 to 200,000 barrel per day this year due to the outbreak of the flu-like virus in China.  Lance expects a build up in oil storage in the United States and in non-OPEC countries to pressure crude prices. However, there will be a drawdown later in the year, he added.  ConocoPhillips also said it was tapering down production in Libya and expects no output \u201cfairly soon\u201d, following a force majeure between ConocoPhillips and the country\u2019s National Oil Corp (NOC).  In January, two major oilfields in southwest Libya began shutting down after military forces closed a pipeline. NOC declared force majeure on crude loadings from the Sharara and El Feel oilfields, Reuters reported then.  ConocoPhillips cut its 2020 production forecast range to 1.23 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) to 1.27 million boepd, excluding Libya, from its prior range of 1.24 million boepd to 1.31 million boepd, expecting a hit from a third-party pipeline outage at the Kebabangan field in Malaysia.  It, however, maintained plans to spend $6.5 billion to $6.7 billion.  Analysts on average were expecting capital expenditure of $6.48 billion and production at 1.287 million boepd.  \u201cGiven COP\u2019s consistent outperformance for the last two years, guidance slightly below consensus expectations will probably slightly tarnish the company\u2019s gold reputation,\u201d Scotiabank analyst Paul Cheng said.  ConocoPhillips\u2019 net income fell 61.5% for the fourth quarter, partly hit by impairment charges of $386 million related to the pending sale of properties in Colorado.  Excluding items, profit was 76 cents per share, missing the average analyst estimate of 80 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The quarterly profit was hit by a 11.3% plunge in prices for the company\u2019s oil and gas as well as a 2% decline in production, excluding Libya.  The company also boosted its share buyback program by $10 billion at a time when investors have been pushing energy companies to prioritize shareholder returns over production growth.","4":"BRISBANE (Reuters) - Liquefied natural gas (LNG) producers ConocoPhillips and Woodside Petroleum expect prices for the commodity to pick up in the short term, pulling away from three-year lows that were hit after a mild northern hemisphere winter.  Flags fly outside ConocoPhillips offices in Houston, Texas, U.S., April 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Loren Elliott  But the chief executive at Australia\u2019s Woodside, Peter Coleman, said he was worried about companies approving new LNG projects without lining up long-term contracts, potentially weighing on prices when they start producing in the mid-2020s.  In the near term, ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Ryan Lance said growing demand would soak up excess supply in the market.  \u201cLNG prices are pretty weak right now, but we believe it\u2019s a short-term phenomenon,\u201d Lance said at an industry conference in Australia.  \u201cWe just came out of a mild northern hemisphere winter. We believe that demand growth will absorb the current supply excess that exists in the market today,\u201d he said.  ConocoPhillips operates the 3.7 million tonnes a year Darwin LNG plant in northern Australia and the 9 million tonnes a year east coast Australia Pacific LNG plant.  Woodside\u2019s Coleman does not expect the current weak prices to affect the timing of the company\u2019s Browse gas project off northwest Australia, for which the company aims to make a final investment decision in late 2020.  \u201cWe always thought 2019, 2020 would be difficult trading years with respect to the spot market,\u201d he said.  Coleman said that timetable for a final investment decision was \u201csafe\u201d as Woodside\u2019s partners include LNG buyers Mitsui & Co, Mitsubishi Corp and PetroChina.  \u201cFor us, we\u2019re not going to be competing with our partners in Browse for sales anywhere, so that gives us some comfort we can get it away,\u201d he said.  But what could weigh on the market in the mid-2020s is that a number of new LNG projects elsewhere could go ahead without having pre-sold all their volumes, as Shell has done with a project in Canada.  \u201cThat is a concern for me, because that signals ... that everybody\u2019s seeing that same thing that we\u2019ve been talking about, which is that the market will start to tighten in 2023-24, and they\u2019re just holding back selling their volumes until the market tightens,\u201d he said.  \u201cIf too many projects do that, of course, there\u2019ll never be a tightening because everybody will be trying to get in at the same time.\u201d  FINAL DECISION  ConocoPhillips expects to make a final investment decision later this year or in early 2020 on whether to develop the Barossa gas field to fill the Darwin LNG plant when supply runs out around 2022 from the Bayu Undan field in the Timor Sea.  Its partners in Barossa, which lies about 300 km (186 miles) north of Darwin, are South Korea\u2019s SK E&S Co and Santos.  Lance said LNG buyers are taking advantage of weak spot LNG prices, now at three-year lows below $5 per million British thermal units (mmBTU), to demand shorter term contracts and more pricing latitude from suppliers.  \u201cIt\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market today,\u201d Lance said.  \u201cAs for the long term, we expect the current oversupply to tighten by the mid-2020s,\u201d he said.  He said producers would need to line up longer-term contracts from buyers to be able to fund construction projects.","5":"(Corrects total North American output cuts to 729,000 bpd, not 854,000 in third paragraph)  HOUSTON\/BANGALORE, April 16 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips said on Thursday it would slash spending and cut U.S. oil output by about 30% of this year\u2019s target, the largest cut so far by a major shale producer to deal with an unprecedented drop in oil demand.  U.S. oil and gas producers have cut expenses, dismissed tens of thousands of workers and shut-in well as coronavirus-related lockdowns have curtailed travel and closed businesses, knocking down crude prices by 60% this year.  ConocoPhillips will reduce planned North American output by 225,000 barrels per day (bpd), with the largest cut in its shale output, the company said. Overall, U.S. producers have chopped 729,000 bpd from their goals, according to a Reuters tally of announced cuts.  The cuts are quickly outpacing even the most recent U.S. government forecasts. By December, the reductions could lop off 2.15 million bpd from pre-coronavirus targets, consultancy Rystad Energy said on Wednesday. That would put the United States slightly above the curbs sought by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries this month.  \u201cWe are just not going to sell our crude for these kinds of prices,\u201d ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Ryan Lance on a call with analysts. \u201cI would expect you\u2019re going to see a lot more of this,\u201d Lance said.  OPEC and its allies, including Russia, this month pledged to cut their May production by roughly 9.7 million bpd to halt an oil glut. They have called on the United States, Norway, Brazil and others to take steps to curb production to support their own energy industries.  The U.S. government cannot mandate cuts by private firms, but rapidly filling U.S. pipelines and storage tanks, combined with falling demand for oil by U.S. refiners, has ConocoPhillips and other producers moving to shut in wells.  Other U.S. producers including Chevron Corp, Occidental Petroleum Corp, and Diamondback Energy Inc have whacked spending. The top U.S. oil company, Exxon Mobil Corp, this month slashed its spending 30%. Overall, oil companies have pulled back 2020 spending plans by an average of 22%.  ConocoPhillips said in addition to cutting 125,000 bpd from its mainland U.S. operations, it will cut production in Canada by about 100,000 bpd due to low prices.  The company last month halved its $3 billion-a-year share buyback program and on Wednesday suspended purchases altogether. It has emphasized buybacks as its primary means of rewarding shareholders, but will continue to pay a cash dividend.  Conoco is reducing its 2020 spending budget by 35% from its original $6.6 billion target. The new budget is $4.3 billion, it said.  U.S. and Canadian producers, generally burdened with higher costs than some of their global competitors, have slashed spending overall by more than $37 billion, or around 30%.  Conoco said it will not cut production in Alaska, but will focus cuts on other North American fields.  It does not plan to complete any more wells in its Texas and North Dakota this year and is halting all hydraulic fracturing, said Matt Fox, chief operating officer, the final step to completing new wells.  Shares, which fell 2.9% to $31.27 on Thursday, have lost half their value so far this year.

If accepted, the annulment request would halt enforcement of the award over the 2007 loss of Conoco\u2019s projects in the South American country. It would follow a March decision by the World Bank\u2019s International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) to impose the largest arbitration award against Venezuela.  Jose Ignacio Hernandez, whom Guaido has tapped as a special prosecutor, told Reuters his team separately has challenged the amount of the ICSID award, claiming \u201cthe methodology to determine the compensation was errant.\u201d  Conoco would see no merit in a request for \u201cannulment or rectification\u201d and would \u201cstrongly defend\u201d against such requests, company spokesman Daren Beaudo said.  George Kahale, a U.S. attorney who represented the Venezuelan government before the World Bank tribunal, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Venezuela\u2019s information ministry also had no immediate response to a request for comment.  An annulment would be a boost to Guaido, who in January invoked a constitutional provision to assume an interim presidency. Backed by the United States and dozens of other countries, Guaido argues President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s 2018 re-election was illegitimate.  Hernandez has been assigned to protect Venezuela\u2019s assets abroad from possible seizure by creditors.  Cash-strapped Venezuela has balked at paying in other arbitration cases. Conoco has used legal seizures of Venezuelan oil assets to enforce earlier claims. Other creditors are attempting to seize shares in U.S. refiner Citgo Petroleum, Venezuela\u2019s prize overseas asset, to collect on debts.  It was unclear if Guaido\u2019s representatives have standing to challenge the award since the World Bank has not recognized Guaido. An ICSID spokesman said the body was not in a position to provide any further information on the case.  David Malpass, the newly named president of the World Bank, said last week that recognition would be up to its shareholders.  Hernandez said Guaido\u2019s legal representation \u201ccannot be questioned.\u201d  Last month, a U.S. judge ruled that Guaido\u2019s representatives could present arguments in a court battle with Canadian mining company Crystallex, which is pursuing Citgo to collect on an arbitration award in compensation for Venezuela\u2019s expropriation of a gold mining project.  Venezuela\u2019s nationalization wave, led by late President Hugo Chavez as part of his Socialist project, led to more than 20 international arbitration claims, which remain mostly unpaid.

FILE PHOTO: Ruins of ancestral Pueblo cliff dwellings at Butler Wash in Bears Ears National Monument near Blanding, Utah, U.S., October 27, 2017. REUTERS\/Andrew Cullen  The development is the latest in a string of legal headaches for President Donald Trump\u2019s government as it seeks to roll back regulation on industry.  William Perry Pendley, the BLM\u2019s deputy director for programs and policy, served unlawfully as the agency\u2019s director for more than 400 days because he was not confirmed by the Senate as required by law, according to the ruling last week by U.S. District Judge Brian Morris in Montana.  The BLM is an agency of the Department of Interior and oversees nearly 250 million acres of public lands.  Morris said \u201cany \u2018function or duty\u2019 of the BLM Director that has been performed by Pendley would have no force and effect and must be set aside.\u201d He gave attorneys 10 days to list which decisions by Pendley should be impacted.  Pendley helped finalize numerous \u201cResource Management Plans\u201d guiding how large swathes of federal lands are used and developed, including those for two Utah national monuments that Trump shrank soon after taking office - Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante.  He also helped finalize an RMP covering a ConocoPhillips oil and gas project in Wyoming and a plan that ended a moratorium on oil and gas leases in California.  Pendley\u2019s nomination as BLM director was withdrawn by Trump earlier this month. Pendley is still serving as the bureau\u2019s deputy director of policy and programs even though the judge\u2019s ruling barred him from performing the duties of agency head.  ConocoPhillips spokesman John Roper said the company would not \u201cspeculate as to what actions may or may not be taken by courts or regulators.\u201d  Calling the ruling \u201ca tsunami,\u201d National Audubon Society attorney Nada Culver said \u201cthe court\u2019s reasoning makes it pretty clear that a lot of the activities that Mr. Pendley has been involved in have now been invalidated.\u201d  Department of Interior Solicitor Dan Jorjani called Morris\u2019 ruling \u201cerroneous\u201d and said the department would appeal.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips COP.N on Wednesday forecast a smaller-than-expected quarterly adjusted loss and said it would resume buying back its shares after a historic collapse in crude prices forced the U.S. oil and gas producer to halt the program in April.  Oil companies were forced to slash dividends, halt buybacks and curtail production earlier this year as the COIVD-19 crisis hammered energy demand, sending U.S. crude futures below $0 a barrel for the first time in April.  ConocoPhillips said it plans to resume share repurchases of $1 bln in the fourth quarter.  The company estimated an adjusted loss in the range of $210 million to $260 million for the third quarter, compared with analysts\u2019 estimates of a $243.8 million loss, according to Refinitiv IBES data.  It also forecast quarterly production between 1.05 and 1.07 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), including net curtailments of about 90,000 boepd. ConocoPhillips had reported output of 1.32 million boepd, excluding Libya, in the year-ago quarter.  The company said it had fully restored production in the lower 48 U.S. states, Alaska and Canada by the end of the third quarter.  It estimated average realized prices to be $30 to $32 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe), well below the $47.07 per boe it earned a year earlier.

Conoco will spend more on Alaska and Canada than before in the next year, while keeping expenses in continental United States, which includes the costly and crowded Permian Basin, largely unchanged.  Pipelines in the basin are running at full capacity, while unprecedented drilling has resulted in labor shortage.  Conoco said it will spend $1.2 billion on Alaska from its total capital expenditure of $6.1 billion in 2019, partly a result of a recently sanctioned oil project there. In 2018, the company expects to spend less than $1 billion in the region.  Meanwhile, Hess said the lion\u2019s share of its $2.9 billion capital expenditure in 2019 will be used for exploration in Guyana and in the Bakken shale region of eastern Montana and western North Dakota.  The company\u2019s spending in Guyana largely focuses on production from its offshore discoveries in partnership with Exxon Mobil that now total more than 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent per day (boep\/d).  The raised production forecasts come as global oil markets struggle with oversupply, resulting in producer group OPEC and other key exporters agreeing to cut their crude output from January.  U.S. production, however, is expected to rise to a record high of 10.9 million bpd in 2018 and 12.1 million bpd in 2019.  For Hess, production is expected to range between 270,000 and 280,000 boep\/d, excluding Libya, up from the 255,000 boep\/d it expects in 2018, while ConocoPhillips was aiming to produce 2.0-2.6 percent more oil and gas next year.  \u201cAs we focus spending on our high return investment opportunities, we will continue to reduce our unit costs to drive margin expansion and improve profitability,\u201d Hess Corp Chief Executive Officer John Hess said in a statement.

Bayu Undan has been the impoverished nation\u2019s main source of revenue for more than a decade, paying more than $20 billion into the Timor-Leste Petroleum Fund since 2004, ConocoPhillips said on its website.  The field is projected to run out of gas around 2022.  Previously, Bayu Undan fell within the Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA), a boxed-off zone between the two nations that allowed the development of resources while protracted negotiations over a permanent boundary continued.  The JPDA was governed by the 2003 Timor Sea Treaty, which allocated 90 percent of the taxes paid on business profits to East Timor and 10 percent to Australia.  The new permanent maritime boundary gives 100 percent of Bayu Undan tax revenue to East Timor, along with sole jurisdiction over, ownership and management of the field, ConocoPhillips said.  The new production sharing contracts, which took effect on Friday, give regulatory certainty on terms equivalent, leaving the operation of the field unchanged.  The Bayu Undan to Darwin pipeline, built in 2006 to feed the ConocoPhillips-operated Darwin LNG plant in Northern Australia, remains in Australia\u2019s jurisdiction.  The Darwin LNG plant produces 3.7 million tonnes each year, and needs to secure more feedstock once Bayu Undan runs dry.

It had previously forecast production of between 1.2 million boe\/d and 1.24 million boe\/d.  ConocoPhillips forecast capital spending of $6 billion this year, reflecting growing expenses from a higher U.S. oil price of $65 per barrel. It had initially budgeted $5.5 billion for 2018 capital expenditures and said the additional spending would be on well completions, work with production partners, and inflation.  \u201cWe\u2019re executing our operating plan and remain committed to our disciplined approach to the business,\u201d Chief Executive Ryan Lance said in a statement.

Jose Ignacio Hernandez, whom Guaido has tapped as a special prosecutor, told Reuters his team separately has challenged the amount of the ICSID award, claiming \u201cthe methodology to determine the compensation was errant.\u201d  Conoco would see no merit in a request for \u201cannulment or rectification\u201d and would \u201cstrongly defend\u201d against such requests, company spokesman Daren Beaudo said.  George Kahale, a U.S. attorney who represented the Venezuelan government before the World Bank tribunal, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Venezuela\u2019s information ministry also had no immediate response to a request for comment.  An annulment would be a boost to Guaido, who in January invoked a constitutional provision to assume an interim presidency. Backed by the United States and dozens of other countries, Guaido argues President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s 2018 re-election was illegitimate.  Hernandez has been assigned to protect Venezuela\u2019s assets abroad from possible seizure by creditors.  Cash-strapped Venezuela has balked at paying in other arbitration cases. Conoco has used legal seizures of Venezuelan oil assets to enforce earlier claims. Other creditors are attempting to seize shares in U.S. refiner Citgo Petroleum, Venezuela\u2019s prize overseas asset, to collect on debts.  It was unclear if Guaido\u2019s representatives have standing to challenge the award since the World Bank has not recognized Guaido. An ICSID spokesman said the body was not in a position to provide any further information on the case.  David Malpass, the newly named president of the World Bank, said last week that recognition would be up to its shareholders.

The arbitration decision, released by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), which has no means of enforcing its decisions, is considered by the U.S. company a first step in a series of legal actions to receive compensation for the expropriation of its assets in Venezuela.  PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment.  Venezuela\u2019s cash-constrained economy, almost completely dependent on oil exports, is in the grip of deep recession with hyperinflation and severe shortages of medicine and food. Its ability to pay has also been hurt by U.S. sanctions imposed on the country and PDVSA.  Conoco said it would pursue enforcement and seek financial recovery of its award but did not elaborate.

The border issue was settled earlier this year and East Timor wants to develop Greater Sunrise by piping gas to a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant on its south coast, while the project partners favour a plant in Darwin in north Australia.  \u201cAlthough we don\u2019t think a Timor Leste-based option is the most economic development, we respect their preference and their drivers for doing that and we\u2019ve agreed to make the sale,\u201d ConocoPhillips vice president Kayleen Ewin told Reuters.  \u201cWhat we really hope is that allows the Timor government to progress their vision for the development of Sunrise on their south coast.\u201d  The Greater Sunrise partners, led by Australia\u2019s Woodside Petroleum along with ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell and Japan\u2019s Osaka Gas, have long argued the Timor option would be unprofitable.  Under an agreement signed in March, East Timor will receive 70 percent of the royalty revenues from Sunrise if the gas is piped to its shores or 80 percent if piped to Australia.  An independent report to the United Nations said East Timor would have to invest $7.1 billion for an LNG project on its shores and found that with a tolling fee of $2 per million Btu, the Timor government and Timor LNG owner would reap a total of $15.2 billion.  In contrast, the country would reap $25 billion from the Darwin option, the report said.  Nevertheless the Timor government wants the gas to come to its shores as a way to diversify its economy, one of the world\u2019s poorest, using the gas to develop new industries and expertise.  The need is urgent as the government\u2019s main source of revenue, the Bayu Undan gas field run by ConocoPhillips, is set to run dry by 2022.  \u201cTimor-Leste looks forward to working with the other joint venture members to successfully develop the project,\u201d the country\u2019s former president Xanana Gusmao, who led the talks with ConocoPhillips, said in the statement released by the U.S. firm.  Analysts remain skeptical about prospects of the field being developed within the next 10 years, as the parties still need to negotiate fiscal terms and tolling agreements.  However Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic said if other parties get involved, such as the Chinese and Koreans, with further stake sales, it might go ahead.  \u201cWhile it remains an off-chance, Xanana Gusmao and the Timorese have a stubborn habit of fighting to make \u2018off-chances\u2019 become a reality,\u201d Kavonic said.  ConocoPhillips said its sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019, once funding is approved by East Timor\u2019s parliament and the partners decide whether to exercise their pre-emption rights.  Woodside and Shell had no immediate comment. Osaka Gas said it has no plans to buy an additional stake.  The Sunrise and Troubadour gas fields, together known as Greater Sunrise, hold around 5.1 trillion cubic feet of gas and about 226 million barrels of condensate.","33":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (In September 24 story, corrects projected U.S. shale output to likely struggling to achieve 7 million bpd by 2022 instead of likely falling by 4 million bpd in 2022, paragraph 4)  (Reuters) - U.S. oil producer ConocoPhillips COP.N sees global demand returning to 100 million barrels per day and growing from there, with oil an \"important part of the energy mix in any scenario\" going forward, a senior executive said on Thursday.  The view stands in contrast to that of rival BP Plc BP.L, which sees the coronavirus pandemic leaving a lasting effect on global energy demand, though ConocoPhillips still expects \"quite a bit of uncertainty next year,\" Senior Vice President Dominic Macklon said during a Q&A with Raymond James.  The company\u2019s capital spending in 2021 will be \u201csomewhat below\u201d its original planned 2020 level of $6.6 billion, Macklon said.  The hardest-hit area of the oil industry in 2020 has been U.S. shale, where producers cut production and sidelined equipment as oil prices crashed. While shale output was about 8.2 million bpd at the start of the year, at current prices the industry will likely struggle to produce 7 million bpd by 2022, Macklon said.  ConocoPhillips left seven drilling rigs at work in shale fields, but cut all fracking crews earlier this year as oil prices CLc1LCOc1 crashed. It is returning two fracking crews to work, Macklon said.  Some shale producers are stockpiling federal drilling permits ahead of the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election as a hedge against possible rule changes under a Democratic administration.. Just 20% of ConocoPhillips\u2019 Permian Basin acreage is on federal land in New Mexico, while the company expects to receive permits within a month for its Willow project along Alaska\u2019s North Slope, \u201cin which case we wouldn\u2019t be exposed\u201d to changes, Macklon said.  In July it agreed to buy land from Kelt Exploration Ltd in Canada\u2019s Montney shale oil play, in a $375 million deal. The 140,000 acres in British Columbia are adjacent to ConocoPhillips\u2019 own Montney lands.

The low-premium, all-stock deal comes as many U.S. shale companies have been mired in losses due to weak crude prices and, unlike in past downturns, have struggled to raise new capital to restructure heavy debts.  The deal swaps 1.46 shares of ConocoPhillips for each Concho share, an about 1.5% premium over its Friday price. Concho shares were up 1.4% at $49.30 in early trading on Monday. They sold for as much as $93 a share in January before the COVID-19 pandemic cut oil demand and prices.  The purchase would propel ConocoPhillips to the ranks of the top producers in the Permian Basin, the prime U.S. oilfield that stretches from West Texas to southeastern New Mexico. It also would make it the largest U.S. independent, pumping 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd).  The fifth-largest producer by volume in the Permian, Concho pumps about 319,000 bpd, from wells spread across more than half a million acres. Conoco is a major producer in two other U.S. shale fields, but pumps about 50,000 bpd in the Permian.  \u201cConcho has been on the short list of big Permian companies attracting interest due to its large production, vast acreage and relatively low debt,\u201d said Andrew Dittmar, M&A analyst at consultancy Enverus.  It has scant drilling acreage on federal lands, a plus given Democratic party presidential candidate Joe Biden\u2019s proposal to ban new fracking permits on government property, he said.  The sector has been consolidating after many shale producers borrowed in a bet on higher prices. Prices tanked instead, leaving shale investors with little to show for the rising output and companies struggling to pay down debts.  The deal valued Concho at about $51.89 per share based on Monday\u2019s price and continues a trend of all-stock, low-premium combinations, including the WPX Energy-Devon merger and Chevron Corp\u2019s purchase of Noble Energy.  ConocoPhillips said the premium was 15% based on Concho\u2019s price on Oct. 13, before news reports on the deal talks surfaced. Its shares traded up 0.6% at $33.97 after the open on Monday.  Concho had $3.9 billion in long-term debt at the end of June, and has not posted an annual profit since 2018. Its second quarter loss was $435 million, wider than a loss of $97 million a year earlier.  The combined company will hold about 23 billion barrels of oil equivalent resources with an average cost of supply of below $30 per barrel of U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude, Conoco said.  Concho shareholders will receive 1.46 shares of ConocoPhillips for each share held.  The deal is expected to provide $500 million in annual cost and capital savings by 2022.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - An appeals court has blocked construction of ConocoPhillips\u2019 $2 billion-plus Willow crude oil project in Alaska, putting on hold plans for one of the biggest oil projects in North Slope history.  The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in a weekend order sided with environmental and Native plaintiffs who challenged the Trump administration\u2019s go-ahead for ConocoPhillips\u2019 Willow project. Trump made oil-and-gas drilling a priority during his four-year term, but his successor, Joseph Biden, has taken several steps to restrict fossil fuel development.  The Trump administration approved the Willow development plan in October. Permits to mine for gravel and build roads were issued on the morning of Jan. 20, just before Biden was sworn in as the nation\u2019s 46th president.  The injunction issued Saturday night bars ConocoPhillips from conducting winter gravel mining and gravel road-building for the project while the lawsuit is ongoing.  Willow holds 590 million barrels of recoverable oil and could produce up to 160,000 barrels per day as soon as 2024, according to ConocoPhillips\u2019 previous estimates. Located on federal land in the National Petroleum Reserve of Alaska, Willow would be the North Slope\u2019s westernmost producing oil field.  The 9th Circuit Court order followed a Feb. 6 lower-court order that briefly paused construction. Both orders concluded that ConocoPhillips\u2019 gravel work would cause irreparable environmental harm.  Because most North Slope oilfield construction is limited to winter, the appeals court\u2019s injunction likely precludes construction until at least January, said Bridget Psarianos, an attorney with Trustees for Alaska, the environmental law firm representing the plaintiffs.  \u201cWe are grateful that the court has put a stop to destructive on-the-ground construction and blasting work while our lawsuit makes its way through court,\u201d Siqi\u00f1iq Maupin, executive director of Sovereign I\u00f1upiat for a Living Arctic, said in a statement released by Trustees for Alaska.

In December, President Fransisco Guterres vetoed the decree saying it could allow the petroleum funds to be misused, and called for the proposal to be revised.

FILE PHOTO: Logos of ConocoPhillips are seen in its booth at Gastech, the world's biggest expo for the gas industry, in Chiba, Japan, April 4, 2017. REUTERS\/Toru Hanai\/File Photo  The U.S. energy company has held discussions with investment banks about appointing advisers to the sale and could offer the shares to institutional investors as early as this month, said the people. They cautioned that the precise timing would depend on market conditions and could change.  If ConocoPhillips does not complete the sale in June or early July, it would then likely wait until September when institutional investors will have returned from their summer vacations, they added.  The ConocoPhillips stake in Cenovus is worth C$2.6 billion ($2 billion) based on its current share price but it would likely be sold at a small discount, the sources said. It would still be one of the biggest Canadian equity share sales this year.  ConocoPhillips has been actively selling assets and cutting costs in the past two years in order to cull debt and boost its dividend. It sold $17 billion in assets in 2017.  When Cenovus acquired oil sands and natural gas assets from ConocoPhillips for C$17 billion last year, it took 208 million shares of Cenovus, as well as C$14.1 billion of cash.  The deal made ConocoPhillips the biggest investor in the Calgary, Alberta-based company, although the U.S. oil giant has said it would not be a long-term holder of Cenovus equity.  ConocoPhillips and Cenovus declined to comment. The sources declined to be identified as the information is not public.  Shares of Cenovus extended their losses, to fall as much as 8.8 percent after the Reuters report. They closed down 5.7 percent at C$12.67 on Monday. The broader Canadian energy index was down 2.1 percent.  Cenovus shares have had a wild ride since the acquisition, declining as investors punished the stock over the deal, which was regarded as significantly stretching the Canadian company\u2019s finances.  While still down 27 percent since the deal was announced, they have been bouncing back of late on the back of an oil price CLc1 rebound. The stock is up 24 percent in the last three months.  The move follows a similar overnight stock sale by Royal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.L, which last month sold its entire stake in Canadian Natural Resources Ltd CNQ.TO for $3.3 billion.  At the time of the 2017 deal, ConocoPhillips valued its Cenovus stake at $9.41 per share based on Cenovus\u2019 New York-listed stock. Since the May 17, 2017, transaction close, the share price has see-sawed above and below that value, although it has consistently traded higher since April 25.  While overnight trades tend to be discounted from current share price levels, in order to incentivize investors, Conoco would need Cenovus\u2019 value to be at a point where it is making money even after the discount to make the sale worthwhile. If the same 2.9 percent reduction was applied from Shell\u2019s overnight sale of Canadian Natural Resources shares, the Cenovus stock would need to be above $9.68 to generate a profit.  Conoco has also moved aggressively to get cash in other areas, including by seizing international assets controlled by Venezuelan state-controlled oil producer PDVSA.  Much of the fresh cash the company has raked in has gone back to shareholders, with the company\u2019s dividend up about 8 percent in the first quarter to 28 cents and a plan to buy back $2 billion in shares this year.","80":"(Reuters) - Oil producer ConocoPhillips, which is buying Concho Resources Inc for $8.3 billion, posted a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss on Thursday as it benefited from a recovery in crude oil prices from pandemic-driven lows.

It narrowly beat analyst expectations with an adjusted loss of 31 cents per share, 1 cent narrower than analysts\u2019 average forecast, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Third-quarter production was 1.1 million barrels of oil and gas per day, compared with about 1.3 million barrels in the same period last year. The company expects to end the year making around 1.1 million barrels daily and plans to hold production flat next year, Chief Executive Ryan Lance told analysts on Thursday.  \u201cWe remain cautious on the pace and timing of recovery,\u201d Lance said.  As oil prices collapsed in the spring during global coronavirus lockdowns, ConocoPhillips said it would curtail more output than any North American producer, reducing its output by 460,000 barrels per day by June.  But the company reversed curtailments during the third quarter and Lance said it was now \u201cback to more normal business\u201d and would focus on the Concho acquisition.

The company in November had set a target to raise oil production by 3% this year on a budget of nearly $7 billion.  Producers have been slashing spending and trimming output as a global oil surplus has been building. Demand has been falling as employees stay home, stores remain closed and governments limit travel to fight coronavirus.  U.S. crude futures were trading down at $23.96 a barrel on Wednesday, declining by more than half from December as OPEC and Russia threw off output curbs and launched a price war that has added to the price drop.  Conoco originally set its 2020 budget and production targets assuming oil at $50 a barrel.  The company\u2019s shares were down 6.3% to $24.60 amid a broader drop in oil stocks and U.S. stocks, and opened at their lowest level in 16 years.  \u201cOur industry is clearly experiencing an unprecedented event brought about by simultaneous supply and demand shocks,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Ryan Lance said.  Conoco said it would slow development activity in the United States, lower it in 48 states and defer drilling in Alaska.  The company\u2019s cuts will add to Alaska\u2019s pain. The state faces a $1.5 billion budget deficit and froze hiring this month as revenue from oil and gas continues to fall.  Conoco had forecast spending about $3.4 billion in the state this year, more than half the industry\u2019s total capital and operating expenditure in the state. It is developing new fields in the northern-most U.S. state and has said it would spend about $25 billion there to maintain and increase production through 2045.  The company also halved its $3 billion a year share buyback program, and said it would reduce its share repurchase to a quarterly run rate of $250 million beginning in the second quarter, from the previous run rate of $750 million.  Conoco has turned to distributing returns to shareholders primarily through stock buybacks after slashing its dividend during the last oil bust in 2016.  Other shale firms and oil majors have also sought to cut production and spending. Saudi Aramco last week outlined plans to cut its spending by $2.8 billion to $7.8 billion while Exxon Mobil, BP and Chevron also promised unspecified cuts.","85":"FILE PHOTO: The logo for ConocoPhillips is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., January 13, 2020.

U.S. shale drillers had to cut supply by roughly 2 million barrels per day to counter a historic crude price crash stemming from low demand caused by coronavirus-induced lockdowns and a price war between top producers.  However, nearly a quarter of the shut-in production is expected to have been brought back in June, as a recovery in benchmark oil prices to around $40 a barrel makes some shale output profitable again.  ConocoPhillips said it would revive production in the Lower 48 region during July, while in Surmont it would increase output from curtailed levels in the third quarter.

Taking a stake would help East Timor position itself to push for the development of Greater Sunrise, discovered in 1974 but long delayed as it straddles the maritime border between Australia and East Timor, which was only agreed earlier this year following a protracted dispute between the two countries.  \u201cAlthough we differ with the government on its proposed development plan for Sunrise, we recognize the importance of the field to the nation of Timor-Leste,\u201d ConocoPhillips said.

The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019, once certain conditions are met, Conoco said.  The border agreement outlined two options for developing Greater Sunrise - piping the gas to East Timor, which the tiny Southeast Asian nation has long wanted, or piping it to Australia for processing.  East Timor wants the gas to come to its shores as it is eager to develop oil and gas-based industries, such as petrochemicals manufacturing, to diversify its economy, one of the world\u2019s poorest.  The need is urgent as the government\u2019s main source of revenue, the Bayu Undan gas field run by ConocoPhillips, is set to run dry by 2022.

Australia\u2019s Woodside Petroleum, operator and 33 percent stakeholder in Greater Sunrise, could not be reached for comment outside of business hours.

The border issue was settled earlier this year and East Timor wants to develop Greater Sunrise by piping gas to a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant on its south coast, while the project partners favor a plant in Darwin in north Australia.  \u201cAlthough we don\u2019t think a Timor Leste-based option is the most economic development, we respect their preference and their drivers for doing that and we\u2019ve agreed to make the sale,\u201d ConocoPhillips vice president Kayleen Ewin told Reuters.  \u201cWhat we really hope is that allows the Timor government to progress their vision for the development of Sunrise on their south coast.\u201d  The Greater Sunrise partners, led by Australia's Woodside Petroleum WPL.AX along with ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.AS and Japan's Osaka Gas 9532.T, have long argued the Timor option would be unprofitable.  Under an agreement signed in March, East Timor will receive 70 percent of the royalty revenues from Sunrise if the gas is piped to its shores or 80 percent if piped to Australia.  An independent report to the United Nations said East Timor would have to invest $7.1 billion for an LNG project on its shores and found that with a tolling fee of $2 per million Btu, the Timor government and Timor LNG owner would reap a total of $15.2 billion.  In contrast, the country would reap $25 billion from the Darwin option, the report said.  Nevertheless the Timor government wants the gas to come to its shores as a way to diversify its economy, one of the world\u2019s poorest, using the gas to develop new industries and expertise.  The need is urgent as the government\u2019s main source of revenue, the Bayu Undan gas field run by ConocoPhillips, is set to run dry by 2022.  \u201cTimor-Leste looks forward to working with the other joint venture members to successfully develop the project,\u201d the country\u2019s former president Xanana Gusmao, who led the talks with ConocoPhillips, said in the statement released by the U.S. firm.  Analysts remain skeptical about prospects of the field being developed within the next 10 years, as the parties still need to negotiate fiscal terms and tolling agreements.  However Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic said if other parties get involved, such as the Chinese and Koreans, with further stake sales, it might go ahead.  \u201cWhile it remains an off-chance, Xanana Gusmao and the Timorese have a stubborn habit of fighting to make \u2018off-chances\u2019 become a reality,\u201d Kavonic said.  ConocoPhillips said its sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019, once funding is approved by East Timor\u2019s parliament and the partners decide whether to exercise their pre-emption rights.  Woodside, Shell and Osaka Gas said they would work with East Timor to progress the project, including production sharing contracts and fiscal terms, but made no comment on their preferred development option.  Osaka Gas said it has no plans to buy an additional stake, but Woodside and Shell made no comment on their pre-emption rights.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The low-premium, all-stock deal comes as many U.S. shale companies have been mired in losses due to weak crude prices and, unlike in past downturns, have struggled to raise new capital to restructure heavy debts.  The deal swaps 1.46 shares of ConocoPhillips for each Concho share, at a premium of about 1.5% over its Friday price. Shares in Concho and ConocoPhillips on Monday fell amid a market selloff, with Concho off 2.8% at $47.26 and ConocoPhillips down 3.2% to $32.70. Concho had sold for as much as $93 a share in January before the COVID-19 pandemic cut oil demand and prices.  \u201cSize, scope and scale has become more important,\u201d said Concho Chief Executive Timothy Leach, who will run the combined company\u2019s U.S. production excluding Alaska. \u201cThis combination with ConocoPhillips was the best thing for our shareholders.\u201d  The purchase propels ConocoPhillips to the ranks of the top producers in the Permian Basin, the prime U.S. oilfield, and makes it the largest U.S. independent oil and gas producer, pumping 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd).  The fifth-largest producer by volume in the Permian, Concho pumps about 319,000 bpd, from wells spread across more than half a million acres. ConocoPhillips is a major producer in two other U.S. shale fields but pumps about 50,000 bpd in the Permian.  \u201cConcho has been on the short list of big Permian companies attracting interest due to its large production, vast acreage and relatively low debt,\u201d said Andrew Dittmar, M&A analyst at consultancy Enverus.  It has scant drilling acreage on federal lands, a plus given Democratic party presidential candidate Joe Biden\u2019s proposal to ban new fracking permits on government property, he said.  ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance said the two executives have a shared vision for building a business that can endure volatile markets. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on low-cost supply,\u201d he said, adding Concho has \u201ca low-cost supply that fits.\u201d  The sector has been consolidating after many shale producers borrowed in a bet on higher prices. Prices tanked instead, leaving shale investors with little to show for the rising output and companies struggling to pay down debts.  The deal continues a trend of all-stock, low-premium combinations, including the WPX Energy-Devon merger and Chevron Corp CVX.N's purchase of Noble Energy.  ConocoPhillips said the premium was 15% based on Concho\u2019s price on Oct. 13, before news reports on the deal talks surfaced.  Concho had $3.9 billion in long-term debt at the end of June and has not posted an annual profit since 2018. Its second quarter loss was $435 million, wider than a loss of $97 million a year earlier.  The combined company will hold about 23 billion barrels of oil and gas with an average cost of supply of below $30 per barrel of U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude, ConocoPhillips said.

The proceeds were part of a first installment under a deal to satisfy a $2 billion arbitration award Conoco won earlier this year over broken oil contracts in the South American country.  The payment, disclosed with the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings, came months after Conoco went to local courts and obtained the right to seize most of Petroleos de Venezuela\u2019s Caribbean inventories, logistics and storage assets to enforce an April arbitration award.  PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment.  The state oil company is facing payments in coming days on bonds maturing in 2020. PDVSA used Citgo Petroleum, its U.S. refining unit, as 51 percent collateral on the 2020 bond.  Conoco in August suspended its legal seizures of PDVSA assets on the islands of Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao, and St Eustatius after PDVSA agreed to make an initial, $500 million payment within 90 days.  The court-ordered seizures aggravated Venezuela\u2019s oil-export declines caused by falling oil production due to lack of investment and an exodus of skilled workers. Oil is the financial backbone of the country\u2019s economy, which is suffering from hyperinflation and financial sanctions by the U.S. government.  The U.S. oil producer said on Thursday it expects to receive the remaining $155 million of PDVSA\u2019s first payment this quarter. A Conoco spokesman was unable to detail how much of the initial payment was cash and whether the commodities received included crude or refined products in storage at PDVSA Caribbean terminals.  Conoco scheduled a conference call later on Thursday to discuss details of its third quarter results.  The agreement with PDVSA provided for the remaining $1.5 billion of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) award to be paid quarterly to Conoco over a 4-1\/2 year period. Conoco had sought $22 billion from PDVSA through the ICC for broken contracts and loss of future profits from two oil production projects in the country.  The settlement is not the end of legal maneuvers stemming from Conoco\u2019s 2007 exit from Venezuela during the country\u2019s nationalization drive. Conoco has an arbitration case before the World Bank\u2019s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes that is expected to be concluded this year.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The world\u2019s largest independent oil and gas producer plans to accelerate output cuts by 40,000 barrels per day (bpd) in May and bring its reduction in North America by June to 460,000 bpd, the largest cut by any producer.  \u201cWe\u2019d be curtailing as much as we could right now,\u201d Chief Executive Ryan Lance said on a call with analysts, noting decades-low prices. Industry production cuts are \u201cgoing to drive supply down to match inventory levels and what the refineries can take,\u201d he said.  The June figure includes a 100,000 bpd reduction in the company\u2019s Alaska oil and gas production. ConocoPhillips is one of the state\u2019s largest oil producers, with 2019 output of 217,000 bpd.  Crude prices have crashed in the past six weeks as the coronavirus outbreak hit demand during a Russia-Saudi price war, leading to a global oil glut and prompting higher cost U.S. producers to sharply curb output.  Houston-based ConocoPhillips reported a first-quarter loss on Thursday as it took big hits from impairments and the falling value of its stake in Canadian producer Cenovus Energy Inc.  ConocoPhillips is the biggest shareholder of Cenovus, with a 17% stake, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, and its unrealized loss on the stake was $1.69 billion during the quarter.  Total realized price per barrel was $38.81 in the quarter compared with $50.59 a year earlier, ConocoPhillips said.  The company posted a net loss of $1.74 billion, or $1.60 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a profit of $1.83 billion, or $1.60 per share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, ConocoPhillips earned 45 cents per share, while analysts had expected a profit of 23 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  ConocoPhillips shares edged lower to $42.10 and are off 36% year to date.  The company\u2019s production, excluding Libya, in the latest quarter was 1.28 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day, a drop of 40,000 BOE per day from the same period a year ago.","102":"April 30 (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas company ConocoPhillips reported a 58% plunge in adjusted quarterly profit on Thursday, weighed down by lower output and an unprecedented plunge in crude prices.

Logos of ConocoPhillips are seen in its booth at Gastech, the world's biggest expo for the gas industry, in Chiba, Japan, April 4, 2017. REUTERS\/Toru Hanai  The company may have to fight to collect. Venezuela has balked at paying in other arbitration cases and may challenge the World Bank tribunal\u2019s decision. Conoco previously has used legal seizures of Venezuelan oil assets to enforce its claims.  The oil company had sought up to $30 billion for the takeover of three oil projects more than 10 years ago, according to a World Bank report. The tribunal, known as ICSID, found the takeover unlawful in 2013 and two years ago rejected the OPEC-member country\u2019s request for reconsideration.  The tribunal said Conoco could not seek double recovery. It was not immediately clear how that finding would affect Friday\u2019s total $8.7 billion award. The past award covered two of the company\u2019s three oil projects in Venezuela.  Venezuela\u2019s oil production has fallen to an almost seven-decade low due to mismanagement, a lack of investment and financial sanctions imposed by the U.S. government. Its declining oil exports have led the nation into a severe economic crisis and fueled an exodus of about 3 million residents.  Venezuela\u2019s main foreign asset is U.S.-based Citgo Petroleum, an oil refiner that recently appointed with Washington\u2019s support a board of directors independent of Venezuela\u2019s socialist government.  \u201cFor Venezuela, it is possible to pay Conoco with Citgo\u2019s assets, so this award makes it politically complex for the U.S. government to protect Citgo against creditors if one of the claimants is a U.S.-based company,\u201d said Francisco Monaldi, an expert in Latin American energy at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute.  Venezuela\u2019s communications ministry was unavailable for immediate comment, and state-owned oil company PDVSA said it would not comment immediately.  The government of opposition leader Juan Guaido is \u201canalyzing its options to defend the Republic,\u201d Miguel Angel Santos, an adviser to the government\u2019s representative to the Inter-American Development Bank, said in a tweet on Friday.  The South American country six times sought and failed to disqualify one of the panel\u2019s three arbitrators. The rejection could provide Venezuela an avenue to challenge the award, said an attorney familiar with the country\u2019s arbitration cases who declined to be identified.  Law firm Curtis Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle, which represented Venezuela before the tribunal, had no comment.  \u201cHaving willfully breached its international obligations, Venezuela cannot claim the benefit of any restriction of its liability under international law,\u201d the tribunal wrote. As a result, Conoco is \u201centitled to full reparation for the takings in accordance with international law.\u201d  The decision \u201cupholds the principle that governments cannot unlawfully expropriate private investments without paying compensation,\u201d Conoco General Counsel Kelly B. Rose said.  While Conoco prevailed in its main claim of damages arising from the expropriation of its assets, the award represents about 40 percent of its claim. ICSID ruled against the company\u2019s request for the loss of future tax credits, which was valued at some $10 billion, the ICSID said.  The tribunal\u2019s decision brings Conoco\u2019s total awards under two different Venezuela arbitration cases to $10.7 billion. Under World Bank rules either party to a decision can request to annul the award, which would trigger a stay of any enforcement.  Last year, Conoco received a $2.04 billion award from the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) involving broken contracts on some of the same assets. PDVSA agreed to pay the award and delivered $400 million after Conoco began to attach assets in the Caribbean to enforce the ruling.  Canadian mining firms Rusoro Mining Ltd and Crystallex International Corp last fall each settled an arbitration claim with Venezuela for more than $1 billion.  Exxon Mobil Corp\u2019s $1.6-billion award against Venezuela over its 2007 oil project expropriation was annulled by the ICSID in 2015. Exxon last year filed a new claim seeking to restore the original decision.  Venezuela\u2019s nationalization wave, led by Chavez as part of his Socialist project, led to more than 20 international arbitration claims, which remain mostly unpaid.  Conoco shares closed down 3.7 percent at $65.43.","104":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips COP.N, the world's largest independent oil and gas exploration and production company, posted a bigger-than-expected first-quarter profit on Thursday, helped by rising crude prices CLc1 and cost cuts.

Conoco\u2019s stock has risen as the company has prioritized cost cuts and asset sales over production increases. The Houston-based company generated more cash in the first quarter than its capital budget and shareholder payouts, an accomplishment feted by analysts.  Shares are up about 21 percent so far this year, outpacing the S&P 500 Energy Index .SPNY, which has gained about 3 percent since January. The stock's biggest increase came after the company boosted its share buyback and dividend in February.  Conoco\u2019s stock closed 2.9 percent higher at $66.97.  \u201cWe\u2019re maintaining our discipline and following our game plan,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Don Wallette told investors on a conference call.

Excluding one-time items, the company earned 96 cents per share, exceeding the 73 cents expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Doug Terreson, an oil industry analyst with Evercore ISI, said the results reflected a \u201cpositive surprise\u201d and were an indication that energy companies can generate healthy profits even when prioritizing shareholder returns.  Production fell 23 percent to 1.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe\/d) as a result of recent asset sales.  Conoco's U.S. shale operations, which made money after losing cash for more than a year, are now profitable at oil prices CLc1 under $45 per barrel, more than $20 below current levels.  \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the earnings power of our unconventional operations driving our overall portfolio,\u201d Wallette said.

Conoco said on Wednesday an international arbitration court ordered Venezuela\u2019s state-run oil company, PDVSA [PDVSA.UL], to pay it $2.04 billion for early dissolution of two joint ventures.  \u201cWe intend to be aggressive and persistent\u201d in recovering the award, Wallette said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s going to take time to recover, the value that we lost.\u201d  Rivals Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N and Chevron Corp CVX.N report results on Friday.","105":"(Reuters) - Courts in Curacao and Bonaire have partially lifted attachments introduced by ConocoPhillips aiming to seize Venezuelan PDVSA\u2019s [PDVSA.UL] assets to satisfy a $2 billion arbitration ruling, according to a copy of the documents seen by Reuters.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Conoco has aggressively moved to take over state-run oil firm PDVSA\u2019s inventories, cargoes and facilities following an award by the International Chamber of Commerce last month.  The dispute has particularly affected the Caribbean, where PDVSA owns and operates refineries and terminals that supply several islands.  \u201cBoth the court in Curacao and those in Bonaire have decided that the attachments must be lifted to the extent that this is necessary for the fuel and\/or electricity supply on both islands,\u201d the Common Court of Justice said in a release.  The proceeds from the fuel sales to local distributor Curoil must be transferred to a specially designated account, where the money will remain until it is established who will be entitled to it, the court added.  \u201cWe are pleased with the result, as this is consistent with the proposal made by ConocoPhillips to both (islands\u2019) local authorities, Curoil and the local courts,\u201d Conoco said in a statement.  PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment. Conoco\u2019s seizure requests froze PDVSA\u2019s oil inventories in Aruba, Curacao, Bonaire and St. Eustatius, as well as two oil cargoes off Aruba. Curacao\u2019s 335,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) Isla refinery is currently operating, but PDVSA has not sent crude to that facility since last week, so it is expected to halt operations in the near future, according to PDVSA sources.  The Bonaire and Curacao judges also ruled that PDVSA must resume fuel deliveries to Curoil, but it is unclear how Isla would continue producing. PDVSA will be fined $1 million for each day it does not comply with the ruling, with a maximum fine of $100 million, the Curacao judge said in a statement.  Conoco\u2019s legal actions have created worry across the Caribbean and Central America as 47,000 bpd of fuel were expected to be shipped by PDVSA from Curacao in May mainly to Cuba, Belize, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Haiti, according to PDVSA\u2019s internal trade reports.  Curacao Prime Minister Eugene Rhuggenaath last week said the dispute is posing a \u201cpotential crisis\u201d for the island. Aruba is preparing a contingency plan to avoid a situation similar to Curacao and Bonaire, where inventories were blocked, according to Aruba\u2019s prime minister, Evelyn Wever-Croes.  The U.S. State Department earlier this week said there is enough oil in the global market to make up for potential fuel disruptions due to Conoco\u2019s actions. \u201cThe U.S. Department of State remains in contact with our partners in the Caribbean to reduce the risk of supply disruptions,\u201d said Vincent Campos, spokesman for the Bureau of Energy Resources.","106":"March 28 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips:  * CONOCOPHILLIPS ANNOUNCES PRICING OF CASH TENDER OFFER  * CONOCOPHILLIPS ANNOUNCES PURCHASE UP TO $400 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF OUTSTANDING DEBT SECURITIES Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","107":"HOUSTON\/BANGALORE (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips COP.N said on Thursday it would slash spending and cut U.S. oil output by about 30% of this year's target, the largest cut so far by a major shale producer to deal with an unprecedented drop in oil demand.

Overall, U.S. and Canadian producers have chopped 729,000 bpd from their goals, according to a Reuters tally of announced cuts.  The cuts are quickly outpacing even the most recent U.S. government forecasts. By December, the reductions could lop off 2.15 million bpd from pre-coronavirus targets, consultancy Rystad Energy said on Wednesday. That would put the United States slightly above the curbs sought by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries this month.  \u201cWe are just not going to sell our crude for these kinds of prices,\u201d ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Ryan Lance said on a call with analysts. \u201cI would expect you\u2019re going to see a lot more of this.\u201d  OPEC and its allies, including Russia, this month pledged to cut their May production by roughly 9.7 million bpd to halt an oil glut. They have called on the United States, Norway, Brazil and others to take steps to curb production to support their own energy industries.  The U.S. government cannot mandate cuts by private firms, but producers have shut in wells as they face rapidly filling U.S. pipelines and storage tanks, and falling demand for oil by refiners.  Some U.S. producers including Chevron Corp CVX.N, Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY.N, and Diamondback Energy Inc FANG.O have whacked spending. The top U.S. oil company, Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N, this month slashed spending by 30%. Overall, oil companies have pulled back 2020 spending plans by an average of 22%.  ConocoPhillips said in addition to cutting 125,000 bpd from its mainland U.S. operations, it will reduce production in Canada by about 100,000 bpd due to low prices.  The company last month halved its $3 billion-a-year share buyback program and on Wednesday suspended purchases altogether. It has emphasized buybacks as its primary means of rewarding shareholders, but will continue to pay a cash dividend.  ConocoPhillips is reducing its 2020 spending budget by 35% from its original $6.6 billion target. The new budget is $4.3 billion, it said.  Executive and employee pay increases granted earlier in 2020 will be canceled and everyone will be paid at 2019 levels, the company said.  U.S. and Canadian producers, generally burdened with higher costs than some of their global competitors, have slashed spending overall by more than $37 billion, or around 30%.  ConocoPhillips said it will not cut production in Alaska, but will focus cuts on other North American fields.  It does not plan to complete any more wells in its Texas and North Dakota this year and is halting all hydraulic fracturing, said Matt Fox, chief operating officer, the final step to completing new wells.

REUTERS\/Toru Hanai\/File Photo  Reuters had reported on Wednesday that Chrysaor and Conoco were close to sealing the deal, citing sources close to the process who put the value of the assets at up to $2.8 billion.  The North Sea has undergone a major transformation in recent years, as long-standing producers have sold assets to smaller players such as Chrysaor who say they can squeeze more money out of fields due to their nimbler operations.  For Conoco the disposal is part of a continuing refocus on its U.S. operations. \u201cThis disposition is part of our ongoing effort to hone our portfolio and focus our investments across future low cost-of-supply opportunities,\u201d said Chief Executive Ryan Lance.  The Conoco assets produced 72,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) last year, the U.S. company said.  Chrysaor said the deal, which will be backdated to start in January last year and which is subject to regulatory approval, would bring it up to 177,000 boed pro forma in 2018 and 185,000 boed in 2019.  On its website, Chrysaor said it expected production in 2018-2020 to average between 120,000 and 130,000 boed, but a spokesman said last year\u2019s production was down due to a pipeline blockage.  Chrysaor, backed by private equity firm EIG Global Partners, is already one of the biggest North Sea player after acquiring assets from Royal Dutch Shell for $3.8 billion in 2017.  Thursday\u2019s sale is expected to close in the second half of the year and Chrysaor will pay unspecified interest in the deal which is not included in the $2.68 billion, Conoco said.

Energy and chemicals firm Ineos, owned by British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, had previously abandoned exclusive talks with Conoco over the fields, including a 7.5 percent stake in the Clair project west of the Shetland Islands, whose other owners are BP, Shell and Chevron.  Another bidder was energy-focused private equity group HitecVision.  In the British North Sea, BP targets around 200,000 boed by 2020, Shell has said it produced 140,000 bpd last year, Total around 180,000 boed and smaller companies such as Premier and EnQuest produce less than 100,000 boed, according to company and Stifel research data.","123":"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela on Thursday scorned a $2.04 billion award to ConocoPhillips COP.N over a decade-old nationalization as the U.S. oil producer filed suit in a federal court to enforce the decision.

Conoco filed suit on Thursday in the U.S. District court in Manhattan seeking to enforce the award, saying the court had jurisdiction because the ICC arbitration was held in New York and PDVSA had not responded to a demand for payment.  Conoco\u2019s assets in Venezuela were expropriated in 2007 following nationalization of the country\u2019s oil industry led by then-President Hugo Chavez.

Taking a stake would help East Timor position itself to push for the development of Greater Sunrise, discovered in 1974 but long delayed as it straddles the maritime border between Australia and East Timor, which was only agreed earlier this year following a protracted dispute between the two countries.  The border agreement outlined two options for developing Greater Sunrise -- piping the gas to East Timor, which the tiny Southeast Asian nation has long wanted, or piping it to Australia for processing.  East Timor wants the gas to come to its shores as it is eager to develop oil and gas-based industries, such as petrochemicals manufacturing, to diversify its economy, one of the world\u2019s poorest.  The need is urgent as the government\u2019s main source of revenue, the Bayu Undan gas field run by ConocoPhillips, is set to run dry by 2022.  The Sunrise and Troubadour gas fields, together known as Greater Sunrise, were discovered in 1974 and hold around 5.1 trillion cubic feet of gas, according to the project\u2019s operator, Australia\u2019s Woodside Petroleum.  The fields also hold about 226 million barrels of condensate, an ultra-light form of crude oil that would help make the development more profitable.  The other owners are Royal Dutch Shell and Japan\u2019s Osaka Gas.  State-owned company Timor Gap is looking to build a liquefied natural gas plant on the country\u2019s south coast, the Australian Financial Review said.  Timor Gap was not immediately available for comment. Pires did not respond to an email.

Investors have been urging U.S. oil companies to increase returns on tight spending at a time when they are also looking beyond the Permian Basin, which is getting crowded and costly.  Hess said the lion\u2019s share of its 2019 capital expenditure will go towards exploration in Guyana and Bakken. Conoco will spend most of its capex in Alaska and Canada, it said.  The 2019 production views come as global oil markets struggle with oversupply, resulting in producer group OPEC and other key exporters agreeing to cut their crude output from January.  Production in the United States, however, is expected to rise to a record high 10.9 million bpd in 2018 and 12.1 million bpd in 2019.  For Hess, production is expected to range between 270,000 and 280,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boep\/d) excluding Libya, up from the 255,000 boep\/d it expects in 2018, while ConocoPhillips was aiming to produce 2.0-2.6 percent more oil and gas next year.

Flaring, the practice of deliberately burning unwanted gas, has become a concern for environmentalists and investors on fears that it exacerbates climate change by releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.  After a surge in the controversial practice, shale companies have come under pressure to curb it and to check greenhouse gas emissions, while Texas is considering tightening some rules around it.  ConocoPhillips continues to take steps to reduce flaring in Permian Basin\u2019s Goldsmith area by improving operational procedures, including shut-ins, John Roper, director of the company\u2019s media relations and crisis communications, told Reuters.  \u201cThese efforts have reduced the need for flaring events and eliminated the need to pursue the RRC (Railroad Commission of Texas) applications,\u201d added Roper.  The RRC confirmed that ConocoPhillips had withdrawn its request in a letter dated Sept. 2.  In October, the company had applied for a two-year permit to cover unplanned flaring in its Goldsmith facilities.  A report by the Environmental Integrity Project, a non-profit organization, citing state records, said the 41 Conoco sites burned 1.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas in 2018-2019, releasing more than 1,262 tons of sulfur dioxide.  Although companies have to apply for permits to burn unwanted gas, Texas currently allows producers to do so for six months and routinely issues waivers after the six months expires.  The head of the RRC said in June that Texas as early as this fall could tighten some flaring rules.  Recommendations from an industry panel included reducing to 90 from 180 the number of days producers can routinely burn unwanted gas without going to the RRC for a hearing.

ConocoPhillips set a $5.5 billion spending budget for 2021, much of which will be used to maintain current production. The higher spending reflects its purchase of shale oil rival Concho, a $13.3 billion shale acquisition that was struck as lower fuel prices and demand spurred consolidation.

Conoco disclosed in October that it had received a total of $754 million from PDVSA through the third quarter under the $2 billion settlement agreement.  \u201cWe are working closely with the U.S. government to determine the best course of action and will comply with all applicable U.S. orders, laws and regulations\u201d governing transactions with PDVSA, Beaudo added.","138":"(Reuters) - ConocoPhillips COP.N beat analysts' estimates for profit in the third quarter, as the world's largest independent oil and gas producer benefited from higher oil prices and a program of asset sales and technology-driven cost cuts.

REUTERS\/Toru Hanai  With oil prices rising steadily through the quarter, the company sold each barrel of oil equivalents at a 46 percent higher rate, helping it raise its projected capital spending in 2018 for the second time this year.  Conoco also cut jobs, reduced operating costs in several projects and raised its dividend by 7 percent, with Chief Executive Ryan Lance promising to improve cash flow and shareholder returns.  \u201cThis is what the market can expect from us again in 2019,\u201d Lance said.  Shares of Conoco rose 3.3 percent at $67.84 in morning trade.  In the United States, the company has been focusing on production from the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford and Bakken shale areas - what the company calls its \u201cLower 48 Big 3.\u201d  Production from these basins rose 48 percent in the quarter and is set to rise more than 35 percent for the full year.  The Houston-based company also has projects in Europe, Asia Pacific and the Middle East, which has helped the company benefit from a 30 percent rise in Brent prices from a year earlier.  A high exposure to Brent has given Conoco an edge over its U.S. rivals, who have been hit by transport bottlenecks that has lowered prices of Texas local crude.  \u201c(Conoco) has access to where pricing is highest and that\u2019s kind of how they have structured the company and certainly has worked to their benefit,\u201d said RBC Capital Markets analyst Scott Hanold.  The company said it now expects to spend $100 million more from its July forecast of $6 billion, with production in the quarter rising nearly 2 percent. Conoco said the budget raise reflected higher spending on third-party operators.  Net income rose to $1.9 billion, or $1.59 per share, in the third-quarter ended Sept. 30, which included a $345 million payment related to a settlement agreement with Venezuela\u2019s PDVSA.  Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.36 per share, beating analysts\u2019 estimate of $1.18 per share, according to Refinitiv data.  Conoco is set to host a conference call later in the day to discuss details of results.","139":"BEIJING, May 22 (Reuters) -  * CNOOC Ltd, a listed branch of China National Offshore Oil Corp, has launched its combined Penglai 19-3 Oilfield Area 4 adjustment and Penglai 19-9 oilfield Phase II project  * The offshore development is in China\u2019s Bohai Bay and is expected to reach peak production of 15,681 barrels of crude oil per day in 2022  * CNOOC Ltd holds a 51% interest in the project and is the operator; ConocoPhillips China, a subsidiary of U.S. oil giant ConocoPhillips, holds a 49% interest (Reporting by Muyu Xu and Tom Daly; Editing by Tom Hogue)","140":"LONDON (Reuters) - Private-equity backed Chrysaor is near a deal to buy U.S. group ConocoPhillips\u2019 British North Sea oilfields, two sources close to the process said, a deal that would make it the basin\u2019s biggest producer.  Britain\u2019s aging North Sea has undergone a major transformation in recent years as long-standing producers have sold assets to smaller players such as Chrysaor that say they can squeeze more money out of fields due to nimbler operations.  Chrysaor and Conoco have agreed on the main terms of the acquisition in recent weeks but the deal, expected to be signed in the coming days, could still fall through, the sources said.  Conoco, having entered the British North Sea over 50 years ago, produced around 77,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) there in 2018, according to its website.  With Chrysaor aiming to produce up to 130,000 boed by next year, the acquisition would catapult it to becoming the British North Sea\u2019s largest producer ahead of BP, which is aiming to grow its British North Sea output to 200,000 boed by 2020.  BMO Capital Markets and Jefferies are acting for Chrysaor in relation to the Conoco assets, the sources said.  The value of the deal and how much cash would actually change hands was still unclear.  Parties involved in the bidding process estimated the assets could be worth up to $2.8 billion, depending on which date the sides agree as the start of the deal, which could go back to as early as January 2018.  Chrysaor, backed by private equity firm EIG Global Partners, became one of the biggest North Sea player after acquiring assets from Royal Dutch Shell for $3.8 billion in 2017.  Energy and chemicals firm Ineos, privately owned by British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, had previously abandoned exclusive talks with the U.S. company over the fields, including a 7.5 percent stake in the Clair project West of the Shetland Islands, whose other owners are BP, Shell and Chevron.  Another bidder was energy-focussed private equity group HitecVision, which has been expanding aggressively in the Norwegian North Sea, partially in partnership with Eni.  Shell has said it produced 140,000 bpd last year, Total around 180,000 boed and smaller companies such as Premier and EnQuest produce less than 100,000 boed in the British North Sea, according to company and Stifel research data.  Chevron, which is estimated to produce around 75,000 bpd in the region, is also in process of selling its British North Sea assets. Israel\u2019s Delek via its North Sea unit Ithaca Energy is front-runner for the portfolio, industry sources say.  Chrysaor, Jefferies and BMO declined to comment. A ConocoPhillips spokesman said the group was marketing its British North Sea assets excluding London and Teesside but would not comment further.

As part of Norway\u2019s efforts to shift its $1 trillion \u201crainy day\u201d fund away from oil, the country\u2019s parliament on Wednesday adopted a plan to drop all dedicated oil and gas explorers and producers, as defined by stock market indices provider FTSE Russell, from the fund\u2019s benchmark index.  ConocoPhillips and Hess were both added to the list of those classified as \u201cexploration and production\u201d this month, FTSE Russell said, with the change coming into effect on June 24.  Norway\u2019s wealth fund data shows it held a stake in ConocoPhillips of 1%, worth $714 million, at end-2018, as well as $64 million worth of corporate bonds issued by the oil major, which was not immediately available for comment.  Selling out of this would would mark the first divestment from one of the world\u2019s oil majors by the fund, which can still invest in those that have refineries and other downstream activities, so-called integrated companies such as Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil.  Norway pools its revenues from oil and gas production into the sovereign wealth fund, which declined to say on Thursday what its stakes in ConocoPhillips and Hess were now worth or whether it had already sold them.  \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on single companies,\u201d said a spokesman for the fund, which has previously said any divestments would take place gradually and over time. The finance ministry said the fund\u2019s exclusions would track FTSE Russell\u2019s classification.  The fund\u2019s stake in Hess, which was not immediately available for comment, was 0.85% and worth $102 million at the end of 2018, when it also held $40 million of its bonds.  Norway\u2019s central bank, which manages the fund, called in 2017 for the removal of all oil and gas stocks from its benchmark index to reduce its exposure to the risk of a permanent drop in oil prices.  This proposal, which would have affected some 6% of the fund\u2019s holdings, worth around $37 billion, was rejected by the Norwegian finance ministry which instead put forward the plan adopted this week by lawmakers and affects just 1.2% of the fund\u2019s overall equity holdings.  ConocoPhillips continues to produce oil from Norway\u2019s Ekofisk field, which Phillips Petroleum discovered in 1969 and was the first oil discovery made off the Norwegian coast, kickstarting what has become the Nordic country\u2019s top industry.  Hess sold its own Norwegian offshore assets to Aker BP in 2017.","143":"(Reuters) - U.S. producer ConocoPhillips COP.N and Venezuela's PDVSA have reached a payment agreement over a $2 billion arbitration, the companies said on Monday, suspending a dispute that blocked the state-run company from exporting oil from most of its key Caribbean facilities.  The logo of Venezuelan oil company PDVSA is seen on a tank at Isla refinery in Willemstad on the island of Curacao April 22, 2018. REUTERS\/Andres Martinez Casares  The case relates to the nationalization of Conoco assets dating back over a decade in Venezuela. An international court ruled in favor of Conoco in April and ordered PDVSA to pay. But no payment has been forthcoming, leading Conoco to seize most of PDVSA\u2019s Caribbean assets as it sought to enforce its claim.  The settlement means that Conoco will suspend the legal enforcement, as long as PDVSA makes regular payments, spokesman Daren Beaudo said. He declined to say if payments would be made in cash or crude oil, adding that details of the agreement were confidential.  PDVSA confirmed the agreement in a statement, adding that the deal \u201conce again shows PDVSA\u2019s firm will to reach commercial solutions with its creditors.\u201d  The state oil company has also made progress on similar payment agreements with Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N and NuStar Energy LP NS.N, the two confirmed.  Venezuela\u2019s crude production, a major source of revenue, has fallen to a six-decade low this year as lack of investment, recession and hyperinflation have pushed the OPEC-member country\u2019s economy to near collapse.  The settlement could restore a portion of lost exports by resuming shipping from the Caribbean.  ARBITRATION CASES  Conoco asked the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) to solve a dispute on the early termination of contracts with PDVSA. The ICC ruled in favor of Conoco in April.  Separately, Conoco brought a claim against Venezuela before a World Bank court over the nationalization of two oil projects. A final ruling on that case before the World Bank\u2019s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) is possible by year end, Conoco has said.  \u201cHaving missed payments to bondholders in recent months, PDVSA could have built a cushion for paying Conoco,\u201d said Francisco Monaldi, a Latin American energy researcher at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute.  \u201cPDVSA will have a break, recovering export capacity in the Caribbean, as long as it continues paying Conoco on time. Conoco could focus now on the wider case, before ICSID,\u201d he added.  Court hearings scheduled for next month in Bonaire and Aruba could have enabled Conoco to begin selling PDVSA assets seized through court attachments. It was unclear if they would go ahead.  In Curacao, where efforts are underway to replace PDVSA as operator of the island\u2019s 335,000-barrel-per-day Isla refinery, the agreement was welcomed by the government, which would now have more options to keep the facility working.  SPLIT PAYMENT  PDVSA agreed to make an initial payment of around $500 million within 90 days of signing the agreement. The remainder is to be paid quarterly over a period of 4-1\/2 years, Conoco said in a statement.  Under a new military-led management appointed late last year, PDVSA increasingly has struggled to produce, refine and export crude oil amid a severe lack of cash, and faced sanctions imposed last year by the U.S. government.  Previous agreements by the Venezuelan government and its state-run companies over dozens of arbitrations and legal claims related to late President Hugo Chavez\u2019s nationalizations have mostly ended in renegotiations and legal disputes.  \u201cWhat makes this situation and Conoco\u2019s claim unique is the amount of creditors lining up behind the very same Venezuelan assets,\u201d Jay Auslander, partner at New-York based law firm Wilk Auslander, said.  \u201cSo Venezuela itself has ample reason to take care of the Conoco problem. How this will all play out over time, though, remains uncertain, because Venezuela may simply lack the liquidity to fully perform.\u201d  Conoco said it will make sure that the settlement meets U.S. regulatory requirements, including any applicable sanctions against Venezuela.  Conoco and Exxon Mobil XOM.N left Venezuela after they could not reach deals to convert their projects into joint ventures controlled by PDVSA. The assets were then expropriated.  After receiving two arbitration awards, Exxon said in its most recent quarterly report that the South American country this year finished paying $260 million related to its La Ceiba project.  Separately on Monday, NuStar said it had also reached an agreement with PDVSA that brings the Venezuelan company\u2019s accounts current and cover a year\u2019s worth of storage in the Caribbean.  PDVSA can resume use of the St. Eustatius terminal, NuStar spokesman Chris Cho said in a statement. The storage agreement secures future fees and improves the earnings outlook for the facility, he said.  Conoco shares rose 1 percent to $70.52 on Monday."}}
