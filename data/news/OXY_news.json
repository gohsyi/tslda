REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Occidental\u2019s venture capital arm, Oxy Low Carbon Ventures LLC, has formed a company with sustainability-focused private equity firm Rusheen Capital Management LLC to license the direct air capture (DAC) technology developed by Canada\u2019s Carbon Engineering.  Interest in DAC has grown in recent years, from companies seeking to offset their climate impact to public officials worried about the slow pace of international agreements to cut emissions.  The cost of carbon-removal technologies like DAC however is high, and they have yet to be deployed on a mass scale. Environmentalists have also argued that they reflect a lack of resolve to end the use of fossil fuels.  The new company, 1PointFive, will develop a facility located on 100 acres in Texas\u2019 Permian Basin. It aims to capture up to 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere a year, the companies said in a joint statement.  Construction will begin in 2022, allowing time to improve plant design and reduce costs. The project will seek financing in the market.  Carbon dioxide captured at the Texas facility will be stored underground and used to increase pressure in the oil field and speed up production.  The project will benefit from a federal tax credit designed to spur investment in carbon capture and sequestration projects.  Carbon Engineering has a pilot plant in British Columbia that has been operating since 2015.  The United Nations has said carbon removal technology will be necessary to limit the increase in planetary warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, the goal of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.","2":"July 22 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp on Monday criticized activist investor Carl Icahn\u2019s efforts to oust and replace four of its directors, saying his slate of nominees were inadequate for the post.  Icahn, who owns 4.4% stake in the Houston-based oil and gas producer, launched a proxy fight last week, arguing that the company overpaid for Anadarko Petroleum and failed to give shareholders a say in the proposed $38 billion deal.  The proxy fight is unlikely to stop the Anadarko deal, but would influence the pace and direction of billions of dollars of asset sales that will result after the acquisition closes.  In a letter to shareholders, Occidental Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub and Chairman Eugene Batchelder said Icahn\u2019s slate of nominees lacked \u201cskills, experience or expertise that are addititive or superior to our existing directors.\u201d  Icahn\u2019s nominees are John Hofmeister, former president of Shell Oil Co, Alan LeFevre, former finance chief of consumer goods firm Jarden Corp, and Nicholas Graziano and Andrew Langham, executives with Icahn\u2019s investment company.

Icahn sued Occidental in Delaware Court of Chancery last May seeking financial records and details of its negotiations with Anadarko. He has since committed to a proxy fight to appoint new management and accelerate asset sales to repay debt taken on with the $38 billion deal.  In a sharply worded decision, Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights wrote Icahn\u2019s complaints of Occidental mismanagement \u201cappear to be nothing more than disagreements\u201d with the company\u2019s directors and his lawsuit failed to show how the documents would advance his proxy contest.  \u201cWe intend to appeal his decision because we believe understanding what happened in the Oxy boardroom is very important to our proxy fight and for all stockholders,\u201d said Andrew Langham, general counsel for Icahn Enterprises.  Occidental did not respond to requests for comment.  Icahn last week disclosed the sale of 10 million shares of the oil and gas producer, reducing his Occidental holdings by nearly a third, according to a letter to shareholders. His stake, valued at about $1.6 billion last May, was worth about $900 million after the sale, he wrote.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The company has been struggling with debt taken on during its $38 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum last year, an ill-timed bet on oil prices rising.  The Anadarko purchase was intended to increase efficiency and profits by boosting oil and gas production. But Occidental\u2019s output will dip in the third and fourth quarters and it will end the year pumping about 1.2 million barrels of oil and gas per day, roughly 200,000 barrels per day less than the year prior.

Occidental did not release 2021 spending plans, but said it would have to spend about $2.9 billion to keep production flat, based on oil prices at $40 per barrel.  It has about $4.5 billion in notes due next year and reported long-term debt of $36 billion on June 30. Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway holds about $9.7 billion in Occidental preferred shares that pay a dividend of about 8%.

He defended the purchase, which has been attacked by activist Carl Icahn as \u201cmisguided and hugely overpriced,\u201d as providing future oil production as a good valuation. Icahn is seeking to remove and replace four directors to influence the scale and pace of asset sales.  \u201cWhen the smoke clears, people will start to see what we\u2019ve done,\u201d Burgher said to an overflow crowd.  Shares of Occidental fell 4.5% on Monday to $45.01, the lowest level in roughly a decade following a downgrade from analysts at investment firm Evercore ISI.  \u201cThe purchase of Anadarko makes Occidental larger but significantly less valuable,\u201d Evercore analysts wrote in a note to investors on Monday.  Burgher said the deal would achieve $3.5 billion in synergies and cost savings through divestitures and by eliminating redundancies, including duplicate offices.  The company plans to keep Anadarko\u2019s campus in Woodlands, Texas, indefinitely, and make a decision on the space in several years, Burgher said. It plans to remain in Houston and will sell a property that was acquired last year for a new Houston headquarters, he said.  Occidental also plans to be selective about what properties it puts on the market to help pay off the debt, he also said, saying it likes the U.S. offshore production acquired in the deal.  \u201cWe like the Gulf of Mexico (properties) we think it\u2019s a keeper; great free cash flow, great assets,\u201d he said. He made no mention of the Western Midstream Partners stake that it also acquired with Anadarko.","7":"FILE PHOTO: The logo for Occidental Petroleum is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 30, 2019.

The latest writedown stems from declining energy demand amid the COVID-19 pandemic and global glut that has oil trading 38% below what it cost in January. Occidental and many of its peers dismissed workers and cut budgets by billions of dollars as energy markets fell.  Occidental plans to replace $9.12 billion in notes due in 2021 and 2022 and issue new notes that would remove provisions that could have pushed it into default.  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N, which last year bought $10 billion of Occidental preferred shares to help it finance the Anadarko deal, will receive a June 30 dividend in shares, Occidental said, to save cash.

Occidental and Buffett were not immediately available for comment.  Ratings firm Moody\u2019s Investors Service on Thursday downgraded its rating on Occidental\u2019s debt one notch to Ba2 and issued a \u201cnegative\u201d outlook.

The Anadarko purchase left Occidental \u201cwith over $35 billion of debt and $10 billion of preferred stock, compromising its financial flexibility to confront the collapse in oil prices,\u201d said Andrew Brooks, a Moody\u2019s vice president.  This will be the third consecutive quarter in which Occidental takes a writedown, bringing the total to as much as $12 billion in the last nine months, more than half of its market capitalization.  The oil price crash has other oil and gas companies chopping the value of their assets. The industry\u2019s total reductions could reach $300 billion starting this quarter, according to accounting and consulting firm Deloitte.

Occidental is working to pare $40 billion of debt it took on with the Anadarko deal, and changes to ownership would ease a sale or spin-off of Western Midstream.  The restructuring would also allow Occidental to no longer show the gas pipeline and processing business\u2019s debt as its own.  The net long-term debt for Occidental was $47.6 billion as of Sept. 31, 2019.  The deal, which has been called \u201chugely overpriced\u201d by activist investor Carl Icahn, continues to weigh on Occidental\u2019s shares, which still trade at levels it touched during the financial downturn of 2008.  Inherited as part of the Anadarko takeover, the sale of the Western Midstream stake is a key part of Occidental\u2019s target to raise a total of $15 billion from asset sales by mid-2020.  Occidental has raised about $10.5 billion through sales of properties, including a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique and oil production elsewhere in Africa.  Western Midstream currently trades at a market value of over $9 billion.  The restructuring of the Western Midstream agreements will put Occidental back on track to hive off the business, something it tried to do unsuccessfully last year.  \u201cI don\u2019t view the plans to reduce its ownership level to below 50% in 2020 as surprising.

Moody\u2019s cut its rating on Occidental\u2019s senior unsecured debt to \u201cBa1\u201d from \u201cBaa3\u201d, a week after the company slashed its shareholder dividend and further cut its spending and production outlook for 2020.  The acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corp continues to burden Occidental\u2019s balance sheet, \u201csignificantly compromising its financial flexibility to confront the collapse in oil prices,\u201d said Andrew Brooks, vice president at Moody\u2019s.  Occidental took on $40 billion in debt from its purchase of Anadarko last year, with the deal running into a fiscal hurricane as oil prices crashed below $30 a barrel after Russia and Saudi Arabia sparked a price war earlier this year.  \u201cProjected asset sales required for debt reduction have slowed and face considerable headwinds in a challenged oil and natural gas price environment, leaving OXY with a significantly weakened credit profile whose prospects for near-term improvement are uncertain,\u201d Brooks added.  In a statement released on Wednesday, the ratings agency said it is lowering Occidental\u2019s senior unsecured shelf rating to (P)Ba1 from (P)Baa3 and its commercial paper program rating to Not Prime from Prime-3.  Last week, the world\u2019s top rating agencies warned that the sharp drop in oil prices, if sustained, could cause a wave of sovereign downgrades and heavy multi-notch rating cuts to junk-rated oil and gas firms.  Meanwhile, the coronavirus pandemic has further pressured fuel prices, cutting demand for oil and gas at a time when global supplies are rising as OPEC and Russia pump out more to regain market share from U.S. shale.

The company has been struggling with debt taken on in last year\u2019s $38 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum, an ill-timed bet on rising shale oil prices ahead of a market crash.  Wyoming\u2019s State Lands and Investment Board plans to hold a public hearing early next week to decide if it will bid on the surface and mineral properties, Gordon said.  Occidental is the largest private landowner in Wyoming, where it is focused mainly on development in the Powder River Basin. It acquired millions of mineral and surface acres in Wyoming and Colorado with the purchase of Anadarko last year, and hoped at one point to fetch as much as $700 million in the sale, according to people familiar with the offering.  Occidental declined to comment on the bidding process.  \u201cI don\u2019t think you often get opportunities like this, so it\u2019s well worth our time to investigate,\u201d Gordon, a Republican, said in an interview.  The state is working with Barclays investment bank to determine the value of the properties and what sort of income it could receive from oil and gas development, mining, grazing, hunting, solar or wind development, or tourism, said Gordon.  The decision on bidding will be based on likely investment returns, Gordon said, with money coming from the $7 billion Wyoming Permanent Mineral Trust Fund.  Occidental received 13 bids in the first round of its sales process, Chief Executive Vicki Hollub told analysts during a May 6 earnings call, adding the company expected to be able to close on that asset late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter.

REUTERS\/Jeff Zelevansky  In a regulatory filing, Icahn said he planned to oust and replace four Occidental directors and change the company\u2019s charter through a stockholder consent solicitation to prevent it from ever engineering a similar takeover again.  Responding to the filing, Occidental said it will review the latest materials filed by Icahn, and looks forward to addressing them in ongoing conversations with shareholders.  Icahn, one of industry\u2019s most powerful activist investors, cast himself as one of the deal\u2019s most fervent critics by charging that Occidental\u2019s $38 billion bid for Anadarko was too expensive and could endanger Occidental\u2019s future if oil prices sink.  The deal has been approved by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and is expected to close in the second half of the year.  Icahn\u2019s move on Wednesday put fresh pressure on Occidental\u2019s management and Chief Executive Vicki Hollub at a critical time and has sparked speculation that Occidental may try to settle with him.  \u201cIt is important to add new directors to Occidental\u2019s Board of Directors to oversee future extraordinary transactions like the Anadarko transaction and to ensure that they are not consummated without stockholder approval when appropriate,\u201d Icahn said in a statement to shareholders on Wednesday.  Icahn owned a $1.6 billion stake in Occidental as of May 30.  While the move was notable, it hardly came as a surprise as Icahn had been hinting for weeks that he might push for a special meeting where other shareholders would be able to express their frustration with management.  In May he sued Occidental in Delaware court, and earlier this week he went out of his way to criticize the Occidental-Anadarko deal while discussing the merger of major casino operators Caesars Entertainment Corp and Eldorado Resorts Inc.  \u201cThe recent Occidental Petroleum fiasco is a great example of how CEOs and boards will go to great lengths, including \u2018betting the company\u2019 to serve their own agendas,\u201d Icahn said in a statement about the Caesars-Eldorado merger. \u201cIf their bet is successful, they and possibly their shareholders win, but if it is unsuccessful, only the shareholders lose.\u201d  While Icahn has said publicly that the Occidental-Anadarko deal likely would not be derailed, his filing illustrates how he wants to make sure that nothing similar happens again.  He said Occidental lacks effective corporate governance and that its directors made mistakes in how and at what cost they pursued the acquisition of Anadarko, according to the filing.  Icahn is calling on the board to set a record date to determine which shareholders could petition to hold a special meeting.  The oil and gas producer\u2019s bid for Anadarko topped one by Chevron Corp and includes a $10 billion financing deal with Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  The merger of the two U.S. shale producers would increase Occidental\u2019s debt to around $40 billion. Icahn, in his lawsuit filed in Delaware Court of Chancery in May, sought access to the oil producer\u2019s financial records and details of negotiations.","34":"FILE PHOTO: The logo for Occidental Petroleum is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 30, 2019.

Icahn, who owns 4.4% of Occidental shares, last month said he planned to launch a proxy fight to oust and replace four Occidental directors. Icahn has blasted the Houston-based oil and gas producer for failing to give owners a say on its proposed $38 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum, which he has called \u201cmisguided and hugely overpriced.\u201d  \u201cOccidental refused to craft a compromise and so we\u2019ll happily take our case to stockholders which the company should have done with this bet-the-company transaction,\u201d Icahn told Reuters on Thursday.  \u201cWe prefer to have peace and have a great record in reaching settlements,\u201d Icahn added.  Occidental, whose board of directors has 10 members, did not respond to requests for comment. In its own recent securities filings, the company called the Icahn requests \u201cnot in the best interests of Occidental or its shareholders\u201d and urged they not sign the solicitation.  In the proxy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Icahn identified his four candidates for the board: John Hofmeister, the former president of Shell Oil Company; Alan LeFevre, the former finance chief of consumer goods firm Jarden Corp; and Nicholas Graziano and Andrew Langham, two executives with Icahn\u2019s own investment company.  Icahn spoke with Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub on July 10 in an 11th-hour effort to reach a compromise and avert a proxy fight. His associates also spoke with Occidental executives twice earlier this month, according to the filing.  If Icahn\u2019s proxy solicitation is successful in forcing a special meeting of shareholders, the record date for a vote on the Icahn candidates could be scheduled as soon as September or October.  Icahn expects to schedule meetings with Occidental shareholders in the next four weeks to press the case for board seats. The proxy fight is unlikely to stop the Anadarko deal, but would influence the pace and direction of billions of dollars of asset sales that will result after the acquisition closes.  Occidental has proposed selling Anadarko\u2019s Africa assets, including a proposed Mozambique liquefied natural gas project estimated to cost $20 billion. Anadarko also owns significant offshore wells and production platforms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.

FILE PHOTO: Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is seen in The Woodlands, Texas, U.S., April 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Loren Elliott  Occidental and Chevron Corp are battling for Anadarko and its holdings of nearly a quarter million acres in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, where low-cost production has helped turn the United States into the world\u2019s top oil producer at 12.3 million barrels per day.  Occidental shares were trading on Thursday at $57.48, down sharply from $66.63 a month ago, prior to rumors it might challenge Chevron. It trumped Chevron\u2019s bid last week, and its offer now includes $10 billion in financing from Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc in exchange for preferred shares that would pay an 8 percent dividend.  Major Occidental shareholders told Reuters they opposed the plan. They called the $76-per-share bid for Anadarko expensive and cited concerns about the cyclical nature of the oil business as well as the cost of getting financing from Buffett.  Several Occidental shareholders said they viewed Chevron\u2019s lower $65-per-share bid as a better fit because it could more easily swallow a company of Anadarko\u2019s size.  T. Rowe Price Group Inc, which holds shares in all three oil companies, cited merger risks and the cost of the Berkshire infusion. John Linehan, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, said Buffett\u2019s deal could allow Occidental to restructure its cash-and-stock deal to avoid a shareholder vote, although its current offer includes a vote.  T. Rowe Price, Occidental\u2019s sixth largest shareholder, had 21.1 million shares at the end of 2018, according to Refinitiv Eikon figures, along with 8 million Chevron shares and 865,000 Anadarko shares.  Berkshire would receive a warrant to purchase up to 80 million shares of common stock at $62.50 apiece in a private offering, in addition to the preferred stock that will accrue dividends at 8 percent per annum.  \u201cThat\u2019s very expensive paper,\u201d Linehan said of the agreement with Berkshire. \u201cThey could have borrowed far cheaper than that.\u201d  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Occidental did not respond to a request for comment on shareholder objections to the current proposal. Before the Buffett financing plan, it said the deal would result in $3.5 billion in cash flow improvements and that it would sell $10 billion to $15 billion in assets to reduce debt.  Moody\u2019s Investors Service estimated that the assumption of Anadarko\u2019s debt and additional borrowings to cover the offer would add almost $40 billion in debt to Occidental. Moody\u2019s put the company\u2019s debt rating under review for downgrade.  South Texas Money Management, which has $2.3 billion in assets under management, including shares of Chevron and Occidental, hopes Chevron prevails.  At the end of March they owned around 580,000 shares of Occidental and 370,000 shares of Chevron worth $38.5 million and $45.5 million, respectively.  \u201cRight now their bid would allow them to extract a lot of value for that deal,\u201d said Christian Ledoux, South Texas\u2019 chief investment officer.

It is the largest private landowner in Wyoming, where it is focused mainly on development in the Powder River Basin.  The sale includes about 1 million acres of land and 4 million acres in mineral rights once owned by the federal government, sold to Union Pacific Railroad and later acquired by Anadarko.

Occidental, which borrowed heavily to finance last year's $38 billion purchase of rival Anadarko Petroleum, cut the value of its oil and gas properties by $6.6 billion, joining BP, Chevron and Total in massive write-downs as the industry now expects energy prices to stay low for years.

In the Permian, where it became the largest operator through the Anadarko purchase, shale output will drop 37% this year, it said.  Shares fell nearly 6% in late trading after rising $1.03 at $16.48. The stock is down 61% so far this year.  The average price Occidental received for crude oil plummeted about 61% to $23.17 per barrel in the second quarter as oil prices crashed. It has cut jobs, slashed its dividend, reduced spending plans and sold assets to shore up its finances.  It expects to receive $2 billion or more in asset sales, according to the presentation.  Among the assets Occidental is trying to sell is a package of land and minerals in Wyoming and Colorado. The company has said that it hopes to close that sale in the fourth quarter.

A sharp decline in oil prices due to the coronavirus pandemic has sparked a wave of contract disputes as producers shut-in wells to manage the drop in demand. Shale major Continental Resources drew anger after it declared force majeure on some contracts in April, and marketer Eighty-Eight Oil LLC made a similar move after it fell short on barrels it committed to sell.  Houston-based MidCon said Occidental owes it $1.1 million for past crude deliveries, according to a lawsuit filed in a Texas District Court. A dispute arose after MidCon declared force majeure because it was unable to source all of the 7,000 barrels per day it had committed to sell to Occidental. The company blamed well shut-ins, as well as a court-ordered shut-in imposed on one supplier.  MidCon was eventually able to source the barrels it committed to Occidental, and agreed to make up May deliveries that fell short in June, as long as Occidental agreed to provide a letter of credit or prepayment ahead of the delivery.  Occidental refused to provide any such assurance, and so MidCon halted all deliveries, prompting Occidental to withhold payment.  Some producers have been selling at discounted rates after failing to deliver contractual volumes in previous months when they shut wells, in order to avoid legal disputes with buyers, market sources said.  Refiners and purchasers have sought to rework some lease purchase agreements to avoid being cut off from supplies unexpectedly if prices plunge again.

Occidental had previously dismissed his candidates as inadequate.  The activist investor owns nearly $2 billion in shares of oil and gas producer Occidental, and last month launched a battle to remove four Occidental directors and replace them with his own, four-person slate.

FILE PHOTO: Vicki Hollub, President and CEO of Occidental Petroleum, speaks at the 2019 Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., April 29, 2019. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  Occidental, which recently purchased oil producer Anadarko Petroleum in $38 billion deal, is advancing its use of technologies to capture carbon, and prevent the element from escaping into the atmosphere.  To make this a reality on a large scale, though, legislative change is needed, Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub told nearly 200 investors, government leaders and carbon sequestration companies at an Oil and Gas Climate Initiative investments conference in Chicago.  While Congress has adopted tax credits for sequestration products, new laws are needed to support development of carbon sequestration infrastructure, she said.  She urged attendees to call on Congress to support legislation to facilitate the permitting and development of carbon capture sequestration projects and carbon dioxide pipelines.  Such a bill could give gives carbon sequestration technology a funding boost similar to what solar, wind and other technologies have already received.  Carbon sequestration technology works by trapping carbon in caverns or porous spaces underground.  Occidental injects 2.6 billion cubic feet per day of CO2 in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico to aid in extraction of crude oil, according to the company\u2019s website. The excess CO2 is recovered and reinjected until it largely becomes trapped underground.  Oxy will expand its efforts to capture carbon, use it in oil extraction and other processes, and store it, offsetting emissions from oil production and use, she said.  \u201cThere\u2019s no way to cap global warming without significant sequestration and use of CO2,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is part of our strategy. It\u2019s got to happen in a big way.\u201d.  Expanding carbon capture, use and sequestration will ultimately make the company\u2019s global oil output carbon neutral, and not just in shale formations, Hollub said.  She said the company previously had a timeline for becoming carbon neutral, but is still adjusting the plans to reflect its Anadarko purchase. She said the industry\u2019s move to carbon neutrality will take decades.  Skeptics have questioned carbon capture and sequestration but said it is needed to bring oil production to zero emissions, Hollub added.  \u201cAs much as some people want oil and gas to go away in the next couple of decades, it cannot,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we can do is make sure all companies have access to these technologies.\u201d","50":"Sept 14 (Reuters) - Colombian oil company Ecopetrol aims to drill 100 wells by the end of 2021 in the Permian Basin of West Texas, the company\u2019s chief executive Felipe Bayon said on Monday.

Core income fell to $729 million, or 97 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $848 million, or $1.10 per share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting the company to report earnings of 93 cents a share on the same basis, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. (bit.ly\/32VraOa)  Among its major businesses, operating profit in oil and gas fell 7% to $726 million, chemicals fell 34% to $208 million and earnings from its pipeline unit rose 32% to $331 million, compared with year-ago figures.  Profits were hurt by $107 million in one-time costs, including Anadarko-related transaction and debt financing fees.  Daily average oil and gas production was 741,000 barrels per day (bpd), up from 639,000 bpd a year earlier. Higher production was offset by weaker prices, with the realized price for its oil and U.S. natural gas off 6.7% and 85%, respectively, from a year earlier.  The company plans to hold a conference call with analysts on Thursday to discuss the results.  Icahn this month launched a campaign to unseat four Occidental directors, arguing they entered into the deal for Anadarko to preclude Occidental from becoming a takeover target. He has attacked the deal as too pricy and for the lack of an Occidental shareholder vote.  The company also said it has formed a drilling partnership with Colombia's state-run oil company Ecopetrol SA ECO.CN to develop its acreage in the Midland portion of the Permian shale field for up to $1.5 billion. Occidental said the agreement, which it expects to conclude in late 2019, would allow it to accelerate development plans.  Ecopetrol said the joint venture would add some 160 million barrels of crude to its proven reserves, an about 10% increase on last year\u2019s figure. It also will allow the Colombian company to gradually increase its net production to 95,000 bpd in 2027, it added.  In its last earnings report before shareholders vote on the sale on Aug. 8, Anadarko also beat analysts\u2019 estimates for quarterly profit as higher production offset lower prices for its oil.","61":"(Corrects to say one-time gain was from sale of assets, not tax gain, in headline and first paragraph.)

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Shares rose 14.6% on Tuesday to $14.34 after the cuts were disclosed. On Monday, the U.S. oil producer\u2019s market value fell to $12 billion, less than a third of the $38 billion it paid last August for rival Anadarko Petroleum, an ill-timed bet on continued growth of U.S. shale.  That deal ran into a fiscal hurricane with oil prices diving as much as 42% this year. OPEC and Russia launched an oil-price war over the weekend to regain market share from U.S. shale.  The oil price collapse left Occidental with about $40 billion in debt and dwindling means of covering operating expenses after the $2.8 billion dividend and interest costs.  The reduced dividend on common shares and as much as $1.9 billion in new spending cuts will save the company a combined $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion a year.  With the cuts, Occidental can finance its expenses with oil in the low-$30 a barrel range, Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said in a statement. Global benchmark Brent crude was trading around $37 a barrel on Tuesday, with U.S. crude below $35 a barrel.  \u201cI\u2019m not surprised about the dividend cut because she has broken her pledges so many times in the past,\u201d said activist investor Carl Icahn, who has been waging a bitter battle against Occidental.  Icahn, who held about 22.6 million Occidental shares at end of 2019, has criticized the deal as a misplaced bet on oil prices rising and has promised a proxy fight to win control of the company. He told Reuters he was glad Hollub had not been replaced, saying: \u201cif they fired her the stock would have gone up considerably, and I\u2019ve been thinking of buying.\u201d  Occidental declined to make Hollub available for an interview. Less than two weeks ago, she had called the dividend \u201cone of the defining characteristics of our company,\u201d and pledged to defend it. Occidental last cut its dividend in 1991.  \u201cWe were dumbstruck by today\u2019s announcement,\u201d said Occidental investor David Katz, president of Matrix Asset Advisors, who also wants to see board and management changes at Occidental. The company has about 40% of this year\u2019s production hedged, but \u201cfolded two days after oil prices sold off,\u201d Katz said.  The company did not say how much its oil and gas production would be affected by the spending cuts. Occidental pumps about 1.4 million barrels of oil and gas per day, but could see \u201ca low-to-mid single digit production decline over the next 12 months,\u201d said Pavel Molchanov, analyst with Raymond James.  An Occidental spokesman declined to say whether the company has approached Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Warren Buffett, who holds $10 billion in Occidental preferred shares, about the dividend cut or forbearance on its payments.  Occidental slashed the common stock dividend to 44 cents a share annually from $3.16 a share, after investors called for a cut, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The savings \u201cshould help stabilize the company in the medium to long term, said Matt Portillo, an analyst with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. He said even with the cuts, Occidental\u2019s high debt remains the \u201coverriding concern.\u201d  The company said its latest cuts will bring 2020 capital spending down about 60% from last year, to between $3.5 and $3.7 billion. It will implement additional cost-cutting measures.","64":"BOSTON (Reuters) - Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services on Thursday urged Occidental Petroleum Corp shareholders to ask management to let them weigh in on board and governance issues as the company buys rival Anadarko Petroleum Corp..

The note, written by Cristiano Guerra, who heads ISS\u2019s Special Situations Research Group, also says ISS is not backing Icahn\u2019s nominees or planned changes.  Occidental said it disagreed with ISS\u2019s recommendation that shareholders should take the first step and request the fixing of a Record Date for the consent solicitation and only later focus on whether the Icahn Group\u2019s proposals would harm or further shareholder interests.  \u201cThe Board of Directors has unanimously determined that fixing a Record Date for the Icahn Group\u2019s planned consent solicitation and the proposals the Icahn Group intends to ask shareholders to act on are NOT in the best interests of Occidental or our shareholders,\u201d the company said in a statement.  Shareholders were prevented from commenting on the company\u2019s \u201ctransformational and controversial transaction\u201d with Anadarko, the ISS note said, and should be given a voice on such issues before next year\u2019s annual general meeting. \u201cThere seems to be sufficient reason to address these concerns now, rather than waiting until the 2020 AGM.\u201d  A week ago Icahn, a who owns 4.4% of Occidental and has become the most vocal critic of the $38 billion takeover of Anadarko, filed a solicitation statement with U.S. regulators. He wants to replace four board members with two of his employees and two executives who have financial and oil industry expertise.  Icahn has criticized Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub for the company\u2019s financial record and for seeking outside financing for the deal from billionaire investor Warren Buffett that did not require shareholder approval.  In order to provide consent, Occidental\u2019s investors, including mutual fund firm T. Rowe Price among others, must provide a Record Date Request Form and answer a questionnaire that includes their trading history in Occidental stock. They also must instruct their Depository Trust Company to take actions on their behalf.  Because shareholders cannot vote on this transaction, \u201calong with the self-evident complexity of the consent solicitation process, suggests that a more open and thorough debate regarding Occidental\u2019s strategic direction and overall governance would be beneficial,\u201d the ISS note said.","65":"NEW ORLEANS, March 27 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp expects its Permian shale division to be cash flow breakeven by the third quarter, six months ahead of schedule, its chief executive said on Tuesday.

Occidental said average worldwide realized crude oil prices rose 36 percent to $62.67 per barrel in the third quarter.  The company, which has been investing heavily to boost production in the Permian, said output from its Permian Resources unit surged about 62 percent to 225,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe\/d).  Occidental\u2019s average production rose about 13.5 percent to 681,000 boe\/d.  However, the company lowered the top end of its full-year forecast for total output to between 655,000 boe\/d and 659,000 boe\/d, from 650,000 boe\/d and 664,000 boe\/d.  Sales in Occidental\u2019s chemical division rose 10.6 percent to $1.19 billion, helped by demand for caustic soda. The division, the company\u2019s second biggest, makes plastics used in pipes and siding.  The Houston-based company's net income surged to $1.87 billion, or $2.44 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $190 million, or 25 cents per share, a year earlier. (bit.ly\/2qutMkh)  In the latest quarter, the company had an after-tax gain on the sale of midstream assets of about $700 million.  Excluding one-time items, Occidental earned $1.77 per share topping analysts\u2019 estimates of $1.54 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Shares of the company rose about 1 percent in after-hours trading.  The company will hold a conference call with investors to discuss the results on Tuesday.

REUTERS\/Nick Oxford  (Reuters) - The value of U.S. oil and gas mergers and acquisitions reached a five-year peak of $96 billion in 2019 on the back of competing bids for Anadarko Petroleum, energy data provider Enverus said on Thursday.  Occidental Petroleum Corp's OXY.N $38 billion acquisition of Permian rival Anadarko countered a pullback in corporate deal-making the sector, driven by investor pressure to prioritize shareholder returns over growth, Enverus said.  Occidental last year won a takeover battle for Anadarko, topping Chevron Corp's CVX.N $33 billion offer, after Berkshire Hathaway Inc's BRKa.N Warren Buffett and France's Total SA TOTF.PA came to its aid.  Without that acquisition, the total value of deals in 2019 would have been $39.1 billion, well below the $85 billion recorded in 2018, according to Enverus. The data provider valued the Anadarko deal at $57 billion, including debt taken on by the acquirer.  \u201cInvestors who funded the shale revolution over the last decade have become vocal in advocating for payouts and cut back on providing new capital. That flowed through to limited M&A and a negative reaction to deals for much of the year,\u201d said Andrew Dittmar, senior M&A analyst at Enverus.  However, the total M&A spend in 2019 was the highest since 2014, when oil prices peaked at $112 per barrel before beginning a slump that saw prices drop by half of that.  Most of the last year\u2019s marquee deals focused on the Permian basin of Texas and New Mexico, which is at the heart of the shale boom that has helped the United States become the world\u2019s biggest producer of crude oil.  Enverus predicts M&A would rise this year, after ticking up in the fourth quarter of 2019, as smaller players with good land but less access to capital are gobbled up by those with free cash flow.  Apart from Occidental-Anadarko, 2019's largest corporate deals in the sector were Callon Petroleum Co's CPE.N $2.7 billion merger with Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc, WPX Energy Inc's WPX.N $2.5 billion buy of Felix Energy, and Parsley Energy Inc's PE.N $2.3 billion acquisition of Jagged Peak Energy JAG.N.","85":"July 2 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp on Tuesday called on its shareholders to reject here activist investor Carl Icahn's moves to launch a proxy fight for four seats on the company's board.

Icahn\u2019s use of a consent solicitation to elect directors would require a majority of shares outstanding to be voted in favor, a greater hurdle than a special meeting of shareholders, according to an Occidental spokesman. Occidental has urged shareholders to reject the activist\u2019s proxy, calling the request \u201cnot in the best interests of Occidental or its shareholders\u201d.  If Icahn\u2019s solicitation is successful, the record date for a vote on the Icahn candidates could be scheduled as soon as September or October.

Icahn spoke with Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub on July 10 in an 11th-hour effort to reach a compromise and avert a proxy fight. His associates also spoke with Occidental executives twice earlier this month, according to the filing.  The investor expects to schedule meetings with Occidental shareholders in the next four weeks to press the case for board seats. The proxy fight is unlikely to stop the Anadarko deal, but would influence the pace and direction of billions of dollars of asset sales that will result after the acquisition closes.

Anadarko also owns significant offshore wells and production platforms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.

Occidental has been forced to slash jobs, production and the value of its assets after the pandemic hammered energy demand, piling pressure on a company that had taken on significant debt to acquire Anadarko Petroleum for $38 billion last year.  The oil producer, which announced in June it would restructure some debt to avoid a possible default, said its total long-term net debt stood at $35.9 billion at September-end, slightly lower than $36.03 billion at the end of June.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  (Reuters) - Midstream marketing firm MidCon Gathering LLC is suing Occidental Petroleum, alleging the shale giant did not pay for crude deliveries, the latest dispute to arise from production shut-ins prompted by a crash in oil prices this year.  A sharp decline in oil prices due to the coronavirus pandemic has sparked a wave of contract disputes as producers shut-in wells to manage the drop in demand. Shale major Continental Resources drew anger after it declared force majeure on some contracts in April, and marketer Eighty-Eight Oil LLC made a similar move after it fell short on barrels it committed to sell.  Houston-based MidCon said Occidental owes it $1.1 million for past crude deliveries, according to a lawsuit filed in a Texas District Court.  A dispute arose after MidCon declared force majeure because it was unable to source all of the 7,000 barrels per day it had committed to sell to Occidental. The company blamed well shut-ins, as well as a court-ordered shut-in imposed on one supplier.  MidCon was eventually able to source the barrels it committed to Occidental, and agreed to make up May deliveries that fell short in June, as long as Occidental agreed to provide a letter of credit or prepayment ahead of the delivery.  Occidental refused to provide any such assurance, and so MidCon halted all deliveries, prompting Occidental to withhold payment.  Some producers have been selling at discounted rates after failing to deliver contractual volumes in previous months when they shut wells, in order to avoid legal disputes with buyers, market sources said.  Refiners and purchasers have sought to rework some lease purchase agreements to avoid being cut off from supplies unexpectedly if prices plunge again.  Occidental declined to comment and MidCon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","96":"The logo for Occidental Petroleum is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 30, 2019.

Occidental also expects synergy realizations to lower overhead expenses to $2.2 billion in 2020 and maintained its annual production growth forecast at 2% for the year.","100":"May 8 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp:  * OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM - RAISED 2018 GUIDANCE  * OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM SEES Q2 OIL & GAS SEGMENT TOTAL PRODUCTION OF 628 MBOED \u2013 648 MBOED  * OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM SEES 2018 OIL & GAS SEGMENT TOTAL PRODUCTION OF 645 \u2013 665 MBOED  * OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM SEES 2018 OIL & GAS SEGMENT PERMIAN RESOURCES PRODUCTION OF 198 \u2013 210 MBOED  * OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM SEES Q2 OIL & GAS SEGMENT PERMIAN RESOURCES PRODUCTION OF 188 \u2013 198 MBOED  * OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM SEES 2018 OIL & GAS SEGMENT INTERNATIONAL PRODUCTION OF 289 \u2013 295 MBOED  * OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORP - SEES FY 2018 PRODUCTION COST FOR DOMESTIC OIL & GAS ABOUT $12.50\/ BOE  * OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM SEES Q2 OIL & GAS SEGMENT INTERNATIONAL PRODUCTION OF 281 \u2013 290 MBOED  * OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORP - SEES CHEMICAL SEGMENT ABOUT $300 MILLION PRE-TAX INCOME IN 2Q18E  * OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORP - SEES FOR CHEMICAL SEGMENT ABOUT $1,100 MILLION PRE-TAX INCOME IN FY 2018E  * OCCIDENTAL ON OUTLOOK FOR MIDLAND TO GULF COAST - POSSIBLE PIPELINE CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS (LATE 2018\/ EARLY 2019 PENDING NEW PROJECT IN-SERVICE DATES)  * OCCIDENTAL ON OUTLOOK FOR MIDLAND TO GULF COAST SAYS PIPELINE CONSTRAINTS WILL REQUIRE RAIL AND TRUCK UTILIZATION Source text: (bit.ly\/2FVrQqb) Further company coverage:","101":"FILE PHOTO: The Occidental Petroleum Corp headquarters is pictured in Los Angeles, California September 16, 2013.

Energy companies worldwide, including Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N and Royal Dutch Shell PLC RDSa.L, have slashed capital expenditures and oil output to reckon with the pandemic.  Houston-based Occidental last week posted a $2 billion quarterly loss and has slashed capital spending drastically to shore up its balance sheet.

Occidental avoided its own shareholder vote on the deal by securing a controversial $10 billion financing agreement with Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway, which allowed it to raise the cash portion of its offer.  While an Anadarko holders\u2019 vote for the proposed deal is very likely, the price has angered several Occidental investors, including billionaire activist Carl Icahn, who has called for a special meeting to replace four Occidental directors.  Icahn\u2019s demand for Occidental seats seeks to influence the pace and scale of its future asset sales. He has attacked the Anadarko deal as \u201chugely overpriced\u201d and criticized Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub\u2019s agreements with Berkshire Hathaway and Total SA that are designed to help finance the purchase.  Anadarko holders would receive about $73.46 for each of their shares, a 57% premium over the stock\u2019s closing stock price on April 11, the day before Anadarko said it had a merger agreement with Chevron Corp; Chevron was later outmaneuvered by Occidental. Anadarko closed at $71.98 on Thursday.  With Anadarko\u2019s nearly quarter million acres in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, Occidental would command 1.64 million acres of prime drilling and gain access to fields in Colorado and Wyoming.  Hollub has promised to quickly shed most of Anadarko\u2019s non-U.S. oil properties to focus on shale.

Global oil prices have dropped 60% since January as fuel demand has plunged because of the coronavirus pandemic that threatens to cause a global recession and as Saudi Arabia and Russia plan to increase supply to grab market share.  Occidental has pared spending on production, cut its shareholder dividend, dismissed staff and sold assets to avoid being overwhelmed by the debt taken on to pay for its $38 billion acquisition of rival Anadarko Petroleum.  The deal was an ill-timed bet on rising oil prices that soured within months of the deal\u2019s closing. Crude oil traded at $27.64 a barrel Wednesday morning in Asia, below the level that Occidental recently said it needs to cover expenses.  \u201cDuring this unprecedented time impacting our industry, and the global economy, we\u2019re taking aggressive actions to ensure the health of the company while protecting jobs,\u201d company spokeswoman Melissa Schoeb said in a statement.  \u201cWe notified our employees of a number of measures we will be implementing, including compensation reductions, which will impact everyone at the company starting with the management team,\u201d she wrote.  Occidental will cut the salaries for some U.S. employees who earn more than $76,000 a year by up to 30% effective April 1, according to the memo and employee comments on website thelayoff.com discussing the salary cuts.  The pay of Chief Executive Vicki Hollub, who championed the Anadarko acquisition and convinced Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett to invest $10 billion in the deal, will fall 81%. Salaries of other top executives will be reduced by an average of 68%, the memo said.  Some workers who joined the company from Anadarko and are protected by terms of the acquisition agreement, will see their salaries lowered by 4.9%.  The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on the pay cuts.  The reductions follow two cuts to its 2020 capital budget and an 86% reduction in its shareholder payout. After those cuts, the company said it would be able to cover its expenses with oil in the low-$30 a barrel range.  Still, Moody\u2019s Investors Service dropped Occidental\u2019s debt rating to non-investment grade last week, warning the rating could be lowered further.

Robert Peterson, Occidental\u2019s finance chief, said in a conference call on Wednesday the company is considering raising new cash, swapping debt for stock and refinancing existing debt because of collapsing oil demand.

When an analyst asked if refinancing markets were available to the company, Peterson said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d  The company expects to book $2 billion from asset sales in the near term, Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said, adding that it could sell some assets or do oil joint ventures in its Permian Basin or Rocky Mountains properties to raise money.  Future stock-for-debt swaps or use of stock to pay preferred dividends to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N, which helped Occidental finance the purchase of Anadarko, could cause an ownership change under Internal Revenue Service rules, it said in a securities filing.  The book value of $44 billion in oil-and-gas properties it acquired could be reduced this quarter due to the decline in oil prices, it also said. They include Anadarko properties acquired when U.S. oil CLc1 was selling at $51 a barrel; it is now at about $24.  Occidental hired investment bankers Moelis & Co to advise on its debt, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. While the bulk of that debt comes due beginning next year, it may face a $992 million call in October from noteholders, according to Wednesday\u2019s securities filing.  A planned sale of its Algerian oil and gas properties to France's Total SA TOTF.PA was canceled. Occidental will have to reclassify those as continuing operations, which could hurt second-quarter results, Rowland said.  It is pursuing a sale of other assets in Ghana, a deal that had been held up, but that the transaction now is riskier in the current environment, Hollub said.","109":"(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp, which is locked in a battle with activist investor Carl Icahn, plans to make it easier for shareholders to call special meetings and would create new board committees, according to securities documents filed Thursday.

We are the rightful owners,\u201d Hollub said at the company\u2019s annual general meeting.  Shareholders including T. Rowe Price, Occidental\u2019s sixth-largest, showed displeasure by announcing they planned to vote against the board. Directors were elected with between 70 percent and 82 percent of votes cast, below the average 97 percent that directors received a year ago.  There were no questions asked at the meeting, which took place with fewer than 100 people in attendance and lasted less than an hour. Occidental\u2019s shares on Friday closed at a 10-year low of $54.97, down from $62.35 the day before Occidental disclosed its offer for Anadarko.  Several big holders have criticized Hollub\u2019s decision to boost the cash portion of the $76-per-share offer to a point where a shareholder vote is no longer needed.  Hollub said it took just an hour and a half to reach an agreement with Berkshire Hathaway Inc\u2019s Buffett on the $10 billion investment. \u201cThe timing was critical for us to close these funds,\u201d she said.  Addressing investor criticism that the Berkshire investment\u2019s 8 percent dividend was too high, she said Occidental took the premium into account when calculating returns on the Anadarko purchase.  Unless another suitor appears, the $38 billion, mostly cash deal would cement Occidental\u2019s status as the largest oil producer in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field. Occidental\u2019s global production would double to 1.4 million barrels of oil and gas per day.  Hollub has promised to quickly shed most of Anadarko\u2019s non-U.S. oil properties to focus on shale. Occidental also must absorb or sell Anadarko\u2019s U.S. Gulf of Mexico offshore production.  With Anadarko\u2019s nearly quarter million acres in the Permian Basin, Occidental would command 1.64 million acres of prime land in the Permian and gain access to growing shale fields in Colorado and Wyoming.  The deal\u2019s financial and operating risks have soured some big Occidental holders including T. Rowe Price and Matrix Asset Management.  \u201cOn paper, at $65-per-barrel oil, the deal could be executed well. That sort of is turning a blind eye to the fact that they\u2019re in a cyclical industry,\u201d said David Katz, president of Matrix.  Rating firm Moody\u2019s Investors Service said Wednesday it likely would downgrade Occidental if it prevails due to the added debt that will make it harder for the company to confront a downturn in oil prices.  \u201cIf you do this you have a strained balance sheet, period,\u201d said Christian Ledoux, investment chief at Occidental shareholder South Texas Money Management.  Hollub, who has sought to buy Anadarko for two years, proved her ability to sweep away hurdles when Anadarko\u2019s board initially agreed to sell to Chevron at a lower price. \u201cWe were not about to let that happen,\u201d Hollub said.  She convinced Berkshire Hathaway Inc\u2019s Warren Buffett to invest $10 billion in Occidental stock to help close the deal.  France\u2019s Total SA separately agreed to buy all of Anadarko\u2019s oil-and-gas producing assets outside the United States, including its biggest future expense, a multibillion-dollar liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique, for $8.8 billion.","111":"FILE PHOTO: Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is seen in The Woodlands, Texas, U.S., April 30, 2019.

The logo of Occidental Petroleum is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The move means Occidental shareholders who oppose the bid, including T Rowe Price, will not get an opportunity to vote it down. It adds more certainty to the offer for Anadarko, but also risks the ire of billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who sources have said has been amassing a stake in Occidental to challenge its Anadarko offer.  Occidental is trying to convince Anadarko to accept its offer and abandon the agreed $33 billion sale to Chevron Corp.  Anadarko confirmed that it received the revised bid from Occidental and said its board will review the proposal.  The merger agreement with Chevron remains in effect, Anadarko said and reaffirmed its existing recommendation of the deal with Chevron at this time.  Earlier on Sunday, France\u2019s Total SA said it has agreed with Occidental to buy the African assets of Anadarko for $8.8 billion, should the two U.S. oil and gas companies clinch a deal to combine. This removes the risk of Occidental not being able to shed Anadarko assets it considers non-core to the deal.  On Tuesday, Occidental also secured a $10 billion investment from Warren Buffet\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc in support of its bid for Anadarko. The terms of that deal were seen as particularly favorable to Buffett by analysts and investors.  Occidental submitted a new $76 per share offer to Anadarko on Sunday structured as 78 percent cash and 22 percent stock, as opposed to an even cash\/stock split in its $76 per share offer previously.  This brought the number of Occidental shares required to fund the bid below the issuance threshold that would have triggered a vote on the deal by Occidental shareholders. Anadarko shareholders would still get to vote on the deal.  The bidding war for Anadarko underscores the value of its assets in the lucrative Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. The vast shale field holds oil and gas deposits that can produce supplies for decades using low-cost drilling techniques.  \u201cThe financial support of Berkshire Hathaway as well as the agreement we announced with Total allows us to delever our balance sheet while focusing our integration efforts on the assets that will provide the most value for us,\u201d Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said in a statement announcing the amended terms.  However, a request made on Thursday evening by Anadarko\u2019s counsel for three board seats in the merged entity had not been granted, Occidental added.  Should Occidental\u2019s bid be declared superior by Anadarko, Chevron will be given four days to match Occidental\u2019s offer, according to the terms of the contract between Chevron and Anadarko.  Should Anadarko abandon Chevron for Occidental, it will have to pay Chevron a $1 billion deal breakup fee.  The proposed sale of Anadarko\u2019s African assets to Total includes a 26.5 percent interest in a Mozambique liquefied natural gas project, which is moving closer to a final investment decision, and stakes in two offshore fields in Ghana.  Occidental said this does not impact the planned $2 billion of annual cost savings and $1.5 billion of annual capital reductions already outlined as part of its potential acquisition of Anadarko.  Total\u2019s previously outlined plan to increase its dividend by 10 percent and buy back 5 million shares by the end of 2020 will not be impacted by the deal, the French company said in a separate statement.  Chevron declined to comment on the Occidental move or say whether it will change its $65-a-share bid.  Separately, Occidental said its first-quarter adjusted profit fell 10.9 percent as lower prices for its crude hurt oil and gas revenue.  Adjusted profit fell to $631 million, or 84 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $708 million, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier.  Production rose 18 percent to 719,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, Occidental said.  Its Permian Resources unit saw output rising 47 percent year-over-year to 261,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","116":"FILE PHOTO: The logo for Occidental Petroleum is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 30, 2019.

Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $3.8 billion, or $4.07 cents per share, for the three months, compared with a loss of $912 million, or $1.08 cents per share, a year earlier.","119":"NEW YORK\/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp has emerged as one of the biggest exporters of U.S. shale oil, rivaling large trading firms and oil majors, in a market now worth more than $150 million every day.  FILE PHOTO: Equipment used to process carbon dioxide, crude oil and water is seen at an Occidental Petroleum Corp enhanced oil recovery project in Hobbs, New Mexico, U.S. on May 3, 2017. REUTERS\/Ernest Scheyder\/File Photo  It is showing no signs of slowing down, with plans to double crude exports by 2020. In 2017, Occidental was the largest exporter from the U.S. Gulf Coast of crude produced in the Permian oilfield of Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oil field.  In 2018, it was among the top three exporters of U.S. crude, according to customs data analyzed by Reuters and interviews with company executives and employees.  U.S. crude exports have emerged as a major profit center for oil companies, as shipments have skyrocketed after Washington lifted a decades-long ban of exports in late 2015. They have expanded faster than many expected, to a record at about 3.6 million bpd last month. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/2F0CVck)  The U.S. production boom has upended global supply and overwhelmed efforts by OPEC to restrict output. U.S. exports have doubled from the end of 2017, a lucrative opportunity for companies with access to supply and export terminals.  Occidental plans to double crude exports to 600,000 barrels per day by 2020, Cynthia Walker, senior vice president midstream and marketing, said in an interview.  \u201cAs we move into the end of this year and early in 2020 ... we\u2019ll probably see a doubling of exports over that period of time,\u201d she said.  Company-level data on exports is kept secret, and the U.S. Census Bureau does not provide data, citing a law which protects confidentiality.  Occidental exports about 300,000 bpd of oil, roughly 10 percent of U.S. crude exports, a standout among the myriad trading houses, oil producers and shippers with operations in the Permian.  According to limited U.S. Customs data available on Refinitiv Eikon, other top shippers included Koch Supply and Trading, BP Plc\u2019s trading arm and Trafigura AG.  Occidental produces significant volumes of oil in the Permian, and its marketing arm buys barrels from other Permian shale producers. It also has contracts for long-term shipments on pipelines and access to storage and export terminals.  \u201cWe touch anywhere between 20 and 25 percent of every barrel that\u2019s produced in the Permian basin,\u201d Walker said.  EXPORT BOOM BRINGS OPPORTUNITY  U.S. oil production has risen by more than 2 million bpd in the last 12 months, also to an all-time high of over 12 million bpd, according to U.S. Energy Department data. Given the country consumes several million barrels more than that daily, many analysts had expected slower growth.  Companies are scrambling to build Gulf Coast ports to handle more than 3 million bpd in new supplies expected over the next five years.  Profits at Occidental\u2019s midstream and marketing segment, which includes exports, surged more than 17-fold to $1.9 billion in 2018, excluding items, mostly thanks to moving crude from the Permian to the refining and export hub in the Gulf Coast.  Still, as oil retreated to around $50 a barrel last year, Occidental shares tracked that weakness and ended 2018 down more than 15 percent.  Occidental\u2019s rivals last year ran into bottlenecks trying to get barrels from Permian to the Gulf Coast for export due to scant pipeline access. Regional prices slumped, even as the price of U.S. oil futures rose to more than $75 a barrel at one point. The bottleneck has since eased as companies expanded pipelines.  Occidental\u2019s marketing arm has a 10-year service agreement with BridgeTex pipeline, a key conduit to move crude from the Permian.  The company secured a deal for 200,000 bpd of space in 2012 and has helped finance the line\u2019s construction. Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub said during an earnings call last year that Occidental needed to partner with Magellan Midstream to build the line, and it has had access ever since.  Last year, Oxy not only sent its own barrels, but bought those of others, using its marketing arm. Occidental Energy Marketing accounted for 17 percent of rival Permian producer Pioneer Natural Resources Co\u2019s oil and gas revenues in 2018, according to regulatory filings. Occidental also represented 34 percent of sales from barrels Pioneer buys from other companies.  The company also had the advantage of owning and operating a terminal in Ingleside, Corpus Christi, which it bought in 2012. Oxy began testing supertanker export capabilities in 2017. It later sold the terminal to Moda Midstream but retained a 10-year contract for 450,000 bpd of exports there.  The company has the ability to send about 470,000 bpd out of the Permian via pipelines and expects to add more capacity in 2019, Hollub said at an industry conference last year.  In December, the port partially loaded its first supertanker: Nasiriyah chartered by Occidental for Europe. This helped slash costs for ship-to-ship transfers, a costly endeavor that has limited U.S. exports because most Gulf terminals are not deep enough to handle the supertankers, known as Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) which can transport 2 million barrels of oil.  \u201cWe don\u2019t worry at all about access,\u201d Walker said, adding that the company has a 75-cent per barrel advantage on loading costs due to the loading efficiencies at the Ingleside terminal.  To boost its export capability, Moda is expanding its storage and considering building a second berth for VLCCs.  \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get as much to the Gulf and get it out of there,\u201d a source at Occidental said.  He added: \u201cWe have the place that is easily accessible - at Ingleside - that really is what they\u2019re using to market to these foreign players in Asia.\u201d","120":"(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp said on Thursday it had restored a major portion of its chief executive officer\u2019s base salary, nearly a year after its management and employees were to forced to take a pay cut to battle one of the industry\u2019s worst downturns.  CEO Vicki Hollub\u2019s salary was restored to $1 million, effective Jan. 1, 2021, with the move coming at a time when U.S. crude prices have touched a year high and are near $60 per barrel.  Hollub\u2019s salary of $1.35 million was slashed by 81% in March, while the base salary of executives was capped at $250,000. In July, however, the company approved a partial restoration by capping salaries at $500,000 limit.  Rival Pioneer Natural Resources reinstated its CEO\u2019s pay in November.  While oil and gas workers are still among the highest paid in the world, salaries in the sector are closely tied to oil prices, which plunged last year as coronavirus-induced lockdowns slashed demand for fuel.  Houston, Texas-based Occidental is expected to report a loss of 59 cents per share, when it reports its fourth-quarter results on Tuesday, according to Refinitiv IBES data.","121":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum snatched up some of the richest shale oilfields in Texas when it beat out rival Chevron Corp in a bidding war to acquire Anadarko Petroleum.  FILE PHOTO: Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is seen in The Woodlands, Texas, U.S., April 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Loren Elliott\/File Photo  It also quadrupled its debt - to $40 billion - at a time when investors are calling for spending cuts and higher dividends.  That means the acquisition\u2019s success will depend on how quickly Occidental can sell off some of Anadarko\u2019s assets and focus on optimizing and integrating the assets it keeps - especially prime U.S. shale fields.  Shedding debt will require selling assets when deals have been sluggish, said bankers and merger specialists. The number of U.S. deals has fallen to lows not seen in five years or more as investor demands for capital discipline have driven buyers from the market, said Todd Dittmann, managing director at investment firm Angelo Gordon.  \u201cAn acquisition is more often viewed as a confession of poor drilling locations and a failure of prior strategy,\u201d Dittmann said.  Deal-makers say Chief Executive Vicki Hollub\u2019s most likely sale prospects are Anadarko\u2019s offshore assets in the Gulf of Mexico and its pipeline business. Her challenge will be to balance such sales with the need for their cash flow to pay debt and dividends.  Hollub already has one big sale lined up: France\u2019s Total SA agreed to pay $8.8 billion for Anadarko\u2019s oil-and-gas producing assets outside the United States, including its biggest future expense, a multibillion-dollar liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique.  Occidental declined to comment, but CEO Hollub told shareholders and analysts she expects to squeeze $3.5 billion per year in cost savings and capital spending cuts from the deal, and is eager to apply the company\u2019s Permian Basin expertise to Anadarko\u2019s Texas and Colorado oil fields.  \u201cWe will make this work,\u201d Hollub vowed. \u201cWe will get these synergies.\u201d  \u2018AMAZING\u2019 CASH FLOW  Several major oil companies would be willing to buy the Gulf of Mexico offshore assets, or any Permian acreage if Occidental decided to sell some of its long-held properties. It controls about 2.7 million acres there already, split between shale and conventional production, and with the Anadarko deal will acquire an additional 240,000 acres in one of the more productive areas of the Permian Basin.  The Gulf of Mexico business provided nearly a quarter of Anadarko\u2019s oil and gas output while consuming just 19 percent of production spending. Hollub has praised it for its \u201camazing free cash flow,\u201d and M&A analysts say could be worth at least $6 billion.  Potential buyers would be the handful of large companies with deepwater experience, including Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil, Total and Chevron.  Another reason to sell it: Occidental has never operated in the Gulf before. That raises concerns among investors, said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones.  \u201cIt just adds to the risk of a deal. They don\u2019t have that knowledge in house,\u201d she said.  IN THE \u2018DOGHOUSE\u2019 WITH INVESTORS  Another likely candidate for a sale is Western Midstream Partners, Anadarko\u2019s majority-owned gas gathering and pipeline business, valued at around $7.5 billion. Occidental has previously sold off pipelines and coastal terminals. The company\u2019s view of pipeline assets, said finance chief Cedric Burgher to analysts, is \u201cyou don\u2019t need to own\u201d them, only to have the right to use them.  If Hollub can sell the offshore business and close the deal with Total, she could hit a $10 billion to $15 billion divestment target, said Matt Sallee, portfolio manager at investment firm Tortoise Capital Advisors. That could make it less likely that the company would sell any of its onshore or pipeline operations, he said.  \u201cThey would probably really like to get another sale done before the deal closes to remove this risk\u201d of too much debt, said Charles Johnston, analyst at debt research firm CreditSights.  \u201cThe longer they take\u201d to reduce debt from the deal, \u201cthe longer they stay in the doghouse with investors,\u201d said Rowland.  Occidental\u2019s stock fell to a 10-year-low after it reached a merger agreement with Anadarko and analysts at Wells Fargo, KeyBanc Capital Markets and Edward Jones lowered ratings on the company.  Rating firms are forecasting a debt downgrade because of the deal, though none expect Occidental will fall into junk bond status. Moody\u2019s Investors Service said a \u201cweakly positioned investment grade rating\u201d is the most likely for Occidental.  The spread on its 2027 bonds widened a modest 50 basis points since the deal was struck.  \u201cThe company does have a good track record of being able to sell noncore assets at good prices,\u201d said Carol Levenson, director at corporate bond research firm Gimme Credit.  In addition to paying off the deal\u2019s debt, Hollub needs cash to cover dividends due shareholders and Berkshire Hathaway Inc, which negotiated an 8 percent annual payout on a $10 billion investment to help fund the Anadarko deal.  STAYING FOCUSED ON SHALE  What Hollub doesn\u2019t want to sell is the merger\u2019s top prize, Anadarko\u2019s acreage in the top U.S. shale field, the Permian Basin. Anadarko\u2019s properties there are valued at about $18 billion, according to the research firm Drillinginfo.  Anadarko\u2019s Colorado shale operations will likely remain with the Occidental for a lack of ready buyers. New environmental regulations that give communities more control over oil and gas operations have chilled industry investments in the state.  Occidental also would want to hang onto Anadarko\u2019s Colorado shale acreage, said Andrew Dittmar, an M&A analyst with Drillinginfo, because the company is \u201creally good at drilling shale wells.\u201d","122":"Oct 4 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp has put plans to divest part of its ownership in pipeline operator Western Midstream Partners on hold until next year, after failing to attract an offer it deemed attractive, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.  The Houston-based oil and gas exploration and production company inherited Western Midstream earlier this year as part of its $38 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corp, a move which gave it substantial Permian Basin acreage but also assets in areas it had previously exited or had little interest in.  Occidental has moved to offload some of these superfluous positions. It signed an $8.8 billion agreement with Total SA for Anadarko\u2019s African assets in May and held talks in recent weeks with possible buyers, including private equity firms and infrastructure funds, about selling some of Western Midstream.  However, a decline in pipeline stocks since the end of July impacted Western Midstream\u2019s value. Its market value is down nearly 18% since July 30. Occidental was unwilling to sell at a price it deemed too low, according to four sources familiar with the matter.  A spokeswoman for Occidental declined to comment.  Western Midstream is structured as a master limited partnership, a tax-efficient vehicle used by a number of U.S. pipeline firms. Occidental fully owns the general partner stake, which effectively controls Western Midstream, and around 55% of Western Midstream\u2019s limited partner units.  The LP units were trading at $25.21 on Friday, giving Western Midstream a value of around $11.3 billion.  Occidental wanted to so it could retain control of Western Midstream but reduce its holding enough so that it didn\u2019t have to count Western Midstream\u2019s $7.5 billion debt load on Occidental\u2019s books, according to two of the sources.  Some investors, including activist Carl Icahn, raised concerns about how much Occidental was stretching itself financially to buy Anadarko. Occidental hedged around 40% of its 2020 production to safeguard its cash flows and dividend and said it would raise billions from asset sales to pay down debt.  Earlier this week, Occidental said it remains on track to deliver $10 billion to $15 billion of planned asset sales and remains confident in its deleveraging strategy.  As well as Anadarko\u2019s legacy Africa assets, Occidental has sold its stake in Plains All American Pipeline LP for $650 million and signed a partnership with Colombia\u2019s Ecopetrol to develop some Texas acreage worth up to $1.5 billion.

Occidental\u2019s spending on new projects next year will fall to $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion, down from a $9 billion budget this year. In the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, spending will drop by half to $2.2 billion, and by a third in Colorado\u2019s shale fields.  Occidental is battling activist investor Carl Icahn who wants it to accelerate asset sales to pay off debt. Icahn declined comment on Monday.  The Houston-based company reported a third-quarter net loss of $912 million after a year-ago profit of $1.87 billion. The loss included nearly $1.3 billion in pretax acquisition costs and impairment charges.  \u201cWe remain committed to the strategy we laid out to our investors, which focuses on deleveraging and returning excess free cash flow to shareholders,\u201d Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said in a statement.  The company\u2019s shares fell less than 1% in late trading. It is expected to hold a briefing on Tuesday to discuss its results.  Occidental topped its production forecast, delivering 1.16 million barrels of oil and gas. However, its crude sold for $56.26 a barrel on average, down more than $6 a barrel from a year ago.  Profits in its Oxychem chemicals business and midstream and marketing unit both fell sharply. Oxychem pretax income fell 36% to $207 million from the year-ago quarter. Midstream and marketing posted pretax profits of $266 million, down from $1.7 billion a year ago, which was boosted by an asset sale.  Earnings from Occidental\u2019s holdings in pipeline operator Western Midstream Partners was $134 million.  Its operating cash flow of $330 million for the quarter was down from $2.5 billion the year prior. Investors are pressuring oil producers to get their cash flow at least to cover their dividends and capital spending.  Occidental's adjusted earnings fell to $93 million, or 11 cents per share, from $1.36 billion, or $1.77 per share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting earnings of 37 cents a share by the same measure, according to Refinitiv.

Chief Executive Vicki Hollub, who has come under fire for her pursuit of the Anadarko deal, received 91% of shareholder support, up from 78% last year. She received 99.7% in 2018.  An advisory vote on executive compensation was lukewarm, though, with 76% in favor, down from 88% last year and 96% in 2018.  Shareholders approved all Occidental board members by an average of 92%, up from 78.4% last year.  Directors typically receive about 90% favorable votes, with anything around 70% considered a warning from shareholders, said David Larcker, an accounting professor at Stanford University who studies corporate governance.  New directors include Stephen Chazen, a former CEO of Occidental, appointed as board chairman, who received 87.5% support. Three directors affiliated with billionaire activist Carl Icahn received an average of 90% shareholder approval.  Icahn last year launched a proxy fight in opposition to the Anadarko deal.

The midstream segment\u2019s performance was driven by wide differentials between Midland and Gulf Coast crude prices, Raymond James analyst Muhammed Ghulam said.  For the first quarter of 2019, the company forecast pre-tax income of $150 million to $200 million from the unit.  A surge in Permian production had led to trapped barrels in the oilfield, resulting in Midland crude trading at wide discounts to U.S. Gulf Coast prices.  Occidental\u2019s midstream unit, which has benefited from selling discounted Midland crude at higher prices, will likely see lower earnings going forward as the differentials narrow with more pipeline access in the Permian.  A recovery in global oil prices since the end of 2016 led to a resurgence in U.S. shale activity centered around the Permian basin of Texas and New Mexico.

Oxy noted in its presentation that even at a price of $40 per barrel it could maintain its dividend, keep its production level steady and not outspend its cash flow. It also said it would complete a $2 billion share repurchase program this year.  At $50 crude oil, Oxy would maintain its dividend and grow oil and gas production 5 to 8 percent.

The Andarko acquisition closed in August, months before an oil price crash sapped the cash flow Occidental needed to pay the debt taken with the purchase. Critics, including activist shareholder Carl Icahn, have said the financing deal with Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Warren Buffett was too generous.  Occidental and Berkshire Hathaway did not respond to requests for comment.  Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s $10 billion investment provided it with warrants for 80 million common shares in addition to an 8% dividend on preferred shares received for its support for the Anadarko Petroleum acquisition.  Shareholders, who did not get to vote on the Andarko deal last year, will vote at Occidental's May 29 annual meeting to authorize the warrants and to issue 400 million new shares, some of which could pay the Berkshire dividend. tinyurl.com\/ybf9dmtq  Cash-strapped Occidental recently paid Berkshire its first quarter dividend with about 17.3 million shares, which are trading at a fifth of what they fetched last year. When paid in shares, the dividend increases to nearly 9%.  Berkshire\u2019s warrants are nearly worthless, because their $62.50 strike price is well above Occidental\u2019s $13.37 trading price on Friday. But they give Berkshire more than a decade to exercise the option, and dividends paid in shares could make it a major holder in short order.  The Anadarko acquisition was a bet on rising shale oil prices months ahead of the worst price crash in decades. The purchase saddled Occidental with $40 billion in debt and the oil-price crash has cut the value of assets that Occidental picked up in the deal, dashing its hopes of selling them to pay down the debt.

Initially, Occidental had slotted a spending budget of up to $5.4 billion for the year.","136":"HOUSTON, June 7 (Reuters) - Anadarko Petroleum repeatedly spurned rival Occidental Petroleum\u2019s approaches and pushed for all-cash offers, fearing the market\u2019s reaction to the blockbuster $38 billion deal, according to securities filings released on Friday.  Occidental last month beat out Chevron Corp to grab the oil industry\u2019s biggest prize: nearly a quarter million acres in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, where low-cost output has helped turn the United States into the world\u2019s top oil producer at more than 12 million barrels per day.  The rivalry drove up the sale price and guaranteed a huge payday for Anadarko executives, Chevron and deal advisers, the filing showed. Anadarko Chief Executive Al Walker will get $98 million and finance chief Robert Gwin $55 million.  Investment banker Evercore Group, which represented Anadarko, earned a $53 million fee, as did Goldman Sachs & Co, which represented Occidental, the filing showed. Chevron received a $1 billion breakup fee.  Anadarko\u2019s board used the competing offers to press for better terms, according to detailed accounts presented for the first time in the filing. Walker pressed Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub for proof the Occidental board backed her proposals, and she sought a meeting with Anadarko\u2019s lead outside director over Walker\u2019s rejections, according to the account.  The board pushed Occidental to revise an initial, all-stock offer that was not tax-free and to eliminate a needed change to its charter and a shareholder vote. Those efforts prodded Occidental to get financing from billionaire Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc that eliminated a shareholder vote.  The Anadarko board also urged Chevron to increase its initial offer, winning a $1 a share increase to $65 a share, and got Chevron to agree to eliminate a provision requiring its own offer to be presented to Anadarko shareholders if another deal appeared.  Occidental\u2019s Hollub began pursuing Anadarko in July 2017, and that fall presented a stock-swap that valued its rival at $61.22 a share. Walker rejected the offer and she followed up with a deal valuing Anadarko at $76 a share, the filing showed.  The two continued talks through 2018 with the frequency growing after Chevron CEO Michael Wirth approached Anadarko in February offering to buy it for $61 a share in a 25% in cash and 75% stock deal.  Anadarko\u2019s board initially favored Chevron after concluding Occidental\u2019s shares would fall once its offer was publicly announced, and the drop would lower the value of the deal to its shareholders. It pressed Hollub to put a collar on the stock portion. The board also calculated that Occidental would have to sell assets to offset the deal\u2019s debt, adding to the risks it would face.  Occidental\u2019s shares have fallen nearly 28% since its offer for Anadarko became public. It traded down 0.8% at $47.88 on Friday, a more than decade low, while Anadarko shares were up a fraction at $70.24.  Occidental has said it plans to shed most of Anadarko\u2019s non-shale properties and has lined up France\u2019s Total SA to acquire African oil-producing properties for $8.8 billion.  The deal has angered several Occidental investors and prompted activist Carl Icahn to seek seats on its board, calling the deal \u201chugely overpriced.\u201d He also demanded financial records and called on Hollub speed up asset sales. [nL2N236131 He and other investors have criticized the financing agreement with Berkshire Hathaway for an 8% dividend on its $10 billion investment.  The deal has to be approved by Anadarko shareholders, who would receive $59 in cash and a 0.29 share in Occidental for each Anadarko share.  Debt rating firm Moody\u2019s Investors Service estimated that the assumption of Anadarko\u2019s debt and borrowings would add almost $40 billion in debt to Occidental. Moody\u2019s put the company\u2019s debt rating under review for downgrade.

U.S. crude oil output will grow modestly next year, CEO Vicki Hollub said. Oil demand and prices have tumbled this year as a glut of oil hit the market just before the COVID-19 pandemic swept the globe.  Oil demand has rebounded to around 94 million barrels per day (bpd), but will take some time to return to 100 million bpd. The world will get to peak supply before peak demand, she said.  Occidental acquired rival Anadarko Petroleum last year in a $38 billion bet on rising demand and price that left it heavily indebted as consumption tumbled. The company had about $40 billion in debt earlier this year, but on Wednesday, Hollub said the company had reduced its debt by $7 billion.","139":"(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum OXY.N said on Friday it will move to stop investors from amassing more than a 15% stake in a move aimed at activist investor Carl Icahn, who has been buying up shares and stepping up criticism of the oil producer's $38 billion purchase of Anadarko Petroleum last year.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  This week\u2019s slump in oil prices has crystallized the problems facing Occidental, which took on debt to buy Anadarko in a bet that U.S. shale production would keep rising and crude prices would remain high. Earlier this week, Occidental slashed its dividend by 86% and said it would cut spending by 30%.  Occidental said on Friday it will issue a shareholder rights offering, often known as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d because it is designed to discourage takeovers by diluting the ownership interest of a hostile party. Icahn now owns nearly 10% of the company\u2019s stock, he said this week, and has been agitating for changes to Oxy\u2019s board following the Anadarko deal.  Occidental\u2019s dividend cut was its first in 19 years, and the company\u2019s market value is now just over $10 billion, compared with a value of roughly $80 billion when the deal was announced in April of last year. That has given Icahn more ammunition to aim at the board.  \u201cIt\u2019s time for Oxy CEO and board to be held accountable,\u201d Icahn said in an interview with CNBC on Friday.  Icahn bought about 88.6 million shares for $2.21 billion, raising his stake in Occidental to nearly 10% from 2.53% at the end of last year, an SEC filing on Thursday showed. He has repeatedly called upon Occidental to disclose if it had received any takeover offers while looking to buy Anadarko.  The rights offering would issue one right for each share outstanding at the close of March 23, exercisable if a person or group acquires at least 15% of the company\u2019s shares, or if passive institutional investors buy 20% of the oil producer.  The rights plan has to be approved at the 2020 annual meeting, the company said.  Occidental\u2019s market value plunged to $10.6 billion as of Thursday\u2019s close, less than a third of what it paid for Anadarko and its debt has ballooned to about $40 billion.  U.S. crude fell to roughly $32 a barrel on Friday, down about 20% on the week as the coronavirus outbreak threatened demand and crude producers promised more supply.

Icahn is calling on the board to set a record date to determine which shareholders could petition to hold a special meeting.  Icahn, one of industry\u2019s most powerful activist investors, cast himself as one of the deal\u2019s most fervent critics by charging that Occidental\u2019s bid for Anadarko was too expensive and could endanger Occidental\u2019s future if oil prices sink.  Icahn, who owns a $1.6 billion stake in Occidental as of May 30, had sued Occidental in a Delaware court.

Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is seen in The Woodlands, Texas, U.S., April 30, 2019.

Anadarko\u2019s shareholders voted 99% in favor of the deal that gives them $72.34 per share based on Wednesday\u2019s closing price for Occidental. Investors also voted in a non=binding measure 71% against executive payouts tied to the deal. Anadarko\u2019s top six executives are to receive $300 million in payouts.  Occidental said immediately after the vote it had closed the transaction, and had named new executives to run Western Midstream Partners LP WES.N, Anadarko's natural gas pipeline business. Its shares rose 2.5% to close at $47.13.  \u201cWe begin our work to integrate our two companies and unlock the significant value of this combination for shareholders,\u201d Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said in a statement.  Anadarko shares are up 56% from the day before it disclosed merger talks, while Occidental shares are down 30% since its discussions were revealed.  The market\u2019s sour response has dampened enthusiasm for deals. Even with stocks of many shale firms trading at multi-year lows, it may not be enough to spur a buyout spree by the world\u2019s largest oil and gas firms, said Artem Abramov, analyst with Rystad Energy.  \u201cSome super-majors might be waiting for even lower pricing,\u201d Abramov said.  Hollub has been lining up financing and organizing asset sales to fund the deal while battling activist investor Carl Icahn, who wants to replace four Occidental directors and influence the pace of the company\u2019s asset sales.  Hollub avoided her own shareholder vote on the deal by securing a controversial and pricey $10 billion financing agreement with Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway BRKa.N. Icahn likened the deal to \"taking candy from a baby\" on Buffett's part.  Occidental this week sold $13 billion in bonds to help fund the Anadarko purchase and has proposed selling Anadarko\u2019s Africa assets to Total SA TOTF.PA.  It also formed a drilling partnership with Colombia\u2019s state-run oil company Ecopetrol SA ECO.CN to develop part of its Permian shale field for up to $1.5 billion.  Occidental last week reported a 14% drop in second quarter profit, as costs related to the deal and weaker chemical earnings hit its bottom line.","143":"HOUSTON, May 10 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Chief Executive Vicki Hollub takes her case for buying Anadarko Petroleum to the company\u2019s shareholders on Friday, bolstered by rapid deal-making that put her on the cusp of victory.  Hollub, 59, challenged larger rival Chevron Corp with a long-shot bid that some of her own investors say is risky because it saddles Occidental with about $46 billion in new debt. By deftly lining up allies and cash, she put together a strategy that on Thursday prompted Chevron to withdraw.  The annual meeting will be the first chance for Occidental shareholders to present their views to managers, even if they do not get a say on the deal. The lack of a deal vote and the stock\u2019s drop to $56.33 a 10-year low on Thursday could lead to a messy victory party.  Several big holders have criticized Hollub\u2019s decision to secure Anadarko by increasing the cash portion of the $76-per-share offer to a point where a shareholder vote is no longer needed.  But unless another suitor appears, the $38 billion, mostly cash deal would cement its status as the largest oil producer in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field. Occidental\u2019s global production would double to 1.4 million barrels of oil and gas per day.  Hollub has promised to quickly shed most of Anadarko\u2019s non-U.S. oil properties to focus on shale. It also must absorb or sell Anadarko\u2019s U.S. Gulf of Mexico offshore production.  With Anadarko\u2019s nearly quarter-million acres in the Permian Basin, Occidental would command 1.64 million acres of prime land in the Permian and gain access to growing shale fields in Colorado and Wyoming.  The deal\u2019s financial and operating risks have soured some big Occidental holders, including T. Rowe Price and Matrix Asset Management.  \u201cOn paper, at $65-per-barrel oil, the deal could be executed well. That sort of is turning a blind eye to the fact that they\u2019re in a cyclical industry,\u201d said David Katz, president of Matrix.  Rating firm Moody\u2019s Investors Service said Wednesday it likely would downgrade Occidental if it prevails due to the added debt that will make it harder for the company to confront a downturn in oil prices.  \u201cIf you do this you have a strained balance sheet, period,\u201d said Christian Ledoux, investment chief at Occidental shareholder South Texas Money Management.  T. Rowe Price, which holds about 21.1 million Occidental shares, said it will withhold votes for Occidental directors due to the lack of a shareholder vote on the deal.  Hollub, who has sought to buy Anadarko for two years, proved her ability to sweep away hurdles by quickly pulling in powerful allies. She convinced Berkshire Hathaway Inc\u2019s Warren Buffett to invest $10 billion in Occidental stock to help close the deal.  France\u2019s Total SA separately agreed to buy all of Anadarko\u2019s oil-and-gas producing assets outside the United States, including its biggest future expense, a multi-billion dollar liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique, for $8.8 billion.","144":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum chief executive Vicki Hollub was caught off guard when U.S. oil giant Chevron swooped in last month with a $33 billion offer to buy Anadarko Petroleum, the oil and gas exploration and production firm she had been wooing for nearly two years.  Chevron, nearly five times larger than Occidental, appeared to have out-maneuvered its smaller rival. But on Sunday Hollub showed the fight was not over. After a whirlwind few days to raise more cash, Hollub offered a sweetened deal. By Thursday, Chevron had bowed out.  In edging out Chevron, Hollub leaned on global relationships and knowledge forged from 35 years in the oil industry, according to about a dozen people familiar with the talks leading up to the company\u2019s latest offer.  Occidental had struggled to win over Anadarko because its first public $38 billion offer of 50 percent cash and 50 percent stock, as well as previous offers made privately, required the approval of Occidental shareholders, and Anadarko was not convinced they would go for the deal, two sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters.  Hollub knew she needed to substantially increase the cash offer - thereby making shareholder approval unnecessary - and moved swiftly to secure it, the sources said.  She was in Paris on April 26, just two weeks after Chevron\u2019s announcement, and struck an $8.8 billion deal with French major Total SA to sell Anadarko assets her company didn\u2019t yet own.  Two days later she was in Omaha, Nebraska, securing $10 billion in financing from billionaire investor Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, who typically does not partner with companies pursuing unsolicited takeovers.  Occidental declined to make Hollub available for an interview for this story. The company\u2019s shares are down 9 percent since making their offer public in late April.  The combined company would establish Occidental as the largest operator in the Permian basin in west Texas and New Mexico, the heart of the U.S. shale revolution, where a boom in production has propelled the United States into becoming the world\u2019s largest oil producer.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  It would make Occidental the third-largest U.S. oil company with a market value of about $80 billion, dwarfed only by global giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron.  \u201cShe\u2019s doing the boldest M&A thing that\u2019s happened since the \u201880s,\u201d said Amy Myers Jaffe, energy consultant and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cYou\u2019re having an atypical M&A battle in a very competitive space where (usually) the bigger you are, the more you\u2019re going to win.\u201d  Hollub\u2019s challenge has stunned an industry where the last attempt to break up an agreed-upon deal between two U.S. oil companies was in 1984 when Texaco challenged Pennzoil\u2019s acquisition of Getty Oil.  It has also angered some Occidental investors who say Hollub is overstretching the company\u2019s balance sheet in an ill-advised quest for size in a volatile industry.  \u201cOur concern is the willingness of the management team at Occidental to cut very favorable deals against the interests of shareholders on a longer-term basis,\u201d said John Linehan, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price.  T. Rowe, the sixth-largest holder of Occidental shares, announced it would vote against the board of directors on the annual shareholder meeting Friday. But such a move may be mostly symbolic.  An Occidental spokesman declined to comment on the concerns but pointed to Hollub\u2019s defense of her strategy that it was better to raise cash than issue new debt.  Hollub\u2019s background in the technical aspects of oil production contrasts with her predecessor, a banker and known dealmaker. She has been described as down to earth by former and current employees, differing from flamboyant energy CEOs.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  LONGTIME DISCUSSIONS  Buying Anadarko was seen as the best way for Occidental to gain more acreage in the Permian shale basin, where it markets nearly a quarter of all barrels produced in the region.  When Chevron announced a deal on April 12 to buy Anadarko, Hollub gathered the merger team. They were shocked that Anadarko had accepted a bid that was $11 per share below what Occidental had privately offered, three of the people familiar with the discussions said.  \u201cShe thought, we\u2019re in it to win it. Let\u2019s make our offer public so their shareholders know what they passed up,\u201d one of the sources said.  In a letter to Anadarko\u2019s board of directors on April 24, Occidental said they \u201cwere surprised and disappointed\u201d that Anadarko had not agreed to their previous two offers in April.  Anadarko executives, however, remained concerned that Occidental shareholders could scuttle the deal, leaving them without a buyer, two sources familiar with the situation said. The board of directors wanted to stick with Chevron.  Just two days after sending the letter, Hollub was in Paris meeting with Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne to discuss Anadarko\u2019s African assets, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.  The two already had a relationship stemming from the Dolphin Gas Project, a Middle East cross-border gas initiative where both companies have an equal share. Total had made it known to her that they coveted Anadarko\u2019s properties, including a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique.  \u201cVicki wanted to show that she could quickly put the cash on the table. In less than 10 days she had the cash ready,\u201d a Paris-based source said.  Omaha, Nebraska was next. Buffett is known for moving quickly when a deal piques his interest, but he tends to avoid getting involved in hostile takeover bids.  The meeting was set up by BofA CEO Brian Moynihan, whose bank was helping to provide financing for the Anadarko deal. Hollub later said Buffett was \u201cwarm and wonderful\u201d in their meeting, a source familiar with the discussions said.  Buffett, cash flush and on the hunt for new deals, agreed to provide $10 billion in financing in return for an 8 percent premium, a concern for dividend-focused shareholders who believe the terms are too pricey.  The two deals enabled Hollub to submit a revised offer on Sunday, increasing the cash component from 50 percent to 78 percent.  On Thursday, Chevron said it would collect its $1 billion termination fee and walk away from the negotiations.

The preferred stock carries an 8% annual dividend. Occidental exercised its option to pay Berkshire\u2019s two prior quarterly dividends in common stock. Berkshire disclosed last month it sold the stock comprising the first of these payouts.  Occidental \u201chas the ability to generate substantial free cash at current oil prices\u201d to service near-term debts, Morningstar analyst David Meats said in an email. \u201cAs a result there\u2019s no need to pay the preferred in stock, and the decision to do so earlier was probably due to abundance of caution at the outset of the pandemic and associated oil downturn.\u201d  Since March, Occidental has lowered capital spending, slashed its common stock dividend 98.7%, and pursued asset sales to conserve cash and reduce debt from the Anadarko purchase.

Critics, including activist shareholder Carl Icahn, have said the financing deal with Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Warren Buffett was too generous.  Occidental and Berkshire Hathaway declined to comment.  Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s $10 billion investment provided it with warrants for 80 million common shares in addition to an 8% dividend on preferred shares received for its support for the Anadarko Petroleum acquisition.  Shareholders, who did not get to vote on the Anadarko deal last year, will vote at Occidental's May 29 annual meeting to authorize the warrants and to issue 400 million new shares, some of which could pay the Berkshire dividend. tinyurl.com\/ybf9dmtq  Shareholders could voice disapproval of the Anadarko deal by not voting in favor of the proposals, said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones. But Occidental needs the high number of authorized shares to pay the preferred dividend and some employee compensation, \u201cas they need to preserve as much cash as possible,\u201d Rowland added.  Cash-strapped Occidental recently paid Berkshire its first quarter dividend with about 17.3 million shares, which are trading at a fifth of what they fetched last year. When paid in shares, the dividend increases to nearly 9%.  Berkshire\u2019s warrants are nearly worthless, because their $62.50 strike price is well above Occidental\u2019s $13.63 closing price on Friday. But they give Berkshire more than a decade to exercise the option, and dividends paid in shares could make it a major holder in short order.  The Anadarko acquisition was a bet on rising shale oil prices months ahead of the worst price crash in decades. The purchase saddled Occidental with $40 billion in debt and the oil-price crash has cut the value of assets that Occidental picked up in the deal, dashing its hopes of selling them to pay down the debt. U.S. oil prices have fallen below $20 per barrel from $61 at the start of the year.  Chief Executive Vicki Hollub\u2019s base pay for 2020 was cut 81%, according to a Friday filing, as the board capped the salaries of named officers at $250,000. Her base salary in 2019 was $1.33 million.  Hollub had $4.4 million in realized compensation last year, as the value of stock awards - worth $10.5 million during 2019 - tumbled with the company\u2019s share price.

U.S. oil producers were helped in the fourth quarter by rising crude prices and increasing global demand, fueling strong expectations for earnings, though several have fallen short. Like Occidental, Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp also failed to beat Wall Street\u2019s quarterly expectations.  Occidental posted fourth-quarter net income of $497 million, or 65 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $272 million, or 36 cents, in the year-ago period.  Excluding one-time items, the company earned 41 cents per share, matching analyst\u2019s expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Production rose about 7 percent to 621,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe\/d). For 2018, Oxy said it plans to spend $3.9 billion, about 7 percent higher from 2017 levels. Production should rise this year 8 percent to 12 percent, Occidental forecast.  Much of the production increase should come in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield. Oxy, one of the largest acreage holders in the Permian, expects to pump 169,000 to 173,000 boe\/d in its shale operations there during the first quarter.  \u201cWe remain committed to value-based production growth as we execute our returns-focused capital program in 2018,\u201d Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said in a statement.

Occidental posted a $2.2-billion first-quarter loss from write downs and the about 45% collapse in oil prices this year amid the COVID-19 pandemic. It may need to swap shares for debt to reduce the cost of financing the deal, an ill-timed bet on rising shale oil production and prices.  The company has slashed its dividend by 86% and spending nearly in half, and asked employees to bid for job buyouts. This week, Anadarko investors sued Occidental, alleging it concealed its inability to weather collapsing oil prices.  Occidental has been paying dividends to Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway in shares in lieu of cash, a move to help relieve strain on its balance sheet.  Shareholders authorized the company to issue 400 million shares in part to give it a means of continuing to pay preferred dividends in stock, and potentially to swap shares for its debt.  Last year, Berkshire helped finance the Anadarko deal by buying $10 billion in preferred shares. Friday\u2019s vote also authorized the issue to Berkshire of warrants for up 80 million common shares.

Oil prices have plunged more than 40% this year, straddling Occidental with a debt pile of about $40 billion from the Anadarko deal.

Occidental bet heavily on the continued growth in U.S. shale oil, taking on heavy debts for its controversial purchase of Anadarko Petroleum last year for $38 billion. That bet has proved ill-timed following the coronavirus outbreak, which has cut fuel demand worldwide by about 30% and is responsible for the worst oil-and-gas-industry downturn in 40 years.  Energy companies worldwide, including Exxon Mobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, have slashed capital expenditures and oil output to reckon with the pandemic.  Houston-based Occidental last week posted a $2 billion quarterly loss and has slashed capital spending drastically to shore up its balance sheet. The company said that if spending cuts are not met, it will have \u201cserious potential consequences\u201d to the company, the document said.  Interested employees can submit a resignation offer to Occidental through May 26, specifying the number of months of base salary that they will accept for voluntary separation, according to the document. Employees can amend or withdraw offers unless the company has already accepted them by then, the document said. Offers not accepted will expire automatically on June 12.  Occidental declined to comment.  The company\u2019s shares are down 64% on the year, making it one of the worst-performing stocks in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index.  Occidental has been cutting expenses to deal with its debt-laden balance sheet and had been laying off workers and selling assets to pare down debt even before the fall in oil prices.  The company said last week it is considering raising new cash, swapping debt for stock or refinancing existing debt due to shrinking oil demand. It withdrew its outlook for 2020.  It cut its 2020 capex budget on three separate occasions this year, most recently to $2.5 billion from an original plan of $5.3 billion.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  (Reuters) - Anadarko Petroleum Corp APC.N, in its last earnings report before shareholders vote on its sale to Occidental Petroleum OXY.N, on Friday reported a quarterly profit that topped analysts' estimates, as higher production offset lower prices for its oil.  It reported a net loss on a $1 billion breakup fee paid to Chevron Corp CVX.N. Anadarko accepted a $38 billion offer from Occidental after having initially agreed to a deal with Chevron. The deal would make Occidental the largest oil producer in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field.  Anadarko\u2019s second-quarter average daily production rose nearly 17% to 744,000 barrels of oil and gas, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of 719,130, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Average oil prices fell 8.7% in the quarter, while gas prices dropped 10.2% and natural gas liquids prices tumbled 41%, Anadarko said. It received an average $66.03 per barrel for its oil compared with $68.43 a year earlier.  Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who owns a 4.4% stake in Occidental, has launched a proxy fight seeking four seats on Occidental\u2019s board, arguing that directors overpaid for Anadarko and failed to give shareholders a say in the proposed deal. Icahn aims to influence the pace and scale of Occidental\u2019s post-deal asset sales.  Occidental has attacked Icahn\u2019s slate of board nominees as inadequate for the job.  Anadarko\u2019s net loss was $1.03 billion, or $2.09 per share, in the latest quarter ended June 30, including the breakup fee, a loss on derivatives and merger-related costs. Its shareholders are scheduled to vote on the deal on Aug. 8.  Anadarko, which has operations in the United States, South America and Africa, said adjusted net income fell 10% to $249 million, or 51 cents per share. It earned $278 million, or 54 cents a share, on the same basis a year-earlier quarter.

It characterized the transaction as \u201ccostless\u201d but a Reuters review of regulatory filings, market data and interviews shows that\u2019s not the whole story.  FILE PHOTO: The logo for Occidental Petroleum is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The aim of the complex financial maneuver, the company said, was to help preserve Occidental\u2019s generous dividend to shareholders as it sought to take over rival Anadarko Petroleum for $38 billion last summer in the biggest industry deal for years.  \u201cWith the additional leverage from the Anadarko acquisition, these new hedges will strengthen our 2020 cash flow in a low oil price environment, and provide additional assurance that our dividend is safe, while we are deleveraging,\u201d Occidental\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Cedric Burgher told an earnings call in August.  However, to secure the hedge swiftly and discreetly and to avoid paying its bankers a fee for arranging it, the company took a bigger potential hit to future revenues with only limited protection against falling oil prices, according to a source with direct knowledge of the transaction.  While Occidental disclosed the financial details of the hedge in filings, fulfilling its regulatory obligations, the fact that the company took on the additional risk to secure the transaction fast and to avoid banker fees has not been previously reported.  Occidental declined to comment for this story.  Hedges are used by a variety of companies. Airlines use them to protect against rising fuel prices and energy producers use them to lock in revenue, usually by buying a put option, a type of derivative contract, which gives them the right to sell oil at a predetermined future price.  Occidental used a complex series of transactions for its hedge, which was arranged by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup, according to six sources with direct knowledge of the trades. The summer hedge covered nearly 110 million barrels of oil, or 300,000 barrels a day, each for 2020 and 2021, nearly enough to meet the annual oil imports of Australia.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup declined to comment.  For a graphic on how the hedge was executed, click on [tmsnrt.rs\/35L1B3p].  The hedge meant the firm could sell the oil at a minimum of $55 a barrel in 2020, even if crude prices fell below that, to a limit of $45 a barrel; but the company\u2019s selling price was capped at $74.09, and it would lose out on any revenue earned from oil prices rising beyond that mark.  Occidental capped revenues for 2020 and also 2021 but only got downside protection for 2020 - a lopsided deal sometimes referred to as a naked hedge. Limiting future revenue without getting a guarantee against falling prices is unusual in the energy sector.  While Occidental has disclosed the details of the 2020 hedge in regulatory filings, the absence of a hedge against falling oil prices in 2021 was not explicitly mentioned. The company said the 2021 options were meant to increase the maximum selling price it would receive for 2020 sales.  \u201cOccidental entered into the 2021 call options to substantially improve the ceiling price that the Company will receive for the contracted commodity volumes in 2020,\u201d it said in a filing.  Some analysts said investors should have been given more information about the potential implications of the hedge.  \u201cIt seems very strange that they left a naked hedge in 2021 which capped upside but offered no downside protection,\u201d said David Katz, president and CIO of Matrix Asset Advisors, which owns 0.3% of Occidental\u2019s shares.  However, other analysts said Occidental needed to secure a hedge quickly to defuse some of the pressure from investors.  \u201cDoing this gives Oxy a lot of flexibility in 2020 with cash flow,\u201d said Trisha Curtis, President of PetroNerds, an energy analytics and advisory firm specializing in U.S. shale.  \u201cYou can\u2019t have an acquisition that big and then willy-nilly hope that oil prices hold up. Regardless of what it cost them, it was needed for a number of reasons.\u201d  (GRAPHIC: Breaking down Occidental's hedge - )  REVENUE-LIMITING OPTIONS  Occidental has said publicly that it does not regularly hedge its oil sales because it does not want to give up potential revenue. The last time the company hedged was in 2005, also following an acquisition.  In the summer of 2019, Occidental was under pressure to demonstrate that its dividend was being protected.  Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn was campaigning against the Anadarko deal and Anadarko itself had issued a regulatory filing on July 29 saying its calculations showed that Occidental, even without an acquisition, would not be able to generate enough cash to pay its dividend for the next three years.  Occidental executives wanted to be able to announce the hedge to reassure investors when they presented second-quarter results on July 31, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the transaction.  Bank of America and Citigroup had been advising Occidental on the Anadarko acquisition. Now their traders had about two weeks to complete the hedge.  Acting on Occidental\u2019s behalf, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup sold two types of derivative contracts, with the intention of using the proceeds from the sales to fund the purchase of a put option locking in Occidental\u2019s oil revenues at $55 a barrel for 2020, according to the six sources.  In illiquid private markets, big transactions are more difficult, and therefore more expensive, to execute. If rival traders get wind of a deal before it is fully executed, they could get in first with their own buy or sell orders, pushing up or down the target price.  In the case of Occidental\u2019s hedge, the large volume of oil and the tight time frame to insure it meant the banks were not going to be able to raise enough money from selling derivative contracts for 2020 alone to cover the cost of the hedge, the first source said.  To fill the gap and avoid having to present Occidental with a large bill, the banks sold similar revenue-limiting options for 2021, the source said.  Selling the 2021 options also increased the amount of money the banks could make because they were selling additional contracts on Occidental\u2019s behalf.  Derivatives trades require only minimal disclosure and it is unclear how much of a profit the banks made from the Occidental deal.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup declined to comment.  In the first week of 2020, international oil prices spiked by around 9% to nearly $72 a barrel due to heightened tensions in the Middle East. They have since fallen back to around $65, $2 above the price they are expected to average out at over 2020, according to the most recent Reuters poll.  If those expectations pan out, Occidental will not miss out on potential profits, so the bet would work out. On the other hand, if oil prices were to surge again, and remain above $74 a barrel, the cost to Occidental could translate to millions of dollars a month in lost revenues, even at just $1 above the price cap.  Despite the hedge underpinning its dividend, Occidental shares have fallen by nearly a third since April, when its interest in Anadarko first became public.","162":"July 6 (Reuters) - The state of Wyoming will bid on a package of land and minerals in Wyoming and Colorado owned by troubled Occidental Petroleum Corporation, public officials voted on Monday.

Anadarko\u2019s board used the suitors\u2019 competing offers to press for better terms, according to detailed accounts presented for the first time in the filing.  The board pushed Occidental to revise an initial, all-stock offer that was not tax-free, needed a shareholder vote and required a change to its charter. Those efforts prodded Occidental to obtain financing from billionaire Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc that eliminated a shareholder vote.  In addition, the Anadarko board urged Chevron to increase its initial offer, winning a $1 a share increase to $65 a share, and got Chevron to agree to eliminate a provision requiring its own offer to be presented to Anadarko shareholders if another deal appeared.  Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub began pursuing Anadarko in July 2017, and that fall presented a stock-swap that valued its rival at $61.22 a share. Walker rejected the offer and she followed up with a deal valuing Anadarko at $76 a share, the filing showed.  The two continued talks through 2018 with the frequency growing after Chevron CEO Michael Wirth approached Anadarko in February offering to buy it for $64 a share in a deal that was 25 percent cash and 75 percent stock.  Anadarko\u2019s board initially favored Chevron after concluding Occidental\u2019s shares would fall once its offer was publicly announced, and the drop would lower the value of the deal to Anadarko\u2019s shareholders. It pressed Hollub to put a collar on the stock portion. The board also calculated that Occidental would have to sell assets to pay down debt, adding to the risks it would face.  Anadarko\u2019s board believed that if it accepted Occidental\u2019s bid first, Chevron would walk away, but if it accepted the Chevron deal, \u201cthere was a substantial likelihood that Occidental would continue its pursuit\u201d and \u201cAnadarko\u2019s stockholders would benefit significantly.\u201d  Occidental, Anadarko and Chevron did not respond to requests for further comment.  Occidental\u2019s shares have fallen nearly 28% since its offer for Anadarko became public. It traded on Friday down 0.9% at $47.84, a more than decade low, while Anadarko shares were down a fraction at $70.05. Chevron\u2019s stock traded at $121.48 on Friday, about even with where it traded when it walked away from the deal.  Occidental has said it plans to shed most of Anadarko\u2019s non-shale properties and has lined up France\u2019s Total SA to acquire African oil-producing properties for $8.8 billion.  The deal has angered several Occidental investors and prompted activist Carl Icahn to seek seats on its board, calling the transaction \u201chugely overpriced.\u201d He also demanded financial records and called on Hollub speed up asset sales.  He and other investors have criticized the financing agreement with Berkshire Hathaway for an 8% dividend on its $10 billion investment.  The deal has to be approved by Anadarko shareholders, who would receive $59 in cash and a 0.29 share in Occidental for each Anadarko share.  Credit rating firm Moody\u2019s Investors Service estimated that the assumption of Anadarko\u2019s debt and borrowings would add almost $40 billion in debt to Occidental. Moody\u2019s put the company\u2019s debt rating under review for downgrade.

Icahn, who owns $1.6 billion worth of Occidental shares, accused the board of being \u201cfar over their heads,\u201d saying they \u201cmade numerous blunders in recent months and might continue to trip over their feet if the board is not strengthened,\u201d the lawsuit said. He also criticized Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub and her management team for taking $100 million in pay since 2016.  Occidental said it would respond to the lawsuit and expects to complete the merger this year. Its bid for Anadarko topped one by Chevron Corp and includes a $10 billion financing deal with Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  \u201cOccidental is committed to maximizing long-term value for all shareholders, and our board and management team continually evaluate opportunities to that end,\u201d the company said.  Icahn\u2019s lawsuit, filed in Delaware Court of Chancery, seeks documents that detail Occidental\u2019s sale of preferred stock to Berkshire, which he described as a \u201cdesperate\u201d move, and information on a deal to sell Anadarko\u2019s Africa assets to Total SA for $8.8 billion.  The merger of the two U.S. shale producers would increase Occidental\u2019s debt to around $40 billion, assuming it sells the Africa assets to Total.  Icahn may seek to call a special meeting of shareholders to remove and replace directors, the suit said, and believes Occidental should have been a seller rather than a buyer.  \u201cThat would have been the stockholder-friendly thing to do,\u201d the suit said. It also ask for details on whether other companies have inquired about buying all or part of Occidental.  The Berkshire investment allowed Occidental to increase the cash portion of its bid for Anadarko and eliminated the need for Occidental to win approval from its own shareholders.  The acquisition is \u201clittle more than an enormous bet on the price of oil,\u201d the lawsuit said, adding that \u201cif management\u2019s dreams of glory require placing the stockholders\u2019 dividends at risk, the stockholders really ought to be asked whether they agree.\u201d  Icahn was not the only investor to take issue with the lack of a shareholder vote on the deal.  T. Rowe Price Group Inc said it would vote against the Occidental board of directors at the company\u2019s annual meeting earlier this month because the company would not allow shareholders to vote on its bid for Anadarko, which T. Rowe Price and other shareholders opposed.  Occidental shares closed down a fraction at $51.91 on Thursday, near a 10-year low.

Shares fell to $14.23 after the company laid out in a securities filing the potential for new asset impairments and an ownership change based on its need to raise new cash to cover future debt payments.  Wednesday\u2019s drop pushed its shares down about 65% this year.  Robert Peterson, the company\u2019s finance chief, said in a conference call on Wednesday it is considering raising new cash, swapping debt for stock and refinancing existing debt because of collapsing oil demand. Occidental also withdrew its 2020 outlook.  Future debt-for-stock swaps or use of stock to pay preferred dividends could cause an ownership change under Internal Revenue Service rules, it said in a securities filing.  The company is struggling with debt taken on in last year\u2019s $38 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum, an ill-timed bet on rising shale oil prices ahead of a market dive that continues to weigh on its results.  Global energy demand has tumbled amid coronavirus-related travel and business restrictions and a glut of oil from a price war.  The value of about $44 billion in acquired oil and gas properties may be reduced due to the decline in oil prices, it also said in a securities filing. They include Anadarko properties acquired when U.S. oil, now selling for about $23 a barrel, sold for $51, it said in the filing.  Occidental hired investment bankers Moelis & Co to advise on its debt, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. While the bulk of that debt comes due beginning next year, it could face a $992 million call in October from noteholders, according to Wednesday\u2019s securities filing.  The company is \u201cincreasingly challenged to manage its significant debt burden\u201d and production likely will drop more than 10% by year end, said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones.  The planned sale of its Algerian oil and gas properties to France\u2019s Total SA will not go forward, both companies said this week. Occidental will have to reclassify those as continuing operations, which could hurt second-quarter results, Rowland said.  The Anadarko purchase increased Occidental\u2019s debt to about $40 billion, and the oil-price crash has cut the value of assets picked up in the deal, making it harder to sell some of them to pay down the debt.","171":"FILE PHOTO: Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is seen in The Woodlands, Texas, U.S., April 30, 2019.

Activist investor Carl Icahn this month launched a campaign to unseat four Occidental directors, arguing its board entered into the $38 billion deal to preclude Occidental from becoming a takeover target. He has attacked the deal as too pricy and for the lack of an Occidental shareholder vote.  Anadarko said in a regulatory filing it amended its merger proxy in response to a lawsuit alleging it had failed to provide its shareholders with full details of the cash-and-stock sale. Its shareholders are due to vote on the sale Aug. 8.  An Anadarko spokesman did not immediately reply to requests for comment.  The revisions include projections that the filing said was provided by Occidental\u2019s management and adjusted by Anadarko\u2019s executives showing the standalone company\u2019s free cash flow would fall below dividend payments in each of the next three years. The shortfall increased each year through 2021, according to the proxy revision.  Companies that do not generate enough free cash flow to cover expenses such as dividends typically have to borrow or sell assets to cover the shortfall.  The new details also include an $8.4 billion estimate of the value of Anadarko's share in Western Gas Partners LP WES.N, a publicly-traded natural gas processing, storage and pipeline company. That stake is expected to be offered for sale after the combination takes place.","172":"(Adds conference call details, updates shares)  Aug 9 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp, the largest oil and gas producer in the Permian basin, on Thursday said it was raising its capital spending sharply but it maintained a tepid production forecast for the year, causing investors to send its shares down as much 6.3 percent.  Producers are under pressure from investors to increase production while reining in expenses. In March, investors punished the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, Exxon Mobil, after it outlined plans to double annual earnings by 2025 through heavier investments here.  Houston-based Occidental, which was the biggest drag Thursday on the S&P Energy Index and earlier the second biggest on the broader S&P 500 index, boosted its spending target to $5 billion from $3.9 billion, a 28 percent increase that surprised some analysts.  On an earnings call on Thursday, Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said the company\u2019s outlays might go higher next year, to between $5 billion to $5.3 billion if oil prices, now about $67 a barrel, held above $60.  \u201cWe were a bit under capital versus our peers,\u201d Hollub said in response to a question about the magnitude of the budget increase.  Occidental lowered the top end of its production guidance while boosting the lower end. Occidental now expects annual output of 650,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 664,000 boe\/d, compared with its earlier guidance of 645,000 boe\/d to 665,000 boe\/d.  The company also said on its conference call that it raised annual guidance for production in the Permian by 3 percent, where it plans to spend most of the increased capex.  \u201cThe disproportionate raise of 2018 capex relative to production guidance are going to be a hurdle for the stock near term,\u201d Jefferies analyst Jason Gammel said.  Chief Financial Officer Cedric Burgher said the company expects increased Permian production due to improved well productivity and an increase in well count.  The production gains and a sale of pipeline and oil-export assets will add about $5 billion to the company\u2019s 2018 cash flow, he said, helping finance share repurchases and strengthening its balance sheet.  Occidental had said in March that it expected its Permian shale division to break even - or generate as much cash as it spends - by the third quarter..

(Reporting by Ernest Scheyder, editing by G Crosse)","181":"NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum chief executive Vicki Hollub was caught off guard when U.S. oil giant Chevron swooped in last month with a $33 billion offer to buy Anadarko Petroleum, the oil and gas exploration and production firm she had been wooing for nearly two years. Chevron, nearly five times larger than Occidental , appeared to have out-maneuvered its smaller rival. But on Sunday Hollub showed the fight was not over. After a whirlwind few days to raise more cash, Hollub offered a sweetened deal. By Thursday, Chevron had bowed out.  In edging out Chevron in the bidding war, Hollub leaned on global relationships and knowledge forged from 35 years in the oil industry, according to about a dozen people familiar with the talks leading up to the company\u2019s latest offer.  Occidental had struggled to win over Anadarko because its first public $38 billion offer of 50 percent cash and 50 percent stock, as well as previous offers made privately, required the approval of Occidental shareholders, and Anadarko was not convinced they would go for the deal, two sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters.  Hollub knew she needed to substantially increase the cash offer - thereby making shareholder approval unnecessary - and moved swiftly to secure it, the sources said.  She was in Paris on April 26, just two weeks after Chevron\u2019s announcement, and struck an $8.8 billion deal with French major Total SA to sell Anadarko assets her company didn\u2019t yet own.  Two days later she was in Omaha, Nebraska, securing $10 billion in financing from billionaire investor Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, who typically does not partner with companies pursuing unsolicited takeovers.  Occidental declined to make Hollub available for an interview for this story.  The combined company would establish Occidental as the largest operator in the Permian basin in west Texas and New Mexico, the heart of the U.S. shale revolution, where a boom in production has propelled the United States into becoming the world\u2019s largest oil producer.  It would make Occidental the third-largest U.S. oil company with a market value of about $80 billion, dwarfed only by global giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron.  \u201cShe\u2019s doing the boldest M&A thing that\u2019s happened since the \u201880s,\u201d said Amy Myers Jaffe, energy consultant and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cYou\u2019re having an atypical M&A battle in a very competitive space where (usually) the bigger you are, the more you\u2019re going to win.\u201d  Hollub\u2019s challenge has stunned an industry where the last attempt to break up an agreed-upon deal between two U.S. oil companies was in 1984 when Texaco challenged Pennzoil\u2019s acquisition of Getty Oil.  It has also angered some Occidental investors who say Hollub is overstretching the company\u2019s balance sheet in an ill-advised quest for size in a volatile industry.  \u201cOur concern is the willingness of the management team at Occidental to cut very favorable deals against the interests of shareholders on a longer-term basis,\u201d said John Linehan, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price.  T. Rowe, the sixth-largest holder of Occidental shares, announced it would vote against the board of directors on the annual shareholder meeting Friday. But such a move may be mostly symbolic.  An Occidental spokesman declined to comment on the concerns but pointed to Hollub\u2019s defense of her strategy that it was better to raise cash than issue new debt.  Hollub\u2019s background in the technical aspects of oil production contrasts with her predecessor, a banker and known dealmaker. She has been described as down to earth by former and current employees, differing from flamboyant energy CEOs.  LONGTIME DISCUSSIONS  Buying Anadarko was seen as the best way for Occidental to gain more acreage in the Permian shale basin, where it markets nearly a quarter of all barrels produced in the region.  When Chevron announced a deal on April 12 to buy Anadarko, Hollub gathered the merger team. They were shocked that Anadarko had accepted a bid that was $11 per share below what Occidental had privately offered, three of the people familiar with the discussions said.  \u201cShe thought, we\u2019re in it to win it. Let\u2019s make our offer public so their shareholders know what they passed up,\u201d one of the sources said.  In a letter to Anadarko\u2019s board of directors on April 24, Occidental said they \u201cwere surprised and disappointed\u201d that Anadarko had not agreed to their previous two offers in April.  Anadarko executives, however, remained concerned that Occidental shareholders could scuttle the deal, leaving them without a buyer, two sources familiar with the situation said. The board of directors wanted to stick with Chevron.  Just two days after sending the letter, Hollub was in Paris meeting with Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne to discuss Anadarko\u2019s African assets, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.  The two already had a relationship stemming from the Dolphin Gas Project, a Middle East cross-border gas initiative where both companies have an equal share. Total had made it known to her that they coveted Anadarko\u2019s properties, including a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique.  \u201cVicki wanted to show that she could quickly put the cash on the table. In less than 10 days she had the cash ready,\u201d a Paris-based source said.  Omaha, Nebraska was next. Buffett is known for moving quickly when a deal piques his interest, but he tends to avoid getting involved in hostile takeover bids.  The meeting was set up by BofA CEO Brian Moynihan, whose bank was helping to provide financing for the Anadarko deal. Hollub later said Buffett was \u201cwarm and wonderful\u201d in their meeting, a source familiar with the discussions said.  Buffett, cash flush and on the hunt for new deals, agreed to provide $10 billion in financing in return for an 8 percent premium, a concern for dividend-focused shareholders who believe the terms are too pricey.  The two deals enabled Hollub to submit a revised offer on Sunday, increasing the cash component from 50 percent to 78 percent.  On Thursday, Chevron said it would collect its $1 billion termination fee and walk away from the negotiations.","182":"FILE PHOTO: The logo for Occidental Petroleum is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY.N on Tuesday laid out a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at its operations to net zero by 2040, becoming the latest oil and gas company to set long-term climate goals.  Oil and gas producers, under pressure from investors who want to see the industry operate more cleanly, have announced new emissions targets this year even as they have slashed spending and production following a coronavirus-driven plunge in crude prices.  Occidental will provide detail on its net-zero target by the end of November when it releases its sustainability report, Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said on an earnings call with analysts.  Hollub touted an August announcement that a unit of Occidental would finance development of the largest ever facility to pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere through a process known as direct air capture. Carbon dioxide from the Permian Basin oil field will be stored underground and used to increase pressure in the oil field and speed up production.  The project will lower Occidental\u2019s oil recovery costs and allow it to partner with companies that need to lower their own carbon footprint, Hollub said.  Royal Dutch Shell has laid out a strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. BP plans to increase its renewable power capacity 20-fold by 2030 while reducing its oil output by 40% and diverting more funds to low-carbon investments.  Occidental\u2019s direct air capture project will not require much investment in 2021, Hollub said. The producer will not spend more than $2.9 billion on new projects next year, an amount that would keep its oil and gas output flat.  It posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss on Monday and has cut jobs and production this year, piling pressure on a company that took on significant debt to acquire Anadarko Petroleum for $38 billion last year.

If the state is successful in its bid, terms will be subject to approval by the board, which also voted to hold four public hearings on any potential purchase in locations throughout the state.  Occidental acquired the land and minerals with its 2019 purchase of Anadarko. It is the largest private landowner in Wyoming, where it is focused mainly on development in the Powder River Basin.  The sale includes about 1 million acres (405,000 hectares) of land and 4 million acres (1.6 million hectares) in mineral rights once owned by the federal government, sold to Union Pacific Railroad and later acquired by Anadarko.

Financials and other cyclical groups, which often outperform when the economic outlook improves, declined. Only two of the 11 major S&P sectors were positive, with tech leading.
